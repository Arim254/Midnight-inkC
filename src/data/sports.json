    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Championship Round takes place on Sunday as the Broncos host the New England Patriots (-5.5) at 3 p.m. ET and the Seahawks host the Rams (+2.5) at 6:30 p.m. ET. While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +242 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction. Before making any Championship Round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Championship Round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.1 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Championship Round NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $1.1 million for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top Championship Round NFL parlay picksFor the Championship Round, one of the picks featured in the parlay is taking Denver's Zach Allen to have 1+ sacks (+191) versus the Patriots. Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

Flores was on an expiring contract after serving as Minnesota's defensive coordinator for the past three seasons and recently interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers for their head jobs. If he's not hired to lead one of those teams, Flores will return to the Vikings.\"Brian has a unique ability to connect with players, understand their skill sets, and put them in positions to maximize their impact on the field,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said. \"The identity of our defense is a reflection of his leadership and preparation. On a personal level, I've really valued the relationship we've built over the last three years, and that shared trust, alignment and high standard will continue to be critical to our success.\"Flores, 44, spent 15 seasons on Bill Belichick's staff with the New England Patriots. He won four Super Bowls with the Patriots, including one as the team's de facto defensive coordinator. Flores was credited with helping the Patriots hold the Rams to just three points in Super Bowl LIII. \nFlores parlayed his success in New England into his first head coaching opportunity with the Miami Dolphins, who hired him ahead of the 2019 season. After losing his first seven games in Miami, Flores guided the Dolphins to five wins in their final nine games. He was fired two years later despite leading the Dolphins to back-to-back winning seasons. Shortly after his firing, Flores sued the NFL, the Dolphins, New York Giants and Denver Broncos alleging racial discrimination. He then spent one season with the Pittsburgh Steelers as linebackers coach before becoming the Vikings' defensive coordinator. \nFlores was added to O'Connell's staff in Minnesota ahead of the 2023 season. In 2024, his defense finished fifth in the NFL in points allowed as the Vikings went 14-3 during the regular season. The Vikings allowed the seventh-fewest points in the league in 2025. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Mets have bolstered their rotation with one of the top starters in the game. New York is set to acquire two-time All-Star Freddy Peralta in a four-player trade with the Milwaukee Brewers, the teams announced late Wednesday. Pitcher Tobias Myers is also going to the Mets, while prospects Brandon Sproat and Jett Williams are headed back to Milwaukee.Peralta, 29, is the latest big-name Brewer to get traded away one year prior to free agency, joining Corbin Burnes and Devin Williams. Milwaukee picked up Peralta's bargain $8 million club option earlier this offseason, but once Brandon Woodruff accepted the $22.025 million qualifying offer, the club ran into payroll issues. The Peralta trade clears money and adds talent.\nThis past season was a career year for Peralta, who finished fifth in the National League Cy Young voting. He made 30 starts for the third straight season and set new career bests in wins (17), innings (176 ⅔), ERA (2.70), and WAR (5.5). That 5.5 WAR was fourth in the NL and eighth among all pitchers. Peralta is, unquestionably, one of the game's best starting pitchers.With the Mets, he will headline a rotation that includes some combination of standout rookie Nolan McLean, Jonah Tong, Clay Holmes, Sean Manaea, David Peterson and Kodai Senga. President of baseball operations David Stearns, who worked with Peralta in Milwaukee, had been vocal about his wish for a frontline starter for the 2026 season.\n\"Acquiring Freddy adds another established starter to help lead our rotation,\" Stearns said in a statement. \"Throughout the offseason, we sought to complement our rotation with another front-end pitcher, and we're thrilled we are able to bring Freddy to the Mets.\"This caps a busy offseason for the Mets, which also saw them add Bo Bichette, Marcus Semien, Luis Robert Jr., Jorge Polanco, and others while bidding adieu to mainstays like Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil, Brandon Nimmo, and Edwin Díaz.Even after trading away their ace, the NL Central champion Brewers boast impressive rotation depth. Their rotation depth chart currently looks like this:\nRHP Brandon WoodruffRHP Jacob MisiorowskiRHP Quinn PriesterRHP Chad PatrickRHP Logan HendersonLHP Robert GasserLHP DL HallWith a typical Peralta season in 2026, the Mets will be able to make him the qualifying offer next offseason and receive a compensation draft pick should he sign elsewhere. That would offset the trade cost a bit. And, of course, there is always the possibility of a long-term extension, which is preferable to a compensation draft pick.Peralta is entering the final option year of a five-year, $15.5 million contract extension he signed in February 2020. That contract included $8 million club options for both 2024 and 2025, making Peralta one of the game's top pitching bargains.Myers, 27, made six starts and 16 relief appearances for the Brewers in 2025. Over parts of two MLB seasons, he has an ERA+ of 132 and an FIP of 3.92 in 188 ⅔ innings. \nAs for the Brewers' side of things, the outfielder Williams was ranked by CBS Sports as the No. 14 prospect in the National League East. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up: \"Williams will test your preconceived notions. He's a 5-foot-7 speedster who has experience at all three up-the-middle positions. Yet his offensive game isn't built on a strong foundation of bat-to-ball skills. Rather, he's all about the slug. Williams lifts and pulls the ball at high frequencies, allowing him to get the most from pedestrian strength markers. The downside here is that Williams swings and misses a lot (he had a 73.5% contact rate in Triple-A), meaning he's likely to strike out around a quarter of the time in the majors. He should provide enough of everything else -- power, walks, defense, and baserunning -- to enjoy a big-league career. It just won't be the one you'd expect at first blush.\"The 25-year-old Sproat is a right-hander who made four starts for the Mets last season. Across parts of two minor-league campaigns, the University of Florida product pitched to a 3.83 ERA and a 2.57 K/BB ratio in 48 starts and two relief appearances. During his brief stint in the majors in 2025, Sproat averaged 96 mph with his fastball. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After having another promising season derailed by injury, the San Francisco 49ers will evaluate everything this offseason, including looking into whether or not excessive exposure to electromagnetic force (EMF) is contributing to the team's alarming injury rate. Specifically, 49ers general manager John Lynch said the team will investigate a viral conspiracy theory that the electrical substation near their training facility and Levi's Stadium is having an impact on the team's injuries. The substation (which is operated by Silicon Valley Power) expanded in 2014 with the opening of Levi's Stadium. The theory was mentioned by receiver Kendrick Bourne after tight end George Kittle tore his right Achilles during the 49ers' wild card playoff win over the Philadelphia Eagles. And while the theory has been debunked by scientists and other medial professionals, the 49ers aren't taking anything to chance. \"We've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means? That's what we know exists,\" 49ers general manager John Lynch said, via ESPN. \"We've heard that debunked. ... The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pore into it. Our ownership, Jed [York] is tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened, but yeah, we aren't going to turn a blind eye.\"Given their injury numbers in recent years, it's easy to see why the 49ers will at least do their due diligence to look into this theory. This season, the 49ers dealt with significant injuries to several key players, including Kittle, pass rusher Nick Bosa (torn ACL), linebacker Fred Warner (fractured and dislocated ankle), quarterback Brock Purdy (turf toe) and rookie pass rusher Mykel Williams (torn ACL). \nDespite those and other injuries, the 49ers went 12-5 during the regular season while playing in the NFL's toughest division. But if the 49ers want to win their first Super Bowl since 1994, they're going to have to find a way to get more of their players to the finish line. With that in mind, Lynch said the 49ers will look over their entire process this offseason in an effort to have a healthier team moving forward. \n\"The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game,\" Lynch said. \"What we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries. And I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. And that process has begun. It never frankly stopped. But yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA still does not have a CBA, but it does have a 2026 schedule. On Wednesday, the league announced the full schedule for its historic 30th season, which will run from May 8 through Sept. 24. The 2026 playoffs will begin on Sept. 27. There will be a two-week break in early September to accommodate the FIBA Women's World Cup. Once again, each team will play 44 games. Last season was the first time that teams played 44 games, which was an all-time high. Additionally, this season will feature the debut of two expansion franchises, the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, which will bring the league to 15 teams. Overall, there will be 330 total games, which will be a league record. A full broadcast and streaming schedule will be released at a later date. \"As we prepare to tip off the WNBA's historic 30th season, this schedule reflects both how far the league has come and the momentum that continues to drive us forward,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a press release. \"From welcoming two new organizations in Toronto and Portland, to honoring our history with marquee matchups that connect the league's first game to today's stars, the 2026 season will celebrate the WNBA's past, present, and future. With a record number of games, growing global reach, and unprecedented momentum, this milestone season will help define the next chapter of the WNBA.\"How does the schedule release affect CBA negotiations?The number of games in a season is collectively bargained, so it was a surprise to see the schedule released without a new CBA in place. However, the league had no intention of going beyond 44 games -- the number that was played last season -- in 2026 due to the FIBA Women's World Cup. \nIt's possible that the two sides could agree to play more games in future seasons, but with neither side looking for an increase this season, the league was able to put the 2026 schedule in place. Doing so as soon as possible was an important step to allow teams, players and broadcast partners to begin preparations for the summer, including securing arena dates, arranging travel and selling tickets. \"Releasing the 2026 schedule is a key step as we prepare for the WNBA's 30th season and allows teams, partners, broadcasters, and fans to begin the essential planning for the year ahead,\" a WNBA spokesperson told CBS Sports. It remains unclear when a new CBA will be in place, though the schedule release suggests that real progress is being made. \n\n        \n            \n                WNBA free agency: How are continued CBA negotiations affecting offseason schedule?\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are the highlights from Wednesday's schedule release:Opening weekendOnce again, opening night is slated for a Friday, which will set up an action-packed opening weekend.

This year's competition will run from June 1-17, with the championship game scheduled for June 30. Each team will play every other team in its conference once during the group stage. The conferences are currently imbalanced, so Eastern Conference teams will play six games, while Western Conference teams will play seven games. The team from each conference with the best winning percentage in group stage games will qualify for the championship. The team with the best overall winning percentage will host the championship. \nAnniversary of first-ever gameThe New York Liberty and Los Angeles Sparks, two of the original six franchises, faced off in the league's first-ever game on June 21, 1997. In honor of the league's 30th anniversary, the Liberty and Sparks will meet again on the same day, June 21, in Los Angeles. All-Star GameAll-Star Weekend will return to Chicago this summer, with the Sky hosting for the second time in franchise history. All-Star Friday Night, featuring the Skills Challenge and 3-Point Contest is set for July 24 at Wintrust Arena (home of the Sky). The All-Star Game will follow on Saturday, July 25 at the United Center (home of the NBA's Chicago Bulls). \nWorld Cup breakThe 2026 FIBA Women's World Cup is set for Sept. 4-13 in Germany, so the WNBA will go on pause from Aug. 30 through Sept. 16 so that players can represent their countries.

    "body": "\n        NFC West rivals collide for the third time in the 2025 NFL season as the Los Angeles Rams head to the Pacific Northwest to face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, Jan. 25. These teams played two thrilling games during the regular season, but this game is for all the marbles, as the winner advances to Super Bowl LX and the loser goes home. At DraftKings Sportsbook, the Seahawks are the +145 favorite to win the Super Bowl while the Rams are right behind them at +230. It's safe to say the winner of this game is expected to go on to win the NFL championship.Here's a look at what fans and bettors need to know for Sunday's NFC Championship Game between the Rams and Seahawks, including the latest odds, model picks, injury reports and weather conditions. All odds are from DraftKings.Rams at Seahawks (6:30 p.m. ET)\nSpread: Seahawks -2.5Money line: Rams +130, Seahawks -155Total: 46.5 (Over -115, Under -105)At one point this season, the Rams were 9-2 and on their way to the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Los Angeles would lose a road game at Carolina, part of a five-game stretch where the team lost three games. One of those losses was an overtime game against the Seahawks in which the Rams blew a 16-point lead. That result ultimately cost them the top seed and gave Seattle homefield advantage for the playoffs. Matthew Stafford is trying to cap off his MVP-level season with another Super Bowl win and will be playing in his second NFC title game, while head coach Sean McVay is appearing in his third. The Rams got Davante Adams back from a hamstring injury for the playoffs but he has not been able to find the end zone despite leading the league in touchdown receptions. McVay said he expects Byron Young and Emmanuel Forbes Jr., two starters on L.A.'s defense, to be fine for the championship game after both suffered injuries in the win over the Bears. The Rams won the Wild Card game against the Panthers 34-31 and then outlasted Chicago 20-17 in overtime to make the NFC title game.Bet on the Rams to defeat the Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game at DraftKings, where new users can get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of $5 or more wins:\nSeattle had a much easier path to the NFC Championship game, demolishing the San Francisco 49ers from the jump. Rashid Shaheed took the opening kickoff to the house and the Seahawks never looked back. They'll have fond memories of their overtime win against the Rams in Week 16, part of a seven-game winning streak. The Seahawks could've swept the Rams in the regular season but Jason Myers missed what would've been a game-winning field goal in a 21-19 L.A. win in Week 11. Sam Darnold, who battled an oblique injury in the win over San Francisco, threw four interceptions in that contest and has had problems against the Rams in recent games. It was L.A. who sacked Darnold nine times in last year's playoff game when the quarterback was with the Vikings, ultimately pushing him out of Minnesota. The Seahawks won't be complaining much, as Darnold steered an offense which was tied for seventh in yards per game and ranked third in points per game. However, Seattle's calling card is defense. Head coach Mike Macdonald has built one of the best defensive units in the league, and that alone could carry Seattle to the Super Bowl. The Seahawks were the best scoring defense in the league and did bottle up the Rams successfully once, but also surrendered 37 points in the second matchup. The Seahawks will be without running back Zach Charbonnet for the rest of the year but could be getting some reinforcements on the offensive line with Josh Jones and Charles Cross both potentially being able to suit up.Temperatures in Seattle are expected to be in the mid 40s at kickoff and there's no precipitation in the area, which likely gives the Rams a slight edge. Los Angeles struggled to deal with the elements in Carolina and Chicago in these playoffs. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, sees the Seahawks covering the 2.5-point spread in 58% of simulations, good for an \"A\" grade. The model has Seattle winning outright in 62% of simulations and Under hits in 55% of simulations. \nBack the Seahawks to cover the spread against the Rams at DraftKings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Mets have regrouped nicely, huh? Their offseason got off to a disastrous start, but they've filled in most of their holes with impact players, the latest being Freddy Peralta, who was acquired in a trade Wednesday night for a pair of top-100 prospects. Let's dive into the Fantasy implications of this deal for both sides:Mets acquire Freddy PeraltaPeralta slides right into the top of the Mets rotation with this move. He's not your prototypical, innings-eating ace, but he's typically very good when he's on the mound. There are more ups and downs than you'd prefer – there's a lot of Blake Snell, albeit less extreme on both ends of the spectrum – but at the end of the day, Peralta typically puts in 160-175 innings of a mid-3.00s ERA and 200 or so strikeouts.And he's moving to one of the few spots around baseball that might not represent a huge downgrade from the one he was in in Milwaukee. The Mets probably won't match the Brewers' 97 wins from a year ago, but this should be a very competitive team, with a good home park and a great defense backing him up. Bo Bichette is unproven at third base, but if he can handle it, the Mets could have plus defense at the key infield positions, plus left field and center field. It's a nice landing spot, if you have to leave one as good as Milwaukee.Peralta, of course, already costs quite a bit in Fantasy drafts, with his ADP up to 69.1 in NFBC drafts in the month of January. I think that's probably an overpay based on last year's inflated win total and unsustainably low ERA (2.70 ERA compared to a 3.47 xERA), but that doesn't mean I think Peralta is likely to be a bad pick – 200 strikeouts and good, but not great ratios never goes out of style. And his new landing spot should help him sustain his value. As long as his price doesn't keep rising, he represents a solid, albeit imperfect choice for the No. 2 spot in your rotation.\nPeralta's value holds steady, so the more interesting side of the deal comes from the prospects the Mets gave up to get him. Brewers acquire Jett Williams, Brandon SproatLet's meet WilliamsFor one year of Peralta's services, the Brewers acquired a pair of top-100 prospects in shortstop Jett Williams and pitcher Brandon Sproat. Sproat has made his MLB debut while Williams got to Triple-A last season, so they not only got two top-100 prospects, but they got two who could help their team in 2026. Now, a quick note before we move on: I am, personally, not a huge fan of either of the players the Brewers acquired here. It's giving me shades of the Corbin Burnes trade from a few years ago, one the Brewers haven't gotten much out of. I'll note where my skepticism with each lies, but I'll also lean on others' scouting reports to provide both sides of the argument. \nLet's start with Williams, the more highly regarded of the two.One way Williams fits with the Brewers is his height: He is just 5'7\", so he'll fit right in with the likes of Caleb Durbin and Sal Frelick, two other diminutive recent prospect graduates. And, as you might expect, Williams doesn't hit the ball especially hard – in his brief Triple-A debut in 2025, he had just an 86 mph average exit velocity and 34% hard-hit rate, both of which were solidly below average marks. However, he manages to be functionally about average as a power hitter thanks to a strong approach at the plate and a high pulled-air rate, which helps him take advantage of the shorter fences in left field. The combination of solid contact skills and a proclivity for elevating the ball to the pull side should help him avoid being totally punchless, similar to how Durbin has emerged as a double-digit homer sources despite his diminutive size and exit velocity readings.Where my skepticism with Williams comes from is the plate discipline side. He tends to be overly passive, which leads to high walk rates in the minors but can be exploited in the majors. It's one thing if you just have preternaturally good swing decisions, but that isn't necessarily the case for Williams – at Triple-A, he was in the 78th percentile in chase rate, but was also in just the 27th percentile for in-zone swings. He lets a lot of strikes go past him searching for the right pitches he can drive, but major-league pitchers are much more willing and able to challenge hitters in the zone if they think they aren't going to hurt them. It's easy to fall behind with that approach. \nThat's not a death knell for Williams, but there just aren't a ton of players with below average pop who can make this kind of approach work. But there is one notable comp if you want to be optimistic: Geraldo Perdomo, who had below-average quality of contact metrics and the eighth-lowest in-zone swing rate in baseball in 2025, but made it work by making a ton of contact when he did swing, drawing a lot of walks when he didn't, and elevating the ball to the pull side and hitting a lot of line drives.Williams ranked 64th on Scott White's top-100 prospects list published earlier this week, and he had this to say: \"Williams bounced back nicely from an injury-wrecked 2024, particularly if you just look at his .281/.390/.477 slash line at Double-A and give him a pass for his bumpy transition to Triple-A. He still sells out harder for power than his 5-foot-7 frame suggests he should, though. There's a scrappy leadoff hitter in here -- one who's more likely to wind up at second base than shortstop -- but his current approach presents real batting average risk.\"\nThe Brewers have some depth up the middle, but shortstop is pretty clearly their biggest position of weakness with Joey Ortiz coming off a .593 OPS in 2025. They might prioritize Ortiz's steady glove hand in the short term, but if he hits like that again, Williams will have an opportunity to play before long, even if it doesn't seem super likely to come right out of Spring Training -- and Williams does have experience at second base and in the outfield, and flexibility always makes a path to playing time easier to find. And there is some power/speed upside here if he hits (Williams hit 17 homers and stole 34 bases in 130 games as a 21-year-old in 2025), too. Let's meet SproatSproat's value as a prospect has been on quite a ride in recent years, not unlike Williams. The former second-round pick garnered a lot of hype for his 2024 breakout, but he sputtered during a late callup to Triple-A and then nearly fell off prospect radars entirely when followed that up with a 5.43 ERA through the end of June to open 2025. But he switched up his approach, prioritized a sinker over his four-seamer and became a weak-contact inducing machine, posting a 2.72 ERA in July and August before a September promotion to the majors.Sproat held his own against big-leaguers, but some of the issues that cropped up early in the season came back. He struggled a bit with his command and didn't miss many bats, with his fastballs proving especially hittable. He has a deep arsenal and throws comfortably in the upper 90s, but Sproat's fastballs just aren't great, especially his four-seamer. He has struggled at times to maintain his velocity deep into games, too, presenting some real relief risk as he has grown up as a prospect.\nBut he racks up a lot of ground balls, has shown strikeout upside, and has had stretches of really good control before getting to Triple-A. It's not hard to see a solid major-leaguer here, but given that Sproat has been an older prospect and is already 25, I'm not sure there's a ton of upside here, either. Here's what Scott had to say about Sproat while ranking him as his No. 93 prospect: \"Sproat has fallen about 60 spots from last year's top 100, his ordinary fastball shape having been exposed with his move up to Triple-A, but he began emphasizing his sinker as the year went on and partially salvaged his stat line with a 2.44 ERA, 0.93 WHIP and 10.7 K/9 over his final 11 starts. He probably won't be much of a bat-misser at the highest level, which limits his ceiling, but he does excel at inducing weak grounders.\"There's a path for Sproat to make the Brewers rotation out of spring, but he's probably on the outside looking in for now. It's a nice landing spot on a team that tends to wring the most out of flawed young pitchers, and I could see Sproat having an outcome like Quinn Priester's, who emerged as a useful, albeit-kind-of-boring pitcher in 2025, with a 3.32 ERA but only 7.6 K/9. \nThat ain't nothing. But it's not something Fantasy players need to get excited about until we see some signs of success against major-league hitters. Sproat is pretty easy to pass on in 12-team leagues, and even in 15-teamers he probably shouldn't be drafted until we know he has a rotation spot. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Conference championship weekend is here. After 272 regular-season games and 10 postseason games, there are just three games left before we crown a Super Bowl champion in two weeks' time.With just four teams remaining in the playoffs and each one win away from a trip to Santa Clara to play for the Lombardi Trophy, it's of paramount importance to have each and every player available.Of course, we already know that won't be the case for multiple teams. The Denver Broncos will be without starting quarterback Bo Nix after he suffered an ankle fracture during the Divisional Round win over the Buffalo Bills, and the Seattle Seahawks will be without running back Zach Charbonnet after he tore his ACL during the win over the San Francisco 49ers.As for the rest of the players dealing with injuries this week, see below for the initial practice reports for each team.New England Patriots (-4.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nPatriots: New England listed both Harold Landry III (knee) and Marte Mapu (hip) as not practicing Wednesday. Meanwhile, Carlton Davis (concussion protocol), Christian Elliss (hip), Thayer Munford Jr. (knee), Hunter Henry (rest) and Morgan Moses (rest) were listed as limited. Joshua Farmer (hamstring), TreVeyon Henderson (shoulder), Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol) and Robert Spillane (hand) were listed on the report but practiced in full. New England could have some issues on defense if Landry, Mapu, Davis and Elliss are unable to go Sunday.Broncos: Bo Nix (ankle) did not practice for Denver. J.K. Dobbins (foot) was limited, as were Troy Franklin (hamstring), Pat Bryant (concussion protocol) and Alex Forsyth (ankle). Frank Crum (ankle), Lucas Krull (foot), Drew Sanders (ankle), JL Skinner (quad) and Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) were on the report but were full participants. Jarrett Stidham will start in Nix's place. The Broncos could be whole in the backfield with Dobbins potentially returning, but their receiver corps could take a hit if Franklin and Bryant can't get back in the lineup.\n        \n            \n                Jarrett Stidham hopes to join Nick Foles, Tom Brady, Kurt Warner, other backup QBs to start in a Super Bowl\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nRams: Quentin Lake (illness) and Byron Young (knee) did not practice. Emmanuel Forbes (shoulder) was limited. Josaiah Stewart (knee) was listed but practiced in full. The Rams are pretty healthy but could have some defensive issues, particularly in the secondary, if things don't progress.\nSeahawks: Charles Cross (foot), Josh Jones (knee/ankle) and Amari Knight (knee) did not practice for Seattle. Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited, as were Bryce Cabeldue (knee), Demarcus Lawrence (rest), Uchenna Nwosu (hamstring), Robbie Ouzts (neck), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (rest) and Leonard Williams (rest). Elijah Arroyo (knee) returned to full participation but was listed on the report, as were George Holani (hamstring), Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and Chazz Surratt (ankle). Seattle could have some offensive line issues if Cross and Jones can't go. Darnold played through his injury last week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If the Denver Broncos are going to play for a Super Bowl, it will be without quarterback Bo Nix, who recently underwent ankle surgery following his season-ending injury during the final moments of Denver's AFC divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills. As his team prepares for Sunday's AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, Nix summed up his emotions in a lengthy Instagram post. Nix called the injury \"some of the most devastating football news\" he's ever received. And while he is struggling with the notion of not being on the field with his teammates, Nix is confident the Broncos are still capable of winning with backup Jarrett Stidham leading the offense. The last few days have been hard to put into words. What started as one of the most exciting games I've ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I've ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it. I can't express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them. I couldn't be more proud of our guys. I couldn't be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn't be more excited for what's next. Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me. God never says oops, and he is always good. He has big plans for this team. We're not finished, as a matter of fact we're just getting started. We're just going to keep climbing higher. Go Broncos.Nix's injury halted what would have been an intriguing showdown between two of the league's rising young quarterbacks with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye on the other sideline. Members of the 2024 NFL Draft class, Maye and Nix have enjoyed fast starts to their careers. Nix helped the Broncos snap their 10-year drought without a playoff appearance as a rookie. This past Sunday, he led Denver to its first postseason victory since its win over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. \nWhile his team didn't have much success in 2024, Maye did earn Pro Bowl honors after completing an impressive 66.6% of his passes. This year, he led the NFL with a 72% completion percentage while leading the Patriots to their first 14-win season since 2016.  \nWhile Nix and Maye won't get the chance to match wits on Sunday, there is another point of intrigue in Stidham trying to join the surprisingly long list of backup quarterbacks who have led their teams to the big game. That list includes Jeff Hostetler, the former New York Giants quarterback who helped Bill Parcells win his fourth Super Bowl with Big Blue. \nBroncos coach Sean Payton -- a Parcells disciple -- is hoping to emulate his former boss by becoming the latest coach to win it all with a backup quarterback.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula and president/general manager Brandon Beane held a press conference on Wednesday morning to, among other things, explain the decision to fire deposed head coach Sean McDermott. During that press conference, Pegula appeared to take a shot at wide receiver Keon Coleman, deflecting blame for the draft choice from Beane and assigning it to McDermott. \"The coaching staff pushed to draft Keon,\" Pegula said. \"I'm not saying Brandon wouldn't have drafted him, but he wasn't his next choice. That was Brandon being a team player and taking advice of his coaching staff who felt strongly about the player. He's taken, for some reason, heat over it, and not saying a word about it. I'm here to tell you the true story.\"Evidence to the contrary of this claim has already emerged in two different forms. The first is a clip of Beane saying that he was glad Coleman ran the 40-yard dash in 4.57 seconds because that would make it easier for the Bills to land him in the draft. And the second is another clip of Beane saying that he knew he wanted to draft Coleman unless some other team blew the Bills away with a trade offer for the No. 33 overall pick in the 2024 draft. Regardless of who was the driving force behind a pick that has clearly not worked out -- Coleman has been ineffective in his role and also had off-the-field issues that led to his being a healthy scratch for multiple games this season -- it was wildly inappropriate for an owner to hang Coleman himself out to dry like this, seemingly declaring him a failed experiment while Coleman is still on the team. \nIt would seem to be untenable for Coleman to return to the Bills in 2026 in the wake of these comments. This isn't something you just put your head down and forget about. So with that in mind, we want to take a look at a few potential landing spots that might make sense for Coleman as a \"second draft\" type of prospect who could be rehabilitated in a new situation. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThe Chiefs need a big-bodied outside receiver to complement Rashee Rice in the slot and Xavier Worthy as their speed option on the perimeter. Coleman has largely struggled at the things he'd need to do to be an effective weapon for another team, but perhaps a change of scenery would help unlock more of what he showed during his time in college. He's not going to find many teams with an equivalent or better quarterback than Josh Allen, but Kansas City provides one of those options in Patrick Mahomes.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersWith Brandon Aiyuk having played his last down with the Niners and Jauan Jennings hitting free agency, San Francisco could have a need for an outside receiver as well. Kyle Shanahan has always shown an ability to put players in position to succeed, so if there is anyone out there who might be able to unlock the best of what Coleman has to offer, it might be him.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Steelers desperately need some help across from DK Metcalf at the wide receiver position. They can't come into next season with guys like Roman Wilson and Calvin Austin III as the primary complements to Metcalf. Coleman could make sense as a buy-low option while they make larger investments in free agency or the draft. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans SaintsThe Saints, like the Steelers, need a complement to their No. 1 wide receiver. New Orleans has guys like DeVaughn Vele and Kevin Austin Jr. behind Chris Olave but probably needs to find Tyler Shough more to work with to make sure that he shows progress next season after putting together a pretty strong rookie season. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee TitansThe Titans don't even really have a No. 1 wide receiver given the way Calvin Ridley's season went, so they need to take as many shots as possible at pass catchers this offseason in order to give Cam Ward a better chance for success after they put him in so many tough situations during his rookie year. Coleman isn't going to be a reliable solution, but taking a dice-roll at a low cost could make some degree of sense.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Brandon Aiyuk didn't play a single snap for the San Francisco 49ers in 2025, and it appears that the veteran receiver won't in 2026, either. Aiyuk and the 49ers will eventually part ways following two tumultuous years that included a contentious contract negotiation, a season-ending knee injury and a voided contract. \"I think it's safe to say he's played his last snap with the 49ers,\" 49ers general manager John Lynch told reporters, four days after San Francisco's season-ending loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC divisional round. While he initially signed through the 2028 season, the 49ers set in motion the prospect of releasing him this offseason after they voided the $27 million of 2026 salary guarantees in the four-year, $120 million contract extension he signed in August on 2024. Aiyuk played in just seven games since signing his contract extension. He played in seven games in 2024 before tearing the ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee. Aiyuk was put on the physically unable to perform list in July and has yet to be cleared by the 49ers. \nThe 49ers then voided the 2026 guarantees in Aiyuk's contract after he basically stopped showing up for work. \"It takes a lot of things to get a contract voided,\" 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said during the season. \"I've never dealt with that in my career and been in any building that's had that.\" \nPrior to 2024, Aiyuk enjoyed a productive career with the 49ers, who took him with the 25th overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft. In 2022, he eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards for the first time while also catching a career-high eight touchdowns. The following season, he recorded a career-high 1,342 receiving yards while helping the 49ers reach the Super Bowl. \n            \n    ",

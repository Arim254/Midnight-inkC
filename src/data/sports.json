    "body": "\n        Two of the top three scoring offenses will meet on 'Thursday Night Football,' providing quite the NFL DFS player pool for the Dallas Cowboys vs. Detroit Lions matchup at 8:15 p.m. ET. Detroit is a 3-point home favorite, while the over/under is 54.5, the highest on the board in Week 14. Dak Prescott, Jared Goff, Jahmyr Gibbs and CeeDee Lamb are names known to casual football fans and names very familiar with being included in NFL DFS lineups. However, Detroit could be shorthanded with Sam LaPorta on the IR and Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) a game-time decision after not practicing this week. George Pickens (calf/knee) doesn't carry an injury designation for TNF.Wideout Isaac TeSlaa played 92% of snaps in Detroit's last game and scored his third touchdown of the year. Daily Fantasy football lineups need economical options like TeSlaa to balance out the highly-priced stars. The Cowboys also have NFL daily Fantasy sleepers who could provide a great return on investment on TNF.

The wideout is coming off a 7-112-1 stat line on Thanksgiving versus Kansas City, with the 112 yards matching a season high. Lamb is averaging 82.7 receiving yards per game in 2025, which ranks sixth-best in the NFL, and his career high of 227 yards came versus Detroit in 2023. This year's Lions team has allowed the third-most touchdowns to opposing wideouts, and now it will be without starting cornerback, Terrion Arnold (shoulder), who was placed on injured reserve on Monday. Detroit also allowed four touchdowns to wideouts in last week's loss to Green Bay. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also rostering Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs, who has been a one-man show over the last half-dozen games. Gibbs is averaging 152.3 scrimmage yards with eight total touchdowns over his last six contests, compared to 83.7 yards and five scores over his first six games. The two-time Pro Bowler is on pace for career highs in rushing yards, rushing average, receptions and receiving yards, with his 2025 production coming versus defenses much more stout than what Dallas possesses. The Cowboys have allowed the second-most points and the fourth-most yards this season, in addition to giving up the third-most receiving yards to running backs, which increases the value of a pass-catching RB like Gibbs. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Lions vs. Cowboys NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'.

The Detroit Lions (7-5) will host the Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) in a crucial NFC matchup. The SportsLine Projection Model finds the best value in this contest from backing the Cowboys as 3-point underdogs in its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook for online sports betting. The over/under for Cowboys vs. Lions is 55.5 points, the highest on the entire NFL Week 14 odds board.The model is also backing the Nets to cover as 4.5-point underdogs against the Jazz in NBA action, while one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a play from the Thursday college basketball slate. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 14 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookNets (+4.5) vs. JazzCowboys (+3) vs. Lions UC Davis (+9.5) vs. HawaiiCombining the model's three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +587 (risk $100 to win $587). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nNets (+4.5) vs. Jazz (-110)Don't look now, but the Brooklyn Nets are on a winning streak. The Nets have won back-to-back games for the first time all season, defeating the Hornets, 116-103, on Monday before knocking off the Bulls, 113-103, last night. Brooklyn is 5-16 on the year, but the Nets have received steady contributions from players such as Michael Porter Jr. and Nic Claxton. Porter is averaging 25.3 points per game in his first season in Brooklyn, including 34 points over his last two games. Claxton had 14 points, eight rebounds and nine assists against the Bulls. The Jazz are 7-13 and have lost their last four road games. The model projects the Nets to cover in 68% of simulations. Back the Nets at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Cowboys (+3) vs. Lions (-108)The Cowboys have won three straight games, knocking off the Eagles and Chiefs over the last two weeks, and any time you defeat both Super Bowl teams from the previous season over a short stretch, your team is clearly doing something right. For Dallas, they are doing things right on both sides of the ball, which has been a rarity this season. Dallas had one of the worst defenses in the NFL before the trade deadline, but adding defensive lineman Quinnen Williams from the Jets and linebacker Logan Wilson from the Bengals has changed that. The Cowboys are allowing 21.7 ppg over their last three games, compared to 30.8 ppg over their first nine contests. Offense has never been the issue, with Dallas ranking second in the league at 29.3 ppg, and with the Lions' offense battling some key injuries, the model projects Dallas to cover the spread in 50% of simulations. Given the possibility of a push with a 3-point Lions victory, the model sees Dallas +3 as the strongest option for Thursday Night Football. Back the Cowboys at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:UC Davis (+9.5) vs. Hawaii (-115)\"I have these teams rated closer than the large spread indicates,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"Both teams have played well the two times they stepped up in class. Hawaii has close losses to Arizona State and Oregon, while UC Davis upset Nevada and played tough at Colorado. I think the Rainbow Warriors' metrics are a bit overrated right now, thanks to a soft schedule. Another factor could be turnovers. Hawaii's biggest weakness is turnovers, and UC Davis pressures the ball at an above-average rate. Ten of the last 13 games between these two have been decided by eight points or less.\" Back UC Davis at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Thursday Night Football, NBA, college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Conference Championship week begins on Friday with four Group of Five contests, with at least one of these four conference champions guaranteed a spot in the College Football Playoff. The current College Football Playoff rankings would indicate that team is most likely the winner of the American Athletic Championship between No. 24 North Texas and No. 20 Tulane, as the two highest-ranked teams playing on Friday from the CFP polls. North Texas is a 2.5-point favorite in the latest college football odds despite being the lower-ranked team in the CFP polls. The other Friday conference championship games feature Kennesaw State (-2.5) vs. Jacksonville State in the Conference USA Championship on CBS Sports Network at 7 p.m. ET, Troy vs. No. 25 James Madison (-23.5) in the Sun Belt, and UNLV vs. Boise State (-3.5) in the Mountain West.The SportLine Projection Model has found values in all four of these conference championship games. Rather than backing a side for the AAC Championship showdown between Tulane and North Texas, the model finds the best value in playing Over 66.5 total points scored. The model is also backing Over 58.5 points in Boise State vs. UNLV, while projecting value a pair of underdogs in Jacksonville State (+2.5) and Troy (+23.5) for Friday's conference championship best bets. Before locking in your college football picks, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model. New users can also utilize the latest BetMGM bonus code, which gives new users up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is profitable on its top-rated money-line and over/under picks since the beginning of the 2024 season.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Jacksonville State (+2.5) vs. Kennesaw State (-110)Jacksonville State, the defending Conference USA champions, won this regular-season matchup, 35-26, on its home turf, which is where the Conference USA Championship Game will be played. The Gamecocks went 5-0 at home this season, and they'll have homefield advantage for the biggest game of the season. Kennesaw State went 9-3 overall and 7-1 in the conference, with its only loss coming to Jacksonville State, which also went 7-1 in Conference USA. Jacksonville State has the nation's leading rusher in Cam Cook, who has 1,588 rushing yards on 45.7 yards per carry this season. Cook rushed for 132 yards and a touchdown, and dual-threat quarterback Caden Creel threw for 137 yards and rushed for 127 yards and two touchdowns in their regular-season matchup. The model projects Jacksonville State to cover in 70% of simulations on Friday.Troy (+23.5) vs. James Madison (-105)Troy, the West Division champions, meets James Madison, the top team on the East side, in the Sun Belt Championship Game. Troy has won two of the last three Sun Belt championships, but James Madison joining the conference brings a strong, growing program into the Sun Belt Championship picture. These two teams didn't meet during the regular season, where Troy went 8-4 (6-2), and James Madison went 11-1 (8-0). Troy has only lost one game by more than 23 points this season, and it played Clemson tough in a 27-16 non-conference matchup, so it has been tested against stronger programs as well. The model projects Troy to cover in 61% of simulations.North Texas vs. Tulane: Over 66.5 points (-110)North Texas has the No. 1 scoring offense in the nation, averaging 46.4 points per game. The Mean Green are second in the nation in passing yards per game (324.5) behind freshman quarterback Drew Mestemaker. He has 3,835 passing yards with 29 touchdowns and four interceptions this season as the Mean Green have scored more than 50 points in three straight games and five of their last six contests. Meanwhile, Tulane can score as well, posting at least 26 points in five straight games. The model projects the Over to hit in 55% of simulations.UNLV vs. Boise State: Over 58.5 points (-108)These two teams went significantly Over this total during their regular-season meeting, which resulted in a 56-31 win for Boise State. They combined for 1,034 yards and 12 touchdowns, and the model expects the offenses to outshine the defenses again in the Mountain West Championship Game. Maddux Madsen threw for 253 yards and four touchdowns for Boise State, and he'll return after missing the last month with a leg injury. Dylan Riley rushed for 201 yards on 13.4 yards per rush for the Broncos in that contest. Anthony Colandrea, who has thrown for more than 3,000 yards this season, passed for 215 yards, rushed for 87 yards, and had three total touchdowns for UNLV against Boise State. The model projects the Over to hit in 63% of simulations.Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's college football best bets for Friday.

He hit his head on the turf, and the Cowboys' medical staff quickly ruled him out with a concussion, per the Amazon broadcast.Check out what happened, here:\nLamb was in the midst of another massive performance, as he caught six passes for 123 yards before exiting the contest. The four-time Pro Bowl receiver had caught 51 passes for 744 yards and three touchdowns in nine games played entering this week.This unfortunate development opens the door for George Pickens, who entered this week ranked No. 2 in receiving yards with 1,142. The former Pittsburgh Steeler and Lamb are the only duo in Cowboys history to average 80 receiving yards per game in a season. Naturally, Detroit's defense turned its focus to Pickens when Lamb exited, which gave Ryan Flournoy some opportunities to make plays. In the fourth quarter, he caught a 42-yard touchdown pass to pull Dallas within three points. \nIf there's a silver lining with the Lamb injury, it's that he's going to have more time to heal with Dallas on a mini bye. Up next for the Cowboys are the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 14. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas State officially hired legendary former quarterback Collin Klein as coach, the program announced Thursday. Klein, 36, had most recently served as Texas A&M's offensive coordinator. He succeeds Chris Klieman, who retired Wednesday, and 247Sports had reported Klein was in line to be the next head man in charge for the Wildcats.Klein will continue to coach the Aggies through the College Football Playoff.After redshirting at Kansas State in 2008, Klein played wide receiver in 2009 before converting to quarterback in 2010. He took over full-time behind center the next year, and across 2011 and 2012, he accumulated a 21-5 record, threw for 29 touchdowns, ran for 50 touchdowns and finished third in 2012 Heisman Trophy voting. The Wildcats reached as high as No. 2 in his senior season, tied for their highest ranking ever.Klein returned to Kansas State as a coach in 2014 and slowly worked his way up from low-level assistant to quarterbacks coach to co-offensive coordinator to, finally, offensive coordinator from 2022-23. Texas A&M hired him away after the 2023 season. Now, however, he returns to the place that made him a star.Klein's contract is for five years, with an average base salary of $4.3 million.Klieman, who took over for the iconic Bill Snyder in 2019 and was under contract through 2032, produced several strong seasons upon his arrival in Manhattan, including a 10-win campaign in 2022 and bowl wins in 2021, 2023 and 2024.But the Wildcats are just 6-6 this season after being ranked 17th in the AP preseason poll. They'll hope Klein -- the first Kansas State alum to be head coach since Ellis Rainsberger from 1975-77 -- can get things back on track.\nHere's more analysis from CBS Sports' Cody Nagel:He spent five seasons on Klieman's staff, including two as offensive coordinator, before departing for College Station ahead of the 2024 season. Klein's familiarity with Kansas State's roster, donors and recruiting base -- combined with his status as one of the program's most accomplished former players -- has made him the university's leading target as succession planning accelerates.As a coach, Klein quickly made his mark when he joined the staff in 2017. He served as Kansas State's offensive coordinator for two seasons in 2022-23, taking a unit that ranked outside the top 75 nationally in 2021 to top-25 rankings in multiple offensive categories before his departure. His offenses became known for efficiency and balance: total offense jumped from 362.3 yards per game in 2021 to 446.1 in 2023, scoring jumped from 27.5 to 37.8 points per game, and his final unit led the nation in red-zone touchdown conversion rate at 78.7%. The Wildcats' rushing attack also flourished, producing top-15 units nationally in yards per game, while quarterbacks posted school-record low interception percentages.After joining Texas A&M in 2024, Klein helped guide the Aggies to a 5-0 start in SEC play, marking the program's best conference start since 1998. The offense ranked second in the SEC in rushing behind a strong offensive line. Texas A&M ranks 16th nationally in scoring offense with 36.3 points per game this season. Klein is a semifinalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the top assistant coach in college football.\n            ",

Packers star edge defender Micah Parsons said Penn State should elevate Terry Smith, who served as the team's interim coach after the program fired James Franklin.Parsons, 26, said his relationship with Smith goes back to when he was 14 years old. Parsons starred at Penn State from 2018-19, recording five sacks and 14 tackles for loss as a sophomore in 2019. He opted out of the 2020 COVID-impacted season before going 12th overall to the Cowboys in 2021 NFL Draft.\nSmith played wide receiver at Penn State from 1987-91 and has been on Penn State coaching staff since 2014, working his way up from cornerbacks coach to associate head coach to, after six games this season, interim head coach. The Nittany Lions went 3-3 under Smith, winning each of their final three games to finish the regular season 6-6. The team awaits its bowl fate, though Smith has not been informed of his future.The on-field product took a back seat to a coaching search gone awry. Louisville's Jeff Brohm and BYU's Kalani Sitake are the latest coaches who signed extensions after being linked to the Nittany Lions' opening. Sitake, in particular, seemed close to heading to Happy Valley before a full-scale effort from the Cougars and their donors kept him at his alma mater.\nOverall, eight coaches who had been potentially tied to Penn State's opening received new contracts from their current team.CoachSchoolContract extensionCurt CignettiIndiana8 years, $93 millionMatt RhuleNebraska2 years, $25 millionMike ElkoTexas A&M6 years, $66+ millionEli DrinkwitzMissouri6 years, $64.5 millionClark LeaVanderbilt6 years, UnknownKalani SitakeBYUUnknownBrent KeyGeorgia Tech5 years, $32.5 millionJeff BrohmLouisvilleUnknown\n            \n    ",

Quarterback Dak Prescott ranks top two in the NFL in passing yards (3,261) and passing touchdowns (25) this season, and he expects another massive performance. When Prescott arrived at Ford Field Thursday afternoon, NFL Media's Jane Slater asked him what he remembers from his last game in Detroit. \"That we lit them up,\" Prescott said. \"Lot of passing yards. About to do it again.\"When Slater asked Prescott if she could quote him on that, he replied with a confident, \"sure.\"\nThe last time the Cowboys played in Detroit was in November 2019. In a 35-27 Cowboys victory, in which the Dallas offense racked up 509 yards of total offense, Prescott completed 29 of 46 passes for a whopping 444 yards and three touchdowns. Michael Gallup caught nine passes for 148 yards, while Randall Cobb caught four passes for 115 yards and a touchdown. The Lions were in an entirely different era, as Jeff Driskel started at quarterback, while Bo Scarbrough was Detroit's leading rusher.However, the last time the Lions and Cowboys met, it was not very pretty. Detroit eviscerated Dallas at AT&T Stadium last year, 47-9. It marked the largest home loss under Jerry Jones. \nPrescott cleared 300 yards passing in each of the last two games, and threw multiple touchdowns in both matchups as well. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, Prescott's passing yards Over/Under is set at 275.5. He averages 271.8 passing yards through 12 games this season. The Cowboys are 3.5-point underdogs. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Florida football staff continues to take shape around coach Jon Sumrall, and the Gators have a standout assistant in their sights. Georgia Tech offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner is expected to take the same job at Florida, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Brandon Marcello. Faulkner, a Broyles Award semifinalist, is widely regarded as one of the top offensive coordinators in college football and constructed a prolific unit over his three years with the Yellow Jackets.Georgia Tech is on pace to record the most efficient offense in school history under Faulkner's direction. The Yellow Jackets average 7.09 yards per play, which is good for ninth-most nationally and significantly greater than the program record of 6.81. Georgia Tech also ranks 12th in the country in total offense and boasts one of the most potent rushing attacks in the sport.Among Faulkner's greatest achievements is the development of quarterback Haynes King. The two arrived at Georgia Tech together in 2023, and the Yellow Jacket offense has done nothing but improve in the years since. King flourished as a Heisman Trophy hopeful and is among the premier running quarterbacks in college football with an ACC-leading 15 rushing touchdowns. King won the ACC Player of the Year award earlier this week.Faulkner has yet to hold an offensive coordinator position in the SEC but is no stranger to the conference. He spent time at Georgia as a graduate assistant in 2006 and returned in 2020 when he served as the Bulldogs' quarterbacks coach for three years.Sumrall already hired a defensive coordinator and will soon have his top two assistants on board. Florida formally announced the hiring of Kentucky defensive coordinator Brad White to the same position on Thursday.\nThe offensive coordinator hire will be particularly important considering Sumrall built most of his coaching experience in defensive-oriented jobs. Prior to his stints as head coach at Troy and Tulane, the former linebacker held coordinator and position coach roles on the defensive side of the ball. While Sumrall will oversee Florida's entire operation, he figures to effectively hand the keys to the offense to his coordinator.Florida seeks offensive renaissanceOffensive struggles plagued Florida during the Billy Napier era, so the looming arrival of a standout coordinator is a welcome development for the Gators. In averaging just 21.6 points per game during the 2025 season, Florida fielded the No. 110-ranked unit in the country. This year marked a step backward from the group despite heralded quarterback DJ Lagway stepping into the full-time starting job with ample promise.The Gators ranked no higher than No. 58 in scoring offense in any of Napier's four years at the helm, and the former coach took the brunt of the responsibility for the lack of output given his role as play-caller. Napier never relinquished his play-calling duties despite the middling results.\nFaulkner will be tasked with keeping the most vital pieces of the offense intact amid the coaching turnover, and it all starts at the quarterback spot with Lagway possessing two more years of eligibility. Wide receiver Vernell Brown III will also be a priority in talent retention after he led the Gators with 40 catches for 512 yards as a true freshman. Developing that tandem will be paramount in Faulkner's quest to deliver offensive improvement in his first year overseeing the unit.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Billy Napier is set to make his return to the Sun Belt Conference. James Madison is hiring Napier to fill the coaching vacancy left by Bob Chesney, sources confirmed to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Chesney will depart James Madison for UCLA whenever the Dukes' postseason run ends. James Madison is set to face off against Troy in the Sun Belt Championship Game on Friday, and the Dukes are also in College Football Playoff contention after they landed at No. 25 in that latest set of rankings. It didn't take long for Napier to land another job after he was fired by Florida in October amid a 3-4 start to the 2025 season. Napier's Gators entered the year at No. 15 in the AP Top 25 poll, and the expectation was that they would compete for a spot in the College Football Playoff after a solid close to the 2024 campaign and the return of several key contributors, including quarterback DJ Lagway and top offensive lineman Jake Slaughter. But an early upset loss to South Florida knocked Florida out of the rankings entirely and precipitated an early three-game losing skid for the Gators. A stunning win against No. 9 Texas wasn't enough to save Napier, who left Gainesville after four seasons and a 22-23 overall record. \nHe won just one bowl game with the Gators and never finished above .500 in conference play. Prior to his hiring at Florida, Napier spent four seasons as the coach at Louisiana from 2018-21. He's also served as an assistant at Clemson (2006-10), Colorado State (2012), Alabama (2013-16) and Arizona State (2017). Napier is proven in Sun Belt After taking huge swings on upside in each of its last two hiring cycles, James Madison is turning to a proven name to take it into its next era. No coach on the market comes with more high-level Sun Belt experience than Napier. \nHe was one of the Sun Belt's top coaches during his tenure at Louisiana. He led the Ragin' Cajuns to four-straight Sun Belt West division titles and won the conference two years in a row from 2020-21. Louisiana also finished ranked inside the top-20 of the AP poll in each of those seasons. He won at least 10 games from 2019-21 and boasted a 22-2 Sun Belt record in that same span. The Ragin' Cajuns also made a bowl in each of his four years with the program. He was the first coach since 2011-14 to lead Louisiana to four consecutive bowl games. Can Napier maintain James Madison's success?James Madison has emerged as one of the Group of Five's premier programs since its move from the FCS to the FBS level in 2022. Though he was never able to compete for a Sun Belt title due to the NCAA's regulations for schools in a transitional period, former coach Curt Cignetti was crucial for establishing James Madison's run of dominance. \nHe guided the Dukes to an 8-3 record in their first year as an FBS institution and followed that up with an 11-1 showing in 2023. James Madison finished atop the Sun Belt East division and earned a bid to the Armed Forces Bowl since there weren't enough eligible teams that qualified for a bowl. Cignetti parlayed that success into an opportunity at Indiana, where he has a 23-2 record over two seasons. The Hoosiers currently sit at No. 2 in the College Football Playoff Rankings and they're gearing up for a program-first appearance in the Big Ten Championship Game. James Madison hired Chesney, a former coach at FCS Holy Cross, to replace Cignetti. Chesney followed a solid 9-4 effort from 2024 with his 11-1 record this season, including a sterling 8-0 showing in Sun Belt play. Like Cignetti, Chesney used his success at JMU to earn a shot at UCLA. \n            ",

Imai's 45-day posting window ends at 5 p.m. ET on Jan. 2.\n        \n            \n                MLB free agency: What to know about NPB, KBO players to be posted this winter, including a home run champion\n                \n                    R.J.

Imanaga will re-join Matthew Boyd, Cade Horton, and Jameson Taillon in the rotation, with Javier Assad and Colin Rea serving as depth options. Lefty Justin Steele had elbow surgery in April and is not expected back until the middle of 2026 at the earliest.Further, the Cubs -- after failing to sign him last offseason -- have \"renewed interest\" in All-Star third baseman Alex Bregman, according to The Athletic. Though a quad injury limited him to 114 games, Bregman hit .273/.360/.462 with 3.5 WAR last season for the Red Sox. The Cubs had rookie Matt Shaw at third, where he played great defense while hitting .226/.295/.394 with 3.1 WAR. His offense was much improved in the second half.\nStill, there's a lot to consider here. Shaw has also played second base and Nico Hoerner is set to hit free agency after the 2026 season, as are corner outfielders Ian Happ and Seiya Suzuki. This is to say that adding Bregman would help solidify the position-player side for the long term and that Shaw's versatility means he wouldn't necessary need to be traded if Bregman were signed.  Tucker visits Blue Jays' spring facility  \nKyle Tucker, the offseason's No. 1 free agent, visited the Blue Jays' spring training complex in Dunedin, Fla., on Wednesday, reports FanSided. The visit indicates sincere mutual interest, though, as Sportsnet notes, it is a fairly common part of the recruiting process. Tucker is from nearby Tampa and could visit other spring complexes in the area (Phillies and Yankees, most notably).  The defending American League champions have been one of the offseason's most active teams already, signing Dylan Cease and Cody Ponce to reinforce what was already a strong rotation. The club could still re-sign shortstop Bo Bichette, though things have been fairly quiet on that front. Tucker fits Toronto's contact/power offensive approach and would improve an already strong team defense.  \n  \tMets interested in Ryan, Bellinger  \nCount the Mets among the teams with interest in Twins ace Joe Ryan, according to the New York Post. The club is known to be seeking a high-end starter this offseason and the Twins, who sold hard at the trade deadline, figure to listen to any and all offers for Ryan. New York's farm system is fairly deep, potentially giving them a leg up in trade discussions.  The Mets, as well as the crosstown rival Yankees, are also actively courting free agent outfielder Cody Bellinger, reports MLB Network. Even before trading away Brandon Nimmo, the Mets needed an outfielder this offseason, particularly one capable of playing center field. Bellinger qualifies, though his pull-heavy approach as a lefty hitter is a better fit for Yankee Stadium than Citi Field.    \tDodgers talking Hernández trade, have interest in Suarez  \nDodgers outfielder Teoscar Hernández has come up in trade discussions, according to The Athletic, but a trade is considered unlikely. The two-time defending World Series champions already need one outfielder this offseason. A Hernández trade would create an even greater need, though it would give the Dodgers a chance to get younger and better defensively in particular.  \nAlso, the Dodgers have expressed interest in free-agent closer Robert Suarez, reports The Athletic. The club would prefer a short-term deal with a high annual salary for the soon-to-be 35-year-old. The Dodgers have not yet shown interest in fellow free-agent closer Pete Fairbanks. Bullpen help is a priority this winter, especially after Tanner Scott's disappointing 2025 season.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tRed Sox seeking middle-of-the-order bat  A middle-of-the-order hitter is on the shopping list for the Red Sox at next week's Winter Meetings, chief baseball officer Craig Breslow told The Athletic recently. \"Someone who is a threat who can hit in the middle of the order and can  lengthen our lineup is going to be something we're going to pursue. That is  absolutely a path to improving our team,\" Breslow said.  Boston finished 15th in home runs in 2025 and their lineup leans left-handed at the moment. Alex Bregman fit very nicely both in the lineup and at third base, so adding a middle-of-the-order bat could simply mean re-signing Bregman. Pete Alonso would address Boston's power deficiency better than Bregman, but not improve the right side of the infield defense, which was a weakness in 2025.  \n D-backs have had talks with Fairbanks \nThe Diamondbacks have had talks with free-agent closer Pete Fairbanks, reports the Arizona Republic. Arizona figures to import lots of pitching this offseason, both starters and relievers. Their bullpen ranked 27th in ERA and 27th in WAR in 2025, and their two best relievers, righty Justin Martinez and lefty AJ Puk, will miss the start of 2026 after having elbow surgery in June. Unable to find a trade partner last month, the Rays declined their $11 million club option for Fairbanks and sent him out into free agency. The reliever market is really moving -- Ryan Helsley, Phil Maton, Emilio Pagán, and Devin Williams have all signed within the last 10 days or so -- and several teams have been linked to Fairbanks. Signs point to him signing fairly soon.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 4 Texas Tech and No. 11 BYU meet Saturday in the Big 12 Championship Game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The matchup is the first appearance for both teams in the Big 12 title game, and neither has won a major conference title since the Big 12 was formed in 1996. The Red Raiders are in the midst of perhaps the greatest season in program history, and have virtually clinched their spot in the College Football Playoff. BYU needs a little more help after coming into the weekend as the projected first team out. To comfortably make the field for the first time, the Cougars likely have to win and earn the Big 12's automatic spot. The title game is a rematch, which played on Nov. 8 in Lubbock. The Red Raiders ran away with a 29-7 victory over the Cougars, the only loss by BYU this season. Running back Cameron Dickey rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown to lead the way.   Texas Tech vs. BYU: Need to know  Stunning defense: Texas Tech rates near the top of every Big 12 category, but the defense is one for the ages. Linebacker Jacob Rodriguez and edge rusher David Bailey both rank near the top of national defensive player of the year lists as the Red Raiders lead the nation in rushing defense. Rodriguez specifically has been ultra productive, leading the nation with seven forced fumbles and adding four interceptions. Dynamic rusher: BYU running back LJ Martin was a breakout candidate heading into 2025, but his rise has been off the charts. The junior from El Paso has rushed for 1,229 yards and 11 touchdowns on 5.7 yards per carry. In a 26-14 win against Cincinnati, Martin broke off 222 yards and two touchdowns. He struggled with injuries during the first matchup against Texas Tech, but is a major factor if fully healthy. \nImportant showcase: The College Football Playoff Committee has often cited BYU's loss to Texas Tech as a primary reason that the Cougars are sitting outside of the CFP. The Red Raiders were dominant in victory, holding BYU scoreless until late in the fourth quarter. BYU has the opportunity to make things right with a strong performance against Texas Tech. It's vital they rectify that performance.   Where to watch Texas Tech vs. BYU live  Date: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: AT&T Stadium -- Arlington, Texas  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Texas Tech vs. BYU prediction, picks  \nBYU played it safe during its first road trip to Lubbock. The Cougars didn't throw much until they trailed big, and didn't have a healthy LJ Martin. This time, expect plenty more motion and downfield passing after reviewing a full game of tape. However, it won't be enough. Texas Tech is the class of the Big 12 -- and maybe college football. They'll pull away in the fourth quarter for their first ever Big 12 title. Pick: Texas Tech -13.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

It's a rematch of last month's meeting, which Jacksonville State won 35-26.In Year 2 as an FBS member, Kennesaw State will be playing for its first CUSA title. The Owls finished the 2024 campaign at 2-10 and have staged a remarkable turnaround under first-year coach Jerry Mack. They enter the game 9-3 and went 7-1 in conference play.Jacksonville State also finished 7-1 in league play and will host the title game. The Gamecocks are seeking their second straight CUSA championship after beating Western Kentucky 52-12 in last year's title game. With a win over Kennesaw State, Jacksonville State would become the fourth program to claim back-to-back CUSA crowns. Kennesaw State vs. Jacksonville State: Need to know Homefield advantage for Jacksonville State: The Gamecocks have won 11 straight at home, with their last loss at AmFirst Stadium coming against Coastal Carolina in the 2024 season opener. This season's 5-0 home record includes their win over Kennesaw State. This will be the seventh all-time meeting between the programs, and the stakes have never been higher.Kennesaw State's turnaround: No FBS program has made a bigger leap in 2025 than Kennesaw State. The Owls improved their win total by seven and are on the verge of claiming a conference title in just their second season at the FBS level. They can become only the second program to win a league championship game in Year 2 after reclassifying from FCS -- joining Jacksonville State, which did it last year.\nCam Cook is the X-factor: Jacksonville State's star running back could determine this game. Cook enters averaging 131.8 rushing yards per game, the top mark in the FBS. He's totaled 1,581 yards, has topped 100 yards in seven straight games and has 10 100-yard performances overall — the most in the country. He ran for 132 yards and a touchdown in the first meeting with Kennesaw State.

The Gamecocks have home-field advantage and a strong run game that should help them control this one. My prediction is Jacksonville State wins the CUSA title game behind a big night on the ground from Cook. PICK: Jacksonville State -1.5 \n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        Don't overlook the Sun Belt Championship Game and the impact it could have on the College Football Playoff. No. 25 James Madison and Troy meet Friday night at Showker Field at Bridgeforth Stadium, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, with more than a conference crown on the line -- a victory for the Dukes could put them in position for an automatic CFP bid, depending on what happens Saturday in the ACC title game. For the Group of Six, this is a rare opportunity to get two teams into the 12-team playoff field.Then there's the added subplot for James Madison: coach Bob Chesney is set to take over at UCLA, sources confirmed to CBS Sports. While the timing of the move could be a distraction, Chesney's focus remains on guiding the Dukes toward their first conference championship since joining the FBS in 2022.Winners of the Sun Belt East Division, James Madison enters the title game 11-1, with its only loss coming at Louisville. Troy, meanwhile, finished 8-4 and captured the Sun Belt West Division, returning to the conference title game for the third time in four years. The Trojans won back-to-back Sun Belt championships in 2022 and 2023, giving them experience on the big stage.  James Madison vs. Troy: Need to know  CFP implications: This isn't a simple win-and-in scenario for James Madison. If Virginia defeats Duke in the ACC Championship Game, the Dukes won't make the playoff. And even if Duke pulls off the upset, there's no guarantee the selection committee won't still favor a five-loss ACC champion over what could be a 12-1 Sun Belt champion. The major knock on James Madison is its weak strength of schedule -- currently well outside the top 100 in the FBS -- which makes it harder for the committee to justify a spot over a Power Four champion with a tougher path.Matchup to watch: Troy's veteran linebacker Jordan Stringer (104 tackles, 11 for loss, 2.0 sacks) ranks 27th nationally in total stops and faces arguably the toughest test of his career against James Madison's dual-threat quarterback Alonza Barnett III (2,440 yards passing, 20 touchdowns; 459 yards rushing, 13 touchdowns) and 1,000-yard rusher Wayne Knight (1,051 rush yds, 8 touchdowns). Stringer will be in the middle of everything as Troy's defense -- 89th nationally at 4.46 yards allowed per rush -- tries to slow down a James Madison ground attack that ranks 15th in the FBS at 5.40 yards per carry.\nBalanced dominance: James Madison is one of four FBS teams that rank inside the top 10 nationally in both scoring offense and scoring defense. The Dukes average 37.8 points per game on offense and allow just 16.0 points per game on defense -- both 10th in the country. That balance has led to a dominant overall performance, ranking sixth in both point margin (+227) and spending the least amount of time trailing opponents all season (1:27:29).

The Dukes are a massive favorite over Troy, but they've blown the doors off essentially every Sun Belt opponent this season by an average of 27.38 points per game -- second-most by any FBS team in conference play. Coaching move distractions aside, James Madison should roll to its first Sun Belt title. Pick: James Madison -23.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n

    "body": "\n        The game of the year, so far at least, comes Saturday night in Indianapolis beaten undefeated No. 1 Ohio State and undefeated No. 2 Indiana for the Big Ten Championship.There may not be quite the playoff stakes of the Big 12 or SEC championship games as both Ohio State and Indiana are firmly in the projected bracket and currently expected to receive first-round byes. But there is still plenty at stake, including possibly the Heisman Trophy race, as college football's two best teams finally face off this season.  Ohio State, last year's national champion, comes to Indy with the nation's most-efficient passer (Julian Sayin), the best pair of receivers in the country (Jeremiah Smith, Carnell Tate) and a ferocious defense led by linebacker Arvell Reese and safety Caleb Downs. The Buckeyes have rarely been tested this season, but have looked every bit of the nation's top team so far.  Indiana, last year's surprise team, proved this season it was no one-season fluke. Cal transfer quarterback Fernando Mendoza has been terrific as one of the nation's best QBs. The Hoosiers' defense, orchestrated by defensive coordinator Bryant Haines, ranks top 3 in scoring defense, rushing defense and total defense. This is an even better and more well-rounded Indiana team than the one that went to the College Football Playoff a year ago.  \nYou'll want to stay up late Saturday night in what could be a preview of an eventual national championship matchup.   Ohio State vs. Indiana: Need to know Heisman stakes: Headed into the final weekend, Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza is tied with Vanderbilt QB Diego Pavia for the best Heisman odds while Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin is just behind at No. 3. With Pavia idle this championship weekend, the winning quarterback of the Big Ten championship will have a terrific opportunity to deliver a \"Heisman moment\" at a crucial time. Sayin and Mendoza both have great cases in what has been a wide-open Heisman race all season.  In Sayin's first year as the Buckeyes starter, he leads the nation in completion percentage (78.9), has thrown for 3,065 yards, 30 touchdowns and only six interceptions. Mendoza has been similarly impressive with 2,758 yards, 32 touchdowns and five interceptions. Watching these two guys go to work against top-flight defenses will be very fun to watch.  \nLongest winning streaks: The two teams with the longest regular-season winning streaks will meet in Indianapolis. Indiana won its last 13 regular-season games while Ohio State now has 12 consecutive wins after finally getting one over Michigan in its regular-season finale. When you add in postseason games (and the Buckeyes' title run last year), Ohio State has a nation's best 16 consecutive wins while Indiana checks in at No. 2 at 12 games. One other final stat for you: Ohio State, a 4.5-point favorite over the Hoosiers, has an impressive 10-1-1 record against the spread this season.  CFP implications: Neither Ohio State nor Indiana has to worry about missing the playoff no matter what happens in Indianapolis. The winner of this game will be locked into the No. 1 overall CFP seed and guaranteed a first-round bye. The bigger question would be whether the loser could fall out of the first-round bye territory of the top four seeds. Some of that will be dependent on what happens in the game, of course, and what the final margin ends up being. Assuming it's a relatively close game, however, the odds are that either Ohio State or Indiana would still be in terrific position to keep a bye. It's extremely unlikely, for instance, that No. 5 Oregon would jump either of these two teams, especially Indiana which has a head-to-head win over the Ducks in Eugene.   Where to watch Ohio State vs. Indiana live Date: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Time: 8 p.m. ET Location: Lucas Oil Stadium -- Indianapolis, Indiana  TV: Fox | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free) \n Ohio State vs. Indiana prediction, picks \nThe nation's two best teams finally meet on the field with a Big Ten Championship at stake. It's strength on strength here as Ohio State and Indiana both have explosive offenses and game-wrecking defenses. Both teams have been cruising and this will easily be each's toughest game so far. Will Heisman frontrunners Julian Sayin and Fernando Mendoza go to town? Or will the nation's top two defenses make this a low-scoring affair with neither able to get comfortable? It wouldn't be a surprise at all to see points being hard to come by early in this game, but ultimately I think it ends up being a bit more high-scoring than either defensive coordinator would prefer. Pick: Over 47.5 \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n

    "body": "\n        Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.                 We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.                  We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to sit Elic Ayomanor). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

Detroit might try to counter that with its run game, but Dallas' run defense has been pretty awesome since acquiring Quinnen Williams: 3.3 yards per carry, zero touchdowns, and a skimpy 2.8% explosive rush rate allowed. That should make you nervous about David Montgomery (6.3 carries per game in his past three), but nothing should keep you from starting Jahmyr Gibbs. I would expect a heavy workload for Jared Goff, which would normally be great, but he figures to be without Amon-Ra St. Brown. That still shouldn't keep him from finding around 24 Fantasy points, something 10 of 12 passers have done against Dallas this season, including 30-burgers to Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes in their past two games.

Jackson's completion rate has gone off the rails (under 59% in four straight), and his catchable pass rate has gone under 80% in each of his past two games. The combined lack of accuracy, along with his lack of rushing dominance, has made him a Fantasy liability. Is it a silver lining that he had one touchdown called back by a penalty and another fumbled out of the end zone by Isaiah Likely last week? Or is it a real problem that Jackson has officially not thrown a touchdown since Week 10? The Steelers have long played aggressive defense against Jackson and figure to do the same thing this week with a lot of man-to-man coverage and a lot of blitzing. Since his return from injury in Week 9, Jackson has completed 42.5% of his passes against man-to-man for 6.8 yards per attempt with an egregious 35% off-target throw rate; the completion and yardage rates get even worse when he's pressured. This is a tough spot to trust Jackson, especially since there's a real chance the Ravens can run their way to victory, given the state of the Steelers run defense, which might have a sub-100 percent Patrick Queen at linebacker and definitely won't have Derrick Harmon on the D-line.  \nMUST STARTS: Derrick Henry STARTS: Jaylen Warren (borderline No. 2/3 PPR RB), Ravens DST, Steelers DST FLEX: Kenneth Gainwell (low-end flex), DK Metcalf (low-end flex) SITS: Lamar Jackson (high-end No. 2 QB), Aaron Rodgers, Kenneth Gainwell (desperation RB), Calvin Austin III, Adam Thielen, Pat Freiermuth, Darnell Washington, Roman Wilson,  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nIn the Bills' blowout wins this season, Khalil Shakir's route participation rate has never been higher than 71.4% and as low as the 51.9% rate last week. That doesn't preclude him from being bad for Fantasy -- he had a 6-88-1 stat line Week 8 at Carolina -- but three of his four single-digit PPR point games did come in Bills blowout wins. This week doesn't feel like a blowout win for Buffalo, not after how the Bengals came out last Thursday and throttled the Ravens. But it does feel like a really good matchup for James Cook and thus a lesser need for Josh Allen to throw all over the place. It is worth noting that Shakir's metrics are much better against zone coverage than man-to-man, and the Bengals have been playing more man-to-man coverage over their past three games. Shakir remains flex-worthy, especially in PPR, but that's it.

Some of that is a function of the weak offenses they've played, some of it can be attributed to an emerging pass rush that's scored 12 sacks in their past three games, even without blitzing a ton. Indianapolis should aim to manage those pass rush issues, given its O-line and Daniel Jones' recent efforts to get the ball out faster over his past two games. If Jones could connect several times with Alec Pierce on downfield throws against Houston, then he should be able to do the same against Jacksonville, especially since Houston was as good as Jacksonville at defending deep throws going into last week. Pierce's upside is what makes him a must-start in Fantasy, while Jones is more of a low-end starter because he should be able to match or slightly exceed the 20 Fantasy points he's had in his past two games against tougher matchups.  \nJakobi Meyers has led the Jaguars in target per route run rate versus man coverage since joining the team four games ago. Before his arrival, that title belonged to Parker Washington. (Brian Thomas Jr. narrowly led with a 22.5% target per route run rate versus zone coverage.) If the Colts stick with playing a good dose of man-to-man coverage like they did last week, even after Sauce Gardner's injury, then Meyers should have a shot at a good game. Indy began the year playing a good amount of zone coverage, but altered course midseason and then traded for Gardner. Additionally, defensive boss Lou Anarumo leaned on a sizable amount of man-to-man coverage in two career meetings against Trevor Lawrence, beating him both times. This should encourage you to trust Meyers as at least a flex, especially if Parker Washington doesn't play.

McCarthy, Justin Jefferson has topped 15 PPR points once (Week 9) and 12 PPR points twice (Week 1), thanks to touchdowns he's caught. McCarthy is clearly problematic, but at least he knows to feed Jefferson the ball, given the receiver's 26.2% target per route run rate with McCarthy. Since Dan Quinn took over the playcalling duties for the Commanders defense, he's dialed up a lot of zone coverage and thus given up fewer deep completions. Because it looks like left tackle Christian Darrisaw is going to play, I'm willing to overlook other Vikings O-line deficiencies in what is otherwise a great matchup for them. If McCarthy focuses on making quick and easy decisions, then at least Jefferson should get good volume and be usable as a No. 2 receiver (just not a No. 1).  Why start Chris Rodriguez if he's a TD-or-bust running back? Simple: The Vikings have allowed at least one rushing touchdown to a running back in six straight games (six RBs and seven touchdowns total). Of the six RBs who scored, four had at least 12 carries; Rodriguez has 11 carries in three of his past four and has seemingly earned a role as the team's lead running-downs back. Start him as a touchdown-based flex or low-end RB, making him better in non-PPR than PPR formats.

They mostly fixed it in Week 13, putting Mitchell on the Fantasy radar against an evolving Dolphins defense that's rapidly improved against the run and is slowly improving against the pass. Their metrics against deep passes to WRs are awesome because they've barely been tested (50 targets of 15-plus air yards are the second-fewest any team has seen this year; they've allowed six scores on deep throws, though, bottom-10 in the league). Mitchell has eight targets of 15-plus air yards in his past two with Taylor. I'd be shocked if the Jets didn't try more of them, especially if they don't have much success stopping the Dolphins run game and are forced to throw. Plus, it's not like Mitchell doesn't get short targets either, catching 8 of 11 throws inside of 15 air yards in his past two games for 76 yards. It makes Mitchell a flex worth rolling the dice on.

Harvey era in Denver, and he's delivered two touchdowns, one run of eight-plus yards, zero runs of 12-plus yards, and nine runs of one or fewer yards. Thank goodness for the touchdowns ... and for the receiving skills (seven targets, six catches, 47 yards). Harvey had fewer hesitations in his runs last week than the week before, but dealt with a lot of bad blocking from his offensive line and still didn't win on outside runs. Despite it, I doubt Harvey is losing his grip on his share of the rushing workload. In Las Vegas' past two games against the Chargers and Browns, it has given up eight rushes of eight-plus yards (three went 20-plus yards) and four total touchdowns (three rushing) to RBs. Even if the Raiders give the Broncos a fight this week, there should be ample opportunities for Harvey to accumulate numbers, just maybe not with a lot of efficiency.\nA deep dive into Troy Franklin revealed that his best games and best production this season has come against defenses with a single-high safety on the field. Sure enough, Franklin's won a bunch against that coverage, frequently on intermediate comeback and in-breaking routes where his timing and experience with Bo Nix pay off. Last week the Commanders barely played that kind of coverage and the targets didn't go his way as a result. This week he'll see a Raiders defense that has played Cover-3 on 52.8% of their plays this season, the highest rate in the league (and they played it on 63.2% of their snaps against the Broncos in Week 10 when Franklin scored and totaled 15 PPR points). I'd try Franklin as a flex this week.MUST STARTS: Brock Bowers STARTS: R.J.

That's always been the name of the game with him: If a defense can't pressure him, they won't be able to stop him. This will be Chicago's biggest problem because, on the season, they're second-worst in pass rush pressure rate (29.5%) and they're eighth-lowest in sacks, including just two sacks in their past three games. Their lack of pass rush should open the door for Love to throw freely and deeply, creating opportunities for his receivers against a defense that does play a lot of man-to-man coverage in the second half of close games. I don't think we've seen the last of the Packers receivers having good numbers; Watson has a huge 33.3% target per route run rate against man-to-man coverage in the Packers' past four games (since Tucker Kraft got hurt). He's my favorite receiver of the four, but Romeo Doubs and Dontayvion Wicks should also see some looks.  The Bears' run game has become a staple of their winning recipe, but this is a tough matchup. In their past five games, excluding garbage time, the Packers have allowed 3.9 yards per carry and a 7.9% explosive rush rate. That's good, not dominant, but it's impressive that that's what they've let up considering they've seen 28-plus RB rush attempts in four of those five games. That's a lot of running. The Bears will stick with their ground game as long as possible to control the clock and take pressure off of Caleb Williams, but if their defense can't do what it did last week, that plan will go out the window and Williams will have to play Superman against a Packers defense that brings a lot of pass rush pressure every week without having to blitz. That's problematic for Williams, who is among the league's least efficient passers when pressured, complete with a 37.2% completion rate, 4.6 yards per attempt, and a poor 1.8% TD rate.

Houston did well against Mahomes through the air in two games last season, holding him to no more than 260 yards and only one passing touchdown in each meeting; a rushing TD saved his stat line last December. Lately, the Texans have had a mean streak up front, blitzing more recently in competitive games. That's been affecting quarterbacks; only three quarterbacks have more than 21 Fantasy points against them all year, and none have more than 23.9. Mahomes hasn't been great versus pressure in years, but the make-up of his offense should help him since those pesky Texans outside corners might not venture inside the numbers to deal with Rashee Rice of Travis Kelce, and that's who he's leaned on since Rice's return from suspension. Mahomes is also a candidate to scramble when pressured, just as he did in his games against the Texans last year. All of the Chiefs studs are Fantasy worthy, but this isn't a great matchup for Kareem Hunt (the Texans just did a nice job against Jonathan Taylor last week) or Xavier Worthy (he'll see those cornerbacks a lot and hasn't delivered a good stat line in nearly two months).   MUST-STARTS: Patrick Mahomes, Rashee Rice, Nico Collins, Travis Kelce STARTS: Dalton Schultz, Texans DST (borderline DST) FLEX: Jayden Higgins, Kareem Hunt SITS: C.J.

Was the Chargers offensive line better coming out of the bye? Sort of -- they weren't great blocking up runs (even the long Vidal touchdown had some mistakes) and they wore down against the pass rush as the game went on. Going from the Raiders front to the Eagles front is a big step-up in class, especially if the Eagles get their act together versus the run after an embarrassing effort last week versus the Bears. We've seen bad play from the Chargers O-line before and it's led to weak stats from most everyone involved. As up-and-down as Philly has been defensively, they deserve the benefit of the doubt in this matchup. It could mean more weak numbers from many Chargers players.  MUST-STARTS: Patrick Mahomes, Rashee Rice, Nico Collins, Travis Kelce STARTS: Dalton Schultz, Texans DST (borderline DST) FLEX: Jayden Higgins, Kareem Hunt SITS: C.J.

    "body": "\n        You wouldn't think the Super Bowl race could get any more wide open than it already was … then Week 15 happened.The Chiefs and Bengals were both eliminated, meaning the AFC won't have to go through Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow. That was looking like a formality but I'm sure the rest of the conference is still relieved and believing that anyone can make the Super Bowl now.Then, just when it looked like two teams (Rams and Packers) were starting to separate themselves in the NFC, they lose two of their star players. Micah Parsons' season is over with a torn ACL, while Davante Adams aggravated a hamstring injury that puts his status in doubt for a crucial matchup vs. the Seahawks on Thursday that could ultimately decide the No. 1 seed in the NFC.Rams still the favorite, but NFC just got really interestingI still like the Rams to win the NFC but if anything was going to throw them off it'd be an injury to one of their stars on offense. Adams' injury doesn't look to be season ending and he was optimistic after the game, but the severity is still unknown. Even missing one game could be detrimental to the Rams' Super Bowl hopes, and it's hard to imagine him being ready on a short week after how he went down on Sunday. \nThe Rams face the Seahawks on Thursday in Seattle and the winner of that game will be in the driver's seat for the top seed in the NFC. The Rams may have beaten the Seahawks earlier this season, but Adams scored a touchdown in that game and they only won by two despite Sam Darnold's horrific four-interception performance.Adams may not be a WR1 anymore but he's helped elevate Matthew Stafford to an MVP level and he's been a major nightmare for opposing defenses in the red zone. The Rams lead the NFL in offensive efficiency (+8.4 offensive EPA per game) and are third in the NFL in red zone touchdown percentage this season (67%) after ranking 13th and 25th, respectively, in those categories last season.Adams deserves a lot of credit. He has 11 touchdown catches since Week 7, and nine of them have been on plays inside the opponent's five yard line. He's caught nine of 12 targets for nine touchdowns inside the five in that span. Somehow Stafford to Adams has become as reliable as the Tush Push in short-yardage spots. No other NFL player has more than four catches in that area since Week 7. \nWith Stafford's ball placement and Adam's combination of size and footwork he's helped the Rams cash in on their scoring opportunities. He put Riq Woolen on skates with this slant route for a 1-yard score vs. Seattle earlier this year. \nHe caught a fade here vs. the Buccaneers. Adams' nine touchdowns in goal-to-go situations are only surpassed by one other player since 2000. It was Adams in 2020 when he had 12.\nWhile Adams could miss an extended period of time and the injury is obviously not ideal, there's several reasons to believe they could weather the storm. The Rams beat the Jaguars 35-7 in Week 7, their only game without Puka Nacua this season. They are extremely balanced and the only team that ranks top five in the NFL in offensive and defensive efficiency. \nThe Rams have used 13 personnel (one running, three tight ends) more than twice as much as any other team in the NFL since Nacua was hurt in Week 7 (41%). The recent switch to this personnel is another reason to believe they can manage without Adams for now. The Rams are averaging an NFL-high 35.0 PPG since they started using this heavy personnel in Week 7. They are still averaging a ridiculous 6.3 yards per play in those groups. They rank second in the NFL pass success rate (63%) and rush success rate (50%) vs. base defenses in that span so that personnel is allowing Stafford to pick apart mismatches while they are still running the ball effectively.The Rams run game looks poised to carry more of that burden, too. They rank top four in the NFL in rushing (186.7 yards per game) and yards per rush (6.5) in the past three weeks with the emergence of Blake Corum in the backfield with Kyren Williams. They are the only duo in at least the last 90 seasons with 70+ rushing yards and a rushing touchdown a piece in three straight games.Of course, the door is more open for almost everyone else in the NFC should this slow the Rams down. The Seahawks are the biggest beneficiary. They control their own destiny in the NFC and they'll take any edge they can get when they host the Rams in three days. \nThe Eagles, Bears and 49ers have to feel like they have a chance, too. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 overreactions: Micah Parsons injury ends Packers' Super Bowl hopes? Josh Allen for MVP?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nParsons injury crushes Packers' Super Bowl hopes; NFC North up for grabsThose teams all benefit from the Packers' misfortune, too. I would argue they were the second best team in the NFC, until they weren't. Everything was looking up for the Packers midway through Sunday's game until all of the air came out of the balloon and a potential dream season turned to a nightmare. The Packers were up 23-14 in the third quarter when Jordan Love's interception cost Green Bay the ball and his top weapon as Christian Watson left the game with a chest injury and did not return. Later in the quarter Parsons suffered his season-ending torn ACL. The Packers got dominated the rest of the way and fell from the No. 2 seed to the No. 7 seed in the NFC. They were on the verge of beating a playoff-caliber team in three straight games (Lions, Bears, Broncos) and looking like they had as good of a case as anyone to win Super Bowl LX. Now, Green Bay looks destined to go one-and-done again. This was a team that was 0-7 vs. 11+ win teams in 2024 when they did not have Parsons. They made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history and traded two first-round picks for the generational talent to put them over the top in the postseason and in games like Sunday's. Then, in the blink of an eye, those hopes evaporated. You could argue they could bounce back from this. The 49ers have grinded out wins without Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, after all. That's also a highly motivated team coming off a Super Bowl hangover season with an easy schedule. The 49ers have also gone from 13th to last in the NFL in pressure rate since Bosa's injury. I don't see how the Packers rebound from this crushing loss in the stretch run of the season.\nThat's the task though and they'll barely have time to lick their wounds as they play the Bears at Soldier Field on Saturday night with the NFC North on the line. The Bears now have the edge in the division given these injuries and how they just played the Packers in Green Bay. Parsons may have gotten off a slow start with the Packers after his contract dispute with Dallas and a back injury this offseason but he was still having a dominant season. He became the first player in NFL history with 12+ sacks in each of his first five seasons. He ranks second in the NFL in pressure rate this year (20%)  and he led the NFL in that category since Week 10 (23%), which included a game with seven pressures vs. the Bears in Week 14. His absence could help put Chicago over the top. Caleb Williams has the lowest completion percentage (38%) in the NFL vs. pressure this season. Just as the Cowboys defense has struggled all season without Parsons, it's hard to imagine Green Bay won't take a step back here, too. Don't overlook Watson's injury, either. The Packers reportedly got some good news on his injury but it's unclear whether he will miss time. His reemergence elevated Green Bay to a top-flight offense as he ranked sixth in the NFL in yards per route (2.64) in the past five weeks behind Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, CeeDee Lamb, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Nico Collins (minimum 100 routes). He's added an element of explosiveness back into the passing game evidenced by two touchdowns vs. the Bears in Week 14. All of a sudden, Green Bay could be without two of its most important players in a game that will probably decide the division in Week 16.The 49ers have a path to the one seed in the NFCThe biggest winner in the NFC besides the Seahawks is the 49ers. Besides finally having another NFC contender share in their injury misery, San Francisco's surprising path to the top seed in the NFC just got intriguing. The 49ers are 10-4 and will be the top seed in the conference if they win out and the Seahawks beat the Rams on Thursday.\nThe 49ers final three games are at the Colts and then at home vs. the Bears and Seahawks. If they win out they'll finish the year 13-4 with a 5-1 division record, including 3-1 vs. the Rams and Seahawks. That would give them any tiebreaker over their NFC West rivals if Seattle beats Los Angeles on Thursday. A 49ers win in Week 16 vs. the Bears would also mean no other NFC team can get to 13 wins.The 49ers have been flying under the radar all season as they've played the second-easiest schedule in the NFC (only the Bears is easier). I've written them of myself after Brock Purdy threw three interceptions on Monday night vs. the Panthers. Especially since they already have a defense that's last in the NFL in sacks and without Bosa and Warner. But, this is a very well coached team with Robert Saleh back in the fold and Christian McCaffrey is having a spectacular season. If they can beat the odds and steal the top seed after Rams and Packers losses, who's to say they couldn't ride home-field advantage to Super Bowl LX, which will be at their home stadium. That would be an incredible story that went from impossible to improbable after these injuries. There's also speculation that Warner could be aiming to make a return should the 49ers make a deep playoff run, although that still seems unlikely.\nAdd to the list of many intriguing storylines in a wide-open Super Bowl race that just got even more interesting among NFC contenders of injuries to superstars around the league.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe last chance to join NFL DFS contests for Week 15 comes on 'Monday Night Football' when the Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins at 8:15 p.m. ET. While those in the passing game like Aaron Rodgers, Tua Tagovailoa, D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Waddle, who is a late add to the injury list as questionable with an illness, will garner lots of interest as NFL DFS picks, both teams rank in the bottom 10 in pass offense. Thus, if you still want to utilize pass catchers from the MNF DFS player pool, perhaps, it would be a better daily Fantasy football strategy to target lower cost receivers as they would be less risky options.Miami tight end Greg Dulcich is averaging 30.8 receiving yards over his last five games, while Pittsburgh's Darnell Washington is averaging 36.5 yards over his last four. It may not be the worst NFL DFS advice to roster them instead of spending up on the likes of Darren Waller or Jonnu Smith. Before making any Dolphins vs. Steelers DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Monday Night Football', be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. \nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Dolphins vs. SteelersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Waddle. The fifth-year receiver has upped his production since Tyreek Hill was injured as he's averaged over 70 total yards since Week 5. Waddle had 50 receiving yards, 21 rushing yards and a touchdown a week ago and now gets to face a porous secondary in Pittsburgh. The Steelers have allowed the most catches of any team to opposing wideouts while giving up the second-most receiving yards to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Waddle to go Over 63.5 receiving yards at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Steelers running back Kenneth Gainwell. The former Eagle has become a bigger part of Pittsburgh's offense as of late, averaging 12.3 touches over his last four, after averaging just 5.3 touches over his prior four games. He might see even more work in this one if Warren's illness keeps him out or limits him. Gainwell's made the most of these opportunities as he ranks as the RB9 in Fantasy over the last four weeks. Meanwhile, Miami has the No. 25 run defense, and just four teams are allowing more yards per carry than the Dolphins. Thus, Gainwell has the potential to supply lots of value to your MNF DFS lineups and he won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Gainwell to go Over 28.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Steelers vs. Dolphins DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        Philip Rivers came out of retirement to help the Indianapolis Colts reach the postseason, and he held his own in the 18-16 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. While CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported that Anthony Richardson is medically cleared to return to the field, the Colts will not make a change at quarterback.Coach Shane Steichen told reporters that Rivers will start again on Monday night, when the Colts host Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers in prime time. The 44-year-old grandfather gets another shot under center. Rivers completed 18 of 27 passes for 120 yards Sunday with one touchdown and one interception. It marked Rivers' fewest passing yards since 2009, but it had been 1,800 days since he last played in an NFL game. All things considered, it was not a bad outing. \"Very encouraged, there's no question about it,\" Steichen said of Rivers' play after the game, via the Colts' official website. \"For him to go out there and do what he did after five years off, to have a chance to win it, get a game-winning field goal -- close to it -- with 40 seconds left in a hostile environment against a top defense. Just shows his commitment to coming back and playing the way he did and fighting like crazy for his teammates. I thought that was pretty awesome.\"Rivers came in, not to push the ball down the field and create explosive plays, but to run the offense and be consistent from the pocket. He did just that on Sunday. Rivers didn't have too many misfires, and more importantly did not make any horrific errors. \n\"This isn't the motivation, but I do think that maybe there will be -- I think about my own boys, my own two sons, but certainly the high school team I'm coaching, but this isn't why I'm doing it,\" Rivers said in his postgame press conference. \"I know it comes with it and I know it is a story and I know it is rare and all those things, but I didn't do that. I was enjoying myself down there being coach in south Alabama.\"Obviously this doesn't come up every day. But I think maybe it will inspire or teach not to be run or be scared of what may or may not happen. Hopefully, certainly I think of my sons and those ballplayers that I'm in charge of at the school, that they'll say crap, coach wasn't scared. Like, shoot, sometimes there is doubt and it's real, and again, the guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is shoot, we'll see what happens. And so yeah, I hope in that sense it can be a positive to some young boys or young people, doesn't have to be boys. But again, that's not the motivation. But whatever God's will, I'm happy with.\"It will be interesting to see how Rivers looks with another week of preparation. The Colts' running backs predictably were a major part of the offensive game plan, as Jonathan Taylor rushed 25 times for 87 yards, while Ameer Abdullah led the Colts with five catches for 32 yards. \nThe 10-4 49ers represent another tough test for Indy as winners of four straight games, and in the hunt for the No. 1 seed. As for the Colts, they have a 13.8% chance to rebound and make the playoffs, according to SportsLine's projections. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Winter Meetings are well in the rearview mirror by now and plenty of things still need to happen in the MLB offseason. Let's gather the comings and goings of the day right here. Dodgers told Glasnow he won't be tradedA rumor coming out of the Winter Meetings was that the Dodgers were dangling starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow in trade talks. There are still two years and $65 million left on Glasnow's deal before a $30 million club option in 2028, and while he's been good while healthy, he has never pitched more than 135 innings in a single season (his career high came in 2024 with the Dodgers, his first season after being traded to Los Angeles).Glasnow, though, said on MLB Network Radio that the Dodgers' front office told him he won't be traded. He said he trusts them.Obviously plans can change, but it doesn't seem like the Dodgers front office would go out of their way to tell Glasnow he's not going anywhere if they were planning to trade him. \nMets looking for frontline starting pitching, also a batThe Mets \"still want to add a starter for somewhere in the front half of their rotation,\" according to The Athletic, and are also \"eyeing another bat.\" The report says it would be surprising if the Mets didn't add to their outfield, particularly after Brandon Nimmo was traded away. Further, they are open to trading Ronny Mauricio, Luisangel Acuña and/or Mark Vientos. The rotation right now has Nolan McLean, David Peterson, Kodai Senga, Clay Holmes and Sean Manaea with depth options Jonah Tong and Brandon Sproat. Perhaps McLean grows into an ace while Peterson and Senga have shown the ability to pitch like All-Stars at times, but there isn't a true ace here right now. Hence the Mets interest in grabbing a frontline guy from outside the organization.In terms of adding to the outfield, right field is locked up with Juan Soto and Jeff McNeil is penciled into left, but he can move around. Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said earlier this winter that top prospect Carson Benge will get a chance to win the starting center field job out of spring training, but he has yet to even make his major-league debut. They've been connected in trade rumors with Luis Robert Jr. since at least the 2025 trade deadline.\nPhillies sign GarcíaThe Phillies have agreed to a one-year, $10 million deal with outfielder Adolis García, per The Athletic. The 32 year old has had quite a fall in the last two years. In 2023, he was an All-Star and Gold Glover and one of the best players on the World Series champion Rangers, slashing .245/.328/.508 (127 OPS+) with 39 homers, 107 RBI and 4.5 WAR. He was non-tendered by the Rangers this offseason after hitting .227/.271/.394. The Phillies will be hoping that this lottery ticket cashes with García bouncing back and looking like the 2023 version of himself.Also, the Phillies have been rumored to be looking to trade right fielder Nick Castellanos and this move sure seems like it's coverage for such a reality. García hits perfectly in that spot.\nRoyals eyeing DuranThe Royals needed basically an entire outfield as they headed into the offseason. They have traded for Isaac Collins and signed free agent Lane Thomas, but it still certainly isn't a strength. They are reportedly open to trading for another outfielder and have their eyes on Red Sox All-Star outfielder Jarren Duran, per The Athletic. Duran, 29, hit .256/.332/.442 (114 OPS+) with 41 doubles, 13 triples, 16 home runs, 84 RBI, 86 runs, 24 steals and 4.7 WAR last season.Interestingly, the report notes that a Duran move could cost the Royals left-handed starter Cole Ragans. After an All-Star season in 2024, injuries ruined the 2025 season for Ragans, but he still has the upside of an ace. \nFurther, the Royals also have interest in Cardinals utility man Brendan Donovan. Ketel Marte's no-trade listDiamondbacks All-Star second baseman Ketel Marte's name remains in the trade rumor mill. He's still got $102.5 million over the next six years on his contract, but he's good enough to make that a bargain. There have reportedly been clubhouse issues, of course, which makes things a bit more murky.Further complicating matters might be his no-trade clause. There are five teams on it, according to The Athletic: the Athletics, Pirates, Yankees, Giants and Cardinals.\nBell signs with TwinsThe Twins have agreed to a one-year deal with first baseman Josh Bell, reports ESPN. The deal is for a guaranteed $7 million, per the Minnesota Star-Tribune.Bell, a 33-year-old switch-hitter, slashed .237/.325/.417 (110 OPS+) with 22 home runs, 63 RBI and 0.4 WAR in 140 games for the Nationals last season. The Twins appear to be headed toward a bit of a rebuild, but reports have also indicated they are hanging on to outfielder Byron Buxton along with starting pitchers Pablo López and Joe Ryan. Much like with Glasnow and the Dodgers, though, things can change quickly.\nMets sign PacheThe Mets and outfielder Christian Pache have agreed to a deal, according to the New York Post. This is a depth signing. Pache didn't play in the majors in 2025 after posting -0.2 WAR with three different teams in 2024. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The sixth AP Top 25 poll of the 2025-26 season released, and the top of the rankings remained generally unchanged. After jumping to No. 1 last week over Michigan and Duke, Arizona held firm at the top spot and received 42 first-place votes. The Wildcats added to one of the best résumés in the country by defeating Alabama 96-75. Arizona boasts five ranked wins: Florida, UCLA, UConn, Alabama and Auburn. Michigan received the second-most first-place votes (15) after defeating Villanova and Maryland. Duke, another team that challenged for the No. 1 spot, was idle. Speaking of the Big Ten, one of the best stories in the sport is brewing. Nebraska jumped eight spots to No. 15 after pulling off a dramatic 83-80 win over Illinois on the road after Jamarques Lawrence knocked down a 3-pointer with 0.2 seconds remaining. The Cornhuskers are 11-0 for the first time in program history, including a 2-0 start in Big Ten play. Nebraska is one of five teams from the Big Ten which opened the season 2-0 in conference play. Nebraska earned its highest ranking since 1991. \n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Top-ranked Michigan, No. 2 Arizona may stay in respective slots for a while\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nReigning national champion Florida dropped five spots to No. 23 after falling to UConn.

Voters still favor Arizona at No. 1 It's not a surprise that Arizona held firm at No. 1 this week. The Wildcats recorded a statement win against Alabama and have one of the best résumés in college basketball. Although Michigan recorded a blowout win over Villanova and a victory over Maryland in Big Ten play, it wasn't enough to swing the voters this week. Truthfully, Arizona will likely hold on to the No. 1 spot until when/if it loses. Michigan's next big game is against USC on Jan. 2. Duke was idle this week. However, the Blue Devils have a key matchup against Texas Tech this weekend. \n Welcome to the poll, Georgia For the first time this season, Georgia has entered the poll. The Bulldogs checked in at No. 25 after improving to 9-1 with a win over Cincinnati last week. Georgia's lone loss this season came against Clemson in a 97-94 thriller. Since that loss, the Bulldogs have won three consecutive games. Last season, Georgia was ranked once in the AP poll. The next test for the Bulldogs will come against Auburn on Jan. 3 in their SEC opener. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers have to finish out the 2025 season without their most important defensive player, as star pass rusher Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL during their Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos, according to NFL Media. He reportedly faces a nine-month recovery, at least. Parsons posted a message on social media, calling his injury \"my greatest test,\" and saying he will rise again.\"I may be sidelined, but I am not defeated. This injury is my greatest test—a moment God allowed to strengthen my testimony. I believe He walks with me through this storm and chose me for this fight because He knew my heart could carry it. I'm deeply grateful to the Packers organization and my teammates for their unwavering support, love, and belief in me during this season. I trust His timing, His plan, and His purpose. I will rise again.\"The injury occurred during a first-and-10 in the third quarter, when Parsons fought his way to Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, but planted awkwardly with his left leg. He immediately went down holding his knee. \nParsons remained on the turf for several moments as he was attended to by trainers. Players from both teams took knees around the star pass rusher -- who was eventually got up and walked to the locker room with the medical staff. \nParsons' recovery timeline could carry deep into the offseason and threaten his availability for the 2026 opener. While ACL recoveries generally take 6-8 months, CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo says that Parsons' explosiveness as an edge rusher could force him to ease back into action more slowly than if he played a different position.\n\"When you have that kind of speed, that talent that he was born with … that's going to delay the rehab just a little bit,\" Jaramillo said on CBS Sports HQ. \"Once we get the ACL healed and he strengthens his entire body and he's ready to start running, then we start adding change of direction. The constant cutting in all directions with also stop-go acceleration, that's the real window. We're going to look at him in possibly 8-10 months for an athlete at that position, someone as explosive as Micah Parsons.\"Entering Sunday, Parsons recorded 39 tackles, 12.5 sacks, 26 QB hits and a forced fumble. He became the first player since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to begin a career with five seasons of at least 12 sacks.The Packers, of course, acquired Parsons from the Dallas Cowboys just weeks before the season started in exchange for defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks. Once the trade was official, Green Bay gave Parsons the contract extension he was seeking -- a four-year, $188 million deal. \nParsons was regarded by the franchise as an X-factor for a potential Super Bowl run, but now, Green Bay will have to move forward without its sack leader.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola plans to enter the transfer portal when it opens on January 2, sources told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Husker fans have been bracing for Raiola's possible departure for weeks. Raiola's brother, Dayton, decommitted from the Huskers at the end of November and Matt Rhule fired offensive line coach Donovan Raiola, Dylan's uncle, shortly after the season ended. Raiola was once a 5-star prospect coming out of high school, and in his time at Nebraska there were glimpses of the brilliant talent that earned him that rating. However, the consistency in production never quite matched up, and now we'll see how he's viewed around the country as he looks to find a new team for his junior season. Raiola was a starter at Nebraska from Day 1 as a true freshman, and in his two years in Lincoln he's started 22 games, completing 69.1% of his passes for 4,819 yards, 31 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. In nine games played in 2025 before suffering a season-ending broken fibula, Raiola showed improvement as a passer, bumping his completion percentage up to 72.4% and cutting down on turnovers with just six interceptions after 11 as a freshman. \nNow he will explore his options and figures to be among the most coveted quarterbacks on the transfer market, which will include other big names like Florida's DJ Lagway, Michigan State's Aidan Chiles, ECU's Katin Houser and Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby, who all indicated their intention to enter the portal on Monday as well.Raiola figures to be looking for somewhere he can raise his profile and seeking a supporting cast around him to help showcase his full talents on a contender. According to Chris Hummer, Oregon is a school expected to show interest in Raiola, which would certainly fit the bill as a place where he can contend and play with a strong supporting cast on offense. The Ducks will likely see Dante Moore head off to the NFL whenever their College Football Playoff run concludes, and Dan Lanning could bring Raiola in as the new starter in Eugene to try and keep Oregon rolling right along. \nRaiola would be a different archetype than we've seen in Lanning's tenure at Oregon. Bo Nix, Dillon Gabriel and Dante Moore have all had slighter frames but were tremendously accurate, allowing the Ducks to stay on schedule and get their playmakers the ball on time and in space. Raiola showed growth in that area with his jump in completion percentage this year at Nebraska, but he also possesses a big frame and strong arm that could provide Oregon with a different dynamic attacking down the field. We'll find out in January whether the Ducks do in fact end up landing Raiola or if he finds a different landing spot, but he figures to be among the most coveted targets for teams in need of a new starter. Nebraska, meanwhile, will have to shift their focus to finding a new quarterback after the Raiola era produced back-to-back 7-win seasons, but the Huskers never quite hit the heights they hoped to when he flipped to Rhule's program from being committed to Georgia. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With Alabama's Kalen DeBoer seemingly taking himself out of Michigan's coaching search, the Wolverines trudge forward since the firing of Sherrone Moore with other options in mind, including Arizona State's Kenny Dillingham and Missouri's Eli Drinkwitz.The Associated Press reported Sunday through sources that the search firm hired by Michigan to help find Moore's replacement has reached out to representatives for Drinkwitz and Dillingham in recent days, two coaches who have been connected to various other openings this cycle.247Sports confirmed the AP's report that Michigan has contacted Drinkwitz's representation, and he is considered a target for the Wolverines, along with Washington's Jedd Fisch and even DeBoer despite his public comments ahead of this weekend's College Football Playoff. Michigan is \"casting a wide net\" given the timing of the opening, The Michigan Insider's Alejandro Zuniga told CBS Sports this week. Drinkwitz, who is repped by Clint Dowdle after a split from Jimmy Sexton, agreed to a contract extension with the Tigers in November that pushes his average annual salary past $10.7 million.\n\"Drinkwitz recently signed an extension, but his buyout ($5 million) remains manageable from Michigan's perspective,\" Zuniga said. \"If the courtship with Drinkwitz continues, it may need to involve some relationship mending after he poked fun at Michigan for the Connor Stalions saga in December 2023.\" Drinkwitz's contract announcement came after his name was associated with the Florida and Auburn vacancies last month and just before Penn State hired Matt Campbell as its new coach.\"During the first round (of the coaching carousel) when his name was tied to basically every open job, the feeling locally was always that he was going to stay,\" Power Mizzou's Gabe DeArmond told CBS Sports on Monday. \"Fully understand signing the extension doesn't make it impossible for him to leave, but the optics would be far worse than they would have been three weeks ago. It seems very unlikely to me.\"\nDrinkwitz and the Tigers started 5-0 this season but lost four of their final seven games to finish 8-4. Before a loss at Oklahoma on Nov. 22, Drinkwitz addressed job rumors. He has not spoken publicly about being attached to any openings since.\"You know, I'm not going to comment on message board chatter, tweets, sources. I've maintained with you and our team that my complete focus is on the task at hand,\" Drinkwitz said. \"You know, last week, people were tired of me because I couldn't win the big game. People had me meeting with my team and telling them that I was going to another school, none of which were true. \"Now, this week, it's a different story, because we scored the second most points in the SEC this year at 49 (against Missisippi State). So you know, all of this stuff is just a distraction. You know, I would like to remind everybody, including our fans, we absolutely love Mizzou. We love what we're building. We've been to six straight bowl games. We got the sellout streak going. Our administration has been nothing but phenomenal to me.\"\nDrinkwitz won 11 games at Missouri in 2023 and beat Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl prior to last season's 10-3 finish. He's 46-28 overall in six years, including a 26-24 mark in SEC play. The SEC's 2023 Coach of the Year, Drinkwitz trails only Kirby Smart, Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian for most overall wins in the conference over the last three years.It should come as no surprise that Drinkwitz bubbled up in Michigan's search process given his penchant for recruiting and finding gems in the transfer portal. He's never had the SEC's most-talented roster but finished with 11 wins in 2023 and 10 last fall resulting in Missouri's first consecutive top-20 finishes since Gary Pinkel's tenure (2013-14).With greater NIL influence and resources than Missouri, Michigan signed a top-10 class in 2025 headlined by five-star quarterback Bryce Underwood, the top-ranked player in the country.\nDillingham's situation with Sun DevilsDillingham is close to signing an extension with Arizona State, but that hasn't happened yet, per 247Sports. Dillingham confirmed after practice Saturday that Arizona State and his agent began working on contract amendments shortly after the conclusion of the regular season. Dillingham later acknowledged he has not spoken with Michigan or any other programs regarding coaching vacancies and is focused on his Sun Devils' upcoming bowl game against ACC champion Duke on Dec. 31. Dillingham said it was \"cool, I guess\" to be wanted by a prestigious program like Michigan.\"That doesn't change how I feel about here,\" Dillingham said over the weekend. \"That doesn't change that my sister's my neighbor, that doesn't change that my parents live three doors down, that doesn't change that my son's best friend is my sister's daughter. None of that changes, but it is one of the best jobs in America. It's an unbelievable brand, iconic brand and it's a great opportunity for somebody.\"\nDillingham, 35, won the Big 12's Coach of the Year honor last fall after leading the Sun Devils to a league title and the program's first playoff berth. He's 22-16 overall across three seasons at Arizona State and like Drinkwitz, has spoken publicly about the need for enhanced NIL efforts at his current program.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer reiterated a previous point Monday that he stands committed to the Crimson Tide, stiff-arming speculation concerning the Michigan vacancy ahead of a College Football Playoff bout with Oklahoma. Deboer, widely-considered among the best fits for the Wolverines soon after Sherrone Moore's firing further commented on job speculation Monday morning.\"I put a statement out yesterday because I just … first of all, our guys handle distractions phenomenally,\" DeBoer said. \"It's been that way all season long. They continue to do that. But I also knew yesterday and today was pretty important. I wasn't going to see (media) until today to address it, so that's why I put that out there. Lot of the same things I said before a couple weeks ago when I was asked the same question. \"Just feel complete supported. My family loves living here. All the things we continue to build on. Love the progress. Haven't talked with anyone. No plans of talking with anyone. I think that's a lot of what I said a couple weeks ago and it continues to be the same thing. Our guys, if there's been any distraction, I haven't seen it. Haven't felt it. We've probably all-season long have dealt with enough noise where it doesn't surprise me on how they've handled this.\"In his second season with the Crimson Tide after taking Washington to the 2023 national championship game, DeBoer is 19-7 at Alabama, which faces Oklahoma in the first round of the College Football Playoff on Friday night.\n\"We are proud to have Coach DeBoer leading our football program at The University of Alabama,\" Crimson Tide athletic director Greg Byrne said in Sunday's previous statement. \"He is an incredible coach and does an excellent job with the development of our student-athletes, both on and off the field. Just as he is committed to this team, we are committed to him, and we look forward to taking the field Friday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\"DeBoer's statement came after Ryan Williams and other players mentioned rumors on social media being difficult to avoid.\"Yeah, of course we see it on TV, but I mean, he's gave his best effort here,\" Williams said Friday. \"Focused on playing against Oklahoma, we're not really worried about it. ... I mean, at the end of the day, he serves us 100% and that's our coach, so we're going to play for him. External noise is external noise, so we just focus on the internal.\"\nThis isn't the first job opening this cycle where DeBoer's name immediately emerged. DeBoer denied previous speculation about the Penn State vacancy prior to the Nittany Lions' hiring of Matt Campbell, but had not addressed the Michigan situation until Sunday.DeBoer and the Crimson Tide's chief focus can now be on the Sooners after a previous loss to Oklahoma last month put Alabama in several playoff elimination games down the stretch. The Crimson Tide suffered three giveaways during that 23-21 setback in Tuscaloosa despite doubling Oklahoma in total yardage and largely dominating the contest.The Alabama-Oklahoma winner plays unbeaten and top-seeded Indiana at the Rose Bowl in the quarterfinals.\n            ",

The Packers also saw wideout Christian Watson go down with a chest or shoulder injury during the Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos, but it appears he will be OK.Watson avoided major injury, but it is unclear if he will miss any time, NFL Media reports. Watson, who caught three passes for 29 yards before exiting the matchup, suffered an injury in the third quarter while attempting to haul in a deep pass from Jordan Love. \nWatson entered Week 15 on a heater, having caught five touchdowns in the last four games. That includes a season-best performance in the Week 14 win against the Chicago Bears, where Watson caught all four of his targets for 89 yards and two touchdowns. In all, Watson caught 28 passes for 481 yards and five scores this year. The Packers offense struggled in crunch time in Denver, scoring just three points on their final six drives after racking up 23 points on the first five possessions. The play in which Watson was injured was the turning point, as the Broncos went on to out-score the Packers, 20-3, following Patrick Surtain II's interception. \nThe loss of Parsons is a massive one for the Packers defense, but it appears the offense avoided catastrophe on the Watson front. With the loss to the Broncos, the Packers fell from the No. 2 seed in the NFC to the No. 7 seed. Up next for Green Bay is a rematch with the Bears in Chicago on Saturday night. The Packers have a 47.7% chance to win the NFC North, but an 89% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine projections. \n            \n    ",

The first team is headlined by four Ohio State Buckeyes -- Caleb Downs, Jeremiah Smith, Arvell Reese and Kayden McDonald. Downs is the only player in the country to make the first team in 2024 and 2025. In total, 10 Big Ten players earned first-team honors, leading all conferences -- the SEC was second with six, ahead of the Big 12 (3) and Independents (3). Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza took the first-team quarterback spot over Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia, who earned a second-team nod. Mendoza is one of six Hoosiers to earn an All-America spot, as Indiana enjoyed its best regular season in program history. Texas Tech is another school putting together one of its greatest seasons, and the Red Raiders were likewise rewarded with four All-America selections -- all on defense. Miami wide receiver Malachi Toney is the lone true freshman to earn a 2025 All-America spot with a second-team selection, while Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin picked up a third-team selection as a redshirt freshman. \nCheck out the full list of AP All-American team selections below. First teamOffenseQB: Fernando Mendoza, junior, IndianaRB: Jeremiyah Love, junior, Notre DameRB: Ahmad Hardy, sophomore, MissouriOT: Francis Mauigoa, junior, MiamiOT: Spencer Fano, junior, UtahOG: Emmanuel Pregnon, senior, OregonOG: Beau Stephens, senior, IowaC: Logan Jones, graduate, IowaTE: Eli Stowers, graduate, VanderbiltWR: Makai Lemon, junior, USCWR: Jeremiah Smith, sophomore, Ohio StateWR: Skylar Bell, senior, UConnAP: KC Concepcion, junior, Texas A&MK: Kansei Matsuzawa, senior, HawaiiDefenseEDGE: David Bailey, senior, Texas TechEDGE: Cashius Howell, senior, Texas A&MDT: Kayden McDonald, junior, Ohio StateDT: Landon Robinson, senior, NavyLB: Jacob Rodriguez, senior, Texas TechLB: Arvell Reese, junior, Ohio StateLB: CJ Allen, junior, GeorgiaCB: Leonard Moore, sophomore, Notre DameCB: Mansoor Delane, senior, LSUS: Caleb Downs, junior, Ohio StateS: Bishop Fitzgerald, senior, USCDB: Jakari Foster, senior, Louisiana TechP: Cole Maynard, senior, Western KentuckySecond teamOffenseQB: Diego Pavia, graduate, VanderbiltRB: Emmett Johnson, junior, NebraskaRB: Kewan Lacy, sophomore, Ole MissOT: Kadyn Proctor, junior, AlabamaOT: Carter Smith, junior, IndianaOG: Olaivavega Ioane, junior, Penn StateOG: Ar'maj Reed-Adams, graduate, Texas A&MC: Jake Slaughter, senior, FloridaTE: Kenyon Sadiq, junior, OregonWR: Carnell Tate, junior, Ohio StateWR: Malachi Toney, freshman, MiamiWR: Danny Scudero, sophomore, San Jose StateAP: Wayne Knight, junior, James MadisonK: Tate Sandell, junior, Oklahoma\nDefenseEDGE: Rueben Bain Jr., junior, MiamiEDGE: John Henry Daley, sophomore, UtahDT: A.J.

    "body": "\n        Florida quarterback DJ Lagway is on the move. The former five-star prospect and sophomore intends to enter the transfer portal when it opens in January, ending a brief but impactful stint with the Gators. Lagway arrived as one of the highest-rated recruits of the Billy Napier era and quickly made a name for himself with a breakout true freshman season in 2024. Injuries and a coaching change slowed his development this past year, and sources told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer that Lagway ultimately decided the new staff and program direction did not match his vision.Lagway's profile makes him one of the most intriguing quarterbacks on the market: a physically gifted, dual-threat talent with first-round NFL Draft upside. Teams in need of an immediate starter and a dynamic playmaker will likely circle him, weighing both his potential and the risks that come with a recent injury-affected season.Early indications suggest a wide array of programs could be in play for the former No. 1 quarterback prospect in the 2024 class.\n\n    \n                                        \n    BaylorBaylor makes sense as a homecoming option for Lagway, with the Bears located a little more than two hours from his hometown of Willis, Texas. Baylor did offer during Lagway's high school recruitment, and a return to the Lone Star State could appeal to a quarterback looking for familiarity after two seasons in Gainesville. There is also a family tie, as Lagway's father played at Baylor. While the Bears' staff looks different now -- with primary recruiters Shawn Bell and Jeff Grimes no longer in Waco -- the program still presents a clear opportunity at the position.Sawyer Robertson wrapped up his career as one of the most productive quarterbacks in Baylor history, finishing top five in career and single-season records for passing yards as well as passing touchdowns while serving as the full-time starter over the past two seasons. That production leaves a significant opening moving forward, and offensive coordinator Jake Spavital, entering his third year with the Bears, could offer Lagway a system built to maximize his dual-threat skill set. \n    \n                                        \n    DukeThe Blue Devils could be an option, but it hinges almost entirely on Darian Mensah's future. Mensah signed a lucrative NIL deal believed to be worth $8 million over two seasons, yet his on-field production in 2025 -- 30 touchdown passes against five interceptions while leading Duke to an ACC title -- has put him squarely on the radar as a potential 2026 NFL Draft entrant.\nWhile there's been purely outside speculation about Mensah reuniting with former Tulane coach Jon Sumrall at Florida, there's been no indication he plans to transfer. If Mensah does declare early, however, Duke would be left with a significant vacancy at quarterback, creating a clear path for Lagway to step into a proven ACC offense.\n    \n                                        \n    Florida StateFrom Gainesville to Tallahassee? That would be a headline-grabbing move, given the rarity -- though growing frequency -- of high-profile transfers crossing rivalry lines. Lagway went 2-0 against the Seminoles during his time at Florida, completing 29 of 46 passes for 301 yards with five touchdowns and two interceptions, and would arrive in Tallahassee with proven familiarity against the program. With the NCAA recently denying Tommy Castellanos an additional year of eligibility, Mike Norvell could be motivated to pursue a splash addition at quarterback rather than turning the offense over to younger, unproven options in Brock Glenn or Kevin Sperry, making Lagway a bold but logical target if Florida State prioritizes immediate experience at the position.\n    \n                                        \n    ClemsonClemson represents a familiar name in Lagway's recruiting story, as the Tigers made a late push to flip him from Florida just days before the December signing period in 2023. Clemson was among his finalists before he ultimately committed to the Gators, and the program now finds itself in need of a quarterback following three-year starter Cade Klubnik exhausting his eligibility. Backup Christopher Vizzina enters his fourth year after seeing limited action, including just one start -- a loss to SMU -- leaving an opening for a transfer to step into a program accustomed to competing at the ACC's highest level.\n\n    \n                                        \n    LSULSU could be an intriguing landing spot as new coach Lane Kiffin looks for his next quarterback in Baton Rouge. While Lagway's five-interception outing against the Tigers this season is one to forget, he did lead Florida to a win over Kiffin's Rebels in 2024 during a four-game end-of-season streak, showing he can perform in high-pressure SEC matchups. Kiffin even shared a social media post Monday acknowledging Lagway's decision to enter the transfer portal, so take that for what it's worth.\n    \n                                        \n    MiamiThe Hurricanes present another in-state rivalry option, with Miami set to enter the offseason with a quarterback vacancy again. The program has a strong recent track record of elevating transfer signal-callers into high-level talent -- Cam Ward became the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, while Carson Beck has emerged with renewed confidence leading Miami to its first College Football Playoff appearance. Lagway could step into a program built to elevate experienced quarterbacks and recapture that status as a former five-star prospect.\n    \n                                        \n    Texas TechThe Red Raiders have built a reputation as big spenders in the transfer portal, turning those moves into a Big 12 title and a first-round bye in the CFP. While the program remains confident in redshirt freshman Will Hammond -- who saw action in eight games and made two starts for an injured Behren Morton before tearing his ACL against Oklahoma State in October -- the injury clouds Texas Tech's quarterback plans moving forward. That uncertainty could open the door for Lagway to step in and compete for the starting role immediately.\n            ",

The Broncos are coming off yet another fourth-quarter comeback against the Houston Texans, a game in which they won, 18-15. The Raiders on the other hand fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars in overtime, 30-29.While the Broncos are currently sitting atop their division, their lead over the Los Angeles Chargers (6-3) and Kansas City Chiefs (5-4) is one and two games, respectively. Additionally, Denver still has to have both meetings with Kansas City and it hosts Los Angeles in the regular season finale so there's no opportunity for the Broncos to take their foot off the gas.Click here to bet Raiders vs. Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Despite the Raiders' loss on Sunday, Smith turned in one of his best performances of the year, as he threw for 284 yards, a season-high four touchdowns against only one interception. He clearly missed tight end Brock Bowers, as the young star caught 12 passes for 127 yards and three touchdowns in his return to the lineup after missing the last three games due to a knee injury. As for the Broncos, their second-year signal-caller Nix passed John Elway for the most wins (17) in a quarterback's first two seasons in Broncos history. He registered the seventh game-winning drive of his career this past week, and his fourth this season. The 7-2 start is Denver's best since 2015, when Peyton Manning led the Broncos to a Super Bowl victory. What will happen this year?Where to watch Raiders vs. Broncos liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 6 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoStream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -9.5; O/U 42.5 (via FanDuel)Raiders vs. Broncos: Need to knowThe Broncos are streaking. The Broncos have now won six straight games, which is tied for the longest active streak in the NFL with the New England Patriots. Denver has also won nine straight home games, which marks the longest active streak in the league. Denver is dominating on defense and in the trenches. The Broncos defense leads the NFL in sacks per game (4.4), third-down percentage (28.2%) and red zone touchdown percentage (34.8%). Denver has recorded the most sacks (40) and is tied in allowing the fewest sacks (9) this season. Las Vegas is down a receiver. Vegas won't have wide receiver Jakobi Meyers in the lineup moving forward, as just before Tuesday's trade deadline the Raiders dealt him to the Jaguars for fourth- and sixth-round picks. The 28-year-old wideout caught 33 passes for 352 yards in seven games played this season. More pressure will be placed on leading receiver Tre Tucker, as well as rookies Dont'e Thornton Jr. and Jack Bech. History suggests Raiders are not-ready-for-prime-time players. The Raiders have lost seven straight road games in prime time, with their last win coming in 2017 against the Miami Dolphins on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Vegas has also scored fewer than 10 points in back-to-back prime-time games, and been out-scored 71-6 over the last two road games.Fourth-quarter kings: There's no denying that the Broncos offense has been Jekyll and Hyde for most of the season. It can look like one of the most anemic units in the league one moment, then drop 33 points in a quarter the next. The Broncos have four game-winning drives this season, which is tied for most in the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and own the league's best fourth-quarter point differential (+66) during this current six-game win streak. No team should feel safe with a lead in the fourth quarter against Denver -- no matter how many points it is. Raiders vs. Broncos prediction, pick\nThe Broncos have made a habit of playing close games against inferior opponents. They struggled with the Tennessee Titans in the season opener, defeated the lowly New York Jets by just two points and needed a historic comeback to beat the New York Giants. It wouldn't surprise me to see this game come down to the fourth quarter, but I'll take Denver to cover the spread as long as the number is under 10. Smith is 0-5 against the spread in prime time since the start of last season, while Nix is 3-1 straight up and against the spread in his career in prime time. Pick: Broncos -9.5, Over 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Pete Carroll's first year in Las Vegas has been a total disappointment. The Raiders are sitting at 2-6, and now they're on the road on Thursday night for a Week 10 showdown with the Denver Broncos. If the divisional clash goes anything like the Raiders' last two road games, things could get ugly. In Week 6, Carroll's team traveled to Indianapolis and suffered a 40-6 blowout loss against the Colts -- their largest loss in four years. Two weeks later, the Chiefs handed Las Vegas their largest shutout loss since 2014 with a 31-0 result.The Raiders have lost two straight road games by at least 30 points, and if they lose by 30 or more in Denver, that will make it three straight, which is almost unheard of in the NFL.The last team to lose three straight road games by 30 points or more was the Buffalo Bills, who did it during a stretch that went from the end of the 1984 season into the 1985 season, according to CBS Sports Research. It's literally been 40 years since any team has struggled like that on the road, and the Raiders could match them on Thursday.The fact this game is being played in prime time probably isn't going to help things because the Raiders haven't won a road prime-time game in eight years (their last win came on Nov. 5, 2017). Since then, they've gone 0-7.\nTo make things even more difficult, the Raiders have to face the hottest team in the NFL. The Broncos will be heading into Thursday's game on a six-game winning streak, which is tied with the Patriots for the longest in the league. The Broncos have also won nine straight home games, which is the longest active streak in the NFL and Denver's longest home winning streak since 2015 when it won Super Bowl 50.If you think the Broncos have a chance to beat the Raiders by at least 30 points, oddsmakers like FanDuel Sportsbook have priced those odds accordingly: Denver -29.5 is priced at +1100 (a $10 bet wins $110).\nIf the Raiders want to cling to some sort of hope, the Broncos have lost four of their past Thursday night games, so an upset isn't impossible. The Raiders are 9.5-point underdogs, but they might have a chance in Denver -- and that's because they got their not-so-secret weapon back last week: tight end Brock Bowers. Bowers returned in Week 9 with a monster performance during which he caught 12 passes for 127 yards and three touchdowns in a 30-29 loss to Jacksonville. \nThe Raiders are a completely different offense when he's in the lineup: Las Vegas has averaged 21.2 points per game when he's on the field and 8.7 points in the three games he missed due to injury. That 21.2 average is big this week, because if the Raiders (2-6) can top 20 points against Denver, they'll have a fighting chance: The Broncos are 5-0 when they hold their opponent under 20 points, but just 2-2 when they surrender 20 points or more. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 10 NFL schedule kicks with the Denver Broncos vs. the Las Vegas Raiders in an AFC West showdown on 'Thursday Night Football.' The games starts at 8:15 p.m. ET, and daily Fantasy football players will have to be creative when looking for production since this game only has an over/under of 42.5, the fourth lowest of the week. Denver has an elite defense, while Las Vegas has struggled offensively, so can you trust Las Vegas players like Geno Smith, Brock Bowers or Ashton Jeanty as NFL DFS picks?On the Denver side, Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton and JK Dobbins will all be popular for NFL DFS lineups. Meanwhile, with Vegas just trading away Jakobi Meyers, could Raheem Mostert be more of a factor out of the backfield in the passing game?

The second-year pro was dominant as a rookie, but has been limited by injuries in 2025. He got back on the field in Week 9, however, and put up a massive 12-127-3 receiving line against the Jaguars. Denver's defense is elite, but the Broncos have given opposing tight ends a little space as they ranked outside the top 10 in Fantasy points given up against the position, so Bowers is one Las Vegas player who could do some damage on Thursday. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, who has an over/under of 71.5 rushing yards. Dobbins hasn't been much of a touchdown threat, but he's been a high-floor option in recent weeks due to his total workload. He's averaging more than 14 carries per game over the past three weeks, and he's averaged an efficient 5.2 yards per carry during that span. With Denver favored by more than a touchdown, there's a good chance that the game flow will allow him to see plenty of carries. Additionally, the Raiders allowed Travis Etienne of Jacksonville to go for 115 scrimmage yards last week. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Raiders vs. BroncosMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.'

    "body": "\n        A classic rivalry will have its next installment on 'Thursday Night Football' to kick off NFL Week 10 as the Denver Broncos host the Las Vegas Raiders. Denver (7-2) is tied for the best record in the league and is riding a six-game win streak, which is also tied for the NFL's longest. The Broncos had a comeback victory at Houston in Week 9, defeating the Texans, 18-15, via a walk-off field goal. Meanwhile, the Raiders (2-6) suffered a defeat out of their bye on Sunday as they lost in overtime to Jacksonville, 30-29. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 73-56-2. Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) and receiver Marvin Mims (concussion) have been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver. The Broncos swept the season series in 2024, after the Raiders had won each of the previous eight meetings. The Raiders are 7-3 ATS over the last 10 matchups. The latest Raiders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 9.5-point favorites, making it the biggest favorite of Week 10. The over/under for total points is 43. Denver is at -521 on the money line (risk $521 to win $100), with Vegas at +388 (risk $100 to win $388).

Meanwhile, Denver hasn't lived up to being a heavy favorite this season, going just 1-3 against the spread when favored by at least a touchdown. The Broncos have also gone just 1-4 straight up over their last five Thursday games as short turnarounds haven't worked in their favor.Vegas does have several standouts who can make this game competitive, starting with Geno Smith, who is coming off a four-passing touchdown on Sunday. Three of those were caught by Brock Bowers, who had missed the three previous games. Rookie Ashton Jeanty is averaging 94.6 scrimmage yards over his last five games, with five total touchdowns over that stretch. Then, there's Maxx Crosby on defense, and the four-time Pro Bowler has three sacks over his last three games and ranks third in the NFL with 13 tackles for loss. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Broncos can coverDenver has arguably the best defense in the NFL, ranking first in a number of categories. The lead the league in the most important of defensive metrics, with the top-ranked third-down defense, as well as the No. 1 redzone defense. A big part of that success is the unparalleled ability for Denver to take down the quarterback. The Broncos' 40 sacks are the most in the league, and that puts them on pace for 76 on the season, which would break the NFL's single-season record of 72 sacks by the 1984 Chicago Bears.On offense, the Broncos are simply a different team at home, with TNF taking place in Denver. The team is averaging 31.3 points at home, compared to 20 points on the road, while the Raiders equally struggle much more when leaving Vegas. Just as Denver averages 31.3 points at home, the Raiders allow 31.3 points on the road, and Las Vegas has scored just five touchdowns on offense across four road games. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $150 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Broncos vs. Raiders picksFor the NFL Week 10 'Thursday Night Football' game of Raiders vs. Broncos, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 47 total points.

The junior was near flawless, completing 31 of 33 passes (93.9%) for 370 yards and four touchdowns in a 48-26 win over Tulane when playing on Thursday last week. McCown, the son of former NFL cornerback Josh McCown, has 10 touchdowns compared to two interceptions over his last four games, and he's averaging 210 passing yards per game on the season. Outside of its opening matchup against Texas A&M, which is currently ranked No. 3 in the nation, UTSA has covered a 13.5-point spread in six of seven games this season. South Florida is a quality team at 6-2 overall and 3-1 in the conference, but the model views this as too many points for a capable offense led by McCown. The model projects UTSA to cover in 63% of simulations. Back UTSA at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Broncos (-9.5) vs. Raiders (-110)Pete Carroll's return to an NFL sideline has been a tough one the majority of the season, as the Raiders are 2-6 in his first year as Las Vegas head coach, with four of those losses coming by double digits. The Raiders' last four results include a 31-0 loss to the Chiefs and a 40-6 loss to the Colts, and with the Broncos having a 7-2 record entering Thursday Night Football, they are approaching that elite AFC status of teams like the Chiefs and Colts. The Raiders are 29th in scoring (16.5 ppg) and 30th in total yards (283.3 per game), and they traded arguably their most talented wide receiver in Jacobi Meyers at the trade deadline. The Broncos have won six straight gam=ames, and the model expects that to continue convincingly, projecting Denver to cover the spread in 62% of simulations. Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Suns (-2.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Clippers will be without their two superstars on Thursday with James Harden (personal) and Kawhi Leonard (ankle) both out. Having one of them out is a significant loss for Los Angeles, but both being out is a situation the model doesn't project the Clippers will overcome. Devin Booker is averaging 31 points and seven assists as the clear alpha for the Suns this season, and he's coming off scoring 38 points against the Warriors on Tuesday. The Suns are home on Thursday, and they are 3-1 at home this season, with their only loss in Phoenix coming in a 114-113 final against the Grizzlies.

    "body": "\n        Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.             We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.              We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to sit Noah Fant).

What could stand to change is Tucker's average depth of target, which has clunked from 11.6 yards in his first five games to 3.1 in his past three. Even Tyler Lockett, who should play more than the 19 snaps he had in Week 9 with Meyers gone, had a higher ADOT in his first game with the Raiders than Tucker did in any of his last three. The Broncos have held opposing wideouts to 2.8 yards after the catch on the season with their best week ever coming in Week 9 at Houston without Pat Surtain II on the field. The Broncos are also third best in catch rate allowed on throws of 20-plus air yards, so even if the Raiders did opt to try using Tucker deep they'd struggle based on how Denver's done. In four games with six-plus targets this season, Tucker had one mammoth showing at Washington in Week 3 and three games with 11.1 or fewer PPR points. I wouldn't expect much more than that from Tucker this week. JK Dobbins has had single-digit PPR points in three of his past four games but his role doesn't seem to be changing much. He's had at least 15 touches in all but one of his past six games and he's averaged over 4.0 yards per rush in all but one of those six. He's doing what's asked of him by the Broncos coaches but he's not fetching targets (13 on the year for nine receptions) and he's not scoring touchdowns (one in his past six). Rookie R.J. Harvey, meanwhile, has scored in three straight and has 23 receptions on the year (five last week), but it's not like his playing time or workload have changed. Sean Payton has not lost to a Pete Carroll-coached team since the 2013 playoffs and the minus-9.5 point spread suggests he'll win again. The Raiders have seen opposing RBs get at least 30 carries in two straight games and have still shown good efficiency (under 3.9 yards per carry in each). Still, if it's going to be a Denver win with a shot at the backs splitting 30 carries, then both are in play as at least flexes.MUST-STARTS: Brock BowersSTARTS: Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton (No. 2 WR), Ashton Jeanty (No. 2 RB), JK Dobbins (low-end No. 2 RB), Broncos DST\nFLEX: Troy Franklin, Tre Tucker (low-end PPR flex)SITS: Geno Smith, R.J.

This week will be an interesting first test -- will he play Gardner to one side of the field, or will he have him shadow Drake London? The answer lies in how the other Colts cornerbacks can perform -- Mekhi Blackmon has played decently well in place of Charvarius Ward and at least was better tackling than Jaylon Jones was in Jones' first game back. My guess is that the Colts keep things easy to start the game and keep Blackmon on one side of the field and Gardner on the other, changing things up if London and others crush Blackmon (Gardner did not shadow London in a 2023 meeting). Michael Penix Jr. has been a little more efficient throwing to his right than his left this season (higher EPA per dropback, higher QB rating, slightly higher completion rate and yards per attempt), so the Colts could open the game with Gardner defending that side. Pair Gardner's arrival with a Colts pass rush that should be free to blitz more with the stud cornerback defending large swaths of the field and a QB in Penix who doesn't get the ball out super-fast like Aaron Rodgers did against Indy last week and the Colts should be improved. After last week's loss at Pittsburgh, Colts coach Shane Steichen expressed remorse in how he prepped his offensive line for the Steelers pass rush and lamented not being more balanced on offense. His chance at redemption comes this week against a Falcons pass rush ranked first in blitz rate. He can negate that with a combination of Jonathan Taylor runs and quick throws from Daniel Jones. Dink-and-dunk throws from Jones aren't anything new, and he could easily follow the footsteps Tua Tagovailoa had against Atlanta two weeks ago when he got the ball out fast and turned in a great performance while negating the Falcons pass rush. If and when that happens, don't expect either Josh Downs or Alec Pierce to be big-time contributors; even though Downs has a very high 37.2% target per route rate when Jones has gotten the ball out under 2.5 seconds, he hasn't done a ton with it. Pierce's rate isn't even one-third of Downs'. And if Taylor gets back to attacking on the ground then there won't be much upside for Jones' numbers either. \nMUST-STARTS: Jonathan Taylor, Bijan Robinson, Drake London, Michael PittmanSTARTS: Daniel Jones (borderline No. 1/2 QB), Tyler Warren, Kyle Pitts (borderline No. 1/2 TE), Colts DST (bye next week)FLEX: Josh Downs (low-end PPR flex)SITS: Michael Penix Jr., Alec Pierce (desperation WR), Darnell Mooney, Tyler Allgeier, Ameer Abdullah, Falcons DST (vs. CAR next week)\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nRashid Shaheed averaged 7.3 targets and a 22.2% target per route run rate for the Saints. The void left by his absence will probably be split up by everyone else on the team but especially reception machine Chris Olave and tight end Juwan Johnson. In effectively six quarters of play with Tyler Shough in Weeks 8 and 9, Johnson saw 10 targets and turned them into a cumulative 6-66-1 stat line. Given the lack of other quality receivers in New Orleans, it's a pretty safe bet we'll see Johnson continue to get looks from Shough, elevating his value this week and rest of season. Four tight ends have topped 10 PPR points against the Panthers this year, a number that would have probably been five if not for Tucker Kraft's injury last week (he and Luke Musgrave combined for 10.4). You could literally add Johnson off waivers and start him in Week 10. \nMUST-STARTS: Rico DowdleSTARTS: Chris Olave (flex in non-PPR), Tetairoa McMillan (low-end No. 2 WR), Panthers DST (one week only)FLEX: Alvin KamaraSITS: Bryce Young, Tyler Shough, Jalen Coker, Brandin Cooks, Devin Neal, Chuba Hubbard, Xavier Legette, Ja'Tavion Sanders, Devaughn Vele, Saints DST\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nIt would be shocking if the Giants developed a run game after bottoming out last week with Tyrone Tracy and Devin Singletary. Chicago's run defense has been pretty great over its past four games anyway, excluding garbage time (3.7 yards per carry, 4.2% explosive run rate allowed, two touchdowns to Derrick Henry). Bank on the Giants leaning into Jaxson Dart just as they have since Week 4, especially against a Bears defense that's had a hard time creating pass rush pressure. It's huge for Dart, who is much more effective when unpressured (70% completion rate, 7.0 yards per attempt, 6.9% TD rate) than pressured (40% completion rate, 6.0 yards per attempt, 2.2% TD rate). Both Wan'Dale Robinson and Darius Slayton have seen a jump in targets per route run when Dart's not pressured this season to at least 24.7% for each. It's huge, especially against a Bears defense that gave up 17-plus PPR points to three Bengals receivers last week. Theo Johnson's also in play -- a tight end has scored 10.8-plus PPR against Chicago in three of its past four, and the lone game one didn't Mark Andrews and Charlie Kolar combined for 14.4. \nIn their past two games together, Swift has had just a slight lead in terms of overall snaps played (52% and 50% compared to 46% and 45% for Monangai). That equality has not been the same in terms of carries (Swift had 19 to Monangai's 13 in Week 7, 11 to 7 in Week 8) or total touches (Swift had 20 to Monangai's 15 in Week 7, 13 to 7 in Week 9), but it's obviously been close. In New York's past five games they've yielded 5.7 yards per rush to running backs, and that includes a 3.8-yard average against the Saints in Week 5 (throw it out and the rushing average balloons to 6.1). Dexter Lawrence's play has clearly been impacted by his injury and the linebackers aren't doing a good job slamming on the run. As a team the Giants missed 10 tackles last week. It should set up for a lot of good, high-efficient work from both Swift and Monangai, though Swift's edge in carries/touches as well as working near the goal line and on third downs make him more appealing. But in a week where there aren't a lot of reliable running backs, Monangai sets up as a 10-touch, 60-yard runner with some touchdown potential, especially if the game ends up being high scoring.  STARTS: Jaxson Dart, Caleb Williams, D'Andre Swift, Rome Odunze, Wan'Dale Robinson (low-end No. 2 PPR WR)FLEX: D.J.

Houston brings a lot of pass rush pressure but struggle to rack up a ton of sacks. Behind that D-line is one of the best secondaries in football; only eight touchdowns have been caught on them and half were by wide receivers. The only two receivers with more than 80 yards against the Texans? Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Puka Nacua, both of whom had 11-plus targets. This is not the matchup to trust Jakobi Meyers in his first game with the Jaguars in. As for Parker Washington, his nine-plus targets in two straight games offers some hope that he can be just the third receiver to have 10-plus PPR points while playing at least 40% of his snaps in the slot against the Texans. STARTS: Nico Collins, Travis Etienne (No. 2 RB), Dalton Schultz, Texans DST (at TEN in Week 11)FLEX: Parker Washington (high-end PPR flex), Woody Marks SITS: Trevor Lawrence, Davis Mills, Dalton Schultz (high-end No. 2 PPR TE), Nick Chubb, Bhayshul Tuten, Christian Kirk, Xavier Hutchinson, Brenton Strange (stash!), Jaguars DST (high-end No. 2 DST)\n\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nWith Jaelan Phillips now in Philly and Chop Robinson unsure to play, it's especially hard to see how the Dolphins can rush Josh Allen and slow down the Bills offense down. Miami couldn't hang with the Bills back in Week 3 when they did have Phillips (and Tyreek Hill), so it's unlikely they can hang now. Their best bet is to run the ball with both De'Von Achane and Ollie Gordon to try and take advantage of a defense that's allowed 4.9 yards per rush over its past four games excluding garbage time. That may keep the Dolphins close in the first half but it's easy to see the Bills pull away in the second half, potentially with their own run game as Miami's let up 5.3 yards per rush in its past five.

McCarthy played much better than expected last week in a hostile environment against a really good Lions pass rush. A rushing touchdown made all the difference in Fantasy but his mobility out of the pocket was again a much-needed asset to help the Vikings pull off the win. He'll have an easier matchup this week versus a Ravens defense that's struggled to get pass rush pressure rate higher than 27.6% on quarterbacks for five straight weeks (eight total sacks). I don't view the addition of journeyman Dre'Mont Jones to be a major difference-maker for Baltimore, and as long as the Vikings offensive line holds up then McCarthy should be in position to make some throws to his top receivers while also utilizing Aaron Jones out of the backfield. \nMUST-STARTS: Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry, Justin Jefferson (No. 2 WR)STARTS: Zay Flowers, Mark Andrews, Aaron Jones (low-end No. 2 RB)FLEX: Jordan Addison (borderline No. 2/3 WR)SITS: J.J.

Cleveland would be nuts not to attack on the ground considering Quinnen Williams' departure, safety Andre Cisco's absence and Quincy Williams' benching. <i>With</i> those guys the Jets allowed 4.0 yards per carry, two touchdowns and a 4.3% explosive run rate over 16 carries -- not too bad. Without them I just don't think the Jets have enough beyond Jamien Sherwood and Malachi Moore to make a lot of stops. Both Sherwood and Moore will be part of the coverage assigned to the Browns tight ends as well, and both have been pretty good at making tackles and limiting yards after the catch. That'll be crucial since both Harold Fannin (23.9%) and David Njoku (25.6%) have the two highest target per route run rates among pass-catchers with Dillon Gabriel this season.

One game ago the Bucs defense helped them build a lead on the Saints and the offense opted for a slow-paced, run-heavy approach over just nine drives in a blowout win. This is to suggest that we haven't seen the Bucs offense look like themselves since Week 6, and even then they leaned on the run. New England's run defense has been amazing, holding RBs over their past five games excluding garbage time to 3.0 yards per carry with zero rush TDs and a 1.4% explosive rush rate allowed. That's insanely good. However, the Patriots pass rush hasn't been dominant since their win over the Titans and the Bucs offensive line should not only be rested but deeper with tackle Luke Goedeke having a chance to return. Christian Gonzalez's presence would help the defense in a big way, especially against Egbuka, but even if he plays this feels like a bounce-back game for Baker Mayfield since he should have to do a lot of passing.  STARTS: Drake Maye, Baker Mayfield, Emeka Egbuka, TreVeyon Henderson and Rachaad White (both low-end No. 2 RBs), Patriots DST (low-end DST)FLEX: Stefon Diggs, DeMario Douglas, Tez JohnsonSITS: Cade Otton (borderline No. 1/2 TE), Hunter Henry, Sean Tucker (stash!), Terrell Jennings (desperation RB), Kyle Williams (deep stash), Buccaneers DST\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nJacoby Brissett has been great in his past three starts and has conquered a good pass rush already this year, but playing at Seattle will be very difficult. The Seahawks, a zone-heavy defense, tends to consistently get pass rush pressure without blitzing. That's a big problem for Brissett, who when pressured has a 44.2% completion rate, 6.0 yards per attempt, zero touchdowns and a drop in catchable pass attempts from 95.7% to 67.4%. It'll be even worse for his run game as the Seahawks have been unreal against the run in their past four games, so it's fair to expect Brissett to throw a lot. That volume could result in some high numbers, but some high turnovers too. Just two QBs have scored more than 20.8 Fantasy points on the Seahawks, and both faced them with not just cornerback Devon Witherspoon out but other Seahawks defensive starters missing the game. They're expected to be healthy for Week 10. This is a good week to avoid Brissett if you can since he has much more downside than usual.Arizona's defense is healthy and had many good moments last week at Dallas but still couldn't wrangle a pass rush pressure rate higher than 36%, which was their second-highest mark in a game this year. That should bode well for Sam Darnold, who has scored at least 18.1 Fantasy points in five of six games when he's been pressured under 40% of the time with 20.7 points in four of those five. And it absolutely helps him to have Rashid Shaheed, a downfield receiver who played in this same offensive system in 2024. Shaheed should be acclimated quickly and may alter how defenses plot against the Seahawks, including how they approach the Seattle run game. No longer can defenses key in on Jaxon Smith-Njigba and take their chances with other Seahawks pass-catchers without paying. It should mean more light boxes for Seattle to run into and, theoretically, better efficiency for their running backs. Better blocking would help. Arizona's run defense remained suspect last week and could be ripe for some modest numbers versus Seattle's rushing duo. I think Darnold can be pretty good, but the Cardinals pass defense deserves at least a little credit, so don't expect a huge game.  MUST-STARTS: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Trey McBrideSTARTS: Marvin Harrison Jr., Kenneth Walker III (low-end No. 2 RB), Seahawks DSTFLEX: Zach Charbonnet (low-end flex)SITS: Sam Darnold (high-end No. 2 QB), Jacoby Brissett (bye-week QB), Michael Wilson, Emari Demercado (desperation RB), Zonovan Knight, Tory Horton, Cardinals DST\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nThe 49ers took it to the Rams in their Week 5 matchup, overcoming their pass rush by getting the ball out fast (2.4 seconds on average by Mac Jones, who leaned on his connection with Kendrick Bourne to help break the Rams). Since then the 49ers defense has lost several more key starters and has struggled to develop a pass rush, and the Rams have improved their secondary and remain one of the best overall defenses in the league. There hasn't been a blowout in the series since late October 2022 when the Niners won 31-14. Figure the 49ers scheme to keep things close with short passes again, but this time George Kittle and Jauan Jennings help out much more than Bourne. MUST-STARTS: Christian McCaffrey, Kyren Williams, Puka Nacua, Davante AdamsSTARTS: Matthew Stafford, George KittleFLEX: Jauan Jennings SITS: Mac Jones, Kendrick Bourne, Tyler Higbee, Blake Corum, Brian Robinson Jr., Rams DST (high-end No. 2 DST), 49ers DST\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nNo Jayden Daniels, no Terry McLaurin, no quality pass rush and a Lions team coming to D.C. after a tough home loss. You couldn't have come up with a worse nightmare scenario for the Commanders in Week 10. Against Seattle last week the Commanders got a pass rush pressure on 12.5% of the Seahawks' dropbacks. That's really bad and potentially a green light for Jared Goff to tee off against a Commanders secondary that prefers to play man-to-man coverage. Usually man-to-man coverage brings out the best target per route run rate in Amon-Ra St. Brown, not Sam LaPorta or Jameson Williams. And LaPorta's worst games are typically when the Lions and especially Jahmyr Gibbs can't get going (Week 9 is the most recent example). Starting LaPorta is something we'll all do, but maybe don't expect anything like last week. Gibbs should bounce back and even David Montgomery has a shot at another score in what figures to be a Lions blowout. With the Lions run defense so strong, this should be the game the Commanders lean into Deebo Samuel on screens and slants as a change-up to handing off. Problem is that Samuel has not looked like himself since coming back from injury a few weeks ago. He did get loose for a 19-yard catch-and-run last week but he otherwise was simply a short-area target. And it gets worse with Marcus Mariota under center: On the year Samuel has an 18.3% target per route run rate. By comparison, Terry McLaurin's was 26.7% with Mariota, that's really good. In games without McLaurin, Samuel's rate has gone <i>down</i> to 12.5%! Samuel is OK as a PPR flex but I'd be nervous starting him even then. MUST-STARTS: Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. BrownSTARTS: Jared Goff, David Montgomery, Sam LaPorta, Lions DSTFLEX: Deebo Samuel (PPR), Jameson Williams SITS: Marcus Mariota, Zach Ertz, Jeremy McNichols (desperation PPR RB), Jaylin Lane (deep stash), Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Chris Rodriguez, Commanders DST \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nThe Steelers edge rushers and defensive line were amped up last week, rattling the Colts offensive line and making big plays in the backfield both against Daniel Jones and Jonathan Taylor. I'm not sure how much of that is transferable to this week's matchup but it will absolutely help them that the Chargers won't have Joe Alt at left tackle. Many Chargers metrics, including their offensive EPA and Justin Herbert's passing efficiency, are starkly different without Alt on the field. That includes Herbert's time to throw average (3.01 with Alt, 2.85 without Alt) and average depth of throw (9.1 air yards with Alt, 6.9 without Alt), both clearly hinting at Herbert throwing shorter so as to avoid getting shellacked. This figures to especially help not just Ladd McConkey but also Keenan Allen and Oronde Gadsden II while hurting Quentin Johnston (Allen less as much because his route rate has dipped in consecutive weeks). We've already seen the Steelers allow 15-plus PPR points to multiple wide receivers in four games this year (including last week!), and they've given up at least 9.8 half-PPR points to tight ends in five of their past seven. Expect Herbert to get the ball out quickly to short-area targets.I also wouldn't pencil in a heavy workload for Kimani Vidal. By the second half, Jaret Patterson was mixing in with Vidal and actually outproduced him, so much so that the coaches gave Patterson the snaps to close out their seven-point win over the Titans. This doesn't mean that Patterson is suddenly an option in Fantasy, but any work he picks up as a result obviously diminishes Vidal's upside. It doesn't help that the Steelers are fresh off of slowing down Jonathan Taylor and limiting Josh Jacobs in consecutive weeks.  MUST-STARTS: Ladd McConkeySTARTS: Justin Herbert, Jaylen Warren, Kimani Vidal (low-end No. 2 RB), Oronde Gadsden II, DK Metcalf, Chargers DST (low-end DST)  FLEX: Quentin Johnston and Keenan Allen (Johnston higher in non- and half-PPR)SITS: Aaron Rodgers, Calvin Austin III (desperation WR), Kenneth Gainwell, Pat Freiermuth (stash), Jonnu Smith, Steelers DST (tough matchups until maybe Week 15)\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nAll season long, Jordan Love's Achilles heel has been pass rush pressure. He has yet to throw a touchdown under pressure, has completed just 37.7% of his throws when pressured, has a catchable attempt rate of 68.8% when he's pressured and averages a weak 4.7 yards per attempt when pressured. And now he'll take on an Eagles defense that was already better than league average in pass rush pressure rate and added edge rusher Jaelan Phillips, who has experience working in this specific defensive scheme. It sure doesn't help that Tucker Kraft, the guy with an 18.7% target per route run rate when Love's been pressured, is out for the year. MUST-STARTS: Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Josh JacobsSTARTS: DeVonta Smith, A.J.

    "body": "\n        The final month of the regular season is always filled with posturing from teams and conferences vying for College Football Playoff spots, and coaches already began standing up for their leagues in the hunt for postseason berths. Prior to the debut CFP Top 25 rankings reveal, it was Texas' Steve Sarkisian championing three-loss SEC teams as playoff candidates. And after the rankings were unveiled, Nebraska's Matt Rhule spoke in defense of the Big Ten.Rhule specifically pointed to the quartet of two-loss teams in his conference and vouched for them in their respective quests for CFP bids. If one of the squads in that bunch – No. 19 USC, No. 20 Iowa, No. 21 Michigan and No. 23 Washington -- got into the bracket, the Big Ten could have four teams represented in the race for the national championship.\"I think the Big Ten teams with two losses are underappreciated,\" Rhule said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think Iowa's having a heck of a season. I think SC is having a heck of a season, and many more. Michigan is at 7-2. … I do think there are some really good teams in the Big Ten. We deserve four in.\"The CFP selection committee views each of the Big Ten's two-loss teams similarly and effectively grouped them into a tier in its first batch of rankings. The committee respects those squads as playoff contenders but, for the moment, has them on the outside looking in at the 12-team bracket. It also placed them behind two-loss teams from all of the other power conferences, sending a clear message that their résumés are weaker than some of their SEC, ACC and Big 12 counterparts'.Those modest rankings for the Trojans, Hawkeyes, Wolverines and Huskies make their paths to the playoff fairly clear; they will likely need to win out and finish the regular season at 10-2 in order to clinch a berth.\n\n    \n                                        \n    USC TrojansUSC and Iowa will sort themselves out because they go head-to-head on Nov. 15 in what will be a de facto playoff elimination game. From there, the road gets even trickier for the Trojans as they must also get past No. 9 Oregon and do so in Autzen Stadium. With victories over the Hawkeyes and Ducks, USC would likely be one of the most accomplished two-loss teams in the country. Of course, Lincoln Riley's crew must first take care of business Friday against Northwestern and finish things off on Nov. 29 with a rivalry win over UCLA.\n    \n                                        \n    Iowa HawkeyesThe rubber meets the road this week for Iowa, which hosts Oregon at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS. Kinnick Stadium already proved daunting for one playoff hopeful in No. 2 Indiana, which played its worst game of the year in a narrow 20-15 win over the Hawkeyes in September. If the Hawkeyes spring a trap for the Ducks, the only things standing between them and their first trip to the CFP would be tricky road games at USC and Nebraska and a home date with Michigan State. A splashy win over the Ducks may also give them margin for error down the line as a potential three-loss playoff hopeful.\n    \n                                        \n    Michigan WolverinesWith all due respect to Northwestern and Maryland, whom the Wolverines face in their next two outings, there is only one real résumé-building opportunity remaining on Michigan's schedule: the regular-season finale against No. 1 Ohio State. The Wolverines will be betting underdogs when their bitter rivals visit Ann Arbor, but if the last four years taught the college football world anything, it is to throw expectations out the window for The Game. Sherrone Moore seemingly has Ohio State's number, and this year he duels with Ryan Day's Buckeyes at home. A fifth-straight win in the series would be the cherry on top of a 10-2 season, which almost certainly gets Michigan into the field.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Washington HuskiesWashington might be the sneakiest CFP contender nobody is talking about. The Huskies' 3-2 conference record has them sitting in the middle of the pack on the Big Ten leaderboard, but in a few weeks' time, they could be much closer to the top. They project as comfortable favorites over Wisconsin, Purdue and UCLA, and if they scorch through that stretch, they will set up a monumental rivalry battle with Oregon on their home turf. It would be a de facto play-in game for Jedd Fisch, who could then become the third different coach to take Washington to the playoff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        'Thursday Night Football' gets back to a divisional matchup in NFL Week 10 as the Las Vegas Raiders will visit the Denver Broncos at 8:15 p.m. ET. Rookie running backs Ashton Jeanty and RJ Harvey could factor into an NFL SGP considering their early success thus far, while one of last year's top rookies in Brock Bowers will as well after hitting all of the Overs with his prop bets last week. Bowers posted a 12-127-3 stat line, catching three of Geno Smith's four touchdown passes. A Thursday Night Football SGP could also consider vets like Courtland Sutton and J.K. Dobbins as they face Vegas' No. 23 scoring defense.Meanwhile, Denver has an elite defense that is top five in both points allowed and yards allowed. The Broncos held Bowers to just four grabs for 38 yards when he last faced them, and the star TE has an NFL props bar of 69.5 yards and 6.5 receptions for Thursday. Knowing how Denver is defending tight ends this year would help inform you as to which side of this Thursday Night Football prop you should side with.

He has also gone over his touchdowns props bar in four of his last five games when favored.The Raiders' defensive strength is versus the ground game, as just six teams allow fewer yards per rush than Vegas. However, the Raiders are just 21st versus the pass, and only six defenses have fewer sacks than Las Vegas. That indicates Denver will lean more on an aerial attack come Thursday as Nix is projected to have 2.7 passing touchdowns.

    "body": "\n        Former NBA player and coach Damon Jones pleaded not guilty on two charges stemming from his alleged involvement in an illegal gambling scandal, per CBS News. Jones was then released on a $200,000 bond, and he is prohibited from gambling or making contact with organized crime as part of the bond terms.Jones is facing charges in two cases. One of them involves an allegation that he provided insider information to a co-conspirator, who then used that data to bet on NBA games. The second case involves Jones allegedly luring other athletes into rigged poker games organized by the mafia with Jones accused of taking a cut of the money as compensation for his role.In the first case, Jones allegedly sent a text to a co-conspirator on Feb. 9, 2023, in which he says, \"Get a big bet on Milwaukee before the information is out! [Player 3] is out tonight.\" As it happened, LeBron James missed the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Bucks that night.The other indictment accuses Jones, along with Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, of serving as a \"face card\" for rigged poker games set up by the mafia. Former players like Jones and Billups would lure in players, and the venue would feature X-ray tables, rigged shuffling machines, and glasses designed to see marked cards.\nMiami Heat player Terry Rozier was also caught up in this scandal, and he is accused of passing along insider information to help co-conspirators bet on NBA games. At this time, neither Billups nor Rozier have entered a plea. They are set to appear in court on Nov. 24.Billups, the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, has been suspended while the legal process plays out. Tiago Splitter is serving as the interim in his place.Rozier has also been suspended without pay, but the NBPA is challenging it. In a statement to ESPN, the NBPA said a suspension without pay is \"counter to the presumption of innocence and inconsistent with the terms of our collective bargaining agreement.\"\nOne day before Jones entered his not guilty pleas, NBA officials met with congressional staffers to discuss the gambling scandals and the league's ties with sportsbooks, per the Associated Press.\n            ",

County issued a warrant for the arrest of former NFL star wide receiver Antonio Brown for attempted murder with a firearm, the Super Bowl-winning pass catcher is in custody. Police say Brown was extradited from Dubai to the United States to face trial, according to the Miami Herald. Brown was involved in a May 16 altercation following a celebrity boxing event in Miami. Several videos from the incident circulated on social media, as well as pictures of Brown in handcuffs. Brown claimed police detained him, but released him that same night. Brown claims on social media that he was \"jumped by multiple individuals\" who tried to steal his jewelry, \"and cause physical harm to me.\" He even said that he would speak to attorneys about pressing charges on the individuals that allegedly assaulted him.However, one month later, a warrant obtained by The Washington Post stated that police received video footage showing Brown punching a man, and then appearing to take the gun of a security officer and run towards the individual. Two gunshots were then heard. The alleged victim in this case told investigators that a bullet possibly grazed his neck, and that he went to a local hospital to be treated. According to the warrant, patrons in the parking lot told police that Brown was the shooter.\nBrown, who turned 37 in July, last played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021, and was a member of the Super Bowl LV team. Regarded as one of the best wide receivers of the 2010s, Brown earned First Team All-Pro status four times, and made seven Pro Bowls. Brown starred for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010-18, and led the league in receptions and receiving yards twice, and receiving touchdowns once.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 offseason in Major League Baseball is fully underway, which means we're gradually ticking off the dates on our offseason calendar. That also means a steady supply of rumors, most of which center on free agency and trades (along with the occasional hiring and firing). Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's supply just below. DePodesta in line for Rockies jobThe Colorado Rockies are still in search of a manager for 2026, but more fundamentally they're also in need of a lead decision-maker atop baseball operations. On that front, Paul DePodesta, the former Dodgers general manager and current exec for the NFL's Cleveland Browns, will be named to the post, according to The Athletic. The 52-year-old DePodesta, who first rose to prominence while working under Billy Beane with the Moneyball-era Oakland A's, was at the helm for the Dodgers for the 2004 and 2005 seasons before being dismissed. Then came front-office stints with the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. Since early 2016, he's served as chief strategy officer for the Browns. The Rockies have logged seven straight losing seasons and in 2025 endured one of the worst seasons in MLB history with a record of 43-119. Along the way, they were outscored by more than 400 runs. Those depths prompted an ongoing effort to modernize the front office. In early October, general manager Bill Schmidt resigned his post after 26 years in the organization. The Rockies have not hired a lead executive from outside the organization for the first time since 1999, but DePodesta is poised to change that. \nO's kick off free agency with Taveras signingIt's not a major signing, but it is indeed pairing of team and free agent, which means the offseason has arrived in earnest. The Orioles have reached an agreement with veteran outfielder Leody Taveras on a contract, reports MLB.com.\nTaveras, 27, is a switch-hitter who can play center and has some speed on the bases. For his career, he has an OPS+ of 84 across parts of six MLB seasons with the Rangers and Mariners. He's likely to fill the fourth outfielder role in Baltimore for 2026. \nMattingly eyeing managerial vacancies?Don Mattingly is leaving his post as the Blue Jays' bench coach coming off the team's World Series loss to the Dodgers, the team announced Thursday. The motivation isn't retirement but rather Mattingly's possible pursuit of a different job, according to the New York Post. At the time of the report, two remaining managerial vacancies remained, though the Padres have since hired former reliever Craig Stammen. The Rockies are still in need of a manager for 2026. Mattingly boasts plenty of managerial experience, as he previously skippered the Dodgers and then Marlins for a total of 12 seasons. Over that span, Mattingly amassed a record of 889-950 (.483) in the dugout and led the Dodgers to three straight division titles and the Marlins to a postseason berth during the abbreviated 2020 season.\n            ",

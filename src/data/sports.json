    "body": "\n        An in-state rivalry is set to renew when the Michigan Wolverines take on the Michigan State Spartans on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Wolverines are 5-2 in their last seven games against the Spartans, but Michigan is just 4-12-1 against the spread in its past 17 meetings against Michigan State. According to the latest college football odds at DraftKings, Michigan is favored by 14 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 47.5. SportsLine's model is backing Michigan to go on the road and cover against its in-state rivals on Saturday night, making the Wolverines one of the model's Saturday best bets at DraftKings. New users can take advantage of the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.The model also sees value in backing a pair of Overs, playing Over 49.5 points in an SEC top 25 showdown between No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 20 LSU at 7:30 p.m. ET, as well as Over 44.5 points in Oregon vs. Wisconsin at 7 p.m. ET for Saturday's best bets at DraftKings. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past seven seasons. The model enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. It also went 24-11 (69%) on top-rated NBA against-the-spread picks last season. It enters the 2025 World Series a profitable 35-29 on top-rated MLB money-line picks this season.

The Wolverines are 3-1 in the Big Ten this season, and as has been the case in the majority of recent years, they have one of the best defenses in the nation. Michigan ranks 14th in scoring defense (17 points per game allowed) and 16th in yards allowed (308.3 per game). Meanwhile, Michigan State has lost four straight games, all in Big Ten play. Each of those losses has been by more than 10 points, losing by an average of 18.8 ppg. The model projects Michigan to cover in 64% of simulations. Back Michigan at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Wisconsin vs. Oregon: Over 44.5 pointsNo. 6 Oregon once again has one of the best offenses in the country, averaging 41.7 ppg this season, which ranks third, to nearly go Over this number by its own typical game alone. The Ducks are coming off a 56-10 win over Rutgers last week behind 290 passing yards and four touchdowns by Dante Moore and 125 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 11.4 yards per carry by Noah Whittington. Oregon is also third in the nation in yards, averaging 505 yards per game. Meanwhile, Wisconsin has allowed at least 34 points in back-to-back games and is allowing 32 ppg over its last five contests. Oregon may be able to reach this Over by itself, and if Wisconsin finds the end zone just once or twice, this game could easily reach 45 points. The model projects the Over to hit in 61% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Texas A&M vs. LSU: Over 49.5 pointsNo. 3 Texas A&M and No. 20 LSU have two of the top-five passers in the SEC, with Texas A&M sophomore Marcel Reed throwing for 1,770 yards and 15 touchdowns and LSU fifth-year senior Garrett Nussmeier having 1,638 yards and 11 touchdowns. The Aggies have the No. 15 scoring offense at 36.1 ppg this season, and their last two games both hit the Over, while the Over is 5-2 in Texas A&M games this year. The Over hit last week for LSU for just the second time this season as the Tigers allowed 31 points to Vanderbilt. Nussmeier was one of the preseason favorites to win the Heisman Trophy after throwing for more than 4,000 yards last season, so although LSU is currently outside the top 100 in scoring offenses, he can lead the Tigers to huge totals any given Saturday. The model projects the Over to hit in 64% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more college football picks?You've seen the model's Saturday best bets.

UFC 321 was meant to mend a long period of inactivity for the new undisputed heavyweight champion. Instead, an accidental eye poke brought Saturday's main event with Ciryl Gane to a frustrating end.Aspinall, who graduated to undisputed champion after Jon Jones vacated the title in June, was looking forward to an active title reign after being benched for most of the last two years. On Saturday, things got off to a rough start and only got worse. Challenger Gane overdelivered as an underdog, getting the better of Aspinall in the first round. Aspinall never got the chance to get going after an errant eye poke in the final 30 seconds rendered Aspinall unable to compete, leading to a no contest.Saturday's pay-per-view also crowned a new women's strawweight champion. Mackenzie Dern, empowered by her daughter cagside, cinched her second win over Virna Jandiroba to win the title vacated by Zhang Weili.Plus, Umar Nurmagomedov may not have put together the dominant showing that UFC CEO Dana White wanted, but he did pick up an important win over Mario Bautista. Nurmagomedov had to navigate some troubled waters with Bautista attempting a deep submission early and then leading a big knee late. But the prodigy of cousin Khabib Nurmagomedov did just that in a unanimous decision in which he swept the judges' scorecards. He likely awaits the winner of champion Merab Dvalishvili and Petr Yan after they meet in December.\nCBS Sports was with you throughout fight week with the latest news,  in-depth features, and betting advice to consider.

    "body": "\n        Making Week 8 Fantasy football picks will be harder than any other week, thus far, with six teams on byes. Those players who've been riding the bench all year on your team may finally see the light of day and get inserted into Week 8 Fantasy football lineups. Players like Chase Brown, Chris Olave, Romeo Doubs and Pat Freiermuth have been inconsistent this year but are coming off huge outings. Even Joe Flacco, with his 342-yard, 3-touchdown performance last Thursday, is now part of Fantasy football start/sit decisions for the week ahead.How should you handle Commanders skill players with Jayden Daniel (hamstring) ruled out, along with assorted injuries to Terry McLaurin (quad) and Deebo Samuel (heel)? And how should you handle players on the Ravens now that Lamar Jackson (hamstring) has been ruled out? Before making your Week 8 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 8 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 8 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking.

Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 8 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 8 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 8: The model is fading Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who has an over/under of 22.5 completions. Prescott sits third amongst quarterbacks in Fantasy points, thanks to 13 touchdowns versus zero picks over the last four weeks. However, none of those defenses match up with the Broncos unit he will face on Sunday, as only Houston has allowed fewer Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks than Denver.Denver ranks first in sacks, allows the lowest completion percentage and has allowed the second-fewest passing scores on the year. The one spot where it is vulnerable versus quarterbacks is the run game as mobile QBs like Daniel Jones and Jaxson Dart have rushing touchdowns versus Denver. However, a litany of injuries has made Prescott a stationary quarterback who ranks 25th at the position in rushing yards (56). Thus, Prescott may not warrant a spot in Week 8 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 12 in QB rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Panthers receiver Tetairoa McMillan. The No. 8 overall pick has had an inconsistent rookie year as he had 100 yards in Week 2 and a two-touchdown outing in Week 6, but he has no other games with either a touchdown or more than 73 yards. McMillan enters Week 8 ranking 27th amongst wideouts in Fantasy points in both standard and PPR leagues.However, he and Carolina will face a Buffalo defense on Sunday which has fallen apart in recent weeks. The Bills gave up just 125.8 passing yards over their first four games but then allowed an average of 250 yards over their last two. Both Stefon Diggs and Drake London had 140-plus receiving yards over the last two weeks versus Buffalo, and six of the seven passing scores the team has allowed have been to wideouts. McMillan slots among the top 12 in positional Fantasy rankings for Week 8, making him a WR1 in 12-team leagues.

    "body": "\n        No. 15 Missouri lost starting quarterback Beau Pribula to a left ankle injury early in the third quarter of its 17-10 loss to No. 10 Vanderbilt on Saturday. Sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz the injury will cost Pribula at least the rest of the regular season, with further testing to come on Sunday. Following the game, Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz told reporters that Pribula's ankle \"had to be popped back in.\"\"Beau has no broken bones but he did have an ankle injury that had to be popped back in,\" Drinkwitz said. \"Don't have a timetable for his return but it could be a while.\"With the game tied 3-3, Pribula got bent up on a fourth-down rushing attempt near the goal line when the pile of bodies pushed back on top of him as the Vanderbilt defense stacked him up. Pribula stayed down on the field in pain as the rest of the two teams left the field. He was tended to by medical staff and quickly put into an air cast before being carted to the tunnel where the broadcast showed him being transferred to a wheelchair to be taken to the back. \nPribula's injury forced the Tigers to turn to true freshman Matt Zollers, who began the season as the third-string quarterback. After losing Sam Horn for the season to an injury in the opener, Zollers became the backup and had to take over for the Tigers in a hostile road environment in a game with College Football Playoff implications. Both the Tigers and Commodores entered Saturday at 6-1 overall with 2-1 marks in SEC play.  Pribula, a Penn State transfer, was 9-of-14 for 68 yards passing and added 10 yards on four carries rushing prior to the injury in a defensive battle in Nashville. For the season, Pribula entered Saturday having completed 70% of his passes for 1,617 yards, 11 touchdowns and seven interceptions, adding 210 yards and five touchdowns on the ground for the Tigers. Zollers, a four-star, top 100 recruit in the class of 2025, received only a few snaps this season prior to Saturday, completing all six of his attempts for 75 yards and a touchdown. In his first series, Zollers looked solid, completing 4-of-6 passes for 27 yards including a key completion on fourth and 4, but the drive stalled in the red zone and Missouri hit the upright on a short field goal to keep the game tied. \nWhile Missouri eventually lost 17-10, Zollers finished the game with completions on 14 of his 23 passing attempts for 138 yards and one touchdown. \"I was really proud of him. I thought he did an excellent job,\" Drinkwitz said of Zollers. \"Obviously, the one turnover on a mesh read, but other than that, I though he played really big. Fourth-down conversions to give us a chance and then when they took the lead, to drive the ball down and score was really impressive. Moment wasn't too big for him.\"That performance from Zollers might raise the spirits some of the Missouri faithful, but seeing Pribula go down with an injury that will cost him the remainder of the Tigers' regular season puts a significant damper on the excitement of what has been a fantastic first half of the 2025 season. The Tigers, now 6-2 overall and 2-2 in SEC play, enter an off week before hosting No. 3 Texas A&M on Nov. 8.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 22 Texas battled back from a 17-point deficit and scored 24 points in the fourth quarter to eke out a 45-38 overtime win on the road against Mississippi State. Saturday's result represents the Longhorns' largest comeback win since they erased a 21-point deficit in 2007 against Oklahoma State. This is also just the second time in program history that Texas has won multiple overtime games in a season. The Longhorns survived a similar scare against Kentucky in Week 8. Texas trailed 38-21 with 10 minutes left to play in the fourth quarter after Mississippi State quarterback Blake Shapen connected with running back Davon Booth for a 62-yard touchdown. That's when the Longhorns took over. They answered with a quick nine-play, 75-yard scoring drive capped by a 21-yard scoring connection between quarterback Arch Manning and wide receiver Emmett Mosley V. The defense forced a quick three-and-out and then the offense again moved the ball with some ease, allowing kicker Mason Shipley to hit on a 26-yard field goal that cut Mississippi State's lead to 38-31. \nInstead of taking time off the clock, Mississippi State again went three-and-out. The Bulldogs then made the poor decision to punt the ball to Texas' Ryan Niblett, who made them pay taking the boot 79 yards for the game-tying touchdown with 1:47 left on the clock. Niblett was also Texas' hero against Kentucky, as he returned two punts for a total of 88 yards that allowed the Longhorns to score some key points. He also returned a punt for a touchdown in a win over Oklahoma two weeks earlier.\nMississippi State got painfully close to field goal range at the end of regulation. Shapen fumbled a would-be pass attempt on third-and-6, though, which forced the Bulldogs to punt with less than 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter. \nTexas faced further adversity in overtime when Manning exited the game after his head bounced off of the turf. He was slow to get up and went straight to the medical tent with the help of Texas' team trainers. That just meant it was backup Matthew Caldwell's opportunity to play hero. On his second snap from scrimmage, Caldwell lofted a beautiful pass to Mosley, who made an equally impressive snag to get one foot down in the end zone and hand the Longhorns a touchdown on the first possession of the extra period. From there, Texas' defense locked the game down. Mississippi State was eventually forced into a fourth-and-20 after a pair of procedural penalties and Shapen was sacked for a loss of 32 yards by Ethan Burke to end a desperation conversion attempt. \nThough he got knocked out of the game late, Manning played the best game of his career to preserve Texas' season. He completed 29 passes for a career-high 346 yards and three touchdowns. He also rushed for a touchdown. With the win, Texas advanced to 6-2 on the season with a 3-1 record in SEC play. The Longhorns face another huge test next week as No. 10 Vanderbilt, which beat No. 15 Missouri in Week 9, comes to town. \n            ",

Manning scrambled for a 13-yard gain on the play and was met by a defender when going down. Manning was shown walking off the field with trainers and going into the medical tent. Texas coach Steve Sarkisian had no update on Manning's status after the game.Following Manning's exit, Matthew Caldwell entered the game and threw what proved to be the winning touchdown pass -- a 10-yard strike to Emmett Mosley V. The Texas defense then got the stop it needed on the subsequent possession to get out of Starkville with a 45-38 win. Manning was banged up earlier in the game as well. He walked off the field and into the medical tent following a first-quarter touchdown run but was able to come back in the game on the following drive. The No. 22 Longhorns trailed by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter, but Manning helped lead his team back. The biggest play of the game came on special teams, however. Texas tied the game at 38 and sent the game to overtime after Ryan Niblett returned a kick 79 yards with 1:47 to play in the fourth. The Longhorns then won it in overtime to 6-2 overall and 3-1 in SEC play. It was Texas' second straight overtime road victory. The Longhorns beat Kentucky 16-13 last week. \nManning was having a career day before exiting the game. The former No. 1 overall recruit in the 2023 recruiting cycle by 247Sports completed 29 of 46 attempts for 346 yards and three touchdowns, and also added a 3-yard rushing touchdown on the ground to open the scoring for the Longhorns.\n            \n    ",

After a deflating end to Tom Aspinall vs. Ciryl Gane at UFC 321, Pereira reminded everyone how he can inject life into the land of giants.Pereira kept a close eye on Saturday's main event, a fight that disappointingly ended in a no contest after Aspinall suffered an eye poke in Round 1. Gane was overdelivering as the underdog before the fight-ending foul occurred. In response to the fight, Pereira offered to \"make the heavyweight division great again.\" Three emojis -- a stone face, a bone and a white house -- accompanied the caption, denoting Pereira's desire to fight Jon Jones at the White House. Pereira has been petitioning to fight Jones at next year's card set to take place at The White House, which President Donald Trump previously announced would take place on June 14, ever since reclaiming the light heavyweight title from Magomed Ankalaev earlier this month. Pereira wants to move up to heavyweight for a potential Jones fight, one he called a \"super fight\" while rejecting the idea of fighting Aspinall.\n\nUFC CEO Dana White is lukewarm on Pereira moving up to heavyweight. He also previously said there was a \"billion to one\" odds he'd book Jones for the White House card. Jones continues campaigning for the fight and accepted Pereira's callout on Saturday.\n\"Alex, I'd be down to bring the highest skill level to the White House,\" Jones wrote on Twitter. \"I appreciate the respect you showed. Let's dance.\"\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        EAST HARTFORD, Conn. – The U.S. women's national team are undeniably in a period of transition both by necessity and by design, a natural pro",
    "body": "\n        EAST HARTFORD, Conn. – The U.S. women's national team are undeniably in a period of transition both by necessity and by design, a natural product of the international calendar allotting them two years of friendlies before the Women's World Cup qualification tournament and almost three years until the big event itself. Thursday's 2-1 loss to Portugal, though, was a surprising embodiment of that very fact, unrecognizable to head coach Emma Hayes' eye in a disjointed outing that marks her biggest setback since taking the job more than a year ago. As the USWNT prepare to face Portugal for a second time in three days, though, time is on their side again – in the opposite sense.\"I think there's no time to be negative but how do you take learnings in, obviously, very quickly and try to apply,\" defender Emily Sonnett said on Saturday, the day before their next friendly. \"Having the short turnaround allows us to basically layer in [learnings], have the film sessions and hopefully turn around in two days' time and put something together.\"There were several takeaways from Hayes' third loss in her 25-game stint in charge of the team, some the head coach was quick to point out on Thursday. That was the USWNT's first game in 113 days and for the nine players who are part of this month's games but were not on the roster for the team's friendlies in June and July, the time away from the group was even longer. The disconnection was clear as Portugal scored twice on set pieces, outdoing their 0.85 expected goals tally by capitalizing on the lack of chemistry between a defensive group that had its fair share of veterans and newcomers. It created a discordant game state for the attack, especially as the U.S. went down 2-1 with 18 minutes plus stoppage time left on the clock.How to watch USWNT vs. PortugalDate: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Pratt and Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field -- East Hartford, Conn.TV: TNT \"I think to keep the ball more,\" midfielder Lily Yohannes, who came on in the 70th minute, said about the instructions she received as she entered Thursday's match. \"It was a bit chaotic at times and I think we didn't dominate possession how we would've liked to so coming on, just trying to keep the ball more for the team. Obviously, once they scored, it became a bit chaotic, [the] ball was going out a lot and a lot of long balls and whatnot, so we just tried to push it to the end and get a result.\"\nHow Hayes solves the midfield issue, as well as the attack's underwhelming results, will be a point of intrigue on Sunday as the USWNT get a re-do against Portugal. Thursday's starting trio in attack failed to break through Portugal's organized defensive block, Alyssa Thompson generating just 0.12 xG from three shots while Catarina Macario took one shot worth 0.08 xG and Michelle Cooper failed to take a single shot. The good news for Hayes is that even as disappointing as the performance was on Thursday, it does little to disrupt the adjustment period she has designed for a fresh new group of players. Just seven members of the roster that won Olympic gold in Paris last year are currently with the team, creating a learning curve that Hayes is bothered by.\"Teaching is the part of my job that I enjoy the most so whether we win, whether we lose, whether we play well, we don't play well, the teaching part is the consistent part,\" Hayes said, revealing that she broke the team up into small groups to go over film from Thursday's match. \"We had three really good meetings this morning after a travel day yesterday.\"The quick turnaround before facing the same opponent allows the USWNT to put those lessons into motion, Hayes taking a practical approach about one performance in a friendly roughly two years before a World Cup.\n\"You can feel multiple things all at once,\" Hayes said. \"Of course, we are disappointed but we are extremely optimistic because we don't want to get to a major qualifying game and there becomes a situation that we haven't faced and I felt that there were challenges in that game that we haven't faced yet so I'm really pleased we get the chance to address those things. Second of all, we're a great team and as I keep reminding the players, whenever things get challenging, lean into the team in every way, shape or form, whether that's the game model, whether that's outside of the field. Let's lean into each other and I've said before, healthy culture, great people always is going to represent great progress.\"Eva Gaetino earns promotion from U-23sHayes, always with one eye on the future, made the call to bring defender Eva Gaetino into the fold for both Sunday's match against Portugal and Wednesday's against New Zealand in Kansas City, another signal of the unique role the U-23 national team plays in her plans for the World Cup. The U-23s now regularly hold concurrent camps with the senior team, the latest taking place last week in the Philadelphia suburbs before Thursday's defeat to Portugal, with Gaetino earning a promotion after Hayes observed multiple days of training.\"Eva's a great example of what happens to you when you're doing the things you're doing when no one's watching,\" Hayes said about the Paris Saint-Germain center back. \"She had things to work on within her game. She's been working on those things and, in the U-23 environment, was the standout player. Now, granted, I say this to all of our players – don't assume that just because you're next in line that you're going to get that step up. You have to earn the right to play in this team. You have earned the right for the opportunities here and she deserves that opportunity.\"\nHayes poured cold water on the idea that Gaetino could start against Portugal on Sunday since the team had a travel day on Friday and only trained Saturday before their next friendly, an inadequate amount of time for a fresh face to integrate into the team. The head coach also shot down the notion that Gatino earned the promotion because she stands at 5'11\", making her one of the taller members of the squad this month.\"I think with regards to height, being great in the air has nothing to do with height,\" Hayes said. \"It's all about timing and timing for us as a team was off [on Thursday], not regarding the back four.\"Even if the 22-year-old Gaetino plays a limited role on the field over the next two games, Sonnett said there is an inherent value to a player in the early stages of their international career.\n\"I was actually a player that did a [U]-23's and I got to come up with the full team. I think it was maybe like 15 minutes but it's still one of my best memories,\" Sonnet said. \"I think it's great 'cause you have access and they can see how the environment is it just comes down to how you're creating a bigger player pool and having learnings across not only the first team but the U-23s and so on.\"Gaetino's inclusion on the senior team's roster, though, offers a reminder that the USWNT are still in the middle of their evolution under Hayes both from a tactical and personnel standpoint, as the head coach aims to collect as much information on her team before next November's World Cup qualification tournament.\"I'm still, quite rightly, working through where our players are in those stages but I'll say it again – I want to learn these things now,\" Hayes said. \"I made it clear I wanted to play with Avery [Patterson] at left back to see if she could do that. I want to be clear, I want to look at different situations to be able to see where the players are leveling up and I'd much rather have the situation that happened the other night happen now and learn what we learned than do that in 12 months' time, though, let me be clear, learning never stops and with development.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Texas Longhorns made history as the first Texas team to earn the AP Poll's preseason No. 1 ranking, but Steve Sarkisian's bunch has not lived up to those expectations. That's led to some frustration in Austin, and on Saturday, hours before Texas was set to go on the road to face Mississippi State, a report emerged that Sarkisian was interested in a move to the NFL and potentially the Tennessee Titans' vacancy. That rumor got quickly shut down by Sarkisian's agent, but it was an indicator that both sides might be looking to the future in Austin. That's a major change from earlier this year when Sarkisian got another pay bump at Texas, making him one of the nation's five highest-paid coaches. After a 5-2 start and some struggles with Mississippi State on the road, it begged the question: what would it cost for either side to get out of their current deal? Steve Sarkisian contract, buyout detailsIncluding his $10.8 million salary this season, Sarkisian's contract pays him $75.8 million through the 2031 season. As part of his new deal, not only did he get a pay bump but his buyout jumped from 70% of what he was owed to 85%, which is a significant and important change. That meant coming into this season his buyout jumped to $64.4 million, and  if they decided to fire him during the year, USA Today cites his buyout for December 1 as being $60.3 million. \nIf Texas were to fire him after this season but before 2026, he would be owed $55.25 million. That is an awful lot of money, but it would not be the most we've seen paid by a team in the state of Texas, as Texas A&M paid Jimbo Fisher $75 million to leave College Station not long ago. As for Sarkisian's reported interest in jumping to the NFL, it's hard to imagine him getting paid in line with his current deal at Texas, either in annual money or contract length. On top of that, his original contract stated that he would owe to Texas $4 million if he left before the end of the 2025 season, with that figure dropping to $3 million to leave before the end of the 2026 season. \nIt seems unlikely an NFL team would jump at paying that much on top of what it would cost to bring Sarkisian from the college ranks to the pros. Texas, meanwhile, would have to be willing to pay one of the biggest buyouts in history to get rid of Sarkisian, but if there is any program in the country that could come up with $55+ million (depending on the timing of firing him), it would be the Longhorns.  \n            ",

Mackenzie Dern has spent her entire mixed martial arts career maturing in the spotlight. On Saturday, her ever-evolving striking game lifted her to a pivotal win over Virna Jandiroba at UFC 321.Dern made her MMA debut in 2016 after wrapping up a decorated Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu career. An unrefined prospect with fantastic submissions, Dern's limitations were a constant point of criticism in the past. Under the tutelage of renowned striking coach Jason Parillo, Dern leaned on her improved striking to win the vacant UFC women's strawweight title in a competitive scrap. Dern slightly outstruck Jandiroba while generally landing the more damaging blows. Though Jandiroba scored multiple takedowns, she wasn't able to do much with them. Both women were bruised and banged up after the fight, the consequences of a primarily striking war of attrition. The final scorecards read 48-47, 48-47, and 49-46 in favor of Dern. \"It feels amazing. I can't believe this happened...\" Dern told UFC  commentator Daniel Cormier during her post-fight interview. \"It wasn't  the fight I expected. I thought it'd be easier.\"  \nDern found herself in a favorable position fighting for the title. With Zhang Weili vacating the title, there weren't many suitable options for a vacant title fight. Zhang and Jandiroba had beaten most of the contenders ranked above Dern, plus Dern had a 2020 win over Jandiroba. The win over Jandiroba was Dern's third straight win, a significant comeback after losing consecutive fights for the first time in her career.An emotional Dern celebrated her crowning achievement by placing the UFC title over the shoulder of her young daughter, noting that she's never lost a fight with her daughter in attendance. \nWhile Dern is the undisputed champion, there's a spiritual asterisk to it. Dominant champion Zhang vacated the belt to challenge women's flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 322. Should Zhang return to strawweight after the November pay-per-view, many would deem her the uncrowned champion coming back to reclaim her throne. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Give an older, wiser Lane Kiffin credit for how he's handling a tricky situation that can distract and frustrate even the most focused of college football coaches. With speculation already swirling about Florida's interest in Kiffin, No. 8 Ole Miss went on the road and beat No. 13 Oklahoma 34-26 in Norman. The Rebels showed impressive resiliency late after letting a 22-10 halftime lead dissolve into a 1-point Oklahoma lead headed into the fourth quarter. It's another marquee win for Ole Miss and has the Rebels primed to make the College Football Playoff if they can take care of business the final month of the season. Not only would that be a dream come true for Ole Miss fans who have emotionally and financially supported the Rebels' football renaissance, but it could make it even more likely Kiffin stays in Oxford. All that now stands between Ole Miss and a playoff berth is: a 3-4 South Carolina team, FCS opponent The Citadel, a Florida program that already fired coach Billy Napier and in-state rival Mississippi State that has yet to win an SEC game under Jeff Lebby. Anything can happen in the SEC, as Lane learned a year ago when Florida and Kentucky tripped up a really good Ole Miss team. This year, though, there's no excuse to miss the playoff now. \nHere's why Lane's win over Oklahoma was so huge: If Ole Miss now makes the CFP, as it should, those first-round games begin Dec. 19. Critically, that's two weeks after the early signing period of Dec. 4-6. If Ole Miss were to win that first playoff game that could be played in Oxford, it would then have a quarterfinal game either Dec. 31 or Jan. 1. Why is that important? There's now only one transfer portal window this cycle, and it runs from Jan. 2-16. If you had to wait until Jan 1 or later to make a hire, it could put you way behind the 8-ball on putting together not only a high school recruiting class but a transfer group. For Lane, who has been dubbed the \"Portal King,\" that would be especially challenging. With the way fan patience is now, especially in the SEC, you can't just waive away a first recruiting class either the way you might have been able to in the past. Indiana's Curt Cignetti has shown what can be done in Year 1, and every program is chasing it now. Would a program be willing to wait until after a coach is done in the CFP? No school was willing to do it a year ago, and there is considerable skepticism one would want to unless it's entirely unavoidable. It'd be awfully risky as no coach is going to want to commit to a new school while he's still competing for a national championship. Kiffin desperately wants to win a national championship one day -- it will drive any decision he makes -- and has learned from past mistakes to give the Rebels the best chance to do so this season. \n\n        \n            \n                Florida's first call should be Lane Kiffin. The tea leaves say he's intrigued\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nConsider how he handled Auburn's interest back in 2022. Auburn fired Bryan Harsin on Halloween -- not too dissimilar from what Florida just did last Sunday in firing Billy Napier -- and didn't hide its interest in the Ole Miss coach. It hung over everything Lane and Ole Miss seemed to do as he seriously considered making the switch to another SEC school. And as the now famous story goes, had his daughter Landry not convinced him otherwise, Kiffin likely would have become Auburn's coach. Whether it was his fault or not, Auburn's interest in Kiffin cast a pall over Ole Miss. What started as a 7-0 season finished with a whimper when the Rebels lost their last four games of the season and ended 8-5. The whole situation frustrated Ole Miss administrators and boosters that he wouldn't tamp down the speculation and a dream season went up in smoke. This time around, Kiffin decided he needed to break from his usual strategy and address the coaching rumors with his team. As he explained on SEC Network Saturday morning, he told his team the interest in him was a result of the team's success. \n\"That's a product of having a program with a lot of players and coaches doing a really good job,\" Kiffin said he told his players. \"I wouldn't even mention it because they've been through it every year for probably four years in a row, but we have so many players, I just told them, 'hey, guys, this is what happens around here because we win games and people like the style that we play in.'\"Kiffin is never going to make a \"I'll never leave here\" proclamation during the season the way Ole Miss fans would love to hear. He's said publicly he doesn't want to get involved in contract negotiations during the season despite Ole Miss AD Keith Carter expressing interest in getting something done before things got crazy with the coaching carousel. While it'd make everyone sleep easier at night if Kiffin agreed to a massive new deal the way Cignetti and Indiana just did, it's likely not coming during the season. But the best thing Lane can do for himself personally and for Ole Miss is just keep winning. It'll make Florida boosters want him even more, but it helps the home team's cause. \nThe more Kiffin feels like he can legitimately win a national championship in Oxford, the more likely he is to say no to every option that comes his way. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The availability of Baltimore Ravens superstar Lamar Jackson has come under scrutiny in the days leading up to the team's Week 8 game against the Chicago Bears. The situation prompted the organization to clarify its Friday injury report, which initially listed Jackson, who has been sidelined for weeks with a hamstring injury, as a full participant before changing him to limited, and then downgraded him from \"questionable\" for Sunday's game to \"out.\" \"Lamar Jackson was present for and participated fully in our entire Friday practice ahead of Sunday's game against the Bears,\" the Ravens said Saturday. \"Upon further evaluation today and after conferring with the league office, because Lamar didn't take starter reps in practice, we updated our report to reflect his practice participation.\"That statement won't do much to quell suspicion, and an NFL spokesperson said the league plans to look into the matter further. \n        \n            \n                Baltimore's extraordinary pivot on Lamar Jackson injury report sure to draw league scrutiny\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson participated in Friday's practice with the scout team, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones, but the change in the injury report is what's garnering attention. The injury report policy is written as a \"cornerstone of public confidence in the NFL.\" \n\"The credibility of the NFL, teams, owners and team personnel requires full compliance with and uniform enforcement of the policy,\" the injury report policy reads. Jones further reported that Jackson was listed as a full participant because he was at the entirety of Friday's practice. Until Saturday morning, that was believed to be Jackson's first full practice since leaving the Week 4 game against the Chiefs with a hamstring injury that has now forced him out of three games. \nEither way, Tyler Huntley, recently signed off the practice squad, will start as Jackson remains sidelined. Cooper Rush started the team's previous two games without Jackson but struggled. Baltimore currently sits at 1-5 and is last in the AFC North after beginning the 2025 season with Super Bowl aspirations. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        North Carolina coach Bill Belichick will head to Halloween still searching for his first victory over a Power Four opponent after the Tar Heels fell 17-16 in overtime to No. 16 Virginia on Saturday. The loss dropped North Carolina to 2-5 (0-3 ACC). The victories are against 1-7 Charlotte and Richmond, which is an FCS program.Bleak as the results have been for the six-time Super Bowl champion, UNC actually demonstrated some progress against Virginia, which made the outcome even more painful. North Carolina's defense pitched a shutout in the second half, and the offense showed signs of life.But in his first taste of collegiate overtime, Belichick's big gamble backfired. UNC answered a Cavaliers touchdown in the extra period and opted to go for a game-deciding 2-point conversion. Tar Heels quarterback Gio Lopez rolled out and hit Benjamin Hall in the flat. Hall reached for the pylon but was just stopped just short, sealing UNC's fate as a 17-16 loser.\nPredicting how UNC's Belichick experiment would go was a fool's errand. But even the most ardent of detractors would have been hard-pressed to forecast failure of this magnitude. Up next is a quick turnaround to play at Syracuse on Friday night in Week 9. All five of UNC's remaining games are at least somewhat winnable. But a coach who authored a 2025 book entitled \"The Art of Winning\" has mastered the art of losing in college football.\nPerhaps if there's a sequel, it should be written by second-year Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer. After losing on the road against a pair of unranked teams in his first season, DeBoer appeared to be on the cusp of another such loss on Saturday. But after falling behind 22-14 amid a dreadful offensive start to the second half, the No. 4 Crimson Tide rallied for a 29-22 win at South Carolina.It was Bama's seventh straight win since a season-opening loss at Florida State, and it improved Alabama to 3-0 this season in one-possession games. DeBoer's squad has come up with clutch plays repeatedly during its 5-0 start to SEC play. Here is the full rundown of winners and losers from a loaded Week 9 of college football action.\nWinner: Vanderbilt deliversAfter reaching a top 10 ranking in the AP poll for the first time since 1947, there was a lot on the line for No. 10 Vanderbilt as it hosted No. 17 Missouri. With ESPN's College Gameday in town for the first time since 2008, the Commodores were under an unusually bright spotlight and in need of a win to legitimize their CFP candidacy.It was anything but comfortable, but Vandy got the job done in a 17-10 win. The Commodores needed a goal-line stand, a missed chip-shot field goal from Missouri and a replay review on the final play of the game. But after all that, they escaped with another marquee victory to reach 7-1 (3-1 SEC). It's the program's best start since 1941.\nLoser: South Carolina collapsesEvery loss for a South Carolina program that began the season ranked No. 13 has been painful. But Saturday's 29-22 loss against No. 4 Alabama was worse than painful. It was agonizing. The Gamecocks (3-5, 1-5) took a 22-14 lead with 10 minutes remaining. But after forcing three consecutive three-and-outs in the third quarter, South Carolina's defense folded with the game on the line. The Gamecocks' offense also did its part in the collapse with a fumble at the 1:39 mark that gifted Alabama excellent field position for its go-ahead score.\nLoser: The end zone eludes North CarolinaGetting the football safely into the end zone is proving to be a tall task for North Carolina under first-year coach Bill Belichick. A week after a crushing fumble at the goal-line cost UNC in a loss at Cal, the scene played out again Saturday in the Tar Heels' 17-16 overtime loss to No. 16 Virginia. North Carolina was on the cusp of taking a 7-0 lead when Kobe Paysour fumbled while reaching for the pylon. The result was a touchback and a harbinger of things to come. UNC quarterback Gio Lopez was intercepted twice inside Virginia's 10-yard line with the game tied at 10 in the second half. Then, in overtime, the Cavaliers stopped North Carolina's potential game-winning 2-point conversion attempt just inches short.\nWinner: Memphis roars backThrough three quarters, Memphis had totaled 229 yards and trailed No. 18 South Florida 31-17 in a critical American battle. Then came a fourth quarter that Tigers fans will remember for a long time. Memphis totaled 221 yards in the final frame while outscoring the Bulls 17-0 en route to a thrilling 34-31 win. A week after suffering a stunning loss at UAB, the Tigers (7-1, 3-1 AAC) desperately needed a win to keep their conference title and CFP hopes alive. They got it when USF kicker Nico Gramatica's potential game-tying field goal sailed left as time expired. The Tigers are now 11-0 at home over the past two seasons and 2-1 this season in games they've trailed by 14 or more. South Florida (6-2, 3-1) isn't done yet, but the Bulls have plenty of competition from within their own league in the race to claim the Group of Six's CFP spot.\nLoser: Mississippi State's misery continuesThe only fan base in greater misery than South Carolina's on Saturday may have been Mississippi State's. The Bulldogs led No. 22 Texas 38-21 in the fourth quarter before collapsing late and falling 45-38 in overtime. A win would have snapped a 15-game SEC losing streak for the Bulldogs, who haven't won a league game since 2023. It would have been just their second league win since the death of coach Mike Leach in 2022.What's worse is that it was Mississippi State's second overtime home loss of the season against a ranked league foe after the Bulldogs fell in similarly painful fashion against Tennessee last month. Last week, the Bulldogs committed a gut-wrenching turnover while driving for a potential game-winning field goal at Florida. This team is far more competitive in coach Jeff Lebby's second season than it was last year, and it did win a thriller against reigning Big 12 champion Arizona State in Week 2. But when it comes to toppling SEC foes, the lid is still on.\nWinner: Iowa explodes (sort of)Iowa is on the short list of teams that can score 40 points while totaling just 13 first downs and 274 yards of offense. That's exactly what the Hawkeyes did in a 41-3 beatdown of Minnesota. The Hawkeyes scored touchdowns on special teams (punt return), defense (pick six) and, yes, they even scored three offensive touchdowns. It was a vintage performance for the Hawkeyes, who have quietly reached 6-2 (4-1 Big Ten) ahead of next week's visit from No. 6 Oregon.\nWinner: Nebraska gets bowl eligibleBowl eligibility used to be viewed as a foregone conclusion at Nebraska. But after seven straight losing seasons from 2017-23, it's a feat worth acknowledging. Saturday's 28-21 win over Northwestern was no piece of art, but it got the Cornhuskers bowl eligible for a second straight season with plenty of time to spare. Third-year coach Matt Rhule's future remains a source of significant uncertainty amid the head coaching vacancy at his alma mater, Penn State. Whether he stays or goes, Rhule has clearly elevated Nebraska (6-2, 3-2 Big Ten) back to a level of respectability that had eluded it for the past decade. Close games like this one used to be contests the Cornhuskers would find a way to lose.\nWinner: Haynes King for HeismanHaynes King's Heisman Trophy campaign picked up steam in No. 7 Georgia Tech's 41-16 win over Syracuse. So did the No. 7 Yellow Jackets' chances of finishing unbeaten in ACC play for the first time since 1990. King completed 14 straight passes at one point, totaled 395 total yards and finished with five touchdowns (including two as a runner). The sixth-year senior leads the ACC in rushing touchdowns with 12 and is captaining the charge for one of two ACC schools yet to register a league loss. At 8-0 (5-0 ACC), Tech's odds of reaching the CFP are increasing by the week.\nWinner: Wake Forest beats win totalYou could hear the thud of Connor Calvert's foot striking the football as he unleashed his attempt at a career-long 50-yard field goal. With Wake Forest trailing SMU 12-10 in the final seconds, the Demon Deacons needed a heroic boot from their redshirt freshman kicker. He delivered in legendary fashion with a bomb that meandered around the raised hands of an SMU defender and cleared the crossbar with inches to spare. It made for a wild ending to a strong contender for ugliest game of the day. \nThe Demon Deacons committed five turnovers but squeaked out a 13-12 win, thanks to Calvert's memorable kick. At 5-2 (2-2 ACC), Wake Forest has surpassed the preseason win total of 4.5 that it was assigned by Las Vegas prior to coach Jake Dickert's first season. With five games left to play, that's not too shabby.\nLoser: Oklahoma's murderer's row beginsNo. 13 Oklahoma entered its SEC showdown with No. 8 Ole Miss leading the nation in total defense, allowing just 213 yards per game. The Sooners ranked No. 2 in scoring defense and No. 3 in third-down defense. But the Rebels offense is significantly better than any the Sooners faced during their first seven games, and OU was exposed in a 34-26 loss. The Rebels (7-1, 4-1 SEC) dominated time of possession by more than 10 minutes and allowed just one sack. The Sooners (6-2, 2-2) still produced 14 tackles for loss, but they never forced a turnover. Things will only get tougher from here. OU faces four more top-20 SEC foes to close the season.\nWinner: Cincinnati's defense deliversNo. 21 Cincinnati isn't known for its passing defense, which made a visit from Baylor particularly interesting. Bears quarterback Sawyer Robertson entered leading the nation in passing yards per game at 339.4. Pitted against a Bearcats' defense ranked 93rd in passing yards allowed, Robertson was probably licking his chops. But Cincy delivered by holding Robertson to a season-low 137 passing yards in a 41-20 win. Offensively, the Bearcats ran wild by totaling 265 yards on the ground, which helped them dominate time of possession, thus keeping the football out of Robertson's hands.\nWinner: Mason Heintschel goes wildPitt freshman Mason Heintschel was ranked the No. 43 quarterback in the Class of 2025 by 247Sports and chose the Panthers over programs like Akron, Bowling Green and Coastal Carolina. But if his past four games are any indication, there may soon be a bidding war for the former unheralded prospect. Heintschel set a Pitt freshman record with 423 passing yards in the Panthers' 53-34 drubbing of NC State. He is the first ACC freshman in the last 30 years to throw for 400 yards and three touchdowns in a game, according to the ACC Network. The Panthers (6-2, 4-1) are now 4-0 since Heintschel took over the starting job.\nLoser: Kansas' rivalry woes continueKansas entered its Sunflower Showdown rivalry game against Kansas State as a three-point favorite. The Jayhawks had home-field advantage and the perfect opportunity to snap a 16-game losing streak in the series. It wasn't to be. KU's hopes of claiming the Governor's Cup for the first time since 2008 died in the haze of four turnovers as Kansas State cruised to a 42-17 win. It hasn't been a storybook season for the Wildcats (4-4, 3-2 Big 12), but K-State has quietly won three of its last four entering a Nov. 1 home showdown with Texas Tech.\nLoser: UCLA's joyride crashes hardFollowing an 0-4 start and the firing of coach DeShaun Foster, UCLA went on quite a joyride, as the Bruins stunned Penn State and then beat Michigan State and Maryland. The feel-good surge finally came crashing to an end Saturday at No. 2 Indiana in a 56-6 loss. It was the Bruins' worst defeat since 2011 and tied for the program's second-largest margin of defeat since 1936. The Hoosiers (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten) gave no mercy to their overmatched West Coast visitors while earning their 14th straight home victory. Adding to IU's joy was that star quarterback Fernando Mendoza's brother, Alberto Mendoza, got in on the fun with a rushing touchdown.\n            ",

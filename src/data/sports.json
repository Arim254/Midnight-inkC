    "body": "\n        Outside of the Triple Crown, perhaps no horse race generates as much buzz as the Breeders' Cup Classic, with this year's running taking place on Saturday with a 6:25 p.m. ET post time. Del Mar Racetrack in the San Diego area will host the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic, which features nine of the best thoroughbreds competing over 1 1/4 miles. The Breeders' Cup weather is expected to be about perfect at around 65 degrees, likely creating a fast track. The field for this year's race is loaded, even with the scratch of Derby-Belmont double winner, Sovereignty. Among those still in the field are Preakness victor, Journalism, Travers Stakes champion, Fierceness and Sierra Leone, who enters the Breeders' Cup Classic 2025 as the defending winner.Users can jump on the latest TwinSpires promo code CBSSPORTS to receive up to $400 in bonus bets to wager on almost any track:Horses aged 3 and older can compete in this race, which allows Sierra Leone to seek back-to-back wins. Fierceness is the 5-2 favorite, per the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic odds, with Sierra Leone and the Japan-based Forever Young both at 7-2. Journalism is at 5-1 to utilize in horse racing bets, while even a 20-1 longshot like Nevada Beach can't be overlooked as he's trained by four-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner, Bob Baffert. With several of the world's best horses set to enter the starting gate, you'll want to see what SportsLine horse racing expert Jeff Hochman has to say before making any 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic picks or horse racing predictions.Hochman has shown a profit in 22 of the past 39 Triple Crown races. One example of his best picks was Big Brown in the 2008 Kentucky Derby at odds of 2-1. More recently, he swept the 2022 Triple Crown, capped off by Mo Donegal's easy win in the Belmont Stakes. In 2023, he cashed the Preakness with National Treasure. In 2024, he successfully tabbed Straight No Chaser to win, place and show in the Grade 2 Santa Anita Sprint Championship at odds of 3-2.\nHochman delivered exceptional handicapping results during the summer 2025 racing season at two of the country's premier tracks, Saratoga and Del Mar. His combined 65.7% win rate across the two tracks represents elite-level performance that significantly exceeds industry benchmarks for professional handicappers. Anyone who has followed him on betting apps like TwinSpires and 1/ST BET could have been way up, even more if they used the latest TwinSpires offer code or 1/ST BET promo code.For the Breeders' Cup World Championships, Hochman has handicapped the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic field, made his picks, and constructed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.Top 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic predictionsOne of Hochman's surprising Breeders' Cup Classic 2025 picks: He is high on Journalism (5-1), despite not being one of the top three favorites. The horse has placed either first or second in each of his last nine starts, including winning both the Preakness and the Haskell Stakes. He finished as runner-up at both the Kentucky Derby and Belmont, but the horse who beat him in those starts, Sovereignty, is no longer in the Breeders' Cup Classic field.\nThat brightens Journalism's prospects for Saturday, as does the recent jockey change from Umberto Rispoli to Jose Ortiz. While the former led the horse to lots of success, he has zero wins across 18 starts at the Breeders' Cup World Championships. Meanwhile, Ortiz has six victories at the series, including prevailing at the Breeders' Cup Mile last year. With the upgrade at jockey, and with his chief competition being scratched from this race, Journalism shouldn't be overlooked with Breeders' Cup Classic bets. See which horses to back here.New users can target the 1/ST BET promo code 500BET which offers up to $500 in wagering credits for the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic:How to make 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic   bets, picksInstead, Hochman's top pick is a horse who is \"truly elite.\" He's also high on a double-digit longshot who \"enters on an upward trajectory\" and who he classifies as a \"dangerous outsider.\" Hochman is sharing who he likes, along with his top 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic   picks, over at SportsLine.\nWhich horse wins the Breeders' Cup Classic 2025, and how should you construct your wagers?

Davis finished with four points, four rebounds and a steal and did not return after being ruled out for the remainder of the game at halftime.\n\"He tried to return -- didn't want to take any chances,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd told reporters after the game against the Pacers. \"We'll see how he feels moving forward.\"Coming into the game against the Pacers, Davis was listed as probable on the injury report because of bilateral Achilles tendinopathy. Davis, the centerpiece of the trade that sent Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, appeared in just nine games with his new team after being traded.\nDavis is averaging 20.8 points, 10.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 29.8 minutes per game. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Texas quarterback Arch Manning is trending in the right direction ahead of the No. 20 Longhorns' Week 10 matchup with No. 9 Vanderbilt. Manning was removed from the Longhorns' player availability report on Friday, indicating that the redshirt sophomore is good to go against the Commodores.Texas coach Steve Sarkisian told ESPN's Molly McGrath that Manning has not experienced any setbacks or symptoms this week, and is expected to meet with doctors Saturday morning for a final evaluation before kickoff. Texas listed him as questionable on its official injury report after he returned to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday.Sarkisian said Monday that Manning was in concussion protocol after exiting Saturday's 45-38 win over Mississippi State after his helmet made contact with the turf at the end of a 13-yard scramble.Manning knifed his way through the heart of Mississippi State's defense in overtime with the score tied at 38 before he was tackled by Bulldogs safety Isaac Smith and defensive lineman Kedrick Bingley-Jones, who hit him from behind.\nManning tried to get up with the help of Texas offensive tackle Brandon Baker before motioning for trainers from a seated position on the turf. Matthew Caldwell, Manning's backup, threw a 10-yard touchdown pass on the possession to Emmett Mosley V that was the eventual game-winning score.\n        \n            \n                Who is Texas QB Matthew Caldwell? How the Longhorns' offense will look if Arch Manning is unavailable\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nManning had previously led a 17-point comeback in the fourth quarter to force overtime on the road after the Longhorns trailed 38-21. Texas is the first SEC team to overcome a 17-point deficit in the final frame to win since 2013.Manning finished with his best game as a collegian, completing 29 of 46 attempts for 346 yards and three touchdowns to go along with a score on the ground.\nHow does concussion protocol work?According to the university's concussion management plan, post-concussion management is directed by the team physician and the need for initial physical and cognitive rest will be determined based on individual serial assessments, concussion history, modifying factors and specific needs of the student-athlete.Final authority for \"return to play\" resides with the Longhorns' team physician. The NCAA's concussion safety protocol management mandates Manning would need to be cleared by medical personnel before returning to play. At 6-2 overall and 3-1 in conference play, Texas enters a pivotal final stretch beginning with next weekend's tilt against the 10th-ranked Commodores at DKR-Texas Memorial Stadium. Sarkisian's team is off the following week before traveling to fifth-ranked Georgia, hosting Arkansas and then entertaining the SEC's lone unbeaten, Texas A&M, in the regular-season finale on Nov. 28.\nWinning out from here would not only guarantee a third consecutive playoff appearance for the Longhorns, but would but a ticket to Atlanta in the SEC Championship Game.\n            ",

Coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday that Purdy will not start in Week 9 but that he could be available if the 49ers need him to jump into action. Mac Jones will line up to take the starting reps once again.Shanahan on Monday expressed some optimism that Purdy could be back in the lineup on Sunday but said that the team would wait for more information throughout the week. Purdy was a limited participant in practice all week.Purdy initially injured the toe in Week 1 but was able to return for Week 4 -- only to re-aggravate the injury. So what does Purdy need to show in order to return to the field? Shanahan said it's confidence. \"If he gets out there, and he's hobbling around and stuff, he won't be out there [on Sunday]. So he's got to go out there and go through the practices and stuff and really let us know how good he feels because it's hard to know what's going on with the toe,\" Shanahan told reporters. \"They're really iffy things. Last time, we felt like he was feeling pretty good, looked pretty good in practice and then in the game, one hit and it set him back five or six weeks, whatever this has been ... four weeks.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 9 injury report: Lamar Jackson good to go for Ravens, Bryce Young returns to practice\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe team wants Purdy, who signed a five-year, $265 million extension in May, to avoid another setback, but Shanahan noted it's not easy to detect whether one is coming.\n\"It's kind of a sensitive situation and hopefully getting some reps in practice and stuff will give him that confidence that it's better than it was last time,\" Shanahan said. When asked if Purdy will let them know by the end of the week if he feels good enough to play, Shanahan quipped, \"I mean, I didn't give him a deadline.\"\"It's not as black and white as you guys want it to be\" the coach added.\nJones is dealing with a knee contusion but was a full participant in this week's practices. He will get yet another start as the 49ers (5-3) look to bounce back from last week's 26-15 loss to the Houston Texans. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The LSU athletic director job is open after the university parted ways with Scott Woodward, and it is a tremendously attractive position. One name off the Tigers' potential candidates list, however, is Georgia athletic director Josh Brooks. An intraconference move is off the table for Brooks, who publicly declined interest in the job at one of the SEC's premier destinations.Brooks emerged as a possible option for the Tigers given that he completed his undergraduate degree at LSU and began his administrative career inside state lines at Louisiana-Monroe. His ties to Georgia, however, are also deep. He received a graduate degree from the university and has been on staff in various roles for much of his professional career.\"Georgia fans -- with success often comes speculation, but I want to address it directly,\" Brooks said on social media. \"I have not been contacted by anyone at LSU, and more importantly, I have no interest in any other job. My full focus remains on the University of Georgia, our student-athletes, coaches, staff and fans.\"LSU is a perennial national championship contender in multiple sports, including football, in which it is one of just two schools this century -- along with Ohio State -- to win multiple national championships with different coaches. That makes the athletic director job one of the best in the country.\nThe Tigers are not only in search of a new athletic director but are also set to hire a football coach after the firing of Brian Kelly. Interim athletic director Verge Ausberry and the LSU Board of Supervisors will oversee the coaching search.\"I am very fortunate to work alongside President Morehead, the Athletic Association Board, Governor Brian Kemp, and the Board of Regents, who share a deep commitment to excellence and to the success of Georgia Athletics,\" Brooks said. \"This is home to me, and I'm honored to play a part in the incredible progress we've made together. The best days for Georgia Athletics are still ahead, and I look forward to continuing to build on the championship standard we've established here in Athens. Let's go have some fun in Jacksonville! Go Dawgs!\"\nBrooks has a terrific job of his own at Georgia. The Bulldogs' football program won back-to-back national championships in his first two years in the athletic director role, giving him a roaring start to his tenure. He previously served in multiple administrative roles in Athens, first joining the football program in 2008 as director of football operations and working his way up the athletic department ladder from 2016 onward.\n            ",

The Dodgers won Game 6 Friday night, tying the series once again. The winner on Saturday takes home the World Series trophy. The loser leaves empty-handed.The Dodgers are trying to become the first back-to-back World Series champions since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees. The Blue Jays are looking for their first title since back-to-back wins in 1992 and 1993.The Jays punched their ticket to the Fall Classic with an ALCS Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners. This is Toronto's first World Series appearance since 1993, when they won their second consecutive title. The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series. They are the first defending champion to reach the World Series the next season since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies, and, in more than a few ways, this year's Dodgers are better than last year's.The Blue Jays (94-68) have home-field advantage over the Dodgers (93-69) in the World Series because they had the better regular-season record.

UNC entered this weekend 0-5 against Power Four competition and was coming off back-to-back devastating losses in ACC play against Cal and Virginia, where Belichick's team had a chance to win the game in the final moments.The highlight of Belichick's tenure at UNC thus far -- and a culmination of his team showing gradual improvement throughout the course of the season -- was on display when the Tar Heels snapped their four-game losing skid against the Orange. It was also the first time UNC scored at least 21 points against a Power Four team this season.North Carolina quarterback Gio Lopez finished 15 of 19 for 216 yards and two touchdowns. The Tar Heels trailed 10-6 at halftime before scoring 21 unanswered points in the second half to pull away for good. UNC racked up 425 yards of total offense and held Syracuse to just 147.\nThe Belichick era at UNC began with a blowout loss against TCU before the long-time New England Patriots coach secured his first win at the college level against Charlotte. UNC lost its last two games against Cal and Virginia by four points combined. Against Cal, UNC had a chance to take the lead in the final minutes before fumbling at the goal line. In the game against the Virginia, UNC was unable to convert on a 2-point conversion that would've given Belichick's team a walk-off win.Despite moving to 3-5 (1-3 ACC), North Carolina and Belichick still face an uphill climb to become bowl eligible. The Tar Heels face Stanford next at home and close out the season with games against Wake Forest, Duke and NC State. \nNorth Carolina will need to win at least three of its five four games to avoid missing a bowl game for the first time since 2018.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In honor of Halloween, Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell peeled back the curtain on some of his past costumes and revealed one particularly hilarious getup. Campbell, a burly former tight end, told reporters at the Lions facility on Friday that, one year, he dressed up as Marilyn Monroe for the holiday.The Monroe costume was a joint venture of sorts with Campell's wife, Holly. Campbell said that on one Halloween during his NFL playing career, his wife supplied him with a white dress to go with his blonde wig, and all together, the ensemble resembled the late actress.\"That was a long time ago, and that wasn't here,\" said Campbell, who played for the Lions from 2006-08. \"I'm sure you can find some old stuff. But anyway, we paired up pretty good. Let's just put it that way. Holly's the creative one. She always had pretty good ideas for stuff.\"After Campbell's media availability session, Holly Campbell took to social media to provide photo evidence of the costume.\n\n\nIt was not a coordinated costume for the couple, though. Campbell went solo on the Monroe outfit while his wife donned a halo and angel wings.\"It was really more her and her sister than it was we were paired up,\" Campbell said. \"I was kind of the odd one out. But I was Marilyn Monroe. She bought me the freaking dress. I had the wig. Actually, I had a broken ankle, so I was on crutches, too. That was great.\"As for how Campbell plans to celebrate Halloween this year, he said he will be passing out candy at his home. Reese's peanut butter cups and M&M's are the candy of choice in the Campbell household.\nCampbell will lead the Lions into battle against the Minnesota Vikings on the other side of Halloween. Detroit, second in the NFC North at 5-2, hosts Minnesota at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday.\n            ",

Yahoo Sports reported that the raise that Lashlee will receive will make him one of the top-10 highest-paid coaches in the sport.Lashlee, 42, guided SMU to the College Football Playoff and an appearance in the ACC title game during the 2024 campaign. Lashlee has been with the program since the 2022 season and has compiled a 34-15 record at the school. The Mustangs are currently 5-3 heading into a showdown against No. 10 Miami on Saturday.Lashlee was connected to the Arkansas job shortly after the program fired Sam Pittman earlier this month. The former Arkansas quarterback has ties to the school, making him a logical candidate for the position. However, when asked about upcoming job openings, Lashlee quickly shot down the rumors.\n\"I don't stand anywhere on speculation and hypotheticals,\" Lashlee said earlier this month. \"I'm happy, I've got a great job. I think when your name gets linked to jobs it means your team has done well, the program has done well. So it's a compliment to what our staff and administration and players have built over the last three-plus years. Then a lot of times there's obvious connections. If it's your alma mater, it's easy to link names. But I haven't given it any thought because there hasn't been anything to give thought to. It's a great, fair question. But I'm really excited with what we're building here.\"SMU rewarded Lashlee with a new contract last fall that previously tied him to the school through the 2030 season.\nLashlee is the latest coach to sign an extension with his school, rather than potentially joining the coaching carousel. Nebraska and Matt Rhule agreed on an extension earlier this week, while Indiana secured a long-term deal with coach Curt Cignetti to keep him with the program.\n            \n    ",

Kevin Gausman had just one bad inning, but that was all it took for the Dodgers' win.The series so far has been a back-and-forth affair. The Blue Jays won Game 5 behind a record-setting Trey Yesavage start and back-to-back home runs to lead off the game, and Game 4 before that by beating Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers took a wild Game 3 on a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run in the 18th inning Monday. Yoshinobu Yamamoto tossed a complete game in Los Angeles' Game 2 win, while the Blue Jays won Game 1 in an 11-4 blowout, including a grand slam by Addison Barger as part of a nine-run sixth inning.The Dodgers are back in the World Series for the second year in a row, looking to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers last week and had a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, took a tougher route through the ALCS but came out victorious in Game 7 against the Seattle Mariners.

The Nichols Hills Police Department said officers responded around 7:45 p.m. to a report of a burglary at a residence in a north suburb of Oklahoma City. When officers arrived, the suspects had already fled the area and no one was inside the home at the time.Police said no arrests have been made and did not disclose whether any property was stolen.The break-in occurred as Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning NBA MVP, was at the Paycom Center in downtown Oklahoma City, where the Thunder defeated the Wizards, 127-108. A heavy police presence was seen in the neighborhood for several hours as investigators searched the property and Thunder general manager Sam Presti was spotted at the scene Thursday night, according to KWTV.\nPolice said there is no indication the incident poses a broader threat to the community but noted that patrols will be stepped up in the neighborhood through Halloween weekend and beyond.Property records reviewed by The Oklahoman show the home associated with Gilgeous-Alexander is valued at nearly $4 million.\nGilgeous-Alexander scored a game-high 31 points in the win for the reigning NBA champion Thunder, which improved to 6-0 on the season. Oklahoma City is back on the court against the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday at 3:30 p.m. ET.\n            \n    ",

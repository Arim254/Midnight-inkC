The model is backing two teams who have high expectations but look significantly different from last season, projecting the Mavericks to win and cover as 2.5-point favorites in Cooper Flagg's debut, as well as the Celtics to win and cover in their season-opener without Jayson Tatum (Achilles) as 3.5-point favorites against the 76ers in the latest NBA odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. The model is also backing New Mexico State to cover as 1.5-point underdogs against Missouri State on CBS Sports Network in college football action in its Wednesday best bets at DraftKings. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past seven seasons. The model enters the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 160-118 roll on all top-rated NBA picks, returning nearly $4,000. It also went 24-11 (69%) on top-rated NBA against-the-spread picks last season. It is also a profitable 42-30 combined on money-line and over/under college football picks since the beginning of 2024. Anyone following its NBA betting advice or college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Wednesday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookCeltics (-4.5) vs. 76ers (-115)Mavericks (-3.5) vs. Spurs (-115)New Mexico State (+1.5) vs. Missouri State (-118)Combining the model's three picks into a Wednesday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +559 (risk $100 to win $559). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nCeltics (-4.5) vs. 76ers (-115)For the first time since he was drafted with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, the Boston Celtics will be starting a season without Jayson Tatum, and the 2025-26 Celtics better get used to it. The six-time All-Star tore his Achilles in the Eastern Conference semifinals last year, meaning he'll be out either all or nearly all of the regular season. But the Celtics, who have won more than 50 games in each of the last four seasons, are more than a one-man show, and with Derrick White and Payton Pritchard at guards under head coach Joe Mazzulla, the model predicts a strong start for Boston against a 76ers team that went 24-58 last season. Jaylen Brown (hamstring) is questionable for Wednesday, as he'll take on the go-to role all season. Paul George (knee) is out for the 76ers. The model projects the Celtics to cover in 62% of simulations at home. Back the Celtics at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Mavericks (-3.5) vs. Spurs (-102)The Cooper Flagg era is set to begin in Dallas on Wednesday as one of the most hyped No. 1 overall picks in recent NBA Draft history makes his debut. Flagg, a 6-foot-9 forward who can also play like a guard, is surrounded by plenty of talent as well, including Anthony Davis, D'Angelo Russell and Klay Thompson, so he won't have as much pressure on him as many other high-profile No. 1 overall picks do early in their careers. The bouncing lottery balls went Dallas' way after last season, when the Mavericks ended up with the top pick after just barely missing the postseason, going 39-43 and making the NBA Play-In Tournament. The Spurs, however, are coming off a 34-48 season, including 13-27 on the road. Dallas is home Wednesday, and the model projects the Mavericks to cover the spread in 68% of simulations. Back the Mavericks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:New Mexico State (+1.5) vs. Missouri State (-118)The Aggies are underdogs for the third time in four home games this season, yet they are 3-0 on their home field this season. New Mexico State is 0-3 on the road, but its road struggles won't matter on Wednesday. New Mexico State had no problems as a 1.5-point underdog in Conference USA play at home against Sam Houston, winning 37-10 on Oct. 2. Missouri State is coming off a 22-20 victory over a Middle Tennessee team that is winless in Conference USA play. New Mexico State senior quarterback Logan Fife is averaging 252.3 passing yards per game this season, and Missouri State ranks 110th in passing yards allowed this season. The model predicts New Mexico State to cover the spread in 70% of simulations on CBS Sports Network. Back New Mexico State at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more NBA picks and college football picks?You've seen the model's Wednesday best bets.

Both of those teams were on the precipice of winning a title when she took over -- Phoenix won in her first year and New York in her third -- but now Brondello will take on an extremely different challenge with the expansion Tempo. \n\n        \n            \n                Adam Silver says WNBA players will get 'big increase' in compensation as CBA negotiations continue\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Golden State Valkyries set the bar extremely high for the new franchises coming into the WNBA in this latest round of expansion, becoming the first team in league history to reach the playoffs in their inaugural season. That'll be difficult to match for Toronto, but Brondello will be able to help guide the franchise into building the kind of roster and culture that's necessary for contending in the long term. When the Tempo will get a chance to start building that roster is still unknown, as they are at the mercy of the ongoing CBA negotiations. The new expansion draft rules will be set in that new collective bargaining agreement, and with reports indicating the two sides aren't particularly close to a deal with the Oct. 31 deadline rapidly approaching, Toronto will likely be waiting a good bit longer before they get to start adding players officially. \nIn the meantime, Brondello and Tempo general manager Monica Wright Rogers can begin working out the kinds of players they want to target in an expansion draft and go through the many contingencies depending on what structure the league and WNBPA adopt for it. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With nearly 30 shots, a goal from Jude Bellingham and a victory, a quick glance would make it seem like Real Madrid's 1-0 win against Juventus in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday was a simple job well done as their near-perfect start to the season continues. The actual 90 minute experience, though, was a mixed bag for Los Blancos, who swapped efficiency for unevenness in a performance that was ultimately a balance of lucky and unlucky moments.The good news for Xabi Alonso's side is that the manager's personnel choices paid off, even if the reward felt like something out of Carlo Ancelotti's version of Real Madrid than the new look Alonso is trying to instill. Vinicius Junior has almost been relegated to a secondary role for Los Blancos these days as Alonso rotates through his options but in the moment the team finally broke through and bagged the game's lone goal, it was because Vinicius' individual brilliance was on full display. He did not receive credit for a goal or an assist but he did just about everything else, expertly outmaneuvering a handful of Juventus defenders and finding a hint of space to take a nearly perfect shot that ended up hitting the goalpost. Bellingham pounced to ensure Vinicius' work was not in vain, and that the most excellent moment of the match was not wasted.\nIt might be enough for Vinicius to regain his status as a central figure in Real Madrid's attack in time for Sunday's Clasico, even if the honor of being the focal point has been reserved for Kylian Mbappe. His growing habit of turning up when Los Blancos need him most, though, is an important antidote to the team's overall performance on Wednesday, which was especially drab in the first half.\nJuventus' defense managed to shut out Alonso's side completely before the break as Madrid put just four of their 14 shots on target, the hosts' star-studded attack stringing together very few meaningful chances. Between Madrid's 14 shots in the first half and Juventus' three, only two of those opportunities were taken from less than 10 yards away from the goal, the extremes of the visitors' game plan apparent in the fact that Eder Militao led Los Blancos' in shots in the first half with four.The performance only reinforced the need for Vinnicius' individual brilliance to break things up, though the openness of the second half was something Juventus provided to Real Madrid rather than the other way around. With the score 0-0 at the break, Igor Tudor's side changed their approach completely – they went from three shots and 0.08 expected goals in the first half to 10 shots in the second. Naturally, it was a set-up that favored Alonso's side – 14 second half shots is not much better than Juventus' 10 but Madrid generated 1.74 expected goals along the way while the visitors were limited to just 0.51. The scoreline only favored Juventus as much as it did because goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio managed several impressive saves in the second half. Madrid did need Thibaut Courtois' help in the early stages of the second half, though, the teams sharing good luck and bad even if they did not share the points.\nEven in the midst of an uninspiring performance, there is a hint of good news for Real Madrid in the short-term – there is no scenario in which Barcelona pose the same threat as Juventus, the high line a fixture of Hansi Flick's style of play no matter the downsides. Wednesday's narrow win, though, may have just provided a blueprint for different teams to cancel out Real Madrid's all-star attack and hope the risk of an uber-defensive approach pays off for them, even if it did not for the Italian side in the Champions League.\n            ",

Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe will take center stage once again as the focal point of Alonso's version of Los Blancos and already has 14 goals to show for it across all competitions, including five in the Champions League.Real Madrid are one of six teams with two wins out of two to start their Champions League campaigns, the group mostly made up of European titans – Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter and Arsenal – who hope to create further distance between them and the rest. The exception in that group, though, are Qarabag, who notched the first win for an Azerbaijani team in the history of the competition against Benfica and then followed that up with a victory over Copenhagen. Their next test will be against Athletic Club, last season's UEFA Europa League semifinalists who are off to a middling start in both domestic and continental play.For more ahead of a jam-packed Champions League week, here's what you need to know before tuning in.\nHow to watchAll of the action on Matchday 3 of the UEFA Champions League can be caught on Paramount+, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have select simultaneous coverage.

Kylian Mbappe is expected to lead Los Blancos' offense but Alonso will have a range of options in attack as he looks to fill out the lineup, though the most pressing question of all just might be whether or not Vinicius Junior starts. He got the nod in Real Madrid's 5-0 drubbing of Kairat on Matchday 2 but Alonso lived to regret the decision of leaving him on the bench in their win over Marseille on Matchday 1. The new manager is inclined to rotate through his options so perhaps the fact that Vinicius did not start on Sunday against Getafe means he could be in the lineup against Juventus. \nCan Liverpool turn things around?: Liverpool's strong start to the season is officially a thing of the past, with the Reds becoming the first Premier League champions in 11 years to go on a four game losing streak following their 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. How exactly manager Arne Slot corrects course – and whether or not he can do it in time for their trip to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League – is a big question, especially as it becomes clear that the team's tactical vision for the season is not really working. Their attack has been spotty in recent weeks, either ineffective or wasteful, and the individual players are a bit all over the place – Cody Gakpo has five goals in his last four games for club and country but Florian Wirtz is still struggling to make an impact and Mohamed Salah is off to a poor start. That's without considering the Reds' vulnerable defense, which has been just as costly all season long.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Khris Middleton has walked the tunnels of Fiserv Forum hundreds of times. But until he arrived for the Washington Wizards' shootaround on a gray and windy Wednesday morning, hours before the team's 2025-26 season opener against the Milwaukee Bucks, he had never done so as an opponent. Middleton, who admitted it felt \"weird\" to wake up in a hotel in Milwaukee, said he was \"reminiscing\" as he walked the familiar path to the court he once called home. \"Done great things in here, so it was definitely a moment I got to reflect on a little bit when I got here,\" Middleton said. \"Think about the good times, the bad times, the ups and downs, all of it.\"A second-round pick by the Detroit Pistons back in 2012, Middleton was traded to the Bucks ahead of his second season. At the time, he was considered something of a throw-in in the Brandon Knight for Brandon Jennings swap. Over the 11-plus seasons he spent in Milwaukee, he became much more than that. When the Bucks dealt him to the Wizards ahead of the deadline last season, he left as a franchise icon and one of the most beloved athletes in Milwaukee history. \n\"This place will always be special to me,\" Middleton said. \"I've said it many times: this organization helped me accomplish a lot of my dreams and my goals that I set.\"When Middleton arrived in Milwaukee, the Bucks hadn't won a playoff series since 2001, and were stuck toiling on the treadmill of mediocrity. Together with Giannis Antetokounmpo, he helped transform the franchise into a perennial contender, and in 2021 the duo led the Bucks to their first title since 1971. Middleton made three All-Star appearances with the Bucks and remains second in games played (735), third in points (12,586), seventh in rebounds (3,598), third in assists (2,990), fifth in steals (870) and first in 3-pointers (1,382) on the franchise's all-time leaderboard. \"First of all, I think the most important thing, he should get the warmest welcome ever,\" Antetokounmpo said earlier this week. \"When he comes here and he sees his tribute video, he should be in tears crying before this game. I cannot explain how much Khris means to this team. I cannot explain how much Khris means to me.\"\nThe Bucks' full plans to honor Middleton on Wednesday night remain unclear. At the very least, though, there will be a tribute video, which Middleton acknowledged will be \"hard\" to watch, especially in the middle of the game. His two main goals for the night are to see more Middleton jerseys in the crowd that Antetokounmpo jerseys -- \"I definitely would love to stick that to Giannis\" -- and to not become too emotional. \"I'm hoping I don't tear up, you never know,\" Middleton said. \"I know Giannis and a couple of guys over there would love to see that. I know [Bucks president] Peter Feigin would love to see that for sure. Hopefully I don't.\" There will be tears flowing inside Fiserv Forum on Wednesday whether Middleton joins in or not. He means that much to the organization, to the fanbase and to the city. Antetokounmpo is the better player and the bigger star, but the past decade of Bucks basketball belongs just as much to Middleton. \n\"I think that's what legacy is all about -- winning,\" Middleton said. \"We built this organization from a team that was struggling to a contender and eventually to a champion, and that's something that should always hold here in this building or wherever else they move is that we won a championship for the city.\"When Middleton first stepped out of the tunnel and on to the court on Wednesday morning, he said the first thing he went to look at was the championship banner hanging high up in the rafters. Years from now, whenever his career is done, he should be able to return and see his No. 22 right alongside it.  \"It's not up to me. It's up to the people that make that decision,\" Middleton said. \"But yeah, I hope to see that number up there one day. Not any time soon, but that would be great.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series will get underway on Friday night, when the Los Angeles Dodgers take on the Toronto Blue Jays. The Dodgers are looking to become MLB's first repeat champion in 25 years in what would serve as their third World Series win since 2020. The Blue Jays, conversely, are attempting to win their third title in franchise history, having previously won back-to-back championships in 1992-93.As part of CBS Sports' preview material, we asked our MLB staff for one bold prediction apiece. Do note that \"bold\" in this case does not mean something as (relatively) mundane as, say, Shohei Ohtani or Vladimir Guerrero Jr. recording a multi-homer game. No, these are supposed to be a little out there, a little aggressive. If you can't dream now, when can you?\nWith that in mind, let's have some fun together below.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2025 World Series bold predictionsR.J. Anderson: A walk-off ... caught stealing It's been 99 years since Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end a World Series on a busted hit-and-run play. Isn't baseball due for a sequel? Of course, neither of these teams is prone to running -- the Dodgers ranked 22nd in stolen bases during the regular season, the Blue Jays ranked 28th -- which is why I'll take this moment to remind everyone: \"bold\" is often another word for \"improbable.\" Maybe the Dodgers insert Justin Dean to pinch-run for Freddie Freeman or Will Smith, or maybe Toronto decides to send Myles Straw as part of a hit-and-run to leverage their high-contact ways. Whatever the case, my bold prediction is that one of the games in this series (and I hope there's seven in all) will end with a caught stealing.\nMike Axisa: The highest-scoring Fall Classic everI predict this will be one of the highest scoring World Series ever. It's two great offenses with a lot of power and also two shaky bullpens, which I figure means a lot of late-inning fireworks (good for impartial observers, bad for Blue Jays and Dodgers fans). Here are the highest scoring World Series:2002: 85 runs (Angels vs. Giants)1960: 82 runs (Pirates vs. Yankees)1997: 81 runs (Cleveland vs. Marlins)1993: 81 runs (Blue Jays vs. Phillies)1982: 72 runs (Brewers vs. Cardinals)The Dodgers' rotation could throw a wrench into this prediction, but that's what makes it bold, right? I think this will be only the fifth ever World Series with at least 80 runs scored between the two teams. If it goes the full seven games, that means we're talking at least 11.5 runs per game between the two teams.\n        \n            \n                World Series predictions: Expert picks for Dodgers vs. Blue Jays with MLB's Fall Classic finally set\n                \n                    Kate Feldman                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDayn Perry: The 27th out under further reviewI'll go with the MLB Doomsday Scenario being realized. By that I mean the final play of this World Series will be upheld on review. The result will be the same, but the celebration will be delayed while the review booth in New York has its look at things. The on-field call will stand as opposed to being confirmed, which will add a layer of ambiguity to it all. The awkwardness and the compromising of the championship moment will be subject to discourse and debate for much of the offseason in a most unwelcome manner. Ah well, such are the costs of doing business. \nMatt Snyder: A more conventional walk-offWe haven't had a walk-off clincher since 2001, when Luis Gonzalez singled up the middle against Mariano Rivera and the Yankees to seal the Diamondbacks' only World Series title. I've got the Dodgers in five, so let's say it happens again this year. In fact, of the 11 all-time series-clinching hits, only two have been home runs and I'll go with a third walk-off, World Series-clinching home run. Anyone remember the last one? Yep, it was the Blue Jays (Joe Carter in 1993; the other was Bill Mazeroski in 1960). This time, it'll come against the Blue Jays when the Dodgers walk the World Series off in Game 5 with a blast from Shohei Ohtani.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 NBA season brings significant fantasy basketball implications as multiple star players face extended absences. From Fred VanVleet's torn ACL to Tyrese Haliburton's devastating Finals injury, savvy fantasy managers have golden opportunities to uncover breakout candidates and waiver wire gems.When elite players go down, someone always steps up. This comprehensive injury report analyzes 10 major NBA injuries and identifies the players poised to deliver increased fantasy value. From Amen Thompson's starting role in Houston to Andrew Nembhard's opportunity in Indiana, these injury-driven situations could define your fantasy season.NBA Injury Updates: Fantasy Basketball Players to TargetFred VanVleet, Rockets - expected return: April 12, 2026VanVleet was diagnosed with a torn ACL late in the offseason, which quickly put a damper on some of the Rockets' hopes after their acquisition of Kevin Durant. The immediate thought for many was that Reed Sheppard would be thrust into the starting job, but there were also doubts about his ability to handle such a role, especially considering he has not shown much in his short time in the NBA. Nonetheless, he is certainly in line for a bit of a boost. On the other hand, Amen Thompson was selected to start at point guard for the squad on opening night. Thompson has proven that he can thrive in the facilitator role and will have a great chance to stuff the stat sheet from the point. Thompson's shift to point guard also opens up minutes throughout the lineup, which will likely benefit Steven Adams, Tari Eason, and Dorian Finney-Smith.Jayson Tatum, Celtics - expected return: April 1, 2026The league has had ample time to digest Tatum's injury, and the Celtics reacted by acquiring Anfernee Simons, who is another high-level scorer. Obviously, Tatum's absence opens up a major opportunity for Jaylen Brown to step up as the primary scorer, but Simons, Derrick White, and Payton Pritchard can also be expected to benefit. Additionally, Sam Hauser is in line to pick up a boost in playing time at the forward positions, which could result in him averaging over 10 points per game for the first time in his career. \nDamian Lillard, Trail Blazers - expected return: April 1, 2026Despite the foreknowledge that Lillard would likely miss the entire season, the Trail Blazers elected to bring back their former franchise star by signing him to a three-year deal in the offseason. The squad also parted ways with Anfernee Simons, but filled his spot with the acquisition of Jrue Holiday. The Trail Blazers maintain a wealth of depth in the backcourt with Holiday, Shaedon Sharpe, and Scoot Henderson, who will account for a large percentage of the squad's offense this season. In particular, Sharpe and Henderson have a chance to take their games to new heights. Tyrese Haliburton, Pacers - expected return: October 1, 2026Haliburton's injury in Game 7 of the 2024-25 NBA Finals was as devastating as it gets. However, as it goes, he and his team can only look forward, which means a major boost for Andrew Nembhard, who will take on the job of starting point guard. Perhaps an even greater increase in value will result from Bennedict Mathurin stepping into the role of starting shooting guard, which was left vacant by Nembhard moving to the point. Both players are ideally set up for major breakout seasons that should result in new highs across most of the board in their young careers. Scotty Pippen, Grizzlies - expected return: January 1, 2026Pippen was one of the league's most notable contributors from a bench role last season and also stepped up a few times to take the reins while Ja Morant was sidelined. His absence will be a significant one for the squad, but luckily, the Grizzlies picked up Ty Jerome in the offseason, who proved to be a standout contributor out of a backup point-guard role for the Cavaliers last season. Although Jerome (ankle) will be out for the first couple of weeks of the season, he will have an opportunity to jump into a key role upon his return, allowing him to build some momentum with his new team. Rookie Cedric Coward is also in line to pick up additional minutes in the absence of Pippen. \nTyler Herro, Heat - expected return: November 17, 2025Herro is not expected to be out for too long, but his absence will be significant enough that it will provide a great opportunity for Norman Powell to jump right into a lead offensive role for his new team. Pelle Larsson, Terry Rozier, Jaime Jaquez, and Nikola Jovic could each also pick up a sprinkling of extra playing time while Herro is out. Additionally, Andrew Wiggins will have to handle a larger responsibility as a leading offensive presence.Keegan Murray, Kings - expected return: November 30, 2025Murray is working his way back from a torn ligament in his left thumb, which leaves the Kings a bit thin in the frontcourt. The expectation is that they will shift some of their wing talent down, bringing DeMar DeRozan to power forward and Zach LaVine to small forward, which then opens up room for Keon Ellis to step into the starting shooting-guard spot. Second-year big man Isaac Jones, Doug McDermott, and Drew Eubanks could also see additional minutes in the frontcourt. LeBron James, Lakers - expected return: November 18, 2025James' start to the season will only be delayed by a few weeks, as the 40-year-old superstar is nursing a bit of sciatica. In his absence, the Lakers will likely utilize a bit more of their backcourt depth, with guys like Gabe Vincent and Marcus Smart being the first to benefit. Newly acquired Jake LaRavia is also in line for a boost, while Jarred Vanderbilt and Jaxson Hayes should see an uptick. Additionally, Austin Reaves becomes a much more prominent offensive option, while Rui Hachimura will have more room to make his mark. \nKyrie Irving, Mavericks - expected return: January 1, 2026Irving has been out since late last season, which has given the Mavs plenty of time to plan for his absence. Their main solution has been the acquisition of D'Angelo Russell, who gives them a more-than-capable playmaking and scoring option in the backcourt. Russell has a great opportunity to establish himself as a key contributor and ensure that he maintains a significant role even after Irving returns. Brandon Williams, Max Christie, and Dante Exum are also in line for more action to begin the season. Dejounte Murray, Pelicans - expected return: January 2, 2026Murray has been sidelined since late January 2025, with his absence being a key factor in the derailment of his team's previous campaign. However, the Pelicans acquired Jordan Poole in the offseason, who will take over the starting point-guard job to begin the 2025-26 season and has a great opportunity to flourish among a well-balanced lineup. Rookie Jeremiah Fears, Jordan Hawkins, and Jose Alvarado are also in line to handle more significant roles until Murray is back at full speed.\n            ",

Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for just 100 yards and tossed three interceptions before being replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers in the fourth quarter.One of the more glaring takeaways from Sunday's loss was the fact that Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle only was targeted four times and caught just one pass for 15 yards. On Wednesday, Tagovailoa revealed that his height kept him from being able to get the ball to his star wideout.\"Some of it has to do with being able to see guys ... I'm not the tallest guy in the back there either,\" said Tagovailoa who stands 6-foot-1. \"So being able to see and then sometimes when that happens, you don't want to just throw it blindly, and you gotta progress. So I think that has some merit to, reasons as to why that happened for Waddle.\"\nTagovailoa completed just 12 of 23 passes, was sacked twice threw three second-half interceptions. The first one came on the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter when Cleveland's Tyson Campbell returned the ball 34 yards for a touchdown to extend the Browns' lead to 24-6. The second interception came on a 3rd and 12 from the Miami 3-yard line and was nearly returned for another pick six. The Browns scored a touchdown on the next play. His passer rating on the day was a dismal 24.1.The veteran signal caller actually only targeted Waddle three times and Ewers targeted Waddle once before the final whistle sounded. \nDespite Tagovailoa's struggles in recent weeks, coach Mike McDaniel confirmed earlier this week that Tagovailoa would be the team's starter against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 8. Tagovailoa has thrown three interceptions in back-to-back games and became the first NFL quarterback to do so since Philip Rivers did it in 2019.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        An Indianapolis judge has set a trial date for former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez, who faces a felony battery charge, among other offenses, after an Oct. 4 incident. Sanchez is accused of seriously injuring a truck driver outside a hotel. Sanchez's trial date has been set for Dec. 11, with another hearing set for Nov. 20 and a pretrial conference date set for Dec. 2, according to The Associated Press.Sanchez, who works as an analyst for Fox Sports, was not required to be at Wednesday's pretrial conference and did not enter a plea, as he was excused from court as he continues to recover from injuries he sustained in the altercation. Sanchez, 38, was accused of starting a fight with a truck driver over a parking spot while under the influence of alcohol, which led to him being stabbed in the upper right torso. The driver was not charged and claimed self-defense.\"Thank you for allowing our client to be excused from today's hearing. He's still recovering from the injuries he sustained,\" defense attorney Tim DeLaney told the judge, per the AP.\n        \n            \n                Mark Sanchez makes statement upon release from hospital following stabbing, arrest\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFollowing the incident, prosecutors charged Sanchez with a felony count of battery involving serious bodily injury, as well as three misdemeanor charges including public intoxication. Sanchez did not address the charges against him when speaking to reporters after being discharged from a local hospital on Oct. 12. He did say he was focused on his recovery process while thanking the first responders and hospital staff that \"saved [his] life.\"\n\"Right now I am just kind of focused on my recovery and I just want to thank the first responders, Eskenazi hospital, Marion County sheriff and the Indianapolis Police Department, metro PD,\" Sanchez said.  \"But I'm focused on my recovery, and I just want to see my wife, I want to see my son, my two baby girls.\"Sanchez remains free on bond and has been permitted by the court to return home to California. \nSanchez, who played in the NFL for 10 years, had been in Indianapolis to serve as an analyst for Fox's broadcast of a game between the Indianapolis Colts and Las Vegas Raiders. He has not worked on any broadcasts for the network since the incident. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        PHILADELPHIA -- Brandon Graham entered the locker room at the NovaCare Complex ready to congregate with the hordes of media surrounding his locker. Entering his 16th season in the NFL, Graham walked over and smiled before taking his first comments. \"Ya'll ain't gonna let me take my pads off first!,\" Graham said with his infectious smile.Graham waited a long time to have that scrum swarmed around his locker, one day after announcing he was coming back to play for the Eagles for another season. The vibe around the locker room had some extra pep with Graham coming back, as players across the locker room could hear Graham's voice all over the practice field.It didn't take long for Graham to do what he does best.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 8 NFL picks: Cowboys beat Broncos in shootout, Packers spoil Aaron Rodgers' revenge game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I don't feel too far off honestly,\" Graham said of his first practice back with the Eagles. \"I feel good. Now, it's just about being able to talk my trash and work. After like four plays I was like, oh yeah, let me get out and [talk my trash], it's over with.\"\nBack like he never left Even though Graham retired in March, the seeds were planted for him to return at some point. Graham thought he still had some \"juice\" left, knowing he wasn't done with the game he's dedicated his whole life to. Hard to blame Graham, considering the way last season was going before his triceps injury. Graham was having a strong season before tearing his triceps last November, leading him to be out for the rest of the season -- unless the Eagles made Super Bowl LIX. The Eagles did make Super Bowl LIX and Graham was able to play 13 snaps before tearing his triceps again.That was it, right? Graham was going to walk off a Super Bowl champion and never look back. \n\"That storybook can still be there, but reality set in,\" Graham said. \"I still had the urge. I felt like I was still on my game last year. Still felt like I could help the team. If I didn't feel like that, I wouldn't be back. Howie [Eagles general manager Howie Roseman] wouldn't have picked me up if that wasn't the case.\"Graham had the urge to play another season, yet was okay if it wasn't meant to be. He still went to the NovaCare Complex and worked out like he would if he was still playing, just in case if that call came. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio was also in Graham's ear about returning, giving him subtle hints he wanted him back. \"He kept hitting me up, he kept sending me videos and stuff. It was cool,\" Graham laughed. \"He'd be like, you know how you can change this, because my locker room was in the staff locker room, he'd be like are you sure you like this locker? The other locker has more space.\"\nIf there was pressure coming for a return, it wasn't from Graham. He was going to wait until the Eagles called him, biding his time and working out at the NovaCare Complex in case the phone rang. Not long after Za'Darius Smith abruptly retired last week, opportunity arose. \"I wanted to stay on the (workout) schedule while I'm still doing media and all that. I knew after this season if I wasn't coming back, I would have took some time away after that,\" Graham said. \"I was just getting used to not playing and I got that call, and of course I wanted to entertain it. \"I felt like I had some juice left.\"Was Graham really retired?Graham was on the reserve/retirement list by the NFL, yet his former and future teammates couldn't tell the difference. Seen frequently with Jason Kelce working out in the NovaCare Complex, Graham would pop his head in with the players and check in on them.\nThe Eagles never specified a role they had for Graham, and Graham wasn't really sure what he exactly wanted to do either outside of media opportunities. He was hoping the Eagles didn't need him, which is why Graham retired in the first place. Rest assured, Graham did want to come back. \"I walk in, he's watching film just like us,\" said Eagles pass rusher Joshua Uche. \"I just felt like football is one thing that I feel like BG can never get away from. \"Being retired I figured he'd be a coach or something, so when he wasn't coaching I'm, like, all right, something might be up.\"\nGraham even admitted he got advice from Kelce and Fletcher Cox about how the body changes after the football days are done, making sure you keep the routine going in case there was a chance at returning. Kelce was done with football and so was Cox -- but Graham wasn't. Whether it was lifting or working on football-related stuff, Graham made sure he stayed ready in case the Eagles called him. If he wasn't doing that, he was helping out the Eagles' players. Potentially getting ready for a post-playing career. \"He's someone whose always gonna be around the game,\" Uche said. \"But he was doing those podcasts, commentating, so he was around the game, but I feel like he's hands on so to get him back on the field with us, back in the room with us it's just like having a second coach, too, right there helping everybody out.\"\nA new endingGraham had everything he needed to cap off a football career. Already having a Super Bowl ring and making arguably the greatest play in franchise history (strip sack of Tom Brady), Graham walked off the field in Super Bowl LIX a champion. Two Super Bowl rings and having your final game end up in a championship. What could be better? \"When you think about it. When Tom Brady and all them boys came back you still say he got seven rings. He's still gonna tell the story,\" Graham said. \"So it was like man, if I still feel like I can play, why not?\"\nGraham still has that legacy incorporated with the Eagles franchise. That isn't going away because he wanted to play football for a 16th season. A 5-2 start and a chance to repeat certainly helped make the decision to return easier. \"I feel like we got a good team, too,\" Graham said. \"That's another thing. If the team wasn't good I'd be like I'm sorry, I gotta go. But do feel like we have an opportunity of a lifetime right now with these people on the team, how we've done a great job putting this team together. \n\"I still feel like I have a duty to come in here and help. Because I still feel like I have some juice left.\"The way the Eagles keep winning, Graham may be back for year 17, too. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the old saying goes, records are made to be broken.That hasn't been the case through the early portion of the 2025 season, as records aren't falling as consistently as in previous years. Mike Evans was on a quest for his 12th consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season -- which would have broken Jerry Rice's record for the most in NFL history. An early-season hamstring injury jeopardized the streak, then a broken clavicle ended any chance of Evans setting the mark.While Evans won't be setting any records in 2025, several players (and coaches and teams) are still chasing longstanding marks. This season isn't one where offensive numbers are off the charts, but some records are in jeopardy as the league approaches the halfway point.Which records stand a chance of being broken? Who is within striking distance of historic NFL marks? A few are in danger of being snapped.Jaxon Smith-Njigba -- Single-season receiving yards\nSmith-Njigba is on a historic pace heading into Seattle's bye week, as the Seahawks receiver leads the league with 819 receiving yards. His 117.0 yards per game average isn't on track to top Wes Chandler's record of 127.0 (1982), but it puts Smith-Njigba on pace to break Calvin Johnson's single-season record of 1,964 (2012).\nWhile Johnson set the record in a 16-game season, Smith-Njigba isn't going to apologize for playing in a 17-game schedule. He's on pace for 1,989 receiving yards, which would surpass Johnson's mark by 25. Five 100-yard games and an average of 10 targets per game have certainly helped.Brian Burns, Byron Young -- Single-season sacksBurns and Young each lead the league with 9.0 sacks and are entering the conversation for potentially catching Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021), who share the single-season record with 22.5 sacks. Both Burns and Young have played seven games, putting them on pace for 22.0.Each would need to average 1.35 sacks per game to tie Strahan and Watt. Burns has 4.0 sacks over his last two games, while Young has 3.5 in that span. Both are part of stacked defensive lines, so it's very possible their hot streaks will either continue or reignite later this season.\nDrake Maye, Jared Goff -- Highest completion percentage in a seasonThis one will be tough to break, but both Maye and Goff are within range. Maye leads the NFL in completion percentage (75.2%), the third-highest mark through seven games in league history, and is on pace to beat Drew Brees' record of 74.4% (2018).Goff is second in the league (74.9%), also ahead of Brees' pace. It's still early in the season, and one bad game could drop either passer behind Brees' mark, but both have gotten off to historically efficient starts.Jonathan Taylor -- Single-season rushing touchdowns\nThe rushing touchdown record has stood since 2006, when LaDainian Tomlinson scored 28 times. Taylor has 10 rushing touchdowns through seven games and an outside shot at matching Tomlinson.\nTaylor is on pace for 24 touchdowns, which would fall four short of Tomlinson but still mark the most in a season since 2006. That total would also tie John Riggins for the fifth most in NFL history.Taylor has seven touchdowns over his last three games and three outings with three or more scores this season. Tomlinson's record could be in jeopardy if the Colts' offense keeps rolling with Taylor as the centerpiece.\n        \n            \n                Party like it's 2009: How the 2025 Colts have shocked the NFL as legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBaker Mayfield -- Single-season fourth-quarter comebacks \nMayfield has cooled off a bit from his hot start, but the reason the Buccaneers quarterback was in the early MVP discussion is because of Tampa Bay's late-game rallies. The Bucs had last-minute comeback victories in each of their first three games and in four of their first five.\nMayfield has four game-winning drives through seven games and is on pace to break the record of eight shared by Matthew Stafford (2016) and Kirk Cousins (2022). He needs four more to tie them and five more to surpass the mark -- putting him on pace for nine this season.If the Buccaneers keep playing close games, Mayfield will have more chances to add to that total. Of course, Tampa Bay would prefer less-stressful wins -- as would Mayfield.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It was almost crisis mode for Liverpool as Eintracht Frankfurt went ahead in the 26th minute of play on Wednesday in the Champions League, but it was Hugo Ekitike who had a deft finish to bring the Reds level and spark a come-from-behind victory. The Reds went into Frankfurt and ended a four-match losing streak in all competitions with an emphatic 5-1 victory. The match was a return to his former club for Ekitike after leaving Frankfurt for Liverpool during the summer, but with Alexander Isak also joining the Reds, it seemed like Ekitike would be headed to the bench. With Mohamed Salah being rested, the French forward showcased his versatility, starting the match on the right wing and scoring a lovely goal, along with taking three shots.Liverpool went on the counter and Ekitike took a long run before finishing past Frankfurt keeper Michael Zetterer. It was a significant goal as well, with Ekitike finding the back of the net for the fifth time in only his eighth start in all competitions for Liverpool. It's something that has only been done seven times in the last 60 years for Liverpool, and the players who last accomplished the feat make up quite a list, with the late Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah being the last two.\nFrankfurt have now allowed a whopping 10 goals in their last two Champions League fixtures, so this is far from a result that says that all is well for Liverpool, but Ekitike could be in for a run as the point striker. At the half, Slot withdrew Isak, bringing on a winger in Federico Chiesa to move Ekitike to the nine. Isak was withdrawn due to a groin injury, which has been a recurring issue for him over the past year, but it's unknown how long he will be out at this stage. \nIsak still only has one goal and one assist for Liverpool so far since joining, which is far from the expectations after scoring 23 league goals for Newcastle United last season. A chaotic summer that saw Isak train alone due to requesting a transfer away from Newcastle, it has taken longer than expected for him to regain sharpness from and it would make sense for Ekitike to get more starts going forward with Isak coming off the bench.The defensive worries are still there for the Reds, but the best way to combat that is by scoring as many goals as possible like they did defeating Frankfurt. Taking 18 shots and putting 14 on target for 3.18 expected goals, there isn't much more that Slot could want from his attack -- except for consistency. Even Florian Wirtz got two assists after also struggling with his transition to the club. \nLiverpool needed a win to restore confidence, and now they have to chase down Arsenal and Manchester City ahead of them in the Premier League. Next up is an away trip to face Brentford, which is a chance to do more of the same that they did in Frankfurt. If there will be a changing of the tide for Liverpool, Ekitike will have a large part in it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Knicks will host the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday as the Eastern Conference contenders tip off their 2025-26 NBA seasons. Cleveland had the East's best record at 64-18 last year before bowing out in the second round of the playoffs. New York went 51-31 and advanced to the East Finals before losing to Indiana and then replacing Tom Thibodeau with Mike Brown at head coach. The Cavs swept the season series between the squads last year, winning all four games. Cleveland had the third-best spread record in the league last year (52-38-1 ATS), while New York was 50-49-1.Tipoff is at 7 p.m. ET from Madison Square Garden in New York City, where the Knicks went 27-14 last season.

Cleveland's No. 1 offense simply overwhelmed the Knicks in 2024-25, as the team averaged 121 points over the four matchups, which was nearly 10 more points than what New York allowed on average. The Cavs have an MVP candidate in Donovan Mitchell, who averaged 24 points, 5 assists and 4.5 rebounds last year, in addition to the reigning Defensive Player of the Year in Evan Mobley.Both Mitchell and Mobley finished in the top 10 in MVP voting a year ago, and then the Cavs went out and added Lonzo Ball in the offseason. He adds to a stellar group of perimeter players in Cleveland that also includes De'Andre Hunter, who averaged 14.3 points following his trade from Atlanta last season. Cleveland didn't just win on the scoreboard often in 2024-25, as it also won in several sportsbooks as the team's 48-33-1 ATS record was the best in the Eastern Conference. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Knicks can coverThe Cavs team that New York saw last season won't be the same one it sees on Wednesday. Cleveland will be without All-Star, Darius Garland (toe), as well as fellow starter Max Strus (foot). Add in that Sixth Man, Ty Jerome, is now in Memphis, and the Cavs will be without three of their six-leading scorers from last year's playoffs run. Cleveland went just 2-5 straight up in its last seven games without Garland in 2024-25.New York has incredible balance, as it was one of just three teams to rank in the top 10 in both points per game and points allowed per game last year. It particularly shines on the offensive end behind Jalen Brunson (26 ppg) and Karl-Anthony Towns (24.4) as the team ranked in the top eight in field goal percentage, 3-point percentage and free throw percentage. Towns, however, is listed as questionable (quad). The offense only got stronger in the offseason with the signing of super sub Jordan Clarkson, who has more points off the bench (8,045) than any other active NBA player. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Knicks vs. Cavaliers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Cavaliers vs. Knicks and is leaning Under the total, projecting 228 combined points.

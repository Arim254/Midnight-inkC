The 76ers are also playing the second half of a back-to-back, defeating the struggling Pacers, 113-104, on Monday. The 76ers are 23-18 this season, but just 11-11 at home, and the Suns have played well away, going 12-12 on the road. Suns star Devin Booker is averaging 25.3 points per game this season, and has scored at least 24 points in three straight contests, and Dillon Brooks (20.9 ppg) scored 27 points on Monday.

Georgia has struggled to shoot the ball in SEC play and now faces a Missouri defense that ranks No. 1 in two-point field goal percentage. Meanwhile, the Tigers dominate near the rim with Mark Mitchell, one of the best dribble-drive guards in CBB. Foul shooting is always a concern with Missouri, but I like their defense to get enough stops in the second half.\" Back Missouri at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks for Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The Tuesday NBA schedule features seven contests, and most of them have slim spreads so it's highly competitive slate. Six of the seven games have a line of under 5 points, per the latest NBA odds. Amongst the anticipated matchups are 76ers vs. Suns (+1.5), Rockets vs. Spurs (+4.5) and Lakers vs. Nuggets (+2.5). Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers are riding a league-high six-game win streak but are 3.5-point underdogs to utilize in NBA bets as they visit the Chicago Bulls.Kawhi Leonard (knee) not being available plays a big role in that spread, and his absence makes Chicago an intriguing option to back in a Tuesday NBA parlay. The Bulls could get back Josh Giddey (questionable, hamstring) after missing the last three weeks, so NBA player props for the Aussie also deserve consideration with your NBA predictions.

These teams are trending in opposite directions against the spread, with Minnesota going 6-3 ATS over its nine, while Utah has failed to cover in two of its last three and is 2-10 outright over its last dozen contests. The Jazz are just 1-4 versus the line over their last five divisional matchups and have a rest disadvantage, playing the second night of a back-to-back, while the Wolves haven't played since Saturday.\nThe Timberwolves are one of four NBA teams to rank in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive rating, while Utah has the worst defense in the league. The Jazz are last in defensive rating, allow the most points per game, allow the highest FG percentage and give up the most made 3-pointers per game. With those deficiencies, Minnesota is projected to score a dozen more points than what it averages, as the Timberwolves cover in over 60% of simulations. See which other NBA parlay picks to make here, and bet that pick right here:How to make NBA predictions for Tuesday, January 20The model also has locked in two other picks, including backing an underdog to outright win in an A-rated money line prediction.

It's a stacked start on the UFC's new home.Take a look at three can't-miss fights, plus honorable mentions, from UFC's blockbuster debut on Paramount+.Subscribe now to Paramount+ to get access to UFC 324 for just $8.99 per month\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 324 fight card: Paddy Pimblett getting chance to become face of new era among biggest storylines to follow\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSean O'Malley vs. Song YadongThe bantamweight title race is wide open. Newly-crowned champion Petr Yan has three legitimate contenders: Merab Dvalishvili, Umar Nurmagomedov and O'Malley. All three have compelling cases. O'Malley's strongest argument is his 2022 win over Yan, a controversial split decision. UFC sees a star in O'Malley: a highlight-reel striker with a strong online following. A win over Song is exactly what he needs to find his mojo after consecutive losses to Dvalishvili. Song has only struggled against the best, and a win over O'Malley elevates him to new heights.\nUmar Nurmagomedov vs. Deiveson FigueiredoThe other potential bantamweight title eliminator is the feature preliminary fight. Nurmagomedov might be the biggest threat to the new champion. A win over a former two-time flyweight champ does wonders to strengthen his case for a second title shot. Nurmagomedov has performed nearly flawlessly under the tutelage of his cousin, UFC Hall of Famer Khabib Nurmagomedov. Figueiredo enters UFC 324 in the biggest undercard spot of his career. His recent loss to Yan limits his chances for a title shot, but upsetting Nurmagomedov would seriously shake up the division. The best part of UFC 324's matchmaking: none of the four bantamweights competing have fought each other, presenting numerous exciting options for the future.Arnold Allen vs. Jean SilvaThe Oxford English Dictionary would define Jean Silva as \"pure, unfiltered excitement.\" Silva is a dogged athlete who knocks people out and barks at them rabidly. His style is transcendent, appealing to all fans -- longtime, lapsed or new ones. He's also facing an important test. \"Lord\" is coming off his first UFC loss, a nasty KO suffered against Diego Lopes, who challenges featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski next week. Offensive skill and sheer aggression will only take him so far. Allen is a well-rounded and experienced fighter who's never been finished. He's also stubborn enough to bite on his mouthpiece and throw hands if it comes to it. \nHonorable mentions: Natalia Silva vs. Rose Namajunas, Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs. Derrick Lewis, Ateba Gautier vs. Andrey Pulyaev.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Players-only meetings tend to be a last resort. Circumstances have to deteriorate to where you're largely out of options, and even then it tends to be the last lever because you really can't pull it more than once. They just don't usually happen during a game. In the second quarter. At home. Not sure I've seen a bench confab so public and raw as when Jalen Brunson gathered the troops during a timeout in the Knicks embarrassing loss to the Mavericks on Monday.\nThe body language there was not great. Whatever he said to his teammates was obviously urgent enough that he decided it couldn't wait. It didn't work. The Knicks got throttled at Madison Square Garden for their ninth loss in 11 games. It was bad enough that poor Spike Lee looked like he was headed off to therapy at the half.\nIt has been an ugly stretch for the Knicks, but losing at home to a banged-up Mavs team, especially when they got Brunson and Josh Hart back from injuries, is a new low this season. Dallas started Cooper Flagg, Dwight Powell, Caleb Martin, Naji Marshall and Max Christie. Christie alone went for a career-high six 3-pointers -- in the first half. He finished 8-for-10 on 3s. Yikes. That is unacceptable for the Knicks. So is whatever is going on with them right now. The vibes are so bad that Knicks fans booed them on Monday. The team and the head coach noticed -- and couldn't argue with it. Brunson said he'd boo them, too. \"I'm OK with the boos,\" Mike Brown said after the latest loss. \"If we're playing crappy, boo. If I was in the stands, I would boo, too. You pay hard money to come to the games and this is a form of entertainment for the fans. They know good basketball from bad basketball.\"\nThis recent run has unquestionably been the latter. Hart called it \"inexcusable\" and said they all need to do some \"soul searching.\" They're maybe one more loss from burning sage in the locker room. Since winning the NBA Cup, the Knicks -- who are still favored to win the Eastern Conference (+360 at DraftKings) are 7-11. They've fallen seven games behind the East-leading Pistons and, perhaps more disheartening, they're a game-and-a-half back of the Celtics for second. The Knicks just had alumni weekend and welcomed a bunch of their former players back to MSG, only for the team to let the air out of the party balloons with a deflating loss to the Suns. Before that, they had a disastrous four-game road trip where they lost three times, including in Sacramento.The main culprit for the recent collapse starts with the defense. It's been below average for much of the season -- and considerably worse than that lately. The Knicks are 18th in defensive rating, but over the last 15 games they're just 27th. \nThe conundrum here is that their two best offensive players are two of their biggest liabilities on defense. Brunson was just named an All-Star starter and there's a case to be made that Karl-Anthony Towns should join him for the festivities in Los Angeles in mid-February even though he's having a dreadful shooting campaign. (His 52.5 eFG% would be the worst mark of his career.) But for all their offensive output, they tend to get hunted on the defensive end. It's hardly surprising that among the Knicks five most-used two-man combinations, Brunson and Towns have the worst defensive rating. OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges are two of the best and most versatile defenders in the league, and Mitchell Robinson is a top-flight rim protector, but there's only so much those three can do to paper over the deficiencies of the others. Even when the offense was humming early in the season and the Knicks were winning games, the defensive issues loomed in the background. Now they're in full view with a broken team trying to figure out how to piece itself back together on the fly.This is the kind of slide that tends to make people panic. History isn't on the Knicks side here. That has to be worrisome for an organization that last season made its first Eastern Conference Finals in 25 years and came into this season with designs on going further and contending for a championship. Right now, things can't get much worse for the Knicks. But will they get any better?Before the Mavs game, Brown talked about the Knicks being fully healthy and how he was excited to try some different lineup combinations that hadn't been used before. That didn't go the way he hoped, and it's unclear if just shuffling the cards already in their deck is going to result in the winning hand they're looking for. \nMaybe the Knicks shake things up before the trade deadline. Guerschon Yabusele would be the primary candidate to flip for new blood. The Knicks pried him away from the Sixers by giving him the tax-payer midlevel exception over the summer, but he hasn't won over Brown and is averaging fewer than 10 minutes per game. Maybe they dangle him along with some draft capital. They have the Wizards 2026 top-eight protected first-round pick, which obviously won't convey. But it does convert to two second rounders that could be useful. What they could get for that kind of package might not move the needle, but mixing things up has to be a better strategy than simply standing pat given how things are going. The Knicks no longer have the luxury of keeping the faith and sticking with their initial plan. \"We have to play desperate,\" Hart said, \"because that's what we are right now.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Indiana Hoosiers enter the 2026 season as the defending national champions, and in their quest to go back-to-back they will have a new quarterback room. Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza will head off to the NFL as the presumptive No. 1 overall pick in April's draft. His younger brother, Alberto, who served as his backup, will enter the transfer portal, where Georgia Tech is expected to have interest, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. The younger Mendoza appeared in nine games for the Hoosiers, as they regularly found themselves comfortably in front late in games where they could pull the starters. In those appearances, Alberto Mendoza completed 18 of his 24 pass attempts in 2025 for 286 yards, five touchdowns and one interception. If the Yellow Jackets are indeed Mendoza's destination, it could represent an excellent fit. Georgia Tech's starter Haynes King graduated and Aaron Philo transferred to Florida, following offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner, leaving them with a clear need at quarterback. Mendoza would fill that void and join a Yellow Jackets roster that's added a top running back in Michigan's Justice Haynes and a top receiver in Alabama's Jaylen Mbakwe during this portal window. The departure of Alberto Mendoza isn't a surprise considering Indiana already filled it's starting quarterback spot for 2026 in the transfer portal prior to the national title game. The Hoosiers signed former TCU quarterback Josh Hoover, who will be Curt Cignetti's third straight starter acquired via the transfer portal. \nThe first two have worked out incredibly well, with Kurtis Rourke helping them reach their first Playoff appearance in 2024 and then Mendoza leading them to their first-ever national title in 2025. That ramps up the pressure on Hoover to keep Indiana as a national title contender, but they certainly appear set to reload for another run at the Playoff in Cignetti's third season. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL has officially revealed the referees for the AFC and NFC title games this weekend, and the two refs actually have a lot in common.The referee for the AFC Championship is Alex Kemp. The ref in the NFC title game is Clay Martin. Both were promoted to the job of ref in 2018, and both will be serving as the referee in a conference title game for the first time Sunday.With that in mind, let's take a closer look at each the ref for each game. AFC Championship ref: Alex KempKemp has been on the field as a referee for a total of seven playoff games in his career, but this will mark the first time that he's worked a conference title game. Before this year, his last postseason assignment came in a 2024 wild card game where the Ravens beat the Steelers.The 52-year-old Kemp started his NFL officiating career as a field judge in 2014 before being promoted to referee in 2018.\nOne notable thing about Kemp is that his crew had an average of 115.1 penalty yards per game in 2025, which was the fourth-most in the NFL, according to NFLPenalties.com. Of course, Kemp won't be working with his normal crew, so it's possible that number will be cut down.Here's a look at how the Broncos and Patriots have fared over the past five seasons when Kemp has served as the ref in one of their games (stats via Pro Football Reference). Broncos: 3-1 (1-0 in 2025)Patriots: 4-4 (3-0 in 2025)The AFC title game marks the fourth time since Nov. 1 that Kemp has been the ref for a Patriots game. The three previous instances came in Week 10 (Patriots beat Buccaneers), Week 13 (Patriots beat Giants) and Week 17 (Patriots beat Jets). As for the Broncos, they haven't seen Kemp since Week 1 when he served as the ref for their season-opening 20-12 win over the Titans. \nThe AFC title game kicks off at 3 p.m. ET on CBS. NFC Championship ref: Clay MartinThis is the seventh playoff game for the 50-year-old Martin, who has been an NFL official since 2015. Before this year, his most recent postseason assignment came in a 2024 divisional round game that saw the Chiefs beat the Texans.Martin was originally hired by the NFL as an umpire and he held that job for three seasons before being promoted to referee in 2018.Here's a look at how the Rams and Seahawks have fared over the past five seasons when Martin has served as the ref in one of their games (stats via Pro Football Reference).\nRams: 7-0 (1-0 in 2025)Seahawks: 4-3 (1-0 in 2025)The Seahawks only saw Martin once this year and that came back in Week 6 when they beat the Jaguars, 20-12. As for the Rams, they also only had one game with Martin during the regular-season and that came in a 34-7 win over the Buccaneers in Week 12.One other thing to note is that Martin does have some experience with this rivalry. He was the ref for a game between these two teams back in 2024 that the Rams ended up winning, 26-20, in overtime. That was actually a flag-filled game that saw 20 penalties called.The Rams were penalized eight times for 83 yards while the Seahawks were flagged 12 times for 95 yards. The 178 combined penalty yards were the eighth-most in any game during the 2024 season. Most fans would probably prefer not to see such a flag fest Sunday.\nOf the six previous playoff games that Martin has been the referee for, one of them actually involved the Rams. During the Rams' Super Bowl winning season in 2021, he was the ref for their 34-11 win over the Cardinals in the wild card round.The showdown between the Seahawks and Rams kicks off Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox.\n            ",

The injury, which came in the third quarter against the Miami Heat, will end Butler's season.With 7:41 left in the third quarter, Brandin Podziemski tried to float a post entry pass over the top to Butler, who had his man sealed; however, as he went up for the catch, Davion Mitchell collided with Butler, who came down awkwardly on his right leg. The immediate pain felt by Butler and the seriousness of the injury were obvious. \nOne can hear Butler scream in pain immediately, and he was unable to put any weight on the leg as teammates helped him to the locker room.All the Warriors said on Monday night is that Butler suffered a \"knee injury,\" though by early Tuesday morning Shams Charania reported that sources have said that it was an ACL tear in his right knee.\nIf Butler's season is in fact over, Golden State's campaign might be as well. The Warriors (25-19 after Monday's win and currently eighth in the West) were already going to have to go on a big second-half run to crawl above the play-in line. \nWithout Butler, who was in the middle of a terrific season, there is little chance Stephen Curry and Co. can make a serious run in the playoffs with the currently constructed roster. Monday's development figures to impact Golden State's approach to the Feb. 5 trade deadline. Butler has one more season after this on his current contract, and he is owed $56.8 million next season before hitting free agency in the summer of 2027. The Warriors are also looking to move forward Jonathan Kuminga in the next two weeks.\nThe Warriors now are tied for the seventh-longest odds to win the West this season with a +5000 figure at DraftKings.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL coaching carousel of 2026 is moving at full speed. The New York Giants (former Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh) and Atlanta Falcons (former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski) made their respective hires last week. Both the Miami Dolphins (Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley) and the Tennessee Titans (San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh) chose their new coaches on Monday while the Buffalo Bills created a coaching vacancy with the firing of Sean McDermott after nine seasons.After all the action lately, there are now six vacancies left: the Arizona Cardinals, the Ravens, the Bills, the Browns, the Las Vegas Raiders and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Let's take a look at the biggest pro and con for all six jobs ahead of more coaching candidates becoming available after the AFC and NFC conference championship games this coming Sunday. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Cardinals Biggest pro: Young pass-catching trio of WR Marvin Harrison Jr., TE Trey McBride and WR Michael Wilson Biggest con: ManagementThe best thing the Arizona Cardinals have going for them is their young trio of pass catchers in 2024 fourth overall pick wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. (23 years old), 2025 first-team All-Pro tight end Trey McBride (26 years old) and up-and-coming wide receiver Michael Wilson (25 years old). McBride broke the NFL's single-season catches record for a tight end with 126 in 2025, 10 more than Zach Ertz's 116, which held the top spot since 2018. Harrison Jr. is a blue chip prospect who somehow wasn't a featured element of former offensive coordinator Drew Petzing's offense the last two seasons, but there's still plenty of potential there. Wilson broke out in a big way in the second half of the 2025 season. From Weeks 11-18, only Los Angeles Rams All-Pro Puka Nacua (940) had more receiving yards than Wilson's 775.  The biggest con here is management: Cardinals general manager Monti Ossenfort and owner Michael Bidwill. Since Ossenfort became Arizona's general manager in 2023, the Cardinals are 15-36, which is tied for the third-worst record in the NFL. Through three years, the only players Ossenfort has drafted that has really popped is Wilson and cornerback Garrett Williams, both of whom were third-round picks in Ossenfort's first draft back in 2023. Typically, a top-tier coaching candidate desires and needs organizational alignment from top to bottom. That usually requires having a general manager who comes in at the same time as him, something that won't appear to be the case here after three lackluster seasons. That doesn't make sense.\nNow, let's talk about the owner. Bidwill's ownership received a D- grade in the NFL Player's Association 2025 team report cards, which was tied for the second-lowest grade among league owners with the Carolina Panthers' David Tepper. Only New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who received an F, was graded more harshly. As an organization, in all facets, the Cardinals' cumulative team rank by the NFLPA team report cards was dead last for the 2025 season. Players' top concerns from the report included the need for an updated team practice facility, the need for better food/nutrition programs and better treatment for their families. Among players, Bidwill ranked 31st out of 32 owners for willingness to invest in facilities, 28th out of 32 for his contributions to a positive team culture and 27th out of 32 for his commitment toward building a competitive team.What coach wants to walk into a situation with an uneven dynamic with an underachieving general manager and an owner who appears to cut corners instead of investing in his team? There's a reason the Cardinals haven't won a playoff game since the 2015 NFC divisional round. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore RavensBiggest pro:  All-Pro-caliber talent at multiple key positionsBiggest con: Offensive and defensive lines both need makeoversThe allure for the Baltimore Ravens' opening is pretty straightforward: they have All-Pro-caliber talent at multiple key positions. Quarterback Lamar Jackson is a two-time NFL MVP and remains one of the league's best when healthy. \nRunning back Derrick Henry is fresh off being the league's second-leading rusher with 1,595 yards in 2025. He's produced over 1,500 rushing yards, over 5 yards per carry and 15 rushing touchdowns in both seasons with Baltimore since 2024. Safety Kyle Hamilton, a 2025 first-team All-Pro, is the best player at his position in the entire NFL. Cornerback Marlon Humphrey, a two-time first-team All-Pro, was Pro Football Focus' seventh-highest graded corner with a 79.0 defensive grade in 2025, and linebacker Roquan Smith earned first-team All-Pro honors in both 2023 and 2024 before just a Pro Bowl selection in 2025. Punter Jordan Stout was the 2025 first-team All-Pro punter after his 44.9 net yards per punt ranked as the second-most in the NFL. The biggest issue for the Ravens is they need major work to be done on both of their lines in order to return to being one of the AFC's best going forward. Baltimore's offensive line allowed a quarterback pressure rate of 42.3% in 2025, the third-worst in the league ahead of only the Los Angeles Chargers (42.4%) and the Cleveland Browns (45.5%). The Ravens defensive front generated a quarterback pressure rate of just 31.7%, the fifth-lowest in the NFL, which is how they ended up with 30 sacks, tied for the third-fewest in the league in 2025. Even tougher is Baltimore doesn't have a ton of cap room to play with to fix those issues, just $5.1 million in projected effective cap space this offseason, according to OverTheCap.com. That presents the risk that the Ravens' ailing offensive line could lose three-time Pro Bowl center Tyler Linderbaum in free agency this season, which would make an already glaring weakness even worse. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills Biggest pro: Offensive backfield (QB Josh Allen and RB James Cook) Biggest con: Newly promoted president of football operations/GM Brandon BeaneThe biggest pro of the Bills' vacancy isn't surprising: it's their offensive backfield duo of 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen and 2025 NFL rushing champion running back James Cook (1,621 rushing yards). Allen continues to be a dual-threat dynamo with his third consecutive season with 25-plus passing touchdowns and 12-plus rushing touchdowns in 2025. All other NFL quarterbacks in league history have zero such seasons combined.The biggest con is Brandon Beane, the Bills' general manager who was promoted to president of football operations upon former coach Sean McDermott's firing this week. Just look at Beane's failure in providing capable talent at the wide receiver position. Keon Coleman, the first pick of the 2024 second round, was a healthy scratch multiple times in 2025 and was benched for both tardiness and \"disciplinary reasons\" this season. When on the field, Coleman fails to create consistent separation. Joshua Palmer (22 catches, 303 yards, zero touchdowns) didn't move the needle. Neither has Curtis Samuel. Allen's overtime deep ball interception in the playoff loss at the Denver Broncos was thrown to 32-year-old Brandin Cooks because that's the best deep threat he had at his disposal. Whiffs are also present at the cornerback position with Beane trading away 2022 first-round pick Kaiir Elam to the Dallas Cowboys in 2025, and 2025 first-round pick Maxwell Hairston was inactive for both of Buffalo's playoff games. It's unclear if there's a coaching candidate out there with juice like Liam Coen, who was able to convince Jacksonville Jaguars ownership to fire general manager Trent Baalke before taking their coaching job. However, anyone interviewing for this job ought to think about making the same appeal to Bills owner Terry Pegula. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsBiggest pro: New single-season sacks record holder Myles GarrettBiggest con: Cleveland is still struggling to find a franchise QBThe biggest pro of becoming the next coach of the Cleveland Browns is you get to coach five-time first-team All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett. Garrett is fresh off of rewriting the NFL's record books with 23.0 sacks in 2025, the most since sacks became an officially tracked individual statistic in 1982. He is currently on a run of five consecutive seasons with 14-plus sacks, the longest such streak ever. The con is the Browns' constant futility at finding a franchise quarterback. Deshaun Watson continues to lurk on the roster while recovering from a ruptured Achilles. Shedeur Sanders threw an NFL-most 10 interceptions since his league debut in Week 11 while completing the second-fewest rate of passes (57%) in that same span. Rookie third-round pick Dillon Gabriel lost the opportunity to start over Sanders last season. The Browns have cycled through an NFL-most 42 different starting quarterbacks since returning to the NFL in 1999, and it doesn't look like the person who can break this vicious cycle is currently on their roster. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersBiggest pro: The ability mold the roster in their image with the Raiders' plentiful resourcesBiggest con: Lack of job security The Las Vegas Raiders possess the ability to be one of the NFL's teams that could immediately turn things around in 2026 after earning the league's first overall draft pick with a 3-14 record in 2025. With the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, the Raiders have the ability to select Indiana Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner who helped lead his squad to a perfect 16-0 season that culminated with the program's first national championship. That's on top of the Raiders having a projected $67 million in effective cap space, the third-most in the NFL, according to OverTheCap.com. Having building blocks like Mendoza, 2025 sixth overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty, 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers and five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Maxx Crosby in addition to all that cap space could lead to a massive Raiders rebound.\nThe fear here could be a lack of patience from majority owner Mark Davis and minority owner Tom Brady. Las Vegas has cycled through coaches since 2021 going from Jon Gruden (2018-2021) to Josh McDaniels (2022-2023) to Antonio Pierce (2023-2024) to Pete Carroll (2025). Outside of Gruden's firing for non-football reasons, Las Vegas hasn't had an issue moving on quickly from its coaches, pedigree or lack of time on the job be damned. There's plenty of pressure to ace this coming offseason and regular season in 2026 for a Raiders ownership group that demands immediate results. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersBiggest pro: High-floor organization that doesn't have losing seasonsBiggest con: Quarterback uncertainty The Pittsburgh Steelers are the NFL's most stable NFL franchise. They've gone 22 consecutive seasons without a losing record, the longest such streak in league history. Nineteen of those seasons came under the recently departed Mike Tomlin. Pittsburgh is also a loyal organization with just three coaches since 1969: Chuck Noll (1969-1991), Bill Cowher (1992-2006) and Tomlin (2007-2025). That type of stability helps create competent squads year after year. However, the Steelers don't have a starting quarterback or a clear path to go acquire one. Aaron Rodgers is 42 years old and repeatedly said Tomlin was the reason he came to Pittsburgh on a one-year contract. Whether he retires or not in 2026, he likely won't be back. Daniel Jones after tearing his Achilles, Rodgers and Green Bay Packers backup Malik Willis are the top free agents at football's most valuable position. Arizona Cardinals two-time Pro Bowl quarterback Kyler Murray could be available via trade, but he's played 12-plus games just once in the last four seasons. The 2026 NFL Draft has a shallow quarterback class, and the Steelers won't be able to trade up to the first overall pick to go get Fernando Mendoza. That makes doing battle with Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow a combined four times a season in the AFC North a difficult task. \n            ",

That will not be an easy feat to replicate, even though the 16-game schedule is still relatively new in the modern game.While coach Curt Cignetti is deservedly receiving much of the credit for Indiana's almost unbelievable turnaround, the achievement was built on the play of a core group of star players. Standouts such as Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza left an indelible mark on the program, even if their time in Bloomington was brief.Beyond Indiana, this year's College Football Playoff was defined by numerous standout performances, making it fitting to assemble an All-College Football Playoff team -- similar to an All-America team, but limited to the postseason.It should come as no surprise that Indiana ranks near the top with six selections. However, its national championship game opponent, Miami, leads the way with nine players on this year's CFP team. The Hurricanes were undeniably talented, even if their run ended just short of a title.\n Here's a look at the full All-College Football Playoff team. OffenseQB: Fernando Mendoza, Indiana Mendoza had a playoff run befitting a Heisman Trophy winner. He threw for more touchdowns (eight) than he had incompletions (five) in wins against Alabama and Oregon. Then, in the national title game, Mendoza delivered a belated Heisman moment when he ran through Miami tacklers and put his body on the line to score the game's decisive touchdown on fourth-and-5 from Miami's 13-yard line. Perhaps most importantly, he played mistake-free football throughout Indiana's entire run. \nRB: Mark Fletcher Jr., Miami Fletcher was a solid option out of the backfield all season, but he really turned it on when his team needed it the most. He almost singlehandedly delivered the Hurricanes to victory in the first round with a 17-carry, 172-yard performance against Texas A&M. Fletcher torched Ohio State's dominant rush defense for 90 yards while catching a touchdown and managed 133 yards against Ole Miss. He went through those three games without scoring once on the ground, but that changed in the national title game where he had two of Miami's three touchdowns. For those who don't want to do the math, Fletcher had 412 yards and two touchdowns rushing in the CFP alone.  TE: Dae'Quan Wright, Ole Miss Wright was not perfect -- he had several drops in Ole Miss' Sugar Bowl win against Georgia -- but he remained a steady target for quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. He finished with 64 receiving yards apiece against Tulane and Miami and caught a touchdown against the Hurricanes while averaging 21.3 yards per reception. Wright also played a key role as a blocker, using his 255-pound frame to help fuel Ole Miss' potent rushing attack.\nWR: Malachi Toney, Miami It didn't take long for Toney to emerge as one of the most electric playmakers in the sport. The CBS Sports Freshman of the Year, lived up to the billing as Miami marched to the CFP National Championship. Toney was largely kept in check through Miami's first two playoff games, though he did have a touchdown against Texas A&M. He hit his stride with 15 catches for 203 yards and two touchdowns versus Ole Miss and Indiana. WR: Charlie Becker, Indiana This spot also could have been occupied by Indiana's Elijah Sarratt, but Becker cemented his status with a big performance in the national title game. Becker made a couple of crucial -- and tough -- catches to move the chains for Indiana as it triumphed against Miami. He had two snags for 51 yards and a touchdown against Alabama and two catches for 48 yards and a touchdown against Oregon. He's a deep-ball specialist with great hands and a knack for making tough catches all year. His future in Bloomington is extremely bright. WR: De'Zhaun Stribling, Ole Miss Stribling got hot late in the season and carried that momentum into the CFP, where he was the focal point of Ole Miss' explosive passing attack. Stribling finished the Rebels' three-game run with 17 catches for 278 yards and one touchdown, averaging a brisk 16.4 yards per reception in the process. \nOffensive Line Francis Mauigoa, Miami; James Brockermeyer, Miami; Pat Coogan, Indiana; Carter Smith, Indiana; Emmanuel Pregnon, Oregon Miami and Indiana bludgeoned their opponents in the trenches and, as such, earned a lion's share of the offensive line selections. Mauigoa has long been viewed as a likely first-round prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft class and he solidified that status by anchoring Miami's offensive line in the postseason. Coogan, along with the rest of Indiana's offensive line, was named the Offensive MVP of the Rose Bowl. Pregnon, a fellow highly regarded NFL prospect, deserves his flowers for plowing the way for an Oregon offense that averaged around 120 yards rushing per game in the CFP. Defense EDGE: Rueben Bain Jr., Miami There is plenty of Miami flavor along the defensive line. He entered the postseason with 4.5 sacks and now has 9.5. Three of those came in the opening round against Texas A&M, where he was a nightmare for the Aggies. He also delivered a standout performance in the national title game, finishing with eight total tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss and another sack.\nDL: Tyrique Tucker, Indiana The 6-foot, 302-pound Tucker was a bully at the center of Indiana's defensive line. His statistics do not jump off the page, but he was a key piece of an Indiana run defense that largely shut down opponents. He also turned in an impressive six-tackle performance, including half a sack, against Oregon.DL: Ahmad Moten, MiamiMoten is similar to Tucker in that his box score does not tell the full story. He is the type of interior defensive lineman who demands extra attention, freeing teammates -- such as Bain -- to get after the passer. Moten finished with five tackles and a standout tackle for loss against the Hoosiers.EDGE: Akheem Mesidor, Miami Bain was not the only Miami pass rusher to significantly boost his sack total during the playoff. Mesidor was equally difficult to block, recording at least 1.5 sacks in three of the Hurricanes' four postseason games. That run included two sacks against Indiana and two against defending national champion Ohio State -- a clear example of rising to the moment on college football's biggest stage.\nLB: Suntarine Perkins, Ole Miss Ole Miss' do-it-all linebacker lived up to his reputation in the playoff. He forced fumbles against Georgia and Tulane, recorded 2.5 sacks over the final two games and showed his versatility with a rangy pass breakup in the Sugar Bowl. Perkins also averaged two tackles for loss per game during the CFP.LB: Aiden Fisher, Indiana A first-team CBS Sports All-American, Fisher emerged as one of college football's top players this season while captaining a dominant Indiana defense. His playoff run ends with 21 total tackles, 3.5 for a loss, two sacks, one forced fumble and a pass breakup. LB: Ben Roberts, Texas Tech Roberts ultimately appeared in just one playoff game, but his performance in that limited capacity earned him a spot on this team. In fact, he was one of Texas Tech's only bright spots in its disappointing 23-0 Peach Bowl loss to Oregon. He led both teams with 16 total tackles and also snagged an interception off of Oregon quarterback Dante Moore. \nCB: D'Angelo Ponds, Indiana Ponds' game-opening pick-six against Oregon in the Peach Bowl will top highlight reels, and deservedly so. It set the tone for a statement victory. Ponds was the CFP's most lockdown corner, finishing with three pass breakups in the national title game and quieting any concerns about his size by delivering big hits and playing with an edge.\nCB: Brandon Finney Jr., Oregon Finney cemented his status as college football's top freshman cornerback. The 6-foot-2 standout recorded two interceptions and a fumble recovery in Oregon's dominant win over Texas Tech and showed his physicality with 13 tackles, including a half tackle for loss, against James Madison.DB: Keionte Scott, Miami Scott was the glue guy in Miami's secondary. He primarily played slot corner for the 'Canes, but his versatility allowed the defensive staff to move him all over the field. Regardless of role, Scott stood out. His 72-yard interception returned for a touchdown served as the centerpiece of Miami's statement upset of Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. \nDB: Jakobe Thomas, Miami It was Thomas' interception that sealed the deal in the Cotton Bowl, though. He was also crucial in Miami's win against Ole Miss, which sent Miami to the College Football Playoff National Championship. He had five total tackles and two pass breakups in that victory.Special Teams K: Lucas Carneiro, Ole Miss There initially wasn't going to be a special teams section on the All-CFP team, but Carneiro deserves special mention. His 47-yard field goal delivered victory to Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl. That was his third make on three attempts, with two of those coming from at least 50 yards out. He also went 4-of-5 against Miami and finished the CFP 4-of-5 from 50-plus yards. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's no secret that this year's frosh class in college basketball has been special. The build-up to the 2026 NBA Draft will be one of the most anticipated in recent memory, as the influx of pure talent heading to the next level will have a significant impact on the league for years to come.One of the stars of this class has been Duke forward Cameron Boozer, who is one of the favorites to win National Player of the Year honors. If that does happen, Boozer has a chance to join prestigious company as the 10th different Duke player to win the most coveted award in the sport.The last time two different players from the same school won back-to-back National Player of the Year honors, you have to go back to the early 2000s. Former Duke star Shane Battier won NPOTY in 2001. The year after that, Jason Williams won the award.\n        \n            \n                Arizona unanimous No. 1 in AP Top 25, North Carolina falls in college basketball rankings\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFormer Duke star Cooper Flagg won National Player of the Year last season after leading the program to the Final Four. Could Boozer become the latest from Duke to accomplish the feat? Time will tell. But if the season ended today, Boozer would have as good a case as anyone to win it.\nLet's jump into our rankings and get to our CBS Sports/USBWA Freshman of the Week for the 2025-26 college basketball season.  Freshman of the Week: Cameron BoozerWelcome back to the Frosh Watch, our weekly ranking of the ten most impressive freshmen in college basketball. For the 11th season in a row, CBS Sports has once again teamed up with the United States Basketball Writers Association and its Wayman Tisdale Freshman of the Year Award to present this every-Tuesday feature. Each week, we'll start by announcing the national Freshman of the Week honoree. The cycle for FOTW runs Tuesday-Monday.  Boozer, the former No. 3 overall player in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, has been one of the best and most efficient players in the sport this season. The Duke star is averaging 23.2 points per game, which ranks No. 3 among all Division I players. He is also averaging 9.9 rebounds, tied for 17th among all players.\nBoozer is coming off a 30-point outing against Stanford in which he secured his ninth double-double. Boozer also finished with 21 points and 13 rebounds in a 71-56 win over Cal earlier in the week. Duke has won six consecutive games since suffering its first loss against Texas Tech.Previous Freshman of the Week winnersNov. 11: Koa Peat, ArizonaNov. 18: Mikel Brown Jr., LouisvilleNov. 25: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 2: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 9: Hannes Steinbach, WashingtonDec. 16: AJ Dybantsa, BYUDec. 23: Shelton Henderson, MiamiDec. 30: Ebuka Okorie, StanfordJan. 6: Darius Acuff Jr., ArkansasJan. 13: Braylon Mullins, UConn Frosh Watch: Ranking top 10 freshmen \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Cameron Boozer | F | Duke Stats: 23.2 PPG | 9.9 RPG | 4.1 APG Boozer is coming off one of his best games of the season against Stanford.

    "body": "\n        MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- In the moments after No. 1 Indiana pulled off a thrilling win over No. 10 Miami in the College Football Playoff National Championship, Curt Cignetti couldn't help but crack a smile.   As one of the most curmudgeonly coaches in the sport, Cignetti is famous for never showing any joy. But as he picked up the elusive national championship trophy, he looked around at a group of loyal soldiers that had followed him further than anyone thought possible.   Back in 2023, a small FBS upstart called James Madison was irate. The Dukes were in the midst of a transition from FCS to FBS, and believed that they deserved real consideration for the postseason. Teams are traditionally barred from the postseason for two years as they transition levels. Their waiver was denied. Their coach, one Curt Cignetti, was absolutely furious.   In 2024, Cignetti left JMU to take the head coaching job at woebegone Indiana. Two years later, the core of that James Madison team became the nucleus of Indiana's improbable 16-0 national championship team.   \nSeven players remain from the 13 James Madison standouts that followed Cignetti from Harrisonburg, Virginia, to Bloomington, Indiana. And quickly, the group has become a legendary one at Indiana.    \"Having a chip on their shoulder, that's kind of in their DNA,\" special teams coordinator Grant Cain told CBS Sports. \"I don't know if you're ever going to be able to get it out of them.\"   James Madison transfers on Indiana 2025 national championship roster  PlayerPosition\t\t\t\tD'Angelo PondsCB\t\t\t\tSolomon VanhorseRB\t\t\t\tTyrique TuckerOT\t\t\t\tElijah SarrattWR\t\t\t\tKaelon BlackRB\t\t\t\tAiden FisherLB\t\t\t\tMikail KamaraDLMany of the returners are pivotal players on the field. Defensive lineman Mikail Kamara had 22 tackles for loss over the past two seasons. Linebacker Aiden Fisher led the team with 211 tackles over the same period, while cornerback D'Angelo Ponds earned All-America honors.   \nReceiver Elijah Sarratt emerged as one of Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza's favorite targets, while running back Kaelon Black led the team with 79 yards rushing in a 27-21 win in the College Football Playoff National Championship. However, their impact was perhaps even more integral to setting Cignetti's culture.   \"They had that championship attitude,\" Cignetti said. \"They were able to answer questions for the guys to decide to return, and the right guys returned. I think that accelerated our development as a program, there's no question about it.\"   When the seven players were recruited at James Madison, the Dukes were only scratching the surface of being an FBS team. The players were recruited with the knowledge that they wouldn't even be allowed to compete for Sun Belt titles at first.   \nDefensive lineman Mikail Kamara (3) was thought to not have the size and speed to play major college football. He became an All-American in the Big Ten.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Many of them didn't have the measurables for major offers. Ponds, for example, stands only 5-foot-9 and 173 pounds. He got a late offer from Syracuse, but otherwise primarily low-majors recruited him. Kamara was also seen as a tweener, and unrated as a recruit as a result. The staff saw something special in them.   \"They do a great job of watching film and not just looking at rankings or stars,\" Sarratt said. \"I feel like that's what a lot of coaches need to start doing, look at the tape. Your tape speaks for itself. They do a great job of believing in that.\"   When the coaching staff moved from James Madison to Indiana, they were blown away by some of their new resources. The locker rooms were nice, but they also had substantially more access to major training and nutrition resources. At JMU, there was no indoor facility; November practices could be a brutal affair. In the roster they left, Cignetti saw players capable of winning at the highest level.   \nAnd quickly, the players paid him back. When they transferred into the program, they brought stories of Cignetti's consistency and desire to win. It wasn't an act, they said. This is him, and you should buy in.   \"He's the same guy every day, every night, every second,\" running back Solomon Vanhorse said. \"He doesn't change.\"   The transfers were able to advise returning players on Indiana's roster of what they were in for. And with their relentless pursuit of excellence, they proved it was possible.   \n\"His standards are so high for all of us, and you've got to uphold the standard,\" defensive lineman Tyrique Tucker said.  As the fairytale came to life in the national championship game, it was those same seven that remained in the middle of it all. Black, who played second-string for most of the season, exploded for a 20-yard run to set up a touchdown. Fisher had a sack and a key tackle of Miami waterbug Malachi Toney, stopping him just short of a the line to gain on third down in the second half, which meant Miami had to punt near the shadow of its end zone. On that play, Kamara screamed around the edge to block the punt, which Indiana recovered for a touchdown. Ponds was masterful in pass coverage and had three pass breakups.   The Magnificent Seven's fingerprints were all over the performance.   As recently as November, the Hoosiers were the losingest program in the history of the sport. They hadn't won a conference title in 60 years. The program had never even finished higher than No. 4 in the final AP Top 25.   \nCignetti acknowledged after the game that this isn't a group that will produce many first-round NFL Draft picks, with the exception of likely No. 1 overall selection Fernando Mendoza. There are great college players that might not fully translate to the next level. But during their legendary two-year run -- 27-2 in two seasons with back-to-back AP Top 5 finishes -- the team was greater than the sum of its parts.   \"They were all a little underrecruited, they ended up at JMU for a reason,\" offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan said. \"But maybe it was everyone else who got them wrong.\"   Only two years ago, the gritty bunch of misfits wasn't even allowed to compete for national recognition. On Monday, they became national champions.   \n\"I know for me, it changed my life,\" Fisher said. \"I'm here playing at the highest level with some guys that I was playing at a very small level at, and it's just been a crazy journey and one that I'm so glad that we got to do together.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Boston Celtics lost their last two games by a combined eight points, and questionable officiating decisions appeared to play roles in both defeats. The latest instance sat so poorly with coach Joe Mazzulla that he delivered another one of his classic postgame press conference interactions, responding to every question with the same two words: \"Illegal screen.\"Monday night's game against the Indiana Pacers came down to the final possession. Pacers forward Pascal Siakam broke a tie at 96 points with 6.8 seconds remaining. It proved to be a game-winning bucket, as the Celtics did not have an answer on the other end of the floor. But before Siakam put the decisive shot home, he looked to get away with a clear illegal screen.Andrew Nembhard handled the ball in the backcourt when Siakam approached his defender, Derrick White. Siakam stuck his right leg out and shifted his body weight into White, causing the defender to stumble and clearing a lane to the paint for Nembhard. The officials did not call the play dead, and the Pacers proceeded to take a decisive lead.\nMazzulla, the author of numerous memorable postgame answers, responded to each question in his media availability with a brief nod to that play.\"Take us through the last couple possessions,\" one reporter said.\n\"Illegal screen,\" Mazzulla answered.Every further question over the ensuing 43 seconds drew the same response from the fourth-year coach.\nThe whistle has not gone the Celtics' way of late, and star forward Jaylen Brown made that known after the team's previous loss. The NBA fined Brown $35,000 for public criticism of the officiating in Saturday's 100-95 defeat against the San Antonio Spurs after he pointed out the 'bulls----' foul discrepancy between the two teams. The Celtics shot just four free throws while the Spurs took 20 trips to the line.\nConsecutive losses dropped the Celtics from second place in the Eastern Conference to sole possession of the No. 3 spot, one game behind the New York Knicks. Boston's contention for the conference's top seed comes as a surprise given that Jayson Tatum's torn Achilles and a wave of offseason departures from key contributors set modest expectations for the 2025-26 season.\n            ",

    "body": "\nSurvive and advance is the name of the game in the NFL playoffs, and while six teams pulled it off on Super Wild Card Weekend, survive is a relative term for key players on the teams that advanced. Whether it was ACL or Achilles tears, concussions or even just a star QB playing through a finger injury, no team made it out of the wild-card round unscathed.The Rams lost starting corner Ahkello Witherspoon for the rest of the playoffs, but the main focus was around Matthew Stafford's finger injury, which seemed to affect the MVP candidate for a portion of the win over the Panthers. Postgame X-rays on the finger were negative, and considering he finished the game, I'm not expecting him to miss any time.The Bears pulled out the win against the rival Packers but lost left tackle Ozzy Trapilo and linebacker T.J. Edwards to season-ending injuries. The former solidified the blindside protection for Caleb Williams after taking over the role, so Trapilo's injury has a chance to be one of the more impactful from the wild-card round. Edwards is a key component in the middle of the defense as well.The Bills relied on Josh Allen's heroics to gut out a win over the Jaguars but lost Gabe Davis to a torn ACL and Jordan Poyer to a hamstring injury that will likely keep him out against Denver. Dalton Kincaid was also in a boot after the game but the situation was labeled precautionary; we'll see how much that's true as practice reports come out throughout the week.The 49ers cannot catch a break with injuries, losing star tight end George Kittle to a torn Achilles in the win over the Eagles. Kittle is the most complete tight end in the league, and while the team managed to survive his stint on IR earlier in the season, this latest injury plus the absences on defense could be what finally ends their run against a rested Seattle team.The Patriots were up next, shutting down the Chargers offense en route to a low-scoring win, but star corner Christian Gonzalez picked up a head injury during the game. His placement in the concussion protocol means his status for the matchup with the Texans is in question.The Texans closed out the weekend with a dominant win over the Steelers but lost their own star on the offensive side of the ball to a concussion as well. Nico Collins has one less day of recovery to get ready to face New England after playing on Monday, and the calculus of the matchup changes if one or both of Collins and Gonzalez can't go.With all the injuries, the biggest winners of the wild-card round may be the teams that didn't play. The Seahawks and Broncos didn't lose any key players over the weekend, and each could have a player return from IR as Denver linebacker Drew Sanders and Seattle tight end Elijah Arroyo seem to be tracking toward playing this weekend. Other key players who could be back for wild-card winners include Bills defensive tackle Ed Oliver, Rams guard Kevin Dotson and 49ers receiver Ricky Pearsall.I'll have my spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to access all my picks as they're made throughout the week and hopefully take advantage of some good line value. For now, let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for every divisional-round game.Divisional round power ratingsTeam2019181716LAR87.57.57.58SEA7.57776NE65554DEN5.55444.5BUF55454.5HOU333.53.53.5SF22.54.54.53CHI1.51.53.52.51.5The Broncos and Seahawks get a half-point bump for the rest advantage they enjoyed by not playing last week, but I'm also bumping up the Rams with the expectation Stafford is fine and Dotson's potential return matters more than the loss of Witherspoon.I moved the Patriots up a full point due in large part to a defense that got back Milton Williams, Robert Spillane and Harold Landry over the last two weeks. Playcaller Zak Kuhr also had a fantastic game in the win over the Chargers, and that ability to keep the offense guessing could give New England as good a defensive unit as the other teams left on the AFC side of the bracket but with a higher offensive ceiling.I was thoroughly impressed by the Bills' defensive effort as well, and we'll see how much of that is repeatable this week and how much was chalked up to abysmal decision-making by Trevor Lawrence. I'm keeping them where I had them in my ratings, as I felt I was already being pretty aggressive with the best-case scenario for Allen's health.The Texans don't get a bump either, even though they dominated the box score, and that's because of both the Collins injury and how careless C.J. Stroud was with the ball in the win. It ended up not mattering, but you can't outplay a team by that much and only hold a 7-6 halftime lead, counting on your defense to score to win a game.I knocked the 49ers down due to the Kittle injury and to not fully buying into the play of the defense after how easy the Eagles' playcalling made it for them. I probably could've done the same with the Bears but decided as the low man on the table I'd just keep them where I have them.Let's take a quick look at each game's spread projectionBills at Broncos\nI understand why the Bills opened as favorites once again, as so much gets attributed to the quarterback position, but once again I feel like the completeness of the Denver roster plus home-field advantage should make them clear favorites in this game. My spread projection is Broncos -3.5.Last week, we saw late movement push the Jaguars to 2-point favorites by game day, and after seeing where this spread opened I felt like we were in line for the same movement. That may be happening early, as I see the Broncos as slight favorites on the money line at some books as of Tuesday morning. The rest advantage may play a huge factor here as well.49ers at Seahawks\nLike the Bills, the 49ers are playing on six days rest against an opponent who got the week off. However, San Francisco also lost a major part of their team with Kittle's torn Achilles. My projections make this Seahawks -7.5, so I agree with the market move that has pushed it up from an opener of 7 at many books.The Seahawks absolutely dominated the 49ers' offensive line in the game that decided the No. 1 seed in Week 18, but San Francisco didn't have left tackle Trent Williams that day, and he may be the most valuable player in football (even if the award always goes to a quarterback). His presence gives the line a fighting chance, but we'll see what impact the Kittle injury has on the rest of the offense and whether the defense can replicate its effort from last week.Texans at Patriots\nThis line opened at Patriots -2.5 at most books but is likely to quickly settle at 3. My projected spread would be a decent bit higher, as I have the Patriots as 2.5 points better on a neutral field and 5-point favorites in Foxborough.The outdoor environment seemed to affect Stroud in the win over the Steelers, with just one successful offensive drive that resulted in points until the fourth quarter when the Houston defense had let the air out of Pittsburgh. This should be a tougher test for the Texans against a Patriots offense that isn't as likely to be turned into mush by Houston's excellent defensive unit.Rams at Bears\nThis is actually a pretty significant line considering the Bears have had a quality home-field advantage in recent years, but my gap between the teams would actually make it Rams -4 based on ratings.I wanted to love the Bears this week due to their ability to generate turnovers on defense, which we've seen Matthew Stafford struggle with in the Rams' losses down the stretch. But the injuries to Trapilo and Edwards have me less confident the Bears will find a way to win the game.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wild Card Weekend did not let football fans down, as the Los Angeles Rams won a thriller over the Carolina Panthers, the Chicago Bears put together the greatest playoff comeback in franchise history to eliminate the rival Green Bay Packers, Josh Allen scored a game-winning touchdown to move the Buffalo Bills past the Jacksonville Jaguars and the beat-up San Francisco 49ers defeated the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles on their home field.There were 12 fourth-quarter lead changes this weekend, which are the most in a single postseason all time, and four game-winning touchdowns scored in the final three minutes of regulation. We also witnessed some dominant defensive performances, as the New England Patriots held the Los Angeles Chargers out of the end zone completely, as did the Houston Texans against the Pittsburgh Steelers in what may be Aaron Rodgers' final NFL game.How have the Super Bowl odds changed in the last week? Which teams are the favorites to win it all at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8? Here are the latest Super Bowl LX odds, courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Super Bowl LX oddsTeamOddsLast week's oddsSeattle Seahawks+270+350Los Angeles Rams+320+425New England Patriots+600+950Buffalo Bills+650+1000Denver Broncos+700+650Houston Texans+850+1300Chicago Bears+1600+2200San Francisco 49ers+1900+2800Major movement for the PatriotsThe Patriots were indeed favored to beat the Chargers, but not many were expecting Mike Vrabel's defense to make Justin Herbert look like a rookie. He was sacked six times, and completed 19 of 31 passes for 159 yards, zero touchdowns and zero interceptions, while the Chargers scored just three points and recorded 207 yards of total offense.This was a notable performance because the Patriots entered the postseason having played the easiest strength of schedule since the 1999 Rams. The Chargers are objectively one of the better teams the Patriots have faced this season, and they completely dominated. Drake Maye didn't exactly look like an MVP front-runner, as he completed 17 of 29 passes for 268 yards, one touchdown and one interception while also leading New England in rushing with 66 yards, but he did enough to win. Now, Vegas views the Patriots as the front-runners in the AFC. \nBroncos take a back seatWhile the Broncos took the week off and enjoyed their first-round bye, sportsbooks now view them as the third-best team in the conference. Are they a good bet right now? Denver has made the Super Bowl six out of the last eight times they were the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Vance Joseph's defense finished the regular season ranked top three in points per game allowed (18.3), yards per game allowed (278.2), third-down percentage (33.8%), and set a franchise record with 68 sacks. We'll see if Bo Nix and the offense can hit another gear in the postseason, but the Broncos went 14-3 for a reason. Allen and the Bills come to town on Saturday. 49ers surprising long shotsWho currently has the longest odds to win the Super Bowl? It's the team that continues to prove doubters wrong at every turn.The 49ers upset the Eagles on Sunday, 23-19, but sportsbooks are low on San Francisco. That's likely because star tight end George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles injury, while the Niners have to travel to Seattle to take on the No. 1-seed Seahawks.\nIt's natural to doubt the 49ers, but aren't we tired of doing that by now? Their six highest-paid players have missed 60 games this season, yet San Francisco is now 13-5 on the year. This team just defeated the reigning Super Bowl champions on their home field without three first-team All-Pros in Kittle, Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, and didn't have their last two first-round picks active either in wide receiver Ricky Pearsall and pass rusher Mykel Williams. The 49ers have won four straight meetings against the Seahawks in Seattle. They have reached the NFC Championship in each of their last seven trips to the playoffs, so how shocked should we be if San Francisco makes yet another run?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The World Baseball Classic is set for this coming spring and the event has been growing in popularity among fans and players alike. The USA roster this time around is as loaded as it has ever been. To wit, the rotation right now is fronted by both 2025 Cy Young winners with plenty of All-Stars behind them. It's Tarik Skubal, Paul Skenes, Logan Webb, Joe Ryan and, if a fifth starter is even needed, Matthew Boyd and Nolan McLean. Don't worry about the back-end of the bullpen because Mason Miller and David Bednar are on board. The roster isn't yet complete, but there's a loaded lineup in the process of being built. Both Cal Raleigh and Will Smith are lined up as the catching duo. Bryce Harper, Brice Turang, Gunnar Henderson and Bobby Witt Jr. are already rostered, though they're still looking for a worthy third baseman. Kyle Schwarber is on board for the DH spot and Byron Buxton recently joined an outfield that already included Aaron Judge, Corbin Carroll and Pete Crow-Armstrong.Using only the players on board so far, here's what a Team USA lineup might look like: \n1. Bobby Witt Jr., SS2. Aaron Judge, RF3. Cal Raleigh, C4. Kyle Schwarber, DH5. Bryce Harper, 1B6. Gunnar Henderson, 3B7. Corbin Carroll, LF8. Pete Crow-Armstrong, CF9. Brice Turang, 2BNow, there's a lot to sort out here and so many different routes that could be taken. I like stacking the power toward the top of the order and then having the base-stealers all at the bottom, so every time through the order after the first, you're looking at Carroll, PCA and/or Turang as table-setter types for the thunder. It's not like Witt is slow. He's one of the fastest players in baseball and can run plenty in front of the three best non-Ohtani power hitters in baseball from 2025. And there's serious power 1-8 while Turang had 18 homers with a .359 OBP and 121 OPS+ sitting in the nine-hole. Keep in mind, again, that it's possible a big-time third baseman is added here. Plus, Pete Alonso, among others, has expressed interest in playing and could platoon with Harper at first base (it's funny to think about, but with this group it's reasonable, given that Harper hits left-handed and Alonso is a righty). \nWhatever route is taken here and whoever else joins the team, USA manager Mark DeRosa has an embarrassment of riches.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Kentucky point guard Jaland Lowe will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, coach Mark Pope said Monday. It's another brutal blow for one of the nation's most disappointing teams.\"We just finished a long meeting with Jaland Lowe, a really emotional meeting, actually,\" Pope said on The Mark Pope Show. \"... He's dislocated his shoulder three times now. Every time it's been with less and less contact. He's tweaked it in games and tweaked it once in practice to add on top of that. We searched, tried every possible reasonable scenario to have him continue on but just made the wise and right decision today that he'll go have surgery, and so he'll be out for the season. It'll be multiple months -- six months, give or take -- rehab for him to get back to 100 percent health. I don't know if I've seen a guy go through more in such a short span.\"Lowe, a transfer from Pittsburgh, was expected to be a major part of the Wildcats' season, but the shoulder issues have limited him to nine games and two starts. There was a strong three-game stretch in late December and early January in which Lowe averaged 15.7 points and helped lead wins over Indiana and St. John's. But he struggled in last week's loss to Missouri and then played just three minutes in Saturday's win over Mississippi State before re-injuring the shoulder.Overall, Kentucky is and one of the country's most disappointing teams. After being ranked ninth in the preseason AP Poll, the Wildcats sit just 10-6 (1-2 SEC), and they are just 1-5 against ranked opponents. Pope has had to juggle a variety of issues, from inconsistent effort to poor perimeter shooting to injuries. Jayden Quaintance, an Arizona State transfer coming off a torn ACL, has appeared in just four games. Alabama transfer Mouhamed Dioubate missed nearly a month with an ankle injury.\nLowe's injury is a particularly damaging one, though, as he is the only natural point guard on the roster. Pope mentioned Jasper Johnson, a four-star freshman, as one of the players who will need to step up in Lowe's absence. Top scorer Otega Oweh could take on a larger ball-handling role, too.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We are one step closer to Super Bowl LX. The NFL playoffs kicked off with a bang during a frantic Wild Card Weekend that featured several photo finishes. No matter where you looked, playoff games were coming down to the wire across the opening slate. In all, there were four comeback wins in the final three minutes of the fourth quarter -- the most ever in a single postseason.Now, there are just eight teams left standing, hoping to punch their ticket to Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX. As we embark on the divisional round this weekend, the No. 1 seeds in both conferences, the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, emerge from their first-round bye weeks and enter the fray, adding even more firepower to the playoff bracket. As we gear up for more action, let's take our first look at the divisional round matchups, along with the odds and a quick preview of each contest. AFC Buffalo Bills at Denver BroncosSaturday, 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nWe don't have to look far back to find the last time these teams met in the postseason, squaring off just last year in the wild card round. Buffalo throttled the Broncos at Highmark Stadium, 31-7. Denver scored on the opening drive, then was shut out the rest of the way.\nThis matchup, however, should be different. For starters, it will be played at Mile High after Denver secured the No. 1 seed. The Broncos also boast one of the NFL's top defenses, allowing just 18.3 points per game during the regular season. They'll need that elite level of play again to keep Josh Allen -- who scored three touchdowns last week -- in check.The Bills quarterback is coming off his first career road playoff win after beating the Jaguars in Jacksonville and is looking to add to his postseason résumé, entering this matchup as a road favorite.\n        \n            \n                NFL wild card overreactions: Josh Allen is the biggest X factor of playoffs; A.J. Brown done in Philly?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHouston Texans at New England PatriotsSunday, 3 p.m. ET on ESPN (Stream: Fubo -- try for free) \nThis will be the first meeting between these two teams since the 2016 divisional round, which New England won on its way to a Super Bowl title. They last met in Week 6 of last season, when Houston rolled to a 41-21 victory, but both teams look very different now.\nBoth quarterbacks are also looking to bounce back from uneven wild-card performances. Drake Maye threw two interceptions in a win over the Chargers, while C.J. Stroud is coming off a three-turnover outing against Pittsburgh. Houston still boasts one of the NFL's top defenses and showed it again Monday night against the Steelers. New England isn't usually grouped among the league's elite units, but it looked the part after sacking Justin Herbert six times on Sunday night, setting the stage for what could be a defensive showdown.NFCSan Francisco 49ers at Seattle SeahawksSaturday, 8 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nWe have ourselves a rubber match between two NFC West rivals. The Seahawks and 49ers split the regular-season series, with San Francisco winning in Week 1 before Seattle returned the favor with a 13–3 victory in Week 18 to clinch the No. 1 seed and the division title. Oddly enough, both games were won by the road team, but the 49ers will have to overcome some significant injury issues to keep that trend alive here.\nSan Francisco has been hit hard by injuries all season and is coming off a playoff win over Philadelphia in which star tight end George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles tear. That leaves Brock Purdy without one of his primary weapons as he faces an elite Seattle defense. The Seahawks ranked No. 1 in scoring defense this season, allowing just 17.2 points per game, and also led the league on third down and in yards per rush allowed.That defensive dominance, along with Sam Darnold's strong play at quarterback, helped Seattle win 11 of its final 12 games to close the regular season. This is the fourth time the Seahawks have earned the No. 1 seed, and each of the previous three resulted in a trip to the Super Bowl.Los Angeles Rams (-3.5) at Chicago BearsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC\nBoth teams pulled off late wins on Wild Card Weekend. Los Angeles avoided a road upset against the Carolina Panthers after Matthew Stafford led a seven-play, 71-yard, game-winning touchdown drive in the final two minutes of regulation.\nChicago, meanwhile, staged a miraculous second-half comeback against the Green Bay Packers, erasing an 18-point deficit. Caleb Williams and the offense erupted late, outscoring Green Bay 25–6 in the fourth quarter.The last time these teams met came during the 2024 regular season, when Chicago earned a 24–18 win. In that game, D'Andre Swift piled up 165 yards from scrimmage, while Stafford threw no touchdowns and committed two turnovers.\n            ",

There was no drama in the final game of the wild-card round, however, with the Texans routing the Steelers, 30–6, on Monday night to earn the first road playoff win in franchise history. Houston became the eighth and final team to punch its ticket to the divisional round.In the AFC, the Texans will be joined by New England, Buffalo and Denver. The top-seeded Broncos, coming off a bye, will be in action for the first time this postseason when they host the Bills on Saturday. Houston, meanwhile, will head to New England on Sunday with a spot in the AFC Championship Game on the line.In the NFC, Seattle and San Francisco will meet for the third time this season after splitting their first two matchups. The Seahawks are well-rested after a wild-card bye, while the 49ers will be playing on just five days' rest. In the other divisional matchup, the Bears will host the Rams, marking Chicago's first home divisional-round game in 15 years.With that in mind, here's the full playoff schedule, including the dates and kickoff times for the divisional round.Wild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) Jaguars\nBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) SteelersTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick-six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history. Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17(6) Bills at (1) Broncos, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS)(6) 49ers at (1) Seahawks, 8 p.m. ET (Fox)Sunday, Jan. 18(5) Texans at (2) Patriots, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC)(5) Rams at (2) Bears, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC Championship, 3 p.m. ET (CBS)NFC Championship, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

That said, the committees usually put players on those ballots who lasted a long time on the BBWAA ballot and/or got close to the 75% needed for induction. Bobby Grich is a player from several years before Lofton who has gotten similar treatment. On the flip side, Lou Whitaker only got 2.9% of the vote in his one chance with the BBWAA and he was on a Committee ballot in 2020, so maybe there's hope. Snee also asked: Should baseball go to automatic five get in every year like NFL?Snyder response: Plenty of baseball fans who already, incorrectly, love to say the Hall is getting watered down and this could kick things into overdrive. While there are a decent number more players I'd love to see in the Hall -- such as Lofton, Grich and Whitaker, to name three -- I still think five every single year from the BBWAA ballot would be too many and we'd get to the point of the Hall truly being watered down.\nAdam R. asks: Many HOF writers mention how they have to really dive into a player's numbers and career to make final decisions. How thorough is that research? What does that process entail and how much time does it take for borderline candidates? Are you provided any research assistance?  Snyder response: To answer the last question first, the Hall of Fame includes a packet with statistics for every player on the ballot with the ballot we receive in the mail, but it isn't overly extensive. Nor should it be. We have so many tools these days. Going to the JAWS pages on Baseball Reference is an easy way to get a decent idea of the players on the ballot (here's second base, just so curious readers can see what it looks like). I do not, however, think any single stat like this is the so-called be-all and end-all. Any player who is even close gets extensive research from me and that includes reading the opinions of others. I will seek out as much information as possible and sometimes I change my mind. I've already noted in this voting cycle that I added Félix Hernández. I didn't vote for him last year and did so this year. It wasn't because I put extra weight on first-year votes (he was a first-year guy last year) and it wasn't because I \"caved\" or something. I just think I made a mistake and rectified it. On players close like this, I spend hours, sometimes multiple days, on research. Dan wonders: We know that position matters a high degree in HOF voting (i.e. the second baseman with the most HRs) but what influence should batting order play, especially as the game evolves? I.e. should leadoff men be judged v. cleanup? Is this different in '90s v. 2010s?  \nAdditional context. Leadoff men until the '00s were nearly *always* slap-hitting middle infielders. Managers fell into a stereotype. Shouldn't they be judged exclusively compared to their peers, as is the case with position-by-position voting?Snyder response: First things first, thank you to Dan for throwing a pitch right in my wheelhouse. I have a book out, Leadoff Man, that was published just over a month ago. I do think some leadoff men over the years have been overlooked a bit in Hall of Fame voting. Tim Raines took far too long to make the Hall when his biggest on-field crime was not being Rickey Henderson, the G.O.A.T. leadoff man. Lofton getting less than 5% in his first year was a total farce. He should be in. Overall, for me, I think we can make concessions based on batting order at times in judging players for the Hall of Fame. For example, for a few years with Andre Dawson on the ballot, I heard people pointing out his sub-par (.323) on-base percentage. As a middle-of-the-order hitter, though, through the '80s and into the early '90s, he wasn't supposed to walk. He was tasked with driving in runs.\nLeadoff men for a long time, as you said, were supposed to be light-hitting guys who got on base and drove the pitcher crazy. In my book, I call it the \"pest factor.\" Over the years, plenty of the greatest leadoff hitters like Henderson, Raines, Paul Molitor, Lou Brock and on down to the likes of Richie Ashburn and Earle Combs have made the Hall, but I do think if we're having this discussion that perhaps Brett Butler could've gotten more run for the Hall of Fame. How about Bobby Bonds in being a trendsetter as one of the first power-speed combos at the top (only his son went 30-30 as many times)? This year, I've been stumping for Jimmy Rollins, both as an all-time great leadoff man but also a \"heart and soul of his team\" guy. Jon H. wonders: What is the most important metric when weighing someone's Hall of Fame potential? Hitter and pitcher  Snyder response: I don't think there's ever one stat that defines a player and I want to see the most complete picture possible. I do start with WAR and JAWS (as noted above), as it is one number that is very easily sortable by position. I can't reiterate enough that I would never take just one stat as the be-all end-all. This is only a starting point before diving into more metrics. I'd say next for hitters I'd look at the triple-slash line (AVG/OBP/SLG) with OPS+ so there's context behind the number that accounts for the era in which the player played. From there I'm always going to look at the major counting stats like hits, doubles, triples, home runs, RBI, runs and stolen bases. It's all important. For pitchers, similarly, I'd go to ERA and ERA+ next before diving into innings and strikeouts. I'll still glance at wins and losses -- and saves for relievers -- but those are becoming less important in the current era. \nEveryone is different, but for me, \"less is more\" doesn't really apply. I want to study as much as possible about a player.James H. asks: Given that we've likely seen the last pitcher to reach 300 wins in their career, has a new criterion taken its place ala quality starts or career ERA? Are there any other criterion that have evolved since you began covering baseball?  Snyder response: This piggybacks nicely with the previous answer. For me, I want to look most at what an individual player can control and how good he is at controlling it. The old mantra \"a pitcher's job is to win\" is archaic given that the pitcher needs run support in addition to help from the bullpen these days. That means the W-L record loses its luster. A pitcher's job is to put his team in the best position to win by limiting the runs by the opposition. He can do that by not allowing baserunners (WHIP), by striking out opposing hitters and by working as deep into the game as his team allows (IP). Things like ERA, ERA+ and FIP and xFIP measure the run prevention and the innings, strikeouts and WHIP are very important as well. Newfangled numbers like WAR and JAWS attempt to take everything into account. As noted some in the previous answer, I like the biggest picture possible. \nFurther, with workloads being much more limited in these most recent generations of starting pitchers, I think lowering the standard a bit for starting pitchers and the Hall of Fame needs to happen.Rich B. wonders: Can playoff stats get someone into the Hall of Fame? Let's say regular-season starts are a little better than average but postseason stats are incredible. Obviously games played in the postseason affects it, but is that something writers consider when it's a borderline candidate?  Snyder response: I don't think a player who wasn't even close to a Hall of Famer in the regular season should get enough credit for stellar postseason numbers to push him into the Hall of Fame. As an example, let's say George Springer retired right now. He's one of the most prolific playoff performers of all time at this juncture, but his regular-season numbers show him as a very good player who isn't a Hall of Famer. He'd still fall short to me. \nI don't think there's anything wrong with giving bonus points if a player is close, though. From this ballot, let's look at Carlos Beltrán. I think he should've been a Hall of Famer in his first try anyway -- though the sign stealing scandal damaged him more than anything else, so let's ignore that for a second -- but let's suppose that you aren't fully sold on him as a Hall of Famer based on the regular-season numbers. In 65 career playoff games, Beltrán hit .307/.412/.609 with 15 doubles, 16 homers, 42 RBI, 45 runs and was 11 for 11 in steals. You've gotta award him bonus points for that, right? To answer your question specifically, if I had a borderline candidate and his numbers looked like Beltrán's in the playoffs, I'd let that clinch my decision and throw that player a vote. On the flip side, it's such a small sample and there are always so many factors involved that if a player was a lower-tier Hall-worthy candidate and had awful postseason numbers, I wouldn't penalize him. I'm sure that might not sound fair to some people, but I'd never hold bad playoff stats against a player while I'm open to giving bonus points to excellent playoff numbers. This is a good illustration of my mindset. I'm a positive guy. I'm a Big Hall voter. I'd err on the side of more votes rather than fewer. \n            ",

The Steelers finished the season 10-7 after winning four of their final five games, and they enter the postseason playing some of their best football of the year.Houston finished second in the AFC South at 12-5, but ended the year as the hottest team in the NFL. The Texans dropped to 3-5 after a Week 9 loss to the Broncos, then ripped off nine consecutive wins to end the season. Led by one of the most ferocious defenses in the league, they are certainly playing their best ball of the year as well.Will the Texans go on the road and knock off Pittsburgh, or will the Steelers pull off the upset? We'll find out soon enough. Before we dig into some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Texans in a playoff edition of \"Monday Night Football.\"Where to watch Steelers vs. Texans liveDate: Monday, Jan. 12 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh)TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Texans -3, O/U 38.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey StorylinesHot at the right time. Both of these teams enter this game playing quite well. As mentioned above, the Steelers have won four out of their last five games and the Texans have won nine in a row. The Steelers have turned the ball over just once during that five-game span and have scored 26-plus points in each of the four wins after doing so just five times in their first 12 games. The Texans have forced multiple turnovers in five of their nine consecutive wins and allowed 20 points or less in six of them. Aaron Rodgers in the playoffs. Rodgers won a Super Bowl in his second postseason appearance, going 4-0 in the playoffs along the way. Since then, though, he is just 7-9 in postseason action. He's played fairly well (63.8% completion rate, 7.3 yards per attempt, 32 touchdowns against 10 interceptions) but his teams have lost several games they probably should have won, including a pair of overtime losses. Rodgers also hasn't actually played in the playoffs since the 2021 season, when he went 20 of 29 for 225 scoreless yards in a 13-10 loss to the 49ers. He'll now face one of the best defenses in the NFL this time around.Houston's defense. The Texans finished the season first in yards allowed, second in points allowed and tied for first in TruMedia's version of EPA per play. You can't really throw the ball on them -- teams completed only 59.3% of their passes at an average of just 5.8 yards per attempt, with 20 touchdowns against 19 interceptions. Opponents averaged -0.13 EPA per dropback, which means the Texans basically turned every quarterback into J.J. McCarthy. But you also can't really run on the Texans. Opponents averaged just 4.0 yards per carry, and only 1.08 per carry before contact, via TruMedia. The Texans are one of the best tackling teams in the NFL, and they don't allow teams to get going downhill against them.Playoff picture. After the Patriots and Bills won on Sunday, the winner of this game will head to New England to take on the Pats in the divisional round. New England is coming off a 16-3 victory over the Chargers. The Steelers beat the Patriots earlier this season in a game where the Pats turned the ball over five times. The Texans and Patriots didn't play, as the Pats' only regular-season games against playoff teams were that game against the Steelers and a pair of matchups against the Bills. That win over the Pats was Pittsburgh's only victory against a fellow playoff team during the regular season, as the Steelers went 1-5 in those games. The Texans, meanwhile, went 4-4 in games against playoff teams after starting the season 0-3 in those contests.Steelers vs. Texans predictionLook, I've been picking against the Steelers all season and they keep making me look stupid by pulling games out of their collective butts. But I'm still picking against them here. I just can't see them consistently moving the ball against this ferocious Houston defense -- especially if Rodgers is unwilling to hold on to the ball for long enough to even try pushing it down the field. All the checkdowns he likes to throw to the running backs don't work as well against the Texans as they do against other teams because of how they rally to the ball. I'm not sure Houston can move the ball with any degree of consistency on the other side, but I'm going to back the team with the best single unit in the game here.\nPick: Texans 16, Steelers 10 | (Texans -3, Under 38.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Of course, some of us already watched our quarterback don his Superman cape and carry their team to victory. (Love you, Josh Allen.)It's the most exciting time of the year for football, with the playoffs trucking along and college about to crown a national champion. But what to do about our sports needs mid-week? Well, lucky for you, there's plenty to catch up on, and still quite a bit of sports action to watch on this mid-January Tuesday, so let's dive into it.  🏈 Five things to know Tuesday Texans defense leads rout of Steelers. The final game of the wild card round went from a nail-biter to a laugher as the dominant Texans defense finally broke down Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers offense. The Texans held a narrow 7-6 lead at the half, but a strip sack touchdown and pick six by the Houston defense was enough to cement what became a 30-6 victory. The Steelers converted just two of 14 third downs in what could prove to be the final game of Rodgers' career. Houston will travel to New England for a divisional round matchup. Here's the complete bracket with recaps and schedules.Dylan Raiola commits to Oregon. The Ducks have landed their quarterback of the future, with former Nebraska QB Dylan Raiola committing to play in Eugene. This could present an interesting situation, with Dante Moore not guaranteed to declare for the 2026 NFL Draft despite being a near-lock as a first-round pick. Can Raiola and Moore co-exist as two talented players on a national championship contender? Meanwhile, Sam Leavitt has committed to LSU, as the Tigers landed the No. 1 player in the transfer portal.College basketball rankings undergo a shake-up. Vanderbilt is No. 3 in the Top 25 And 1 rankings, and it could be a while before the Commodores suffer their first loss. Arizona has taken over the top spot in the Coaches Poll after Michigan suffered an upset loss to Wisconsin. Michigan also fell from No. 2 to No. 4 in the AP Top 25. In the women's AP Top 25, UConn is the unanimous No. 1.Fun with college football bowl rankings. Brad Crawford ranked all 41 college bowl games this season; unsurprisingly, Miami's epic Fiesta Bowl win over Ole Miss took the top spot. Ahead of the CFP championship between Indiana and Miami, Chip Patterson ranked every champion of the CFP era.Xabi Alonso fired by Real Madrid. Real Madrid pulled off a shock managerial change, letting Xabi Alonso go and installing Alvaro Arbeloa as the new manager. Chuck Booth went into detail on what went wrong for Alonso at Real Madrid. 🏈 Do not miss this: Storylines abound heading into NFL divisional playoff round \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The matchups are set for the divisional round of the NFL playoffs following the Texans being the fourth road team to advance this weekend. The wild card round was, well, wild, with incredibly close games and drama throughout -- at least until the fourth quarter of last night's game in Pittsburgh. But the drama should only pick up from here, and there are plenty of storylines that have emerged as we head toward the second weekend of the playoffs. \nIn Saturday's 34-31 wild card win over the Panthers, Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford sprained the index finger on his throwing hand. Stafford is expected to play Sunday against the Bears, but it's still to be seen what impact the injury will have on the MVP favorite's performance. Other injuries are also going to shake up how divisional rounds may play out. With George Kittle out with a torn Achilles, Christian McCaffery says the 49ers will be playing for the sidelined tight end the rest of the way. Patriots Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzalez is in concussion protocol after hitting his head on the turf in Sunday night's game with the Chargers. The already thin Buffalo wide receiver room took another hit with Gabe Davis out for the remainder of the year with a torn ACL. Also read: Patriots' suddenly dominant defense becomes the biggest wild card of the NFL playoffsAfter a surprisingly quick exit from the playoffs, the Eagles find themselves with more questions than answers 🏀 How has Anthony Davis' injury affected his trade value? \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            It was mind-blowing when the Mavericks traded Luka Dončić to the Lakers, with Anthony Davis as the centerpiece coming to Dallas in return. The trade, among other issues, led to the firing of Dallas general manager Nico Harrison, and has not paid off well, with Davis continuing his career trend of battling injury after injury. Most recently, Davis suffered ligament damage to his left hand that could end his season if surgery is required. \nThat's a big issue for Dallas, with the team shopping Davis on the trade market in an attempt to continue to build around Cooper Flagg. Sam Quinn took a look at what Davis' latest injury means for his trade value and what the Mavericks can expect moving forward. Quinn: \"There may still be teams that view him as a worthy investment for the 2026-27 season and beyond, but at his age, his value is likely to decline with each passing year. The best postseason run he has left in him was probably going to be 2026, and now it might be over before it begins. Take those win-now teams off of the table and the price goes down by sheer volume. The more teams want a player, the more his team can get for him. A lot of suitors are probably walking away right now. \"And those who remain are reckoning with those 296 injuries to 51 unique body parts. It seems as though every time Davis starts to build some momentum, an injury takes it. Will anyone trust Davis to remain healthy after a trade? And even if he does, what sort of player will Davis be for them?\" 🏈 Playing NFL head coach matchmaker \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            While there are eight teams that have not seen their seasons end, plenty of others are just trying to find the right man to steer the ship moving forward. There are several head coaching gigs available (eight, to be exact) and intriguing names such as John Harbaugh, Mike McDaniel and Kevin Stefanski available to fill those spots. Tyler Sullivan played matchmaker to determine the best men to fill those eight openings. Sullivan has Harbaugh ending up as coach of the Giants. Sullivan also looked at the three best fits for Harbaugh, placing the Falcons and Titans at No. 2 and 3, respectively. \nSullivan: \"New York is a destination that has a young quarterback in place, and Jaxson Dart flashed a tremendously high ceiling during his rookie campaign. That said, he'll need to be reined in with some of his scrambling, which Harbaugh should view as an easy fix. Once Dart gets that honed in, he'll be quite the dual-threat quarterback, which Harbaugh knows something about after coaching Lamar Jackson to two NFL MVP awards.  \"But the Giants are not just a good fit because of Dart.

    "body": "\n        PITTSBURGH -- Monday night was a stark contrast to what had transpired in Pittsburgh eight days earlier, when Aaron Rodgers rallied the Steelers to a thrilling win over the Ravens that clinched the AFC North division title and the playoff spot that came with it. While that win was the culmination of a largely successful regular season for Pittsburgh, the 30-6 blowout loss to the Texans in the AFC wild card exposed what the Steelers have been the better part of a decade: a team that is good enough to post winning records but not good enough to win games when it matters most.Monday night sealed the Steelers' ninth consecutive season without a playoff win. If that wasn't bad enough, Pittsburgh has the dubious distinction of being just the fourth team in NFL history to lose seven straight playoff games. Obviously, these are not records that the Steelers want to be associated with.As the Steelers enter the offseason, let's evaluate what could and should happen next if Pittsburgh wants to finally take the next step in 2026.\nMike Tomlin's future There's no denying that Tomlin is a very good coach and has been for a long time. Even Tomlin's biggest critics must ackowldge his peerless ability to consistently churn out competitive teams.Every single team that Tomlin has trotted out has gone at least .500. He has won eight division titles and guided the Steelers to the playoffs in 13 of his 19 seasons. He's won a Super Bowl, coached in another and ended the 2025 season tied with Chuck Noll for ninth on the all-time regular season wins list.While you must acknowledge Tomlin's success, you also can't ignore his and the Steelers' shortcomings under his watch. The Steelers are 8-12 under Tomlin in the playoffs which includes a 3-11 record in their past 14 playoff games. During their current seven-game losing streak in the playoffs, Tomlin's teams have been defeated in double-digit fashion six times. The Steelers don't just lose in the playoffs -- they have often failed to show up.\nGiven Tomlin's body of work, it's hard to fathom Steelers president Art Rooney II firing him with two years left of on his contract. If Tomlin isn't back in 2026, it would likely be because he wants to do something else. Tomlin, however, has given no indication that he wants to do anything else anytime soon.Two years ago, Rooney extended Tomlin's contract with the expectation that Tomlin would get the Steelers back to winning playoff games. So far, that hasn't happened, and if that continues to be the case, don't expect Tomlin to continue to be the Steelers' coach when his current contract expires. In the meantime, expect Tomlin to make changes to his coaching staff this offseason. That will likely include defensive coordinator Teryl Austin, whose contract is set to expire.\nUpgrade the receiving corps It's hard to give a true evaluation of Aaron Rodgers' performance this season given the lack of weaponry he had at receiver. The Steelers traded for DK Metcalf, but they never found anyone to replace George Pickens, who was an All-Pro during his first season with the Cowboys. Pittsburgh's inability to find Pickens' replacement this season is nothing short of mind-boggling. The Steelers had the entire offseason and up until the trade deadline to do something, and they never did. That, more than anything, contributed to another season that ended without a playoff win.Reports surfaced that Steelers general manager Omar Khan wasn't willing to relinquish the assets required to get a receiver to complement Metcalf. That decision proved to be costly, as Khan and 67,297 paid customers watched on Monday as Rodgers continued to pay the price for Pittsburgh's lack of receivers.\nMuch was said about the Texans' pass rush, led by Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. And while both players were disruptive on Monday night, a lot of their success was the byproduct of Pittsburgh's lack of open receivers.To be fair to Khan, he's tasked with not only fielding competitive teams this season, but in the years ahead. He clearly didn't want to give way too many assets for a potential rental, especially when Rodgers was largely making due with what he had. Khan will have up to 12 draft picks at his disposal this offseason, and it would be a safe bet that he plans to allocate some of those picks into upgrading his receiving corps.\nFind an offensive identity One of the Steelers' issues this season was their over-reliance on Rodgers to carry the offense. Rodgers said late in the year that he relishes that responsibility, but a 42-year-old player shouldn't be asked to shoulder such a burden.Pittsburgh wanted to give Rodgers a powerful running game to lean on, but that didn't happen despite productive seasons from Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell, who was voted team MVP by his teammates. The Steelers finished just 26th in rushing during the season and were out-rushed by more than 100 yards by the Texans on Monday night.The Steelers gambled when they allowed Najee Harris to test the market and replacing him with rookie Kaleb Johnson, who was a healthy scratch against Houston. While Johnson may end being a good player, the Steeles need to make upgrades at running back this offseason. It isn't their most pressing need, but it is a need nonetheless.\nIt's worth asking if the Steelers' running game could have been better this year if offensive coordinator Arthur Smith put more emphasis on it. The Steelers rarely ran between the tackles and failed to take advantage of Warren's physicality.Speaking of underutilized players, don't be surprised if Pat Freiermuth's's face ends up on a milk carton this offseason. He caught just 42 passes this season despite being one of the NFL's most reliable tight ends since being drafted in 2021.Make a plan at QB Instability would be the best way to describe the Steelers' quarterback situation since Ben Roethlisberger's's retirement at the end of the 2021 season. That needs to change if Pittsburgh is going to be a legitimate Super Bowl contender anytime soon.\nRodgers was noncommittal about his plans following Monday night's loss, but my guess is that he has played his last down for the Steelers. Either way, the Steelers need to commit themselves to finding a longtime answer at the most important position in sports.As stated earlier, the Steelers could have up to a dozen picks in the upcoming draft. They could use some of those picks to trade up to try to acquire one of this year's top-ranked quarterback prospects, a group that includes three potential first-round picks in Indiana's Fernando Mendoza, Oregon's Dante Moore and Alabama's Ty Simpson.If the Steelers chose to wait another year to spend a high pick on a quarterback, it wouldn't be a bad idea to see what they have in Will Howard, a 2025 sixth-round pick who led Ohio State to a national title a year ago. The Steelers could hold an open competition this offseason with Howard, veteran Mason Rudolph and another veteran.\nBest case, Howard blossoms into a quality player who can help the Steelers continue to climb up the AFC's pecking order. If he doesn't, the Steelers would likely be in a better position to draft their potential longterm answer at quarterback in the 2027 NFL Draft.One thing the Steelers shouldn't do is sign another aging quarterback. That will only serve as a temporary band-aid. Invest in your youth While most Steelers fans will quickly try to erase Monday night's game out of their memory bank, they shouldn't forget the big plays made by some of their young players, albeit in a losing effort.\nRookie Jack Sawyer, for example, forced a fumble of C.J. Stroud that was recovered by fellow rookie Yahya Black. It was the second forced turnover in three games for Sawyer, a third-round pick who made the most of his limited snaps while playing behind T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig.\"I think it speaks volumes to our coaching staff and our veteran players who have been so great to us this first year,\" Sawyer said following Monday's game when asked about his development this season. \"I've learned so much from T.J. and Alex and [Herbig], and I know [Derrick Harmon] and Yahya can same the same thing about the guys in their room.\"Obviously, this sucks. Feel like this group was special. We've got a lot of growth left to do, and it's time to attack it this offseason.\"Harmon, the Steelers' first-round pick this past year, also had a sack of Stroud while helping a Pittsburgh defense that jarred the ball out of Stroud's hands five times. Harmon made a significant impact this season when he was healthy, especially against the run. The Steelers also appear to have something good going in terms of the offensive line. While it clearly has room to grow, Pittsburgh received solid play this season from second-year starters Zach Frazier, Mason McCormick, and 2024 first-round pick Troy Fautanu, who was basically a rookie this year after an injury sidelined him for virtually all of his first season. \"I don't think there's a better center in the league,\" Rodgers said of Frazier on Monday night. \"I watched it every single week. ... The right side [of the offensive line], that's got to excite Steelers fans when you've got three young guys at center, right guard, right tackle who have played so well all season. That's pretty exciting.\"While they are often labeled as an old team, the Steelers do have some young potential cornerstones in place. The Steelers can aid in their collective growth by putting better players around them this offseason.Trade a big-name player? It's been floated in the past that the Steelers should trade the 31-year-old Watt, who signed a massive extension last offseason. Given what just transpired, the Steelers should consider any option this offseason if it can lead to better results. That should include the possible trade of several high-priced veterans.In a salary-cap sport, you can't keep everyone, which means that the Steelers will at some point be faced with difficult decisions when it comes to some of other big-name players that also includes Metcalf, Cam Heyward, Patrick Queen and Jalen Ramsey. The Steelers showed their willingness to trade a \"legacy\" player when they dealt Minkah Fitzpatrick to Miami. Don't be surprised if they make a similar move this offseason if they think it can help deliver a playoff win for the first time in a decade.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For several college football programs facing elite expectations and graced with talented rosters, the 2025 season failed to go as planned. There was no better representation of that during bowl season than Penn State matching up with Clemson in the frigid Pinstripe Bowl, a far cry from playoff laurels.Parity rose to the highest degree this fall and most preseason projections were left in smoldering ruin by midseason when it became clear that many of college football's perceived titans failed to do what was necessary to win big.One of the wildest coaching carousels in recent memory ensued and a few of these underachievers will start fresh in 2026. Here's a look at the 2025 season's biggest whiffs ahead of next week's national championship game.\n1. Preseason hype too much for Penn StateImagine telling yourself in August that James Franklin would be Virginia Tech's head coach by season's end? You wouldn't have believed it. After retaining a number of key players who led the Nittany Lions one win shy of a national championship game appearance last season, Franklin and Penn State fell quickly as a preseason top-3 team. The double-overtime loss to Oregon was tough to stomach, but nothing compared to what the next several weeks would involve, including the colossal setback at UCLA the next time out.Franklin was fired after an unfathomable three-game slide in Big Ten play took Penn State out of the national rankings altogether, a shocking faceplant for a program that appeared to have turned the corner under his regime. Franklin leaves the program with the second-most coaching wins all time in Happy Valley with 104 victories, tied with Rip Engle and behind the legendary Joe Paterno. However, his tenure will primarily be remembered for how it ended. Not the good times.Nittany Lions by the numbers under Franklin15 straight losses to opponents ranked inside the AP poll's top 62-21 mark against the top 6; second-worst by any FBS head coach all time2025 team became first FBS squad since 1978 to lose consecutive games as 20-point favoritesCombined 4-17 against Ohio State and Michigan\n        \n            \n                Ranking all 41 college football bowl games for 2025-26: CFP drama in Fiesta, Sugar provide thrills\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. Clemson's stunning collapse This was supposed to be the year for Dabo Swinney, who was equipped with a roster that rivaled some of the best he's had at Clemson over his decade-plus tenure. Instead, the Cade Klubnik-led rocket ship never lifted off the ground with a payload that failed to ignite, resulting in the Tigers' worst season since 2010. From preseason top-5 to six total losses following its no-show against Penn State in the Pinstripe Bowl, Clemson's stock tanked extremely fast earlier and never regained traction after home losses to SMU and Duke pushed the Tigers to rock bottom.\nSwinney's hire of former assistant Chad Morris as his new offensive coordinator isn't all that encouraging after moving on from Garrett Riley, but the Tigers were able to retain a few of their most talented playmakers including wideout T.J. Moore. From the outside looking in, it feels like the Morris hire and Clemson's newfound willingness to go after transfer portal talent will determine what's left of Swinney's tenure in Death Valley.Morris brought a tempo-drive scheme to Clemson for the first time in 2011 after the Tigers finished 6-7 during Swinney's second full season as coach. Over the next four years, Clemson went 42-11 overall with record-setting production offensively, led by quarterback Tajh Boyd, who developed as an All-ACC passer under Morris. Will the same happen with projected 2026 starter Christopher Vizzina? Swinney's counting on it.3. LSU tanks under Brian KellyWhen you guarantee a College Football Playoff appearance and it doesn't happen, well, that's all you get at LSU. Pressure was mounting on Kelly before the Tigers signed a top-flight transfer haul last cycle, so needless to say LSU needed to maximize its talent this season to convince decision-makers they had the right guy in charge. The season deteriorated after a loss at Ole Miss, the final nail coming with Texas A&M's beatdown in Baton Rouge. The Tigers were in win-now mode searching for their first playoff berth since 2019 and Kelly blamed just about everybody but himself for the program faltering under his watch. After moving to No. 4 following early wins against Clemson and Florida -- who each turned sour -- LSU dropped to 5-3 with an anemic offense before the plug was pulled.\nIn the aftermath of his firing, Kelly filed a lawsuit over the buyout situation to get the full $54 million he is owed, per his contract, but LSU claimed then-athletic director Scott Woodward didn't have the authority to fire him and had yet to send him a formal letter of his firing at the time of his filing. Kelly's attorneys later sent LSU a letter claiming the school was dragging out the firing process and doing their client harm in terms of finding a new job. Now that the dust has settled on the 2025-26 coaching cycle, Kelly remains unemployed while handsomely rich.Brian Kelly walks off the field for the final time as LSU coach's after the Tigers' loss to Texas A&M in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Oct. 25. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            4. South Carolina regresses to pretender statusFor a program emanating promise after nearly reaching the CFP for the first time in 2024, the nationally-ranked Gamecocks were humbled early by Vanderbilt and Missouri before finishing 1-7 in SEC play under fifth-year coach Shane Beamer. South Carolina blew a 27-point halftime lead at Texas A&M and squandered a late advantage against Alabama at home before hitting its season-low in the finale against Clemson. Quarterback LaNorris Sellers underperformed, the offensive line was atrocious and Gamecocks play-caller Mike Shula was canned after only one season.Gamecocks' paltry offensive production under Mike ShulaScoring offense: 19.7 PPG (16th in SEC, 119th nationally)Total offense: 294.1 YPG (16th in SEC, 131st nationally)Rushing offense: 100.8 YPG (16th in SEC, 128th nationally)Passing offense: 193.3 YPG (15th in SEC, 104th nationally)Third down conversions: 32.5% (15th in SEC, 127th nationally)Sacks allowed: 34 (15th in SEC, 134th nationally)Turnovers: 13 (13th in SEC, 97th nationally)5. Colorado hits downward spiralFrom taking accountability following the worst loss of his coaching career to banning players from postgame interviews, this was a tough year for Deion Sanders and the Buffaloes. Now 16-21 at Colorado over three seasons, the first year post-Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter was supposed to bottom out with bowl eligibility -- not an embarrassing 3-9 finish that featured three Big 12 losses by 24-plus points. Liberty transfer Kaidon Salter was serviceable at quarterback, but not exactly the difference-making splash Colorado expected while heralded freshman Julian Lewis preserved his redshirt with only four appearances.\nThere's considerable pressure on Sanders in Boulder after several personnel department and coaching staff changes followed the program's second tumultuous season in three years. Colorado only signed a dozen players in its 2026 recruiting class from the prep ranks, a group slotted outside the top-50 nationally per 247Sports' rankings, and has lost 36 players to the portal since its season-ending loss to Kansas State.Sanders said last summer the Buffaloes \"wanted to win at all costs\" and sidestepped questions about his future amid health concerns. However, after his second losing season since arriving at Colorado ahead of the 2023 campaign, Sanders must generate positive momentum in 2026 or he could be headed toward an ill-fated ending as coach.\n            ",

Mullins, the former No. 12 overall player in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, has been a key part of UConn's rotation since making his debut against Illinois back on Nov. 28. He logged under 25 minutes during his first four college games but has played over that threshold in each of the last seven games.\nMullins logged a career-high 41 minutes during an overtime win over Providence. He finished with 24 points on 8 of 14 shooting (including six made 3-pointers) and added three assists, two steals and two rebounds. The Huskies haven't lost a game this season in which Mullins played.Previous Freshman of the Week winnersNov. 11: Koa Peat, ArizonaNov. 18: Mikel Brown Jr., LouisvilleNov. 25: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 2: Cameron Boozer, DukeDec. 9: Hannes Steinbach, WashingtonDec. 16: AJ Dybantsa, BYUDec. 23: Shelton Henderson, MiamiDec. 30: Ebuka Okorie, StanfordJan. 6: Darius Acuff Jr., Arkansas Frosh Watch: Ranking top 10 freshmen \n    \n                                        \n    1. Cameron Boozer | F | Duke Stats: 22.9 PPG | 9.5 RPG | 4.2 APG Boozer had a strong showing against Louisville last week.

    "body": "\n        I don't want to say that the NFL should cancel the rest of the postseason, but the league might want to give it some serious thought because there's no way anything is going to top what happened on Wild Card Weekend. The Panthers almost pulled off a total shocker, the Bears pulled off a miracle comeback, the Jaguars got Josh Allen'd, the 49ers pulled off the biggest upset of the round and the Chargers tried. At least I think they tried. Once the Chargers get into the playoffs, it's hard to tell what they're doing. Same with the Steelers. Now, we're moving on to the divisional round where things tend to be much more predictable, but since there's been nothing predictable about this entire season, I'm going to go ahead and assume that all four games are going to be totally unpredictable.  Normally, the key to picking games in the divisional round is to not overthink it, which could be a problem for me because I overthink everything. I mean, I just told you that the divisional round is usually predictable, but then also said that nothing predictable has happened this season, so the divisional round will probably be unpredictable and the most unpredictable possibility in an unpredictable season would be for something predictable to happen. No one would predict that. I told you, I overthink everything. \nThe reason you don't want to overthink things in the divisional round is because the home team usually dominates. Over the past 11 years, home teams have gone 32-12, which basically means we're getting an average of roughly one upset per year, so I'm going to go ahead and plan to pick one upset. Maybe two. Who knows. Also, teams favored by a touchdown or more in the divisional round have gone 20-4 straight up since the 2014 season, which would seem to favor the Seahawks, who are favored by seven points. So am I going to automatically pick every road team to lose? Am I actually going to pick one upset? Are the Seahawks a lock to win? Does any of this mean anything? Let's get to the picks and find out. \nOdds courtesy of DraftKings SportsbookNFL divisional round picks(6) San Francisco (13-5) at (1) Seattle (14-3)Saturday, 8 p.m. ET (Fox, Fubo, try for free)\nWell, here we go again. For the third time this season, the Seahawks and 49ers are facing each other. They opened the year with a game in Week 1, they closed the year against each other in Week 18, and now, they'll play one more time with a trip to the NFC title game on the line. Let's check out the scores from the previous two games: Week 1: 49ers 17-13 over SeahawksWeek 18: Seahawks 13-3 over 49ersThere were only two games all year where the 49ers defense held a team with a winning record to 13 points or less and both of those came against Seattle. The 49ers defense tends to struggle, unless they're facing the Seahawks.  If the Seahawks have one advantage going into the game, it's the fact that the 49ers are already complaining about the schedule. If you're complaining, you've already lost, even if you have a legitimate gripe. The Niners had to play on Sunday in Philadelphia, and now, they have to turn around and play on a short week in Seattle. This will mark the third time in four games that the 49ers have had to play on a short week. Kyle Shanahan pleaded with the NFL to give his team a Sunday game this week, but the NFL ignored him, and let me just say Kyle, I know that feeling. My 5-year-old ignores me whenever I tell her to clean up her room. \nNow, in Shanahan's defense, if there's one team that could have used an extra day of rest, it's definitely the 49ers. The team has been banged up all year: Their players have combined to miss a total of 263 games due to injury this year, which is the fifth-most in the NFL. Oh, and the injuries continued to pile up during the wild card round with George Kittle tearing his Achilles against the Eagles. After the injury happened, Kittle did what anyone in his situation would do: He pounded a bottle of tequila. \nAnyway, the point here is that the 49ers won't have Kittle this week. The 49ers put up just 173 yards against the Seahawks in Week 18 WITH KITTLE and I can't imagine things are going to get much better without him. \nI have a hard time seeing the 49ers light up the scoreboard, so it's going to be on the San Francisco's defense to keep this close. The good news is that they might actually be up to the task. Not only do they get to face a Seahawks' offense that they've held to 13 points per game this year, but they get to face Sam Darnold. During the regular season, Darnold struggled against the 49ers: He was held under 200 yards passing in both games and he threw exactly zero touchdown passes. Darnold tends to struggle in big games and I don't expect that to change here. As a matter of fact, I won't be surprised if the Seahawks take the game out of his hands by running the ball 40 times. The Seahawks are not going to let Sam Darnold lose this game for them. Seattle ran the ball 39 times against the 49ers back in Week 18 and I fully expect to see a similar game plan on Saturday. \nThe Seahawks are healthy, they're going to be rested and they're playing at home. On the other hand, the 49ers are not healthy, they're not going to be rested and they're not playing at home. So I should obviously take Seattle here, right? I've mentioned this 17 times this year, so I don't think it will hurt if I mention it again, but the 49ers were my preseason pick to win the Super Bowl, which makes it very easy for me to talk myself into a 49ers win here. The offense struggled in Week 18, but they didn't have three-time All-Pro Trent Williams, who should be on the field this week. They also could have Ricky Pearsall, who would help Brock Purdy stretch the field. And let's not forget about that fact that Kyle Shanahan has NEVER lost in the divisional round (5-0) and Purdy has never lost in Seattle (4-0).I almost talked myself into going bang bang Niner gang for the win, but I think the 49ers are too bang banged up to pull it off. \nPICK: Seahawks 19-16 over 49ersRecord picking 49ers games this season: 12-6Record picking Seahawks games this season: 13-4Record picking Seahawks-49ers games this season: 1-1(6) Buffalo (13-5) at (1) Denver (14-3)Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on Paramount+)\nThis could definitely go down as the best day ever for people named Sean with Sean McDermott facing Sean Payton for the right to go to the AFC title game. The only way this could get any better is if they played the game on Sean Connery's birthday. And let's not forget, we could still get a Sean vs. Sean Super Bowl if one of these two teams ends up facing Rams' coach Sean McVay. Anyway, the last time we saw these two teams on the field together came last January when the Bills destroyed the Broncos, 31-7, in the wild card round. \nHave the Broncos gotten better since then? Yes. Have the Bills gotten worse? Yes. Have the Broncos closed a 24-point gap? I'm not so sure about that. I'm guessing that Broncos fans were rooting hard for the Chargers on Sunday night, because if L.A. had won, then Denver would be hosting the Chargers in this game. Instead, the Broncos are getting their worst nightmare, a matchup with a Bills team that is built to beat them. If you want to beat the Bills, you have to be able to run the ball, but the Broncos haven't really been able to do that this season. They averaged 118.7 yards per game on the ground, which ranked 16th overall in the NFL. That number has been even worse over the past four weeks with the Broncos average just 108.5 yards per game. If you can run on the Bills, you can control the clock and that keeps Josh Allen off the field. If the Broncos can't get their run game going, it could be a long day. All three of Denver's losses this season came in game where they were held under 120 rushing yards. If the Broncos can't the run the ball, that will put the game in Bo Nix's hands, and that could be trouble, especially against a Sean McDermott defense. McDermott came up with a game plan last year that Nix struggled against. The Broncos QB went 3 of 3 for 64 yards in the first quarter of last year's playoff game, but then went just 10 of 19 for 80 yards over the final three quarters. That doesn't mean we'll see the same thing this year, but Nix is a streaky quarterback and it's impossible to predict which version of him will show up on Saturday. We could see the Nix who threw for 302 yards and four touchdowns in a huge December win over the Packers or we could see the Nix who threw for just 182 yards in a nail-biting Christmas Day win over a Chiefs team that didn't have Patrick Mahomes. \nNix thrives when he's forced out of the pocket -- he completed a league-high 80 passes from out of the pocket in 2025 -- but he'll be facing a Bills defense that allowed the fewest completions outside the pocket in the NFL this year. If the Broncos have one advantage this week, it's the fact that they're coming off a bye while the Bills will be coming off a short week after playing on Sunday in the wild card round. Not only are the Bills on a short week, but they have to deal with the mile high air. It's not an easy adjustment and it's a big reason why the Broncos have won four straight home playoff games. Also, Sean Payton has NEVER lost a playoff game coming off a bye (4-0). He's the new Andy Reid.The only thing standing between the Broncos and their first AFC title berth in 10 years is Josh Allen, but unfortunately for Denver, that's a big obstacle. In the wild card round, Allen led his first career game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game, and now, I'll say he takes one step closer to getting to his first career Super Bowl. \nPICK: Bills 23-20 over BroncosRecord picking Bills games this season: 11-7Record picking Broncos games this season: 13-4(5) Texans (13-5) at (2) New England (15-3)Sunday, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC; Fubo, try for free)\nHouston, we have a problem, and that problem is that the Texans got stuck playing in the dreaded Monday night game during the wild-card round, which has been a nightmare for almost everyone who has ever played in it. Over the past three years, four teams have won on Monday in the wild-card round and they've combined to go 0-4 in the divisional round, which makes it sound like I should stop thinking about this pick right now and just take the Patriots.The Texans are also the only team in NFL history that has never won a divisional round game. As a matter of fact, if you're a fan of the Texans, you might not even be aware that there are more playoff rounds AFTER the divisional round because Houston has never made it that far.The Texans have existed since 2002 and since then, they've played in the divisional round a total of six times and they've gone 0-6. Two of those six losses have come against the Patriots, and now, everyone in Houston will be hoping that the third time is the charm. This game is going to feature two of the best defenses in the NFL and the more I think about it, the more I think that the final score could end up being 11-8. Mike Vrabel is a defensive genius who came up with such a good game plan against the Chargers that he confused a former NFL quarterback. \n\"I have absolutely no idea what coverage they're in\" is probably what Justin Herbert was thinking for half the game against the Patriots. The other half of the time, he was probably thinking, \"Oh crap, I'm about to get sacked again.\"If Vrabel was able to confuse Herbert, there's a good chance he'll be able to confuse C.J. Stroud, who might be the QB I trust the least out of all the quarterbacks still in the playoffs. Stroud fumbled the ball FIVE TIMES against the Steelers on Monday night, which was the most by any player in 31 years. The Texans offense still has yet to top 20 points in any road game this season and I have a hard time seeing that changing against a Patriots defense that gave up just 18.8 points per game during the regular season, which was the fourth-fewest in the NFL. Not only is Stroud facing a tough defense, but he might not have Nico Collins on the field. The Texans star receiver might not play after suffering a concussion on Monday night. The biggest question in this game is how will Drake Maye react to playing a good defense for the first time this season? Maye has not had to face a top-five defense all season, but that will change in this game. The Texans gave up the fewest yards in the NFL (277.2 yards per game), they gave up the second-fewest points (17.4 per game), they gave up less than 100 yards rushing per game and they're good at stopping the pass. I don't know how it's possible, but they're good at EVERYTHING. I give the Texans the edge on defense and I give the Patriots the edge on offense, and well, the old adage doesn't say anything about offenses winning championships, it definitely says that defenses win championships, so I'm going with the better defense. PICK: Texans 19-16 over PatriotsRecord picking Texans games this season: 12-6Record picking Patriots games this season: 13-5L.A. Rams (13-5) at Chicago (12-6)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)\nWhen I see that a team from California is playing a team from the Midwest on the road in January, the first thing I usually do is Google the weather for the game, so I decided to Google Chicago's weather for Sunday, and I have some bad news for the Rams: It's going to be cold.   \nThe forecast for this week's game is calling for a high of 15 degrees -- with a wind chill possibly below zero -- and you know who's not going to be fazed by that? The Bears. On other hand, I'm starting to have a feeling that the weather might end up being a problem for the Rams. If you've ever been to Los Angeles, you may have noticed that people start wearing jackets there when the temperature falls below 65 degrees. And as someone who lived in Southern California for two years, I can tell you from first-hand experience that people in Southern California don't go outside if the temperature drops below 60 degrees. No Californian has ever experienced sub-60 degree weather unless it was by accident. As for the game, Sean McVay is arguably the best coach in the NFL right now, but there's one thing he still hasn't done in his career and that's win a game in Chicago. McVay is 0-2 in the Windy City and if he wants to end that streak, he's probably going to need to have his team practice in Antartica this week, because that's the only way he's going to be able to simulate the weather that's expected in Chicago. The big question in this game is whether Matthew Stafford is going to be able to throw the ball in arctic conditions. If he can, the Rams could roll to a win, but if he can't, then the Bears might be able to pull off the upset. Not only will Stafford be dealing with the cold weather, but he also sprained a finger on his throwing hand in the wild card round, which could impact his ability to throw the football. After the injury happened, Stafford went 4 of 19 on his next 23 passes, before rebounding to throw for 143 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against Carolina. McVay said Stafford's finger is OK, but I feel like he has to say that.One thing about Stafford is that he almost never has to play in weather like this. In his 17-year career, he's played in just FOUR games where the temperature was under 30 degrees. In those four games, he went 2-2 and he's averaged 186 passing yards per game with six touchdowns and just one interception. His numbers aren't great, but he could have some success this weekend. The Bears defense led the NFL in interceptions this year, but if they weren't picking off a pass, then they were getting picked apart. The Bears gave up the 11th most passing yards in the NFL and the fifth-most touchdown passes, and now, they have to stop the QB who led the NFL in both of those categories. Chicago's defense could certainly get some help from the cold weather, but I could also see Stafford having a big game. When you're playing in the cold weather, it helps if you can run the ball well and if the Bears can get their rushing attack going, that could open door for an upset. The Rams are just 1-3 this season when they surrender 140 yards or more on the ground, and as I mention every week, the Bears are undefeated (8-0) when they top 140 rushing yards. I hate picking against the Bears, because they seem to find a crazy new way to win every week, but I can't pick against Stafford. PICK: Rams 27-20 over BearsRecord picking Rams games this season: 13-5Record picking Bears games this season: 10-8Last Week Best pick: Last week, I predicted that the 49ers would go into Philadelphia and pull off the biggest upset of the wild card round and guess what happened? The 49ers went into Philadelphia and pulled off the biggest upset of the wild card round. Now, did I know that the Eagles were going to forget how to run their offense? Of course, I did. If you watched the Eagles play a single game this year, then you already knew what was going to happen, because every game is the same: The Eagles will run one or two big plays and then Kevin Patullo calls 10 straight plays that make no sense. The Eagles offense is essentially a Ferrari with my grandma driving, but also, it has one flat tire. If they get the tire fixed and get a new driver in there, they should be OK, but who knows if that will actually happen. The 49ers ended up winning 23-19, which I'm only pointing out, because we came ONE POINT AWAY from a Breechigami. That is where I predict the exact score of a game and if Jake Elliott didn't miss an extra point on Sunday, we would have had our first Breechigami of the year and I would have celebrated by taking down a George Kittle-sized bottle of tequila. Worst pick: Last week, I decided that this would finally be the year that the Chargers would stop Chargering in the playoffs, but the joke's on me, because that definitely didn't happen. Anyone who has ever watched the Chargers play a single game in the postseason knew there was a 500% chance they were going to lose, but I picked them to win anyway. Justin Herbert is now 0-3 in the playoffs in his career, which means he is now officially entering Andy Dalton territory. Herbert is one of just four quarterbacks since 2000 to lose each of his first three playoff starts, a list that he is on with Dalton.

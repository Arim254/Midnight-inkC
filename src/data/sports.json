    "body": "\n        Scottie Scheffler makes his season debut as the odds-on favorite to win the 2026 PGA American Express Tournament. The world's top-ranked golfer is looking to win his 20th PGA tournament since turning pro in 2018. Scheffler, 29, last won at the Procore Championship last September in Scottsdale,  Ariz. He won by one stroke over fellow American Ben Griffin. This year's event gets underway on Thursday at 11:30 a.m. ET from La Quinta Country Club in La Quinta, Calif. The tournament will begin on a par-72 course measuring 7,210 yards. Scheffler is the +280 favorite (risk $100 to win $280) at DraftKings Sportsbook. Other favorites include Ben Griffin at +2000; Sam Burns, Russell Henley, Robert McIntyre and Ludvig Aberg at +2500; and Patrick Cantlay at +3000. Before making any 2026 American Express picks, you need to see the 2026 American Express predictions and best bets from golf expert Brady Kannon. Kannon is an elite golfing handicapper with more than 30 years of experience in the industry. He's hit eight major outright winners since 2013. In the fall of 2022, he hit outright winners in three consecutive weeks: Russell Henley (40-1), Tony Finau (18-1) and Adam Svensson (150-1). Last season, he hit Hideki Matsuyama (22-1), Harris English (110-1), Ludvig Aberg (25-1) and Ben Griffin/Andrew Novak (25-1) in New Orleans. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nNow, Kannon has focused his attention on the 2026 American Express field and locked in his best bets and top sleepers. You can only see them here. Top 2026 American Express expert picks One of Kannon's 2026 American Express predictions: He's completely fading Wyndham Clark, who is going off to 80-1. He's avoiding him in outright bets and advises to go against him in head-to-head bets as well.\"Clark did not play in Hawaii and missed the cut in his last regular Tour start back in early November,\" Kannon said. \"He finished 13th here at the Amex in 2022 but otherwise hasn't been better than 39th and missed the cut here last season. He is losing strokes both off the tee and on approach in each of his last five starts. Last season, Clark ranked 154th on Tour in Strokes Gained: Approach and 160th in Driving Accuracy. I also wonder if Clark's feelings of frustration regarding Brooks Koepka's return to the PGA Tour could still be a lingering distraction as he makes his season debut. I did find one head-to-head matchup with Clark as an underdog to J.T. Poston and yes, I would play the favorite against our fade player of the week.\" See who Kannon is backing at SportsLine.\nNew users can also check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $200 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make 2026 American Express picksKannon has revealed his best bet, and it's a surprising golfer going off at nearly 100-1.

    "body": "\n        After an abbreviated stop in Hawaii, the 2026 PGA Tour schedule begins the West Coast Swing with The American Express 2026 beginning on Thursday at the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif. After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his debut as part of The American Express 2026 field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. Still, the 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the clear-cut +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +2000, with Robert MacIntyre and Russell Henley at +2200 and Ludvig Aberg at +2500. Patrick Cantlay and Sam Burns are both +2700. Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, one of the favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week despite being a +3500 longshot.

L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play.

On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass.

    "body": "\nWe've known a lot of playoff chokers over the years, guys who curled up in the fetal position in the big moments.Consider me curled up.I am choking when it comes to my NFL picks.The past two weeks have been a bloodbath for me, the worst playoffs of my career. And it's not close.How bad? How does 1-9 against the spread hit you? Even straight up, I am 5-5 the past two weeks. I went 1-3 against the spread last week -- New England was the only winner -- and 3-1 straight up.My playoffs have been so bad that there is a chance I might not finish above .500 for the year ATS. That would be awful considering the run I was on at one point.What a collapse.My season ATS record is now 141-138-3, so barring an \"oh-fer\" in the title games and the Super Bowl, I will make it. My straight-up record is now 181-100-1. Anybody out there good at the Heimlich Maneuver? I seem to be choking in a big way.Championship Sunday NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (+5.5)Sunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nWith Bo Nix out with a broken ankle, the Broncos will turn to Jarrett Stidham at quarterback in this one. He hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since 2023, but Broncos coach Sean Payton believes in him. And when he does, he usually lets the quarterback play loose.The New England defense can be stingy, especially against the run, which can put more pressure on Payton to scheme up things to make it easier for Stidham. I think Payton is one of the best play callers in the league, so I think he will.On the other side, Drake Maye will be making his first road playoff start for the Patriots. That can be daunting, especially against a good Denver defense. But Maye has been good on the road this season. Then again, this is the playoffs.The Bills ran on the Broncos last week, so I expect the Patriots to try to do the same. New England is averaging 156.1 rushing yards per game over the last seven games, but I think Denver will be better this time against the run.It would be easy to pick the Pats here based on Stidham playing. But I think the Denver players will elevate their games around him and Payton will have a big day calling the game for him. I think Denver's defense will get the best of the Pats offense. Denver goes to the Super Bowl.Pick: Broncos 23, Patriots 21\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picks: Predicting winners for Broncos-Patriots AFC Championship and Rams-Seahawks NFC title game\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThese two split the season series in two really close games, with one point separating the two teams in the combined scores. The Seahawks rallied to win the last meeting in Seattle in Week 16 in overtime, which is why this game is at home.The Rams are playing a third straight road game, which is brutal, but teams have overcome that in the past in the playoffs. If any coach can get his team right for that, it's Rams coach Sean McVay.The Rams struggled some on offense last week in their victory over the Bears. This Seattle defense is much better than that Bears group. But Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has had success against them in the two games.The Seattle defense is the best unit of any left in the playoffs, which will challenge McVay to come up with new ways to move the football. The Rams lack great outside speed, and that showed up last week at Chicago. Keep an eye on that in this one. On the other side, the Rams defense has had some leakage issues in the secondary over the past six weeks. It is not a great group. The good news is Seattle wants to run it more than throw it.Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold is the key. If he can take care of the football, which he didn't do in a playoff loss to the Rams last year when he was with the Vikings, the Seahawks will win the game. I think he does. The Seattle defense is playing too good right now. That defensive front will disrupt the night for Stafford as the Seahawks get to the Super Bowl behind that defense.Pick: Seahawks 23, Rams 17\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The more they play, the more it seems to be Arsenal's year. The team coached by Mikel Arteta won 3-1 at San Siro against Inter on Tuesday on Matchday 7 of the Champions League, deploying another incredible performance that underlined once again why they are currently considered the best team around.With seven wins in seven games so far in the league phase of the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal are leading the standings and will likely end up as winners of the opening phase. After winning seven games in a row for the first time in their European history, scoring 20 goals and conceding just two, the Gunners look like the best team in the competition right now and could potentially win their first Premier League title in more than two decades as well. For that reason, it's hard to imagine them finishing the season without lifting at least one trophy in the coming months.\nThe game at San Siro showed, if possible, even more of their potential because of the choices made by Arteta in the starting 11. The Spanish coach decided to bench some of the key players of this team, including English midfielder Declan Rice and Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres, who came off the bench and scored the goal to make it 3-1 in the second half. While Arteta's selections appeared focused on prioritizing the Premier League, along with the rotations, he is forced to make do with playing every three days, and this game also highlighted the gap between Arsenal and Inter, the 2024–25 Champions League finalists.\nIt's quite obvious that both teams are kind of safe, considering their league phase standings. Arsenal are expected to end up as the winners of the league phase, which means they will play at home all the second games in the round of 16. On the other hand, if Inter don't end up in the top eight and will need to play the playoffs, they should probably take more responsibility for the two 1-0 defeats against Atletico Madrid away and against Liverpool at San Siro in December, more than Tuesday's defeat against Arsenal. At the same time, there is a persisting issue when Cristian Chivu's side meet a strong team. The Nerazzurri struggled every match they played against a top team in both Italy and Europe, and this is becoming a major issue for them ahead of the crucial stint of the 2025-26 season. \n        \n            \n                Champions League burning questions: Arsenal and Inter's set piece clash, are Real Madrid still contenders?\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpeaking to Sky Italy, Chivu showed his admiration for Arteta and the English side, saying, \"Arsenal impressed me more than any other team. They always make the right play and constantly cause you problems with Saka, they always make the right decisions. The Premier League is truly top in terms of intensity and in Italy we're not used to that. I'm trying to bring that aspect in, but it's not easy. We're trying to grow step by step, and we need to be convinced that we're doing the right things.\"\nIn Serie A, Chivu's side have struggled against top opposition, failing to beat Napoli (one loss and one draw) and losing to both AC Milan and Juventus. In Europe, after winning their opening four matches against Ajax, Slavia Prague, Kairat, and Union SG, they suffered defeats to Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, and Arsenal. Next week, they will face Borussia Dortmund in what will be a crucial match to avoid the playoffs, something Arsenal won't need to worry about this season. \n            ",

The English side are currently in 11th place with four wins and two defeats in the opening six games and winning against Roberto De Zerbi's side would be crucial to end up in the top eight and qualify directly for the round of 16. OM, on the other hand, also need a win to consolidate the top 24 and avoid a risky last match of the league phase when they will face Club Brugge away. Mo Salah is also back in the Liverpool squad after AFCON and it's time to see if what happened in December, when he was excluded from the squad traveling to Milan, when the Reds won 1-0 against Inter, is behind them. Arne Slot spoke about the Egyptian winger in the pre-match press conference: \"Of course, I spoke to him today and I'm happy to have him back because, as I said, this season I've only had two wingers who would tell me that is their favorite position, that have played more than 100 minutes in the Premier League. That's Mo and Cody Gakpo.\"Here's what you need to know ahead of the match against Liverpool that will take place on Tuesday: Viewing informationDate: Wednesday, Jan. 21 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Orange Velodrome -- MarseilleLive stream: Paramount+Odds: OM +270; Draw +275; Liverpool -107Possible lineupsOM XI: Geronimo Rulli; Benjamin Pavard, Leonardo Balerdi, Facundo Medina, Timothy Weah; Arthur Vermeeren, Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg, Emerson, Mason Greenwood; Igor Paixao, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.Liverpool XI:  Alisson Becker; Jeremie Frimpong, Joseph Gomez, Virgil van Dijk, Milos Kerkez; Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister; Dominik Szoboszlai, Curtis Jones, Florian Wirtz; Hugo Ekitike.PredictionThis is a difficult one to predict but I'm pretty sure it will be an eventful clash with a lot of action and goals.

    "body": "\n        Carlos Beltrán and Andruw Jones have been elected for induction into the 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame class. They will join Jeff Kent -- who was elected via the Contemporary Era Committee -- this summer in Cooperstown.As a reminder, players receiving at least 75% of the BBWAA vote are elected to the Hall of Fame, while those receiving less than 5% of the vote fall off the ballot before next year's vote. Players getting at least 5% of the vote can stay on the ballot for up to 10 years. Beltrán received 84.2% of the vote, while Jones got 78.4%.PlayerVote percentageCarlos Beltrán84.2Andruw Jones78.4Chase Utley59.1Andy Pettitte48.5Félix Hernández46.1Álex Rodríguez40Manny Ramírez38.8Bobby Abreu30.8Jimmy Rollins25.4Cole Hamels23.8Dustin Pedroia20.7Mark Buehrle20Omar Vizquel18.4David Wright14.8Francisco Rodríguez11.8Torii Hunter8.7Ryan Braun3.5Edwin Encarnación1.4Shin-Soo Choo0.7Matt Kemp0.5Hunter Pence0.5Rick Porcello0.5Alex Gordon0.2Nick Markakis0.2Gio González0Howie Kendrick0Daniel Murphy0Carlos BeltránBeltrán, 48, makes the Hall of Fame on his fourth try. He started with 46.5% of the vote in 2023 and progressively rose to this point. In parts of 20 seasons with the Royals, Mets, Giants, Cardinals, Yankees, Rangers and Astros, he hit .279/.350/.486 (119 OPS+) with 2,725 hits, 565 doubles, 435 home runs, 1,587 RBI, 1,582 runs and 312 stolen bases. He's 62nd in career hits, 41st in RBI, 53rd in runs, 34th in total bases, 25th in extra-base hits, 29th in doubles and 48th in home runs. He's one of 39 players ever to top 1,500 in both RBI and runs. He's one of just five to top 400 home runs and 300 steals along with Barry Bonds, Alex Rodríguez, Willie Mays and Andre Dawson. The nine-time All-Star won three Gold Gloves, two Silver Sluggers, a Rookie of the Year and a Roberto Clemente Award in his career. He didn't win a World Series until his final season, but in 65 career playoff games, he was a monster, slashing .307/.412/.609 with 15 doubles, 16 home runs, 42 RBI, 45 runs and 11 steals.\nThe résumé says Beltrán shouldn't have had the trouble he did getting into the Hall of Fame, but part of what held him back was his involvement in the 2017 Astros sign-stealing scandal. At 70.0 career WAR, Beltrán ranks 105th all time, 71st among position players and eighth among center fielders behind Mays, Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Mickey Mantle, Mike Trout, Ken Griffey Jr. and Joe DiMaggio. He now joins all of them -- except Trout, who will be there five years after he retires -- in the Hall of Fame.\n        \n            \n                Winners and losers of Baseball Hall of Fame voting: Good news for Chase Utley and Jose Altuve, Manny falls off\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAndruw JonesJones, incidentally, is also a center fielder. He sits 14th in the position group all time in WAR, though the JAWS system -- due to his outstanding peak -- is friendlier. He's 11th there. With Beltrán and Jones, there are now 21 Hall of Fame center fielders. \nJones, 48, completes a steady climb into the Hall of Fame after a very low percentage start. He got 7.3% of the vote in his first year and it took until his ninth to be elected. In parts of 17 seasons with the Braves, Dodgers, Rangers, White Sox and Yankees, he hit .254/.337/.486 (111 OPS+) with 1,933 hits, 383 doubles, 434 home runs, 1,289 RBI, 1,204 runs and 152 stolen bases. He led the league in home runs and RBI in 2005, finishing second in National League MVP voting. Despite some good offensive stats, where the 10-time Gold Glover earned his way into the Hall of Fame was on defense. He's generally considered one of the greatest defensive outfielders ever. It's always difficult to judge defense strictly on numbers, but Jones is 22nd all time in defensive WAR and he is first among outfielders. Yes, he's ranked as the best defensive outfielder ever. In total zone runs, he's second behind Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson.\nWorking against Jones before this year on the Hall of Fame vote was his late-career collapse (in his last five years, he hit .210/.316/.424 with a 95 OPS+ and 1.7 total WAR) and a post-retirement domestic violence arrest.What's next?Again, Beltrán and Jones join Kent as the three-man 2026 Baseball Hall of Fame class. They'll be inducted in Cooperstown on July 26.\n\n        \n            \n                Who will be on 2027 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot? Buster Posey headlines newcomers\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs for the rest of the ballot, Manny Ramirez was the only player in his 10th year, so he falls off in addition to the players who did not receive at least 5% of the vote, including Ryan Braun, Edwin Encarnación, Shin-Soo Choo, Matt Kemp and Hunter Pence. Thirteen holdovers will continue onto next year's ballot, including Chase Utley, Andy Pettitte, Félix Hernández and newcomer Cole Hamels.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When Jimmy Butler crumbled to the floor on Monday night and started dropping F bombs as he held his right knee, which was confirmed as a torn ACL on Tuesday, the Warriors' season, which was at least starting to trend upward, ended. You have to wonder if the same can be said for Golden State's Stephen Curry era. I know, on some level, it's too early to start talking about finality for a guy who is still nowhere near his end as a superstar player. But we're all thinking it. If the window for a fifth championship was still even slightly cracked, if only in theory, it has almost certainly shut short of two unlikely scenarios playing out. The first one would be trading Butler, which is unlikely but at least worth considering. Now you might be asking yourself, who would want to trade for a 36-year-old historically malcontent player who is on the books for almost $60 million next season and won't even be able to play for the next 10-12 months? A team with its own crappy contract to get rid of. Our Sam Quinn outlined some possible trades that would fit this construct, with Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid at the top of the list. Personally, I think the Sixers are starting to like their chances with a currently dominant Embiid in the East this year, even if it would probably be a smart move to get off that contract before the next inevitable injury arrives. \nBut let's say the Sixers would be up for it. Would the Warriors? Almost certainly not. Embiid is due $59.5 million next season, $64.3 million the season after that, and $69 million in 2028-29 when he'll be 34 and basically certain to be completely broken down. He's barely holding it together at 31. Even making it the remainder of this season healthy is a long shot. And that's before we even consider the fit of a lumbering big man in a Steph Curry offense. Davis is easier to envision. He's also a long shot to stay healthy through a playoff run (hell, he's not even healthy right now), but he's expected to be back this season and he comes off the books one year before Embiid even if he were to exercise his $62.7 million player option in 2027-28. At full strength, Davis is interesting enough to pacify the puncher's-chance fans even if there's almost no way he would actually stay healthy -- to say nothing of the issues he would pose as a clunky shooter next to Draymond Green. \nI'm sure the Kings would be open to talking about a deal for DeMar DeRozan or Domantas Sabonis for Butler and Jonathan Kuminga, whom Sacramento coveted this summer. If there is one trade that would possibly keep the Warriors in the contention picture this year and beyond, it might be Lauri Markannen. Unfortunately, Danny Ainge shows up to these meetings in a ski mask and the Warriors didn't hold onto their two-timeline dream this long just to get robbed. Who knows if the Warriors will even discuss these or any Butler deals, let alone actually pull one of them off. At the moment, GM Mike Dunleavy is saying he doesn't envision trading Butler. \nEven that's just a smokescreen designed to keep some form of leverage in a potential deal rather than announce your desperation, to convince yourself that all these pieces are just going to magically fall into perfect place, remain healthy, and deliver another championship run to team that currently resides in the No. 8 seed of a murderous Western Conference is a major reach. My dad would call it a pipe dream, and the older I get the more I realize that man is rarely wrong. \nAnd so, if a Butler trade either isn't going to happen or isn't going to put Curry in a realistic position to compete for a fifth career championship with the Warriors, then his only chance to do so would be with another team. Now, I have a lot of thoughts on the trading-a-franchise-icon front. First and foremost, you don't consider doing it for a second unless the player has either demanded out or the return is going to set up your next decade when your current window has closed. This is why Nico Harrison was a moron. The Luka Doncic trade didn't check either of those boxes. And Curry means incalculably more to the Warriors than Luka did to Dallas. Trading him would shake the Bay Area and greater basketball world to its core. Having said that, I grew up in Northern California, have been a Warriors fan all my life, hold Steph Curry, athletically speaking, in an almost religious regard, and I wouldn't have a problem with him finishing his career elsewhere. \nI'm a grown man with a family and bills. Sports don't impact my life like that anymore; they entertain me, and Curry gunning for No. 5 on the Rockets, just as an example, would entertain me greatly. Tampa Tom Brady was awesome. If Curry were to ever open up this relocation conversation, we can reopen the one about him possibly winning a fifth ring.For now, every indication he's ever given is that he places more value on finishing with the Warriors than possibly finishing with a fifth ring. That could change. Curry is as competitive as they come. He's still an elite player. The Warriors could still get a major return, much like Boston when it traded Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, that could set up the next era. Again, maybe a conversation will happen at some point. I seriously doubt it. Either way, until then, the best the Warriors can do is try to remain competitive over Curry's closing chapter (nobody wants to see the final Kobe years with the Lakers). They may even still make a Jonathan Kuminga margin move at the deadline. But here's the reality: The moment Butler hit the ground on Monday night, a lot more than just this season ended. It feels likely that Stephen Curry is done chasing championships with the Warriors.\n            ",

The former Miami Dolphins coach informed the Browns of his decision ahead of Wednesday's scheduled meeting. McDaniel was slated to meet with the Los Angeles Chargers on Tuesday regarding their offensive coordinator opening after the team fired Greg Roman shortly after their 16-3 loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC wild card round. McDaniel -- who reportedly has several offensive coordinator offers still on the table -- is still a candidate for the Baltimore Ravens and Las Vegas Raiders' head coaching openings. \nWith McDaniel out of the running, the Browns will move ahead in their search to find their next coach. The team has conducted second interviews with defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, former Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski, Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter and Los Angeles Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase. McDaniel, 42, enjoyed a successful albeit short run as the San Francisco 49ers' offensive coordinator before becoming the Dolphins' coach in 2022. After having early success in Miami that included consecutive playoff berths, McDaniel's teams went a combined 15-19 over the past two seasons. Overall, McDaniel compiled a 35-33 regular season record and an 0-2 playoff record during his four seasons with the Dolphins.\nMcDaniel is part of a competitive group of coaching candidates, a field that (in addition to the names listed above) also includes Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who has conducted interviews with the Ravens and Raiders. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons found their new coach as they agreed to terms with former Cleveland Browns lead man Kevin Stefanski last week to replace Raheem Morris. With Stefanski now in the NFC South, it means he's going to face off against his former quarterback twice a year in Baker Mayfield, who now stars for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Stefanski and Mayfield spent the 2020 and 2021 seasons together in Cleveland, and it's safe to say that their time together with the Browns did not end on good terms. Mayfield, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, spotted a social media post on Tuesday that claimed he failed the Browns during his four seasons with the organization and that he was a part of a \"dumpster fire\" of a quarterback room that Stefanski had to manage. Mayfield took exception and responded by firing a shot at his former coach: \"Failed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage. Can't wait to see you twice a year, Coach.\"\nMayfield has a point. He wasn't exactly a \"dumpster fire\" failure in Cleveland. In 2020, he led the Browns to an 11-5 record, which resulted in their first playoff appearance since 2002 and helped the franchise win its first playoff game since 1994. Cleveland hasn't won a playoff game since that wild card victory the Pittsburgh Steelers. However, Mayfield went 6-8 as the starter the following year as he tried to fight through a shoulder injury. That offseason, the Browns opted to join the Deshaun Watson sweepstakes and sent the Houston Texans a package of draft picks that included three first-round selections in exchange for Watson, who received a record five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract. It's regarded as one of the worst trades in NFL history, as Watson owns a 9-10 record as starter for the Browns, and hasn't played in more than seven games in any of the four years he's spent with Cleveland. \nMayfield apparently did not hear from Stefanski after the Browns ditched him for another quarterback, which clearly irked him. The quarterback struggled to find his footing after the breakup, as he was traded to the Carolina Panthers prior to the 2022 season and then released after just six starts. Mayfield finished the year with the Los Angeles Rams before the Buccaneers came calling with a one-year prove-it deal.In his first season with Tampa in 2023, Mayfield put up what were career-high numbers at the time with 4,044 passing yards, 28 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. It earned him his first multi-year extension, and Mayfield responded with another career year in 2024, throwing for 4,500 yards, 41 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. Since joining the Buccaneers, Mayfield is 27-24 as the starter, and has won the NFC South twice. \nUltimately, Mayfield can't be too upset with all that has happened. He got to watch his former coach be fired, and is in a much better place than the Browns these days. And on top of that, he'll now get to go against Stefanski twice per season. Buckle up. \n            ",

The injury, which came in the third quarter against the Miami Heat, will end Butler's season, the team announced Tuesday. Butler will undergo surgery at a to-be-determined date. With 7:41 left in the third quarter, Brandin Podziemski tried to float a post entry pass over the top to Butler, who had his man sealed; however, as he went up for the catch, Davion Mitchell collided with Butler, who came down awkwardly on his right leg. The immediate pain felt by Butler and the seriousness of the injury were obvious. \nOne can hear Butler scream in pain immediately, and he was unable to put any weight on the leg as teammates helped him to the locker room. All the Warriors said on Monday night was that Butler suffered a \"knee injury,\" though by early Tuesday morning reports indicated it was an ACL tear in his right knee.\nWith Butler's season officially over, Golden State's campaign might be as well. The Warriors (25-19 after Monday's win and currently eighth in the West) were already going to have to go on a big second-half run to crawl above the play-in line. \nWithout Butler, who was in the middle of a terrific season, there is little chance Stephen Curry and Co. can make a serious run in the playoffs with the currently constructed roster. Monday's development figures to impact Golden State's approach to the Feb. 5 trade deadline. Butler has one more season after this on his current contract, and he is owed $56.8 million next season before hitting free agency in the summer of 2027. The Warriors are also looking to move forward Jonathan Kuminga in the next two weeks.\nThe Warriors now are tied for the seventh-longest odds to win the West this season with a +5000 figure at DraftKings.\n            \n    ",

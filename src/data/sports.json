Surtain is believed to be week-to-week, but the Broncos have not lost their best defensive player for the season.In his reporting, Rapoport noted that Surtain could land on IR, meaning he would have to miss at least four games. Still, the Broncos are likely breathing a sigh of relief after seeing Surtain go down the tunnel Sunday.Surtain got banged up earlier in the game, when he camp up limp after defending Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens on an end zone target. Pickens was able to reenter the game and continued to play until suffering the pec injury.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 8 grades: Cowboys get 'F' for blowout loss to Broncos; Packers earn 'A-' for win over Steelers\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 2024 Defensive Player of the Year, Surtain is one of the NFL's elite cornerbacks. Through eight games this season, Surtain has tallied 27 tackles and nine pass break-ups. Going into Week 8, Surtain was only allowing a 48.5% completion rate, which ranked seventh among qualified players.The Broncos selected Surtain with the No. 9 overall pick in 2021, and he's more than lived up to the expectations of a top-10 pick. Surtain has become a shutdown defender in Denver's secondary, and he's earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2022 and 2024.\nWith Surtain out for a while, the Broncos will turn to Riley Moss and rookie Jahdae Barron, the No. 20 overall pick in 2025. Their first test without Surtain in the lineup will come this weekend against C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans.\n            \n    ",

The former Texas Tech standout continues to solidify his status among the NFL's best quarterbacks of all-time. In the 2024 season, he passed for 3,928 yards, threw 26 touchdowns against 11 interceptions, and finished with a passer rating of 93.5 over 16 games. Through the first seven games of the 2025 campaign, Mahomes has already thrown for 1,800 yards with 14 touchdowns and just two interceptions with a passer rating of 102.9. While his 2024 numbers dipped slightly compared to some of his peak seasons, the early returns in 2025 show a marked uptick in efficiency and ball control. Mahomes' also has 250 rushing yards and a team-high four rushing touchdowns in 2025. See who else to roster here.Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Samuel. The former South Carolina standout has gotten off to a solid start in his first season with the Commanders. In 2024, while still with the San Francisco 49ers, he recorded 51 receptions for 670 receiving yards -- an average of 13.1 yards per catch -- and scored three receiving touchdowns. In six games in 2025 with Washington, he has amassed 34 catches for 315 yards (an average of 9.3 yards per reception) and has already recorded three receiving touchdowns. He's also notched eight carries for 45 yards and a score on the ground. While his yardage per catch has decreased and overall production is down compared to his best seasons, the early touchdown pace and involvement in a new offense suggest he may be carving out a meaningful role despite the transition. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to build NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night FootballKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

    "description": "\n        Carson Wentz has been placed on injured reserve and will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan",
    "body": "\n        Carson Wentz has been placed on injured reserve and will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Wentz made five starts this season for the Vikings in relief of starting quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who is expected to return to the lineup for this week's game against the Detroit Lions. Along with McCarthy, the Vikings' quarterback room consists of Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie who will now move up to the No. 2 spot on the depth chart. Brosmer, who started for the Minnesota Gophers last season, has made three relief appearances this season, going 5 of 8 passing for 42 yards. Wentz played with considerable pain in his left (non-throwing) shoulder for more than half of his five starts, according to the Vikings' website. The former Pro Bowl quarterback appeared to be in obvious pain during Minnesota's most recent game, a 37-10 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that saw Wentz leave before its conclusion. A 10-year veteran, Wentz won two of his first three starts for the Vikings while filling in for McCarthy, who suffered a high-ankle sprain during Minnesota's Week 2 loss to the Falcons. \nWentz sustained his shoulder injury during the first half of the Vikings' Week 5 win over the Browns in London. Despite the injury, Wentz stayed in the game and ultimately led a game-winning drive that included him going 9 of 9 passing while throwing the game-winning touchdown pass to Jordan Addison with 25 seconds left. After using the Vikings' Week 6 bye to rehab his injury, Wentz tried but was unable to lead the Vikings to wins in their subsequent games against the Eagles (his former team) and Chargers. He pleaded with Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell to remain in last week's game against the Chargers despite being sacked five times and clearly being in pain. Wentz did his best, but it'll now be up to McCarthy to help turn the Vikings' season around. Minnesota is currently 3-4 and in last place in the NFC North.\nWhat does this mean for Wentz's future?For all intents and purposes, Wentz's Vikings career is probably a wrap. He was brought in as emergency insurance, and he was called upon to a great degree in a short amount of time. But he was uneven in dire circumstances, and he was always going to be a short-term Band-Aid anyway. Only a flawless and near-undefeated run would've convinced Vikings brass to pivot all the way off the McCarthy experiment, which has hardly left the ground.More than that, Wentz's injury-fueled exit may also spell the end of the quarterback's NFL career. That's mostly a result of the physical wear and tear he suffered behind Minnesota's shaky front. Imperfect as he may have been handling the ball as Kevin O'Connell's point guard, he showed enough in his brief Vikings tenure to warrant another backup gig somewhere else. It's just that he's also nearing his mid-30s after a decade of NFL service and took such a visible toll this year.Considering he waited quite a while to land his last two backup gigs, it's possible Wentz could decide that he's had his fill of taking a beating on the NFL stage. Then again, his own rugged persistence is part of the reason he suffered such serious shoulder injuries at all; maybe his never-say-die mentality will be enough to have him angling for one last opportunity in 2026.\nWhat does this mean for the Vikings?For one, it underscores the cold reality that Minnesota simply wasn't prepared to weather such turmoil under center. None of the club's individual quarterback decisions -- letting Sam Darnold walk, declining to pursue Aaron Rodgers with full conviction, etc. -- was egregious on its own. But Wentz ended up becoming a sort of sacrificial lamb in the wake of McCarthy's unreadiness.What we don't talk enough about is the fact [Wentz was] at the center of Minnesota's conundrum -- to hurry McCarthy back or to pivot to undrafted rookie Max Brosmer? -- despite only joining the team on Aug. 24. Look, some quarterbacks can turn around and help a franchise stay afloat on a few days' notice (see: Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals, at least briefly). But the Bengals had Joe Burrow as their Plan A. The Vikings had McCarthy, a total unknown.What's done is done. The Vikings made 2025 about McCarthy. And then McCarthy sputtered out of the gate before going down (again). It should be no surprise, a few weeks later, they're hurting to get things under control at the quarterback position, not so unlike halfway through the 2023 season when Kirk Cousins was sidelined and O'Connell was left to squeeze what he could from Joshua Dobbs, another last-minute backup addition, and assorted leftovers.\n        \n            \n                Did the Vikings botch their QB situation? Reassessing Minnesota's now-bumpy bet on J.J. McCarthy, backup plans\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPractically, however, Wentz's move to injured all but ensures McCarthy will make his long-awaited return sooner rather than later. Visiting Detroit to take on the vaunted Lions in Week 9 probably isn't the launching pad the Vikings had in mind for their second-year signal-caller coming off injury, but then again, nothing has really gone according to plan at the position. McCarthy, meanwhile, may get somewhat of a pass if he isn't lights out in his first game(s) back. But he'll also be under serious pressure to make good on the 2025 campaign as Year 2 of his rookie contract quickly fades away.And if he can't stay on the field again? Brosmer, the former Golden Gophers prospect, may well be the next name we're discussing as the unfortunate face of the Vikings' offense.\n            ",

The Commanders scored 41 points in Mariota's first start of the season and 27 in his second, so the veteran has led successful drives this season.

    "body": "\n        Stop us if you've heard this before: The Browns wasted a Myles Garrett masterpiece Sunday.Cleveland's superstar edge rusher recorded a franchise-record five sacks (as well as one forced fumble), wreaking havoc on Drake Maye and the Patriots all game long. He beat double teams. He made a mockery of one-on-one scenarios. He won from the left side and the right. He chased down Maye, an outstanding athlete, on multiple occasions.It didn't matter much. The Browns lost 32-13 to fall to 2-6, even with Garrett recording just the 20th five-sack game in NFL history. Entering Sunday, players with a five-sack game had a 16-3 record. None of the three players who lost had lost by more than three points. The Browns lost by 19.So even though Garrett's highlights are absurd, the clip that's gained the most attention is this one of him slamming his helmet late in the defeat.\nHe sat by himself at the end of the bench as the clock wound down, and afterwards, he was matter-of-fact about his frustration.\"It doesn't get any easier each week you ask me,\" Garrett said regarding the team's inability to create an offense conducive to winning football games.\"I would throw the whole performance away for a win,\" he said about his own accomplishments.\nThe Browns are 55-84-1 since Garrett arrived as the top pick in 2017, the seventh-worst mark in the NFL over that span, and have made the postseason just twice. The team has churned through 15 starting quarterbacks over that span, though it doesn't appear that No. 16 is on the way after head coach Kevin Stefanski said he'll stick with struggling rookie Dillon Gabriel after the bye.That frustration played a part in Garrett requesting a trade in early February. By the end of the month, reports emerged that he was unwilling to sign a contract extension with the franchise. In early March, reports emerged that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam wouldn't meet with Garrett, who was considering sitting out games.But two days after that report, Garrett signed a four-year, $160 million extension with Cleveland. At $40 million per year, it made Garrett the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time. Later in the offseason, another pass rusher, Micah Parsons, took that throne. Notably, though, that payday came after the Cowboys granted his trade request, shipping him to the Packers in a stunning blockbuster deal.\nSunday's outburst and comments show Garrett's frustration has boiled over again. With the trade deadline nearing, it's only natural to wonder if Garrett, tied for the NFL lead with 10.0 sacks, could be on the move. A deeper examination, though, shows it won't happen.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Rams bolster defense\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGarrett's frustration with Browns\"As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl -- and that goal fuels me today more than ever,\" Garrett said in a Feb. 3 statement when he requested his trade from the Browns. \"My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today.\"While I've loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won't allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl.\n\"With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.\"That second-to-last sentence seemed especially pertinent -- and a bit of a shot. Garrett's trade request came roughly a week after general manager Andrew Berry said he had no intentions of trading Garrett and \"we envision him going from Cleveland to Canton when his career is over.\"Canton, of course, is where the Pro Football Hall of Fame resides. Garrett is undoubtedly on that path. He's a six-time All-Pro (four-time first-team selection) and six-time Pro Bowler. He won the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year, between finishing in the award's top five in 2022 and 2024. He's tied for the NFL lead with 10.0 sacks this season and, at 29 years old, has shown no signs of slowing down.As has been the case throughout much of his career, the Browns are struggling. After losing to the Bengals 17-16 in Week 1 -- kicker Andre Szmyt missed an extra point and a short field goal -- Cleveland got blown out by Baltimore 47-10, and Garrett couldn't hide his frustration.\n\"I mean, this shit is embarrassing,\" Garrett said after the Browns allowed 31 second-half points. \"We got to be better on defense. We got to be better as a team. They slowly chipped away and we did a solid job, holding them to three when we could, and then eventually the dam broke and they just did whatever they wanted, and we have to continue to play a 60-minute game.\"Could the Browns actually trade him?The short answer is technically \"yes.\" There is no rule that's stopping them. But let's make this clear: The Browns won't trade Garrett this season.There are several issues at play. First, there's the financial aspect. Trading Garrett would trigger a dead cap hit of nearly $68 million for the 2026 season. For reference, the largest single-season dead money hit in NFL history is Russell Wilson's $53 million, stemming from the Broncos cutting ties with him in 2024.\nThen there's the return.\"That's probably more of an offseason consideration when Cleveland could maximize draft choice compensation,\" said Joel Corry, a former NFL agent and current CBS Sports analyst, via text last month. \"I'm assuming Myles Garrett would be more likely to waive his no trade clause for an expected playoff contender.\"He is making $31.5M in 2026. The trade would have to be within the first 15 days of the 2026 league year because that's when a $29.2 million payment is due to exercise a dummy (voiding) 2031 contract year.\"That is the biggest difference between the Parsons trade and any potential Garrett move. Garrett has already been paid. Parsons hadn't been.\nIt's easy to see why Garrett is frustrated. No one likes losing. No one likes seeing historic performances go to waste. But Garrett knew a season like this was a likely reality when he signed his then-record-breaking deal. He will have to stick out another lost season in Cleveland.\n            ",

The move reunites Lockett with his former quarterback (Geno Smith) and coach (Pete Carroll) from their days together with the Seattle Seahawks. Lockett reportedly asked for his release from the Titans after catching just 10 passes for 70 yards in his first seven games played this year. He signed a one-year deal with Tennessee this offseason, but the Titans were more interested in playing some of their younger players. Lockett ranked fifth on the team in targets, behind rookies Elic Ayomanor and Chimere Dike.The Raiders were always viewed as a top landing spot given Lockett's connection to the coach and quarterback -- Smith and Lockett played for the Seahawks from 2020-2024 -- but the Raiders also needed a new weapon. This offense ranks third-worst in the NFL (276.4 total yards per game), sixth-worst in passing (182.7 yards per game) and second-worst in scoring (13.8 points per game). Tre Tucker is the Raiders' leading receiver with 389 yards and four touchdowns. Those 389 yards receiving ranks No. 36 in the NFL. Smith has thrown a league-high 10 interceptions, and his 77.1 passer rating ranks No. 31 among 33 qualified quarterbacks this season. The Raiders are on a bye but coming off an embarrassing 31-0 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7. The Raiders recorded just 95 yards of total offense in that loss and ran 30 plays -- the fewest by any team in a game since the Cleveland Browns ran 28 plays in a game back in 1999.\nLockett left Seattle as the franchise's No. 2 all-time leading receiver, having caught 661 passes for 8,594 yards and 61 touchdowns. He is not going to spark the Raiders offense by himself, but Lockett does have established chemistry with a quarterback that has been struggling.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL trade deadline is fast approaching and the Los Angeles Rams are getting a head start on improving their roster for a run at the NFC West. The Rams acquired cornerback Roger McCreary and a 2026 conditional sixth-round pick from the Tennessee Titans in exchange for 2026 conditional fifth-round pick.This deal isn't for one of the premier players available at the deadline, but signals the Titans are starting to sell off their roster after a dreadful 1-7 start. the Rams are on their bye week at 5-2 and are a contender for the NFC West title. So who won the trade? Or was this an opportunity for the Titans to sell off pieces during the rebuild? Let's take a quick look at the trade grades and how did deal benefits both franchises.Rams: B+The Rams needed help at outside cornerback once Ahkello Witherspoon broke his clavicle in Week 2, as Los Angeles has tried several options at the position in Witherspoon's absence. Emmanuel Forbes, Cobie Durant, and Darious Williams have taken the bulk of the reps -- but to mixed results. \nForbes has allowed two touchdowns and a 118.3 passer rating in coverage as the primary defender in the five games Witherspoon has missed. Williams has allowed one touchdown and a 59.7 passer rating in coverage while Durant has allowed 205 pass yards and a 64.6 rating in that same span. Only Durant has a takeaway, which has been an issue for the Rams secondary. Durant has the only interception by a cornerback on the Rams defense. Will McCreary help with the turnover issues? He has just one interception on the season in 184 coverage snaps, allowing an 87.8 passer rating as the primary defender. He's a proven starting cornerback with 38 career starts under his belt, and is now outside the Tennessee realm of doing things. The 25-year-old McCreary is in the final year of his rookie contract and will get an opportunity to prove he deserves an extension with a starting job in Los Angeles.McCreary can play the outside or the slot, and the Rams need help at both. All the Rams gave up was a fifth-round pick, which was originally the Titans anyway. This is a good buy-low deal.\nTitans: CHard to see why the Titans are giving up on young players, but perhaps McCreary wouldn't have been back anyway. McCreary was drafted when Jon Robinson was the Titans general manager, and that was three general managers ago. With a new head coach coming this offseason, who knows the scheme the new defensive coordinator will have -- or whether McCreary is a part of the future anyway? McCreary did seem to find his footing after a poor rookie year in which the former second-round pick allowed seven passing touchdowns, but he never seemed to be a fit in Tennessee. This is more of a product of the titans front office structuring than the player, and Tennessee will be selling off players in a lost season where the head coach was fired in October. This deal is expected to be the first in a fire sale for the Titans, as they look for their new head coach over the next several months. Only getting a fifth-round pick back -- and giving up a sixth -- for McCreary is better than nothing. This just shows the position the tItans are in, and how little they will get for solid players on their roster. \nIf McCreary figures things out with the Rams, that's an even bigger indictment of the Titans and how they develop players. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin insists he's not in it for the paycheck. With two of college football's premier jobs now open -- Florida and LSU -- speculation has again turned toward the Ole Miss coach, whose name reliably surfaces anytime the sport's power programs go searching. But Kiffin made it clear Monday that financial offers won't dictate his next move.\"Just so you know, because you haven't known me very long, I have never made a decision based off money, nor will I,\" Kiffin said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"For a lot of people, they're just like, 'Well, money, and it does this and does that.' \"I've seen too many examples in life where money does not buy happiness. So I'm never going to make a decision off of money, nor do I care about it. (My agent) Jimmy Sexton gets really mad when I say that. He's like, 'We got to get this. We got to get this.' And, I'm like, 'Jimmy, I don't care.' And he goes, 'I do!'\"Kiffin's comments arrive as he guides No. 6 Ole Miss into the heart of the College Football Playoff race. The Rebels' 34-26 win at Oklahoma on Saturday improved their record to 8-1, keeping alive hopes for the program's first CFP berth -- and, in turn, heightening interest in their high-profile head coach.\n        \n            \n                LSU coaching candidates: Lane Kiffin, Dabo Swinney among options on hot board to replace Brian Kelly\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBoth Florida and LSU dismissed their coaches this week, entering what's expected to be the most competitive hiring cycle in recent memory. Florida moved on from Billy Napier on Oct. 19 amid another disappointing start to the 2025 season, while LSU parted ways with Brian Kelly, who is owed nearly $54 million, on Sunday.\nKiffin, long dubbed the \"Portal King\" for his aggressive use of the transfer market, would be an attractive option for either school in an effort of a quick rebuild. But timing could complicate matters: the early signing period opens Dec. 4, with playoff games starting Dec. 19 -- leaving little room for schools to wait on a coach competing deep into the postseason.Kiffin has been through this before. Auburn pursued him aggressively in 2022 before he ultimately chose to stay at Ole Miss, a decision he later credited his daughter, Landry Kiffin, for influencing.\nWhether his stance holds as Florida and LSU boosters prepare their pitches remains to be seen. But as the coaching carousel begins to spin, Kiffin is adamant about one thing: his happiness isn't necessarily for sale.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Baltimore Orioles have hired Craig Albernaz as their new manager, the team announced Monday. Albernaz, 42, served last season as the Cleveland Guardians' associate manager under Stephen Vogt. Prior to that, Albernaz was major league field coordinator for the Guardians. In earlier years, Albernaz was bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants and also coached and managed at various levels within the Tampa Bay Rays farm system. As a player, the Massachusetts native spent parts of nine seasons in the minors as a catcher within the Rays and Detroit Tigers organizations. He reached as high as Triple-A. Albernaz inherits an Orioles team that still has a strong core of position players all in their twenties. However, the Orioles despite lots of talent finished a disappointing 75-87 this season and placed last in the American League East. Coming off consecutive postseason berths in 2023 and 2024, expectations were much higher. Those expectations cost manager Brandon Hyde his job in the middle of May. Interim replacement Tony Masolino managed a winning record over the remainder of the season (60-59), but ultimately lead decision-maker Mike Elias decided to go in another direction for dugout leadership. As such, the 2026 season brings with it a certain degree of pressure on both Elias and Albernaz to get the Orioles back into contending mode and win a playoff series for the first time in more than a decade. Elias' lack of aggressiveness in trading prospects for near-term roster needs and the lack of payroll investment from ownership remain impediments. \nNow that the Orioles are poised to name Albernaz to their post, the list of teams in need of managers for 2026 is down to five: the San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, and Minnesota Twins. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle took the NFL by storm when he filled for an injured Chuba Hubbard earlier this month. Dowdle ended up recording 389 rushing yards in two games as the team's starter while Hubbard was dealing with a calf strain.With Hubbard back on the field, there have been questions pertaining to how the team will divvy up carries. During Monday's media availability, Panthers coach Dave Canales expressed confidence in both ball carriers, but admitted that Dowdle's success has been hard to ignore.\"Chuba has meant a lot to this organization and certainly to the identity that we want to build our team on. We wanted to give Chuba the opportunity to go out and continue impact our team in a positive way (when he returned),\" Canales said. \"We cannot ignore the fact that Rico has been exceptional in the couple of games. In the opportunities that he's had over the last two weeks, he's made some excellent plays. Love the tempo and violence that he's running with...These are conversations that we definitely have to have.\"\n        \n            \n                Ed Oliver injury: Bills star DT out indefinitely with torn biceps, will undergo surgery\n                \n                    Chris Bengel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSince seeing an increase in volume when Hubbard was injured, Dowdle has rushed for 522 yards and 6.7 yards per carry to go along with a touchdown. In the two games that Hubbard missed, Dowdle received 53 carries that he turned into rushing performances of 206 and 183 yards, respectively.\nIn Carolina's 13-6 win against the New York Jets in Week 7, Hubbard made his return and the Panthers have been using both backs since then. \"Whether it's 70/30, 50/50, 100 my, or 100 Rico's way -- whatever it is, my focus is on winning,\" Hubbard added, per The Charlotte Observer. \"Obviously, this has been a topic of conversation for the last few weeks. But my main focus is never solely about me. It's always about the team and winning teams. So like I said, I pride myself on my work, and just helping my team get what needs to be done. And whatever that looks like, I've always been committed to that since I've been in Carolina.\"In two games, Hubbard has carried the ball 16 times for 65 yards (4.0 yards per carry), while Dowdle has tallied 25 attempts for 133 yards (5.3 yards per carry). Hubbard just edged out Dowdle in rushing attempts in Sunday's 40-9 loss to the Buffalo Bills as he registered 12 carries compared to Dowdle's eight.\nBased on the past two weeks, Dowdle has been the more productive asset out of the Carolina backfield. However, the Panthers do have Hubbard locked up long-term after signing Hubbard to a four-year, $33.2 million contract extension in November 2024. Meanwhile, Dowdle signed a one-year, $2.75 million deal with the Panthers this past offseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\nA 2-1 lead in the 2025 World Series will be on the line when the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers collide in Game 3 on Monday night at Dodger Stadium. In Game 1 on Friday, the Blue Jays scored nine runs in the sixth inning, including a pinch-hit grand slam from Addison Barger, in an 11-4 rout. One day later the Dodgers got a complete game from Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who limited to Toronto to four hits, in a 5-1 victory that evened the series at 1-1.Monday's Game 3 pitching matchup will feature Los Angeles righty Tyler Glasnow (0-0, 0.68 ERA) taking on future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer (1-0, 3.18 ERA) of Toronto. Glasnow has allowed one run or fewer in five of his last six starts, including his last one, in Game 3 of the NLCS, a 3-1 victory against the Brewers. The Dodgers have won each of Glasnow's last six starts.Scherzer, who played for Los Angeles in 2021, is set to become the first pitcher in MLB history to pitch for four teams in the World Series (Tigers, Nationals, Rangers and Blue Jays). He has one start this postseason, Toronto's win in Game 4 of the ALCS against the Mariners. He allowed two earned runs on three hits while striking out five and walking four in 5 2/3 innings. The Dodgers are a -200 money line favorite in Game 3, while the Blue Jays are a +175 underdog. Los Angeles has been dominant in the playoffs, having gone 10-2. From the mound, the Dodgers have limited opponents to one run or fewer in five of their past six games. They have received contributions up and down the lineup led by Shohei Ohtani, who has six home runs this postseason, which is tied for the second most in one playoffs in franchise history.Toronto, which led the majors during the regular season in batting average (.265), has stayed hot at the plate. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has the most hits (22) in a postseason in Blue Jays history. Ernie Clement is riding an eight-game hit streak, and George Springer has gone 3-for-8 over the first two games of the World Series. Game 3s have historically been crucial in best-of-seven series in MLB history. When tied 1-1 in the 2-3-2 format, teams that grabbed a 2-1 lead at home have prevailed in the series 29 of 48 times (60.4%). Meanwhile, teams that have taken a 2-1 lead on the road have prevailed 31 of 41 times (75.7%). While Game 3 of the World Series is the marquee attraction on the sporting landscape on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes Monday Night Football and an 11-game NBA slate. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Oct. 27. All times Eastern.MLB best bets, where to watchWorld Series Game 3: Blue Jays at DodgersTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Blue Jays +1.5 -121 | Expert: Under 8.5 -122 (Bruce Marshall)\nThe 41-year-old Scherzer has recently faced questions whether he would retire after this season. He's not under contract for next season, so the possibility exists Monday's game is the last for Scherzer, who was his vintage self in the ALCS against Seattle. He is 1-0 with a 3.26 ERA in four career World Series starts. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every MLB game 10,000 times, says Toronto has a 64% chance to cover and assigns an \"A\" grade to Blue Jays +1.5 (-121). Meanwhile, Marshall notes Toronto has scored in just three of 18 innings thus far this series. \"For Monday, vet Max Scherzer is a viable option for Toronto after his Game 4 effort vs. Seattle, while L.A.'s Tyler Glasnow has been tough to hit lately, as his 0.68 postseason ERA suggests,\" he says.NFL best bets, where to watchCommanders at ChiefsTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Kansas City | TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Commanders +11 | Expert: Commanders +12.5 -109 (R.J. White)\nThe reigning three-time defending AFC champions Kansas City Chiefs will try to stay hot when they battle the Washington Commanders in the Monday Night Football game at Arrowhead Stadium. After losing their first two games of the season, the Chiefs have won four of their last five. They are coming off a 31-0 whipping of the hapless Raiders. Meanwhile, the Commanders (3-4) have lost three of their last four.

His four rushing touchdowns in 2025 already tie a career-high, and his 35.7 rushing yards per game tops his previous career-high by 11.3 yards per game.

With Austin Ekeler going down early in the season, Croskey-Merritt is now at the top of the depth chart, and he's already scored four times in his first seven games. The model predicts that he scores 0.46 touchdowns on average, while the odds imply a 30.8% chance to score. Get $200 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose:Want more Week 8 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL longshot picks for Week 8.

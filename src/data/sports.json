    "body": "\n        From one glance at the Championship Week college football odds, there is a clear outlier amongst the Power 4 title games. That's over in the Big 12, which has Texas Tech favored by 12.5 points over BYU, per the latest Championship Week college football lines. Meanwhile, the other power conference championship games all have college football spreads of 4.5 points or fewer. They include Georgia vs. Alabama (+1.5) in the SEC, Ohio State vs. Indiana (+4.5) in the Big Ten and Virginia vs. Duke (+3.5) in the ACC.Whether you prefer to make Championship Week college football bets on smaller lines or larger college football spreads is a matter of preference. However, having the proper college football betting advice will set you up for success during the conference championship schedule.

Saturday at 7 p.m. ET. No team has a better point differential than IU (+401), which is 50 points greater than what Ohio State has. Indiana also has the Heisman favorite in Fernando Mendoza, who leads FBS with 32 passing touchdowns, while topping the Big Ten in total touchdowns and yards per attempt. His counterpart, Julian Sayin, has thrown picks in his last two games away from home, and the Buckeyes haven't won the turnover battle in five straight games. In addition to the Hoosiers sticking within the spread, the model also says the Over hits more than 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Duke (+3.5, 57.5) covers versus No. 16 Virginia in the ACC Championship Game on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET. The model projects the Blue Devils to cover almost 60% of the time. While UVA prevailed when these teams met on Nov. 8, the Cavs' offense is limping into this rematch. UVA averaged 36.4 points over its first nine games but is averaging over 13 fewer points over its last three. Meanwhile, Duke is coming off a season-high of 49 points in a victory over 8-win Wake Forest, as the Blue Devils have one of the most efficient offenses around. They rank 19th in the nation, and second in the ACC, with 34.6 ppg, and only two teams in all of FBS have thrown fewer interceptions. Virginia has as many turnovers (five) over its last three games as Duke has over its last nine games, and the turnover margin is one reason why Duke sticks within the spread. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Championship WeekThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every Championship Week matchup, and it's calling for another upset on Saturday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which underdog is projected to win outright?

Three of the teams that Houston defeated during its win streak are current AFC playoff squads in Jacksonville, Buffalo and Indianapolis. Meanwhile, the single best unit on the field come Sunday, and arguably in all of the NFL, is Houston's defense. It has allowed both the fewest points and fewest yards, and the Texans are the only NFL team which hasn't allowed more touchdown passes than it has defensive interceptions. Just five teams have more sacks than Houston (34), and it gets to face a Chiefs squad that's allowed three-plus sacks in five straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Chiefs can coverOne can't ignore Kansas City's five straight wins over Houston, with the four of those at home all coming by at least eight points. This year's Chiefs have balance, as one of six teams to rank in the top 10 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, while Houston has the No. 21 scoring offense. Kansas City is also extremely efficient, as it's committed the second-fewest turnovers, and Patrick Mahomes is having one of his finest seasons. He ranks second in the league in QBR, third in passing yards and fifth in passing touchdowns. Mahomes has also carved up the Texans like no other over his career as across six games versus Houston, the two-time MVP owns a 15:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. See which team to back at SportsLine.Missouri sports betting is now live.

The most expensive players to use for NFL DFS lineups are Jonathan Taylor, De'Von Achane, Bijan Robinson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Puka Nacua and Ja'Marr Chase.Are those NFL DFS picks worth paying up for, and which daily Fantasy football sleepers should you consider?

Cook is on pace for career highs in carries and rushing yardage as he currently ranks second in the NFL in both categories with 231 and 1,228. Though he might not hit his lofty 16-touchdown mark from last year, he still has scored eight times on the ground. He gets a dream matchup against the Bengals, who have given up more Fantasy points to opposing running backs than any other team. Cook is just the fourth-most expensive back on DraftKings, making him a strong value at that price point. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also rostering Cardinals receiver Michael Wilson at $5,700 on FanDuel and $5,600 on DraftKings. The third-year pro has put together a career-best 50-570-1 receiving line this season, and he's found a new gear the past few weeks with Jacoby Brissett taking over at quarterback. Wilson has been targeted a combined 40 times over the past three weeks, making 28 catches for 339 yards during that span.

    "body": "\n        The top two teams in the country meet in the 2025 Big Ten Championship Game when the second-ranked Indiana Hoosiers battle the top-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on Saturday. Indiana is coming off a 56-3 win at Purdue on Nov. 28, while Ohio State defeated Michigan 27-9 on Nov. 29. The Hoosiers (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten), who are appearing in their first Big Ten title game, are 2-0 against ranked opponents this season. The Buckeyes (12-0, 9-0 Big Ten), the defending national champions, are playing in their seventh conference championship game. A win virtually locks up the top seed in the College Football Playoff field for either side. The loser, meanwhile, remains an essential lock to be in the field and is widely projected to still earn a first-round bye. Kickoff from Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis is at 8 p.m. ET. The Buckeyes are 4-point favorites in the latest Ohio State vs. Indiana odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 46.5 via SportsLine consensus.

Indiana…not so much. The Hoosiers were the No. 20-ranked team in the preseason polls, while Ohio State was coming off a national championship. Both teams enter Saturday with 12-0 records, but Indiana didn't face nearly as grueling of a schedule as Ohio State to reach that mark. Indiana has only two victories over ranked opponents this season, and one came against a No. 9 Illinois team at the time that finished 8-4 and unranked. Meanwhile, Ohio State defeated Texas, which was the preseason No. 1 team in the nation, 14-7 in its opener at a neutral site and closed the year with a 27-9 win at No. 15 Michigan in The Game. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza may be the No. 1 pick in the upcoming NFL Draft, but Ohio State simply has too much talent all over the field for the Hoosiers.

Also, one can't dismiss that Georgia last played on Friday, with Bama on Saturday, and the Tide have covered just once over their last six games when having a rest disadvantage. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Alabama can coverBama has two streaks in its favor over Georgia, starting with the fact that the Tide are 4-0 all-time versus the Bulldogs in the SEC Title Game. Additionally, Alabama has won each of its last three meetings with UGA, with two of those coming since Kalen DeBoer replaced Nick Saban. This season, the Crimson Tide are 8-4 ATS, whereas the Bulldogs are just 5-7 versus the line, including failing to cover in each of their last two games. Bama quarterback, Ty Simpson, owns a 25:4 TD:INT, and he's complemented by a defense which has been its typical dominant self as of late. The Tide haven't allowed more than two touchdowns in each of their last five games, and they'll see a team on Saturday that has a negative turnover differential on the season. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Alabama vs. Georgia picksSportsLine's model has simulated Georgia vs. Alabama 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        A spot in the College Football Playoff bracket is on the line for the No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers when they meet the Duke Blue Devils in the 2025 ACC Championship Game on Saturday. The Cavaliers finished the regular season 10-2 overall with a 7-1 ACC record. They now have an inside track for an automatic CFP bid as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions if they can get by the Blue Devils. Kickoff from Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte is at 8 p.m. ET. The Cavaliers are 4-point favorites in the latest Virginia vs. Duke odds, while the over/under is 57.5.

Now they are small favorites a few weeks later on the neutral field. The Cavaliers also have more to play for as they are in line to head to the playoffs with a win. A Duke win guarantees the unranked Blue Devils very little since there's a good chance they would not be one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Virginia is a well-rounded squad that ranks second in the ACC in total defense and and fourth in total offense, so the Cavaliers are well-positioned to control this game and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Duke can cover Duke's defense has struggled at times, but the Blue Devils have an extremely explosive offense that can keep this game within the number. Duke ranks second in the ACC in scoring offense, and that's largely thanks to quarterback Darian Mensah, who has completed 67.5% of his passes this season for 3,450 yards, 28 touchdowns and just four interceptions. The running back duo of Nate Sheppard and Anderson Castle is one of the ACC's best, combining for 1,300 yards and 20 touchdowns on the ground. Cooper Barkate is one of the ACC's top receivers with a 63-978-6 line on the season. The Blue Devils appear to be the healthier team as well with Virginia ruling out 15 players and listing third-leading receiver Cam Ross among four players who are questionable. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Duke vs. Virginia picksSportsLine's model is going Under on the total.

    "body": "\n        The penultimate UFC event of 2025 takes place on Saturday night, when UFC 323 lands at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The card is headlined by Merab Dvalishvili's quest to set the record for most consecutive bantamweight title defenses as he faces Petr Yan in a rematch.Dvalishvili defeated Yan by decision in March 2023. That fight marked former bantamweight champion Yan's third consecutive defeat. Since then, Yan turned his career around and enters Saturday's fight riding a three-fight winning streak. After losing his first two UFC fights, Dvalishvili has won 14 consecutive fights, including winning the title from Sean O'Malley in September 2024 and defending the title three times thus far in 2025.Bet UFC 323 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:In the night's co-main event, Alexandre Pantoja will defend the flyweight championship against Joshua Van. Pantoja is on a dominant run, winning the title in July 2023 and making four successful defenses to date. Van has had a breakout 2025, winning three fights between March and June to earn a shot at the title.\nThe undercard also features some veterans looking to get back to the title level. Former flyweight king Brandon Moreno is back when he takes on rising contender Tatsuro Taira. Plus, former two-division champ Henry Cejudo is back in what could be his final fight when he takes on top prospect Payton Talbott at bantamweight. And former light heavyweight champion Jan Blachowicz is back to open the PPV festivities when he takes on Bodgan Guskov at 205 pounds. \n        \n            \n                At 35, the ageless Alexandre Pantoja wants to be recognized as the best in MMA before he calls it quits\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs with any UFC pay-per-view event, there's sure to be plenty of action at the sportsbook window, and with that in mind, we are taking a look at the best bet to make for every main card fight at UFC 323.After going 3-2 for our best bets for UFC 322, our 2025 record sits at 30-22. We'll look keep our roll going to close out the year on Saturday, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.\nJan Błachowicz\tvs.\tBogdan Guskov Jan Blachowicz moneyline (-130)In addition to being the more technical and well-rounded fighter, Blachowicz has the clear edge in higher-level experience. Guskov is a guy who can end a fight in a flash, but he does so by relying on walking forward and firing heavy right hands. That has worked more than it has not for Guskov, but when it doesn't work, he has nights like he had in his UFC debut against Volkan Oezdemir, where he walked forward into big punches the entire fight. Guskov has rattled off four consecutive stoppage victories since that night, but Blachowicz is a big step up, even if Blachowicz has gone 0-2-1 in his three most recent fights. Blachowicz has rounded out his game enough that he should be able to mix strong counterstriking with the threat of takedowns to edge out the win, so long as he avoids eating the one big shot Guskov will be looking to unload.Henry Cejudo\tvs.\tPayton TalbottFight to end by decision (-225)The loss to Raoni Barcelos was a bad night for Talbott, but that felt more like an aberration than who Talbott is as a fighter. Talbott has a solid striking game, where he throws shots with creativity and speed. Talbott's grappling is solid outside of holes in his defensive wrestling that Barcelos was able to exploit. Talbott looked much better coming back from that loss in his clear win over Felipe Lima. Cejudo at his best probably beats Talbott, but Cejudo's best days are behind him as he's on a three-fight losing skid and seems to have less explosiveness in his striking. Despite his Olympic credentials, Cejudo has never been at his best as a straight-up wrestler in the Octagon. Talbott's ability to grapple off his back, combined with his length and striking, should be enough to get the win. Despite that, the better bet here seems to be the fight going to the decision, with both fighters talented enough to drag things out to the scorecards.Brandon Moreno\tvs.\tTatsuro TairaBrandon Moreno moneyline (+110)Taira is a good fighter, to be clear. His lone loss came two fights ago with a split decision defeat to Brandon Royval. Moreno also dropped a split to Royval, that loss coming three fights ago. Moreno's list of big wins is clearly more impressive than that of Taira, so this becomes a question of whether Taira is ready to break through into the elite of the UFC flyweight division. The fact that you can get Moreno as a slight underdog feels good here. At his best, Moreno is dynamic and able to take over a fight anywhere it ends up. Taira has every chance of winning this fight -- and it should be a great fight to watch -- but Moreno's skills combined with an attractive line at +110 is enough to fire a bet his direction.\nAlexandre Pantoja vs.\tJoshua VanAlexandre Pantoja moneyline (-250)Pantoja comes in at -250, so as heavy a favorite as we allow in best bets. At 24, Van feels like a future champion, but this is the present. And, as of now, Pantoja is king of the flyweights. Pantoja is far more proven as a finisher against UFC-level competition, with eight finishes in 17 UFC fights (47%). Van, meanwhile, has only picked up two finishes in nine trips to the Octagon (22%). Pantoja has also done that against higher-level competition than Van has faced in his career. Pantoja has the wrestling and grappling to nullify Van's sharp striking, which is why Pantoja via submission (+150) is the most likely outcome according to the oddsmakers. Given a decision is also in play, we'll go with Pantoja to win, rather than betting on a submission, but Pantoja could certainly find that submission somewhere over five rounds if you're feeling frisky.Merab Dvalishvili vs.\tPetr YanMerab Dvalishvili to win by KO/TKO/DQ or submission (+450)Dvalishvili is looking for his fourth bantamweight title defense of 2025, a torrid pace for any UFC champion. That's probably the biggest concern for the champion heading into a rematch of a fight he won 50-45 across the board the first time. In that first meeting, Dvalishvili shot a record 49 takedown attempts, completing 11. Despite not winning a round, Yan's ability to stuff nearly 80% of Dvalishvili's takedowns is why some are interested in the rematch. Dvalishvili is -395 to win, and he should be expected to get the victory unless a fourth weight cut in a single calendar year has him physically diminished. I have a feeling Dvalishvili will be out to prove a point against Yan. Dvalishvili wants to be the greatest bantamweight of all time and could set the record for consecutive title defenses in the division on Saturday. Look for Dvalishvili to find the finish somewhere across five rounds.Who wins UFC 323: Dvalishvili vs. Yan 2, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.\n            ",

UFC CEO Dana White announced the fight at the UFC 323 press conference on Friday.Holloway had already established a sure-fire Hall of Fame resume when he added the BMF belt to his mantle. One of the best action fighters of the era, Holloway won the featherweight championship with a TKO victory over Jose Aldo in June 2017. He made four successful defenses of the belt before dropping the title to Alexander Volkanovski.Holloway's only losses in the past decade have come against the elite of the elite, with a loss to Dustin Poirier, three losses to Volkanovski and a loss to Ilia Topuria, all in championship bouts. Holloway avenged the loss to Poirier in his most recent fight, taking a decision at UFC 318 to retain the BMF title he won with an iconic knockout of Justin Gaethje at UFC 300.Holloway is the only fighter to have successfully defended the BMF belt.EventWinnerLoserUFC 244Jorge Masvidal (vacated BMF title upon retirement)Nate DiazUFC 291Justin GaethjeDustin PoirierUFC 300Max HollowayJustin GaethjeUFC 318Max HollowayDustin PoirierOliveira is a former lightweight champion, winning the vacant title at UFC 262 after Khabib Nurmagomedov retired as champion.

It will be interesting to see how the fans will react after the former coach joined Juventus, one of their biggest rivals. Since he joined the Bianconeri in October, the Italian coach is unbeaten as Juventus won four matches and drew three in all competitions but they will now face Antonio Conte's Napoli away in one of the most anticipated clashes of the season. How to watch Napoli vs. Juventus, oddsDate: Sunday, Dec. 7 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Diego Armando Maradona -- Naples Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Napoli +133; Draw +196; Juventus +233How to watch Serie A Matchday 13All times U.S./EasternSaturday, December 6Sassuolo vs. Fiorentina, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Inter vs. Como, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Hellas Verona vs. Atalanta, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, December 7Cremonese vs. Lecce, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. AS Roma, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Lazio vs. Bologna, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Napoli vs. Juventus, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Monday, December 8Pisa vs. Parma, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Udinese vs. Genoa, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Torino vs. AC Milan, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. -- With the expansion of the World Cup to 48 teams, an increase in squads also means more restrictions on which teams could be drawn together. On the heels of a winter World Cup in 2022 in Qatar, followed by the Euros and both UEFA and Concacaf Nations Leagues taking place, the start of World Cup qualifying was pushed back, leading to the play-in games taking place during March of 2026 after the World Cup draw has already been completed.During the draw on Friday, when Uzbekistan were drawn, groups had to be skipped, causing some confusion. Putting the Asian side into Group K alongside Portugal, Colombia, and the winner of the Intercontinental Playoff 1 (DR Congo/Jamaica/New Caledonia) was necessary. That's because putting them anywhere else would've potentially complicated things, resulting in a situation where there were two teams from the same confederation, which is not permitted, outside of UEFA. Because the playoff winners are not known, avoiding the possibility of having two teams from the same confederation had to be prevented.\nThe standard restrictions were in play that impact any World Cup. However, UEFA is required to have two groups of two of its teams due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament from Europe. But looking at the draw mechanics, the playoffs containing teams from multiple different confederations meant that restrictions had to be applied more than once.For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions were applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams. That already created limited chances, but with DR Congo, Jamaica, and New Caledonia representing CAF, Concacaf, and OFC, there was almost no other group that they could go into to further limit options.\nIf playoffs took place before the World Cup draw, that wouldn't be an issue, but in an expanded World Cup, new quirks are created. It's something that may be able to be smoothed out ahead of the 2030 World Cup, but it made for a moment where people didn't know where a team was going. It will take until the March international break for the full World Cup field to be known, but the picture is becoming clearer by the day.\n            ",

Since their Week 5 bye last season, the Eagles are 20-3 over their last 23 games, including the postseason and last week's loss. Although the Eagles haven't won any of their four games this season by more than seven points, the Giants should provide their easiest matchup on paper this season after playing four games against playoff teams following a Week 1 matchup against the Cowboys with a healthy Dak Prescott. The Giants are 1-4 this season, with their four losses coming by an average of 10.8 points and dropping three of four contests by more than seven points. The Eagles defeated the Giants, 28-3, at MetLife Stadium last year behind former Giants running back Saquon Barkley's 176 rushing yards, and the model projects another dominant Philadelphia performance against New York. The model projects the Eagles to cover in 61% of simulations.</p><h3>Over 40.5 points</h3><p>You may never have guessed that the Eagles have the No. 11 scoring offense in the NFL with all the negativity seemingly surrounding the unit. Despite Jalen Hurts averaging 177.8 passing yards, Saquon Barkley averaging 53.4 rushing yards, and A.J. Brown averaging 38.8 receiving yards this season, the Eagles continue to put up points. They are averaging 25 points per game this season, while scoring at least 24 points in three of five contests. Philadelphia had back-to-back weeks with more than 30 points before its 21-17 loss to the Broncos, and now faces a Giants defense that allowed 26 points to a Spencer Rattler-led Saints team last week. New York ranks 22nd in scoring defense, allowing 25.4 ppg this season. The Eagles have scored at least 28 points in three of their last four games against the Giants, not including Week 18 when they rested their starters last season. Dart makes his third NFL start for the Giants, and he led New York to 21 points against a top-10 defense in the Chargers in his debut at MetLife Stadium. The model projects 43 points for Giants vs. Eagles.</p><h3>Responsible gaming</h3><p>Responsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>FRISCO, Texas -- Week 6 of the 2025 NFL season brings forth a referendum on the Dallas Cowboys' free agency decision-making at the running back position.</p><p>Dallas watched now-27-year-old running back Rico Dowdle become the first <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-rico-dowdle-becomes-first-undrafted-player-in-franchise-history-to-accomplish-this-feat/\" target=\"_blank\">undrafted player in team history to rush for over 1,000 yards</a></span> in 2024, and despite that, allowed him to walk in free agency to sign a one-year, $2.75 million contract with the Carolina Panthers in 2025. The Cowboys are readying to face Dowdle and the Panthers in Week 6 a week after he was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week in Week 5. He earned that hardware thanks to him producing a career-high 206 yards rushing and a touchdown on 12 carries (nine yards a carry) in Carolina's 27-24 victory over the Miami Dolphins. In most circumstances, a team letting a player like Dowdle walk for relative pennies would be feeling some type of regret. </p><p>That's not the case for the Cowboys since 25-year-old Javonte Williams, who they signed to a one-year, $3 million deal to replace Dowdle in free agency, is the NFL's third-leading rusher (447 yards) through five weeks this season. Williams himself didn't know Dowdle but heard of him with both growing up in North Carolina, and Williams seeing him on high school recruiting rankings.</p><p>\"It's hard. Rico is a really skilled runner, great vision. He runs hard. The guys who have been around him, we've got a ton of new faces, they don't realize the power that he has. Rico was a guy that we considered keeping, and we kind of fell in love with Javonte,\" Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer said Wednesday. \"Were we right? I don't know. Javonte is doing great. Rico is doing great, but the Carolina Panthers are a damn good run team, and that's not just because of Rico. It's because of their offensive line, but I'm proud of Rico.\"</p>\n<p>So why did Dallas make the choice to take the plunge on Williams despite a gnarly knee injury (a torn ACL and LCL) in 2022 that limited his efficiency? Schottenheimer and Co. fell in love with his playstyle on tape, and they projected a return to form three years removed from the injury. The love is mutual. </p><p>\"I wanted to come [here] as much as they wanted me probably, but I mean it all just worked out,\" Williams said on Thursday. \"I'm glad it did. I'm glad I came. I'm glad I got the teammates I got.\"</p><p>\"I'm the president of Javonte's fan club,\" Schottenheimer said last Friday. \"Just because of the way he plays the game. ... Javonte is a guy that doesn't need huge windows. ... Javonte has the ability to quickly one cut and find a seam, or if it's not there, he's going to get his shoulders down and push the pile for two, three, four yards. What I love about Javonte is he gets stronger as the game gets going.\"</p>\n<p>The Cowboys' gamble has paid off early on: Williams' 5.7 yards per carry is the fourth-best in the NFL, his five rushing touchdowns are tied for the second-most in the league and he leads the NFL in rushing first downs with 25. Nearly a third of Williams' carries, 31.6% (25 of 79), are going for first downs. That's the highest rate in the league among 30 players with at least 45 carries this season. </p><p>\"Yeah, I think it was number one, the physical play style certainly jumps off the film. The quickness and the one cut ability to make people miss. ... It was really cool for him to have his longest of his career [66 yards] yesterday,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"It was a hell of a run. Defensive end closed, and he was unblocked. And he has the strength to pull through that, and then the pad level. We never really compared to anybody. He's his own player. I think I've said this before, I am not surprised by how well he's playing. We saw it in training camp. Really, you go back, you look at the Denver film. There were a lot of those same type plays that were on the film. When you're sometimes coming back from an injury, it takes you a little bit longer, especially at that position.\"   </p><table><tbody><tr><th>Javonte Williams This Season, NFL Ranks</th><th><br /></th><th>NFL Rank</th></tr><tr><td><p>Carries</p></td><td><p>79</p></td><td><p>9th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rush Yards</p></td><td><p>447</p></td><td><p>3rd</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Yards Per Carry</p></td><td><p>5.7</p></td><td><p>4th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rush TD</p></td><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>T-2nd</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rushing First Downs</p></td><td><p>25</p></td><td><p>1st</p></td></tr><tr><td>First Downs per Carry</td><td>31.6%</td><td>1st*</td></tr><tr><td><p>Rush Yards After Contact</p></td><td><p>326</p></td><td><p>2nd</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tackles Avoided</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>T-9th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Scrimmage Yards</p></td><td><p>525</p></td><td><p>7th</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Scrimmage TD</p></td><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>T-2nd</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>* Among 30 players with at least 45 carries this season</em></p><p>Williams actually ran into Cowboys fill-in left tackle Nate Thomas before bouncing off of him to rip off a career-long, 66-yard run at the end of the first half against the Jets in Week 5. Dallas went up 23-3 with 19 seconds left in the first half on the very next play, a one-yard touchdown toss to tight end Jake Ferguson. </p><p>\"I didn't really recognize it at first. I was just trying to see what was going on, but if that's what it takes for him to run 70 or 80 yards, I wouldn't mind getting hit every once in a while if that means he gets there,\" Thomas said on Monday. </p><p>Thomas, a 2024 seventh-round pick who started at left tackle in place of the injured Tyler Guyton (concussion) last week, said he can hear some sort of sound effect every time Williams runs with the football, something that changes depending on the situations. </p><p>\"Oh absolutely. You definitely hear something. It just depends on what it is. Sometimes you can hear him, and he's flying right past you, it's choom. Or he hits somebody, it's the pads thumping,\" Thomas said. </p><p>Tight end Jake Ferguson described Williams' running style in one word: \"DAWG.\" Prescott elaborated a little more on Williams' calculated bulldozing. </p><p>\"He knows where the offensive line is blocking, and he knows where the soft spot is in the defense. You can just see it on times of setting up things and coming back out this way,\" quarterback Dak Prescott said on Thursday. \"Super physical but smart. It's not just a bull in a China shop. He's doing it very calculated.\" </p><p>Dallas started their final drive of the first half at New York in Week 5 on their own 33 with 35 seconds left on the clock, so Schottenheimer was calculating Williams' first down run as a test to see if he would decide to use timeouts or let the half run out with the Cowboys leading 17-3. Williams' 66-yard explosion obviously changed the head coach's calculus. </p><p>\"It's a little bit like, you can't stick your toe in the water like, 'Hey, let's see if this goes.' It was not called to go for 60-something yards. It was not called that way,\" Schottenheimer said. \"And then when Javonte started to break, it was like, 'Okay, good, this is awesome. Okay, you might not score, please get out of bounds.' And he did. It shows the IQ, the football IQ of Javonte. At that point, we were obviously very comfortable because we knew we were going to get a couple shots at the end zone. But if that run goes for a yard or two, I would be lying if I said we were going to go two-minute. But if it had gone for 10, 12, 15, we would have gone.\"</p>\n<p>Williams broke two tackles on his 66-yard eruption on Sunday, not including his friendly fire with Thomas. That's a play style that gets his offensive linemen grinning ear to ear when asked to describe it. The 25-year-old's 326 rushing yards after contact this season are the second-most in the NFL behind only Indianapolis Colts All-Pro Jonathan Taylor's 346. </p><p>\"Do y'all not see the amount of people he hits, and [he] just looks at them. Yeah, he's very violent, but he definitely gets those yards after contact a lot,\" Thomas said. </p><p>The greatest example of Williams' contact balance came on third-and-1 early in the second quarter where he appeared to get stuffed on a shotgun run up the middle. Instead of losing two or three yards, Williams kept churning until he lunged forward to move the chains for a first down. </p><p>\"That well-blocked play? That excellent play that was exactly how we drew it up. You don't block the defensive end and then a guy crosses [Jake Ferguson's] face and there's no one there. That one? Yeah, I remember that. ... That was one of my best calls of the day,\" Schottenheimer said sarcastically.   ... \"That was just an incredible, incredible effort by a fiery, doesn't say much, ultra competitive baller. That was one of the best yard-and-a-half runs I've ever seen.\"   </p>\n<p>How physical is Williams? Physical enough that Schottenheimer became comfortable enough to compare him to a couple of Pro Bowlers he's coached in other stops: Michael Turner and Thomas Jones. </p><p>\"His run style is different, so I mean, I hate comparing players. I was around Michael Turner in San Diego, he ran with that physical style. Thomas Jones was another very physical runner. Shonn Green. But, yeah, Javonte's ability to get his pads down, to strike with power and leg drive, it's unique,\" Schottenheimer said. \"But if you watch him and what he does pre-practice, getting ready for practice, post-practice, working on his leg strength and things like that, it's no surprise that he has bounced back the way that he has, and that he has been as effective as he's been.\"</p><p>Another key to Williams' effectiveness is Dallas' decision to hold him out of the 2025 preseason entirely as he ramped up to return to full strength post-ACL-and-LCL tear. </p><p>\"It goes back to the importance of practice. How we just really talked about it a ton in training camp, you get such great work against our defense. We saw what we're seeing now without the tackling part of it. We saw that every day in practice against our defense. The decisiveness, the quickness, the ability to make people miss, the ability to run through people,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday.</p><p>Williams' single-season career-high in carries is 217, something he set back in 2017, but with 79 carries through five games, he's on pace to shatter that figure with an estimated 269 carries this season. That doesn't matter in Schottenheimer's mind: Williams will remain \"the bell cow.\"  </p><p>\"We're mindful of it. I think it's a situation where you never want to put that thing into the atmosphere about what could happen, but it is a violent position. He's playing great,\" Schottenheimer said. ... \"Javonte is the bell cow, and he's earned that. We believe in him and that's the way we'll approach it moving forward.\"</p><p>That's music to Williams' ears considering he was unsure about his football future back in 2022 following his knee injury. Now, he's entrenched as the Cowboys' bell cow.</p><p>\"Nah, there was a time I thought it was going to be over with, but I just kept going,\" Williams said. \"The coaches have a lot of trust in me. I like my teammates. ... It takes time with injuries. I'm just glad I'm back healthy.\"</p>\n            </div>",

Kennesaw State is coming off a 24-16 win over Middle Tennessee behind 101 rushing yards on 12 carries (8.4 yards per rush) from sixth-year senior Coleman Bennett last week. The 6-foot, 210-pound back is averaging 4.9 yards per carry this season. Kennesaw State's three-game winning streak has all come by protecting home field, and the Owls remain at home again on Thursday. The model projects the Owls to stay competitive with Louisiana Tech on their home field in this Conference USA matchup, with the Owls covering the spread in 62% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: East Carolina Pirates vs. Tulane Green Wave, 7:30 p.m. ET</strong><br /></li><li><strong>The Pick: Under 54.5 points</strong></li></ul><p>The Under has hit in three straight Pirates games, and in four of their five contests this season. Meanwhile, the Under has also hit in back-to-back Tulane contests and in three of five games this year. None of the last three East Carolina games have even reached 50 combined points, largely due to the Pirates' stout defense. East Carolina ranks 13th in the nation in scoring defense (16 points per game), and Tulane is 67th in the nation in scoring at 26.2 ppg. The model projects the Under to hit in 69% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Southern Miss Golden Eagles vs. Georgia Southern Eagles, 8 p.m. ET</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Georgia Southern (+3)</strong></li></ul><p>Georgia Southern hosts Southern Miss on Thursday, and the Eagles are 2-0 at home this season. They've scored more than 40 points in both contests and covered the spread in both games. The Eagles rushed for more than 200 yards in each home game, led by senior running back OJ Arnold's 213 yards and three touchdowns over those two games. Southern Miss is 3-2 this season, but the Golden Eagles will play just their second game on the road. They lost to Louisiana Tech, 30-20, in their only road game this season. The model projects Georgia Southern to cover the spread in 73% of simulations.</p><ul><li><strong>Game: Jacksonville State Gamecocks vs. Sam Houston Bearkats, 8 p.m. ET</strong></li><li><strong>The Pick: Jacksonville State (-7.5)</strong></li></ul><p>It would be an understatement to say Sam Houston has struggled to keep opposing teams off the scoreboard this season, ranking 131st of 136 teams in scoring defense.

Jacksonville State is 2-3 this season, but the Gamecocks are 1-0 in Conference USA play heading into this conference matchup on CBS Sports Network. Junior Cam Cook has 614 rushing yards on 5.5 yards per carry to lead the Gamecocks, rushing for at least 75 yards in all five games and at least 120 yards in three contests.

After <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chiefs-chris-jones-addresses-trevor-lawrences-game-winning-touchdown-play-which-he-appeared-to-take-off/\" target=\"_blank\">initially placing the blame</a></span> for the touchdown on the defense as a whole, Jones on Thursday took personal accountability for not finishing the play -- one where he could have had a chance to keep Lawrence out of the end zone if he went full speed.</p><p>Lawrence tripped over an offensive lineman and hit the ground on a first-and-goal play from the Chiefs' 1-yard line, but he quickly bounced back up and ran for what proved to be the game-winning touchdown. Instead of chasing Lawrence on his scramble to the goal line, Jones walked along the line of scrimmage and watched the Jaguars quarterback make the thrilling play. It was something Jones said \"won't happen again.\"</p><p>\"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5fA7m5NxGY&t=2082s\" target=\"_blank\">It's a teaching point for me</a>,\" said Jones. \"A little adversity. I can't think the play was over. It's a learning lesson. I thought it was over. I thought we had him down, so I kind of stopped, was about to celebrate and then realized that he wasn't down. The teaching lesson for me is 'don't stop.'\"</p>\n<p>Criticism of the apparent lack of effort ran wild after the game, and fans noted that Jones' social media accounts were deactivated. Jones said, however, that he was not running from criticism and in fact had deleted the profiles two days before the game.</p>\n<p>\"I gotta finish,\" said Jones. \"I can't think or assume that he's down. I gotta finish. I'll be better.\"</p><p>The stunning loss dropped the Chiefs to a 2-3 start, their worst since 2021. They rebounded in that season to reach the AFC Championship Game, so could a similar bounce back be in store over the final three months of the 2025 season? The road ahead is difficult with playoff and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> contenders aplenty in the coming weeks, and it starts Sunday night with a showdown against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a>.</p>\n<p>\"I've been focused on the Lions since the game,\" said Jones. \"You can't hold your head on one play or one game. It's a week in, week out thing. You learn from it, you take notes, you take the good, take the bad. It's never really as good as it seems. It's never really as bad as it seems. You just take the good with the bad and you keep pushing.\"</p>\n            </div>",

That 83.3% cover rate is the best in the NFL over this span, and the Eagles are also 6-2 ATS in divisional games since 2024. Meanwhile, the Giants have covered in just two of their last eight NFC East games, and just two teams in the league have a worse cover percentage in divisional contests since the start of 2024.</p><p>Much has been made about the Eagles offensive struggles, but one shouldn't overlook that no team is protecting the ball like Philly. Its one giveaway on the season is the fewest in the NFL, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> is the only quarterback who's started every game this year that hasn't thrown an interception.

Dallas has overcome CeeDee Lamb's absence with 77 points over its last two games, both of which it covered. Dak Prescott has eight total touchdowns, versus zero turnovers, over this span and his completion percentage over 2025 is the highest of his career. He's being assisted by a dominant run game that ranks in the top 10 in both yards per game and yards per carry after ranking 27th or worse in both in 2024.</p><p>Dallas should feast off a Carolina defense which has the fewest sacks (five) in the NFL and the lowest pressure rate. Carolina isn't much better on offense, ranking 24th in scoring and 26th in passing yards. The Panthers did win last week, but Bryce Young has followed up each of his last four victories with straight-up defeats. The model has Dallas prevailing versus the spread almost 60% of the time in an A-rated pick. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-6-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week6NFLodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<p>Another one of its Week 6 NFL predictions: the Buccaneers (-3, 47.5) cover versus San Francisco in over 50% of simulations. Between their juggling of quarterbacks, just six teams have a worse turnover differential than the 49ers, who are also getting next to nothing in their run game. The team is dead last in yards per carry, and a one-dimensional offense may struggle to keep up with the Bucs. Baker Mayfield owns a 10:1 TD:INT, and Tampa ranks in the top 10 in both scoring offense and total offense.</p><p>San Fran does have a few extra days of rest after playing last Thursday, but that hasn't necessarily been an omen to spread success. The team is just 2-4 ATS with a rest advantage over its last six games, and one can't ignore the cross-country flight that the Niners will have to make. San Francisco played three games on the East Coast last season and failed to cover in all three. The model also says the Over hits well over 50% of the time. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-6-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week6NFLodds\" target=\"_blank\">See which other teams to pick here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How to make Week 6 NFL picks</h3><p>The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 6 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams that win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-odds-lines-spreads-2025-week-6-picks-predictions-from-proven-model/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_Week6NFLodds\" target=\"_blank\">You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><strong>So what Week 6 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which five teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The Philadelphia Eagles haven't won a game by more than seven points this season, but the defending Super Bowl champions are 4-1 while covering the spread in three of those four victories, playing one of the toughest schedules in the league to open the 2025 NFL season. Four of their first five games came against teams that made the playoffs last season, but their Thursday Night Football matchup certainly isn't as daunting on paper as their previous five contests. The Eagles play the Giants, who went 3-14 last year and are 1-4 this season, and the SportsLine model projects Philadelphia to have a convincing victory, making the Eagles to cover a 7-point spread one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings. Kickoff for Eagles vs. Giants is set for 8:15 p.m. ET, and the over/under for total points scored is 40.5. Giants receiver Darius Slayton is inactive with a hamstring injury.</p><p>With the latest <strong>DraftKings promo code</strong>, new users can get <strong>$200 in bonus bets </strong>if your first $5 bet wins. The model is also projecting a larger favorite to have no issues covering the number for Thursday college football bets, with Jacksonville State covering its 7-point spread against Sam Houston as another of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings. Jacksonville State won last year's Conference USA championship, and plays an 0-5 Sam Houston team on CBS Sports Network at 8 p.m. ET. That game has a robust over-under of 54.5. The model is also backing Over 7.5 runs in Phillies vs. Dodgers in 2025 MLB playoff action in its Thursday parlay at DraftKings Sportsbook.

The Eagles held the Giants to 119 yards of total offense, and this time, they face a quarterback making just his third NFL start. Jaxson Dart faces a tough challenge against the Eagles' defense after the Giants turned the ball over five times against the Saints last week. The Eagles are coming off their first loss in a 21-17 final against the Broncos last week, and despite being 20-3 over their last 23 games, including the playoffs, panic seemed to ensue around the Eagles. The model expects the Eagles to quiet any outside noise around the team in a convincing victory, with the model projecting the Eagles to cover the spread in 63% of simulations.</p><h3>Jacksonville State (-7) vs. Sam Houston (-115)</h3><p>Sam Houston ranks 131st of 136 teams in scoring defense, allowing 41.6 points per game and at least 37 points in every contest over its 0-5 start. This could be one of its toughest tests yet against the reigning Conference USA champions and Jacksonville State defeated Liberty, 34-24, in its conference opener on Sept. 6. Jacksonville State running back Cam Cook has dominated on the ground this season, rushing for 614 rushing yards on 5.5 yards per carry in five games, including three games with at least 120 rushing yards. Freshman quarterback Caden Creel added 161 rushing yards in Jacksonville State's last game on Sept. 27, and the Gamecocks should be rested and well prepared off a bye week. The model projects Jacksonville State to cover the spread in 59% of simulations.</p><h3>Phillies vs. Dodgers Over 7.5 runs (-119)</h3><p>The Dodgers and Phillies went Over this total in two of three games this series, including on Wednesday in an 8-2 Philadelphia victory in Los Angeles. Kyle Schwarber hit two home runs on Wednesday after finishing second in baseball with 56 home runs this season. Shohei Ohtani (55 home runs) finished third, and this series features many of the top offensive players in baseball, such as Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, Freddie Freeman and Mookie Betts to go along with Schwarber and Ohtani. The Dodgers are starting Tyler Glasnow, who allowed five runs in two innings in his regular-season start against the Phillies in April. The Phillies are starting Christoher Sanchez, who allowed two runs over 5 2/3 innings in Game 1 and allowed four runs in each of his two starts against the Dodgers during the regular season. The model projects the Over to hit in 60.1% of simulations. <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanatics&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Claim your $250 in Fancash here:</a></p><h2>Want more NFL, college football and MLB picks for Thursday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Thursday best bets.

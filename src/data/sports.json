Over/unders of this range have heavenly leaned towards the Under for both teams, with them going a combined 9-4 when the total is between 231 and 234. The Lakers have failed to reach the total in each of their last two games, while the Under is 5-2 over the last seven Detroit contests.Detroit has one of the league's best defenses, ranking second in defensive rating and fifth in points allowed per game. The Pistons lead the NBA in blocks and rank third in steals, which will make a Lakers team missing two starters in Reaves and Hachimura -- who combine for nearly 40 ppg -- struggle to put points on the scoreboard. Add in that both teams rank among the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage and made 3-pointers per game, and there should be lots of rebounds to grab on both ends. The Under is projected to hit 56% of the time.It has also generated an against-the-spread pick that hits in more than 50% of simulations. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. So who wins Lakers vs. Pistons, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Pistons vs. Lakers spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

After an almost two-week dead period, the College Football Playoff is set to return Wednesday with the quarterfinal round of games. On paper, this is one of the most thrilling playoff slates we have seen yet. It all starts Wednesday evening as No. 2 Ohio State starts its national title defense in the Cotton Bowl against No. 10 Miami. While the Buckeyes are making their 2025 playoff debut, Miami has some momentum after a first-round upset of No. 7 Texas A&M. The action on New Year's Eve sets the table for a busy New Year's Day. No. 4 Texas Tech and No. 5 Oregon kick things off at noon in the Orange Bowl, which represents the Red Raiders' playoff debut. No. 1 Indiana starts its journey at 4 p.m. ET in the Rose Bowl. The Hoosiers will have to get past a resurgent No. 9 Alabama, which won its first playoff game under Kalen DeBoer in dominant fashion when it went on the road and trounced No. 8 Oklahoma. Then, the Sugar Bowl plays host to an SEC rematch in the nightcap. No. 3 Georgia and No. 6 Ole Miss have become familiar foes in recent years; this will be the fourth time they've played each other since 2023 and the second time this season. Georgia rallied from a 35-26 fourth-quarter deficit on Oct. 18 to secure a 43-35 victory against the Rebels. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternQuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl (2) Ohio State vs. (10) Miami -- : 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5) Oregon -- : Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl (1) Indiana vs. (9) Alabama -- : 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (3) Georgia vs. (6) Ole Miss --:  8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9Peach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. First roundFriday, Dec. 19\n(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Cowboys announced Tuesday that they are releasing cornerback Trevon Diggs. The veteran defensive back is subject to waivers. If he passes through waivers, he will be free to sign with any team. Any club that claims Diggs becomes responsible for the $472,000 he is due in base salary for Week 18, and $58,823 if he is active this week, per ESPN. Diggs signed a five-year, $97 million extension with Dallas prior to the 2023 season, in which he tore his ACL. While he is technically signed through 2028, there is no more guaranteed money remaining on his deal after this year.Diggs' release was \"a cumulation of multiple factors both on and off the field,\" CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported. Clarence Hill Jr. of the DLLS Sports reported that Diggs requested to stay in the Washington, D.C. area after the Cowboys' Week 17 game against the Washington Commanders. The team denied the request, but Diggs, who is from the area, stayed back anyway.\"It is extremely unusual for teams to allow someone to not travel back when a hardship isn't involved,\" Jones noted.\nDiggs played in the first six games of the season before an accident in his home landed him in concussion protocol. Dallas placed him on injured reserve after re-aggravating a knee injury, but he returned to the lineup in Week 16. In eight games played this season, Diggs recorded 25 tackles with zero pass defensed and zero interceptions. It appeared Diggs and the Cowboys were headed for divorce earlier this month when the two sides disagreed over whether the cornerback should be activated off injured reserve or not. Diggs said he was healthy enough to play vs. the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15, but was not allowed to do so. \"Going into the week, that was the plan, for me to play. I was included in the game plan to play, and [Saturday] I was told I wasn't playing, so that's why I thought I was playing,\" Diggs said, via CBS Sports' Garrett Podell. \"It was a quick decision. I thought I was going to come out here and play, but they felt otherwise. That's just what it was.\"\nWhile Diggs said he felt good enough to play, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer plus team owner and general manager Jerry Jones felt differently. \"Diggs isn't healthy enough to be out there for us. Period,\" Jones said following the loss to the Vikings. \"You have to look at practices and if they practice good enough. Whether it's a limitation they've had in recent games or a long-term injury, you've got to make your mind up when you see him practice. When we looked at practice, we didn't like what we saw relative to his health and ability to make plays.\"Ultimately, Diggs was activated for the Week 16 matchup against the Los Angeles Chargers, and then played 100% of the defensive snaps during the Christmas victory over the Washington Commanders. However, Diggs is now being allowed a change of scenery.\nDiggs is a two-time Pro Bowl player, and named a First Team All-Pro in 2021 when he led the league in interceptions with 11. In 66 career games played, the brother of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs recorded 240 tackles, 63 passes defensed and 20 interceptions. \n            ",

Both teams have overwhelmingly favored the Under this season, as it is 9-4 for Carolina and 8-5 for Florida State. The Tar Heels have failed to reach the total in six of their last seven games, while the recent matchup history has also been taken into account. The team's last five meetings have seen under 160 points scored in four of them as they've averaged 155.4 combined points.As the heavy favorites, UNC is expected to dictate the style of play, and the Heels are a defense-first team this season. They rank 16th, nationally, in points allowed per game but sit outside the top 100 in points scored per game. As for FSU, it leads the ACC with 9.8 steals per game, so many of its defensive possessions don't even end with a shot attempt by the opponent. With these factors, the Under hits well over 60% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins UNC vs. FSU, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

USC went 9-3 and was in the CFP mix until a loss to Oregon on Nov. 22 ended any realistic chances. TCU went 8-4 and ended the regular season on a two-game winning streak. USC quarterback Jayden Maiava is playing, but he won't have his top three targets as receivers Ja'Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon and tight end Lake McRee have all opted out. TCU's most notable absence is quarterback Josh Hoover, who is heading to the transfer portal.Kickoff from the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas is at 9 p.m. ET.

The total has dropped since opening at 58.5, with absences such as Hoover and Lemon factoring into that. USC, however, should still be able to move that ball with Maiava leading the charge. Freshman receiver Tanook Hines should be able to step up and be a top target, while USC's run game remains in good shape with King Miller leading that way. The Horned Frogs have a capable backup quarterback in Ken Seals who can step in. Seals didn't play much this year, but has over 700 career passing attempts dating back to his time at Vanderbilt from 2020-23. TCU receiver Eric McAlister, an NFL prospect, has decided to play, giving TCU another spark on offense.

    "body": "\n        Without some of their best players as Declan Rice missed out with a knee injury, Arsenal were able to go five points clear atop the Premier League after defeating Aston Villa 4-1 at the Emirates Stadium with a four-minute double from Gabriel and Martin Zubimendi. Entering the match, Villa were the hottest team in the Premier League with eight consecutive league wins, including taking down Arsenal at Villa Park, but in the reverse fixture, Arsenal made a statement that they're the contenders to beat. Ollie Watkins would get a goal late on for Villa, but Arsenal's four goals in the second half blew the match wide open and quickly.Villa had their chances in the first half of the match, but as Arsenal grew into the clash, it became clear which team was controlling the match. After the goal in the 48th minute, Arsenal kept their feet on the gas, including an all-important goal for Gabriel Jesus. The Arsenal forward scored as soon as he entered the match, which is a statement to Arsenal's growing depth as they get healthy during the season. He's been working his way back to full fitness after suffering an ACL tear in January, and entering 2026 with Jesus in the squad will only increase the options that Arteta has at his disposal.Kai Havertz also made his return to the squad, although the German attacker didn't make it into this match, he's another player who will be key down the stretch for Arsenal as they look to capture their first Premier League title since 2003-04. Now having won four consecutive matches in the league, the Gunners are looking stay hot with contenders lurking. Manchester City can draw within two points of the Gunners when they face Sunderland on Thursday, but anticipation will grow for their clash with Arsenal on April 18, which could decide the league title if they continue at their current pace. City are linked to adding Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth who could provide Pep Guardiola with more options in the attack but Arteta has shown that after the Gunners added Viktor Gyokeres, Martin Zubimendi, Noni Madueke, Eberechi Eze, and Piero Hincapie during he summer, their squad is deep enough to keep up with anyone in the league.\nFor Villa, despite this setback, they're in a great place entering the new year under Unai Emery, with a nine-point lead over Chelsea for a top-four place. Getting back into the Champions League is the goal for Villa, and even with losing, they aren't fully out of the title race in the Premier League due to trailing by six points, but this does throw a wrench in any title ambitions that they would've had.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The New Orleans Saints appear to have their quarterback of the future in Tyler Shough, who is 5-3 since entering the starting lineup and rides a four-game winning streak into the regular-season finale. As it turns out, their last franchise quarterback played a key role in developing their next one. Shough said that his conversations with Drew Brees earlier this season helped him hit the ground running as a starter.Shough, the No. 40 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, took just three snaps in the first seven weeks of the season but spent those first two months of his career gearing up for an opportunity to lead the offense. When he spoke with Brees, the future Hall of Famer assured him that he was on the right track.\"Being able to talk to Drew Brees midway through the season and get a really in-depth look at what his week looked like and his preparation,\" Shough said. \"And then also just trusting the plan that your coaches have out for you. When I got to talk to Drew and kind of compare and contrast to what I had been doing, it was really encouraging because I had been doing most all those things and I could implement some of the things that he was doing from a preparation standpoint.\"The Saints won at least 11 games in each of Brees' final four years in New Orleans. They have a sub-.500 record over the five years since his retirement, but the late-season surge with Shough under center suggests they could eventually return to the level of success they enjoyed during Brees' legendary career.\nThat newfound optimism is quite the shift for a franchise that appeared rudderless just a couple of months ago. The Saints stood at 1-7 before they inserted Shough into the lineup.\"I just really wanted to make sure whenever I was a backup that I wanted to overprepare and make sure that when I got my opportunity that it wasn't all of the sudden 'I'm starting now. I feel like I have to do so much more,'\" Shough said.\nWhile his five interceptions are the sign of a modest learning curve, Shough has largely acclimated to the NFL in short order. The former Louisville quarterback, who also made stops at Texas Tech and Oregon throughout a lengthy college career, ranks seventh among NFL quarterbacks in completion rate at 67.8%. He also passed for more than 300 yards in each of his last two games and has made an impact on the ground with 152 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- In the afterglow of this exceptional triumph, it is perhaps worth reflecting on how implausible such a result might have seemed a quarter hour through. Given that so many of Arsenal's recent wins by one-goal margins have been batterings in disguise, perhaps it is appropriate that obliterating a paper tiger of a title contender should see the Gunners dodge a rather nasty paper cut.It is not so much that Aston Villa were necessarily better than Arsenal in the Gunners' 4-1 win on Tuesday. Their win wasn't inevitable. It certainly seemed, however, that Unai Emery had Mikel Arteta's number. Villa would absorb the strength of the first press, find a way of drawing Arsenal out of position and spring their transition threats.Ollie Watkins continued to torment his boyhood club, his ability to spin out of duels making for a forward who can get as much joy against William Saliba as anyone else. As they had three and a half weeks ago, Villa found ways to get Watkins quick ball in behind and he found ways to get shots away. Before the weirdness of garbage time, Arsenal had only allowed one shot worth over 0.5 xG in a Premier League game this season. That had gone to Watkins at Villa Park and he followed that up with an almost as frustrating miss early on, contriving to skew wide after brilliant work to get him into a scoring position.The muscularity with which Ezri Konsa stripped possession from Viktor Gyokeres and the precision of the pass that followed exemplified the excellence of Villa's start. Emery knew which duels his team were going to dominate and this game had a way of funnelling itself into the positions ,that would allow them to impose themselves. There are few players even in the Premier League who Mikel Merino bounces off. In the first half he could get no purchase on Amadou Onana, the press beater in chief. He was at his dynamic best and Arsenal were without the one player who might have been able to stop him, Declan Rice sidelined with a minor knee injury. Even if Rice had been blown by, he would have had the recovery pace to win the second duel. When Merino was taken out of a move, he was not coming back.\nPerhaps if Onana had been able to make it back out for the second half, this game would have been different. \"Maybe it didn't help us that Onana is injured,\" said Emery. \"He is important for us in set pieces and in the middle.\" That loss of fizz through the middle, already lessened due to the suspension of Boubacar Kamara, hit hard. Before Onana's exit there was a very real risk that the verticality of Villa's passing would rip through the Arsenal backline. \nThe hosts found themselves in an almighty bind. They are a very good pressing team and it is the right thing for very good pressing teams to push for those high regains. That much would be apparent in the second half, but in the first, the margins were razor-thin.  Gabriel chased Morgan Rogers right into the heart of the Villa area. He was inches away from a steal that would surely have led to Martin Odegaard's opener. Instead, he couldn't quite nick the ball, and in a flash, Onana was driving up the field. Had he not sold himself short with a blatant dive, he might have been able to create an even better chance for Villa than the ones they spurned.Arteta knew the danger his team were in. \"The moment you allow them to attack your back is a big problem because they have runners from inside, they have people that can pick up passes from deep positions, they have players in the last line that are excellent at making the runs, pulling shoulders and attacking your backs. And you have to control that because every time you give the ball away, they have the capacity to do that,\" he said. With 45 minutes played, it rather felt like Arsenal were playing with fire. In the second, they strode purposefully onto the coals. There were adjustments to the press, what Arteta termed some \"behaviors\" changing. There was no consideration given, however, to what might have seemed the most natural response of any coach in that position. No dialling down. No stepping back. Arsenal would chase the ball with even more intensity, commit even more in pursuit of the regains. \n\"I really like that,\" said Arteta, \"because you're going to go through different patches and periods against top opposition like Villa and then you still have the ability to come out on the game and deserve to win it.\"The opener might not have come from Arsenal's chasing -- set piece again, set piece again as they say 'round these parts -- but the killer second was a vindication of their aggression. Youri Tielemans might have thought he had broken through the lines but slamming into Jadon Sancho like a toddler in a bumper car came Odegaard, who recovered possession more frequently than anyone on the pitch tonight. Dancing feet took him away from John McGinn and suddenly those gaps up the gut that Villa had been exploiting were opening up for them. Martin Zubimendi cruised through.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            All that was needed from then on was to restore some xG balance to the world. For most of December, Arsenal couldn't hit a barn door from six yards out. Of course, the month ended with Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Jesus bending them in from the edge of the area. Scoring returns from range that even Steph Curry couldn't keep up propelled Villa on a title tilt, they ended this game scoring one of the three <0.8 xG shots they took.\nEven with those unmissable chances Villa found a way to spurn, they still somehow ended up outperformed on the xG front. Rarely does a statistic so compellingly speak to the difference between two teams. Even when Arsenal indulged their madness, they couldn't make themselves the inferior team. Even when their plan seemed so ill-suited to their opponents, they were simply able to do it better and prove themselves to be greatly superior.\n            ",

Referee Dan Miragliotta leaped in to stop the fight at 4:56 of Round 1 as Costa likely secured a top-15 ranking at 145 pounds. \"I told everybody this week, I just fought a legend,\" Costa said. \"No one has been able to finish him and I said that I was going to do that. I was able to do it.\"After Ige scored an early takedown, Costa quickly scrambled back to his feet and began to wear Ige down in the clinch with knees to the body. From there, Costa showcased his full offensive bag by stunning Ige with a front kick to the face and going to the body with a variety of strikes that led up to the finish.\nCosta extended his win streak that began following a second-round knockout loss to Steve Garcia in 2023. Of his six wins on his current run, four have come by stoppage. After the fight, Costa called out a former two-time featherweight title challenger who was sitting Octagonside. \"There is a guy here that you all love and I love, too,\" Costa said. \"Diego Lopes, let's go at it.\"\nIge, a 34-year-old native of Hawaii, suffered his fifth loss in his last seven fights. \n            \n",

The victory was his third straight, all by knockout, as the 32-year-old native of Serbia brought the Toyota Center crowd to its feet. \"Houston, we have a problem and it's me! I am the problem,\" Medic said. \"This division is in trouble. They need some of this, they need it, and I'm here to deliver. I'm going to knock everybody out and bulldoze through this division.\"Neal (16-8), a 35-year-old native of Texas, countered an early body kick to land a short left cross. Medic answered with some slick boxing of his own before the two heavy punchers landed right hands simultaneously in the center of the Octagon.\nMedic began to quickly open up and walk Neal down. He missed a pair of short hooks while switching stances before connecting on a perfect left hand to end the fight as Neal's head hit hard on the canvas forcing referee Kerry Hatley to instantly waive off the fight. \n\"I knock everybody out, everyone,\" Medic said. \"Sure, I lose sometimes but I'm just a human being. I may lose again but you bet your ass I'm going to come back and f---ing knock people out again.\"I knew [Neal] was going to want to box with me. Not a lot of guys want to box with me. I am an MMA fighter but boxing is something I love to do. I'm sorry this had to happen in front of his home crowd but this is the sport we are in. It's hard to watch. I have been on the wrong end of that but you get up and you keep f---ing going because life can hit 100 times harder than any man can.\"Neal lost for the fourth time in five fights and suffered his second straight knockout defeat. After the fight, Medic called out former welterweight champion Leon Edwards.\n\"Let's get this work in,\" Medic said. \"I'll be knocking everyone out.\"\n            ",

He would go on to drop the title in his next fight, a split decision loss to Dricus du Plessis at UFC 297.

He has since rattled off eight wins in a row to climb to the No. 4 spot in the official UFC middleweight rankings, one spot behind Strickland.\nUFC Fight Night also features two perennial contenders looking to protect their places in the pecking order. Geoff Neal (No. 12) battles the tenacious Uros Medic, and Dan Ige (No. 14) tries to snap Melquizael Costa's five-fight win streak. Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. Elsewhere on the undercard, ranked heavyweights are set to collide when Ante Delija and Serghei Spivac face off. Delija is looking to bounce back from a surprising knockout loss to rising contender Waldo Cortes Acosta in November. Prior to that, Delija scored two first-round knockouts in his first two UFC appearances. And an interesting UFC debut is set at welterweight when Josiah Harrell takes on Jacobe Smith. Harrell was scheduled to make his promotional debut at UFC 290 against Jack Della Maddalena, but during his fight week medical screening, doctors discovered he had Moyamoya, a rare brain disease that causes the arteries supplying blood to the brain to become narrowed or blocked. Now, nearly three years later, he gets his chance to make a first impression.Below is all the information you need to catch the action on Saturday night.

    "body": "\n        A middleweight title shot could be at stake for the winner of Saturday's UFC Fight Night main event in Houston. Former UFC champion Sean Strickland looks to bounce back against red-hot contender Anthony Hernandez.Strickland (29-7) has a new path to the middleweight title after Khamzat Chiamev became champion. Strickland was unlikely to get a third crack at Dricus du Plessis after two failed attempts. But Chimaev vs. Strickland is a fresh matchup. Between Strickland's No. 3 middleweight ranking and name value, it's feasible he could sneak ahead of the more deserving title challenger Nassourdine Imavov. Strickland has to beat Hernandez before those conversations can start. Oddsmakers think that's a tall task; Strickland disagrees.\"He has been steamrolling guys that I could f---ing write a clinic on,\"  Strickland told CBS Sports' Brian Campbell before the fight. \"So, no, he's not [on my level].\"Sign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Strickland vs. Hernandez for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nHernandez (15-2, 1 NC) is ready for his breakout moment after taking the long road through the division. \"Fluffy\" was won eight consecutive fights with six finishes. He's days away from potentially having the third longest middleweight win streak in UFC history. Beating Strickland would be the biggest accomplishment of his career, and puts him on par with Imavov as the most deserving middleweight title challenger. In fact, \"Fluffy\" would arguably have a better case than Imavov, boasting a longer win streak and just as many wins over former UFC champs.\"I think if you beat a former champ, that really makes a statement  because everybody is really good here,\" Hernandez said. \"Someone who has already done that  shit, you go out there and take him out?

Both veterans approach fight night renewed after overcoming personal health issues. For Neal, a five-year battle with substance abuse. For Ige, eye injuries before the Patricio Pitbull fight. \"I didn't have the energy for anything. I didn't prepare right. The weight cuts were terrible,\" Neal told CBS sports this week. \"There was a point before all that shit happen, I'd run for an hour at a seven mile pace. I'm knocking out eight point six miles in an hour. I'm trying to get back to the old me.\"\"I had trauma to my eyes,\" Ige said. \"My mindset going into that fight was, 'I don't know if I'll ever fight again.' I didn't know what I was dealing with. I didn't want a way out of the fight. I knew if I went to a doctor, they would tell me not to fight. That's my ego and my pride. I've battled with that for a long time. I probably should've addressed it, but I didn't... It's something I've always battled, but I'm getting better with it. I have a better relationship with myself and my thoughts. Things are night and day different.\" \nElsewhere on the undercard, ranked heavyweights are set to collide when Ante Delija and Serghei Spivac face off.

Now, nearly three years later, he gets his chance to make a first impression.\"I knew I could get back into fighting,\" Harrell told UFC.com. \"Everyone will have their insecurities as they're going on and have this dream of theirs stopped, so it was just making sure that I didn't take this away from me. I know a lot of times it's me who ends up quitting when things get hard. And no matter what excuses I would use, I needed to make sure I didn't do that, so I was focused on staying on the path, giving all glory to God, and continuing on my way and making sure I wasn't the one taking this one away from me.\"Let's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nUFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassAnthony Hernandez -278Sean Strickland +225MiddleweightGeoff Neal -218Uros Medic +180WelterweightMelquizael Costa -218Dan Ige +180FeatherweightAnte Delija -142Sergehi Spivac +120HeavyweightJacobe Smith -310Josiah Harrell +250WelterweightMichel Pereira -155Zach Reese +130MiddleweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Feb. 21 | Start time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Toyota Center -- HoustonStream: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionSean Strickland vs. Anthony Hernandez: I'm surprised with how far apart the odds are. Hernandez is taking a meaningful step up in competition against arguably the division's most frustrating defensive fighter. Strickland has elite experience and is uniquely equipped to limit his opponent's offense. Hernandez also has serious gaps in his defensive striking that Strickland can exploit. That being said, I'll side with the rising tide. Hernandez is a menace when he has grappling control and half guard on the ground. Strickland did a fantastic job stuffing du Plessis' takedowns and getting off the mat quickly. \"Fluffy\" lacks DDP's physicality, but makes up for it with tenacious chain wrestling and far better top control. Hernandez will have a tough time taking Strickland down. When he does, he'll make the most of it.

    "body": "\n        Ryan Garcia has the chance to become world champion for the first time in his career on Saturday. Garcia will face WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in a high-stakes showdown from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.Garcia is one of boxing's top stars, though various missteps have set his career back at multiple times. After starting his career 23-0, Garcia was dominated by Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis before Davis scored a seventh-round knockout with a body shot. Two fights later, Garcia put on a career-best performance, knocking down WBC junior welterweight champion Devin Haney multiple times en route to a majority decision victory. Unfortunately, Garcia missed weight for the bout, seemingly not even attempting to make the junior welterweight limit after months of apparent struggles with a mental illness episode playing out on social media. Compounding those issues, Garcia failed his drug test for the fight and the result was overturned to a no-contest.Garcia followed up his suspension from the failed drug test with a listless performance against Rolando Romero, dropping the fight by a clear unanimous decision.\n        \n            \n                Ryan Garcia looks to bounce back from uninspired loss when he faces Mario Barrios: 'Do or die moment'\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBarrios has also been uneven in his performances in recent years. He was competitive with Davis in their 2021 fight before suffering a knockout in Round 11. That fight was followed by a loss to Keith Thurman. After rattling off a three-fight winning streak that saw him capture the WBC interim welterweight title, Barrios was promoted to full champion, where he has successfully defended his title against Abel Ramos and Manny Pacquiao, though both defenses ended in draws.\nThe undercard on Saturday features plenty of intriguing players in the 140-pound division. WBA junior welterweight king Gary Antuanne Russell gets a tough test from Andy Hiraoka in a featured bout. And former title challenger Frank Martin is in action when he faces Nahir Albright with both men looking to get back to the title level.Check out how you can watch the action on Saturday night below, but be sure to check out our staff predictions and expert picks for the main event as well.Where to watch Barrios vs. GarciaDate: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Location: T-Mobile Arena -- Las VegasStart time: 5:45 p.m. ETWhere to watch: DAZN PPV | Price: $69.99Barrios vs. Garcia fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook\nRyan Garcia -250 vs. Mario Barrios (c) +195, WBC welterweight titleGary Antuanne Russell -350 vs. Andy Hiraoka +260, WBA junior welterweight titleFrank Martin -390 vs. Nahir Albright +290, junior welterweightsWho wins Mario Barrios vs. Ryan Garcia on Saturday, and which pick should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Saturday welterweight title bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As another season of MLS kicks off, Inter Miami are officially the team to beat after lifting the MLS Cup trophy in December, while Lionel Messi collected his second consecutive MVP award following a season where he was involved in a whopping 48 goals, the second-highest total in league history. As far as Messi has gone, Miami has gone with him, but as the team evolves past just being Messi and friends, with the retirement of Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, the club enters a new era.This season, Miami Freedom Park will open with the Herons moving into the city of Miami proper instead of playing their matches in Fort Lauderdale, and with it, a new MLS dynasty may be forming. Unlike baseball, where the Los Angeles Dodgers can spend to their hearts' content, MLS is a salary cap league that limits what Miami can do ... sort of.How to watch Los Angeles FC vs. Inter Miami, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 21 | Time: 9:30 p.m. ETLocation: United Airlines Field at the LA Memorial Coliseum -- Los Angeles, CaliforniaLive stream: Apple TVOdds: LAFC +101; Draw +270; Inter Miami +240With General Allocation Money, which is used to buy down players' salaries to fit under the cap, it gives Miami flexibility to make moves that others can't, and they use it to the best of their abilities. When the most recent list of allocation money by team was published in January, only three teams had more to work with than Miami's $6,484,336. And this is before taking into account having the best recruiting tool in the world in Messi.\nEveryone wants to play with the Argentine, and whether the Herons are bringing in younger players or taking a look at experienced players to elevate the team, they're hitting their transfers. Just look at their additions this offseason. Sergio Reguillon may be a gamble at left back, but German Berterame and Dayne St. Clair are clear upgrades at positions of need to make a team that just won the title better. And by winning and receiving an invitation to the Club World Cup, the Herons have just found themselves with more money to spend.It's only fitting that they open their season facing Denis Bouanga, Son Heung-min, and LAFC, another team who are able to use Club World Cup participation to their advantage. FIFA's expansion of the tournament has been a game-changer for teams in the league due to the tournament having a billion dollars on the line for all teams involved. Just for participating, each team were able to expand their coffers of allocation money, while transfers such as Diego Gomez to Brighton only add to it.\nThat mix is part of the reason why the Herons are able to do things that other teams can't, but for MLS to not become a league of the haves versus the have-nots, more teams need to push them. LAFC and Vancouver are teams who are doing that, and the level of designated players around the league has risen, but in the face of the World Cup in America in 2026, this is a chance to MLS to take its recruitment to the next level. Some of that will require loosening of roster rules, but as they have allowed for more to be spent on young players in recent years, that's something that can happen. Miami pushing the envelope is a good thing, just more teams have to join in doing so. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There will be superstars all over the ice on Sunday morning when the United States and Canada face off in the gold medal game at the Winter Olympics. Which of these two rivals has more firepower? The answer to that question may be what determines the winner.The Canadians probably have more marquee names than the Americans. Connor McDavid and Nathan MacKinnon have four Hart Trophy wins between them, and they're probably the two best hockey players in the world. That's a nice luxury for Canada, but it's not like the U.S. is lacking for star power at the top of its lineup.We've already seen what Quinn Hughes can do in big moments with his overtime goal against Sweden, and reigning Hart Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck is capable of winning a game on his own between the pipes. That's without even mentioning the one-two punch of two-way centers the Americans have in their top six forward group.\n        \n            \n                Where to watch Team USA vs. Canada: Prediction, start time for men's hockey gold medal game between rivals\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Canada holds the edge when it comes to the elite of the elite, the U.S. has the depth to take down a country that has won nine Olympic gold medals in its history. Here are the 10 best players in Sunday's gold medal game (8:10 a.m. ET).\n10. Zach Werenski | D | USAThe U.S. defensive group is deepest and most talented in the tournament, and while Quinn Hughes gets a lot of justified attention, Zach Werenski is right there with him as one of the best defenders in the world. Since the start of the 2024-25 season, Werenski has tallied 144 points, behind only Cale Makar among defensemen.Werenski also boasts a plus-34 five-on-five goal differential in that span, per Natural Stat Trick. At the 2026 Olympics, we've seen the best parts of Werenski's game, from clean zone exits to the frequent creation of dangerous scoring chances.9. Mitch Marner | LW | CanadaMarner is the rare playmaking winger who is capable of driving play on his own, and he can play in all situations. In this tournament, we've already gotten a clear picture of what Marner can do with the puck on his stick. In the Canadians' overtime win over Czechia in the quarterfinals, Marner pulled off an incredible individual effort to score the game-winner.\nA 2023 Selke Trophy finalist, Marner is also a force in the defensive end. His line with Mark Stone on the other wing could create problems for the American offense.8. Macklin Celebrini | LW | CanadaSome may think this ranking is a little high and a little premature, but Celebrini has just been that good, both in these Olympics and his young NHL career. Celebrini has completely revived a rebuilding San Jose Sharks franchise, and he's in the Hart Trophy conversation with 81 points, more than double his next closest teammate.In Milan, Canadian coach Jon Cooper put Celebrini next to McDavid, and that bold move has paid off in spades. Celebrini leads the Olympics with five goals, and he's second to McDavid in points with 10.\n7. Auston Matthews | C | USAMatthews is one of the best goal-scorers in hockey. His 427 goals since his rookie campaign in 2016-17 are the most in the league with the next closest player sitting 20 goals behind him. Matthews has a deceptive and powerful release that helps him beat goalies with ease, but he's not a one-trick pony. Matthews' defensive game has earned him Selke Trophy votes in each of the last six seasons.When Matthews is on the ice, the Americans are capable of scoring from anywhere in the offensive zone.6. Jack Eichel | C | USAOne of the best two-way centers in the NHL, Eichel has been making plays all over the ice for the U.S. through its first five games. Eichel can excel in every situation, and he's currently on pace for a 111-point season with the Vegas Golden Knights. Coach Mike Sullivan has leaned on Eichel a lot at these Olympics, and that won't stop now.\nI'd expect Eichel to be matched up against Connor McDavid whenever possible, and while that is a big challenge for any player, the American center is capable of holding his own.5. Connor Hellebuyck | G | USAHellebuyck has a strong argument to be the best goalie in the league. He's a three-time Vezina Trophy winner and the reigning NHL MVP. When Hellebuyck is on his game, there's little that an opponent can do. Hellebuyck is 6-foot-4 and rarely out of position, making him incredibly tough to beat, and he has been great for the Americans in Milan.Over the last three seasons, Hellebuyck has saved 77.5 goals above average, per Natural Stat Trick. The next closest goalie is Andrei Vasilevskiy at 52.2. Canada's Jordan Binnington is below water at -6.54.\n4. Quinn Hughes | D | USAWhat Quinn Hughes brings to this U.S. team was evident in that dramatic win over Sweden in the quarterfinals. Despite playing big minutes, Hughes was a workhorse in overtime, right up until he ended the game by firing a laser beam past Jacob Markstrom. Hughes is one of the best skaters in the world, and he's able to pair that with his high hockey IQ.The U.S. can deploy Hughes in any situation, and I have a hunch Canada will see a lot of him on Sunday morning. Hughes is one of a few defensemen who can skate with Canada's biggest stars and not look overmatched.3. Cale Makar | D | CanadaA two-time Norris Trophy winner (who is gunning to make it three in 2026), Makar is a dynamic player who impacts games in a similar fashion as Hughes. Makar is special, especially with the puck on his stick, as he uses his skating, stickhandling and vision to make plays that few players can.\nSince his rookie campaign in 2019-20, Makar leads all defensemen with 485 points, which also ranks 16th among all skaters. Makar is a threat to make a big play from anywhere on the ice -- from a stretch pass springing a teammate to wheeling around the offensive zone.2. Nathan MacKinnon | C | CanadaIt's unfair that, in addition to Connor McDavid, the Canadians also have MacKinnon at their disposal. He would be the best player on any other team in these Olympics, and he is playing at a Hart Trophy level for the Avalanche in 2025-26. MacKinnon leads the NHL with 40 goals, and he has seven points in this tournament.MacKinnon is a versatile player who can win with speed, power or some combination of both. However you want to play, he's more than happy to beat you.\n1. Connor McDavid | C | CanadaMcDavid is the best player in the world, and as if he needed to prove that fact, he leads the tournament in assists (11) and points (13). Since his rookie season in 2015-26, McDavid leads the NHL in assists (783) and points (1,178), and he ranks fifth in goals (395). He's also a three-time Hart Trophy winner, a Conn Smythe Trophy winner, a five-time Art Ross Trophy winner and Maurice Richard Trophy winner.One of the few things missing from McDavid's trophy case is a gold medal, and he seems determined to get one of those in Milan. Slowing him down will be a tall task, even for the Americans' elite defense.So who wins the 2026 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey final between USA and Canada, and what are the best bets for this matchup? Visit SportsLine now to see the 2026 Winter Olympics men's ice hockey picks and best bets from a hockey insider, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAWRENCE, Kansas — Lost in the sauce of the never-ending Darryn Peterson discourse hides the fact that it's late February, and Kansas still doesn't know quite what makes it tick yet.Bill Self likes this team, but he sure wasn't tickled pink by how his group handled Saturday's test. Unranked Cincinnati waltzed into Allen Fieldhouse and drubbed No. 8 Kansas 84-68 handing the Jayhawks its first double-digit home loss to an unranked opponent since 1993, per CBS Sports research. \"We played soft,\" Self said matter-of-factly.Peterson's spotty availability status has become the story. It's often been distilled down to an argument like this: When Peterson plays, Kansas is  a national championship contender, but…Well, Peterson played a full allotment of 32 minutes against Cincinnati, the most minutes in two weeks, and yet, Kansas' home fans were dipping for the exits long before Saturday's final buzzer sounded.\nThere's been a fog (or Phog?) clouding the reality that Kansas is still in tinkering mode, while numerous other national championship hopefuls have cleared those hurdles and have elevated into a new zip code with March looming.Meanwhile, Kansas' hot-spots emerged for the world to see.KU big man Flory Bidunga has been one of the fiercest defensive players this season, but Cincinnati found real cracks in the armor on the edges of this Kansas defense. Cincinnati forward Baba Miller scored eight of his 12 first-half points when Bidunga was not guarding him. Big man Moustapha Thiam gave redshirt freshman Bryson Tiller the work early and often on the way to a 28-point, eight-rebound showing on his 20th birthday.\n\"That's one heck of a birthday present,\" Cincinnati coach Wes Miller said. \"We all got to feel like it was our birthday tonight. I mean, I didn't know he had 28. I knew he was playing great, but I thought he was terrific.\"\nThe other side of the aisle was not feeling like having a slice of birthday cake.\"I didn't think our bigs played very big today,\" Self said.That's a grave indictment for a national championship hopeful because teams like Michigan and Florida are driven by their enormous front-lines. Bidunga is generously listed at 6-foot-10 and 235 pounds. Tiller is 6-foot-11 but doesn't always play like it. A depth option like 7-footer Paul Mbiya is not part of this rotation right now. Is Kansas big enough to win this thing in the supersized era that is college basketball? On Saturday, it sure wasn't. Cincinnati ripped down 14 offensive rebounds, much to Self's chagrin.Kansas' offense was also entirely rudderless for long stretches. The Jayhawks managed just 1.04 points per possession and managed just two assists over a 15-minute span in a second half gone awry. Peterson scored 17 of the most invisible points. Melvin Council, long the emotional leader of this group, went 3-for-13 from the field. Outside of some empty-side pick-and-rolls for Bidunga to go Turbo Smash on the rim, Kansas' offense found no easy answers against a Cincinnati group that is a top-10 defense.\n\"It's terrible, we didn't play well,\" Self said. \"Against good teams, you're not going to score fast. You're not going to score on the first side (of the floor). We don't have that type of team, and we didn't screen, and we didn't do a lot of things the way that I would hope that we would do it. I got to do a better job of getting us to do. We've shown that we can do it at times, but we certainly didn't do it against a team that demands it being done because they're so sound.\"There isn't any time to lick wounds. No. 2 Houston will saunter into Lawrence on Monday, and the Cougars can steal some of Cincinnati's homework.Houston could out-rebound the Jayhawks by 21, not 11, if Kansas isn't careful. Houston's defense — which is even better than Cincinnati's — could wreck havoc against Kansas if this offense doesn't snap out of the stagnation.\n\"It just wasn't a very tough team today like we're capable of being,\" Self said. \"Hopefully, we get that mindset corrected here. We'll see…\"Kansas does not lose games at home. This is just the 23rd time that a Self-coached club has lost in this basketball cathedral. Back-to-back home losses feel unfathomable.\"Bad, brutal and it sucks,\" Council said. \"We are supposed to defend homecourt always. Losing to UConn, now Cincinnati. We can't do it no more.\"\nLet the tinkering begin because this team has plenty to learn about itself.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks' unconventional yet successful two-point conversion against the Rams in a Week 16 victory wound up being one of the most",
    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks' unconventional yet successful two-point conversion against the Rams in a Week 16 victory wound up being one of the most consequential plays of the 2025 season.And sources tell CBS Sports the Rams are planning to propose rule changes that would effectively make the play an unsuccessful two-point try.\nThe Rams plan to propose at least one rule change this offseason, sources say, and there may be a second proposal aimed at certain details around that play. Teams regularly submit rules proposals toward the start of the new league year, and many of those proposals come in around the time of next week's NFL Scouting Combine.While the language remains unclear, one source with knowledge of the proposal(s) said the Rams' goal is to \"fix what went wrong in a few places.\"\nThe Rams and Seahawks opened Week 16 on \"Thursday Night Football\" on Amazon Prime. Both teams were 11-3, and the Rams held the tiebreaker for the top seed in the NFC after beating the Seahawks at home in Week 11.The Rams held a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter, and a win would have put L.A. in the driver's seat to win the NFC West and potentially earn the conference's No. 1 position in the coming weeks. But Seattle scored consecutive fourth-quarter touchdowns and trailed 30-28 with 6:23 left. On the Seahawks' two-point conversion attempt, quarterback Sam Darnold attempted a quick pass to running back Zach Charbonnet, but the ball hit Jared Verse's helmet and ultimately fell to the ground with the whistle being blown. Charbonnet, in nonchalant fashion after the whistle was blown, picked the ball up just inside the goal line and then began walking away from the end zone -- the play understood by those on the field to be an incomplete pass and an unsuccessful attempt.\nThe Seahawks eventually lined up for the ensuing kickoff before referee Brad Allen stopped the game to announce the play was under further review. Replay showed that Verse made contact with the ball behind where Darnold released it, making it a lateral. Charbonnet then recovered it in what the NFL rulebook would call the \"immediate continuing action.\" Had it been ruled a fumble, Charbonnet would not have been allowed to advance it on a two-point try. But because it was a backward pass, and because it was considered \"immediate continuing action,\" he could. It officially went down as a successful two-point rush by Charbonnet, tying the game at 30.Amazon Prime officiating analyst Terry McAulay, an NFL official for two decades, noticed the officiating quirk quickly on air before the review was initiated more than a minute and a half after the play was over. Earlier this month, NBC Sports reported McAulay called the league office to discuss the play, which may have led to the review being initiated. A statement by the league noted it is not unusual for the league office to be in contact with the game broadcast.Both teams failed to score in the remainder of regulation, including the Rams missing a 48-yard field goal that could have won the game. In overtime, the Rams scored on the opening possession and made the extra point. The Seahawks responded with a 65-yard touchdown drive of their own and converted a successful two-point attempt to win the game 38-37.\nAfter the game, Rams players and coaches were confused by the ruling. Coach Sean McVay called it \"very interesting\" in his postgame remarks, adding that he didn't get a clear explanation of the rule because the game was going on.\"I've never seen anything or never been a part of anything like that. And I've grown up around this game,\" McVay said. \"I'm not making excuses. We don't do that. I don't believe in that. It doesn't move us forward, but we do want clarity and an understanding of the things that we can do to minimize that when we rejected the two-point conversion.\"The result improved the Seahawks to 12-3 and dropped the Rams to third in the NFC West. Seattle won its next two games, including a division-deciding finale against the 49ers, to win the NFC West and earn the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. The Rams lost the following week to Atlanta, putting them out of reach for the division. L.A. got the fifth seed in the playoffs and played the entire postseason on the road.\nThe two teams met for a third time when they played for the NFC Championship in Seattle, where the home team won 31-27. Seattle went on to trounce the Patriots 29-13 in Super Bowl LX and deliver a second Lombardi to the Pacific Northwest.\n        \n            \n                Prophecies, pressure and a Lombardi Trophy: Inside the Seahawks' Super Bowl run\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne can speculate as to what changes the Rams are seeking. Perhaps they wish to apply the fumble rules on a two-point try to a lateral that has been touched by the defender and goes forward. Or they want to have a time limit for a review to be initiated. The change could be related to the ball being possessed after the whistle blew. It may seek a clearer definition of what \"immediate continuing action\" is. Or it could be none of these.Any team can put forth rule change proposals, and occasionally teams bitten by a certain rule in the previous season will submit a proposal to fix that the following offseason.\nProposals will likely be announced within the next month. From there, the proposal language can be refined up until a vote. Team owners then vote on proposals at the annual league meetings, which this year take place in late March in Phoenix. Twenty-four owners representing a three-fourths majority must agree to the proposal for a rule to change.The Seahawks likely don't see this as a loophole in the rulebook, but clearly the Rams do. And they are seeking to close it on a rare play that may have shaped this year's postseason.\n            ",

The Cowboys made sure to give Williams a deal in line with his market value before he hit free agency to avoid having to replace his strong production from 2025. Williams rushed for 1,201 yards and 11 touchdowns on 252 carries for the Cowboys in 2025 -- reaching career-highs in all three categories. He also caught 35 passes out of the backfield for 137 yards and two touchdowns, providing Dak Prescott with a comfortable check down target. \nWith Williams' deal done, the Cowboys can shift their focus to their other free agents, with wide receiver George Pickens the most notable potential departure. Pickens also had a career-year in his first season in Dallas, tallying 1,429 receiving yards and nine touchdowns to lead the team in both categories. Pickens will be hoping to get a contract that pays him like the top-end receivers in the NFL, but it remains to be seen if Dallas is willing to make such a long-term offer with CeeDee Lamb already on a 4-year, $136 million deal (with $100 million guaranteed). If the two sides can't agree to a new deal, Lamb would be a prime franchise tag target for the Cowboys at a price of $28 million for the 2026 season. \nThe Cowboys have just over two weeks to get a Pickens deal done, but with Williams out of the way it's one fewer concern for Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones and the Cowboys ahead of the March 9 opening for the legal tampering period to free agency. \n            \n",

Our priority is delivering a strong season experience for our student-athletes and our community, and we have great momentum in our football program. During this unprecedented time in college athletics, UCLA will always be guided by what's best for our student-athletes and the Bruin community.\"The decision to remain at the Rose Bowl comes a little over three months after the Rose Bowl and city of Pasadena filed a lawsuit against UCLA last October after plans for the Bruins to move home games out of the storied stadium became public. UCLA's current lease with the Rose Bowl runs through 2044, and the lawsuit alleged the Bruins moving home games to Inglewood would cause more than a billion dollars in damages to the city of Pasadena and its residents. Moving to the newer SoFi Stadium presented an appealing opportunity for UCLA. Not only is it a newer stadium with more amenities, but it's also 13 miles closer to UCLA's campus -- as attendance can be an issue at times for the Bruins at the Rose Bowl. However, with the pending lawsuit over their lease agreement with the Rose Bowl and their effort to build positive momentum within the program after hiring James Madison coach Bob Chesney, the Bruins opted to play in Pasadena without the dispute hanging over the preparations for the 2026 season.\nThe statement does not note what UCLA's long-term future plans will be, and it certainly seems as though this saga will continue into 2027 as the Bruins look to resolve the dispute over their lease with the Rose Bowl and explore their options for moving home games to the Inglewood home of the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers and Rams. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal's disastrous trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers ended with a few familiar crises to haunt Mikel Arteta and his players. Not just those increasingly justifiable questions over whether the league leaders have the hearts and stomachs of winners, but an altogether more fiddly issue -- why do so many of their opponents seem to save their goal of the season for the day when they line up against the Gunners?File Hugo Bueno's whipped strike into David Raya's far post alongside Eli Junior Kroupi's pearler in January, the best of Dominik Szoboszlai's many excellent free kicks, Matheus Cunha's bender into the bottom corner and/or the howitzer from Patrick Dorgu. You wouldn't make Bueno's the pick of the lot -- not when that's your list of nominees -- but as first Premier League goals go, it's not one to be sniffed at.Some of the goals that have beaten David Raya this season are not quite the sort that would have coaches demanding their players what they're doing with that step back, one-legged, do you practice that shot in training nonsense. They're not a million miles from it either though.If it feels like everyone is pinging in their best goals against Arsenal this season, well, maybe there's something in it. Six of the 20 they have conceded in the top flight have an expected goal (xG) value of 0.04, shots that you would expect to be scored once in every 25 attempts. All of those low xG shots have come from outside the box and while eight teams have conceded more long-range efforts than the Gunners, only Brighton get anywhere close to Arsenal's 30% of goals conceded coming from outside the box.\nLow xG, high scoringThose six less than 0.04 xG goals conceded are the joint-most of any team in the Premier League, and most of the rest of the division has a lot more volume to work with. Expand the criteria out to shots worth less than 0.1 xG and you end up with half of the goals this team have conceded. Do so and you're throwing plenty more unlikely goals into the mix. Center back Daniel Ballard charging up the gut to hit a peach of a drive over David Raya, Trevoh Chalobah's brilliant flick over nearly half the outfield players, Tolu Arokodare turning the shot of a Wolves teammate into a goal of his own.All that for a team who has allowed just 19 shots and five goals from shots worth 0.2 xG, both by far the most impressive marks in recent Premier League history. One regular goal against Arsenal. All I ask for. Will never infrequently happen.It is worth noting that Arsenal's total concession is broadly in line with their expected goals tally, 20 against from 207 shots worth 18.08 xG. However something a bit strange happens when you look solely at the xG value of the shots that Arsenal have let in.\nThe 20 shots have a combined xG value of 3.15. Maybe there is nothing particularly too where the goals are conceded, just the fact that they are broadly in line with the trend of the total volume of shots faced, but it is still the case that no Premier League team since the start of the 2020-21 season has a six times overperformance between their goals conceded and the xG value of them. Indeed, prior to that, no team had seen a four-and-a-half times overperformance.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            In short, the way it feels is reflected in reality. Arsenal goals against are golazo-heavy. And doesn't Arteta know it. Unprompted, he made reference to the xG value of Bueno's goal. \"To predict somebody with an 0.02 expected goal shot [sic - sorry but Opta has it at 0.03] ... nobody can really understand that.\"Searching for trendsAsked if this run of low probability goals was chance or something he might be able to address on the training field, Arteta was curiously unequivocal. \"Probably a bit of both,\" he said. \"I think we'll have to go goal by goal.\n\"Somebody from a really low scoring position can put the ball in the top bins, what are the odds for that to happen? I don't know. It depends on the players here in this league. They have a lot of quality as well. So, that's a clue.\"Perhaps we should start, as Arteta wishes, by going through those goals conceded to see if any patterns emerge. Starting with Bueno's there is one trend that does pop up on a few occasions. When a half cleared corner eventually comes to the Wolves left back, Piero Hincapie's instinct is the right one. He wants to show his man down the flank and bait the cross, which will go into an area where Arsenal have a host of bodies that should have no problems getting rid.Bueno finds space to step inside and curl a shot at goal \n                                                                    Premier League\n                                                            Hincapie's problem is that he is just too slow to get out to Bueno, who doesn't really have to adjust to anything the defender is showing him. The Arsenal defender has given his man so much space that by the time Bueno checks inside and shapes to shoot, it is too late. \nThere were similar issues when Kroupi struck for Bournemouth, who had nicely manouevred Arsenal around the pitch when once more they won the second ball off a corner. Hincapie was too slow to follow Kroupi inside as Bournemouth gave and go but he is hardly the only player who could just have done with registering the problem a bit earlier.\n                                                                    Premier League\n                                                            Arsenal have a six-on-five advantage in the backline when the ball is played into Kroupi in space but no one comes out to cover for Hincapie. That probably left the Gunners even more vulnerable, given Kroupi would have been as much of a threat to slip a through ball into that gap between Martin Zubimendi and William Saliba. No one in the visiting team really took ownership of the situation and with that they found themselves having to ride out a deeply uncomfortable final 15 minutes at the Vitality Stadium.You could offer similar critiques when Cunha bent one in to silence the Emirates last month. Having turned Declan Rice, the Manchester United forward found himself driving into altogether too much space with Gabriel perhaps feeling unable to push up as Benjamin Sesko attacked the space in behind him. It is also, possible, however that he defaulted to what has been one of the defining traits of Arteta's excellent Arsenal sides, that they defend the box better than anyone else. \nThere might be an issue for Arsenal when it comes to pressuring long range shooters. Within their own penalty box, the Gunners are outstanding at limiting touches and shots. When they do come, this team blocks shots like they've got Hakeem Olajuwon as their anchor. Outside the area, they don't swarm with quite the same ferocity. In all 47.3% of the shots they've allowed from those spots this season are what Opta terms low pressure shots. That's not the worst in the league but it's below average and it's rare to find a defensive metric where that is the case for Arsenal.\n        \n            \n                Arsenal's block party: How the Gunners defensive line stops shots before they reach goal at exceptional rates\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSagging off shooters might also explain why Arsenal have allowed 23 outside-the-box goals from 16.58 xG over the four seasons of their title contention. That is a 38.7% overperformance by their opponents, above average if we look only at the ever present teams in that timescale. Look at the players who have scored those goals -- more than one for Kevin De Bruyne and Marcus Rashford with smatterings of Bruno Fernandes and Szoboszlai in the mix. Those are the sort who convince Morgan Rogers that his xG when shooting from range is \"a whole load of nonsense\", who justify Arteta's comments that it \"depends on the players here in the league\". It is probably, for instance, not worth giving Cole Palmer much daylight when Chelsea rock up to the Emirates next week. The derby beforehand? *Checks Tottenham's injury list* Yeah, you're probably good.\nIt is, of course worth reaffirming one particular truth about Arsenal. This is a defense that has become the best in the world in no small part because of its ability to keep the other team from getting into the penalty area. If that means giving up long shots, then everything we have learned from the analytics movement is that that is a trade-off you make 100 times out of 100.Maybe if you are so focused on plugging the gaps in your box, you have to be prepared to ride some shooters' luck from range. Arteta, unsurprisingly for a man who arrived in north London intent on his side excelling in every single of the sport, sees it differently. Why not be the best perimeter defense too? \"That's what we want,\" he said. \"There are certain margins there in terms of when we approach the player, the space that you cover in relation to the defender and the keeper. So, there are things that we are constantly working on and try to improve them.\"\nIs the goalkeeper a problem?There was one other factor in Arsenal's problems with long range shot that was consistently mentioned by supporters when I noted just how many worldies were going in their net this season. Like a single, successful and attractive man in his early 30s, all I was hearing was Raya.And while it is rarely wise for a case to be constructed on evidence compiled from Arsenal fans on social media after a bad result, maybe there's something here. After all, there's no denying that of all the goalkeepers to have played in the Premier League since the start of 2023-24, the 6ft 0in Raya is the shortest. Does the average sized shot stopper in their division, all 6ft 3in of him, get a glove on Bueno's goal? Quite possibly, going off the image below.\n                                                                    Premier League\n                                                            Maybe this exact moment reflects the problem with not discriminating for height in goalkeeper recruitment but it is hardly like this has been a problem all through his career. Raya concedes 0.21 goals from outside the box per 90 minutes. The average Premier League goalkeeper concedes 0.23. In his two seasons prior to this he had an 83% success rate at saving shots from range. Again, that is above average.\nArsenal's crisis against long shots?As for this season. Raya's success rate has cratered but has he become an inferior goalkeeper by any other observable facet? Not really. He remains an outstanding sweeper keeper, instinctively excellent when shots are fired his way from close range. It is just that this season when Bueno has took a swing from 20 yards out, he has contrived to hit a shot 6ft 1in outside his reach. You could pick faults in Raya's positioning for Cunha's goal but it's still a spectacular finish to punish a goalkeeper for being half a step too far to his right. Dorgu, Szoboszlai? Put two keepers in the net and those shots aren't getting stopped. Then you round out that sample with Zubimendi giving the ball to Richarlison to lob into an empty net. A few players not timing the ball quite so perfectly and Arsenal's difficulty with long rangers would go unnoticed.There might be some difficulty there. A long trail of xG suggests this is a team conceding a few more than it ought to from range. In all that time though Arsenal have been the best defense in the sport. There is no obvious sign that that has changed since the turn of the year when all these shots have been flying in from range. So why do teams keep scoring wonder goals against Arsenal? Because sometimes random events have the feel of a confluence.\nHow to watch Tottenham vs. Arsenal, oddsDate: Sunday, Feb. 22 | Time: 11:30 a.m. ETLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium -- LondonTV: USA | Live stream: PeacockOdds: Tottenham +480; Draw +290; Arsenal -175\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Updated NCAA Tournament title odds are out with Michigan installed as the frontrunner to win a national championship during March Madness, which would mark the program's first since 1989 under Steve Fisher.Saturday's NCAA March Madness Bracket seeding preview came prior to the Wolverines' showdown at Duke and Houston's bout with Arizona, three of the four teams graced with No. 1 seeds. Coming off wins over Kansas and Houston, Iowa State was the most surprising team to garner top-line billing but is not considered one of the favorites to cut down the nets inside Lucas Oil Stadium on April 6, per oddsmakers.Winners of 11 straight games, Michigan's 25-1 overall this season with its only loss coming on Jan. 10 against Wisconsin. The only competitive game since for the Wolverines was a 75-72 victory over Nebraska a few weeks later, after holding the Huskers scoreless the final 3:20 for their first loss of the campaign.Updated odds to win 2026 NCAA TournamentCheck out the full field of 68 at the CBS Sports Bracketology hub. The odds below are courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.\nMichigan (+320)Ranked No. 1 in the AP poll entering Saturday's game against the Blue Devils, Michigan coach Dusty May has continued to downplay his team's spot in the poll and has his sights set on something far more important -- a deep run in March. Courtesy of a roster UCLA coach Mick Cronin called college basketball's best, Michigan's five starters all average double figures in scoring, and no team is better defensively in the Big Ten than the Wolverines. May knows this is the most complete team he's had in coaching, which includes a Final Four appearance at FAU to cap the 2022-23 season.Duke (+600)Duke's national championship odds will be enhanced with a win over the Wolverines; however, the top priority for the Blue Devils at this point is to maintain their standing as the 1-seed in the East and finish out the regular season with a conference championship. Duke's lone ACC loss came at North Carolina. The rematch with the Tar Heels will be played March 7 before the ACC Tournament begins. Freshman Cameron Boozer will be a featured player in March Madness as one of the nation's premier freshman (22.8 points per game, 10 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.7 blocks per game).\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: 2026 NCAA Tournament committee faces challenges with Michigan, Houston, Florida in same region\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHouston (+600)Independent of his future roster worries with the Cougars, Kelvin Sampson's success this season once again revolves around his guard play. Kingston Flemings and Emanuel Sharp are both providing Houston with 16.5 points per game, and they're scrappy at the defensive end of the floor. Sampson's led Houston to the Final Four twice in the last five seasons, but the Cougars are trying to avoid getting tripped up late in Big 12 play after losing Monday night's trip to Iowa State entering Saturday's affair with Arizona. A matchup with Kansas on the road looms later this week and the Jayhawks and Cougars battle it out for a 2-seed.\nArizona (+600)The Wildcats started the season with 23 consecutive victories before losses to Kansas and Texas Tech this month knocked Arizona off its perch as the nation's hottest team. The nonconference resume features wins over Florida, UCLA, UConn, Auburn and Alabama, truly impressive stuff that reveals a battle-tested squad. Arizona currently holds the same national title odds as Duke and Houston. The Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA Tournament in each of Tommy Lloyd's first four seasons but haven't yet advanced beyond the second weekend.Florida (+1000)Florida maintained its 2.5-game lead in the SEC with its seventh straight win Saturday, a 94-75 drubbing of Ole Miss behind Alex Condon's 24 points. It took some time for the Gators to gel this season with three new pieces in the starting lineup after a culture reset of sorts coming off last season's national title. Following early nonconference losses to Arizona, TCU, Duke and UConn, Florida has hit its stride down the stretch with four games remaining before the conference tournament. The red-hot Gators, unblemished in February with six convincing SEC victories, would have to come out of Midwest as the No. 3 seed to reach the Final Four if the season ended to day. Florida sits at +190 to get to Indianapolis in hopes of retaining its crown.Illinois (+1100)Two of the Fighting Illini's three conference losses in the Big Ten entering Saturday's tilt at UCLA have come by a single possession in overtime to Michigan State and Wisconsin, so there's much to like about a team that has experience in late-game, outcome-deciding situations. Freshman Keaton Wagner (18.1 points per game) is an assassin and had his coming out party last month with a 46-point outburst during a win at Purdue.\nIowa State (+1300)Very much in the thick of it atop the Big 12, the Cyclones' recent wins over Kansas and Houston coming out of a disappointing loss at TCU means they'll have a chance to win the conference down the stretch by winning out. The frontcourt presence of Milan Momcilovic and Joshua Jefferson gives Iowa State a pair of scoring twin towers who have been matchup nightmares for the opposition throughout the campaign. Coach TJ. Otzelberger had a pair of Sweet 16 appearances at Iowa State that preceded last season's disappointing loss to Ole Miss as a No. 3 seed in the second round.UConn (+2200)No surprise to see Dan Hurley's team among the eight FanDuel Sportsbook has installed as +2200 or better title hopefuls. His NCAA Tournament success with two national championships speaks for itself and few coaches nationally get more out of their players than he does. The Huskies' first home conference loss of the season to Creighton earlier this week was in excusable and a bit of a stunner, after which Hurley said his team's effort defensively was a \"joke\" and must be immediately corrected.\n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA has already exceeded its overall medal tally, now at 27, and stands to add to both the overall count and possibly even the gold medal count. A win over Slovakia on Friday would assure the U.S. men's hockey team of some type of medal as it would advance to Sunday's final.On Thursday, figure skater Alysa Liu, 20, became the first American woman to take home a singles gold in 24 years and the U.S. women's hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third period deficit to a 2-1 overtime victory over rival Canada to reach the top of the podium for the first time in eight years. And speedskater Jordan Stolz added to his collection of two previous gold medals with a silver in the men's 1,500 meters.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Entering these Games, Norway had won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

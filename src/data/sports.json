    "body": "\n        There was a major change in the latest set of College Football Playoff Rankings, as Texas A&M dropped out of the top four to No. 7 following its loss to Texas in the final full weekend of the regular season. The Aggies' drop allowed Texas Tech to climb into the top four at No. 4. Georgia also climbed one spot to No. 3 while Ohio State and Indiana remain No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. That wasn't the only notable development in Tuesday's rankings, though. Notre Dame slipped one spot to No. 10 after sitting at nine for several weeks. Alabama leapfrogged the Fighting Irish after closing its season with a narrow 27-20 victory against in-state rival Auburn. The Crimson Tide can cement their status in Saturday's SEC Championship Game clash against Georgia, while Notre Dame -- as an independent -- left its last impression on the selection committee in Week 14. It looks like Ole Miss will be unaffected by coach Lane Kiffin's departure for LSU. The Rebels still rank sixth, which gives them homefield advantage on the projected College Football Playoff bracket. Retaining most of the remaining coaching staff through the postseason at least likely helped Ole Miss' outlook. \nTulane remained as the highest-ranked Group of Five school at No. 20, which would give the Green Wave the No. 12 seed in the projected bracket. Virginia would sit at the 11-seed if it's able to take care of business against Duke in the ACC Championship Game. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            Keep an eye on James Madison James Madison made its College Football Playoff Rankings debut after capping an 11-1 regular season with a 59-10 win against Coastal Carolina. The Dukes, who went undefeated in conference play, will face off against Troy in the Sun Belt Conference Championship Game Friday. That's a potentially huge spot for the Dukes. They'll need some help, but the path to the playoff is there. If Virginia loses in the ACC Championship Game, that would seemingly open one of the five automatic bids. It's hard to imagine a five-loss Duke team vaulting over the likes of James Madison. \nSo there's a scenario where two Group of Five teams make the College Football Playoff. The assumption is that the winner of the American Conference -- either No. 20 Tulane or No. 24 North Texas -- will get an automatic bid no matter what happens. Notre Dame on the ropes? Though Notre Dame fell just one spot to No. 10, that's a very significant development. It means the Fighting Irish are now the last team to make the field with an at-large bid. That's bubble territory. Since Notre Dame doesn't play in a conference title game this week, it technically cannot control its own fate anymore. The Fighting Irish are likely cheering for No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. If No. 11 BYU wins the Big 12 title, there's a strong chance that it supplants Notre Dame as a champion while Texas Tech falls to an at-large spot -- leaving no room for the Fighting Irish. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The penultimate edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings was released Tuesday night with undefeated Ohio State maintaining its grip on the No. 1 spot ahead of Indiana for the fourth straight week as a new team moved into the top four, set to receive a bye through the first round of the bracket. It was a Lone Star State fiasco during Rivalry Week as Texas A&M fell on the road to Texas, vaulting Texas Tech into the No. 4 spot behind Georgia, which moved up one spot, with conference championship games still to play.  The Red Raiders, which have never participated in the playoff, are in the midst of a tremendous 11-1 season under fourth-year coach Joey McGuire. Their 29-7 win over BYU stands as the feather in their cap with the Big 12 Championship Game ahead.  Meanwhile, the reigning national champion Buckeyes are seeking their seventh playoff appearance in 12 years of the postseason bracket's existence (2014, 2016, 2019-20, 2022, 2024). Ohio State will match up with Indiana in the Big Ten Championship Game seeking to go wire-to-wire in the No. 1 spot.  The Buckeyes toppled rival Michigan, 27-9, on Saturday for their first win in The Game since 2019. The Hoosiers demolished Purdue, 56-3, to set up one of the most anticipated clashes in the sport this season.  \nThe Bulldogs is set to play Alabama in the SEC Championship Game with it appearing as if the Crimson Tide have locked up an at-large bid given they moved in front of Notre Dame for the No. 9 spot.  Miami (FL), despite being ranked No. 12, takes the 11th projected bid from the CFP Selection Committee as the highest-rated team from the ACC. However, it will be Virginia squaring off with Duke in the ACC Championship Game, which will award the league's automatic bid as the fourth-highest rated conference title winner. The Hurricanes will have a chance to earn a bid as an at-large team.  Tulane claims the last of the 12 committee-projected playoff spots as the highest-ranked Group of Five team in Tuesday's release at No. 20. However, the Green Wave will face North Texas in the American Championship game with the winner earning a bid given the 12-team playoff model grants automatic entry to the five highest-ranked conference champions.  \nJames Madison is ranked for the first time this week at No. 25. JMU could earn a second Group of Five bid if it wins the Sun Belt and Duke beats UVA in the ACC title game.        College Football Playoff Rankings, Dec. 2  * First-round bye | ~ First-round host | ^ Highest-ranked Group of Five team  Ohio State (12-0) *Indiana (12-0) *Georgia (11-1) *Texas Tech (11-1) *Oregon (11-1) ~Ole Miss (11-1) ~Texas A&M (11-1) ~Oklahoma (10-2) ~Alabama (10-2)Notre Dame (10-2)BYU (11-1)Miami (FL) (10-2)Texas (9-3)Vanderbilt (10-2)Utah (10-2)USC (9-3)Virginia (10-2)Arizona (9-3)Michigan (9-3)Tulane (10-2) ^Houston (9-3)Georgia Tech (9-3)Iowa (8-4)North Texas (11-1)James Madison (11-1)Ole Miss secures home game despite Lane Kiffin's exitAt No. 6 in the updated rankings, the Rebels (11-1) are locked into a first-round home game following Kiffin's departure to LSU. Committee chair Hunter Yurachek previously stated that Kiffin leaving the school for another job would create a new \"data point\" for the committee, but Ole Miss' overall grade was not diminished as a result. Several members of the coaching staff are staying through the postseason, including offensive assistant Charlie Weis Jr., who will call plays in Kiffin's absence. Weis followed Kiffin to Baton Rouge on Sunday but has returned to Ole Miss temporarily to help quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and this offense see it through in the playoff. CBS Sports reported over the weekend the promotion of Pete Golding to head coach was due in part to keep much of what remained of the Rebels' coaching staff intact ahead of the penultimate playoff rankings reveal. Keeping Ole Miss in a first-round home game designation will reportedly generate more than $60 million for Oxford, Mississippi. Kiffin said Sunday he requested to remain with the Rebels through the playoff, but athletic director Keith Carter refused. If the current seeding stands, Ole Miss will host the No. 11 seed -- perhaps the ACC champion -- on Dec. 19 or 20 in the opening round.\nACC vs. Group of FiveNo. 17 Virginia can make it easy on the committee this weekend with a win over Duke in the ACC Championship Game, but a doomsday scenario is on the table for the conference if the Blue Devils upset the Cavaliers. That could bring 25th-ranked James Madison -- the projected champion of the Sun Belt -- into the conversation. If the Dukes beat Troy for a conference title, they could get the 12-seed in Sunday's final bracket with the winner of Tulane-North Texas in the American garnering the No. 11 designation. No. 20 Tulane remains the committee's highest-ranked Group of Five team for the second consecutive week. Looking closer at the metrics, there's a possibility that Duke's strength-of-schedule edge over JMU could potentially put the Blue Devils -- with five losses -- in the playoff if they're ranked higher than the 12-win Dukes on Sunday afternoon should both teams win this weekend. Duke was not ranked in Tuesday's poll.Committee avoids SEC distrust  Alabama's push ahead from No. 10 to No. 9 Tuesday night ahead of Notre Dame means the Crimson Tide (10-2) are safe, independent of Saturday afternoon's result in the SEC Championship Game against third-ranked Georgia. Now, the committee will not have to answer any questions concerning the idea of a three-loss SEC title game loser being left out of the bracket after this decision. If Alabama wins, we're projecting the Crimson Tide to move into first-round bye status with Georgia hosting in the first round. Previously unbeaten Texas A&M sliding to No. 7 was expected after its loss to Texas. The Aggies' lone ranked win this season against a team currently slotted inside the committee's top 25 came at Notre Dame on Sept. 13.\nBYU's simple missionAt No. 11 behind Notre Dame and ahead of Miami, the Cougars are in with a win over Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game. It appears that's the only direct path for two representatives from the conference. Cougars coach Kalani Sitake will be able to maintain his focus on getting this team to the playoff the rest of the week following an extension -- thanks to Crumbl's CEO and other boosters stepping up to keep him -- in wake of his flirtation with Penn State. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark suggested a blind resume grading system Tuesday afternoon ahead of the reveal, effectively backing BYU's at-large stance in case the Cougars fall in their finale. The committee has spoken, however, and that's not going to matter if Texas Tech beats BYU for a second time. \"Let's not look at logos. Let's look at résumés,\" Yormark said. \"Any blind résumé comparison has BYU in the top 10. No question about it. In comparison with Notre Dame as an example, BYU has a better overall record, better strength of record and better strength of schedule. I am confident that the CFP will get it right for BYU.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Days ahead of the Big 12 Championship Game between BYU and Texas Tech, the Cougars have agreed to a long-term contract extension with coach Kalani Sitake. Sitake emerged as the target of Penn State's search on Monday, per multiple sources. He was offered by the Nittany Lions and momentum seemed to be trending toward the 50-year-old taking the Penn State job. However, sources told CBS Sports that BYU made an aggressive push over the last 24 hours to keep Sitake home. That culminated Tuesday when BYU announced its new deal with Sitake. \"We are excited to announce a long-term agreement to extend Kalani Sitake as BYU's head football coach,\" athletic director Brian Santiago said. \"He is a proven leader, and we are grateful he is once again choosing BYU. His legacy of building a championship program the BYU way will continue on. He is one of the best people in the business. We are excited to continue to ride the wave of positive momentum with him.\"All of this came to a head the day before the start of the early signing period and just a few days out from BYU's first appearance in the Big 12 title game. The 11th-ranked Cougars (11-1) remain a strong College Football Playoff contender and would clinch a spot in the 12-team bracket with a win over No. 4 Texas Tech on Saturday. Amid all the Penn State discourse that emerged Monday, Sitake met with his team, per a source. He didn't shoot down the Penn State rumors in that meeting. \n\n        \n            \n                Penn State's cookie problem: Crumbl CEO, other BYU donors make push to keep Kalani Sitake in Provo\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut the BYU donor base has deep pockets, including Crumbl founder Jason McGowan, and they rallied to keep Sitake, an alumnus of the program, for the foreseeable future. \"I am humbled and full of gratitude for the outpouring of love from BYU fans and the trust and support provided to our football program by our university leadership,\" Sitake said. \"I'm thankful to President Shane Reese, Vice President Keith Vorkink and our Athletic Director Brian Santiago and his leadership team for the confidence they continue to place in me to lead our program and to take care of our players, coaches and staff. This is good for the stability and future of BYU football. I'm excited about our future.\" Sitake is in Year 10 with the Cougars and has a 83-44 overall record with the school. He helped BYU navigate the transition to the Big 12 in 2023. The Cougars are 22-3 over the last two seasons. \nPenn State's coaching search has been a labored and secretive process, with a wide range of candidates rumored. Coaches who have been linked with the process include those like Vanderbilt's Clark Lea, Missouri's Eli Drinkwitz and Nebraska's Matt Rhule. All three have received contract extensions since the job opened. Interim head coach Terry Smith has also been a factor in the search.  \n            ",

The winner of Friday night's matchup with No. 20 Tulane is expected to earn a spot in the CFP.\"I am incredibly excited about the opportunity to partner with [athletic director] Jared [Mosley] in leading North Texas Football,\" Brown said. \"Football in Texas is special and my family and I can't wait to pour everything we have into the North Texas campus and Denton. Most importantly, our program will always be a player-driven program, and I look forward to getting to know this team and building our roster for the future!

He went 37-35 overall in Morgantown with a 25-28 mark in Big 12 play. The Mountaineers went 22-25 combined in his first four years before a breakthrough 9-4 record in 2023. However, after going 6-6 in 2024, West Virginia decided to dismiss Brown. \nBrown landed at WVU after starring at Troy from 2015-18, leading the Trojans to 35 victories, including three bowl wins, and a Sun Belt title over four seasons. The height of Brown's offensive success with his tempo-based NASCAR philosophy came in 2017 when he lifted Troy to a win over LSU, snapping the Tigers' 46-game non-conference home winning streak. The Trojans went on to finish with an 11–2 overall record, the program's best regular-season finish since joining the FBS in 2001.Before his time at Troy, Brown served as the offensive coordinator at Texas Tech and Kentucky.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome Neal Brown as our next head football coach,\" Mosley said. \"Neal is a proven leader who builds programs with integrity, vision and an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of elevating rosters, developing talent and producing results in highly competitive leagues makes him an ideal fit for North Texas. We are confident that his leadership will position the Mean Green for sustained success, and we look forward to the impact he and his family will have on our program and our community for years to come.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent starter Cody Ponce on a three-year pact worth $30 million, according to MLB.com's Mark Feinsand. Ponce is the second starter the Blue Jays have added in the past week. They also officially announced their seven-year deal with Dylan Cease, a $210 million pact that's the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the Toronto franchise. Ponce, 31, has not pitched at the MLB level since 2021. He spent last season with the Hanwha Eagles of the Korea Baseball Organization, starting 29 times and amassing a 1.89 ERA and a 6.15 strikeout-to-walk ratio. CBS Sports ranked Ponce as the 45th-best player on the market. Here's what we wrote at the time:Ponce, 32 come April, will return stateside after spending a few years overseas, first in Japan and then in South Korea. He'll look nothing like he did during his first 20 career MLB appearances. These days, he's capable of touching into the upper-90s with his heater and throws, among other secondaries, a quality splitter. There are enough KBO-to-MLB pitching success stories -- ranging from someone with staying power, in Merrill Kelly, to more fleeting cases, like Erick Fedde and Chris Flexen -- to envision a team giving Ponce a rotation spot on a multi-year pact to demonstrate where he lands on that spectrum.Here's more to know about the Ponce signing.The Blue Jays have a rotation surplusIn addition to Cease and Ponce, the Blue Jays had Shane Bieber remain in his contract rather than execute an opt-out clause and enter free agency. Factor in Kevin Gausman, star rookie Trey Yesavage, and José Berríos, and Toronto has the luxury of having more capable starters than rotation slots. And that's without mentioning Bowden Francis, who has started nearly 30 times the past two years, or Eric Lauer, who had a 3.18 ERA in 104 innings in 2025.PitcherIPERASO/BBKevin Gausman1933.593.78Trey Yesavage (MLB)143.212.29Shane Bieber40.13.575.29José Berríos1664.172.46Dylan Cease1684.553.03Cody Ponce (KBO)180.21.896.15Of course, that's a good problem to have at this or any point in time because it gives the Blue Jays options and contingency plans. They can entertain trading from that group, and they can toy with shifting a couple members to the bullpen. They can also enter camp knowing that if and when an injury happens -- and pitchers are known for getting hurt on occasion -- they have internal backups already in place.\nKeep in mind, the Blue Jays didn't have that luxury entering last year, when they had to rush to sign Spencer Turnbull and José Ureña to serve as stopgaps on an injury-ravaged staff.Bullpen, shortstop remain questions for AL champsWhat else do the defending American League champions need to do this winter? A few things.Foremost, the Blue Jays have been linked to most of the high-leverage relievers of note, including right-hander Pete Fairbanks. It stands to reason they'll attempt to add quality instead of quantity to their relief corps. That's because Toronto is starting to run into a numbers game with its pitching staff. With Ponce included, the Blue Jays now have nine pitchers who cannot be optioned to the minors. If Yesavage is part of the Opening Day rotation -- and you would assume he is -- then Toronto really has only three \"flex\" spots, depending on how they proceed with the rest of the winter. \nElsewhere, the Blue Jays have to figure out if they're going to retain free agent Bo Bichette, turn to an internal replacement, or try to land a new shortstop from outside the organization. Bichette, considered one of the best free agents available, hasn't yet generated much rumor mill buzz ahead of the start of next week's Winter Meetings. Should the Blue Jays stay in house, the path of least resistance would have them slide Andrés Giménez to short and install Ernie Clement at second base. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association recently agreed to a 40-day extension of the current collective bargaining agreement, pushing the deadline to get a new CBA done to Jan. 9, 2026. Upon agreeing to the extension, the WNBPA released a statement saying, \"We expect substantive movement from the league within this window.\"Sure enough, it didn't take long to learn that the league had delivered a new offer with improved salaries: max contracts with a $1 million base salary (open to multiple players on the same team), an average salary above $500,000 and a minimum salary above $225,000, a source with knowledge of the situation told CBS Sports. Furthermore, the offer would raise the salary cap from $1.5 million to $5 million, and further growth would be tied to revenue growth, though the specific machinations for that are unclear. \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA proposal would push max player salary to $1 million, raise cap to $5 million\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThose pay raises -- the current regular max contract is $214,466 and the current veteran minimum is $78,831 -- would not come without a cost. According to Annie Costabile of Front Office Sports, the league has also proposed lengthening the season and eliminating player housing subsidies. A source with knowledege of the situation confirmed to CBS Sports that the league's proposal would eliminate housing benefits, but indicated that any discussion regarding training camps potentially starting earlier than April 1 is merely an opportunity to explore the potential footprint of the season and ways to further generate revenue.\nIf implemented, such changes would radically alter how the WNBA operates and would have potentially severe effects for rookies and players on short-term contracts, as well as the WNBA's relationship with the NCAA, FIBA and other leagues. Changes to the schedule could be catastrophic on multiple frontsLet's first examine the potential schedule changes first reported by FOS and confirmed by CBS Sports:The league has also proposed lengthening the season, including an earlier start date that is expected to interfere with the NCAA tournament and potentially other leagues like Project B. The start date for training camp could be as early as mid-March, sources indicated. Historically, training camps have begun in late April, following the conclusion of the NCAA season and the draft, though the league is allowed to begin them as early as April 1 under the current CBA. Moving the start of training camp to mid-March -- just as the NCAA Tournament is getting underway -- would raise a series of questions:1. What happens with the draft?Moving the start of training camp to mid-March leaves no good option for the draft. \nHistorically, the draft has taken place in mid-April, following the conclusion of the Final Four. A mid-March start for training camp suggests an early-to-mid April start for the season, and it wouldn't make sense to hold the draft after the season has already started. On the other hand, moving the draft to early March, before the NCAA season has come to a close, would force teams and players into early decisions they may not be entirely comfortable with. While conference tournaments and the NCAA Tournament are not the be-all and end-all of scouting, they provide valuable insight into how players perform under pressure.2. What are rookies supposed to do?Regardless of when the draft takes place in this hypothetical new schedule, rookies would be left in the lurch. \nMoving the draft to early March would create a scenario where players are drafted while still playing for their college teams. Leaving the draft in mid-April may mean players are drafted after the WNBA season has already started. If the draft gets moved up, would players feel pressure to leave school early so they could participate in training camp? Would that even be allowed? The nature of the NCAA Tournament means that some rookies will be done with their collegiate seasons weeks before other rookies, which could create a significant advantage for certain rookies and teams. If players opt to finish their collegiate season, they could be thrown into the WNBA season without a training camp.It's already extremely difficult for rookies drafted outside of the first round to make a roster. These potential changes could make it nearly impossible. Unless roster sizes were increased, there would be no incentive for teams to hold open roster spots for second- and third-round picks during training camp or the beginning of the season. And outside of their college tape, there would be no way for players who don't participate in training camp to prove they deserve a spot. 3. An attempt to derail other leagues?\nIt seems obvious that a primary reason the WNBA is raising the possibility of starting training camp in mid-March is to disrupt other leagues, including Unrivaled, Athletes Unlimited and, in particular, the newly announced Project B. An earlier start would also impact players who play in European, Asian and Australian leagues. Unrivaled, which was co-founded by Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, will employ 54 WNBA players this season and is set to run from Jan. 5 through March 4. Athletes Unlimited has 33 players listed on its roster page, though not all of them are current WNBA players. Their month-long season will run from Feb. 1 through March 1. Project B is not slated to start until the fall of 2026, but it appears to be the biggest potential competitor to the WNBA and has already signed a number of stars to seven-figure contracts, including Nneka Ogwumike, Alyssa Thomas and Jonquel Jones. The league, which has significant financial backing, would play from November until April in cities across Asia and Europe. \"It's very clear that the league wants to push away all other leagues,\" Seattle Storm star Gabby Williams said over All-Star Weekend. \"It would make sense if they were paying us more here, but it still isn't the case, even with the new proposals. And it's very clear now that they wanna push Unrivaled out, push AU out.\"\nThe league's prioritization clause, which was introduced in the most recent CBA and requires (with some exceptions) players to be in market for the start of training camp, has been a sore spot, particularly for international players. For now, the WNBA remains signed on to FIBA's \"letter of clearance\" system, which allows players to participate in multiple leagues.As salaries rise, it's reasonable for the league and owners to want to protect their investment. If teams are now paying some players over $1 million, it makes sense that they don't want them playing year-round or potentially getting hurt in another league. Stars -- many of whom can also make real money off the court -- might be fine with that reality, but what about players making the minimum or fighting to stay in the league? A player earning the new minimum of $225K who is potentially no longer able to play in other leagues may actually be taking a pay cut overall. And that's before taking into account the potential loss of housing benefits. \nHousing benefits on the chopping block?Here's FOS on that front:Under the current CBA, players have multiple options during the regular season and the playoffs for housing. Players can either stay in housing provided by the team or receive a monthly stipend, which varies by city; players with children under the age of 13 receive a two-bedroom unit. The monthly stipend for players who opt not to live in team-provided housing ranges between $1,177 in Las Vegas to $2,647 in New York. If housing benefits are eliminated, players could lose roughly $8-18K, depending on where they play and whether their team makes the playoffs. That's a sizeable loss, particularly for players in expensive markets such as New York, Golden State, Chicago and Toronto. The housing benefits also set up a conflict between stars and players fighting to stay in the league. For players in line to make the max, especially those with substantial off-court income, giving up the housing stipend for a higher salary is an excellent deal. A player such as Breanna Stewart could go from making $220K in 2025 to north of $1 million in 2026 under this latest offer. What's roughly $18K in that scenario? About 0.02% of her new salary. For someone like Stewart's Liberty teammate Kennedy Burke, who was on the veteran minimum and doesn't have major endorsements, it's a substantial chunk of change. Her salary would potentially rise from $78,831 to north of $225K with this latest offer, but she would lose about $18K in the process, or 8% of her new salary. Players on short-term deals would also be major losers if the housing benefits disappear. Due to small roster sizes, teams are routinely bringing in players on hardship contracts for weeks at a time. If team housing is no longer available, will they have to stay in hotels for the duration of that period? And pay out of their own pocket? It's worth noting that without having access to the full proposal, it's possible that exceptions to the housing benefits are outlined for players on short-term deals. \nSimply a negotiating tactic?The WNBA's proposal is a logistical nightmare, not only for other leagues, but for itself. It would devalue the draft, derail rookie development and potentially encourage players to ply their trade elsewhere. It's hard to imagine any scenario in which the players would accept these terms.It makes you wonder, then, if these proposals are simply a negotiating tactic from the WNBA. If the players push back, as they likely will, the WNBA can then try to extract a concession from them in order to maintain the current schedule and/or housing benefits. Whatever the case may be, this episode is another reminder that the league's willingness to raise salaries is not enough to get a deal done. There's still a long way to go before the two sides agree to a new CBA. \n            ",

The Steelers have reportedly filled Slay's roster spot with Asante Samuel Jr., who made his season debut during Pittsburgh's Week 13 loss to the Buffalo Bills.  A six-time Pro Bowler, Slay was part of the Steelers' re-vamped secondary that also included the acquisition of seven-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Injuries, however, and inconsistent performances ultimately led to Slay losing his starting job to James Pierre prior to Pittsburgh's Week 12 loss to the Chicago Bears. Slay was a healthy scratch during this past Sunday's 26-7 loss to Buffalo. Slay's release comes just several weeks after Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said that -- when healthy -- Slay would continue to remain in the starting lineup. Hours before releasing Slay, Tomlin said that him being a healthy scratch this past Sunday was less about Slay and more about him wanting to give Samuel (a former second-round pick who joined Pittsburgh's practice squad last month) an opportunity to play. \nWhile Slay begins the process of looking for his next opportunity, the Steelers will once again have to made sudden adjustments to a secondary that has already gone through threw a myriad of them through the season's first 12 weeks. Pittsburgh started the season with Slay, Ramsey and Joey Porter Jr. as their starting cornerbacks and Juan Thornhill and DeShon Elliott as their starting safeties. On Sunday, Pierre is slated to continue starting alongside Porter and Brandin Echols, who entered the starting lineup after Ramsey was moved to free safety after Thornhill was released. Kyle Dugger, who was acquired via a trade with the New England Patriots on Oct. 31, has replaced an injured Elliott at starting strong safety. \nThe Steelers' pass defense -- which is currently 28th in the NFL in passing yards allowed -- will face another stiff test Sunday in Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who has also faced his share of struggles this season. Over his past four games, Jackson has completed well under 60% of his pass attempts with just one touchdown and three interceptions. \n            \n    ",

Even this season, despite the injuries, only Giannis Antetokounmpo is scoring more points in the paint per game than he is. There's a superstar in there. The Pelicans have spent seven years trying to find it. But we may finally have reached a breaking point here.The Pelicans turned over their front office last offseason. While Joe Dumars and Troy Weaver haven't exactly earned plaudits for their work in New Orleans thus far, they have less invested in Williamson than the previous regime did. They even traded a haul to get his replacement. The early returns on Derik Queen have been quite positive. He ranks seventh among rookies in scoring, fourth in assists and third in rebounding. The early returns on the Queen-Williamson partnership? That's more of a mixed bag. The Pelicans score 120.3 points per 100 possessions when they share the floor... but allow 123.3, according to Cleaning the Glass. Their offensive upside is considerable. You won't find many more skilled pairs of big men. They are untenable together defensively. Neither protects the rim. In a perfect world, you'd pair Queen with a defensive-minded center who could maybe shoot the occasional 3 to offer some extra spacing. You want the ball in Queen's hands. That's why you paid what might become the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NBA Draft to get him. Between Queen, Jeremiah Fears and Trey Murphy, there are suddenly a fair number of mouths to feed in New Orleans.\nWilliamson outranks all of them on stature. He leads the team in usage by a meaningful margin, which creates an uncomfortable dynamic when these injuries inevitably arise. The Pelicans are one sort of team with him and an entirely different team without him. It's hard to know on a week-to-week basis which one they'll be. That makes planning for the future and developing younger talent significantly harder. Continuity and stability are essential to growth. The Pelicans haven't had much of either since Williamson's arrival. Now that Queen is in place, it's time to begin thinking more realistically about life after Zion.Normally, this is part where we'd cover which teams might be interested in Williamson and what sort of return New Orleans might be able to get for him. At this point, though, the idea of some team wanting him enough to trade a substantial package is unrealistic. If the Pelicans can't rely on him, it seems unlikely that another team could. Williamson's true value right now lies in his contract, not his production.Williamson is owed max money in both the 2026-27 and 2027-28 seasons, but with a caveat. At the moment, none of that money is guaranteed. According to The Athletic's Mike Vorkunov, 20% of his annual salary each season is guaranteed based on six weight check ins. The remaining 80% guarantees based on a games-played threshold: 40% for 41 games or more, another 20% for 51 games, and then the final 20% for 61 or more games. His team can't control the weight check ins, but the remaining 80% is another story. Some team could simply trade for Williamson, not play him, and then waive him to get off of the majority of his contract.\nIn other words, some team with a big, guaranteed contract it would like to dump could send that money to New Orleans in exchange for Williamson and plan to waive him thereafter for the savings. The value the Pelicans could generate would therefore be however much a team is willing to pay to get off a bad contract, which would of course vary by the contract in question. Depending on how much bad money they'd be willing to take on, the return could therefore be minimal or substantial. Given how reluctant this team has historically been to spend, the true answer is probably somewhere in between. Hopefully, it would be closer to the latter. With Williamson gone, the Pelicans would not be slated to employ any of the NBA's 50 most expensive players next season. They can afford to wait out a bad contract. This rebuild is going to take time.The longer the Pelicans wait to move here, the longer that rebuild is going to take. Sometimes, a breakup is just in everyone's best interests. Williamson, given his injury history, frankly shouldn't shoulder the load New Orleans has asked of him anymore. He should be playing 20 minutes a game on a better, more stable team at a substantially reduced salary. He's not a max player anymore. So long as he remains with the Pelicans, he's burdened by those expectations. They hold him back, but they also hold the team back.\nIt's time to see what they really have with Queen and Fears, to hand more of the team over to Murphy, and yes, probably tank for a few years to try to add to this young core even with their 2026 pick going to Atlanta. How many injury-related press releases can one team release before enough is enough?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It looks like the Oregon Ducks will see both of their coordinators leave for head-coaching jobs at the end of their College Football Playoff run, as Tosh Lupoi is on the verge of returning to his alma mater to be the next coach at Cal, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer. Lupoi, the defensive coordinator for Dan Lanning ever since he took over at Oregon in 2022, has emerged as the top target of Cal's search after the school fired Justin Wilcox. Lupoi, 44, played defensive line at Cal from 2000-05 and began his coaching career as Cal's defensive line coach from 2008-11. From there, he worked as a defensive assistant at Washington and Alabama before stints as the defensive line coach for three NFL teams -- the Cleveland Browns, Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars. At Alabama, Lupoi worked his way up from an analyst in 2014 to defensive coordinator in 2018 under Nick Saban, earning a reputation as a strong recruiter. His defense at Oregon has been among the best in the country, finishing the 2025 regular season eighth nationally in scoring defense at 14.8 points per game allowed. Should the deal be finalized, Lupoi will head back down the coast to Berkeley to take over a Cal team that finished 7-5 this season, but general manager Ron Rivera fired Wilcox after nine seasons at the helm following an embarrassing 31-10 rivalry loss to Stanford on Nov. 23. Wilcox had a 48-55 overall record at Cal, including a combined 12-12 (5-10 ACC) mark in two seasons since the program transitioned from the Pac-12 to the ACC. \n\n        \n            \n                Kentucky hires Will Stein: Wildcats tab Oregon offensive coordinator after firing Mark Stoops\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe first order of business for Lupoi will be attempting to keep star freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele from entering the transfer portal. Sagapolutele completed 63.6% of his passes for 3,116 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a true freshman starter, at times putting a tantalizing display of talent on the field that points to an extremely bright future. If Lupoi can keep Sagapolutele as a Golden Bear, he'll have a great chance to hit the ground running with a team that can compete in the ACC. Cal will expect Lupoi to be able to improve their defense that finished the season 76th in the country in scoring defense, allowing 26.5 points per game. \nLanning now faces the challenge many top programs do after finding consistent success, as he has to replace both of his coordinators. Along with Lupoi's looming departure to Cal, offensive coordinator Will Stein is returning to his home state of Kentucky to coach the Wildcats, and Lanning will have to identify two new coordinators to take over for the Ducks in 2026. \n            ",

Thielen, after being waived Monday, will get a chance to do just that after being claimed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday, per NFL Media. The Vikings traded for Thielen prior to the start of the regular season, as their wide receiving corps was hit hard by injuries. However, in 11 games played this year, Thielen caught just eight passes for 69 yards. He was made a healthy scratch this past week, as the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0.\n        \n            \n                Vikings release Adam Thielen: Minnesota parts ways with veteran WR, who wants larger role before retiring\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThielen was productive for the Carolina Panthers over the last two seasons, crossing 1,000 yards receiving in 2023, and averaging 61.5 receiving yards per contest in 10 games played in 2024. Thielen, in his 12th NFL season, was picked up by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013 and ended up playing nine years for the team. He ranks fourth in franchise history in receptions (542), fifth in receiving yards (6,751) and third in receiving touchdowns (55).In Pittsburgh, Thielen joins a wide receiving corps headlined by DK Metcalf, although he is the only pass-catcher to cross 300 yards receiving this season. In Thielen, Aaron Rodgers acquires a veteran playmaker that can move the chains.\nThe 6-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North race. The Baltimore Ravens, also at 6-6, own the tiebreaker, while the 4-8 Cincinnati Bengals are lurking in the background with Joe Burrow back in the fold. Pittsburgh has a 44.8% chance to win the division, and 45.1% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays have reached an agreement with free-agent right-hander Dylan Cease on a seven-year pact worth $210 million, the team announced Tuesday. This marks the largest free-agent contract ever handed out by the franchise, topping George Springer's six-year agreement worth $150 million. Cease, who turns 30 next month, is fresh off a disappointing season. He posted a 4.55 ERA (94 ERA+) and a 3.03 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 32 starts with the San Diego Padres. Cease's arsenal continued to grade favorably, however, leading CBS Sports to rank him as the 11th-best free agent available. Here's what we wrote:Here's one for the dip buyers. Cease notched his fifth campaign in a row with 32 or more starts but, despite underlying data that bore resemblance to his past efforts, posted the worst full-season ERA+ of his career. Teams may ask themselves: what was going on with his slider? Cease is a two-pitch pony (fastballs and sliders combined for a usage rate over 80%), yet he tinkered with his top breaker, throwing it harder with less depth and sweep. His results were worse, suggesting he should revert. True in one way, true in multiple ways.Cease's contract is tied for the seventh largest free-agent deal ever given to a starting pitcher. He will join a Blue Jays rotation that figures to also include Kevin Gausman, rookie sensation Trey Yesavage, José Berríos, and Shane Bieber, who opted in to his contract earlier this winter. \nToronto won the American League pennant and AL East in 2025, falling two outs short against the Dodgers of their first World Series title since 1993.Here are three other things to know about this deal.\n1. Fourth richest contract among active pitchersOnce pen is put to paper, Cease will become one of the highest paid pitchers in the sport, as judged by total value. Do not that the list below excludes Shohei Ohtani on the grounds that he's a two-way player.Dodgers RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto: $325MYankees RHP Gerrit Cole:                     $324M Yankees LHP Max Fried:                       $218M Blue Jays RHP Dylan Cease: $210M Diamondbacks RHP Corbin Burnes:                 $210MIt's worth pointing out that Cease's contract doesn't rank as highly when judged by average annual value. Then he falls to sixth behind Zack Wheeler, Jacob deGrom, Blake Snell, Cole, and Burnes, so far a multi-year contracts go. (Seth Lugo also has him beat if one-year deals are taken into consideration.)2. Why the Blue Jays chose Cease over Valdez, othersA fair question to ask in the wake of this signing is, well, why Cease? If the Blue Jays were deadset on adding a free-agent starter, why didn't they opt instead for left-hander Framber Valdez, Ranger Suárez, or any of the other free-agent options available to them.The Blue Jays will probably never provide the actual answer, but it seems reasonable to guess that it's because Cease is the most dynamic pitcher of the bunch. Indeed, he's struck out nearly 11 batters per nine innings for his career, as compared to Valdez's 8.9 and Suárez's 8.3 figures.\nAs an added bonus, Cease will add variety to a Blue Jays rotation that ranked 14th in the majors in strikeout rate. Rest assured, that won't be the case with him in tow.3. Good sign for other startersEven with the above subheading taken into consideration, you can bet that Valdez and other starters are tickled to see Cease's contract come in high.That's because the free-agent market is largely based on precedent. The agents for those pitchers can now argue that if Cease received this much, their client ought to receive at least the same.\nObviously that argument isn't guaranteed to end in a similarly lucrative contract. But those players and their agents have a better leg to stand on when they're making them now than they did coming into the week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss announced Tuesday that offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. will remain with the Rebels through their expected College Football Playoff appearance. Weis is still expected to follow former Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin to LSU at the conclusion of the season. Kiffin officially departed Oxford for LSU on Sunday, ending a weeks-long saga that played out amid a historic season for Ole Miss. In a statement, Kiffin said he is supportive of Weis remaining with the Rebels through the postseason. \"With the playoff committee releasing updated rankings tonight, I wanted it to be known that after conversations with LSU, we are allowing Charlie to return to Ole Miss to coach the team during the playoffs,\" Kiffin said. \"I've already made the committee aware of this and I'm hopeful this decision will allow Ole Miss to receive the highest ranking possible because these great players are very deserving of that. I'm excited that Charlie will be back to help coach the greatest team in the history of Ole Miss.\" \nWeis will work under new coach Pete Golding, who was tabbed as Kiffin's permanent successor shortly after Kiffin departed for Baton Rouge. Quarterbacks coach Joe Judge, running backs coach Kevin Smith and offensive line coach John Garrison will also remain with the Rebels through the playoff, at least. \"I'm grateful to LSU for allowing me the opportunity to finish this season with Ole Miss,\" Weis wrote in a statement. \"Coach Kiffin and the LSU administration have been nothing but supportive. I'm excited about the playoff run.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA majority of Ole Miss' defensive staff remains intact. Secondary coach Bryan Brown is taking Golding's former role as Ole Miss' defensive coordinator. Ole Miss finished the regular season atop the SEC and ranked third nationally in total offense (498.1 yards per game) and finished third in the conference in scoring offense (37.3 points per game). The Rebels were the only SEC team to average at least 300 yards passing and 180 yards rushing per contest. While Ole Miss was willing to allow Weis back into the fold for a month, it did not budge on Kiffin. Though Kiffin claims he wanted to remain in Oxford for the College Football Playoff after he accepted the LSU job, the Rebels informed him that was not possible. \n\"I hate that I didn't get to explain to the players why,\" Kiffin said during his introductory press conference. \"But I also totally respect and understand the decision they felt they had to make for the program.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The finish line ribbon is within reach.Signing Day looms. It is one of the biggest checkpoints in the talent acquisition calendar, with high school recruits in the 2026 class set to make things official with their respective college football programs.Here is a quick-hit user guide to get you ready for the start of the Early Signing Period (Dec. 3-5). Watch our National Signing Day show LIVE starting at 10 a.m. ET on the CBS Sports College Football YouTube page for commitments, analysis and reactions. \nGrab a 247Sports subscription today to get inside scoop on your favorite team, expert analysis and opinion on all the day's biggest news and read content across the 247Sports network. \nWhy will Signing Day be so quiet? More than 95% of the recruits in the Top247 rankings had made their college commitments ahead of the college season, a trend that has become more prevalent in the Name, Image and Likeness era as prospects secure agreements early in the process.Signing Day has lost the theatrics. College coaches no longer jostle for the final in-home meeting with a prospect's family, instead handing off most of the responsibility to the program's talent acquisition group.Live announcements, and their accompanying drama, now take place in the spring and summer when recruits are busy wrapping up official visits to schools. Flips and decommitments ramped up the level of activity toward the end of October -- a byproduct of a constantly spinning coaching carousel -- yet it's still expected to be a calm Signing Day.\nPerhaps no statistic is more indicative of how sewn-up recruiting has become than this: the top 13 teams in the Composite Team Recruiting Rankings on the eve of Signing Day were all within the top 13 at the start of the season.Any wiggle room in race for No. 1?With five-star Jared Curtis flipping his commitment from Georgia to Vanderbilt, it's a matter of when, not if, USC signs the nation's top-ranked class.The Bulldogs needed to hang onto Curtis, whom they initially beat out Oregon for, and a few other things to go their way on the flip front for them to chase down the Trojans from behind but now that scenario is out the window.\nAlabama now sits in the No. 2 spot entering the final hours before signatures begin trickling in. A few prospects remain in play for the Tide, including four-star offensive tackle Bryson Cooley, an LSU commit from the state of Mississippi that Lane Kiffin would surely love to hang onto.But any addition from the Tide would theoretically be for naught from a rankings standpoint given that USC appears to be in prime position to land a flip of its own. Blue-chip wide receiver Kayden Dixon-Wyatt, who has been committed to Ohio State since May, could be leaning toward staying out West to play for the Trojans.If USC finishes in first place, it would be the first time since 2008 that a non-SEC program secured the top spot in the recruiting rankings.\nThree players to keep an eye on Wednesday \nChris Henry Jr., WR, Ohio State commitWill the five-star prospect from powerhouse Santa Ana (Calif.) Mater Dei follow through with his longstanding commitment to Ohio State or flip to Oregon? Henry, the son of the late Chris Henry, has continued to be a top priority for Dan Lanning and his staff, despite being on the Buckeyes' list of commits since July 2023. When asked about his status after Mater Dei's final game this season, Henry fanned the flames even further by declining to discuss his recruitment. Could this be a leverage play, which are commonplace in the age of NIL? The Buckeyes continue to feel good about Henry inking his paperwork.\nKayden Dixon-Wyatt, WR, Ohio State commitThe nation's No. 6-rated receiver looks much likelier to flip from the Buckeyes than Henry, his high school teammate. Sources out West have suggested that USC has done a terrific job of sustaining the relationship. Considering the success of pass-catchers like Makai Lemon and Ja'Kobi Lane, on top of the production from true freshman Tanook Hines this season, sources close to the recruitment acknowledge that the opportunity to feature in a Lincoln Riley offense might be too good to decline.\nCarter Gooden, EDGE, UCLAA commit to UCLA since the summer, Gooden has remained in the Bruins' class despite the firing of DeShaun Foster and subsequent coaching search. But it's always an eye-popping development when a committed prospect has an announcement to make, and that's what the nation's No. 90 overall player plans to do live on the CBS Sports College Football YouTube channel on Wednesday. Vanderbilt and Tennessee have continued to lurk, and the high-upside Gooden would be a coup for both SEC programs. The Commodores could be in line for a huge day after the flip of Curtis, while the Volunteers would also be an enticing destination for Gooden whose projectable frame aligns with how they have built their depth in the trenches.\nWhich new coach is being the most active?With just eight names on the Virginia Tech commitment list when James Franklin took the helm on Nov. 17, things were looking bleak on the doorstep of the Early Signing Period.The Hokies ranked 124th overall in the Composite recruiting standings, and were in danger of finishing outside the top 50 for just the second time in the modern recruiting era.Fast forward to this week and it's been flip after flip for Franklin, who needed only two weeks on the job to essentially raid Penn State's class and help Virginia Tech ascend to No. 32 overall.\nFranklin and Co. might not be done -- four-star safety Matt Sieg, a longtime commit to Penn State, is another player who plans to announce a final decision Wednesday on the CBS Sports College Football YouTube channel. The Hokies are battling hometown Pitt for Sieg at the finish line.A large group of visitors that made it to Blacksburg for the Miami game on Nov. 22 set the table for the impressive turnaround, providing a glimpse of what Franklin aspires to accomplish on the recruiting trail.The Hokies haven't signed a top-20 class since 2008, but if the buzz around the program is any indication the Hokies could be a team to monitor closely next cycle.\n            ",

At least, that's what she posted on social media after speculation heated up on Tuesday when it was reported that the 23-time major champion was back in the drug testing pool.Williams re-entered the International Tennis Integrity Agency's registered testing pool, a requirement before returning to the sport, back in October, a spokesperson for the ITIA confirmed to The Athletic.\"I do not know if this means she is coming back, or just giving herself the option,\" the spokesperson said via The Athletic. \"All I can say is she's back in the pool and therefore subject to whereabouts.\"But Williams posted on X shortly after to dispel any rumors or speculation.\nWhen Williams, 44, announced she was stepping away from tennis in August 2022 in the form of a first-person essay in Vogue, she steered clear of using the word \"retirement,\" saying \"It doesn't feel like a modern word to me.\" Williams instead called it an \"evolution\" away from tennis and towards things that were more important to her at that time.Williams recently posted on social media playing tennis again with her youngest daughter.If Williams was serious about returning to the sport, she would have to be available for testing for at least six months before returning to competition. Given her name was included in an October pool of players, that would mean Williams could return in April 2026, which could give her time to prepare for the French Open in May and Wimbledon in June. She won the French Open three times in her career and Wimbledon an astounding seven times. \nWilliams revolutionized women's tennis when she began her professional career at 14 years old in 1995. Between her and her sister, Venus, the pair became amongst the most famous athletes in the world. Her 23 Grand Slam titles is only bested by Margaret Court who has 24, a record that Williams has expressed interest in breaking in the past.\n            \n    ",

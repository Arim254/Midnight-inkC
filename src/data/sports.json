The U.S. cruised through its preliminary-round games, racking up a 15-1 goal differential across three games, and carried that over in a 6-0 quarterfinal win over Italy. Five different players found the net for the U.S. against the hosts, with Kendall Coyne doing so twice.The U.S. women's curling team, meanwhile, will look to continue its strong showing in round-robin play against Italy. The U.S. is currently second behind Sweden, with the top four teams advancing to the semifinals.\nAlso, medals will go out in the figure skating pair skate, where two U.S. pairs enter the free skate with work to do to get on the podium after Sunday's short program. \n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Milan Cortina Games will run through Sunday, Feb. 22, and in total of 119 events will take place with 245 medals handed out to the athletes.

The SportsLine Projection Model is backing underdogs in college basketball, picking Butler (+2.5) to cover at home against Seton Hall in a 6 p.m. ET tipoff, and Belmont to win outright on the road (-102) in a crucial Missouri Valley Conference matchup against Murray State that also tips at 6 p.m. ET. The over/under for Seton Hall vs. Butler is 139.5, down three from the opening line.Meanwhile, SportsLine NBA expert Larry Hartstein is dialing in on Team World to win the new three-team, round-robin format for the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, which tips off at 5 p.m. ET in the Intuit Dome. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and it enters Week 15 on a sizzling 11-1 run on its top-rated over/under college basketball picks dating back to last season, and is on an 11-5 run on top-rated CBB side picks.

He took over for Kevin Willard four seasons ago and won 17 games in his first year, 25 games in his second year and then seven games in his third year. Now Seton Hall is 17-7 with a 7-7 record and is looking like a fringy NCAA Tournament bubble team. However, the Pirates are only 7-9 against the spread as favorites this season and Butler is 8-6 against the spread at home. The model predicts that the Bulldogs win outright and cover in 72% of simulations. Back Butler to cover at DraftKings here:Belmont money line vs. Murray State (-102)Casey Alexander has managed at least 20 wins in each of his seven seasons as the head coach at Belmont, but he's still chasing his first NCAA Tournament appearance with the Bruins. Belmont is 23-4 overall this season and can give itself a three-game lead in the Missouri Valley Conference with a win over second-place Murray State (19-8, 11-5) on Sunday night. The model predicts that Belmont wins outright in 58% of simulations. Back Belmont at DraftKings here:Team World to win 2026 NBA All-Star Game tournament (+155)\"The new NBA All-Star format, with three teams competing in a round-robin tournament, should create more fan interest and more on-court intensity. I'll back the World team (+160) to prevail over USA Stripes (+155) and USA Stars (+200),\" Hartstein said. \"Any team (with) Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic (who says he will play a 'little bit' on Sunday) and Victor Wembanyama should be the favorite. While Shai-Gilgeous Alexander and Giannis Antetokounpo won't play due to injuries, the World team supplements its big three with big-time performers like Jamal Murray, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Alperen Sengun. Back Team World at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Kansas State fired fourth-year basketball coach Jerome Tang on Sunday, a source told CBS Sports. Athletic director Gene Taylor subsequently revealed late Sunday night he made the decision to fire Tang following K-State's loss at houston on Saturday. The move comes less than four days after Tang's postgame rant went viral following an embarrassing 91-62 home loss to Cincinnati on Thursday. a\"This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men's basketball program,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program's overall direction, have not aligned with K-State's standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.\"  The Wildcats are 10-15 and in the midst of their second-worst season in the past 20-plus years. Kansas State ranks 101st at KenPom.com and is 1-11 in the Big 12. The team is headed toward a second straight sub-.500 season despite being one of the bigger spenders in the transfer portal the past two offseasons. \nKansas State will attempt to fire Tang for cause. Tang has a buyout of more than $18 million, per the terms of his contract, but Taylor believes Tang's public criticisms of the players and the response that press conference spurred in the national media violated the terms of his contract.Tang released a statement disputing Kansas State's assessment of the program.\"I am deeply disappointed with the university's decision and strongly disagree with the characterization of my termination.  I have always acted with integrity and faithfully fulfilled my responsibilities as head coach,\" Tang said. \"I am grateful to the players, staff, and fans who make this program so special. I remain proud of what we built together and confident that I have always acted in the best interests of the university and our student-athletes.\"  Associate head coach Matthew Driscoll has been named interim head coach for the rest of the season. \nLISTEN: Matt Norlander breaks down Tang's final days at K-State on this emergency edition of the Eye on College Basketball podcast.Tang went 71-57 in less than four seasons on the job, including a 29-39 mark in the Big 12. He was hired in 2022 and an immediate success: He guided the Wildcats to the Elite Eight with a No. 3 seed and finished 26-10 thanks to the dynamic duo of point guard Markquis Nowell and forward Keyontae Johnson. Nowell's 19 assists in a Sweet 16 victory vs. Michigan State at Madison Square Garden set both an NCAA Tournament record and an optimistic tone for the Tang era, but it's been a litany of letdowns ever since.K-State is coming off a 78-64 loss at No. 3 Houston on Saturday. Tang had the players' names removed from the back of their jerseys for that game in a questionable move that followed his criticism of KSU players following the Wildcats' loss to the Bearcats.  \n\"This was embarrassing,\" Tang said Wednesday night at his press conference. \"These dudes do not deserve to wear this uniform. There will be very few of them in it next year. I'm embarrassed for the university, I'm embarrassed for our fans, our student section. It is just ridiculous.\"That's the quote that has Tang's legal team and Kansas State's lawyers set to battle in the weeks ahead. If K-State wins, it won't pay Tang another dime. If it loses, Tang will have more than $18.5 million coming his way. There is also the realistic possibility that the parties wind up settling somewhere in the wide gulf between those two numbers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    GoPowerCat's team of Kansas State insiders are providing on-the-ground updates on every development and insider scoop surrounding the Wildcats.

    "body": "\n        The 24-hour window to appeal the results of the 2026 Winter Olympics ice dance competition passed, and United States Figure Skating did not appeal the controversial ruling that led to a silver-medal finish for Team USA pair Madison Chock and Evan Bates. A USFS official said to USA Today that the association did not file an inquiry by the Feb. 12 deadline.Chock and Bates finished a mere 0.43 points behind the French team of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron in the ice dance event, and the judges' scores drew public scrutiny. The American pair trailed narrowly after the rhythm dance portion of the competition, and while five of nine judges awarded them a higher score than the French duo in the free dance, they still came up less than a point short. French judge Jezabel Dabouis gave the French team a score more than seven points higher than Chock and Bates.\"There has been a lot of thoughtful, and at times emotional, discussion about the ice dance competition in Milan,\" USFS CEO Matt Farrell said to USA Today. \"Working together with Madi and Evan after the Games, we will have thoughtful and intentional discussions about the best way to support them and the future of the sport. For now, we plan to join them in supporting the success of U.S. Figure Skating in Milan.\"Dabouis gave Chock and Bates a 129.74-point score for their ice dance routine. She awarded Beaudry and Cizeron 137.45 points. The difference between those marks was the largest of any judge, and the score given to the Americans was the lowest of the judges.\nThat scoring decision raised eyebrows and sparked concerns that Dabouis unfairly favored her home country's team. But the International Skating Union issued a statement defending the judges' decisions.\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,\" the ISU said, per the Associated Press, adding it has \"full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.\"Chock and Bates earned their first Olympic ice dance medal but were favored to win gold, especially considering they entered the free dance in lockstep with the leaders. They won a gold medal in the team event earlier in the Games. Chock expressed disappointment with the controversial scoring decision that stood between him and a third career Olympic gold medal.\n\"I think it would definitely be helpful if it's more understandable for the viewers to see more transparent judging and understand what's really going on,\" Chock said in an interview with CBS News. \"It's also important for the skaters that the judges be vetted and reviewed and that they are also putting out their best performance. There's a lot on the line for the skaters when they're out there giving it their all. We also deserve to have the judges giving it their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field.\"\n            ",

The league has tried to drum up some more interest from fans and players alike to create a more intriguing event. Last year, that plan fell flat with a mini tournament that featured three All-Star teams and one Rising Stars team. This year, the league is still holding the mini tournament but will move to a USA vs. World format. The league wants to highlight the growing international talent, so we'll see Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and more compete against LeBron James, Kevin Durant and other top American talent. The rosters have already been set, so let's dig into some more details about the new format.\nHow to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockNBA All-Star Game format, explainedThe 25 All-Stars have been divided into three teams (Team World has nine players). There will be two U.S. teams (USA Stars and USA Stripes) and one World team. Detroit Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff will coach USA Stars, while San Antonio Spurs coach Mitch Johnson will lead USA Stripes. Toronto Raptors coach Darko Rajaković will coach Team World.There will be a round-robin tournament of four, 12-minute games. USA Stars and Team World will face off in Game 1. The winner of that game will play USA Stripes in Game 2. The losing team of Game 1 will then play USA Stripes in Game 3. Following the three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 with the chance to be crowned champions of All-Star Weekend.If all three teams have a 1-1 record after the first three games, the point differential from the round-robin games will be used to determine the two teams that advance to the championship game.The All-Star Game has a $1.8 million prize pool. Each player on the championship-winning team gets $125,000.

Auston Matthews' three-point game powered the Americans to victory as they turn their attention to the quarterfinal.Through the first two games, Matthews had drawn criticism for not being at his best. That went out the window on Sunday as Matthews was the best player on the ice for the United States. Matthews really kickstarted the play that got Team USA on the board late in the first period when he retrieved a loose puck in the offensive zone and found defenseman Zach Werenski gliding down the weak side.\nFrom there, Matthews made his presence felt in the offensive zone by getting to the front of the net, scoring both of his goals from in or around the crease. One was a power play goal that deflected in off Matthews' stick, and the other was the redirection of a Jake Sanderson slap pass.The Tkachuk brothers were everywhere, which has become a staple of the American play in this competition. Brady was a physical force and notched an assist on a goal by Brock Faber, and Matthew picked up two more assists as he continues to be at the center of the action offensively.Connor Hellebuyck wasn't tested a lot in goal, but he was very good when called upon. The only shot that got past Hellebuyck came off the stick of Tim Stützle, one of the Germans' two best offensive players.The United States made the preliminary round harder than it needed to be, but the team played its best game of the tournament on Sunday. The Americans will try to carry that momentum into the quarterfinals, where they'll play the winner of Sweden vs. Latvia.\nU.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3Sunday, Feb. 15: USA 5, Germany 1QuarterfinalUSA vs. Sweden/Latvia | Wednesday, Feb. 18 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 20 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Saturday, Feb. 21 | 2:10 p.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        PEORIA, Ariz. —Nick Castellanos has no regrets about how his time in Philadelphia ended. The newly acquired Padre, signed after his release from the Phillies earlier this week, said he took lessons from the rocky finish.But regret? There's none of that. \"In the moment, I felt how I felt, and I spoke from the heart, and I was honest in every word that I said,\" Castellanos said early Sunday afternoon from the Peoria Sports Complex, San Diego's spring training facility. \"It's not like I was outwardly ever displaying that. I kept it all inside. But when I was asked a question, I shot straight, and then people perceived it how they wanted.\" Perception always trailed Castellanos in Philly, making him a polarizing figure across his four seasons with the Phillies. But the dugout incident in June, reported by The Athletic, when he brought a beer into the dugout and screamed at manager Rob Thomson and hitting coach Kevin Long, didn't earn him much support.That, Castellanos admitted, he wished he handled differently.\"I said I will learn from this,\" Castellanos said. I let the emotions get the best of me in the moment. [Going forward] possibly if I see things that frustrate me or I don't believe are conducive to winning. [It's about ] not letting things just pile up over time so when I address it, it's less emotional.\" \nCastellanos joins an emotional clubhouse. Manny Machado, a friend from their childhood days, is viewed as the leader of the club. Some around the game see that fact as part of the reason why San DIego has yet to reach its potential. Whether Castellanos will only add fuel to what is already a combustible clubhouse will be something to monitor this season.Nonetheless, after vetting Castellanos' sour ending in Philly, A.J. Preller, the Padres' president of baseball operations, decided to take a chance on the veteran. \"We did a lot of homework,\" Preller said. \"Throughout the whole offseason, there was a lot of talk that the Phillies were looking to move him. We talked to a ton of people that have history with Nick. Teammates, coaches, people who have been around him.\" \nSan Diego made Castellanos' role clear, indicating he will DH and play some outfield and possibly first base, a position he has never played in his big league career. With the Padres' outfield set by Fernando Tatis Jr. in right, the position Castellanos is most accustomed to, his playing time in the field could be limited. Still, San Diego is paying only the league minimum of his $20 million salary in hopes he can rediscover the bat that eluded him at times with his former club.Machado is confident that Castellanos will produce. \"For me as a player, seeing it from this side of it, I see a guy who's accomplished a lot,\" added Machado. \"I really don't know the details of what happened over there. Don't really care, honestly. I'm just happy we got him for what we got him for, and he's going to improve our team tremendously.\" San Diego is in an unusual position. The club is in the middle of a sale, and its finances have been reshaped by the collapse of its regional sports network model. Preller, known for handing out hefty deals, was uncharacteristically quiet this offseason with the future of ownership in flux. On the field, you could argue the Padres might have missed their window to win a World Series. Machado will turn 34 in July. Xander Bogaerts turned 33 in October. After presuming that San Diego would be Fernando Tatis' longterm home, a trade down the line isn't out of the question. \nTheir rotation this year, too, leaves a lot to be desired headlined by Nick Pivetta, Michael King, and Joe Musgrove. Spring training will determine the final two spots. Castellanos, however, has his sights set on this season. He spoke about needing a fresh start and how he sensed Game 4 of the NLDS would likely be his last game as a Phillie. He long came to terms with that and with some of the decisions he made during the year.He wants to contribute. He believes he can still do so -- even as he enters his age-34 season coming off of a down one (.250/.294/.400 slash line in 547 at-bats).\nHe does have just one regret overall about his previous stop, though. \"That we didn't win a World Series,\" he said. \"I think winning solves everything. So I think the one thing that I wish would have ended up different is that we would have won.\" He'll now try to change that outcome in San Diego.\n            ",

San Francisco 49ers run game coordinator and tight ends coach Brian Fleury is headed to the Super Bowl champions to lead Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the rest of the Seattle offense, per NFL Media.The Seahawks lost Kubiak to the Las Vegas Raiders' coach opening, but they didn't go far to find his replacement -- either in terms of distance or approach. Fleury has been coaching in the NFL since 2013 and with the 49ers since 2019, rising in San Francisco from quality control coach to tight ends coach to run game coordinator and tight ends coach. He overlapped with Kubiak, who spent 2023 as the 49ers' pass game coordinator.Though it will be Fleury's first time calling plays, he'll likely bring over several of the elements that the Kyle Shanahan/Klint Kubiak offenses share, including heavy use of under center formations and play action. As run game coordinator and tight ends coach, Fleury worked with Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and others in San Francisco. McCaffrey had 2,126 yards from scrimmage in 2025, his only season with Fleury as the run game coordinator.The news of Fleury's hiring coincided with ESPN's Adam Schefter reporting the Raiders have hired Seahawks quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko as their offensive coordinator. Janocko was with Kubiak in Seattle and, before that, with the New Orleans Saints.\nThe Seahawks finished third in scoring offense and eighth in total offense in 2025, Kubiak's lone season in Seattle. Mike Macdonald will now hope he's nailed another offensive coordinator hire.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA All-Star Game is officially back. After years of embarrassing efforts, even by exhibition game standards, the players finally delivered a showcase that they, and the league, can be proud of -- even if the championship game of the new Team USA vs. Team World format was a bit of a dud. The USA Stars, the younger roster of American All-Stars, destroyed Team Stripes, to more veteran American group, 47-21, in the championship to lift the trophy after a thrilling round-robin series. Anthony Edwards, who poured in 32 points across Team Stars' three games, was named MVP, becoming the first Minnesota Timberwolves player to earn the honor since Kevin Garnett in 2003. After a fun night of action inside the Intuit Dome, here's a look at the winners and losers from the 2026 All-Star Game. Winner: Victor WembanyamaIn the lead up to Sunday's showcase, the French phenom made it clear that he was not happy with what the event had turned into in recent years, and was going to do his best to change it. \n\"I want to push the great players of this sport to play in the All-Star game just as hard as I will,\" Wembanyama said in January. \"We'll see how it goes, but if they don't play hard, I'll do it without them.\"He expanded on those thoughts on Saturday. \"Exclamation-point plays, playing in a solid manner and sharing the ball with energy,\" Wembanyama said, when asked how he planned to set a competitive tone. \"If you share that energy, people feel like they have a responsibility to share it back to you.\"\nWembanyama walked the walk right from the opening tip of the first game. Within the first two minutes, he threw down a huge slam, scored the first seven points for Team World and swatted a Jalen Duren attempt into the crowd. When Team World lost the opener in overtime because of a bad defensive rotation, he threw his hands up and stormed off the court like he had just lost a playoff game. \nEveryone else followed suit. \"I ain't gonna lie, Wemby set the tone,\" Anthony Edwards said. \"He came out and played hard, so it's hard not to match that.\" Winner: The NBABetween all of the tanking discourse, some of Adam Silver's comments during his Saturday press conference and a disastrous All-Star Saturday Night, the league was facing more public criticism than it had in a long time. As an entity, the last thing the NBA needed was another lifeless All-Star Game. Instead, the players delivered the most memorable mid-season showcase since 2020, and one of the most competitive events ever. \nThe first three games of the round robin format were awesome and all went down to the wire. Team Stars defeated Team World in overtime of Game 1 on a game-ending 3-pointer by Scottie BarnesTeam Stripes defeated Team Stars in Game 2 on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by De'Aaron FoxTeam Stripes defeated Team World in Game 3 on a last-second 3-pointer by Kawhi LeonardThe championship turned into a rout, as the much younger Team Stars cruised past the veteran-filled Team Stripes, who seemed to be out of gas. The last few minutes of that contest looked a lot like the previous All-Star Games. But even though the night ended on a low, the overall product was much better than anyone expected, and spared the league another wave of criticism. Loser: The championship gameAs mentioned, the new All-Star Game format pitting the best American players against the best international players was working to perfection through the round robin format, thanks to a big assist from Wembanyama. \nThe two American squads, Team Stars and Team Stripes, advanced to the championship, and everything was set up for a thrilling conclusion to the best All-Star Game in years. So, of course, we got a blowout. The younger Team Stars had way more juice left in their legs, and they jumped out to an early double-digit lead. Team Stripes briefly gave itself some hope with back-to-back 3s from LeBron James and Jalen Brunson to cut the deficit down to nine with seven minutes to play, but never got closer. While the night was an overall success, the way it ended was definitely a bummer. \nWinner: Kawhi LeonardLeonard has had a strange six months. During the offseason, Leonard was the subject of an investigative report by Pablo Torre that alleged the Clippers star had received $28 million via a fradulent marketing agreement that allowed his team to circumvent the salary cap. The NBA's investigation into the matter has not yet concluded. Shortly after the season got underway, Leonard was forced to the sidelines for nearly three weeks with ankle and foot sprains. The Clippers went 2-8 without him, part of a disastrous start to the season for the team, which was expecting to get back to the playoffs. A few days before Christmas, Leonard began one of the best stretches of his career, which included three 40-point outings in the span of five games, including a career-high 55 points in a win over the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons. The hot streak kicked off a stunning turnaround for the Clippers, who went from 6-21 to 26-28 in the span of two months to climb into Play-In Tournament position in the Western Conference. \nDespite an incredible last few weeks, Leonard wasn't initially named to the game, but eventually made it as an injury replacement. He proved to be a wise pick by Silver, and put on an incredible show in front of the Clippers fans on Sunday, as he helped Team Stripes reach the championship game. In Game 3 of the round-robin format, Leonard poured in 31 of Team Stripes' 48 points on 11-of-13 shooting from the field, including a 6-of-7 effort from 3-point range, and hit a game-winning triple over Karl-Anthony Towns (more on that later) in the closing seconds. Leonard's 12-minute bonanza was one of the best parts of the night, and was yet another reminder that when he's healthy, there are few better players in the world. \n\"It was great. Happy that Adam [Silver] let me in. That's what the home crowd wanted to see. I'm glad I was able to do something in that game,\" Leonard said. \nWinner: Anthony EdwardsEarlier this weekend, Edwards was blunt when asked for his thoughts on the state of the All-Star Game (\"It is what it is at this point\") and whether the new format would make a difference (\"No\"). But by the end of the first game, Edwards had changed his tune. \"I ain't gonna lie, Wemby set the tone,\" Edwards said. \"He came out and played hard, so it's hard not to match that.\" Edwards can at times appear aloof and \"too cool for school\" during press conferences, but on the court he's one of the league's most fierce competitors. It's unlikely that he went into Sunday night with a plan to play hard, but once Wembanyama had laid down a marker, he couldn't help but respond. \n\"Yeah, [Wembanyama] set the tone, man, and it woke me up, for sure,\" Edwards added after the game. Edwards had 13 points in Game 1, 11 points in Game 2 and eight points in the championship, for a total of 32 on the night, and was named All-Star MVP for his efforts. \nLoser: Karl-Anthony TownsTowns spends all season hearing about his defensive deficiencies, and how they might prevent the New York Knicks from winning a championship. All-Star Weekend is supposed to be a respite from that sort of talk, but somehow Towns found himself on the receiving end of even more criticism. \nGame 1 between Team World and Team Stars went to overtime, and instead of putting any time on the clock, a winning score of five points was set. Team World was up 3-2, and should have been playing a no-3s defense, but Towns for some reason rotated into the paint to try and stop Jalen Duren, which left Scottie Barnes wide open from behind the arc. Duren found Barnes for the game-winning shot. \nIn Game 3 between Team World and Team Stripes, the score was tied in the closing seconds when Towns got switched onto Leonard. Towns actually played pretty good defense, but Leonard drained a game-winning 3 right in his face. \nPoor Towns. The first time anyone has been expected to show any sort of effort on that end of the floor in the All-Star Game and he immediately finds himself on a defensive lowlight reel.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA All-Star Game has arrived at the Clippers' Intuit Dome in Los Angeles. The game, featuring a brand-new USA vs. World format, is being held Sunday afternoon. The All-Star Game rosters were finalized earlier this week with all injury replacements being named and some of the teams shuffled around. The USA vs. World format features three teams in a round-robin tournament. Twenty-eight players in total were named All-Stars this season as Spurs guard De'Aaron Fox joined the ranks Thursday. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, GiannisThe format will consist of a mini-tournament, where each team plays each other once to determine who will face off in a title game. There will be a USA Stars team and a USA Stripes team to split up the American talent, while Team World will have all the international NBA talent.Some liberties were taken in dividing up the roster to even up the numbers. For instance, Karl-Anthony Towns, who was born in New Jersey but has played for the Dominican Republic national team, will be on Team World, although he also could've been placed on one of the two USA teams. The same goes for Norman Powell, who was slid over to Team World to replace the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo after first being placed on USA Stripes. Powell, born in San Diego, has played for the Jamaican national team. \nAs far as the schedule goes, USA Stars -- made up of the younger American All-Stars like Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham and Tyrese Maxey -- and Team World will face Team World in Game 1. The winner of that matchup will face USA Stripes -- made up of American vets like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard -- in Game 2. The loser of Game 1 will then also play USA Stripes in Game 3. At the end of the first three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 to determine the champions. If there is a three-way tie, point differential will be used to determine the two teams that will advance.Here are the rosters for all three teams:2026 NBA All-Star Game rostersUSA Stars USA StripesTeam WorldScottie BarnesJaylen BrownGiannis Antetokounmpo (injured)Devin BookerJalen BrunsonDeni AvdijaCade CunninghamStephen Curry (injured)Luka DončićJalen DurenKevin DurantShai Gilgeous-Alexander (injured)Anthony EdwardsBrandon Ingram (injury replacement)Nikola JokićChet HolmgrenLeBron JamesJamal MurrayJalen JohnsonKawhi LeonardAlperen Sengun (injury replacement)Tyrese MaxeyDonovan MitchellPascal SiakamDe'Aaron Fox (injury replacement)Karl-Anthony TownsVictor WembanyamaNorman PowellThe 2026 All-Star game tips off at 5 p.m. EST on NBC and Peacock. The players on the winning team will each walk away with $125,000. Players on the second-place team get $50,000, while players of the third-placed team get $25,000.\nJ.B. Bickerstaff of the Pistons is coaching the USA Stars team, which has two of his Detroit players in Jalen Duren and Cade Cunningham. Mitch Johnson of the Spurs will coach the USA Stripes team, and Team World will be led by Serbian-born Darko Rajaković of the Raptors.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Now at the peak of his career, Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown should have ample time remaining in the NBA. Still, the five-time All-Star is already contemplating plans for after his eventual retirement from basketball, though, and his next venture could be in combat sports. Brown said he has even had discussions with UFC CEO Dana White, which could help get the ball rolling on his transition from the hardwood to the Octagon.Brown took up martial arts two years ago and has implemented Muay Thai into his basketball training ever since. He said it improved his physical and mental abilities on the court. Perhaps it could lead to a combat career down the road.\"I've toyed with this,\" Brown said at NBA All-Star media day. \"I've talked to some people. Maybe the post part of my career, I would love to partake in something like UFC or even boxing. I've talked to Dana White about some stuff. But we'll see as things go on. We'll see.\"Since basketball is a contact sport, Brown's worlds often collide on the hardwood. Whether it be his physical play between the whistles or his involvement in scuffles from time to time, the Celtics' leading scorer sees regular opportunities to put his martial arts training into practice.\n\"It's kind of exciting when you get in the moment to have a little bit of controversy,\" Brown said. \"Sometimes it's not even that big of a deal, but we've got emotional dudes, we've got passionate dudes about this game. Some of that stuff is going to happen. You get in between the margins, you're throwing 'bows. That stuff, that's a part of the game to some degree.\"If he ever moves fully from basketball to combat sports, it could be a while before Brown makes that switch. He is in his Celtics prime and has flourished this season as the centerpiece of a Boston team that stands at No. 2 in the Eastern Conference at the All-Star break. Brown averages a career-best 29.3 points per game and is on pace to set personal highs in rebounds (6.9) and assists (4.7). He leads the league in field goals attempted and made per game in his newly expanded role.\nBrown's breakthrough as one of the NBA's most productive players is largely a result of the Celtics playing without Jayson Tatum, who tore his Achilles last postseason and could sit out the entire 2025-26 campaign.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- It was a tactical gambit only brought about by an injury in the warm-up. It was one that Mikel Arteta had had more than six years to play about with, something he had only done fleetingly. And it was the first look that he moved on from with a halftime substitution.Basically, Bukayo Saka's dalliance with central midfield in this 4-0 shellacking of Wigan Athletic is probably just going to be one of those curios that is left to gather dust in the vault. Mikel Arteta's electric Nebraska, if you will. And maybe the boss has good reason not to indulge the wishes of his fanbase. Simplicity is so often the greatest conduit towards creativity. If your songs sound best with guitar and harmonica, play them that way. If you have one of the best right wingers on the planet, play him there.Then again, maybe there's something in this that merits a second hearing? After all, Arteta said as much after the game. \"That's something that's a possibility, and I wanted to try it, and we might use it in the future. We still have so many games, competitions and different scenarios to play in this season, and that's a possibility that we have,\" Arteta said.\nWhen Riccardo Calafiori limped out with injury, there could have been a like-for-like swap with Piero Hincapie. Myles Lewis-Skelly ultimately swapped out of his midfield berth for left back, but it could have been Martin Zubimendi or Declan Rice who brought experience to the engine room. Given that Martin Odegaard joined Kai Havertz and Mikel Merino on the sidelines, someone is going to have to step into midfield. Why not a player who seemed to offer his side some of what they have missing, albeit against very limited opposition?Arsenal's attack has occasionally drifted out of tune this season, very proficient individual players not always synchronizing as they might. Saka is not excluded from that assessment given he has seven goals and five assists in 33 games across all competitions, a tally he failed to add to on Sunday, even as he forced an own goal for the Gunners' third. A fair chunk of that underperformance can be credited to Saka being behind his expected goals and assists, not a fact you would necessarily expect to be quite so true a few months from now. Then again Saka is not quite delivering the same xG and shot output he had at the peak of his threat two years ago. Anything that might get their best attacker into the most dangerous positions more frequently is surely worth an extended play.\n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Arsenal have tried this before, Saka getting a sniff at central midfield in the drudgery of lockdown ball, late in the 2019-20 season and early in the weeks that follow. He is a different player now, however, and Arsenal are a different team.You could see Saka bringing back some of the qualities that this team has occasionally lacked in its worst attacking moments. His movement for the third immediately had one harking back to 2022-23 and Granit Xhaka: byline crasher. With the flying Noni Madueke drawing the attention of his defense, there was a seam for the central midfielder to attack. A first time cross before the ball went out of play should have been turned in by Gabriel Jesus, who instead miscued the ball into the path of the unfortunate Jack Hunt.first-timeThat the cross came off his weaker foot speaks to the great quality he could deliver centrally, his two-footedness making him into even more of a double threat than he is off the right flank. With a bit more space to operate on the outside, Saka could blow by his opponents on the outside to get to a crossing spot or manufacture a shooting chance, too. As is apparent in the progressive flow graphic below, an awful lot of Arsenal's forward momentum came in the inside right channel Saka occupied for the first 45 minutes, after which Viktor Gyokeres took his place.\n\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            \"He's more central, he's closer to the goal,\" said Arteta. \"It's a bit more difficult for the opponent to get his reference constantly. He can interchange position with the wide player as well, and he's so good at picking those spaces, and when he's there, he can really hurt you with the ball.\"On a broader level, Arsenal found themselves with a midfield that was just that bit more intent on stretching play beyond the opposition defense. One of the few critiques you could throw at the Zubimendi, Rice and Odegaard triumvirate is that all three are so adept with the ball at their feet that they tend to gravitate towards it. Saka was more intent on attacking space. With Gabriel Jesus dropping off as Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli drove on, there were options for the deep passers. The outstanding Eberechi Eze exploited those with aplomb.\"I was a bit surprised with the level of cohesion and connections very early in the match,\" said a candid Arteta. \"When you make that many changes, that can be a part of the game that can be lacking, but certainly it wasn't, and we scored some very, very good goals.\"\nAll of this comes with the most almighty of caveats. Sunday's opposition were, ermmm, not very good. When Madueke cooly rolled in the opener, the travelling Wigan support serenaded their hosts with a chant of \"How shit must you be, it's only 1-0.\" Three goals later they struck up a similar tune. When they've seen give up six to Peterborough United last week, there was little to really fear from the Emirates Stadium. Arteta could have played Saka at center back and given Tommy Setford his home debut at the tip of the attack. Arsenal were still going to win.As such Saka's shift infield might be a one and done, a short sharp burst rather than a change of direction. But when Arsenal find the rhythm that so impressed their manager from the off today, you do want to hear a little bit more.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LeBron James is an All Star for a record-extending 22nd consecutive season. Whether or not it's his final one remains TBD. Speaking ahead of Sunday night's All-Star Game, the Los Angeles Lakers superstar remained mum on his basketball-playing future.\"When I know, you guys will know,\" James said about how he's feeling about playing next season. \"I don't know. I have no idea.\"James, 41, is in the final year of a two-year, $104 million deal, the fourth deal he has signed with the Lakers. He's averaging 22.0 points, 7.1 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game this season, with the scoring average on pace to be his lowest since his rookie season (2003-04) when he was still a teenager.James has already missed 18 games this season due to a variety of ailments, meaning he will not be eligible for All-NBA team selection -- there's a 65-game minimum -- which means his 21-year All-NBA streak will end. Still, he has shown moments of dominance, including a triple-double in the Lakers' 124-104 win over the Dallas Mavericks to send the team into the All-Star break.\nIt ended an eventful pre-break stretch for James, who also missed a game with left foot arthritis and, before that, shared a blunt assessment of his team.\"You want me to compare us to them? That's a championship team right there. We're not,\" James told reporters after Monday night's loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. \"We can't sustain energy and effort for 48 minutes, and they can. That's why they won a championship.\"The Lakers (33-21) are fifth in the Western Conference. On one hand, they have a point differential that suggests they should be closer to .500. On the other hand, they've rarely been fully healthy. Luka Dončić has missed 12 games, Austin Reaves has missed 26, and Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart have both missed 10. James acknowledged the health factor Sunday.\n\"It's too hard to really say what we're capable of,\" James said about the team's prospects following the All-Star break. \"I know that we've played some of our best basketball this season, we've looked very good. On the other side, we've been terrible. We've looked disgusting. I think the most important [thing] is if we can get healthy, how many minutes we can be on the floor, how much chemistry with can build with this sprint starting.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA's annual All-Star Weekend concludes Sunday evening, and this year the league's top players have convened in Los Angeles. This is the seventh time that the annual showcase has been in the City of Angels, but the first time that the Clippers will be the sole hosts.All of the action is taking place at the new Intuit Dome, which opened last season. The Clippers' arena, which cost $2 billion, has drawn rave reviews from fans and players alike, and will become the center of the basketball world for three days. Damian Lillard and Keshad Johnson were the big winners on All-Star Saturday. The Trail Blazers legend won his third career 3-point contest despite not playing this season as he recovers from a torn Achilles. Johnson, meanwhile, put his name on the radar by dunking and dancing his way to the Dunk Contest trophy.Bet NBA All-Star Weekend at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Sunday evening brings the All-Star Game, and the format has been tweaked once again. This time, it's Team USA vs. Team USA vs. Team World. The All-Star selections have been separated into three teams and will compete in a round-robin tournament. The league hopes that pitting Americans against international players will generate a more competitive environment, but we'll have to wait to see if that makes a difference. \nHere's how to watch Sunday's NBA All-Star Game, which is tipping off in the middle of the afternoon in L.A.How to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockAhead of this weekend's festivities, CBS Sports' panel of experts made their picks for All-Star Game and All-Star Game MVP.

You'll remember him getting ticked off at Anthony Edwards in the skills competition when Ant decided to shoot left handed for the lols. \nHerbert: The theme here is that I think the guys I picked will take this stuff seriously. For the All-Star \"Game,\" I just picked the team that I thought would try the hardest. (I was tempted to take Team World, but, historically, Nikola Jokić and Luka Dončić have not expended much energy on this stage.) I can see Cunningham and Jalen Duren setting a competitive tone, especially with J.B. Bickerstaff coaching them. Maloney: I'm going with Team World to win the All-Star Game and Victor Wembanyama to take home MVP. Even with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sidelined due to injury, Team World is the most talented bunch, and Wembanyama has made it abundantly clear that he's taking this more seriously than everyone else. Salerno: If you watched the movie \"Hustle,\" you know Kermit Wilts, AKA Anthony Edwards, loves competition. In this kind of format/showcase, guards tend to dominate. I'm going with Edwards, -- and, by extension, the USA Stars team -- to have a night to remember in Southern California. The new format hopefully will inject new life into the ASG. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Zuffa Boxing returns on Sunday with Zuffa Boxing 03 from the Meta APEX in Las Vegas. The event is headlined by a clash between Efe Ajagba and former IBF heavyweight champion Charles Martin.Ajagba is on the verge of being a top 10 heavyweight in the world and likely would already be considered as such had things broken better for him on the scorecards in his most recent fight. That night, Ajagba took on Martin Bakole, seen as one of heavyweight's boogeymen, avoided by most in the division for the difficulties he can present to opponents.Ajagba controlled much of that fight in May 2025, but the scorecards resulted in a majority draw, with one judge scoring the fight 96-94 in Ajagba's favor and the other two ruling the fight a 95-95 draw.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 03 live on Sunday night for no additional fee. Plus, every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nAjagba was rewarded for his performance against Bakole with a proposed IBF title eliminator against Frank Sanchez, who handed Ajagba his lone defeat in a 2021 meeting. Ajagba was unhappy with how the purse bid for the fight shook out and declined to move forward with the bout, ultimately leading to the termination of his contract with Top Rank, which opened the door for the heavyweight contender to sign with Zuffa Boxing.While Martin does hold the distinction of being a former world heavyweight champion, the circumstances of his title reign are unusual.Martin won the IBF title in a 2016 bout with Vyacheslav Glazkov that saw Glazkov unable to continue due to a knee injury suffered during a third-round knockdown. Less than 90 days later, Martin was no longer champion, suffering a second-round knockout to Anthony Joshua.\nMartin has insisted he was \"badly injured\" 10 days before the Joshua fight and continued to chase a rematch for years, rising to the fringes of title contention with a few wins before suffering repeated setbacks in the form of losses to Adam Kownacki, Luis Ortiz and Jared Anderson.After losing to Anderson in July 2023, Martin got back in the win column with a stoppage of unheralded Matthew McKinney the following November. He has not fought since, marking 15 months out of the ring.The light heavyweight co-main event between Umar Dzambekov and Ahmed Elbiali appears to be the standout fight on the card, with unbeaten Dzambekov looking to continue building his resume against a tough out in Elbiali, whose lone loss came to former world champion Jean Pascal.\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of the fight card for Sunday night with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Zuffa Boxing 03 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookEfe Ajagba -1100 vs. Charles Martin +650, heavyweightsUmar Dzambekov-1400 vs. Ahmed Elbiali +700, light heavyweightsAbel Mejia -800 vs. Jaybrio Pe Benito +500, lightweightsLeonardo Ruiz -1400 vs. Casey Streeter +700, middleweightsAntonio Woods -425 vs. Mark Beuke +300, middleweightsOswaldo Molina -1200 vs. Joshua Clark +650, lightweightsEmiliano Alvarado -2500 vs. Devin Gantt +1000, junior featherweightDariial Kuchmenov -3000 vs. Jorge Lagunas +1000, lightweightsWhere to watch Zuffa Boxing 03Date: Feb. 15 | Location: Meta APEX -- Las VegasPrelims begin at 6 p.m. ETMain card begins at 9 p.m. ETWatch live: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionAs a 31-year-old on a six-fight unbeaten streak who was being lined up for a title eliminator, Ajagba is very much a contender at heavyweight. Martin started his career 23-0 and won a world title, but has fallen very much into a spot as a gatekeeper for the division. That's not a knock because divisions benefit from gatekeepers; they're good enough to fend off pretenders, and a win against them carries actual meaning.\nAjagba came up short against Frank Sanchez, which does raise some questions about whether he is ready to fully break through to the upper echelon of heavyweights and if he isn't, Martin is talented enough to knock him down the ladder. But Ajagba's performance against Bakole showed he can handle big, awkward heavyweights who carry some power in their fists.This is a fight set up to get Ajagba a win over a former champion and he should be able to do just that.

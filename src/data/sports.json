    "body": "\nThe first opportunity to make a Week 15 NFL SGP comes when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers host the Atlanta Falcons on 'Thursday Night Football.' Making NFL picks on the money line could be of interest for some with their TNF SGP, but perhaps there are better options. Not only have these teams split their last 20 meetings, but their all-time series is also evenly split with 32 wins apiece. Thus, your 'Thursday Night Football' same-game parlay may want to rely on NFL player props, spread bets and total predictions.The Over has hit in four of the last five Atlanta games, while it's also hit in three of the last five Tampa games. If interested in prop bets for your NFL same-game parlay, then there are intriguing ones for the likes of Bijan Robinson, Baker Mayfield, Bucky Irving and Mike Evans, who is active but is expected to be on a snap count. Before locking in any Falcons vs. Buccaneers picks for your 'Thursday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the Buccaneers vs. Falcons prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Bucky Irving going over 61.5 rushing yards. Bet it at DraftKings right here:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Buccaneers vs. Falcons on 'Thursday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of almost 7-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Atlanta vs. Tampa Bay here.\nTop 'Thursday Night Football' SGP picksAfter simulating Buccaneers vs. Falcons, SportsLine's Machine Learning Model says Falcons RB Bijan Robinson goes Under 4.5 receptions (+112). Robinson has gone under his receptions bar in four of his last five games, averaging 3.0 receptions over this span. While he's averaging a career high in receptions per game this year, much of that was when Michael Penix Jr. was under center as Robinson has had three or fewer catches in five of the last six games started by Kirk Cousins.Additionally, Tampa has contained running backs in the passing game recently. Only one running back has had more than three receptions versus the Bucs over their last seven games, despite facing the likes of Jahmyr Gibbs and Alvin Kamara over that span. The AI model projects Robinson to have 2.8 receptions. This plus-money NFL prop is rated 4.5 stars and could be a part of a winning Thursday Night Football SGP. See which other TNF same-game parlay picks to make here.You can bet Robinson to go under 4.5 receptions at DraftKings:\nHow to make Falcons vs. Buccaneers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has 12 other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your Bucs vs. Falcons SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Thursday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top TNF same-game parlay picks you should target with your Falcons vs. Bucs predictions?

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl season kicks off on Saturday when Boise State battles Washington in the 2025 LA Bowl at 8 p.m. ET. Over the course of the next five weeks, there will be 46 bowl matchups (including all College Football Playoff games) and the college football bowl schedule includes some stylistically intriguing battles. After being snubbed by the College Football Playoff committee, Notre Dame has chosen not to participate in a bowl, but No. 12 BYU, who was also left out, will play No. 22 Georgia Tech in the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Dec. 27. Other matchups that day include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), UConn vs. Army (-5.5) and LSU vs. Houston (-3.5).BYU is a 4.5-point favorite in the latest college football bowl odds, but will they actually show up motivated after it looks like they weren't given serious consideration for the 12-team playoff? Motivation is always a factor during bowl season and it's something that you'll need to consider as you make your college football bowl confidence picks along with opt-outs, transfer portal news, injuries and many more factors. Before entering any college football bowl confidence pools, be sure to see the college football picks from SportsLine's Thomas Casale.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:A frequent guest on national radio and TV shows to discuss college sports, Casale has been sports betting -- and winning -- for more than 30 years.So before filling out your college football pool picks or making any college football bets, you need to see Casale's college football bowl confidence picks.

The Aggies finished 11-1 and 7-1 in the SEC, tying for first place, but missed out on playing in the conference championship after losing at Texas 27-17 on Nov. 28. The Hurricanes, who tied for second with four other teams at 6-2 in the ACC and were 10-2 overall, have won four in a row.Quarterback Marcel Reed helps power the A&M offense. The sophomore has completed 61.8% of his passes for 2,932 yards and 25 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and a 153.2 rating. He has also rushed 89 times for 466 yards (5.2 average) and six touchdowns.

The Bucs have won six of the last 10 meetings against the Falcons, but Tampa Bay is just 1-4 in its past five games overall. Tampa Bay is favored by 4.5 points at home, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has identified Buccaneers (-4.5) as one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook for online sports betting. The model is backing Over 222.5 total points in Rockets vs. Clippers, while one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick from No. 4 Iowa State taking on Iowa in a rivalry college basketball matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Buccaneers are 1-4 over their last five games, however, three of those losses came to teams in the Super Bowl picture, falling to the Rams, Bills and Patriots. Meanwhile, the Falcons (4-9) are 1-7 over their last eight games and are coming off an ugly 37-9 loss to the Seahawks last week. Kirk Cousins is 37 years old as the current Atlanta QB1, and he's clearly not the quarterback he once was. He'll take the field without Drake London (knee) once again. Meanwhile, Baker Mayfield could have reinforcements his way with wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan activated from IR. The model projects Tampa Bay to cover in 51% of simulations. Back Tampa Bay at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers vs. Rockets: Over 222.5 points (-108)Kevin Durant and James Harden, former teammates with two different franchises, go head-to-head on Thursday, with Durant leading the Rockets and Harden spearheading the Clippers. Both teams are having significantly different levels of success this season, but with both teams rested and having not played since Saturday, the model projects these veteran superstars to play significant minutes, which could lead to more scoring for themselves and their teammates. The Rockets are fourth in the league in scoring at 120.9 ppg this season, and the Clippers have allowed at least 107 points in 13 of their last 14 contests. The model projects the Over to hit in 62.9% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Iowa vs. Iowa State: Under 143.5 points (-110)\"It's fair to speculate if the Hawkeyes can really keep pace in \"Hoops Cy-Hawk\" after Iowa lost contact vs. Michigan State last week,\" SportsLine legendary expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The task of slowing ISU's offense (better than 94 ppg and hitting north of 54% from the floor) will likely come down to how well Ben McCollum's offense controls pace and tempo, and preventing the Cyclones from deploying their devastating transition game that helped bury top-ranked Purdue last Saturday. Easier said than done, but even if winning the game might be a real stretch for Iowa, McCollum's team can slow the pace as good as any, and with four starters (including star G Bennett Stirtz) hitting better than 50% from the floor, the Hawkeyes can afford to be patient.\" Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Thursday Night Football, NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

After one fight, however, Hawke realized he wouldn't cut it as a professional fighter. \"I saw 'Rocky' and I decided I wanted to be a boxer,\" Hawke told fellow actor Sydney Sweeney for Variety and CNN's \"Actors on Actors\" series. \"I took boxing lessons. I got one fight, and I didn't like boxing anymore.\"I got my ass kicked. I felt like I was a pretty good  defensive boxer, but the guy was punching my hands so hard that I was  hitting myself. I dropped it. I did not like losing.\" \nHawke fared infinitely better as an actor. His decorated resume includes a Daytime Emmy Award, as well as nominations for four Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, a British Academy Film Award, and a Tony. He came closest to experiencing the boxer lifestyle while portraying an ex-boxer in a 1999 production of Tennessee Williams' experimental play, \"Camino Real.\"Sweeney, who recently played International Boxing Hall of Famer Christy Martin in a biopic, told Hawke she had trained in boxing for roughly six months for the role. \n\"You fared better than I did,\" Hawke told Sweeney, the latter of whom suffered a concussion on set.\n            \n    ",

With conference play on the horizon, the Fighting Irish are looking to the gridiron for depth.Notre Dame coach Micah Shrewsberry announced Thursday that the team is adding freshman Mark Zackery IV to the roster. Zackery just wrapped up his first collegiate football season playing cornerback for Notre Dame, and recorded 10 tackles and two passes defensed in 11 games played. While he chose football, Zackery stood out on the high school basketball circuit as a former Indiana Class 4A state champion and Indiana All-Star. \"I think that Mark will be a great addition to our program,\" Shrewsberry said in a statement. \"I have seen him play many times throughout his high school career. Whether competing with Team Teague, Indiana Elite, or Ben Davis High School, he always does things that help lead to winning. He will be an asset for us with his ball handling, playmaking, and defensive abilities. More importantly, he is a great young man that will add more value to our locker room and culture.\" According to Notre Dame's official website, Zackery won the state championship with Ben Davis High School as a sophomore, and made it back to the title game as a junior during a season in which he averaged 11.0 points, 2.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 1.4 steals per contest. He also played AAU ball with teammates Logan Imes and Braeden Shrewsberry. As a football recruit, Zackery was named Indiana Mr. Football in 2024, and ranked as a four-star prospect by 247Sports.\nThe 8-3 Fighting Irish are coming off a 80-65 win over Idaho on Wednesday. Their next game is against Evansville on Saturday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The SEC released its full 2026 schedule on Thursday night, offering a glimpse into what awaits league members as the conference undergoes a historic shift. With the league moving from an eight-game schedule to a nine-game league slate for next season, there will be a whopping 72 conference matchups.Increasing the number of SEC games will make the season even more of a grind for the teams, especially in an era that can require playing as many as five postseason games. But it's a big win for season-ticket holders and casual fans alike, as there will be more meaningful games than ever before.SEC schools will also be required to play at least one Power Four opponent (or Notre Dame) every year, meaning that, in 2026 and beyond, at least 10 of every SEC team's 12 games will be against Power Four opposition. The moves are just the latest big shifts in the way SEC football scheduling is done in the new College Football Playoff landscape.The 2024 season brought the additions of Oklahoma and Texas from the Big 12 and the eradication of the league's long-established divisional structure. As a result, some games that were once contested annually will now be played just twice in a four-year span.\nThe 2026 schedule for each SEC team can be viewed below. 2026 SEC scheduleAlabamaSept. 5: East CarolinaSept. 12: at KentuckySept. 19: Florida StateSept. 26: South CarolinaOct. 3: at Mississippi StateOct. 10: GeorgiaOct. 17: at TennesseeOct. 24: Texas A&MNov. 7: at LSUNov. 14: at VanderbiltNov. 21: ChattanoogaNov. 28: AuburnArkansasSept. 5: North AlabamaSept. 12: at UtahSept. 19: GeorgiaSept. 26: TulsaOct. 3: at Texas A&MOct. 10: vs. TennesseeOct. 17: at VanderbiltOct. 31: MissouriNov. 7: at AuburnNov. 14: South CarolinaNov. 21: at TexasNov. 28: LSUAuburnSept. 5: Baylor (Atlanta)Sept. 12: Southern MissSept. 19: FloridaSept. 26: VanderbiltOct. 3: at TennesseeOct. 17: at GeorgiaOct. 24: LSUOct. 31: at Ole MissNov. 7: ArkansasNov. 14: at Mississippi StateNov. 21: SamfordNov. 28: at AlabamaFloridaSept. 5: FAUSept. 12: CambellSept. 19: at AuburnSept. 26: Ole MissOct. 3: at MissouriOct. 10: South CarolinaOct. 17: at TexasOct. 31: Georgia (Atlanta)Nov. 7: OklahomaNov. 14: at KentuckyNov. 21: VanderbiltNov. 28: at Florida StateGeorgiaSept. 5: Tennessee StateSept. 12: Western KentuckySept. 19: at ArkansasSept. 26: Oklahoma Oct. 3: VanderbiltOct. 10: at AlabamaOct. 17: AuburnOct. 31: Florida (Atlanta)Nov. 7: at Ole MissNov. 14: MissouriNov. 21: at South CarolinaNov. 28: Georgia TechKentuckySept. 5: Youngstown StateSept. 12: AlabamaSept. 19: at Texas A&MSept. 26: South AlabamaOct. 3: at South CarolinaOct. 10: LSUOct. 17: at OklahomaOct. 24: VanderbiltNov. 7: at TennesseeNov. 14: FloridaNov. 21: at MissouriNov. 28: LouisvilleLSUSept. 5: ClemsonSept. 12: Louisiana TechSept. 19: at Ole MissSept. 26: Texas A&MOct. 3: McNeeseOct. 10: at KentuckyOct. 17: Mississippi StateOct. 24: at AuburnNov. 7: AlabamaNov. 14: TexasNov. 21: at TennesseeNov. 28: at ArkansasOle MissSept. 5: Louisville (Nashville)Sept. 12: CharlotteSept. 19: LSU Sept. 26: at FloridaOct. 10: at VanderbiltOct. 17: MissouriOct. 24: at TexasOct. 31: AuburnNov. 7: GeorgiaNov. 14: at OklahomaNov. 21: WoffordNov. 28: Mississippi StateMississippi StateSept. 5: Louisiana-MonroeSept. 12: at MinnesotaSept. 19: at South CarolinaSept. 26: MissouriOct. 3: AlabamaOct. 17: at LSUOct. 24: OklahomaOct. 31: at TexasNov. 7: VanderbiltNov. 14: AuburnNov. 21: Tennessee TechNov. 28: at Ole MissMissouriSept. 5: Arkansas-Pine BluffSept. 12: at KansasSept. 19: TroySept. 26: at Mississippi StateOct. 3: FloridaOct. 10: Texas A&MOct. 17: at Ole MissOct. 31: at ArkansasNov. 7: TexasNov. 14: at GeorgiaNov. 21: KentuckyNov. 28: OklahomaOklahomaSept. 5: UTEPSept. 12: at MichiganSept. 19: New MexicoSept. 26: at GeorgiaOct. 10: Texas (Dallas)Oct. 17: KentuckyOct. 24: at Mississippi StateOct. 31: South CarolinaNov. 7: at FloridaNov. 14: Ole MissNov. 21: Texas A&MNov. 28: at MissouriSouth CarolinaSept. 5: Kent StateSept. 12: Towson Sept. 19: Mississippi StateSept. 26: at AlabamaOct. 3: Kentucky Oct. 10: at FloridaOct. 24: TennesseeOct. 31: at OklahomaNov. 7: Texas A&MNov. 14: at ArkansasNov. 21: GeorgiaNov. 28: at ClemsonTennesseeSept. 5: FurmanSept. 12: at Georgia TechSept. 19: Kennesaw StateSept. 26: TexasOct. 3: AuburnOct. 10: at ArkansasOct. 17: AlabamaOct. 24: at South CarolinaNov. 7: KentuckyNov. 14: at Texas A&MNov. 21: LSUNov. 28: at VanderbiltTexasSept. 5: Texas StateSept. 12: Ohio StateSept. 19: UTSASept. 26: at TennesseeOct. 10: vs. Oklahoma (Dallas)Oct. 17: FloridaOct. 24: Ole MissOct. 31: Mississippi StateNov. 7: at MissouriNov. 14: at LSUNov. 21: ArkansasNov. 27: at Texas A&MTexas A&MSept. 5: Missouri StateSept. 12: Arizona StateSept. 19: KentuckySept. 26: at LSUOct. 3: ArkansasOct. 10: at MissouriOct. 17: CitadelOct. 24: at AlabamaNov. 7: at South CarolinaNov. 14: TennesseeNov. 21: at OklahomaNov. 27: TexasVanderbiltSept. 5: Austin PeaySept. 12: DelawareSept. 19: NC StateSept. 26: at AuburnOct. 3: at GeorgiaOct. 10: Ole MissOct. 17: ArkansasOct. 24: at KentuckyNov. 7: at Mississippi StateNov. 14: AlabamaNov. 21: at FloridaNov. 28: Tennessee\n            ",

    "body": "\nA stretch during which they lost five of seven games put the Pittsburgh Steelers in danger of falling out of first place in the AFC North. But Mike Tomlin's club withstood a late comeback attempt by the Baltimore Ravens last week to post a 27-22 road victory and remain atop the division. The Steelers attempt to strengthen their hold on first place in Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season when they host the streaking Miami Dolphins at Acrisure Stadium on Monday Night Football.It appeared as if Pittsburgh (7-6) would run away and capture its first division title since 2020 as it won four of its first five games and owned a 2 1/2-game lead after Week 6. That advantage was aided by a 2-4 start by the Cincinnati Bengals, who lost quarterback Joe Burrow for more than two months to a toe injury in Week 2, and 1-5 beginnings by both the Ravens and Cleveland Browns.However, the Steelers won only two of their following six contests, while Baltimore reeled off five consecutive victories to pull even with Pittsburgh in the standings at 6-5. The teams remained tied as both lost in Week 13, and the Steelers owned an 11-point lead after three quarters in their showdown last Sunday and held on for the win to move one game ahead of the Ravens with four remaining.\nWideout DK Metcalf had his best performance since being acquired by Pittsburgh last March after spending the first six years of his NFL career with the Seattle Seahawks, hauling in seven passes for 148 yards. But the Steelers' 29th-ranked ground attack (89.2 yards) produced only 34 yards while their defense allowed Baltimore to rush for 217.Pittsburgh is 21st in the league against the run (125.3 yards allowed) but even worse defending the pass, as it ranks 28th with an average of 244 yards allowed through the air. The club also is 28th in total defense (369.3 yards allowed) but sixth with 36 sacks. The Steelers could have trouble recording one against Miami as three-time NFL sack leader T.J. Watt, who is first on the team this year with seven, was hospitalized Wednesday because of a lung issue and could miss Monday's contest.The Dolphins (6-7) were left for dead after losing six of their first seven games this season but have come out of nowhere to ever so slightly get back into the playoff picture. They have won four straight contests and five of their last six, although four of those victories came against teams with records of 4-9 or worse.Miami is one of the better rushing clubs in the league, as it ranks eighth with an average of 126.5 yards per game. The ground assault is led by De'Von Achane, who is third in the NFL with a career-high 1,126 yards. The 24-year-old posted three consecutive 100-yard performances and was on his way to a fourth straight last week as he gained 92 yards before leaving in the second quarter of a 34-10 rout of the New York Jets with a rib injury.Achane is questionable for the matchup against the Steelers, but the Dolphins historically don't perform well in cold weather. The high temperature in Pittsburgh for Monday is 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and it certainly will be below that at game time. The weather is of no concern to SportsLine's Inside the Lines team, which doesn't foresee Miami qualifying for the postseason regardless of the outcome of Monday night's contest. The ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, currently gives the Dolphins a 0.1% chance of making the playoffs and puts that number at 0.3% should they defeat the Steelers.Meanwhile, the model strongly believes the Steelers will make their third consecutive postseason appearance and fifth in six years. It puts Pittsburgh's chances at more than 73% and increases them to just over 79% with a victory on Monday. However, with the Steelers trailing four teams - including the three that occupy wild card berths - by at least one game, the model feels their best method of going to the playoffs is winning a division title.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCEPittsburgh Steelers73.5%79.2%62.2%17.0%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC NORTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCEPittsburgh Steelers73.2%78.6%62.2%16.4%Baltimore Ravens23.9%36.7%9.7%27.0%Pittsburgh follows its Monday night matchup with road games against the Detroit Lions and Browns before ending the regular season at home versus Baltimore. The Ravens visit Cincinnati this Sunday, face the AFC East-leading New England Patriots in their home finale a week later and visit the Green Bay Packers before what could be a crucial showdown in the \"Steel City.\"The Steelers lost their last meeting with the Dolphins, a 16-10 setback at Miami in 2022, but have won the last two matchups between the teams in Pittsburgh - including their clash in the 2016 wild card round. Pittsburgh is a 3.5-point favorite against Miami on Monday in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 26-19 victory for the Steelers, which would move them one step closer to the 25th division title in franchise history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        College basketball is in its supersized era. This season is shaping up to feature the tallest iteration of the sport with jumbo lineups in places like Florida, Michigan, Arizona, Duke and Illinois here to stay.According to KenPom, there are 94 teams in America with an average height of 6-foot-6, measured by who is on the floor. Ninety-four! It's a whole new world compared to 2019-20, when only 35 teams had an average height north of 6-foot-6.The reasons are obvious. To steal a football analogy, \"big people move little people.\" Controlling the glass and the paint has become a way to extract a high-floor outcome.\nThe special sauce kicks in when your big men can splash treys. Illinois' top 3-point shooter this season has been 7-foot-2 center Zvonimir Ivisic (38% on 34 attempts). Wisconsin specifically honed in on 6-10 forward Austin Rapp because he drilled 80 triples a season ago for a 12-win Portland club. College big men taking more 3s isn't a fad, it's a trend, and the terrific Jordan Sperber has the data to prove it.\nGuard play may be the separator in March, but 2025-26 is shaping up to be a year of dominant frontcourts that tilt outcomes with brute force.In the preseason, Florida and Purdue were presumed to be the best frontcourts in the nation, per CBS Sports' Kyle Boone. Where do things sit just over a month later? Let's dive in.\n    \n                                        \n    1. MichiganDusty May loves his big men, and this may be his best collection yet. The Yaxel Lendeborg, Aday Mara and Morez Johnson trio is helping fuel undefeated Michigan's rise to national championship favorite on Dec. 11 by every predictive metric.\nMichigan isn't just winning the paint battle -- it's embarrassing folks. At one point in Tuesday's 89-61 rout of Villanova, the Wolverines outscored the Wildcats 30-2 in paint points. The defense is a fortress, blending switchable athletes with terrifying enforcers on the back line. Opponents are shooting a mind-boggling 36.5% at the rim when 7-foot-3 Mara is on the floor. That's absurd.For all the fuss about playing Lendeborg, Mara and Johnson together, it's settled in nicely as a piece, not the whole piece. To borrow a baseball reference, May uses the jumbo lineup as an opener to get three quick outs. Michigan's big men play the first three or four minutes together, build a four- or five-point lead by the first media timeout and are rarely seen together again for the rest of the half.It's unrealistic to expect Michigan to be this dominant all year, but this frontcourt is a problem and the envy of plenty in coaching circles. First-month frontcourt grade: A+\n\n    \n                                        \n    2. ArizonaArizona is a battering ram. The Wildcats have made 72 more 2s than their opponents this year, ranking ninth in the nation, according to CBB Analytics, and illustrating the paint-dominance ethos Tommy Lloyd demands. Arizona's primary three bigs -- Koa Peat, Tobe Awaka and Motiejus Krivas -- have combined for just one 3-pointer, and it hasn't mattered.The Wildcats are simply overwhelming. They tilt the math in their favor with a barrage of offensive rebounds that boost efficiency and punish teams trying to run in transition. Arizona has found the perfect balance between elite offensive rebounding and elite transition defense. These hard-playing bigs are a huge reason why. Peat is a future first-round pick, and Awaka is the top backup big man in America. First-month frontcourt grade: A+\n    \n                                        \n    3. DukeDuke's frontline has both a superstar and some spirit. Out-rebounding Michigan State on the road is a Herculean feat, and Cameron Boozer has a unique ability to claw his way to dominant stat lines almost every night. Boozer's skill at playing turnover-free basketball while dominating the glass and drawing fouls at an absurd rate (6.6 per 40 minutes) tilts all the shot-volume math in Duke's favor.\nJon Scheyer can also rotate Patrick Ngongba and Maliq Brown depending on the matchup. Ngongba has started showing real improvement as a rim protector, and Brown remains a deflections machine. Duke's defense has been stout regardless of who is at the 5-spot, even if the look can change drastically schematically.Scheyer's frontcourt has every tool in the toolbox. First-month frontcourt grade: A+\n    \n                                        \n    4. GonzagaGonzaga has made 135 more 2s than its opponents. Read that again. No other team has more than 92. Michigan had the personnel to match up with Graham Ike and Braden Huff, but when the Zags don't face a historically good shot-blocking team, this frontline dominates. Ike is a tornado of elbows and muscle down the paint, and Huff has one of the premier runners that somehow always finds the bottom of the net.\nHuff and Ike combined for 48 points against Kentucky, 39 against Alabama and 34 against Creighton. They are an unrelenting duo in an offense that will feed the big men until they are stopped.This pound-the-paint mindset also helps Gonzaga be virtually upset-proof, even with some lingering rim protection concerns. First-month frontcourt grade: A\n    \n                                        \n    5. FloridaFlorida wants to be better than 5-4, but it's hard to be frustrated with this front line. Tommy Haugh has transformed into a star who looks every bit the part of a first-round pick. Rueben Chinyelu has overtaken Micah Handlogten as Florida's top option at the 5, thanks to improved offensive skill alongside his ability to dominate the boards and impact the game defensively. Chinyelu's second-half defensive performance against Boozer was as good as any showing against the Player of the Year favorite all season.\nAlex Condon has struggled to find his 3-point stroke and had some frustrating ball-handling gaffes early in November, but everything else is there. The rebounding, rim protection, effort and motor are constants, and he's improved his touch in the paint and at the free-throw line.So many teams would still want their frontcourt to look like Florida's. First-month frontcourt grade: B\n    \n                                        \n    6. Iowa StateIowa State's front line isn't the deepest, but Joshua Jefferson is playing like an All-American. No high-major big man averages more assists than Jefferson (5.4), and he ranks second in KenPom's National Player of the Year race behind Boozer. Blake Buchanan's emergence as a legitimate weapon has given Iowa State even more staying power. The Virginia transfer has been one of the nation's elite offensive rebounders while adding rim protection and athleticism.\nIn five games against high-major competition, opponents are shooting just 51% at the rim when Jefferson and Buchanan share the floor. That interior defensive bite, combined with a defense that forces turnovers at a sky-high rate, is a formula T.J. Otzelberger can use to win big.Keeping Jefferson from entering the portal and landing a piece like Buchanan has been instrumental. First-month frontcourt grade: A+\n    \n                                        \n    7. PurduePurdue's front-line trio of Trey Kaufman-Renn, Oscar Cluff and Daniel Jacobsen is giving Matt Painter 35 points and 24.4 rebounds per game. You'll take that all day, every day.\nKaufman-Renn has adjusted to a smaller offensive workload, which has allowed him to become an utter menace on the boards. His offensive rebound rate has nearly doubled now that he's a full-time 4-man, and he should still be in the All-American mix.Purdue is still ironing out some defensive kinks. Kaufman-Renn and Cluff aren't gazelles or trampoline-like leapers, so Purdue must be sharp with positioning and attention to detail. Eventually, the best version of Purdue may feature Jacobsen's shot-blocking and occasional floor-stretching ability, but Cluff has been the better option so far with his dominant work cleaning the glass. Purdue corrals an absurd 52% of its misses when Cluff and Kaufman-Renn share the floor, according to CBB Analytics. First-month frontcourt grade: B+\n    \n                                        \n    8. Michigan StateThis Michigan State frontline has a nastiness you can't duplicate. Jaxon Kohler and Carson Cooper have become anchors of one of the nation's best defenses. They're big, tough, strong, reliable and trustworthy -- qualities that give the Spartans staying power in the Big Ten. To top it off, they get rim-rattling dunks from Coen Carr, who keeps this group energized.\nTom Izzo has also gotten everything he could want from backups like Cam Ward, a high-energy, mismatch-hunting force, and Jesse McCulloch, who can step out and hit a three.Michigan State ranks eighth nationally in rebounding margin. That will play. First-month frontcourt grade: A\n    \n                                        \n    9. North CarolinaThe Henri Veesaar–Caleb Wilson combination gives UNC real appeal. Veesaar and Wilson are fast, hyper-athletic and have developed a near mind-meld in this offense. Wilson, the passer, to Veesaar, the finisher, has generated 19 points this year, according to CBB Analytics -- the third-best mark for an assister-scorer combination for the Tar Heels.Veesaar, the passer, to Wilson, the finisher, isn't far behind, producing 14 points.They simply make each other better, and UNC is reaping the rewards. First-month frontcourt grade: A-\n    \n                                        \n    10. IllinoisNo frontcourt has made more 3-pointers than Illinois. Tomislav Ivisic, Zvonimir Ivisic, Ben Humrichous and David Mirkovic have combined for 51 treys in 10 games. The barrage of 3s from the big men fuels an Illini offense ranked fifth nationally, opening the paint for Keaton Wagler, Andrej Stojakovic and Kylan Boswell to attack mismatches and get downhill.Illinois' bigs have also shown more versatility this year. Mirkovic is a force on the boards and someone offensive coordinator Tyler Underwood can run mid-post backdowns or pick-and-pops through. Humrichous has become a secondary rim protector and gritty-play contributor. Zvonimir Ivisic (13.4% block rate) can erase shots at the rim, and Tomislav Ivisic is showing more thump as an interior mismatch killer. Illinois scored 14 points directly off Tomislav Ivisic's post-ups in Saturday's win over Tennessee -- the most points from that action in his 39-game sample. First-month frontcourt grade: A\n\n    \n                                        \n    11. St. John'sIf St. John's wants to be a Tier 1 national championship contender, its guards need to pull the same weight as the bigs. Zuby Ejiofor, Bryce Hopkins, Dillon Mitchell and Ruben Prey have all delivered strong stretches for Rick Pitino. The size, speed and athleticism of the Johnnies' frontline presents a unique challenge. It's impossible to keep them off the offensive glass and hard to defend them without fouling.Once Pitino can shore up some of the weak links in this armor, St. John's should elevate back into a nasty defense that dominates the boards thanks to this star-studded quartet of forwards. First-month frontcourt grade: B\n    \n                                        \n    12. Texas TechJT Toppin is still pillaging. The Texas Tech All-American stacks 20-and-10 lines in his sleep and occasionally erupts for a 35-and-11 performance against Illinois. Toppin is inevitable, and Texas Tech's vision for this front line is starting to take shape. Elite shot-blocker Luke Bamgboye is finally healthy and beginning to coalesce into the lineup. Bootyball menace LeJuan Watts is integrating into the mix better by the day.Grant McCasland knew that building a bigger, better front line was essential if Texas Tech wanted to win a title. This group isn't there yet, but by March, it can go toe-to-toe with anybody. First-month frontcourt grade: B\n    \n                                        \n    13. UConnTarris Reed's breakout season hasn't fully arrived yet, mostly because of a few nagging leg injuries. While he's been on the mend, freshman Eric Reibe has had a chance to show his worth. The 7-foot-1, 260-pound freshman is going to be a very, very good player in time.Alex Karaban is back to balling now that he's in a smaller-usage role. He'll give up some size in certain matchups, but makes up for it with a feathery jumper, excellent cutting and a competitive streak. UConn doesn't have the two-big lineup that some teams can trot out, but its frontcourt is potent and dangerous — with room to grow if Reed can stay healthy.  First-month frontcourt grade: B+\n            ",

    "body": "\n        T.J. Watt was taken to a Pittsburgh area hospital for further evaluation of his lung after experiencing discomfort at the Steelers practice facility on Wednesday, the team announced. Watt did not practice on Thursday and his status for Pittsburgh's upcoming game against the Miami Dolphins is in question. \"I'm a little bit cautious about what I say, because I am not a medical expert,\" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin told reporters Thursday. \"But to make a long story short, he was experiencing some discomfort when he was at the facility [Wednesday}. So, we took him to the docs and they're going through some procedures. He stayed overnight in the hospital.\"He has a lung situation that's being addressed. I think he has some testing and so forth ahead of him this afternoon, and that's all I know at this juncture. He and I communicated last night, he was comfortable, and that's all I have really at this point.\" \nTomlin said he learned of Watt's situation when he was in the team's cafeteria on Wednesday. While he doesn't know when or what prompted Watt's discomfort, Tomlin does not think that it is anything that would have led to him being on the team's injury report. \"Not to my knowledge at all, particularly in game or after the game, nothing,\" he said. The 31-year-old Watt is in the middle of his ninth season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 30th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. \nA seven-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro, Watt won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2021 after tying the league's single-season record of 22.5 sacks. Watt, who has led the NFL in sacks on three separate occasions, is the Steelers' career leader with 115 sacks. Earlier this season, he surpassed his brother and future Hall of Famer JJ Watt on the NFL's career sack list. In 13 games this season, Watt has recorded 7.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception for the Steelers, who are currently 7-6 and lead the Baltimore Ravens by one game in the AFC North standings. If Watt can't face Miami, he will be replaced by Nick Herbig, a fellow former Wisconsin Badger who has made nine starts over the past two years. This season, Herbig has recorded a career-high 6.5 sacks to go with three forced fumbles, a fumble recovery and an interception. \nWatt is the second Steelers player to be hospitalized in recent days. Following Pittsburgh's Week 14 win over the Ravens, wideout DK Metcalf stayed overnight in a Baltimore area hospital after experiencing stomach pains. Tomlin said earlier this week that Metcalf is \"moving in the right direction.\" The Steelers are also dealing with injuries to tight end Darnell Washington, offensive tackle Andrus Peat, linebacker Malik Harrison, cornerback James Pierre, defensive linemen Keeanu Benton and Derrick Harmon, and safety Kyle Dugger. Washington, Peat, and Harrison are in the concussion protocol. Pierre and Benton dealing with calf and ankle injuries, respectively, that were sustained during last Sunday's win over Baltimore. Dugger (hand) has a chance to play against the Dolphins after missing last Sunday's game. Harmon's status for Monday night is up on the air as he has missed Pittsburgh's last two games with a knee injury. \nLike Watt, Harmon has made a significant impact on Pittsburgh's defense during his rookie season. The Steelers are allowing just 96 rushing yards per game when he plays but has given up an average of 191.3 rushing yards per game during the four games that he has not played in this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol on Thursday, which is how he was able to be a full practice participant ahead of Dallas' \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup with the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15. Lamb is now tracking toward a return to football 10 days after suffering a concussion on \"Thursday Night Football\" at the Detroit Lions in Week 14. His brain injury occurred when his head slammed into the Ford Field turf on an end zone target in which he attempted to make an acrobatic, one-handed catch. Lamb exhibited a fencing response in the immediate aftermath of his concussive blow to the head as his hands and fingers began to make unnatural movements. Despite that moment and it being brought up to Lamb that Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins went right back into concussion protocol in Week 14 against the Buffalo Bills in his first game back from a concussion, he doesn't have any apprehension about the 10-day turnaround from his concussion to his return. \"Man, nah, in a situation like that, bro, as far as getting hurt or getting a concussion, it's not like you're thinking about, 'Oh, what if? What if I get hurt again?' I feel like if you live in that realm and you feed that fuel, it's going to happen,\" Lamb said after practice on Thursday. \"You don't want to live in a realm like that's never going to happen again. Really, it's [about] staying level, just being positive about each and every opportunity you get and just staying blessed. You have to go out there first and play your game and don't really think too much on it. I've been hurt a couple times and I don't dwell on it. I hit my head a couple of times. I don't dwell on it. You have to move on. It's a part of the game. That's why playing football is very important, and that's why taking care of your body is even more important.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 viewer's guide: Top 10 things to watch, including Super Bowl contenders and Philip Rivers comeback\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott immediately ran up to Lamb on the field in Detroit in the immediate aftermath of the concussion, which is when saw his top target's initial fencing response. That was a cause for immediate concern in the 10-year veteran's eyes, but Prescott isn't worried about Lamb's return on Sunday against the Vikings 10 days later after seeing how he's practiced. \"Yeah, zero concern. Obviously on the field, you see a guy whatever they call that, his hands getting into that formation [a fencing response] right? Whether it's your brother, teammate or somebody on the other team, you don't want to see that. So yeah, obviously there was some urgency to get him help then, but then actually when I got over there, he was almost right back to it. I was like 'you good?' He's like 'yeah,'\" Prescott said Thursday. \"You just could tell just for a moment [that Lamb was out of it]. He was back at it Monday, doing light stuff and working out. From there, I was positive in the way that he would respond, and he's been great.\"The 26-year-old All-Pro claims he hasn't suffered from any residual effects or symptoms regarding the concussion, which is why he's confident in being able to play without concern on Sunday night after completing the protocol.  \n\"Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,\" Lamb said. \"As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest. Doing everything, me knowing my requirements, kind of getting ahead of everything, especially with the extra 2-3 days that we had off. I feel like that was big.\"Hard Knocks' latest episode on Tuesday showed Lamb begging trainers to keep him in the game while being helped off the field with him saying \"Let me play.\" When the injury happened early in the third quarter of an eventual 44-30 Dallas defeat, Lamb was on fire with 121 yards receiving on six catches. He claims to \"remember everything\" from when he suffered his concussion, which is why he asked the training staff to let him play. However, Lamb acknowledged this instance was one where he needed to be protected from himself. \"They're doing their job, and obviously me as a competitor, I want to do mine. But it's times where they do have to protect me from me. That was the situation to where that was one of them. I felt like I was having a pretty good game,\" Lamb said. \"I was just kind of getting started and getting it cooking. ... But again I'm happy for the training staff. I'm happy for everybody that's reached out. ... It was a surreal moment for me and myself and really just a quick experience. It was an opportunity for me to grow up. ... Overall, just always be grateful for each and every opportunity I can step out there.\"\nAs a result, Lamb has been practicing with the Guardian cap over his helmet in practice this week, something he said he had been doing since switching to a new helmet recently. However, he won't be wearing it during game action like Green Bay Packers wide receiver Romeo Doubs does for a simple reason. \"It's not comfortable,\" Lamb said. \nWith just 135 yards receiving across Dallas' final four games, Lamb will join Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Irvin (1991-1995) as the only players in Cowboys history with 1,000 yards receiving in five consecutive seasons. At 6-6-1, Dallas will need much more than that total from Lamb over the next four weeks to somehow backdoor their way into the postseason. \n            ",

Anderson took over the head coaching duties on an interim basis after Charles Huff departed earlier this week to fill the Memphis vacancy. He spent the 2025 season on staff as the Golden Eagles' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, marking his second stint with the program after his 2008-11 tenure as an assistant.Anderson's elevation puts him back in charge of a program for the first time since Utah State fired him for cause in 2024. He previously oversaw the Arkansas State and Utah State programs and posted a 74-53 record across the two schools with nine bowl appearances in 10 years. Anderson won the Sun Belt twice with the Red Wolves and the Mountain West once with the Aggies.\"We are excited to announce Blake Anderson as the next leader of our football program,\" Southern Miss athletic director Jeremy McClain said. \"He brings a wealth of experience and a ten-year run as a successful head coach, including multiple conference championships in the Sun Belt, a Mountain West conference championship, and nine bowl appearances. Blake is an exceptional leader, a great communicator, and has the respect of the players and the staff throughout the Duff Center. We look forward to supporting him at the highest level and continuing the positive momentum for our program.\"Utah State fired Anderson just over a month prior to the start of the 2024 season after an internal investigation concluded that he violated university Title IX policies. After an Aggies football player was arrested for alleged domestic violence in April 2023, Utah State said that Anderson did not immediately report the incident to the Office of Equity and instead conducted a personal investigation -- which included the contacting of the player's girlfriend and roommate -- to determine whether punitive action should be taken against the player.\nAnderson filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Utah State, and his lawyers accused the university of leading \"what is essentially a public smear campaign\" against their client.Anderson's coaching experience dates back to 1992 and features numerous stops throughout the Group of Five ranks. He also spent two seasons as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at North Carolina from 2012-13.\nThe best year of Anderson's career came in 2021 when he led Utah State to a Mountain West title and defeated Oregon State in the LA Bowl. The Aggies won 11 games that season, matching a program record. They also cracked the AP Top 25 poll for just the fifth time in program history.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin's return to Ole Miss as the LSU coach will come on Sept. 19 in what figures to be one of the most charged and raucous environments of the 2026 college football season. The game's date was revealed Thursday as the SEC announced its 2026 schedule, which will feature nine league contests for each team.Few will be more anticipated than Ole Miss hosting LSU and Kiffin, who left the Rebels before their 2025 College Football Playoff run to accept the Tigers' head coaching job. While Kiffin elevated Ole Miss to historic levels during his six-year run, his untidy exit for a conference rival relegated him to pariah status in the state of Mississippi.If his return is anything like his exit, Kiffin be on the recipient of intense vitriol at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, which has an official capacity of 64,038.Ole Miss fans sent Kiffin off with a chorus of jeers and one-finger salutes as he boarded a plane in Oxford, Mississippi, bound for LSU two days after the Rebels reached a program-record 11 regular-season victories. It is just the latest dramatic job transition for Kiffin, who tried desperately to rehabilitate his image during his time at Ole Miss.\n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOver roughly a year leading up to his departure, Kiffin added new layers to his public persona by touting his sobriety, improved family life and elevated emotional wellness, achieved in part by a steady devotion to yoga. With Ole Miss surging to a third consecutive 10+ win season behind strong institutional support and Kiffin appearing to have found a once-elusive inner-peace, the idea of a long-term tenure in Oxford seemed possible, if not likely.\nBut when LSU fired Brian Kelly after a 5-3 start, cracks in that foundation multiplied quickly. Already pursued by Florida for its head coaching vacancy, Kiffin suddenly had two SEC programs with multiple 21st century national championships vying for his services.\nEven while attempting to project a \"business as usual\" mantra at Ole Miss, it was clear Kiffin's mind was elsewhere. Members of his family took visits to both Gainesville, Florida, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shortly after the Rebels beat Florida on Nov. 15.Returning to a stadium where he is loathed won't be new for Kiffin, who has been back to Tennessee three times as either Alabama's offensive coordinator or as the Ole Miss head coach since leaving the Volunteers for USC after a one-year stint as the program's head coach in 2009. He will coach at Tennessee again in 2026 as the Tigers travel to Neyland Stadium in 2026 as well. \nHowever, his return to Ole Miss with LSU will mark the first time he's ever coached against the school he left just one season later. That the game is at Ole Miss only adds to the intrigue of what figures to be a wild scene.\n            ",

The Bucs play three division games in the final four weeks of the season and need to stack wins in those contests, starting with this one on Thursday night.Atlanta has been on an even bigger slide, losing seven of its last eight games. The Falcons aren't even playing for draft positioning, either, because they traded their first-round pick to the Rams during last year's draft. They are playing out the string here and fighting for jobs next season and in the future.Which of these two teams will be able to stop their recent stretch of poor play? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down some of the key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Buccaneers vs. FalconsDate: Thursday, Dec. 11 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium (Tampa, Florida)Stream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -4.5, O/U 44.5 via DraftKings SportsbookKey StorylinesNFC South race. The Buccaneers and Panthers are tied with matching 7-6 records, but the Bucs currently sit in first place in the division thanks to the common opponents tiebreaker. (They haven't played each other yet and they're both 2-1 in the division, so they have to go to the third tiebreaker to decide which team is ahead.) Tampa plays Atlanta here, then travels to Carolina next week and Miami the week after before hosting the Panthers to end the season. The Panthers get the Saints on the road this week before hosting the Bucs and Seahawks and then traveling to Tampa to end the year. Buccaneers injury returns. The Bucs have already gotten Bucky Irving back and now they are getting Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan back as well. Evans has been out since suffering a collarbone injury back in Week 4. McMillan has yet to play this season after suffering a neck injury during the preseason. The Bucs offense has not been as good lately as it was to start the season, so these returns should provide a significant boost.Falcons in a tailspin. Atlanta has lost seven of its last eight games after starting the season 3-2. There could be changes on the horizon if Raheem Morris and Co. can't turn things around down the stretch. Doing so is going to be difficult because they're working with a backup quarterback and a defense that has badly regressed since starting the season as one of the hotter units in the league. If the Falcons continue to stumble, we could see a new head coach and/or general manager in Atlanta next season.Buccaneers vs. Falcons prediction, pick\nTampa isn't exactly lighting the world on fire of late, but the Falcons seem to be dead in the water. Tampa should be able to move the ball on Thursday night, especially with Evans and McMillan returning to from injury. The Falcons, meanwhile, seemingly cannot move the ball with any degree of consistency with Kirk Cousins under center. The Bucs have a good run defense and are weaker against the pass, which plays against what the Falcons would like to do given the current state of their roster. \nPick: Buccaneers 24, Falcons 13 | (Tampa Bay -4.5, Under 44.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is fully underway, and with the Winter Meetings freshly behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Thursday's roundup just below. Braves land reliever SuarezThe Atlanta Braves have agreed to terms with free-agent closer Robert Suarez on a three-year, $45 million contract, the club announced on Thursday. \nEarlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Suarez as the No. 21 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \"Suarez has garnered a reputation for flakiness. It's not entirely merited. Over the last three seasons, he's compiled more shutdowns and fewer meltdowns than Jeff Hoffman, Ryan Helsley, Matt Strahm, among other high-leverage pitchers with a higher perceived trust rating. One part of Suarez's repute that is valid: his fastball dependency. He upped his changeup rate year to year, but he still threw one heater or the other 75 out of every 100 pitches. If it works, the old parlance goes, it works.\"Suarez, 34, for his career boasts an ERA+ of 141 with an FIP of 3.36 across parts of four MLB seasons, all with the Padres. His 40 saves in 2025 led the National League. In all, the two-time All-Star has struck out 219 batters in 210 career innings. In Atlanta, Raisel Iglesias, who re-signed on a one-year, $16 million deal earlier this winter, figures to get most of the save opportunities, while Suarez will primarily work as a high-leverage setup man, according to the Athletic. Skubal probably on the move?When it comes to repeat American League Cy Young winner Tarik Subal of the Detroit Tigers, trade speculation has been consistent heading into his walk year of 2026 and with no discernible progress made on an extension. On that front, a Skubal trade this offseason is increasingly seen as likely, reports ESPN's Jorge Castillo. \nNeedless to say, such a trade would be the biggest move of the winter in light of Skubal's present level of dominance: \nThose numbers are right in line with what he did in 2024, and the 29-year-old left-hander has the best-in-class stuff to back it up. It goes without saying that any team with any hope of contention in 2026 can use a pitcher of Skubal's rare caliber. That includes, first and foremost, the Tigers, who have logged back-to-back plate appearances. Even so, lead exec Scott Harris may decide he'd rather get a haul now than see Skubal walk at season's end. Cubs getting trade interest in HoernerThe Chicago Cubs are presumably aiming to return to the playoffs again in 2026, which means it would make little sense to trade standout second baseman Nico Hoerner. Hoerner's just 28 and signed through next season at bargain rates. He's also a two-time Gold Glove winner who over the past four seasons has stacked up a total WAR of 19.6. That's not the kind of player a serious team trades away. Still, Hoerner's name has indeed come up in trade conversations with the Cubs, according to the Athletic. Presumably, the Cubs would entertain offers for Hoerner only if it addressed current roster needs elsewhere, but who's to say in light of the listless stewardship of the Ricketts family. \nYankees possibly entertaining Jazz trade talkSpeaking of contenders getting asks on core players, the Yankees have at least indulged inquiries about the trade status of infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr, ESPN reports. Chisholm was a core member of the Yanks last season, as he had an OPS+ of 125 and a WAR of 4.2 in his first full season in the Bronx, and profiles as key piece moving forward. He's 27 and headed into his third and final year of arbitration eligibility in 2026. Payroll of course should not be a concern for the Yankees, but owner Hal Streinbrenner has been reluctant to put the full power of the club's resources into the on-field product. As such, the Chisholm discussions, to whatever extent they're serious, may be viewed as partial salary offsets for moves later in the offseason. Boras pitching Bregman to MarinersStandout infielder Alex Bregman remains on the free-agent market after a strong 2025 season with the Red Sox: \nHe's a three-time All-Star who's still operating at the top of his game and the Red Sox are by all accounts interested in bringing him back. As well, the Cubs and Tigers have also been connected to Bregman and agent Scott Boras is of course busy angling to drum up more interest in one of his marquee clients. Speaking of which, here's this from Adam Jude of the Seattle Times: \n\"Mega agent Scott Boras, representing Alex Bregman, the top free-agent third baseman on the market, has initiated discussions with the Mariners to express Bregman's willingness to consider Seattle as a destination, an industry source told The Times.\"The interest may not be entirely mutual, as the M's are more likely to go with an internal solution at the hot corner next season or add to the infield via trade. No doubt, though, the presence of Bregman would significantly improve Seattle's outlook in 2026 and beyond. \n            ",

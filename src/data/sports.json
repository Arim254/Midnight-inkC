    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- Retirement will have to wait a little while longer for Matthew Stafford. After being named NFL MVP for the first time in his 17-year NFL career, the Los Angeles Rams quarterback announced on the NFL Honors stage that he will be back for the 2026 season. Before this announcement on Thursday night, Stafford's playing future had been up in the air ever since the Rams' season ended in the NFC Championship. \"I'll see you guys next year,\" Stafford said with the MVP award in hand and four daughters alongside him. \n\"It's something that I've been thinking about,\" Stafford told reporters after receiving the award. \"Talking with my family about even before the season ended, whether or not they wanted me to continue to play and whether or not it felt like I wanted to keep playing. I ended the season on a healthy note and was a part of a great team. I had a bunch of teammates in the crowd, coaches in the crowd, and it just felt like the right thing to do at the right moment. \"It's a family decision. I have my girls with me, so it just felt right. Happy to be coming back.\"Stafford, 37, just completed a prolific 2025 season that found him voted as a first-team All-Pro along with this MVP honor. His 46 passing touchdowns were a franchise record and a career high for the former No. 1 overall pick in 2009. He was also just the fourth quarterback all time with at least 45 passing touchdowns and under 10 interceptions on the year.\n\"This game takes a lot out of you,\" Stafford said when asked why he considered retirement after a season where he played at such an elite level. \"You saw the people, the four little girls that were standing on stage with me, and I want to be as big a part of their life as I possibly can be. That's really important to me, and if they weren't supportive of me playing, I wouldn't do it. \"I'm lucky to have little girls that want their dad to do what he loves to do. They love cheering me on and all my teammates. It's a special thing to have that, but it's not something I'm willing to lose over a game that I love to play there's no question about it but if they weren't behind me in that decision, I don't care how good I played that year or the year before or whatever it is, you know, we'd have some real talks.\"Stafford is also just the 15th quarterback ever to win MVP and have a Super Bowl on his résumé. Ten of those other 14 players are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while three of the ones currently on the outside looking in are simply not eligible, but will get in (Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes). \nWith that in mind, Stafford has positioned himself quite nicely to one day be enshrined in Canton, Ohio, but the clock for his eligibility won't start ticking quite yet. \n            ",

Here's why and how to watch:Why are Milan and Christian Pulisic not playing this weekend? AC Milan won't be playing this weekend in Italy as the home stadium of the Rossoneri, San Siro, will host the opening ceremony of the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic games on Friday. AC Milan, currently second in the Serie A standings, five points behind Inter, were supposed to face Como this weekend, but as San Siro couldn't host soccer games for the last two weeks due to the opening ceremony, Massimiliano Allegri's team will meet Cesc Fabregas' Como on Wednesday, Feb. 18 at 2:45 p.m. ET. The Italian Serie A tried to play this fixture between AC Milan and Como in Perth, Australia, just like how LaLiga attempted to play Barcelona vs. Villarreal in Miami last year but then announced on Dec. 22 that \"plans for Perth to host the first ever official European league match for points outside its national borders are off, following the mutual agreement of Lega Calcio Serie A and the Western Australian Government. Both parties have come to this decision due to financial risks that could not be mitigated, onerous approval conditions, and last-minute complications beyond their control,\" they said. How to watch Juventus vs. Lazio, oddsDate: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Allianz Stadium -- Turin Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Juventus -132; Draw +244; Lazio +395How to watch Serie A Matchday 24All times U.S./Eastern. \nFriday, Feb. 6Hellas Verona vs. Pisa, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Saturday, Feb. 7Genoa vs. Napoli, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Fiorentina vs. Torino, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, Feb. 8Bologna vs. Parma, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Lecce vs. Udinese, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Sassuolo vs. Inter, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Juventus vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, Feb. 9Atalanta vs. Cremonese, 12:30 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Cagliari, 12:30 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

The newspaper claimed athletes were putting the acid into their penises for enhancement.In ski jumping events, suit size -- in this case, larger -- is considered advantageous. \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance,\" WADA director general Olivier Niggli said at a press conference this week. \"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"Suits must conform to an athlete's body and are fitted before the start of every jumping season.\n\"Every extra centimeter on a suit counts,\" Sandro Pertile, race director for the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), said in 2024. \"If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further.\"Last August, two Olympic gold medalist ski jumpers and three staffers on the Norway men's team were charged with ethics violations after \"equipment manipulation\" following an investigation stemming from a March incident. The Norway team were reportedly caught on video adding stitching into the crotch area of their suits to make them bigger and thus, more aerodynamic during competition.Per the BBC, Norway coach Magnus Brevik and equipment manager Adrian Livelten admitted the suits were altered prior to the team's participation in the large hill event.\n\"We regret it like dogs, and I'm terribly sorry that this happened,\" Brevik said.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA trade deadline has come and gone, and while Giannis Antetokounmpo may still be a Milwaukee Buck, there are plenty of other big names on the move. Many of them are headed for unconventional destinations. Usually, when a big name moves, it's because some team ready to win right away makes an all-in push to get him. But think of where the five recent All-Stars who got traded actually landed:Two of them, Trae Young and Anthony Davis, now play for the 13-36 Wizards.A third, Jaren Jackson Jr., now plays for the 16-35 Jazz.The final two, James Harden and Darius Garland, got traded for one another despite their 10-year age gap.You could make an argument that the single player who netted the most at the deadline was Ivica Zubac. He went to the 13-38 Pacers. Most of the trades at this year's deadline won't affect the 2026 championship race, but plenty of them will have significant ramifications for the longer haul. So let's pick some winners and losers from the last month or so of movement.Winner: Pacers or Clippers (lottery-dependent)You could argue that, no matter how things shake out in May, both the Pacers and Clippers were trade deadline winners. The Clippers turned a 36-year-old All-Star into a 26-year-old All-Star and a center at the peak of his value into a good young wing and multiple first-round picks. The Pacers improved on Myles Turner with a better player and contract in Ivica Zubac, setting them up to jump right back into the championship picture next season. Both teams got what they wanted.But one of them is going to get a whole lot more out of this deadline than they now have. As part of the Zubac trade, the Clippers will receive Indiana's 2026 first-round pick... protected between No. 1 and No. 4 and No. 10 and No. 30. If it lands between No. 5 and 9, it goes to the Clippers. If not, it stays in Indiana, with a 2031 unprotected pick headed west instead.\nSo here's where we now sit: if Indiana gets in the top four, it has not only set itself up to return to the championship picture next season, but to add a possible franchise player in the process. They could not ask for a better use of this lost, Tyrese Haliburton-less season. And if the pick lands between No. 5 and No. 9, the Clippers, in symbolically appropriate timing considering this year represents the final pick they are set to send Oklahoma City in the Paul George trade, gets access to exactly the sort of young talent it needs to rebuild after the Kawhi Leonard era ends in the near future.\n        \n            \n                Ivica Zubac trade grades: Winner of Pacers, Clippers deal will be decided on lottery night\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt this moment, Indiana has a 52.1% chance at keeping the pick. The Clippers have a 47.9% chance of claiming it. It is, in effect, the highest stakes coin flip of the 2026 offseason. One of these teams is going to walk away from the deadline in reasonably good shape. The other is arguably its biggest winner.Loser: WizardsThe Wizards clearly wanted to get better next season, when they no longer need to worry about owing a top-eight protected pick to the New York Knicks. That's a reasonable goal. Teams rarely want to waste more than three years in the tank. You could argue getting Trae Young was an appropriate step in that direction. Young is a well-known floor-raiser given his stellar pick-and-roll shot-creation. Having a veteran to keep the offense organized stood to benefit the younger players even if it cost them shots, and as Young has only one year left on his contract and cost no picks, the risk was minimal. \nHad the Wizards moved forward just with Young, they still would have brought max cap space into the offseason. They could have used that to add multiple, younger free agents. They could have tried to use a front-loaded offer sheet to try to steal a restricted free agent (say, Peyton Watson in Denver, or Walker Kessler in Utah). They could have gotten picks to take on bad money. Cap space can be used in a variety of ways. There aren't many ways you can go wrong with it. One of them is bringing a soon-to-be 33-year-old with two supermax years left on his contract and literally hundreds of injuries on his résumé onto a team that's several years away from winning seriously in the playoffs.That's what Washington did with Anthony Davis. They'll pay him roughly $120 million over the next two years without having much of a clue about how often he'll be able to play for them. Even if he defies the odds and stays healthy, Washington has suddenly added two very high-usage players onto a young core that needs touches to develop. The Young-Davis pick-and-roll should be dangerous. I'm not sure how helpful watching it will be for Alex Sarr, Kyshawn George and Tre Johnson.The Wizards spent years stuck in the middle. Wasn't the point of the 2023 teardown to prevent that from happening again? Now, if the Wizards land a top-three pick in the lottery, they might get someone so good none of this matters. But as it stands, it looks like they've added two former All-Stars whose best days are behind them to lead the way for a few years. By the time Sarr, George and Johnson are ready to win seriously, Davis at least will be past his prime, and Young will be such a defensive liability that he likely won't be worth a significant salary if those recent draft picks have developed enough to lead the offense. The basic idea of getting better next season wasn't crazy. Doing so in this manner is ultimately going to be counterproductive. There were a number of ways they could have used their cap flexibility to improve in both the present and the future. Instead they went for the older famous guy whose durability issues might prevent him from helping either timeline.\nWinner: CelticsIn June, the Celtics were staring down the barrel of a half-billion dollar payroll. In the eight months or so since, they managed to go from far above the second apron to out of the luxury tax entirely, saving around $325 million in total payroll for this season. They did so without giving up a single first-round pick and they are currently tied for the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference, exactly where they finished last year, when, in addition to a bigger payroll, they also had a healthy Jayson Tatum.This is some of the most incredible cap work a front office has ever done. Now, you might not care if Bill Chisholm saves a bunch of money, but I assure you, it matters in the long run. The Celtics are a repeat taxpayer. That comes with incredibly punitive multipliers on their tax bill. If Tatum were healthy, the Celtics likely would have bit the bullet, kept last year's team together and figured it out later. But with him out, they had a golden opportunity. Ducking the tax this year and next year means that Boston resets its repeater clock entirely. That means that between 2028 and 2030, the Celtics can effectively spend with impunity. They'll be taxpayers, of course, but they won't have to worry about to downright draconian rates the repeater tax imposes. This is notable because key 2026 discoveries Neemias Queta and Jordan Walsh are free agents after the 2026-27 season. If the Celtics stay below the tax line next year, they can re-sign both without fear of long-term consequences. Tatum and Jaylen Brown are still young enough to compete for championships for a long time. Boston's championship odds were always going to be at their lowest in the year Tatum mostly or entirely missed with a torn Achilles and his first full year back. Now they're positioned to maximize the years in their early 30s when both should be close to full strength.\nOh, and the cherry on top? They needed a center who could shoot and they got one in Nikola Vučević. He's past his prime at this point, but still an effective player who offers a nice stylistic shift compared to Queta at center. He'll help the Celtics this year. But the future is what really matters.Loser: KingsDid the Kings get a first-round pick for Domantas Sabonis? Sadly, no. Talks with the Raptors seemingly fizzled out over the inclusion of Jakob Poeltl's albatross contract. Did they get off of the last year of Zach LaVine's deal? Sadly, no. There had been some buzz that the Bucks were desperate enough to add him, but such a deal never materialized. Did they at least manage to trade away DeMar DeRozan, who has $10 million guaranteed next season? Come on, they're in the loser category, you know where this is going.So what did the Kings do? Well, they used Keon Ellis, a valuable young guard that several contenders wanted, to dump Dennis Schröder's contract... which they themselves signed eight months ago. The irony to that is that they could have signed Ellis to a team-friendly long-term deal last summer, but instead set him up for unrestricted free agency by picking up his cheap team option because they needed the extra savings for Schröder. Great work.\nAll of this ends with the Kings taking in De'Andre Hunter, a player who's struggled enough this season that the win-now Cavaliers were eager to dump him. Doing so increased their payroll significantly next season, so now, the Kings, depending on where they draft, should expect to be more than $10 million above the luxury tax line. If they can't find a big trade over the summer, they might need to waive DeRozan and eat that $10 million guarantee just to duck the tax. And of course, if Hunter plays well for the Kings, he only helps them win games they should really be trying to lose with an incredible draft class incoming. There's no version of this trade that works out for Sacramento. As always, we're left completely bewildered by the Kings.Winner: TimberwolvesOver the summer, the Timberwolves lost key reserve Nickeil Alexander-Walker because re-signing him would have taken them above the second apron. Minnesota perhaps could have cleared the room to keep him by dumping Mike Conley, but they elected to keep their veteran point guard, and now Alexander-Walker is having a breakout season in Atlanta. The Timberwolves haven't been able to replace him internally, so they did so externally.Ayo Dosunmu shares many traits with Alexander-Walker. He's an athletic, defensive-minded guard whose jump shot came along later in his career, and like Alexander-Walker, he's spent most of his early career on uncompetitive teams. Now he gets to show what he can do on a winner. Minnesota traded Conley as part of the cap maneuvering to get Dosunmu... but here's the kicker: he's probably coming back. NBA rules prevent a player from rejoining a team that traded him if he is waived by his new team during that same league year. However, that rule only applies to the most recent team that traded for the player. Chicago got Conley, but then traded him again to Charlotte. This lifts Minnesota's reacquisition restriction, and sure enough, Conley has since been waived. The Timberwolves are getting their Alexander-Walker replacement without losing their beloved point guard.\nAll of this maneuvering did cost the Timberwolves former No. 8 pick Rob Dillingham. That stings. The Timberwolves played a monstrous premium to get that pick: a top-1 protected 2030 first-round swap as well as an unprotected 2031 first-round pick. But Dillingham had no path to consistent playing time in Minnesota, and just ask Golden State what happens when you hold onto a player like that for too long. The Wolves acted quickly enough to get value for Dillingham, and it puts them in a better position to compete this postseason.Loser: HeatThe Heat are headed for their fourth straight Play-In Tournament. In that time, they have swung and missed on several possible star trades, most notably Damian Lillard, Kevin Durant and now, Giannis Antetokounmpo. They were a rumored suitor for Ja Morant at the deadline as a consolation prize, but couldn't seal that deal either. None of their recent draft picks have popped as genuine difference-makers like Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro once did, and Kel'El Ware, the highest-upside youngster on the team, has recently seen his playing time fluctuate quite a bit. The revamped, Noah LaRoche-inspired offense has flopped after a hot start. Their vaunted culture was pierced last season by Jimmy Butler's ugly exit.If this were any other team, we'd be saying it's time for the Heat to tear things down and rebuild. People make jokes about Chicago's annual Play-In loss to the Heat... but the Heat are also in those Play-In games. This is a team seemingly trapped in the middle, and we're just supposed to pretend that isn't a problem because they're the Heat, and they've dug themselves out of similar holes in the past.\nWell, sooner or later they're going to have to actually take a swing. This roster doesn't have it, and there's no use hovering around .500 every year if you have no path to greater upside beyond hoping \"maybe this is the year the No. 15 pick gives us another Adebayo.\" Maybe they don't need a teardown quite yet, but their failure to make any impact addition at this year's deadline should raise a red flag. One way or another, this era of Heat basketball should end soon.\n            ",

This distinction is handed out to the top offensive lineman of the year, and the inaugural winner for 2026 is Chicago Bears guard Joe Thuney. This award caps off a stellar first season in Chicago for Thuney, who was acquired by the Bears in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs this offense and subsequently inked to a two-year, $35 million extension. \nThuney spearheaded a revamped offensive line in Chicago that proved to be a key reason for their turnaround under first year head coach Ben Johnson. After being sacked a league-leading 68 times over his rookie season, Caleb Williams was sacked just 24 times in 2025 with Thuney and others installed upfront. In 17 games this season, Thuney did not allow a single sack, just one quarterback hit, and 14 pressures, according to TruMedia. Thuney entered the NFL as a third-round draft choice of the New England Patriots in 2016. After helping the organization to two Super Bowl titles as a key cog along the offensive line, he signed with Kansas City in 2021, where he won two more titles. \nThuney was chosen by a panel of six former All-Pro linemen: LeCharles Bentley, Jason Kelce, Shaun O'Hara, Orlando Pace, Will Shields, and Andrew Whitworth. He beat out fellow finalists Garrett Bolles, Aaron Brewer, Creed Humphrey, Quinn Meinerz, and Penei Sewell. \n            \n    ",

This comes after the Cleveland Browns pass rusher orchestrated a record-setting year, breaking the single-season sack record with 23. This is the second DPOY award Garrett has won in his career, with the first coming in 2023. Garrett's 23 sacks surpassed both Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021), who co-held the record at 22.5. On top of the sacks, Garrett had 33 tackles for loss, which were the second-most in the NFL over the last 25 years. His 39 quarterback hits also ranked second in the league in 2025. The former No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft was heads and shoulders above the rest of his peers this season when it came to sacking the quarterback. Garrett had 6.5 more sacks than the next closest player this season (Brian Burns with 16.5). \nPlayer2025 NFL Sack LeadersMyles Garrett23.0Brian Burns16.5Danielle Hunter15.0Aidan Hutchsinson14.5Nik Bonitto14.0\nOne critique of Garrett breaking the sack record has been that the Browns pass rusher did have the luxury of an extra game with the NFL moving to an 18-week regular season (17 games) in 2021. However, as CBS Sports Research notes, Garrett actually had fewer chances to collect sacks this season than both Strahan and Watt. In 2025, the Browns faced 562 dropbacks, which was the third-fewest in the NFL. When Strahan broke the record in 2001, his Giants faced 576 dropbacks. As for Watt, his Steelers faced 649 dropbacks in 2021 when he tied himself with Strahan. That further highlights just how impressive and dominant Garrett was this season. \nGarrett beat out a group of finalists consisting of Will Anderson Jr. (Texans), Nik Bonitto (Broncos), Aidan Hutchinson (Lions), and Micah Parsons (Packers) for the award. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The LA Bowl has been played for the last time as organizers announced Thursday that Washington's win over Boise State in December was the final iteration of the five-year-old postseason event. That brings the total number of bowl games expected to finish out the upcoming 2026 season to 40, which could decrease further in the coming years for some of the small events with further College Football Playoff expansion potentially on its way in the future.\"After five great years, the LA Bowl at Sofi Stadium will no longer be moving forward. It has been an honor for our staff and volunteers to bring college football to one of the world's greatest venues,\" a statement from LA Bowl organizers said. \"We want to thank the athletes and football programs who participated and, most importantly, the college football fans who joined us over these past five seasons.\"The LA Bowl had been played in Inglewood, California, since 2021 and featured teams from the Pac-12 and Mountain West. The game never had a repeat matchup and Boise State was the only team that played in the event twice.\n        \n            \n                Mountain West extends partnership with CBS Sports: League announces new football media rights package\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBowl season as we know it faces uncertainty moving forward given the sport's unruly December calendar and singular transfer portal window in January. Bowl Season executive director Nick Carparelli said last season that bowl games will always have their place, but their total number will be dictated by the number of interested participating teams.\nMore than a half-dozen programs declined bowl opportunities in December, including Notre Dame. There were even a couple games that featured five-win teams as there was a shortage of programs who met the minimum six-win eligibility requirement.\"The bowl system is a market-driven system. Through the 100 years of bowl games, no one has ever dictated how many bowl games there are,\" Carparelli told The Athletic. \"They've been strictly a function of host communities that want to host them and teams that want to participate. If at any point in time, the institutions decide as much as we love the bowl system, we may want to participate at a different level, then the bowl system will adjust accordingly.But no one's in a position to say what the number is, or to make any of those decisions. The market will dictate it.\"An increasing number of player opt-outs in non-CFP games is an obvious issue from a competitive standpoint, not to mention bowl practices getting in the way of recruiting.\nBowl games aren't often seen as the \"reward\" they once were for an admirable finish, especially with college football's all-in push toward the playoff.\n            ",

Smith-Njigba put together one of the most prolific seasons in recent memory en route to winning OPOY and also earned a first-team All-Pro selection in the process. He beat out fellow receiver, Puka Nacua of the Los Angeles Rams, for the honor.Smith-Njigba led the NFL with 1,793 yards receiving over the regular season, which also set a new franchise record. In fact, his receiving yard total blew the previous record held by DK Metcalf (1,303) out of the water. Smith-Njigba rewrote the record book while being the most involved pass catcher in the league this season, notching an NFL-high 36.2% target share. \nSmith-Njigba is just the sixth wide receiver to ever win Offensive Player of the Year since the award began being handed out in 1972. He joins Justin Jefferson (2022), Cooper Kupp (2021), Michael Thomas (2019), and Jerry Rice (1993 and 1987) as the only receivers to win the award. Of course, Smith-Njigba does have bigger fish to fry as his Seahawks are gearing up for a matchup with the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX on Sunday. Already, he is just the fifth player to lead the league in receiving yards and reach the Super Bowl. Each of those prior four receivers ended up winning the Super Bowl, so this is potentially an encouraging sign for Seattle, if history is any indicator. \nPlayer (year)Lead the NFL in rec. yardsReached Super BowlSB resultJaxon Smith-Njigba (2025)YesYes???Cooper Kupp (2021)YesYesWonJerry Rice (1994)YesYesWonJerry Rice (1989)YesYesWonDrew Pearson (1977)YEsYesWonSmith-Njigba and the Seahawks will kick off Super Bowl LX against New England on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET. \n            \n    ",

At Thursday's NFL Honors, Vrabel was named Coach of the Year for the 2025 season after spearheading an eye-popping turnaround with New England. What Vrabel was able to accomplish in Year 1 with the Patriots was nothing short of remarkable. The franchise had endured back-to-back 4-13 seasons, which resulted in the team moving on from Bill Belichick after the 2023 campaign and then firing Jerod Mayo after a lone season in 2024. Vrabel became the first head coach to inherit a 13-loss team and win at least 13 games in his first year. So far, the Patriots have tallied 17 wins in Year 1 of the Vrabel era (including playoffs), which ties him with George Seifert for the most all time. If he wins Super Bowl LX, he'd own the record on his own with 18. Year (Team)CoachMost wins in Year 1 (including playoffs)2025 (Patriots)Mike Vrabel171989 (49ers)George Seifert172009 (Colts)Jim Caldwell16Beyond that, New England won the AFC East for the first time since 2019 and is now on the doorstep of a Super Bowl appearance. If the Patriots defeat the Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, Vrabel would become the fifth coach to win a Super Bowl in his first season on the job. He's also just the third person to win the Super Bowl as a player and coach for any franchise and the first to do so with the same team. \nThis is the second time Vrabel has won the award, first claiming it in 2021 when he was head coach of the Tennessee Titans. This year, he beat out a group of finalists consisting of Liam Coen (Jaguars), Ben Johnson (Bears), Mike Macdonald (Seahawks), and Kyle Shanahan (49ers). \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Just three days ago, it didn't seem like the Los Angeles Clippers were going to do much of anything at the trade deadline. They'd won 17 of their previous 21 games, the NBA's best record during that stretch, to totally turn around their season after a 6-21 start. If they were going to make any moves, they profiled as buyers as they climbed to ninth in the West with Kawhi Leonard playing at an MVP level. \"In our situation, I don't see much movement,\" coach Tyronn Lue had recently told reporters.That quote is now hilarious. Before Thursday's deadline, the Clippers traded their second- and third-best players. The front office completely reoriented the franchise, prioritizing the future over the remainder of this season. They were the kind of moves you'd expect from the most disappointing team in the league, not the hottest one. They were also two of the best trades that any team made at the deadline.I find every part of this strange, as I liked seeing Los Angeles turn into the type of team I thought it would be coming into the season. From that vantage point, it's a bit of a bummer to watch the organization pivot away from what was working. There is no way, though, that I can argue with what the Clippers did from a team-building perspective. They didn't just turn James Harden into an All-Star-caliber guard 10 years his junior; they convinced the Cleveland Cavaliers to send them a second-round pick for their trouble. And they didn't just turn Ivica Zubac into multiple picks in a deal with the Indiana Pacers; they turned him into a pair of good firsts, one of which is particularly interesting.\n        \n            \n                James Harden's early-exit legacy is likely cemented, but that doesn't make it any less complicated\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's start with the Harden trade. Unless Garland has the most persistent case of turf toe in history, the Clippers will look brilliant for buying low on him. Just last season, Garland had the best year of his career, averaging 20.6 points on 60% true shooting as an integral part of the league's top offense. After two-plus years of Harden running the show, it will be jarring to see this team with a lead guard who is active and dangerous off the ball. \nGiven concerns about durability -- he's played in only 26 games this season and has been out since mid-January, but told reporters in LA that he's \"ready to hoop\" -- and the defensive viability of a Garland-Donovan Mitchell backcourt, it's understandable that the Cavaliers, firmly in win-now mode (and convince-Mitchell-to-sign-an-extension mode) wanted to swap him for Harden. For a Clippers team that was ancient and light on draft capital, though, this was a no-brainer. They sidestepped extension discussions with a star who turns 37 in August and replaced him with a 26-year-old who will be a core player going forward.I am curious to see if the Clippers, who rank 30th in offensive pace, speed things up with Garland. The biggest question coming out of the deadline, though, is what will happen with the protected pick they received in the Zubac deal. The particulars are fascinating. In a throwback to the 2012 trade that sent Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets to the Toronto Raptors, the Pacers agreed to send Los Angeles their pick in this year's loaded draft with double protection, so it stays in Indiana if it falls between No. 1 and No. 4 or if it's No. 10 onward.This is a hell of a risk for the Pacers. If the lottery lands them between No. 5 and No. 9, they'll have to send the draft pick that was supposed to be their reward for a \"gap year\" to Los Angeles. And if doesn't, then the outcome isn't necessarily bad for Los Angeles: It will immediately turn into to an unprotected 2031 first-round pick. (There are, obviously, a wide range of outcomes. If Indiana wins the lottery and pairs Kansas star Darryn Peterson with Tyrese Haliburton, I'd bet against them sending the Clippers an awesome pick in 2031.) At the moment, the Pacers have the NBA's third-worst record; if that holds, Los Angeles will have a 47.9% chance of getting the pick, per Tankathon.\n\n        \n            \n                Ivica Zubac trade grades: Winner of Pacers, Clippers deal will be decided on lottery night\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nZubac, 28, is an excellent player and an incredible development story. The Clippers stole him from the Los Angeles Lakers at the 2019 deadline, and since then he's improved as a rim protector, a post-up threat, a passer and a finisher. He earned a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team last year, and he'll feast as a roll man next to Halliburton next season. That said, one could make the case that the aforementioned pick alone would be worth giving him up. In addition, the Clippers got Indiana's unprotected (!) 2029 pick, plus wing Bennedict Mathurin and big man Isaiah Jackson. (They also sent wing Kobe Brown to the Pacers.)Mathurin was a popular Most Improved Player candidate coming into the season, but, in the last year of his rookie contract, he failed to convince the Pacers that they needed to keep him around. He has upped his 3-point rate, though, and is averaging 17.5 points on 58.6% true shooting, both career highs. The former No. 6 pick is still just 23 years old and a talented bucket-getter, and the Clippers will get to spend some time with him before deciding how they want to approach his restricted free agency. They did Indiana a favor by taking on Jackson's contract, which doesn't expire until 2028, but he at least gives them another big body with Zubac walking out the door.Like all trades involving picks, young players and injury concerns, there are a lot of variables here, and the protected Pacers pick is an unusually wild one. We don't need the benefit of hindsight, though, to know that, value-wise, the Clippers crushed this deadline. Until now, they were at the end of an era that began with the arrival of Leonard and Paul George in 2019, trying to make the best of the situation without sacrificing flexibility. Now they've started to build something new.\n            ",

The Los Angeles Rams quarterback was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the 2025 season at the NFL Honors on Thursday night. This comes after a sensational season for the veteran quarterback, who also earned first-team All-Pro honors. Stafford beat out Drake Maye of the New England Patriots for the award by one first-place vote.After accepting the award, Stafford announced that he will be returning in 2026 after initial speculation that the veteran may retire, saying, \"I'll see you guys next year.\"Stafford now becomes the oldest quarterback to win his first NFL MVP award at 37 years old. His 46 passing touchdowns on the year not only led the NFL, but were a career high and set a new franchise record for Los Angeles. The veteran was just the fourth quarterback in the history of the league to have at least 45 passing touchdowns and under 10 interceptions in a season. QBs with 45+ pass TDs & under 10 INTs in a seasonSeasonMVP?Matthew Stafford 2025YesAaron Rodgers2020YesAaron Rodgers2011YesTom Brady2007YesMoreover, Stafford joined Tom Brady (2007) as the only players to lead the NFL in passing touchdowns, passing yards, and TD-INT ratio over the last 50 seasons.  \nWith those kinds of numbers, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that he finds himself the MVP of the league. \nWith this MVP award now on his résumé to pair with his Super Bowl LVI title, the next question surrounding Stafford is whether or not he has now propelled himself to one day being enshrined in Canton, Ohio, at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  \nQBs with SB title and MVP awardIn the Pro Football Hall of Fame?Matthew Stafford???Joe MontanaYesTerry BradshawYesBart StarrYesJohn ElwayYesPeyton ManningYesJohnny UnitasYesKen StablerYesSteve YoungYesBrett FavreYesKurt WarnerYesTom BradyNot eligible yetAaron RodgersNot eligible yetPatrick MahomesNot eligible yetJoe TheismannNoOf the 14 quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl, along with an NFL MVP award, 10 have been inducted into the Hall of Fame, three are not eligible yet, and only one (Joe Theismann, who had a career-ending leg injury) has been rejected.\n            \n    ",

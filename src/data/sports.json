    "body": "\nThe last chance to join NFL DFS contests for Week 15 comes on 'Monday Night Football' when the Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins at 8:15 p.m. ET. While those in the passing game like Aaron Rodgers, Tua Tagovailoa, D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Waddle will garner lots of interest as NFL DFS picks, both teams rank in the bottom 10 in pass offense. Thus, if you still want to utilize pass catchers from the MNF DFS player pool, perhaps, it would be a better daily Fantasy football strategy to target lower cost receivers as they would be less risky options. Miami tight end Greg Dulcich is averaging 30.8 receiving yards over his last five games, while Pittsburgh's Darnell Washington is averaging 36.5 yards over his last four. In terms of the running game, De'Von Achane (ribs) is cleared to play for the Dolphins, while Pittsburgh has more uncertainty with Jaylen Warren (illness) being added to the injury report on Monday as questionable. Before making any Dolphins vs. Steelers DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Monday Night Football', be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. \nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Dolphins vs. SteelersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Waddle. The fifth-year receiver has upped his production since Tyreek Hill was injured as he's averaged over 70 total yards since Week 5. Waddle had 50 receiving yards, 21 rushing yards and a touchdown a week ago and now gets to face a porous secondary in Pittsburgh. The Steelers have allowed the most catches of any team to opposing wideouts while giving up the second-most receiving yards to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Waddle to go Over 63.5 receiving yards at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Steelers running back Kenneth Gainwell. The former Eagle has become a bigger part of Pittsburgh's offense as of late, averaging 12.3 touches over his last four, after averaging just 5.3 touches over his prior four games. He might see even more work in this one if Warren's illness keeps him out or limits him. Gainwell's made the most of these opportunities as he ranks as the RB9 in Fantasy over the last four weeks. Meanwhile, Miami has the No. 25 run defense, and just four teams are allowing more yards per carry than the Dolphins. Thus, Gainwell has the potential to supply lots of value to your MNF DFS lineups and he won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Gainwell to go Over 28.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Steelers vs. Dolphins DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

The Steelers had lost three of their previous four games and five of their previous seven after starting the season with a 4-1 record, so it was massive for them to get back in the win column ahead of the stretch run.Miami has won four in a row since losing to Baltimore back in Week 9, and is now on the fringes of the playoff race in a season that started off in disastrous fashion. The Dolphins have been running the ball like crazy during their winning streak, while also turning over the opposing team multiple times in each of those games. Will the Steelers make it two in a row, or will the Dolphins pull off the upset to stay alive in the AFC playoff race? We'll find out soon enough. But before we detail some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Steelers vs. DolphinsDate: Monday, Dec. 15 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Acrisure Stadium (Pittsburgh)TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -3, O/U 42.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Steelers battle the Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football.\"Key storylinesAFC North race. Pittsburgh currently holds a half-game lead in the division over the Ravens. The Steelers will maintain their AFC North lead no matter the result of this game by virtue of having defeated Baltimore last week, but it would obviously be beneficial to hold onto the one-game cushion heading into the stretch run. After this game against Miami, the Steelers close out the season with games in Detroit, in Cleveland and then at home against the Ravens. Baltimore closes by hosting New England and then traveling to Green Bay and Pittsburgh.AFC wild card race. The Dolphins are 2.5 games back of the Texans for the No. 7 seed in the AFC and technically still alive in the wild card chase. They're going to need to win out and they'll need to get a whole lot of help from other teams along the way. Following this game against the Steelers, they close the season by hosting the Bengals and Buccaneers and then traveling to New England to take on the Patriots. The Steelers are obviously still alive for a wild card spot as well with their 7-6 record, but they're far more likely to make it by holding off the Ravens in the division race than by sneaking in as a wild card, which by contrast is Miami's only path to the postseason.Revenge games for star DBs. Minkah Fitzpatrick and Jalen Ramsey will each be playing against their former teams in these games after they were involved in a trade for each other this offseason. Fitzpatrick spent five-plus seasons in Pittsburgh after being traded there (by Miami) early in the second year of his NFL career, only to be sent back to the Dolphins this past offseason. Ramsey played two years in Miami before being traded to Pittsburgh. Steelers vs. Dolphins pick, prediction\nDid you know that the Dolphins are 5-1 in their last six games since dropping to 1-6 and looking like their season was done? Mike McDaniel has this team playing really well! They can run on anybody, and we've seen that you can run on the Steelers. (Look at what the Bills did a couple weeks ago.) If they can control the game on the ground, I like their chances to pull off an upset here, considering that the Pittsburgh offense still isn't explosive enough to put an opponent away. \nPick: Miami 21, Pittsburgh 17 | Dolphins +3, Under 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Week 15 in the NFL was certainly a consequential week. The Buffalo Bills made up ground in the AFC East by defeating the New England Patriots, while the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals were eliminated from playoff contention. It was also an unfortunate week for injuries, as Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and Green Bay Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons suffered torn ACLs.The playoff picture is becoming clearer. The Los Angeles Rams look to be the team to beat in the NFL, Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars may be hitting their stride at the right time and Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans breathed a huge sigh of relief when their NFC South rivals, the Carolina Panthers, were upset by the New Orleans Saints on Sunday. There is still plenty of football left to be played, but which teams are the favorites to win it all in what has been a wonky season? Below, we will break down the latest Super Bowl LX odds, courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Super Bowl LX oddsTeamOddsLos Angeles Rams+310Seattle Seahawks+650Denver Broncos+800Buffalo Bills+800Philadelphia Eagles+1100Houston Texans+1100Green Bay Packers+1500New England Patriots+1500Jacksonville Jaguars+1700San Francisco 49ers+2200Los Angeles Chargers+2200Baltimore Ravens+2200Chicago Bears+3000Detroit Lions+3000Tampa Bay Buccaneers+5000Pittsburgh Steelers+7000Carolina Panthers+30000Indianapolis Colts+40000Dallas Cowboys+60000\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture, standings: Steelers remain atop AFC North by eliminating Dolphins on 'MNF'\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNFC West: The division to beat?The Rams should top everyone's power rankings entering Week 16, as they defeated the Lions on Sunday, 41-34. Matthew Stafford and company have put up back-to-back games with 500 total yards and 40 points and have officially clinched a playoff spot. Speaking of Stafford, this man is a monster. He leads the NFL in passing touchdowns (37) and passer rating (112.2). However, it is worth noting that Davante Adams, who leads the NFL with 14 touchdown receptions, left the Lions game with a hamstring injury.It's fairly fascinating that the Seahawks currently have the second-shortest odds to win the Super Bowl. Yes, they have won four straight games, but needed a game-winning field goal to beat a 44-year-old grandfather on Sunday. The issues -- or maybe let's call them inconsistencies -- run deeper.In its eventual 37-9 win over the Atlanta Falcons, Seattle was tied at the halftime break, 6-6. In the 26-0 victory over the Minnesota Vikings in Week 13, the Seahawks offense recorded just 219 total yards. Seattle played the lowly Tennessee Titans close in Week 12, and then of course lost to the Rams in Week 11. Seattle has a chance to change the narrative Thursday against the rival Rams, but it's fair to have questions about this team as legitimate contenders. The Buckin' BroncosHow about this Broncos squad? They are now the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a 12-2 record following the 34-26 win over the Packers, and have officially clinched a playoff spot. Those 12 wins are the most victories Denver has earned since 2015, when it won Super Bowl 50.Bo Nix has caught plenty of flak for his ups and downs this season, but he balled out Sunday with 302 passing yards and four touchdowns. We already know how good this Broncos defense is, as they rank top five in both total defense (287.7 yards allowed per game) and scoring defense (18.6 points allowed per game). With the Chiefs out of the running, are the Broncos the legitimate favorite in the AFC? Vegas believes it's them, or Josh Allen and the Bills. What about the NFC North?Sportsbooks do not trust the NFC North, as Vegas believes a whopping 12 NFL teams have a better chance to win the Super Bowl than the current No. 2-seeded Bears. That includes the No. 7 seed Packers. Chicago has a tough stretch to end the season, as the Bears host the Packers Saturday night, play at the 49ers in Week 17 and then finish the season at home against the desperate Lions. The Bears have recorded double-digit wins for the first time since 2018 and boast the most opportunistic defense in the NFL, which leads the league with 30 takeaways. However, Chicago missed an opportunity to beat the Packers last week. As we mentioned, the Bears get a chance at revenge at home Saturday night. Don't rule out the Lions, sitting at the No. 8 seed with an 8-6 record. They close out the season with the Steelers, Vikings and Bears.SportsLine projections for the NFC NorthTeamChances to win divisionChances to make playoffsBears46.0%80.8%Packers47.7%89.0%Lions6.3%34.6%\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football, their first game back at home since \"fire Mike Tomlin\" chants erupted in a loss to the Buffalo Bills. Numerous players have come to Tomlin's defense since, the latest remarks coming from former Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey, who kept his opinion blunt and to the point over the weekend.\"Me, personally, I thought the chants were bullshit,\" Ramsey said Saturday. \"That's comical in my mind. That's all I'll say about that.\"The Steelers (7-6) face what amounts to a pivotal matchup against the Dolphins to stay in the NFL playoff conversation after a 4-1 start since deteriorated. Pittsburgh traded for Ramsey in July from Miami as part of a multi-player deal that included Minkah Fitzpatrick. Ramsey amassed 41 tackles and an interception for the Steelers so far.The Steelers took sole possession of the AFC North lead after their Week 14 win over the Ravens after Baltimore had caught up with its divisional rival despite a 1-5 start this season.\n\"It's tough, it's the NFL ... any type of success you get, you hang onto it,\" Ramsey said, referencing his seven postseason games in his eight-year career.Tomlin, the NFL's longest-tenured coach, said he understands the frustrations felt by the Pittsburgh faithful.\"In general, I agree with them, from this perspective: Football is our game, we're in a sport entertainment business,\" Tomlin said. \"And so if you root for the Steelers, entertaining them is winning. And so when you're not winning, it's not entertaining.\"\n\"If you've been in this business, you understand that, and so I respect it,\" Tomlin said previously. \"I share frustrations, I understand what makes this thing go, and winning is what makes this thing go.\"Pittsburgh lost its last five playoff games under Tomlin with the Steelers' most recent postseason win coming in the divisional round of the 2016 playoffs. Tomlin is 8-11 overall in the playoffs during his 19-year tenure, a career highlighted the  Super Bowl XLIII victory.Tomlin has yet to deliver a losing season in Pittsburgh.\"I'm a firm believer that if you choose the right people to lead, and you have the right process, you don't have to make changes,\" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. \"Because for the most part, it leads to rebuilding or dysfunction that can kind of break some of the foundational characteristics of winning organizations like the Steelers are.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shopping for the golfer in your life can be a tedious task. Between gag gifts, the ever-evolving nature of golf equipment and a new clothing company popping up every week, the idea of picking the correct present(s) for the upcoming holiday season can sound not only exhausting but intimidating.  That's where we come in. Below are a few favorites the CBS Sports golf team has been perusing and/or throughout 2025. They range from clothing to items that make golf more fun to aids that will help in recovery once the game is over and you're relaing in the clubhouse or at home.The beauty of many of the products listed below is that they are perfect for everyday use, too. Let's dive in.  Drive 5-Pocket Pants ($85 | Under Armour): There is something about golf pants that clothing manufacturers just cannot figure out. While most have fallen short, Under Armour thrives in this space and at a reasonable price point during a time when good deals are hard to come by. The pants are versatile, comfortable and capable when faced with an awkward stance, which, let's be honest, you are going to have at one point in your round.  \nTKO Hoodie ($140 | Zero Restriction): These were available at the Ryder Cup have rarely come off our bodies since. It is just everything one wants in a hoodie -- good for working out, walking around the town, dressy enough for the golf course and plenty cozy to lounge in on those days where a round of golf is not possible. The hood is also the perfect size, and it possesses a nice blend of sturdiness and workability, which somehow seems to always get overlooked in … hoodies. Crazy, right? As the name implies, this is a total knockout.\n                                                                    Zero Restriction\n                                                            The Shaw Crewneck Sweater: Heathered Saffron ($225 | Holderness & Bourne): Professional golfers are begging for more cashmere layering pieces, so enter a cashmere sweater. Boasting a blend of merino wool and cashmere, this sweater from H&B may be the gold standard for a piece that can be worn for 18 holes but also for a date night, drinks with friends or next to a fire reading a book. It is so versatile and timeless -- one of those articles of clothing that does not feel like it was made for golf but rather for your everyday life.  Fender x Teufel Rockster Go 2 speaker ($99.99 | Teufel): Whether you're a serious golfer looking to unwind after the round or one who prefers to have fun on the course, there may be no better way to listen to music on the go than the Rockster 2 Go. This rugged device is impact-resistant, holds up in cold weather and is able to avoid complications from dust or water. The classic Fender design gives it an incredible, enviable look, while Teufel's audio technology brings high-quality sound. With up to 28 hours of battery life, USB-C fast charging and a strap that allows the speaker to be attached to all manner of items, this is great either as a gift or personal purchase.  \nVKTRY Recovery Slides ($79.99 | VKTRY): Any golfer knows how tired their feet can be after playing 18 holes, particularly if walking the entire course. Once you enter the clubhouse and ditch your golf shoes, speed up your recovery with potentially the most comfortable slides on the market. Available in white (pictured) and black in both slide and clog stylings, these shoes feature a three-layer recovery system, including an ultra-cushioned footbed to increase blood flow, a carbon cloud core that aids responsiveness and a contoured sole with an elevated arch that promotes natural movement as you walk.  Chip Shot hoodie / Big Hitter rope hat ($112 / $38 | William Murray): Bill Murray's name has become synonymous with \"fun\" golf over the years, and his clothing line is no exception. The Chip Shot hoodie is basically a golf polo reimagined, wearable as either a light outer layer or underneath a jacket -- plus the sizing is right on, which is not always true about golf gear. Among a few film-related items William Murray has made available is the Big Hitter hat, which as they explain, is \"tailor-made for the 12th son of the Lama\" and guaranteed to bring you a ton of \"gunga-galunga\" energy, whether you're playing on a well-maintained course or at the bottom of a crevice.ColorVision 88 with HD gray lenses ($48 | BluBlocker): If you watched \"Happy Gilmore 2,\" you saw Adam Sandler rocking these throwbacks throughout the film. This reedition of the ultra-popular shades from 1988 is lightweight and comfortable. It offers great surrounding shade, giving your eyes protection wherever you look. The optional polarization with the classic BluBlocker amber lenses is a $20 upgrade and even more vintage look. Whether your friend, co-worker or family member is a casual golfer or a bit more serious, they can benefit from these sunglasses.\nRichard Boxer ($41 | B. Draddy): Probably not what you were expecting while reading a gift guide for golf clothes, but hear us out. There are few things better than playing a round of golf, showering, freshening up and putting on some clean clothes to sit back and relax in while telling friends and family about every single shot you just struck. That has to start somewhere, and that is with boxers. These from B. Draddy are pima cotton, soft as can be and do not have that synthetic material that should be reserved for athletic clothing and some outerwear.   Gamechanger Jogger ($108-$65 | Public Rec): Sick of traditional golf pants? These joggers are buttery soft, extremely versatile and quite stylish, perfect for on or off the course. Their generous stretch material ensures your movement is not restricted, while the midweight fabric will ensure you never get too hot or too cold. These are also terrific travel pants with an elastic waistband, front and back zippers and a faux front fly that allows them to be worn in a variety of places. There are eight different colors available -- three of them on sale for only $65.Be the Ball golf towel ($29 | Par Bleu): Available in a variety of styles and colors, these elevated golf towels are made of a unique microfiber that maintains color and durability in cold or warm washes, the latter of which may be necessary depending how often you find your ball in the sand and muck. This \"Be the Ball\" style stands out as it provides you with a reminder to stay in the moment and focus on the game, blocking outside noise and frustrations from entering your head as you swing.\n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Citizen 24L Messenger bag ($170 | Chrome Industries): A perfect, easily carryable complement to your golf bag, this messenger has so much space you can throw in a laptop, golf shoes, a change of clothes and anything else you might need to make a trek from the office to the course -- or vice versa -- a simple experience. It's available in four colors, including sage (pictured), indigo, black and black XRF, and if 24L is too big for your needs, a 15L version is available, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola plans to enter the transfer portal when it opens on January 2, sources told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Husker fans have been bracing for Raiola's possible departure for weeks. Raiola's brother, Dayton, decommitted from the Huskers at the end of November and Matt Rhule fired offensive line coach Donovan Raiola, Dylan's uncle, shortly after the season ended. Raiola was once a 5-star prospect coming out of high school, and in his time at Nebraska there were glimpses of the brilliant talent that earned him that rating. However, the consistency in production never quite matched up, and now we'll see how he's viewed around the country as he looks to find a new team for his junior season. Raiola was a starter at Nebraska from Day 1 as a true freshman, and in his two years in Lincoln he's started 22 games, completing 69.1% of his passes for 4,819 yards, 31 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. In nine games played in 2025 before suffering a season-ending broken fibula, Raiola showed improvement as a passer, bumping his completion percentage up to 72.4% and cutting down on turnovers with just six interceptions after 11 as a freshman. \nNow he will explore his options and figures to be among the most coveted quarterbacks on the transfer market, which will include other big names like Florida's DJ Lagway, Michigan State's Aidan Chiles, ECU's Katin Houser and Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby, who all indicated their intention to enter the portal on Monday as well.Raiola figures to be looking for somewhere he can raise his profile and seeking a supporting cast around him to help showcase his full talents on a contender. According to Chris Hummer, Oregon is a school expected to show interest in Raiola, which would certainly fit the bill as a place where he can contend and play with a strong supporting cast on offense. The Ducks will likely see Dante Moore head off to the NFL whenever their College Football Playoff run concludes, and Dan Lanning could bring Raiola in as the new starter in Eugene to try and keep Oregon rolling right along. \nRaiola would be a different archetype than we've seen in Lanning's tenure at Oregon. Bo Nix, Dillon Gabriel and Dante Moore have all had slighter frames but were tremendously accurate, allowing the Ducks to stay on schedule and get their playmakers the ball on time and in space. Raiola showed growth in that area with his jump in completion percentage this year at Nebraska, but he also possesses a big frame and strong arm that could provide Oregon with a different dynamic attacking down the field. We'll find out in January whether the Ducks do in fact end up landing Raiola or if he finds a different landing spot, but he figures to be among the most coveted targets for teams in need of a new starter. Nebraska, meanwhile, will have to shift their focus to finding a new quarterback after the Raiola era produced back-to-back 7-win seasons, but the Huskers never quite hit the heights they hoped to when he flipped to Rhule's program from being committed to Georgia. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Coming into it, Week 15 had the potential to be the defining weekend in the NFL and it's living up to that billing. There were several playoff scenarios at play this weekend, and the overall picture is starting to crystallize. One thing that is not wrapped up, however, is the AFC East crown. The New England Patriots had an opportunity to secure the division on Sunday with a win, but the Buffalo Bills rallied from a 21-point deficit to keep those hopes of winning the AFC East alive for at least another week. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Bengals are officially eliminated from the playoffs after the Baltimore Ravens secured a key AFC North win to keep their playoff pursuit going. Maybe the most significant development, however, came at Arrowhead Stadium where the Kansas City Chiefs have been officially eliminated from playoff contention. Moreover, Patrick Mahomes left the contest late in the fourth quarter due to a left knee injury, which has since been revealed to be a torn ACL. The late afternoon window then took the baton from the early slate, and ran with it. The Los Angeles Rams clinched a playoff berth with their win over the Detroit Lions, as did the Denver Broncos after outlasting the Green Bay Packers in a heavyweight showdown from Mile High. Meanwhile, the Carolina Panthers had an opportunity to sit atop the NFC South, but found themselves on the wrong end of the scoreboard with the New Orleans Saints pulling off the upset. \nWith an epic Week 15 slate unfolding before our eyes, now is the perfect time to take a live look at the playoff picture. Below, we'll break down who's currently in and out of the postseason.AFC standingsx-Denver Broncos (12-2)New England Patriots (11-3)Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (8-6)Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Buffalo Bills (10-4)Houston Texans (9-5)x-clinched playoff berth\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (12-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersAfter winning their 11th straight game thanks to a 34-26 victory against the Green Bay Packers, the Broncos are 12-2 and have officially clinched a playoff berth. They have a solid cushion in the AFC West, and have even more breathing room in their pursuit of the No. 1 seed thanks to Buffalo defeating the New England Patriots. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (11-3)Remaining schedule: at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had an opportunity to clinch the AFC East with a win over Buffalo on Sunday, but blew a 21-point lead in Week 15 to snap their winning streak. New England remains in first place in the division, but the Bills are lurking. \nBeyond Buffalo, this loss currently doesn't help the Patriots in their pursuit of Denver for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars have now won five straight games following a blowout victory against the New York Jets. That helps keep them in first place in the AFC South over the surging Houston Texans.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-6)Remaining schedule: at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers remain in sole possession of first place in the AFC North after defeating the Dolphins on \"Monday Night Football,\" but there's still a lot to be determined in this division. It could end up coming down to their Week 18 matchup in Pittsburgh.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers notched their 10th win of the season and eliminated the Kansas City Chiefs from playoff contention on Sunday with a nail-biting win at Arrowhead. That victory not only keeps them as the No. 1 wild card team, but they are still within range of Denver in the AFC West. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Buffalo Bills (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt cannot be overstated how important Buffalo's comeback win over the Patriots was. After erasing another double-digit deficit, the Bills are still alive in the AFC East race, meaning there is still a line to a higher seed and a home playoff game.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (9-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Raiders, at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have clawed back into the playoff picture as the No. 7 seed and are coming off an impressive win over the Cardinals at home. They've now won six straight and are on the heels of the Jaguars in the AFC South, so there is room for this climb to go even higher.\nIn the huntThe Colts (8-6) are mathematically still in the hunt, but have a difficult road forward, especially after being unable to pull off the upset in Seattle. The team that may have the best chance of this group to make the postseason is the Ravens (7-7), especially after shutting out the Bengals to move back to .500 on the year. That keeps them one game behind the Steelers in the AFC North with one more head-to-head still to go in the regular-season finale.NFC standingsx-Los Angeles Rams (11-3)Chicago Bears (10-4)Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)Seattle Seahawks (11-3)San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)x-clinched playoff berth  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (11-3)Remaining schedule: at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams have officially clinched a playoff berth after taking down the Detroit Lions in Week 15. Not only did they punch their ticket to the postseason, but this win helped L.A. keep both the Seahawks and 49ers at arm's length as both NFC West rivals are hot on their heels. Next week's matchup against Seattle will prove to be monumental in securing the division. Right now, however, Sean McVay and Co. are in the driver's seat for the No. 1 seed. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (10-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears have notched double-digit wins on the season after soundly taking down the Cleveland Browns at Soldier Field. Thanks to the Denver Broncos defeating the Packers, Chicago has vaulted back up to first place in the NFC North and are currently the No. 2 seed in the conference. Of course, this puts even more emphasis on what was already a massive matchup with Green Bay next week. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, at Bills, vs. CommandersPhiladelphia snapped a three-game losing streak on Sunday with a blowout win against the Raiders. Jalen Hurts bounced back nicely with three passing touchdowns, and the victory helps the Eagles hold firm atop the NFC East. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersEven after that demoralizing loss to the Falcons on Thursday, the Buccaneers come out of Week 15 in first place in the NFC South. That's thanks to the New Orleans Saints upsetting the Carolina Panthers to push them to 7-7 on the season. Tampa Bay holds the tiebreaker over Carolina at the moment due to a better win percentage against common opponents. However, both head-to-head matchups are still on deck, which will kick off next week in Carolina. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (11-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle barely escaped Week 15 with a win. The club let Philip Rivers hang around just long enough to put the Colts within range of an upset, but a game-winning field goal drive with 18 seconds left in regulation helped secure the win. The Seahawks are now 11-3, which has then neck-and-neck with the Rams for first place in the NFC West. L.A. currently holds the tiebreaker due to a head-to-head win back in Week 11, but these two will square off on Thursday.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe Niners are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race. Despite being the No. 6 seed, San Francisco is 10-4 and ready to pounce if their division rivals slip up down the stretch. The team split the head-to-head series with the Rams, but does currently have the advantage over Seattle, which the 49ers face again in Week 18. There's a world where the 49ers could surprisingly jump much higher in the standings if certain pieces fall their way over the next three weeks. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)Remaining schedule: at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay saw a considerable fall from grace. After coming into Week 15 as the No. 2 seed and in first place in the NFC North, they've suddenly dropped all the way to the No. 7 seed after falling to the Denver Broncos. That defeat helped Chicago move on top of the Packers for first place in the division, which puts an even greater emphasis on next week's matchup. Even worse, pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss due to a serious knee injury. Because Green Bay swept the season series over the Lions, the Packers have some wiggle room to play with before falling out of the playoff picture entirely. In the huntThe Lions (8-6) have their backs against the wall a bit after falling to the Los Angeles Rams. That defeat continues to keep them on the outside looking in on the playoff picture as the No. 8 seed as they are in third place in the NFC North. They aren't out of the race quite yet, but they certainly need to win out and get some help along the way. \nThe Carolina Panthers (7-7) had a golden opportunity to create some space between them and the Buccaneers for first place in the NFC South, simply needing a win over the Saints to move to 8-6, while Tampa Bay stumbled to 7-7 with a loss to Atlanta on Thursday. However, the Panthers allowed New Orleans to pull off the upset, which sent them back to .500 on the season. Because they're knotted with Bucs, they lose the tiebreaker due to an inferior record against common opponents. Of course, the Panthers can get back into it with two of their remaining three games on the season against Tampa.  The Cowboys (6-7-1) are on life support after losing to the Vikings on Sunday night, all but ending any hopes of securing a postseason berth. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a flurry of movement Monday morning, five different high-level quarterbacks announced their intention to go in the college football transfer portal. Former five-stars Dylan Raiola and DJ Lagway left Nebraska and Florida, respectively, after two seasons. Aidan Chiles, a former top 60 recruit, opted to depart Michigan State. East Carolina QB Katin Houser decided to make a run back to the Power Four following a breakout season. All the while, the portal has new No. 1 player according to Cooper Petagna's big board at 247Sports: Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby, who hopped back into the portal ahead of his final season of college football. It was all a bit dizzying. The portal doesn't open for another three weeks, and there are still many high-profile moves expected to occur both within in the quarterback market and apart from it. With that in mind, let's reset the quarterback landscape, highlighting some of the big names, schools to watch and names we still have on the radar ahead of Jan. 2.\nThe names atop the QB market No. 1 Brendan Sorsby, Cincinnati: Sorsby finished the year ranked 10th in ESPN's QBR metric, emerging as one of the truly elite passers in the sport. The two early schools to watch with Sorsby are Indiana and Texas Tech. The Hoosiers are a bit ironic given that's where Sorsby started his career, exiting Bloomington shortly after Curt Cignetti arrived. The Red Raiders are the local school to have on the radar -- if you consider 300 miles of West Texas driving local -- and seem to be a strong on-paper fit for the junior passer. Of note with Sorsby: Sources have indicated he still plans to consider the NFL Draft. But those are two schools to know if he does opt to stay in school. No. 2 Dylan Raiola, Nebraska: It probably is unsurprising to see Raiola's name listed here given the lead up the last few weeks. His brother decommitted from Nebraska. The school fired his uncle Donovan, the offensive line coach. CBS Sports reported the split was likely. But the end of the Raiola and Nebraska partnership is still interesting given how much the two sides had invested in each other, including a $3.5 million rev share/NIL package for Raiola. As for what's next, an early school to keep an eye on is Oregon. The Raiola camp has interest in the Ducks, per sources, and there is a growing industry thought that Oregon QB Dante Moore will end up testing the NFL Draft waters.No. 3 DJ Lagway, Florida: Unlike the above two situations that had been trending toward a breakup for weeks, the divorce between Lagway and Florida came as somewhat of a surprise Monday. Lagway only decided in recent days he'd move on after his initial meetings with the new Florida staff went poorly, per sources. As for what's next for the former No. 1 QB prospect in the 2024 class, schools like Baylor, Florida State and Duke (depending on what happens with Darian Mensah) have been brought up per sources along with those like Clemson, LSU and Miami. Of note, Lagway's dad played at Baylor.\n\n        \n            \n                Where will DJ Lagway transfer? Departing Florida QB's possible destinations include LSU, Miami, Clemson\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOthers we're watchingSam Leavitt, QB, Arizona State: Industry sources have pointed at Leavitt for months as someone who could enter the transfer portal. That seems like a formality at this point after he didn't attend Arizona State's year-end banquet and head coach Kenny Dillingham wished him well \"in whatever his future may hold,\" per 247Sports' Chris Karpman. CJ Bailey, QB, NC State: A star sophomore with the Wolfpack, Bailey is a popular rumor for other teams in terms of potential portal candidates. Dave Doeren coming back aids NC State's chances of keeping Bailey around, but he remains a very hot name in terms of other programs looking at the quarterback market. Byrum Brown, QB, South Florida: It raised some eyebrows in the industry when Brown opted out of the Cure Bowl. Brown is a senior, but he's pursing a waiver that is expected to go through. If it does … several schools in the industry are watching Brown and his status. There would be a natural fit at Auburn, where his former South Florida head coach Alex Golseh resides. \nDrew Mestemaker, QB, North Texas: A breakout star as a redshirt freshman this season, Mestemaker led the FBS with 4,129 passing yards to go along with 31 touchdowns on 70.2% passing. He's been a name other schools have eyed for months. It's natural to assume that he'll follow Eric Morris to Oklahoma State. But Mestemaker is expected to have robust options. There are several other QBs worth watching over the coming month. Some notable backups like Ohio State's Lincoln Kienholz and Oregon's Austin Novasad have decisions to make. There are other very productive Group of Five QBs like Arkansas State's Jaylen Raynor or Parker Navarro from Ohio worth keeping track of. There are also a few more established starters who could shake if things become further unsettled at their current situations. The news keeps coming with three weeks to go. Don't expect it to stop anytime soon. \nNorth Texas' Drew Mestemaker is expected to among the most coveted quarterbacks in the transfer portal. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Teams in needMiami: The Hurricanes are likely to dip into the portal for a third straight offseason in pursuit of a quarterback with Carson Beck's impending graduation. Though, there is some internal optimism about the development of Emory Williams.Texas Tech: The Red Raiders love backup quarterback Will Hammond, but he tore his ACL in late October. Given that there's no guarantee of him being ready for next season, Texas Tech is expected to go after a starter-quality passer in the portal. Money tends to be no object in Lubbock.Indiana: Indiana's made the playoff in back-to-back years with a transfer quarterback, and it will try to do so a third time in 2026. Expect Indiana to go and get a guy to replace Fernando Mendoza.\nLSU: Could it just end up being Trinidad Chambliss? That's certainly possible if he can secure a waiver. Either way, the Tigers are expected to be in the portal market for a high-level starter, and Lane Kiffin makes the Tigers a super attractive option.Florida State: There had been some thought that Tommy Castellanos could qualify for an additional season of college football via a waiver. It could still happen, but there's a good chance of Florida State hopping into the high-end portal quarterback market either way.That top of the market could grow, too, depending on a few big quarterback decisions. Oregon quarterback Dante Moore could end up going to the draft which would mean Oregon jumping into the fray. The tenor around his situation has shifted in recent weeks with industry sources now considering the NFL a more likely option for Moore.\nAuburn will have a decision to make about its 2026 signal-caller. Deuce Knight is a potential superstar and seems to be an ideal on-paper fit for Golesh's system. Knight has also started just one game. I would expect the Tigers to pursue an experienced option.Clemson, believe it or not, is also a team to watch in the quarterback market. The Tigers have indicated to agents that quarterback is a potential need this cycle as they replace Cade Klubnik. Whether that's a high-end starter or someone to compete with Christopher Vizzina remains to be seen.There are also a lot of other teams expected to go get a guy. Illinois, Virginia Tech, Louisville and Baylor will all likely need starting arms, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        Florida quarterback DJ Lagway is on the move. The former five-star prospect and sophomore intends to enter the transfer portal when it opens ",
    "body": "\n        Florida quarterback DJ Lagway is on the move. The former five-star prospect and sophomore intends to enter the transfer portal when it opens in January, ending a brief but impactful stint with the Gators. Lagway arrived as one of the highest-rated recruits of the Billy Napier era and quickly made a name for himself with a breakout true freshman season in 2024. Injuries and a coaching change slowed his development this past year, and sources told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer that Lagway ultimately decided the new staff and program direction did not match his vision.Lagway's profile makes him one of the most intriguing quarterbacks on the market: a physically gifted, dual-threat talent with first-round NFL Draft upside. Teams in need of an immediate starter and a dynamic playmaker will likely circle him, weighing both his potential and the risks that come with a recent injury-affected season.Early indications suggest a wide array of programs could be in play for the former No. 1 quarterback prospect in the 2024 class.\n\n    \n                                        \n    BaylorBaylor makes sense as a homecoming option for Lagway, with the Bears located a little more than two hours from his hometown of Willis, Texas. Baylor did offer during Lagway's high school recruitment, and a return to the Lone Star State could appeal to a quarterback looking for familiarity after two seasons in Gainesville. There is also a family tie, as Lagway's father played at Baylor. While the Bears' staff looks different now -- with primary recruiters Shawn Bell and Jeff Grimes no longer in Waco -- the program still presents a clear opportunity at the position.Sawyer Robertson wrapped up his career as one of the most productive quarterbacks in Baylor history, finishing top five in career and single-season records for passing yards as well as passing touchdowns while serving as the full-time starter over the past two seasons. That production leaves a significant opening moving forward, and offensive coordinator Jake Spavital, entering his third year with the Bears, could offer Lagway a system built to maximize his dual-threat skill set. \n    \n                                        \n    DukeThe Blue Devils could be an option, but it hinges almost entirely on Darian Mensah's future. Mensah signed a lucrative NIL deal believed to be worth $8 million over two seasons, yet his on-field production in 2025 -- 30 touchdown passes against five interceptions while leading Duke to an ACC title -- has put him squarely on the radar as a potential 2026 NFL Draft entrant.\nWhile there's been purely outside speculation about Mensah reuniting with former Tulane coach Jon Sumrall at Florida, there's been no indication he plans to transfer. If Mensah does declare early, however, Duke would be left with a significant vacancy at quarterback, creating a clear path for Lagway to step into a proven ACC offense.\n    \n                                        \n    Florida StateFrom Gainesville to Tallahassee? That would be a headline-grabbing move, given the rarity -- though growing frequency -- of high-profile transfers crossing rivalry lines. Lagway went 2-0 against the Seminoles during his time at Florida, completing 29 of 46 passes for 301 yards with five touchdowns and two interceptions, and would arrive in Tallahassee with proven familiarity against the program. With the NCAA recently denying Tommy Castellanos an additional year of eligibility, Mike Norvell could be motivated to pursue a splash addition at quarterback rather than turning the offense over to younger, unproven options in Brock Glenn or Kevin Sperry, making Lagway a bold but logical target if Florida State prioritizes immediate experience at the position.\n    \n                                        \n    ClemsonClemson represents a familiar name in Lagway's recruiting story, as the Tigers made a late push to flip him from Florida just days before the December signing period in 2023. Clemson was among his finalists before he ultimately committed to the Gators, and the program now finds itself in need of a quarterback following three-year starter Cade Klubnik exhausting his eligibility. Backup Christopher Vizzina enters his fourth year after seeing limited action, including just one start -- a loss to SMU -- leaving an opening for a transfer to step into a program accustomed to competing at the ACC's highest level.\n\n    \n                                        \n    LSULSU could be an intriguing landing spot as new coach Lane Kiffin looks for his next quarterback in Baton Rouge. While Lagway's five-interception outing against the Tigers this season is one to forget, he did lead Florida to a win over Kiffin's Rebels in 2024 during a four-game end-of-season streak, showing he can perform in high-pressure SEC matchups. Kiffin even shared a social media post Monday acknowledging Lagway's decision to enter the transfer portal, so take that for what it's worth.\n    \n                                        \n    MiamiThe Hurricanes present another in-state rivalry option, with Miami set to enter the offseason with a quarterback vacancy again. The program has a strong recent track record of elevating transfer signal-callers into high-level talent -- Cam Ward became the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, while Carson Beck has emerged with renewed confidence leading Miami to its first College Football Playoff appearance. Lagway could step into a program built to elevate experienced quarterbacks and recapture that status as a former five-star prospect.\n    \n                                        \n    Texas TechThe Red Raiders have built a reputation as big spenders in the transfer portal, turning those moves into a Big 12 title and a first-round bye in the CFP. While the program remains confident in redshirt freshman Will Hammond -- who saw action in eight games and made two starts for an injured Behren Morton before tearing his ACL against Oklahoma State in October -- the injury clouds Texas Tech's quarterback plans moving forward. That uncertainty could open the door for Lagway to step in and compete for the starting role immediately.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League season will be back in 2026 after six matchdays of the league phase took place from September to December 2025, but the top European leagues aren't going on break in the meanwhile. Arsenal and Manchester City are ready to fight for another Premier League title while Bayern Munich are once again dominating the Bundesliga standings. Elsewhere, Real Madrid are struggling and there is increasing pressure on the position of the manager Xabi Alonso, while Hansi Flick's Barcelona look strong. Let's take a look our Power Rankings: 1. Arsenal (--)It was a challenging weekend for the side coached by Mikel Arteta, as Arsenal won 2-1 thanks to two owngoals scored by Wolverhampton, with the winning one in the last minute of stoppage time. Arsenal remain top of the Premier League, holding a two-point lead over Manchester City, and after their 3–0 win against Club Brugge last week, they are the only team to have already secured a top-eight finish and a place in the Champions League knockout stages. 2. Bayern Munich (--)If there is one team still chasing Arsenal, that's Bayern Munich. The German giants won 3-1 against Sporting CP in the last Champions League's matchday and are dominating the league. Also, they've got a new talent who is shining and showing to be among the best around the world: Lennart Karl, one to watch also for the upcoming 2026 World Cup. 3. Barcelona (--)Barcelona drastically improved in the last month and are coming from a strong week with two wins against Eintracht Frankfurt and Osasuna on Saturday, consolidating their LaLiga advantage on Real Madrid. Hansi Flick is also welcoming some of his biggest stars back in the team after their injuries and this is only helping Barcelona to be considered as one of the best teams around Europe and a solid Champions League contender. \n4. Manchester City (+1)We all thought this wasn't a great season for Manchester City after a difficult start. Well, we should have waited a bit more. Pep Guardiola's team are only two points behind Arsenal in the league and well positioned to end up in the top eight of the Champions League standings. Erling Haaland scores in every single match, but that's not news really. 5. PSG (-1)The Champions League title holders look less solid than the past season when they dominated both in France and Europe, but at the end of the day despite some big injuries they are still there competing for a spot in the top eight and one point behind Lens in Ligue 1. The feeling is that their condition will only improve from now on and that they can become a factor in both competitions in the coming weeks. 6. Inter (--)The Nerazzurri have been quite disappointing in their last two Champions League matches, losing to both Atletico Madrid and Liverpool after winning their opening four games in the league phase. This season, they have struggled against top opponents, and that is not an encouraging sign heading into the knockout stages, but they are now back at the top of the Serie A standings after the results of the past weekend. \n7. Atletico Madrid (+1)The Spanish giants are back on track. After losing two matches in a row against Barcelona and Athletic Club, the team coached by Diego Simeone won two matches in a row against PSV away and then at their home stadium against Valencia and are now close to the top four in LaLiga standings and then eyeing the top eight of the Champions League standings. 8. Chelsea (-1)Enzo Maresca's team has only won two of the last five Premier League matches and the Italian manager showed some frustration in the post match press conference of their game against Everton, hinting that there might be some disagreements with the owners. This is worth keeping in mind over the coming weeks, especially as the season is progressing strongly in both domestic and European competitions.\n        \n            \n                EFL Carabao Cup burning questions: Why is Enzo Maresca unhappy at Chelsea and can beating Cardiff fix it?\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n9. Real Madrid (--)What is going on at Real Madrid? Things look a bit better for Xabi Alonso after the Spanish giants won against Alaves over the weekend but it's still a difficult moment for the Blancos and the coach, who is facing a big pressure after some disappointing results, including the 2-1 defeat against Manchester City. \n10. Liverpool (+1)Mo Salah left Liverpool and joined Egypt as the African team will be playing in AFCON later this month. This is going to be a key month for the future of the Liverpool star as he might leave in the January transfer window. On the other hand, the two wins against Inter away and then at Anfield against Brighton cleared the air around the position of Arne Slot, who can count on the trust of both the team and the fanbase again. 11. Atalanta (+7)Atalanta are by far the team that improved the most recently as they look completely different since Raffaele Palladino replaced Ivan Tudor on the bench. The home win against Chelsea last week clearly showed that this team can compete with Europe's elite, and Palladino could realistically guide them into the top eight of the league phase. In Serie A, Atalanta are improving and gradually returning to the level they belong to, even if they will likely need a bit more time to fully settle.12. Newcastle (-2)Things look completely different for Newcastle compared to the past season and the latest 1-0 defeat in the Derby against Sunderland showed that this is not a great season so far for them. They can still, and they should, make it into the next phase but they don't look as strong as before. \n13. Olympique Marseille (--)The side coached by Roberto De Zerbi is doing great this season and the last two Champions League wins put them in a strong place ahead of the next phase. Watch out for them, they are not only exciting to watch but also a team that can put others in trouble in Europe. In the French league they are only five points behind Lens, and four behind PSG. 14. Galatasaray (-2)The last two defeats in the Champions League against Union SG and AS Monaco showed that they are not living their best moment, but with so much talent I can still see them to be a challenging outsider when a team will visit team in the playoffs in February in front of their home fans. 15. Borussia Dortmund (--)The home draw against Bodo/Glimt was a bit disappointing for the 2024 Champions League finalists, but at the same time they are where we could expect them to be: middle of the table with high chances to end up in the top 16. \n16. Tottenham (-1)They look better in Europe than in the Premier League where Thomas Frank's team has only won one of the last five matches and already lost six games in 16 matches so far. It seems that what happened last season wasn't a coincidence and it will take more time to see if Frank will be the coach able to turn things around. 17. Sporting CP (--)The Portuguese team are challenging Porto at the top of the domestic league and hoping to land in the playoffs of the Champions League. We could expect them to lose at Bayern Munich and the next two games against PSG and Athletic Club will tell us more about their European expectations. 18. Bayer Leverkusen (+1)The home draw against Newcastle slowed down their chances to end up in the top 16, which would mean playing at home in the second leg of the Champions League playoffs, but it's not over yet. \n19. Juventus (+1)Looks like Luciano Spalletti found a way to improve his team. They are still struggling despite the positive results against Pafos in Europe and then an away win against Bologna over the weekend, but things look much better compared to some weeks ago. Finally, it seems Juventus are getting back on track20. Napoli (-4)Antonio Conte is in trouble, once again. Injuries are definitely having an impact on the performances, but the Champions League defeat against Benfica could really cost them a lot. They are at risk to not end up in the top 24 and being eliminated in the league phase. Not good. 21. PSV (+1)The Dutch side are dominating the league with 14 wins in 16 matches and are in the race to end up in the league phase's top 24 right now. Their only two wins in Europe this season? A stunning 4-1 win at Liverpool away and a dominant 6-2 rout of Napoli at home. They perform best when facing the big teams\n22. AS Monaco (-1)They are struggling this season in both European and domestic leagues, but with their only one defeat in the Champions League they are still in the race for a playoff spot. 23. Club Brugge (--)They have the talent needed, but it doesn't seem to be enough for this season. After winning their first home game of the league phase, they lost twice, drew 3-3 against Barcelona, then lost 3-0 to both Sporting CP and Arsenal in the last matchday last week. 24. Benfica (+5)Can Jose Mourinho make it? I didn't think so before their exciting 2-0 win against Napoli. They are doing much better right now and they still have a chance. I believe in the Special One! \n25. Copenaghen (--)I didn't think they had a chance to qualify for the next round but the 3-2 away win against Villarreal completely changed their look in the standings. 26. Qarabag (-1)A strong start for them, we all hoped they could be a great story, but maybe we overestimated them. Losing to Ajax at home is quiet surprising this season. 27. Eintracht Frankfurt (-1)Last week I wrote that the Barcelona away match was their last chance for the playoffs and they lost. This is probably the end of their dreams but it's over when is over. \n28. Union Saint-Gilloise (+1)The latest home defeat against Olympique Marseille wasn't what they needed to have some qualification hope.29. Athletic Club (-2)I have to be honest. I was expecting a lot from this team this season in the Champions League and if I'm not wrong I even put them as a surprise in our preview of the tournament. I'm afraid I was wrong! 30. Villarreal (-1)They are probably the biggest surprise in LaLiga, sitting third behind Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, but a disaster in the Champions League. I can't find an explanation: Can someone help me? 31. Pafos (--)The team from Cyprus are doing more than we could expect and they are in 26th place after their first historic Champions League win against Villarreal, but then lost to Juventus in the last matchday of 2025. 32. Slavia Prague (--)Sadly, they don't seem to be at the level of the other teams in the tournament but we could see that coming. This is not a surprise to be honest.  33. Olympiacos (--)They finally won their first Champions League match of the season away against Kairat. Too late and not enough. 34. Bodo/Glimt (--) One point behind from the leaders in the Norwegian league standings but basically no hopes in Europe despite an exciting away draw in Germany against Borussia Dortmund. One to remember. 35. Ajax (+1)Big news: Ajax are not in the last spot of our power rankings anymore thanks to their first win against Qarabag. How exciting! 36. Kairat (-1)Just competing in the Champions League is already a historic achievement for the club. We still love them. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        You wouldn't think the Super Bowl race could get any more wide open than it already was … then Week 15 happened.The Chiefs and Bengals were both eliminated, meaning the AFC won't have to go through Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow. That was looking like a formality but I'm sure the rest of the conference is still relieved and believing that anyone can make the Super Bowl now.Then, just when it looked like two teams (Rams and Packers) were starting to separate themselves in the NFC, they lose two of their star players. Micah Parsons' season is over with a torn ACL, while Davante Adams aggravated a hamstring injury that puts his status in doubt for a crucial matchup vs. the Seahawks on Thursday that could ultimately decide the No. 1 seed in the NFC.Rams still the favorite, but NFC just got really interestingI still like the Rams to win the NFC but if anything was going to throw them off it'd be an injury to one of their stars on offense. Adams' injury doesn't look to be season ending and he was optimistic after the game, but the severity is still unknown. Even missing one game could be detrimental to the Rams' Super Bowl hopes, and it's hard to imagine him being ready on a short week after how he went down on Sunday. \nThe Rams face the Seahawks on Thursday in Seattle and the winner of that game will be in the driver's seat for the top seed in the NFC. The Rams may have beaten the Seahawks earlier this season, but Adams scored a touchdown in that game and they only won by two despite Sam Darnold's horrific four-interception performance.Adams may not be a WR1 anymore but he's helped elevate Matthew Stafford to an MVP level and he's been a major nightmare for opposing defenses in the red zone. The Rams lead the NFL in offensive efficiency (+8.4 offensive EPA per game) and are third in the NFL in red zone touchdown percentage this season (67%) after ranking 13th and 25th, respectively, in those categories last season.Adams deserves a lot of credit. He has 11 touchdown catches since Week 7, and nine of them have been on plays inside the opponent's five yard line. He's caught nine of 12 targets for nine touchdowns inside the five in that span. Somehow Stafford to Adams has become as reliable as the Tush Push in short-yardage spots. No other NFL player has more than four catches in that area since Week 7. \nWith Stafford's ball placement and Adam's combination of size and footwork he's helped the Rams cash in on their scoring opportunities. He put Riq Woolen on skates with this slant route for a 1-yard score vs. Seattle earlier this year. \nHe caught a fade here vs. the Buccaneers. Adams' nine touchdowns in goal-to-go situations are only surpassed by one other player since 2000. It was Adams in 2020 when he had 12.\nWhile Adams could miss an extended period of time and the injury is obviously not ideal, there's several reasons to believe they could weather the storm. The Rams beat the Jaguars 35-7 in Week 7, their only game without Puka Nacua this season. They are extremely balanced and the only team that ranks top five in the NFL in offensive and defensive efficiency. \nThe Rams have used 13 personnel (one running, three tight ends) more than twice as much as any other team in the NFL since Nacua was hurt in Week 7 (41%). The recent switch to this personnel is another reason to believe they can manage without Adams for now. The Rams are averaging an NFL-high 35.0 PPG since they started using this heavy personnel in Week 7. They are still averaging a ridiculous 6.3 yards per play in those groups. They rank second in the NFL pass success rate (63%) and rush success rate (50%) vs. base defenses in that span so that personnel is allowing Stafford to pick apart mismatches while they are still running the ball effectively.The Rams run game looks poised to carry more of that burden, too. They rank top four in the NFL in rushing (186.7 yards per game) and yards per rush (6.5) in the past three weeks with the emergence of Blake Corum in the backfield with Kyren Williams. They are the only duo in at least the last 90 seasons with 70+ rushing yards and a rushing touchdown a piece in three straight games.Of course, the door is more open for almost everyone else in the NFC should this slow the Rams down. The Seahawks are the biggest beneficiary. They control their own destiny in the NFC and they'll take any edge they can get when they host the Rams in three days. \nThe Eagles, Bears and 49ers have to feel like they have a chance, too. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 overreactions: Micah Parsons injury ends Packers' Super Bowl hopes?

I would argue they were the second best team in the NFC, until they weren't. Everything was looking up for the Packers midway through Sunday's game until all of the air came out of the balloon and a potential dream season turned to a nightmare. The Packers were up 23-14 in the third quarter when Jordan Love's interception cost Green Bay the ball and his top weapon as Christian Watson left the game with a chest injury and did not return. Later in the quarter Parsons suffered his season-ending torn ACL. The Packers got dominated the rest of the way and fell from the No. 2 seed to the No. 7 seed in the NFC. They were on the verge of beating a playoff-caliber team in three straight games (Lions, Bears, Broncos) and looking like they had as good of a case as anyone to win Super Bowl LX. Now, Green Bay looks destined to go one-and-done again. This was a team that was 0-7 vs. 11+ win teams in 2024 when they did not have Parsons. They made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history and traded two first-round picks for the generational talent to put them over the top in the postseason and in games like Sunday's. Then, in the blink of an eye, those hopes evaporated. You could argue they could bounce back from this. The 49ers have grinded out wins without Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, after all. That's also a highly motivated team coming off a Super Bowl hangover season with an easy schedule. The 49ers have also gone from 13th to last in the NFL in pressure rate since Bosa's injury. I don't see how the Packers rebound from this crushing loss in the stretch run of the season.\nThat's the task though and they'll barely have time to lick their wounds as they play the Bears at Soldier Field on Saturday night with the NFC North on the line. The Bears now have the edge in the division given these injuries and how they just played the Packers in Green Bay. Parsons may have gotten off a slow start with the Packers after his contract dispute with Dallas and a back injury this offseason but he was still having a dominant season. He became the first player in NFL history with 12+ sacks in each of his first five seasons. He ranks second in the NFL in pressure rate this year (20%)  and he led the NFL in that category since Week 10 (23%), which included a game with seven pressures vs. the Bears in Week 14. His absence could help put Chicago over the top. Caleb Williams has the lowest completion percentage (38%) in the NFL vs. pressure this season. Just as the Cowboys defense has struggled all season without Parsons, it's hard to imagine Green Bay won't take a step back here, too. Don't overlook Watson's injury, either. The Packers reportedly got some good news on his injury but it's unclear whether he will miss time. His reemergence elevated Green Bay to a top-flight offense as he ranked sixth in the NFL in yards per route (2.64) in the past five weeks behind Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, CeeDee Lamb, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Nico Collins (minimum 100 routes). He's added an element of explosiveness back into the passing game evidenced by two touchdowns vs. the Bears in Week 14. All of a sudden, Green Bay could be without two of its most important players in a game that will probably decide the division in Week 16.The 49ers have a path to the one seed in the NFCThe biggest winner in the NFC besides the Seahawks is the 49ers. Besides finally having another NFC contender share in their injury misery, San Francisco's surprising path to the top seed in the NFC just got intriguing. The 49ers are 10-4 and will be the top seed in the conference if they win out and the Seahawks beat the Rams on Thursday.\nThe 49ers final three games are at the Colts and then at home vs. the Bears and Seahawks. If they win out they'll finish the year 13-4 with a 5-1 division record, including 3-1 vs. the Rams and Seahawks. That would give them any tiebreaker over their NFC West rivals if Seattle beats Los Angeles on Thursday. A 49ers win in Week 16 vs. the Bears would also mean no other NFC team can get to 13 wins.The 49ers have been flying under the radar all season as they've played the second-easiest schedule in the NFC (only the Bears is easier). I've written them of myself after Brock Purdy threw three interceptions on Monday night vs. the Panthers. Especially since they already have a defense that's last in the NFL in sacks and without Bosa and Warner. But, this is a very well coached team with Robert Saleh back in the fold and Christian McCaffrey is having a spectacular season. If they can beat the odds and steal the top seed after Rams and Packers losses, who's to say they couldn't ride home-field advantage to Super Bowl LX, which will be at their home stadium. That would be an incredible story that went from impossible to improbable after these injuries. There's also speculation that Warner could be aiming to make a return should the 49ers make a deep playoff run, although that still seems unlikely.\nAdd to the list of many intriguing storylines in a wide-open Super Bowl race that just got even more interesting among NFC contenders of injuries to superstars around the league.\n            ",

The RedHawks had their five-game winning streak snapped in a 24-20 loss at Ohio last week, but that setback came on the road. Toledo has been far more inconsistent this season, alternating between wins and losses in seven straight games. The Rockets have lost all four of their road games, so the model has Miami (OH) covering as a home underdog in 62% of simulations. Back the RedHawks at FanDuel Sportsbook:Pistons -2.5 vs. Bulls (-108)\"Not a bad price here on the Pistons, who are demonstrating an admirable \"refuse to lose\" mode after stretching the current win streak to seven with a wild comeback win in OT over the Wiz on Monday,\" SportsLine NBA expert Bruce Marshall said. \"CJ McCollum (42 points) almost pushed Washington across the line himself, but Cade Cunningham's 46 points saved the night for Detroit. Here's also a chance for the Pistons to avenge an opening-night loss at United Center when almost rallying from a 23-point deficit. Now Detroit catches Chicago on a three-game skid as the schedule has ramped up, and top scorer Josh Giddey (ankle) is iffy after missing Monday's loss to the Spurs. Play Pistons.\"\nThunder -7 vs. Lakers (-110)Oklahoma City has wasted no time putting the league on notice again this season, backing up its championship with an 11-1 start to the campaign. Each of the last six wins have come by at least 14 points, including a 126-102 win over Golden State on Tuesday night. Reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is averaging 32.8 points and 6.4 assists per game, while Chet Holmgren is adding 19.6 points and 8.9 rebounds. Without LeBron James, the model does not think the Lakers have enough firepower to keep pace on Wednesday night, as Oklahoma City is covering in 67% of simulations. Back Oklahoma City at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college football and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Wednesday.

And that's the case once again on Saturday when UFC makes its annual trip to Madison Square Garden for UFC 322. A pair of superfights tip the bill with (now) former champions moving up in weight in pursuit of glory in a second division. In the main event, Islam Makhachev moves up from lightweight to welterweight to challenge Jack Della Maddalena for the 170-pound title. In the co-main, Weili Zhang moves from strawweight to flyweight to face Valentina Shevchenko for the 125-pound crown.Technically, champion vs. champion super fights are a thing of the past because UFC CEO Dana White's new philosophy requires champions to vacate their titles before changing divisions. That's exactly what happened with Makhachev and Zhang, who relinquished their UFC titles to move up in weight and become two-division champions. Makhachev (27-1) set the record for most UFC lightweight title defenses, eclipsing mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and others, before moving up to challenge Jack Della Maddalena in the latter's first title defense. Della Maddalena inspired some confidence that he can give Makhachev a tough fight after busting up Belal Muhammad to become the 170-pound champion.Zhang Weili dominated women's strawweight before leaving Mackenzie Dern to pick up the vacant strap at UFC 321. Her second reign as champion saw her beat Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Tatiana Suarez. Now she seeks to put an end to Shevchenko's second women's flyweight title reign, which Shevchenko kick-started after ending her series with former champ Alexa Grasso.\nThe undercard is loaded with fun fights to get fans excited in New York. Rising welterweights Sean Brady and Michael Morales collide in a featured bout that could set the winner up for a shot at the title soon. The same could be said for the winner of Carlos Prates vs. former titleholder Leon Edwards in another featured bout at welterweight. Plus, veterans Beneil Dariush and Benoit Saint-Denis link up in a lightweight battle that could produce fireworks.Below is the complete fight card for UFC 322, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame star Hannah Hidalgo set a new program scoring record during Wednesday's 85-58 win over Akron with 44 points. In the process, she also set a new NCAA Division I single-game record with 16 steals. Her entire stat line was impressive as she shot an efficient 64% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. She neared a triple-double with nine rebounds, while also sprinkling in four assists. The previous Notre Dame record was 41 points, held by now-WNBA star Jewell Loyd and Ruth Riley, who won a national championship with the Fighting Irish in 2001.\"I mean, it's really special, but I got to give all glory to God that put the power in me to be able to do what I do,\" Hidalgo said during her broadcast postgame interview. \"And especially thanks to my teammates. Without them I wouldn't be able to do anything.\"\nThere are not many players at any level who can do what Hidalgo achieved on Wednesday. No NBA or WNBA player has ever registered 40+ points and 10+ steals in a single game. The last college basketball player to do so was Amy Patton for Northern Arizona in 2012.\nHidalgo is a true two-way player and although her scoring ability is impressive, she says it all starts on the other side of the court.\"Defense first, defense wins championships,\" she said. \"I make sure that I bring the energy from my team defensively so that we can get on transition and get buckets.\"The crowd at Purcell Pavilion cheered loudly for her after the game while her teammates surrounded her. This is a rebuilding year for the program, but Hidalgo has so far led Notre Dame to a 3-0 start. \nShe is one of three returning players from last season's roster, along with Cassandre Prosper and KK Bransford. Although there are a lot of new faces in South Bend, Hidalgo said she is having a lot of fun with this group. \"Oh, my goodness. I love my team, everybody. On the court, off the court,\" she said. \"I love playing with them.  There's nobody else I'd rather play with. It's just been so fun, from summer time till now.\"Hidalgo and the rest of the Fighting Irish can use this win to build confidence ahead of their first ranked opponent of the season. No. 18 Notre Dame will take on No. 16 Michigan on the road on Saturday afternoon. The game is set for 4 p.m. ET on NBC Sports.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        I want to draw your attention to an incredible sequence late in the Golden State Warriors' 125-120 victory over the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night. The Warriors ran a high pick-and-roll near mid-court to give Stephen Curry a chance to go downhill at Victor Wembanyama with a full head of steam. Curry snaked around the screen, started driving to his left, then crossed over between his legs on a dime to go right instead. Curry's quick change of direction fooled the Frenchman. Wembanyama was still shifting toward the middle of the floor, and Curry attacked his front foot. It was technically perfect from Curry, and at that moment he should have had a major advantage. And against almost every other big man in the league, he would have. Curry briefly had Wembanyama on skates, but still couldn't gain an advantage But Curry didn't even bother to continue his drive and attack the rim, in part because Luke Kornet was already standing under the rim. Instead he darted backward, and tried to slip Wembanyama with another change of pace move. It didn't work, so he gave up the ball and forced Wembanyama to chase him around the perimeter. \nAgain, this should have worked. Seven-foot-four players are not supposed to be able to keep up with Curry's off-ball movement, but that's just what Wembanyama did. He then cut off another Curry drive with the help of Devin Vassell, which left Draymond Green open in the lane. Wembanyama rushed back to stifle Green, who kicked the ball out to Gary Payton II. The lefty guard drove at Kornet's closeout and thought he had a layup, but Wembanyama was there again to force a miss. As Wembanyama sprinted down the other end of the floor, he caught a pass from Stephon Castle, and had a chance to go at Green in the open court. He crossed over, drove into the paint, got stonewalled at the rim by Moses Moody and Green, but simply reached over them to grab the offensive rebound and convert a putback. \nWembanyama also blocked a 3-point attempt from Green by jumping from inside the paint, and finished with 31 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists for his fourth career triple-double. Together with Castle, who put up 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, they became the first Spurs duo to record triple-doubles in the same game. \nAnd yet, none of that was enough to win. Curry got the last laugh in the end, as he iced the game at the free throw line to finish with a season-high 46 points on 13 of 25 from the field, including 15 of 16 at the line. It was his 12th 40-point game since turning 35, tying him with Michael Jordan. (LeBron James holds the all-time lead with 15 such games.) But of course Curry is never just about scoring. He added five rebounds and five assists Wednesday night to record his 12th career game with at least 45 points, five rebounds and five assists. Only 11 players in NBA history have more such games. Twenty-two of Curry's 46 points came during the third quarter when he led a major Warriors comeback. Curry was unstoppable in the frame. He got to the line at will and made tough shot after tough shot, including two mid-range jumpers -- one from each wing -- that he banked in on purpose. The Spurs had controlled the first half and were up by as many as 16 at one point, but thanks to Curry's barrage, the Warriors won the third quarter 43-28 to take the lead for good. \nWembanyama's flashes of absurd brilliance are the league's hottest new commodity -- and rightfully so -- but there's still nothing like a Curry hot streak. No one knows that better than Wembanyama himself, who has seen what Curry can do firsthand on two continents.\nCurry, now 37, remains one of the faces of the NBA, alongside his two main peers, James (40) and Kevin Durant (37). Their longevity, though impressive, has created a sense of existential angst about who will eventually take their place and carry the league into the future. \"Not much at all,\" Curry said, when asked by The Athletic earlier this season how often he thinks about who the next face of the league will be. \"That stuff takes care of itself.\"\"You got to be more than just a great player,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr added. \"You have to have charisma, you have to have grace, you have to have a connection that the fans feel. And a connection that sort of transcends fandom. Like everybody's a LeBron fan, and everybody's a Steph fan -- everybody was a Michael fan.\"\nWembanyama has the talent and the intangibles to step into the void, and we saw plenty of evidence Wednesday that the league will be in good hands whenever Curry and his peers retire. We also got another reminder that this proud older generation isn't going away without a fight. Wembanyama may be in line for the mantle, but it won't be given to him. He's going to have to take it. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles and coach Nick Sirianni won their third straight game by defeating the Green Bay Packers, 10-7. As the final score indicates, this was not some offensive shootout. The defense held Jordan Love's unit to 261 yards of total offense, while DeVonta Smith led the way offensively with four catches for 69 yards and Philly's lone touchdown.Once again, star wideout A.J. Brown was not very involved in the game plan. He caught two of three targets for 13 yards. This marked the fourth game of the season in which he recorded below 30 receiving yards. In all, Brown caught 31 passes for 408 yards and three touchdowns in eight games played. Entering Week 11, Brown is tied for 61st in receptions, and ranks 50th in receiving yards.Brown voiced his displeasure with his role in the offense on social media earlier this season, and he's doing something similar now. Recently, Brown joined streamer jankyrondo to play some \"Madden 26.\" Brown made several comments during the live stream indicating that he was upset. When jankyrondo asked him how he was, Brown had this to say:  \n\"No. Where have you been?\" Brown replied with a laugh. \"Family's good. Everything else? No. It's a shit show. You on some 'How you been?' I've been struggling brother.\"\nThis was not all that Brown said. He continued to voice his displeasure, saying \"If you got me on fantasy (football) man, get rid of me.\"\nBrown of course peppered his Madden avatar with targets, saying, \"Good things happen when you get touches.\" \nAfter the Madden matchup, in which Brown caught nine passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns, he said, \"I'm telling you bro, that's the only highlights of damn football I'm living right now.\"\nIt felt like Brown could have been doing a bit or joking around, but what purpose would that serve? He put himself in the headlines once again with comments that surely don't endear him to his franchise or the fan base, and put pressure on coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. Even if most would agree he should be more involved in the offense. Nick Sirianni respondsDuring a Wednesday morning interview with 94WIP in Philadelphia, reporters asked Sirianni about Brown's comments. \n\"Yeah, I mean, you can, again, when there's obviously (the) ability to debate what he meant or what he said, or 'Hey, why did you say why there?' Sirianni said. \"Listen, you go with your interactions with guys on a daily basis, and not what people are ... speculating, or anything like that. We're going to continue to try to get better on offense, and we played a great game on defense. We are in tune to what's going on here and the relationships that we have in here, and the process that we have in here, and A.J.'s all-in.\"\nSirianni also had his media availability later that afternoon, and as you can imagine, he was asked several questions about Brown's comments. For example, Philly's lead man was asked if Brown's comments this season have become a distraction.\"No, I don't think so,\" Sirianni said. \"You can only go from your interactions with everybody and the way they go about their work on a daily basis that you guys aren't able to see. But no, it's business as usual.\"\nLater in the press conference, a reporter told Sirianni that it didn't seem like it was \"business as usual\" with Brown, so how does he reconcile that with his star wideout? \"Yeah guys, I'm close to being done answering these questions with this,\" Sirianni said. \"He's working hard and he is a big part of this game plan and he'll be a big part of the game plan going forward. He's working like crazy when he's here, and I'm excited to have him.\"A.J. Brown explains his comments, says he won't apologizeBrown spoke to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, and he didn't back down from his remarks. \n\"I think that's fair, I think if you got eyes you can see that,\" Brown said. \"The same things I've been saying like all season. So me, making light of my situation on Twitch with my friend, that's something I'm not apologizing for. You know? Because like I said, if you got eyes, you could see that. Shoot, that's me trying to like laugh through my situation.\"Brown said that he sees the offense struggling, and wants to help contribute. He said that because of the player that he is -- and wants to be for this team -- that he's going to have a problem with the offense not being as efficient as it should be. Brown said the issue is not about targets, but about helping the offense. The three-time Pro Bowl pass catcher said that he thinks they need to do a better job at creating for him, and putting him in position to contribute. \n\"I think if we're really focused on winning and doing our job, we can't just keep slapping a band-aid over the defense doing their job and getting us out of trouble,\" Brown said. \"At what point are we going to pick up our slack as an offense? We're so great, and that's what I'm getting at. It's not about I don't care about winning or all I care about is stats. No. It's been week after week sometimes, we're not doing our job on offense. So you can't just keep slapping a band-aid over that and you expect to win late in the year ... it's not going to happen. \"Last year, what it was, thank you for the ring, but it's a new season. They adapted, we have to adapt and we have to continue to get better and try to find new ways. That's where the frustration comes in. It's not about winning, you guys. I want to win, yes. I want to help contribute as well, do our thing on offense as well. I think that's fair.\" Brown's full media availability can be watched here, courtesy of Devan Kaney at 94WIP. \nThere was some speculation that Brown could be moved at the trade deadline, but ultimately, he wasn't. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman told reporters that teams trying to win Super Bowls don't trade away talents like A.J. Brown.\"I think that when you're trying to be a great team, it's hard to trade great players, and A.J. Brown's a great player,\" Roseman said. \"He wears the 'C' for a reason. He's an important part of this team, of this organization. He cares about winning, he cares about his teammates, and I think that when you're a team like ours that is looking forward to an opportunity to compete for a championship, you just don't get rid of guys like that. We feel very lucky to have him on our team and excited about the second half of the season with him.\"Recently, it looked like Brown's role in the offense was getting to where it should be. He exploded for 121 yards and two touchdowns on four receptions in the Week 7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, but injured his hamstring and missed the Eagles' next game against the New York Giants. Then came the disappointing outing in Green Bay, and now, these comments.\nSirianni says that Brown is \"all-in,\" while Brown says he's struggling, and clearly not happy with his contributions to the offense. Up next for the Eagles are the Detroit Lions in Philly for \"Sunday Night Football.\" \n            ",

Being at home doesn't appear to be much of an advantage for the Vikings, who committed eight false starts during a Sunday home loss to Baltimore. That's the second-most false starts by a home team in a game since 2000, as J.J. McCarthy has struggled in his debut season. He has six interceptions and four fumbles (one lost) across his four starts while being sacked 15 times. Meanwhile, Chicago has won six of its last seven games, going 5-2 ATS over that stretch. The model has Chicago prevailing versus the spread over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 11 NFL predictions: the Steelers (-5.5, 48.5) cover at home versus the Bengals in almost 60% of simulations. Cincy owns the worst defense, by far, in the NFL, ranking dead last in points allowed and yards allowed, with bottom-three rankings in pass defense, takeaways and redzone defense. Additionally, its three spread victories this year are tied for the fewest in the league, and coming off a bye won't give the Bengals much of an edge as the team is 1-5 ATS over its last six games with a rest advantage. On the other hand, Pittsburgh is 8-4 ATS at home since the start of last year, and its No. 16 offense could look like a top-five unit versus Cincy. The model projects Pittsburgh to score a touchdown more than its season average as the Steelers cover. SportsLine's advanced model also says the Over hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 11 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 11 NFL schedule and just revealed two underdogs that outright win, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        Crowds usually reserved for the weekend were on site Wednesday at the Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, Florida, as The Annika's pro-am featured two of the biggest names in women's sports in lockstep with one another. Playing together for the second straight year, Nelly Korda and Caitlin Clark joined forces for nine holes with Clark's Indiana Fever teammates, Lexi Hull and Sophie Cunningham, serving as caddies for part of the action.\"It's crazy,\" Korda said. \"That first tee was something out of a book, almost. But it's so fun. It's cool to see how many people she brings together to another sport, and it's fun to hang out with her. She's super cool. We saw each other last week at an outing, and it's nice to be alongside greats; even her teammates are super fun. It's been a blast so far.\"\nThis time last year, both players were flying high as they came into the pro-am together. Korda was named LPGA Player of the Year thanks to her six victories up to that point in the season, adding a seventh by winning The Annika later that week. Clark was coming off her WNBA Rookie of the Year campaign for the Fever. While her sophomore season featured injuries that kept her sidelined -- from both the hardwood and golf course -- at various points, the sharpshooter relayed she is back to being 100% healthy and trying to take advantage of the weather before winter arrives.\"I think it just shows how powerful supporting one another can truly be,\" Clark told Golf Channel. \"I've always been a big advocate of that and supporting women's sports. I've always been a big fan, whether it's golf or soccer, volleyball, whatever it is. So, it's really fun to see [Nelly] do her craft up close and how good she is.\n\"Getting to play with her last year, and I've played a few other rounds with her, she just makes the game of golf look really easy. You're almost like, How? She's great, and I am rooting for her to win this week.\"Despite a great run of form in 2025 that has featured eight top-10 finishes in 17 starts, Korda has remained outside the winner's circle since stepping into it at this tournament last year. She comes into The Annika having not played since the first week of October, where she finished T4 at the LOTTE Championship.No matter the time off, the world No. 2 has plenty going for her this week, given her comfort level at this golf course and another stroll around it with a familiar face on Wednesday.\n\"I think she enjoys everything that she does,\" Korda said of Clark. \"There are only so many things that you can juggle. There are so many things we have to do, and for her to be so laid back and relax and have fun and chit-chat with everyone is cool to see.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While Drake Maye, Matthew Stafford and Jonathan Taylor have dominated league MVP discussions, former Saints Super Bowl-winner and soon-to-be Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees mentioned another player who certainly deserves consideration, too. \"There's a lot of guys that are playing some outstanding football,\" Brees said during a one-on-one interview with CBS Sports. \"Drake Maye, he's made huge leaps from last year. ... Stafford is playing outstanding.\"I look at what the Seattle Seahawks are doing right now. You know, if [Jaxon Smith-Njigba] isn't an MVP candidate, he's certainly Offensive Player of the Year, right? I think those are some good names.\" Now in his third season in Seattle, Smith-Njigba is enjoying a breakout season for the Seahawks, who are off to a surprising 7-2 start under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Smith-Njigba is currently leading the NFL with 1,041 receiving yards and is on pace to break Calvin Johnson's single-season record of 1,964. \nWhile he is certainly deserving of consideration, Smith-Njigba doesn't have history on his side as far as winning league MVP. No receiver in league history has won the award, including Jerry Rice, who didn't win following the strike-shortened 1987 season despite catching 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. The award instead went to then-Broncos quarterback John Elway. Perhaps coincidentally, the year that Johnson set the single-receiving receiving record was also the last time a non-quarterback won league MVP. In the 12 years since then-Vikings running back Adrian Peterson won MVP, a quarterback has won the award each year. Speaking of quarterbacks, Brees doesn't envision Stafford -- who at 37 is enjoying arguably his finest season to date -- or the 7-2 Rams slowing down anytime soon. Brees feels that Stafford has a golden opportunity to solidify his status as a future Hall of Famer. \n\"I think he still has some great years ahead of him,\" Brees said of Stafford, who earlier this season became the ninth quarterback to reach 400 touchdown passes and the 10th one to eclipse 60,000 passing yards. \"It's really just a matter of how long he wants to play. He's in a place now with some really incredible talent around him, a great head coach in Sean McVay and a great system that just fits his strengths. \"He still has all the ability in the world,\" Brees said. \"I find that window between age 35 and 40-42-years-old is really an opportunity for a quarterback. That's almost like entering your prime. Think about just how much you understand and know mentally, and if you're still able to do it physically, then those could be some of your absolute best years.\"\nBrees is keeping himself busy this fall. In addition to keeping a close eye on the NFL in his role as an analyst, Brees has teamed up with Abbott for their \"We Give Blood Drive\" competition through their partnership with the Big Ten to see which Big Ten school can donate the most blood throughout the college football season. The winning school, which will be announced during the 2025 Discover Big Ten Football Championship Game on Dec. 6, will receive $1 million from Abbott for student or community health. There is also the opportunity to earn a Big Ten school shirt of your choice by giving blood. \n\"I think a lot of us maybe just don't recognize the impact that giving blood can do for our community and just saving lives,\" Brees said. \"One blood donation can save up to three lives. ... We're actually in a blood shortage right now as a country. It's kind of unprecedented, maybe the worst one of our of our lifetime, and so we're encouraging everybody to get out and give blood.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Arsenal's blips to start the season were not exactly irrelevant as they arrived in Germany to face Bayern Munich on Matchday 3 of the UEFA Women's Champions League, but they had earned an opportunity to officially correct course and kick off their title defense in earnest. The Gunners were on a four game unbeaten run and their only loss in Europe this season so far had come at the hands of OL Lyonnes, which is nothing to be ashamed of. By the time Ballon d'Or runner-up Mariona Caldentey put them up 2-0 in the 23rd minute at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday, it felt like Arsenal were ready to live up to their stature as one of Europe's longtime heavyweights.And yet, the Gunners unraveled completely and left Munich with a 3-2 loss to the hosts, notching their second loss in three Women's Champions League games to start the season.Things were trending in the right direction for the Gunners for the first hour, racking up 13 shots and limiting Bayern to just 0.11 expected goals during that stretch. Caldentey was the star of the show in midfield and Stina Blackstenius was busy in front of goal with three shots and the assist on Caldentey's strike during her 59 minute shift. Arsenal were well on course for an important victory, one that would reinvigorate not only their Champions League campaign but their season as a whole. The Gunners quickly collapsed, though, resting on their laurels against a Bayern side that were willing to test them – and rebooted their own European hopes in the process.\nIt was Klara Buhl's turn to dictate things in midfield, her ability to pick out her teammates with a skilled pass so obviously on display by completing 15 of her 16 passes and notching a hattrick of assists in the final half hour. The Gunners' disorganization meant Bayern's first-half strategies finally began to pay off, especially with the help of substitutes like Pernille Harder and Alara Sehitler. Bayern's habit of launching counterattacks meant Buhl connected with Sehitler for their opening goal in the 67th minute, Harder kicking things off with a smart pass to Buhl. Less than 15 minutes later, Buhl returned the favor after beating Emily Fox one-on-one, setting up Harder for a stellar finish.\nTheir game-winner in the 86th minute was the result of persistence, too – Bayern earned a set piece but kept the ball alive after the initial chance fizzed out, with center back Glodís Perla Viggosdottir finishing things off.The 32-year-old Harder showed glimpses of her former self during her substitute appearance, offering a reminder of her elite skillset. Harder's peak years may be behind her but she demonstrated the value she brings to a team like Bayern – the German side are not amongst the heavyweights of the women's game but her addition allows Bayern to punch above their weight, especially when coupled with the likes of Germany internationals Buhl and Giulia Gwinn.\nOn a day where Arsenal were poised for a statement win, Bayern came out with one instead. They were far from impressive in a 7-1 defeat to Barcelona on Matchday 1, making it easy to draw the conclusion that the usual suspects would rise to the top once again in the Women's Champions League. Three matchdays in, though, it is clear that some teams are willing and able to play spoiler. Lyon, Barcelona and Chelsea may have a grip on three automatic berths to the quarterfinals but there will be a battle for the final one – Bayern, Real Madrid, Wolfsburg and Manchester United make up a lengthy list of contenders for a spot that was technically Arsenal's to lose.\nThe Gunners, meanwhile, have no choice but to go back to the drawing board yet again. They have failed to beat any top-tier opponent this season, their defense clearly missing injured captain Leah Williamson on each of those occasions. Wednesday's defeat, though, may come with a real shock to the system – missing Williamson is explicable but for 60 minutes, they coped just fine without her. The question is not if Arsenal are capable of surviving in her absence, but why they cannot find a way to do so consistently. They are now almost guaranteed of defending their title the hard way, at risk of dropping out of the conversation entirely as a handful of other teams rise up the table.\n            ",

The Patriots are coming off an impressive 28-23 upset victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while the Jets defeated the Cleveland Browns, 27-20. The 8-2 Patriots are arguably the hottest team in the NFL, having won seven straight games. One more victory would mark New England's first eight-game winning streak since the Tom Brady era. Like the dynasty of old, the Patriots are powered by a talented defense and a star quarterback. Maye is tied with Matthew Stafford in having the best MVP odds entering Week 11.As for the 2-7 Jets, not much has gone right in Glenn's first season at the helm, but the Jets have won back-to-back games following an 0-7 start. Also New York has won two of the last three meetings with New England, so you never know what could happen in this league and with this rivalry.\nWhere to watch Jets vs. Patriots liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 13 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium -- Foxborough, MassachusettsStream: PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -12.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel)Jets vs. Patriots: Need to knowRookies are making an impact. The main headline from New England's win in Tampa was the impact made by first-year players. The Patriots became the first team to have rookies score three 50-yard touchdowns from scrimmage since 1998. TreVeyon Henderson had 55-yard and 69-yard touchdowns, while Kyle Williams caught a 72-yard touchdown pass. Henderson has finally arrived, as he recorded 150 yards from scrimmage.More of that special special teams play. The Jets couldn't have defeated the Browns last week without special teams. They became the first NFL team since 2017 to have a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown in the same game, and the first team since 2011 to have back-to-back possessions with a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown. Kene Nwangwu ran back a kick 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, then Isaiah Williams ran back a 74-yard punt return touchdown following a Browns three-and-out. Speaking of special teams, we have to give a shoutout to kicker Nick Folk as well. He's one of two kickers to have not missed a field goal this season, going a perfect 19 of 19. He hasn't missed an extra point yet either. The Jets will need good play from special teams if they want to upset the Patriots. Mike Vrabel's historic start. The former NFL Coach of the Year is tied in having the best 10-game start for a coach who inherited a 13-loss team in NFL history. Andy Reid started 9-2 in his first season with the Kansas City Chiefs, and finished 11-5. Four for IV. The Jets aren't known for their defense, but Will McDonald IV racked up four sacks vs. the Browns last week. He became the first Jet to record four sacks in a game since John Abraham in 2001! No other Jets player has more than 2.5 sacks this season. Jets vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThere's too much going against the Jets in this matchup. The defense has recorded just one takeaway all season, Justin Fields has thrown fewer than 60 yards in three out of his last four starts and Garrett Wilson is expected to miss a few weeks with his knee injury. I don't believe the Patriots will win this game by 40 points, but I'll take them at -12.5. Pick: Patriots -12.5; Under 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The NCAA placed Michigan State's football program on three years of probation following violations committed by former staff members during Mel Tucker's tenure, officials announced. The program also must vacate 14 wins from the past three seasons, including all five victories from the 2024 season, Jonathan Smith's first year as coach, according to ESPN.The NCAA found that Tucker and his former staff failed to properly oversee the program, resulting in violations involving three ineligible players. Investigators determined that staff arranged impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, covered unofficial visit expenses and engaged in improper contact with recruits.In addition to vacating wins, Michigan State must pay $30,000 plus 1.5% of the football program's budget, which was $58.6 million for the 2024 season, per ESPN. The sanctions also include restrictions on official and unofficial visits, recruiting communications, recruiting-person days and off-campus recruiting contacts and evaluations over the three-year probation period.Tucker, former general manager Saeed Khalif and former assistant coach Brandon Jordan received show-cause orders, which bar them from coaching in college until the penalties expire. Tucker was given a three-year order for failing to adequately monitor the program, while Khalif and Jordan received six- and five-year orders, respectively, for knowingly providing impermissible recruiting inducements.\nIn a joint statement, Michigan State president Kevin Guskiewicz and athletic director J. Batt said the university pursued a negotiated resolution to minimize penalties on current athletes and staff, who were not involved in the violations.\"Today's announcement brings closure to an NCAA investigation resulting from violations committed by a previous staff,\" the statement read. \"With this matter behind us, we are able to move forward, focusing on the present and future of Spartan football.\"\nMichigan State fired Tucker for cause in 2023 amid unrelated sexual harassment allegations. Meanwhile, Smith is in his second season as Michigan State's coach, with an 8-13 record prior to the vacated wins -- five of which came during the 2024 season. Three of those victories were Big Ten games. The Spartans (3-6), lost all six of their conference games this season, leaving Smith technically winless against Big Ten opponents at Michigan State.\n            ",

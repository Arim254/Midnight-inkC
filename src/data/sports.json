    "body": "\n        The first PGA Signature Event of the season arrives this week as the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am unfolds at the iconic Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif. Rory McIlroy won this event in 2025, and he's set to make his season debut this week after skipping the first four tournaments. McIlroy is +1400 in the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds from FanDuel Sportsbook, trailing only favorite Scottie Scheffler (+300) in a loaded 2026 Pebble Beach field. Other Pebble Beach contenders include Tommy Fleetwood, Si Woo Kim and Xander Schauffele all at +2500. The players who went to a playoff at the WM Phoenix Open -- Hideki Matsuyama and Chris Gotterup -- are among the golfers at +3000, with Justin Rose and Viktor Hovland at +2700. Before locking in any 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Gotterup, who has won two of the three events he's played in this year, including the WM Phoenix Open last week, doesn't even finish in the top 10 this week. He's a golfer to avoid in Pebble Beach bets. Gotteup has never played in this event before, so the model is not ready to treat him like a top-10 contender despite the fact that he's getting +3000 odds -- the same as Maysuyama and Xander Schuaffele. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Kim (+2700). Kim has been one of the hottest golfers on Tour so far this year, finishing no worse than T11 in his four events. He's been T6 or better in his last three events, and is coming off a T3 at the WM Phoenix Open and a T2 the prior week at the Farmers Insurance Open. He's also finished in the top 15 in this event in two straight seasons. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am picksThe model is also targeting four longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders, including one huge +5000 sleeper. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

It's worth noting that all five of those had a higher O/U than 210.5, as the five averaged 233.4 combined points. Three of the last four Clippers road games have gone over, and with the team trading away All-Defensive member, Ivica Zubac, Los Angeles is nowhere near as stout defensively.Two players are projected to top 20 points in scoring, while another eight players score more than 9 points. Given that, and the spread trends with these squads, SportsLine's model has the total being eclipsed by double-digits.

These two have engaged in low-scoring defensive battles in recent years, as five of their last six meetings not only failed to reach 158.5 points, but none of them even reached 153 points. Those six contests have averaged 147.3 points, with none of their last three meetings in Miami even reaching that low total.Just six teams in all of Division I allow a lower 2-point percentage than UNC, as it makes it a task to generate points from inside the arc. Meanwhile, Miami has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. With both squads projected to score at least 4 points under their season averages, the Under hits in more than 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits almost 60% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Miami vs. UNC, and which side of the spread hits almost 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the UNC vs. Miami spread to back, all from the advanced model that has simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tees off on Thursday as the first signature event of the 2026 PGA Tour season, which will also mark the season debut of superstar Rory McIlroy. The 36-year-old is coming off a three-win 2025 season, tied for his most wins in a year since 2012, and the SportsLine model projects him to get off to a strong start from Pebble Beach Golf Links in Northern California. McIlroy has the second-shortest odds to win the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am at +1300, according to the latest 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds, but the model isn't picking him to win. The model has McIlroy to finish in the top five at +290 odds as one of its top 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am prop bets. The signature event brings an elite field, including Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Tommy Fleetwood, so there will be plenty of competition at the top for McIlroy, which helps create value for the model at nearly 3-1 odds for McIlroy 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am bets. Besides backing McIlroy, the model also finds value in Hideki Matsuyama to finish in the top 10 at +300 odds and Matt Fitzpatrick as a group winner at +305 odds for AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am betting. Matsuyama nearly won last weekend's WM Phoenix Open, falling in a playoff, and the model projects him to carry that success for a top-10 finish this weekend. Before locking in any 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am prop picks or other PGA Tour bets on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am prop picksRory McIlroy to finish top 5 (+290)Hideki Matsuyama to finish top 10 (+300)Matt Fitzpatrick Group D winner (+305)Rory McIlroy: Top 5 finish (+290)The World's No. 2-ranked golfer ranked third on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained last year, including fourth in strokes gained: Off-The-Tee and ninth in strokes gained: Putting. He's always been known for his booming drives, and he didn't disappoint there last year, ranking second in driving average. His putter was key, ranking ninth in putting average and 10th in one-putt percentage, which aided his all-around game to finish fifth on the PGA Tour in scoring average. McIlroy won last year's AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in his season debut to begin a run of three wins and four top-five finishes over his first six tournaments. The model expects another strong start from McIlroy at Pebble Beach, projecting value in him at +290 odds to finish in the top 5 this weekend.Click here to bet on McIlroy at FanDuel, where new users receieve $100 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Hideki Matsuyama: Top 10 finish (+300)Matsuyama seemed to be in control the majority of last weekend's Waste Management Phoenix Open before Chris Gotterup's Sunday round of 64 forced a playoff, which Gotterup ultimately won, but Matsuyama had four strong rounds over the weekend. The 33-year-old shot a 68 or better all four days, including a 64 of his own on Friday, and he's finished no worse than 13th in his three tournaments this year. So far this season, he's 10th on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained, second in scrambling and 12th in scoring average for a solid start. He won the Hero World Challenge in December, and finished inside the top 20 in five of his final seven PGA Tour events last season to be in the top-10 mix. Given his start to this season, especially his play last weekend, the model sees value in him at these odds to crack the Top 10. Click here to bet on Matsuyama at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users receive a first bet match up to $250 bonus bet win or lose with the promo code CBSSPORTS250BM.Matt Fitzpatrick Group D winner at DraftKings (+305)At DraftKings Sportsbook, Group D features Fitzpatrick, Chris Gotterup, Robert MacIntyre, Jake Knapp and J.J. Spaun. Chris Gotterup (+285) has the best odds for the top score in that group, but the model projects Fitzpatrick to finish atop those competitors. The 29-year-old finished ninth at last week's Waste Management Phoenix Open, shooting a 70 or better in all four rounds, including an opening round of 65. Fitzpatrick has made the cut in four of six AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am tournaments, including finishing T6 in 2022. Gotterup may have an influx of action after his victory last week, but that win could lead to a letdown in a short turnaround. The model doesn't project Gotterup to finish in the top 10 this weekend, and at better than 3-1 odds, the model likes Fitzpatrick at a course he has plenty of experience at. DraftKings Sportsbook offers this prop bet, and you can click here to bet on Fitzpatrick at DraftKings, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Want more picks for the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am?You've seen the SportsLine model's 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am props for this weekend.

Petruzelli stepped in to that main event slot after Ken Shamrock suffered a cut the day of the fight.One year later, CBS announced a deal with Strikeforce with the promotion airing its first event on network TV in November 2009. Former PRIDE champion Fedor Emelianenko faced Brett Rogers in an event that peaked with nearly 5.5 million viewers. The following April saw the infamous \"Nashville Brawl\" in which Jake Shields' team brawled with Jason Miller and others after the main event, effectively ending the promotion's time on network TV.Now, CBS brings MMA back to the network. This time, it's the biggest promotion in the game airing a marquee UFC 326 event headlined by some of the sport's biggest stars.\nCBS will whet fans' appetites for UFC 326 with the debut of \"This is UFC,\" airing on Friday, Feb. 20 starting at 8 p.m. The hour-long special traces UFC's rise from underground spectacle to global powerhouse through conversations with UFC president and CEO Dana White, iconic fighters and rising stars.[11:13 AM]\n            ",

It's not Manchester United or Manchester City. It's not Liverpool or Chelsea. It's not even top of the table Arsenal, It's Sunderland. When playing at the Stadium of Light, Sunderland have been in tremendous form. They've played 12 home matches this season and have won seven of those, drawing the other five. They've taken points off  teams like Manchester City, Newcastle, Arsenal and Aston Villa while playing at home. This is important to remember that this team tends to defy odds when backed by its fans. Liverpool's Recent Form Favors GoalsLiverpool will enter this match coming off a brutal loss to Manchester City over the weekend. They went up 1-0 against the Citizens at home, and conceded two goals after the 80th minute to lose all three points. While this match was disappointing, we saw a continuation of a few things.The first is that Liverpool games have been fantastic for people who like betting on goals. Their last five matches have seen 22 goals, with players like Hugo Ekitike, Florian Wirtz and Dominik Szoboszlai really finding their strides. The defense is the main problem. Liverpool's defense has been horrendous and not up to their standard. Expect them to press for goals, but expect a Sunderland team that is dominant at home to do the same.\n            ",

Each of the six former players -- Favor Ayodele, Raeven Boswell, Makayla Elmore, Brooklynn Miles, Isabella Perkins and Jasmine Timmerson -- is represented by Keenan Holmes. Each suit alleges the university committed Title XI violations and Verdi inflicted \"emotional, psychological, and physical abuse\" against the players and created a \"hostile, discriminatory, and retaliatory environment.\"\"Verdi used his position of authority to engage in emotionally abusive conduct, retaliation, and psychological manipulation that transcended poor coaching and entered into constitutional violations,\" one lawsuit states. \"The program was defined by fear and emotional volatility as players were routinely demeaned, psychologically isolated, and pressured to perform under abusive conditions.\"In a statement to USA Today Sports, the university said the school is aware of the lawsuits and allegations and said they are \"without merit and will be vigorously defended.\"\nAmong several incidents mentioned in the lawsuits, according to USA Today Sports, are ...After one practice during the 2023-24 season -- Verdi's first with the Panthers -- Verdi allegedly told the team \"Every night I lay in bed I want to kill myself because of you.\"Ahead of a game against Clemson, Verdi allegedly \"directed xenophobic and culturally insensitive remarks\" toward a foreign-born player and told her \"ICE is coming.\"Perkins alleged she was \"routinely denied adequate medical care\" and forced to play while injured. When the issue was brought to Verdi, he allegedly retaliated. Ayodele also alleged poor treatment from Verdi when she was injured, saying he ignored \"her medical and emotional needs and [isolated] her from team support.\"Verdi allegedly mocked a player's appearance and weight and told her she looked pregnant.Verdi allegedly \"intentionally created and exploited racial division\" and disciplined players of color more harshly.The former players seek financial damages and acknowledgement that Pittsburgh failed to meet Title IX violations.Verdi came to Pittsburgh after a seven-year stretch at Massachusetts, where he inherited a struggling program and turned it into a conference champion. He is yet to replicate that success in Pittsburgh. The Panthers went 8-24 in his first season and 13-19 in his second season. They are 8-17 this season (1-11 in ACC play) and have lost eight straight games.\nPitt hosts Syracuse on Thursday.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nAs Liam Rosenior settles into his new role as the Chelsea coach, putting his own stamp on the team he inherited will be a long-term project rather than a short-term one. His challenges are similar to those many midseason hires have faced before him, though there is one unique element he is still battling -- the lingering impact of the Blues' Club World Cup-winning run last summer.While the weight of expectations loom large after winning the FIFA prize and the UEFA Conference League last season with then-coach Enzo Maresca, a more immediate issue is the physical load the Club World Cup took on Chelsea's squad. The Blues' schedule has been jam-packed since the start of the 2024-25 campaign with few breaks in between – they won the Conference League in Poland on May 28 and then opened their Club World Cup campaign in Atlanta on June 16, played seven games as they won the title on July 13 in the New York City suburbs and were back in London on August 17 to start a new season. Though their successful trip to the U.S. took place six months before Rosenior took charge at Chelsea, he admitted that the tournament's impact is still being felt.\"You have to try to freshen up the team mentally and physically,\" he said on Monday ahead of their match against Leeds United, detailing further that he has to be mindful about rotating through his squad as a result. It is something Rosenior has mentioned on a handful of occasions in the early weeks of his Chelsea tenure, most notably in the Blues' 1-0 defeat at Arsenal in the second leg of the EFL Cup semifinals last week. Cole Palmer was named amongst the substitutes that day in an attempt to manage the player's minutes during an injury-plagued season, especially as the team's priority switches to finishing in a UEFA Champions League berth.How to watch Chelsea vs. Leeds United, oddsDate: Tuesday, Feb. 10 | Time: 2:30 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- London, EnglandLive stream: PeacockOdds: Chelsea -185; Draw +330; Leeds United +500Chelsea are trending in the right direction as it pertains to a return to the Champions League next season, in large part because England are expected to pick up a bonus spot thanks to their UEFA coefficient ranking. The Blues sit fairly comfortably in fifth place with a four point cushion over sixth place Liverpool, while Rosenior has the benefit of a squad that is near full fitness for their clash against Leeds, who will be eager to pick up a favorable result in the hopes of widening their six point gap from the relegation zone. Reece James, who missed Saturday's win against Wolverhampton Wanderers with a small fitness issue, might miss Tuesday's match through illness while Chelsea's other mainstays are available.Rosenior's Chelsea have improved their goalscoring form since the coaching change, averaging 2.4 goals from 2.1 expected goals per game across all competitions, up from their tally of 1.9 goals from 1.8 expected goals per game under Maresca. He admits they are still a work in progress, though, and that they even had room for improvement as they cruised to a 3-0 advantage at Wolves before the halftime break.\"When you're the level of player I get to work with here, the reason they are top and elite is because they make great decisions in the moment,\" Rosenior said. \"Being fluid has positives in terms of being unpredictable. But if you do not have the right structure behind that you can become really open in transition. It's trying to find a balance. I felt against Wolves there were some really pleasing aspects in our rotations. In the second half we didn't stay true to our structure. That's one of the reasons why our performance wasn't as good in the second half.\"It is not the only mark Rosenior wants to leave on the team.\"My aim is we play a really high level in every minute of every game,\" he said. \"We've had a few conversations about that in recent days.\"A high-intensity approach is almost in conflict with Chelsea's fixture congestion realities, finding the sweet spot admittedly serving as Rosenior's most notable challenge as he looks to make the Blues his own. He believes, though, that players are getting used to the demands of a very intense workload.\"If I'm being honest, these lads are fantastic professionals - they live for their job which is so important,\" Rosenior said. \"You want the best product possible. We have to find a way where we can find the right balance between the two.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nCoaching changes are not actually supposed to be magical fixes, no matter how much a trigger-happy front office wants to believe it to be the case. Four weeks into Michael Carrick's tenure at Manchester United, though, things are so far, so good -- they have steadily climbed from seventh place to fourth, making real strides in the race for a finish inside the UEFA Champions League spots.Carrick has won each of his first four games in charge and is favored to add a fifth to the column on Tuesday at West Ham United, who currently sit inside the relegation zone and are three points from safety. The sample size is small but the tonal shift is starting to become clear -- Ruben Amorim's possession-oriented style has given way for Carrick's approach to let the opposition have the ball, while the tactical rigidity Amorim was well-known for no longer seems to be the case for the Red Devils. Captain Bruno Fernandes admitted as much after Saturday's 2-0 win over a 10-man Tottenham Hotspur, saying Carrick has given players more responsibility and freedom.\"I think Michael came in with the right ideas of giving the players the responsibility, but also some freedom to take the responsibility on the pitch during the decisions that are needed,\" Fernandes told TNT Sport. \"He's very good with the words and I think he still remembers when I told him last time he was our manager, for our last game [during his four-game spell as a caretaker in 2021], and I was sure Michael could be a great manager and now he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more so everyone can see, not just us as the players, that we are good players and that is why we are at Manchester United, but also the staff is very good.\"How to watch West Ham United vs. Manchester United, oddsDate: Tuesday, Feb. 10 | Time: 3:15 p.m. ETLocation: London Stadium -- London, EnglandLive stream: PeacockOdds: West Ham United +330; Draw +310; Manchester United -135Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

He inherited one of the Premier League's most effective attacks, which averaged 1.7 goals from 1.9 expected goals per game across all competitions this season under Amorim. Since Carrick took charge, their output is up considerably – they average 2.5 goals per game, even if they come up with fewer shots these days – but that figure is a departure from the 1.6 expected goals they generate per match. The nature of their four wins have varied greatly, too – they outplayed an out-of-form Manchester City, got the better of a frantic Arsenal that actually did enough to win but cracked under the pressure, played an even game against Fulham and were unimpressive for a half hour against Spurs until Cristian Romero's red card changed the game.They deserve credit for not only surviving each one of these matches but coming out on top, this stretch of wins putting them on course to return to the Champions League next season in the process. If that is all Carrick is to be judged on, he is on his way to a job well done; the Champions League, after all, will only bolster United's attempts to return to their past glory. How exactly Carrick will leave his tactical imprint on the Red Devils is unclear, but, so far, the vibe shift seems to be enough to notch the team's first four-game winning streak in two years.\"You've got to enjoy the buzz of winning, that's what we're in it for,\" Carrick said on Monday ahead of the trip to West Ham. \"You can't just be flat-lined all the time. You have to feel the waves of emotion. It would all be a little bit boring and pointless if you didn't, because winning games is what we all strive for. The big challenge is knowing the hard work and preparation that has got you there. Winning a game of football at this level is tough, so you never assume the next one's just going to be alright.\"Even in the spirit of keeping things light, though, do not expect a certain long-haired fan to be name-dropped in Carrick's preparations for a potential fifth win in a row.\n\"I can say I'm aware of it, yeah,\" Carrick said on Monday when he was asked about Untied fan Frank Ilett, who has gone viral for waiting to cut his hair until the Red Devils won five games in a row. \"My kids have made me aware of it, if anything, but it certainly won't go into the team talk from a professional level. I can understand what's going on with it and it does make me smile but it won't have an impact ultimately in the end.\"\n            ",

It's obviously weird and unfortunate that he apparently pulled himself from the competition pregame. To be clear, I've also had flu-like symptoms; I know it can be  rough. But even Self said it wasn't clear Peterson wouldn't play until about an hour before tipoff, and the optics on that aren't great even if his absence was legitimate.Either way ...\nKansas is up to No. 9 in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Arizona dropped to No. 2.

    "body": "\n        Steve Spurrier has been retired from coaching for a decade, but the former Florida and South Carolina coach hasn't lost his knack for speaking his mind. And when it comes to Clemson coach Dabo Swinney's recent allegations of transfer portal tampering, Spurrier didn't hold back.\"I thought by now somebody would've told Dabo, 'Dabo, there ain't no rules anymore,'\" Spurrier said Monday during a Zoom call with reporters ahead of his induction into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame.Swinney's frustration this offseason stems from the case of Luke Ferrelli, a linebacker transfer from California. Swinney alleged in a Jan. 23 press conference that Ole Miss and new coach Pete Golding continued to contact Ferrelli after he had already signed with Clemson and enrolled in spring semester classes. Ferrelli ultimately flipped to Ole Miss, prompting Swinney to call the situation blatant tampering and hand evidence over to the ACC, which passed it along to the NCAA and SEC.Under NCAA rules, contacting a player in Ferrelli's situation would typically be prohibited, with potential penalties ranging from fines to recruiting restrictions. But Spurrier, 80, expressed skepticism that those rules are being enforced in today's college football landscape.\"They're still on the books, I guess, where you can't do it after this date or that date,\" Spurrier said. \"... But I don't know if they're ever going to enforce any rules now or not.\"\nInstead of dwelling on potential violations, Spurrier framed the situation as a reality check for Swinney and any coach reluctant to embrace the modern era of college athletics, where NIL, rev-share money and the transfer portal have reshaped roster construction.\"Gosh, basketball they've got pros coming back to play in college there,\" Spurrier said, referencing Alabama's Charles Bediako, who returned to play after signing an NBA contract and spending time in the G League -- only to have a judge recently deny his motion to remain eligible for the rest of the season. \"I think Dabo has learned now he's got to start paying his players just like everybody else is,\" Spurrier said. \"Or you'll get left behind. You can complain, but I don't know how good it's going to do.\"\nSpurrier's comments carry extra weight given his obvious history with Clemson. During his 11 seasons at South Carolina from 2005 to 2015, he went 6-4 against the Tigers, including a five-game winning streak against Swinney from 2009 to 2013. He finished his Gamecocks career with 86 wins, the most in program history, after previously winning a national championship and six SEC titles at Florida.\n            ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here.\nHappy Tuesday, sports fans. While some spend their birthdays out partying, I am spending mine making sure you're up to speed on all the sports news you need to know to get your day going.The Super Bowl (metaphorical) hangover is still wearing off, but we're already turning our attention to next season, with every fan dreaming of what may be. After all, between the Patriots' turnaround and the Seahawks' pitch-perfect decision to put their offense in the hands of Sam Darnold, it feels like nothing is impossible in the NFL. Oh, and we have completely given ourselves over to OlympicsMania. From curling to skiing, the Americans have gold medals in their grasp today, as well as a big preliminary women's hockey game between Team USA and Canada. \nLet's dive in and catch you up on everything you need to know.  📋 Five things to know Tuesday Raiders officially hire Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak. The Raiders have landed their next coach. Or at least it's official now since the hire had been planned, but they had to wait for the Super Bowl to be over. So just hours after Kubiak capped off his time as Seattle's offensive coordinator with a Super Bowl ring, he was hired as the next man to lead Las Vegas. Kubiak takes the reins after the Raiders fired Pete Carroll after one season in which the team went 3-14.Spring training opens. With pitchers and catchers reporting to camp, the MLB season is on the horizon. We have identified a reason for every fan to be excited about their team's season -- yes, even for a White Sox fan like me.College basketball rankings update as Arizona loses first game. As Arizona continued to dominate, they were seen as the clear No. 1 team in the nation, though that could change after an 82-78 loss to Kansas on Monday night. With a big win over Duke, North Carolina has jumped three spots to No. 11 in the AP Top 25. Duke remains in the top 10 of the Coaches Poll after the loss, sitting at No. 6.Stephen Curry to miss All Star Game. Curry will be out for two regular season games in addition to missing the All Star Game, where he was named as a Western Conference starter. Curry is dealing with runner's knee and Golden State is hoping he'll be back in action following the brief hiatus at the start of next week.A shakeup in the Power 18 golf rankings. After winning the 2026 American Express in January, it's no surprise that Scottie Scheffler remains at No. 1 in the Power 18 golf rankings. However, Chris Gotterup's second win of 2026, at the WM Phoenix Open on Sunday, has him moving from unranked to No. 6. 🏈 Do not miss this: Putting a bow on the NFL season and looking ahead \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Your Monday water cooler talk no doubt included plenty of Super Bowl talk. We spent much of our day going over the Seahawks' lopsided win over the Patriots, asking questions like Legion of Boom or the Dark Side, which was the better Seattle championship defense? On Sunday, that vaunted Seahawks' defense had Drake Maye twisted in knots, causing some to pump the brakes on the Patriots quarterback's superstar rise. Jonathan Jones broke down Seattle's magical night with perspectives from the field and the locker room to see how their Super Bowl win came together. Jones: \"One of Seattle's greatest strengths was going up against the Patriots' greatest weakness. One Seahawks player told me the team didn't fear New England because they didn't possess the pass catchers like the Rams, the only team this player thought matched up well against them. Without those guys on the outside, and with those guys on the inside, this player believed it would be quick work for Seattle.  \"The 14 pressures given up by Patriots left tackle Will Campbell made him decline multiple opportunities to speak with the media. Those pressures, along with his poor play all postseason, will be the narrative that follows him into next season. The Patriots knew he didn't have long arms when they drafted him fourth overall as the No. 1 offensive tackle selected, but he would make up for that with his technique.\"Read much, much more coverage of the Super Bowl, as well as some looks ahead at next season. \nHow Patriots wasted highly unusual opportunity vs. SeahawksHow Seahawks' Mike Macdonald's Super Bowl masterpiece was years in the makingNext up for Patriots after loss: Star power needed, rookie makeoverSuper Bowl LXI logo unveiled: Colors spark theories for 2027 Valentine's Day gameWhat's next for Seahawks after winning the title?

Los Angeles is down a whopping 13 spots after their transactions, and Brad Botkin explained why the moves harm the Clippers in the immediate future. Botkin: \"The Clippers have shot into a play-in spot but that didn't keep them from effectively punting on the rest of the season by trading James Harden and Ivica Zubac. Those were both very good deals for the Clippers in the long run, but for this year Darius Garland isn't healthy and you lose a bunch of production from what were two of your three best players.\"A number of contenders boosted their short-term outlooks, however, with win-now moves at the deadline. The Cavaliers, Knicks and Timberwolves are all on the rise.  Here are the NBA's top five teams after the trade deadline: Spurs (Last week: 2)Thunder (1)Nuggets (4)Pistons (3)Celtics (7) 🏅 United States goes for gold after curling drama, Lindsey Vonn injury reactions \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            On Monday, the American curling mixed doubles team of Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse reminded everyone of what makes the Olympics special. After all, when else is social media discourse dominated by the slow gliding of a smooth rock across ice, guided to a target by a broom? If the Super Bowl didn't provide the drama you were seeking, this United States squad delivered as the Team USA advanced to today's gold medal match vs. Sweden when Thiesse scored the deciding two points on the final throw of their semifinal battle with defending gold medalists, Italy. \nMeanwhile, there is still plenty of discourse about Lindsey Vonn's decision to ski on a torn ACL, a decision that led to Vonn crashing in the women's downhill final on Sunday. Vonn said she has \"no regrets\" about her decision, and several Olympic skiing figures defended Vonn. Those figures included Vonn's teammate Keely Cashman, who pointed out that Vonn's crash had nothing to do with her injured knee.

Get started now:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 42-25 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

Anybody following its MLB betting and NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Thursday's best bets at BetMGMBengals +5.5 vs. Steelers (-105)Brewers money line vs. Dodgers (+155)Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (-135)Combining these three picks into a Thursday MLB and NFL parlay at BetMGM would result in a payout of +780 (risk $100 to win $780). Bet it at BetMGM here:Bengals +5.5 vs. Steelers (-105)\"The Steelers are coming off their most impressive win of the season, but you could blame the awful spot for Cleveland, and I'm still not sure what they do better than most teams. The defense looks a lot better now that it's healthier, but it was healthy in Week 1 when it got gashed by a Jets team that is 50-50 to complete a forward pass most weeks,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The 5.1 yards per play on offense is comparable to the Panthers and Raiders. Basically, this doesn't profile as a team that should be laying this many points on the road, especially in a divisional matchup, even against a bad Bengals team.\" Back Cincinnati at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Brewers money line vs. Dodgers (+155)Payroll disparity is showing a bit with Los Angeles winning seven of its first eight postseason games. Now the Dodgers will trot out Tyler Glasnow as their Game 3 starter and Glasnow has thrown 7 2/3 scoreless innings this postseason. However, he does have a 4.55 career ERA against Milwaukee and the Brewers have only been beaten by two runs or more twice during the 2025 MLB Playoffs. Jose Quintana will likely pitch an extended stretch for Milwaukee tonight and he threw three scoreless innings of his own in his only postseason appearance thus far. Road teams have won every game of the NLCS and ALCS so far, and the model sees value here with the Brewers winning in 48% of simulations. Bet the Brewers at BetMGM here:Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (-135)The Blue Jays finally got on the board with a 13-4 win in Game 3 on Wednesday, but Seattle still holds a 2-1 advantage in the series. The Mariners should also feel pretty good sending Luis Castillo to the mound, as he has only given up one hit in six innings of work this postseason. Meanwhile, expected Toronto starter Max Scherzer posted a 10.20 ERA in September and is making his first appearance since Sept. 24 tonight. The model says Seattle wins in 59% of simulations. Bet Seattle at BetMGM:Want more NFL picks for Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

The former LSU star turned in a truly electric 2024 campaign, leading the NFL in catches (127), receiving yards (1,708), and touchdown receptions (17), earning him the rare receiving \"Triple Crown.\" That season's performance cemented his status as one of the league's elite wideouts and a focal point of the Bengals' offense. In 2025, through six games, Chase has already recorded 42 receptions for 468 yards and four touchdowns, averaging 11.1 yards per catch. While those numbers don't yet match his 2024 peak, he remains one of the most reliable and explosive targets in football. Chase displayed an obvious rapport with new Cincinnati starter Joe Flacco, catching 10 passes for 94 yards and a touchdown in their first game together. See who else to roster here.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, which may include a play $5, get $100 offer:Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Steelers running back Jaylen Warren.

Despite splitting time in the backfield, he consistently provided a spark for the Steelers' offense with his quick burst and reliable hands. In 2025, through four games, Warren has rushed 54 times for 184 yards (3.4 yards per carry) and added 13 catches for 153 yards, averaging 11.8 yards per reception. While his rushing efficiency has dipped slightly, his impact as a pass-catcher continues to stand out.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season kicked off in Italy in August as Napoli started the campaign to defend the 2024-25 title, after winning their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter, Juventus and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Lazio, Fiorentina, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.This weekend's Serie A slate features some huge battles, highlighted by Inter visiting the capital to face Roma. Here's what to know:Gasperini's strong start at RomaAS Roma decided to start a new chapter in the summer of 2025 when the Giallorossi appointed former Atalanta manager Gian Piero Gasperini as the new head coach, starting a new cycle after coaching the Nerazzurri for almost a decade. Despite the high expectations, as Gasperini replaced the legendary coach Claudio Ranieri, who is now advising the ownership, the Italian manager was able to win five of the opening six Serie A matches and only lost one home game against Torino. In his previous experiences, at Atalanta and at Inter as well, Gasperini took some time to integrate into his new clubs, but this time he was able to immediately get into the minds of the players and the whole environment. Gasperini's tactical system immediately worked out, and some players like former Brighton striker Evan Ferguson and Argentinian talent Matias Soule are now perfectly involved in the team, with a lot of potential to improve their numbers in the coming matches. The game against Inter that will take place this Saturday will be key to assessing both teams and their status, as the Giallorossi have the big chance to send a message to the competitors. After some struggles, Roma are now back on track, and they can be ambitious about the upcoming season.  \nHow to watch AS Roma vs. Inter, oddsDate: Saturday, Oct. 18 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Olimpico -- RomeLive stream: Paramount+Odds: AS Roma +213; Draw +211; Inter +134How to watch Serie A Matchday 7All times U.S./EasternSaturday, October 18Lecce vs. Sassuolo, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Pisa vs. Hellas Verona, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Torino vs. Napoli, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Inter, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, October 19Como vs. Juventus, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. Bologna, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Genoa vs. Parma, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Atalanta vs. Lazio, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AC Milan vs. Fiorentina, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, October 20Cremonese vs. Udinese, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- For the first time in over a month, Joe Burrow is in attendance to watch his team play. The Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback hasn't been to a game since injuring his toe in Week 2, but he's in the building at Paycor Stadium for the team's huge Thursday night showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Burrow has been sidelined since Sept. 14 when he suffered a Grade 3 turf toe injury during the first half of a 31-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The superstar quarterback underwent surgery just five days later and he's been rehabbing ever since. The Bengals had a home game in Week 5 that Burrow could have attended, but he decided to stay home, which might have been for the best, because Ja'Marr Chase didn't want him there. \"Hell no. He needs to get ready,\" Ja'Marr Chase said when asked if Burrow should attend the Week 5 game against the Lions. \"They don't need to see Joe's face. Just get healthy, come around later.\" \n        \n            \n                Steelers vs. Bengals prediction: Can Aaron Rodgers keep rolling as Cincinnati fights to stay alive?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bengals hit the road in Week 6 for a game against the Packers and Burrow obviously didn't go to that, but he was on the field during pregame on Thursday. \nBurrow was in a boot, but he was able to walk on his own, which is definitely an encouraging sign for the Bengals. \nSo when will Burrow return? When Burrow underwent surgery on Sept. 19, he was staring at a timeline of roughly three months and that still seems to be the case. According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, Burrow is targeting a mid-December return and he \"absolutely intends\" to comeback. \"He is on track, has had no setbacks,\" Rapoport said Thursday, \"If this continues in that direction, he should be back on the field in mid-December and has told people close to him that he absolutely intends to be back, just needs the team to stay alive until then.\"That last sentence is the key part here; Burrow is likely only going to return if the Bengals are still in the playoff race and that might explain why he decided to attend the game on Thursday. At 2-4, the Bengals' season is essentially on the line against the Steelers. If they win, they'll be 3-4 and right back in the thick of the AFC North, but if they lose, they'll drop to 2-5, and at that point, it's hard to envision a scenario where they'd still be in playoff contention come December. \nIf he returns in mid-December, that means he'd likely be back on the field in either Week 15 (vs. Ravens) or Week 16 (at Dolphins). For the Bengals to stay in playoff contention, they'd likely need to go 5-2 or 5-3 before getting to mid-December, so Joe Flacco will need to keep the team afloat if the Bengals are hoping to get their other Joe back. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Penn State quarterback Drew Allar underwent successful surgery on Wednesday to address his broken left ankle, according to ESPN's Pete Thamel. Allar sustained the injury -- the extent of which had not been divulged -- last Saturday in the Nittany Lions' 22-21 loss to Northwestern, and former coach James Franklin announced at the time that the fourth-year quarterback would miss the rest of the season.Allar is reportedly on track to make a full recovery, and he could be cleared to return to workouts in the coming months.The injury occurred in the closing minutes of Penn State's third straight loss, one that led the program to fire Franklin in the highest-profile and most surprising coaching change of the 2025 college football season. Allar tucked the ball for a scramble with just over three minutes left in the fourth quarter, and he fell awkwardly upon contact with two Northwestern defenders. He spent several minutes on the turf before trainers assisted him to the sideline and eventually carted him into the locker room.\n        \n            \n                The failure to develop QB Drew Allar sealed James Franklin's fate at Penn State\n                \n                    Brian Dohn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAllar, a three-year starter who led Penn State to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season, finished the year as a 64.8% passer with 1,100 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions. He ran into trouble in the final weeks of his season with a string of underwhelming performances in losses to Oregon, UCLA and Northwestern. The Nittany Lions, in turn, fell from national title contention to afterthoughts in the Big Ten with losses to a pair of conference bottom-dwellers.\nWhat are Drew Allar's next steps?Given that 2025 is Allar's final year of eligibility, the ankle injury almost certainly brought an unfortunate end to his college career. He could submit a medical hardship waiver application to seek a fifth year of eligibility, but given that he participated in more than 30% of Penn State's regular-season games, it is unlikely the waiver would be approved. Unless the NCAA changes its eligibility rules to add a fifth year, Allar will now turn his attention toward the NFL Draft.Though Allar considered leaving for the NFL after last season, this was supposed to be a year for Allar to both lead Penn State to a national title and further boost his pro prospects. His stock took a tumble during his career as Penn State's starter as he struggled to deliver on the lofty expectations placed on him as a former five-star recruit. Allar displayed ample promise in his debut season in the role when he led the Big Ten with 25 touchdowns and threw just two interceptions, but he failed to replicate those numbers in the years since.NFL teams will be tasked with weighing Allar's still-tantalizing physical tools with his up-and-down production. They must also determine how much of his ceiling was capped by Penn State's lackluster run of wide receivers -- or to what extent those receivers underwhelmed because of Allar.\nThe Nittany Lions, meanwhile, will turn to redshirt freshman Ethan Grunkenmeyer as they continue their season on the road against Iowa on Saturday under interim coach Terry Smith. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThree teams remain in contention for two playoff spots when Week 20 of the 2025 CFL season takes place this weekend. One of those clubs is the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, who kick off the week by hosting the West Division champion Saskatchewan Roughriders at 8 p.m. ET on Friday at Princess Auto Stadium.Winnipeg (8-8) can clinch a postseason berth with a victory against Saskatchewan (12-4) and a loss by the Edmonton Elks, who visit BC Place to take on the BC Lions at 10:30 p.m. ET on Friday. The Blue Bombers have struggled of late as their 25-20 setback at Edmonton last week was their fourth loss in six games.The Roughriders defeated the Toronto Argonauts 27-19 in Week 19 for their second straight win and are 2-0 against Winnipeg this year despite having trailed by 10 points in each meeting. With nothing at stake, Saskatchewan likely will begin preparing for the playoffs and rest some of its starters.Edmonton (7-9) has a difficult road to a playoff spot, as it needs to win its final two games of the season and either Winnipeg or the Calgary Stampeders lose both of theirs. The Elks have posted back-to-back victories but are 0-2 against BC this year and have lost 10 of their last 11 meetings with the Lions.BC (9-7), which already has punched its ticket to the postseason, is coming off its final bye of the campaign but enters this matchup with a four-game winning streak. Quarterback Nathan Rourke was superb in both of the Lions' triumphs over the Elks this year, throwing for at least 320 yards in each contest while throwing for a combined five touchdowns.Saturday also features a doubleheader that begins at 3 p.m. ET, when the Ottawa Redblacks host the Montreal Alouettes at TD Place. Ottawa (4-12) is coming off its fourth consecutive loss and sixth in seven games, a 30-10 setback at Montreal last week.The Alouettes (9-7) have clinched a playoff berth but still can capture the East Division title, as a victory against the Redblacks would move them into a tie with the idle Hamilton Tiger-Cats for first place. Montreal then would need to defeat Winnipeg in the final week of the season and have Ottawa knock off Hamilton.Since suffering a 38-24 loss against the Redblacks in Week 13 of the 2022 campaign, the Alouettes have won 10 consecutive meetings between the teams - including two this year. Montreal now will be looking to sweep the season series and extend its overall winning streak to five games.Week 20 concludes when Toronto visits McMahon Stadium to battle Calgary at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. The Stampeders (9-7), who ended their four-game losing streak with last week's 37-20 triumph at Hamilton, will secure a spot in the postseason with a victory.This is the season finale for the reigning Grey Cup champions Argonauts (5-12), whose loss at Saskatchewan last week was their fourth in a row. Toronto hopes to go out on a high note and complete a sweep of the season series after having defeated Calgary 29-19 at home in Week 2.Winnipeg is a 7.5-point favorite against Saskatchwan at FanDuel Sportsbook, while Edmonton is a 5.5-point underdog versus BC. Meanwhile, Montreal is favored by 10.5 points in its matchup with Ottawa and Calgary is -9.5 against Toronto.SportsLine football expert Emory Hunt is 39-34 on his CFL picks this year and has revealed his selections for Week 20 of the 2025 CFL season, including against-the-spread predictions and leans on the total of every game.Hunt is the founder and CEO of Football Gameplan, which has been supplying analysis of all levels of football since 2007. He is a former running back for the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns and knows the game from a player's perspective. Hunt's dedication to analysis of all levels of professional football helped him crush the CFL, XFL and USFL in 2023, posting a combined ATS record of 98-73 in his SportsLine articles.Saskatchewan Roughriders at Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Friday, 8 p.m. ET)Pick: Saskatchewan +7.5Lean: Under 48.5The Roughriders will be resting a bevy of key starters and contributors in this game since they've already secured a spot in the postseason. Predicting how reserves will perform in a matchup against starters on a team that needs to win to stay alive in the playoff hunt always is a challenge. I will take the safe approach and side with the squad that would love to keep a division rival out of the postseason. That's the Roughriders. Edmonton Elks at BC Lions (Friday, 10:30 p.m. ET)Pick: Edmonton +5.5Lean: Over 56.5We haven't seen these two square off since July, when the Elks were a totally different team. Now, this Edmonton club is vying for a playoff spot. We saw the Elks take care of business against Winnipeg last weekend and they can move closer to their goal with a great showing against the Lions, who already have clinched a postseason berth. Expect Edmonton's best effort as its playoff hopes are fading but still alive.Montreal Alouettes at Ottawa Redblacks (Saturday, 3 p.m. ET)Pick: Montreal -10.5Lean: Over 50.5Last week's performance was an ugly one by the Redblacks, and it's tough to see how they can turn things around quickly enough to avoid a similar result. In fact, expect more of the same from the Alouettes, especially considering how chippy the game was late in the fourth quarter. With Montreal likely using its reserves, the intensity of the rivalry remains.Toronto Argonauts at Calgary Stampeders (Saturday, 7 p.m. ET)Pick: Calgary -9.5Lean: Over 52.5The Stampeders are in the driver's seat in the race for a playoff spot, but they haven't really played particularly well down the stretch if we're being honest. In comes a Toronto team that hasn't had a quarterback come up with an impressive performance all season. Look for Calgary to treat this as a \"Get Right\" game as it hopes to punch its ticket to the postseason.\n            ",

Given all of the injuries Washington has seen at receiver recently, Burks, who spent his entire career with the Tennessee Titans before being waived earlier this month, could be elevated quickly.Commanders star wideout Terry McLaurin has missed the last three games with a quad injury, and did not practice on Thursday after being limited on Wednesday. Deebo Samuel is also dealing with a heel injury that has held him out of practice this week, and Noah Brown was recently placed on injured reserve. \n        \n            \n                Predicting overreactions for NFL Week 7: Trey Hendrickson done with Bengals? Commanders miss playoffs?\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSamuel played through the heel injury on Monday night during Washington's 25-24 loss to the Chicago Bears. He caught four passes for just 15 yards. Chris Moore was actually the Commanders' leading receiver in Week 6 with 46 yards and a touchdown on three receptions. Moore, Luke McCaffrey and rookie Jaylin Lane have been called upon to step up in the past few weeks.\nDespite the thin receiver corps, the Commanders, now 3-3 on the year, are 1.5-point road favorites (via FanDuel) against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. Burks reportedly visited with Washington this week. The former No. 18 overall pick cleared waivers earlier this month after Tennessee parted ways with him following three unproductive seasons. He has played just 27 career games, and caught 53 passes for 699 yards and one touchdown. Burks has struggled to stay on the field, having never played more than 11 games in a single season. He tore his ACL in practice late last season, then broke his collarbone in training camp just three months ago. \nThe 25-year-old pass-catcher certainly needed a change of scenery, and could potentially get his career on track in Washington. Burks has legitimate size at 6-foot-2, 225 pounds, and was a versatile playmaker during his days at the University of Arkansas.\n            \n    ",

Tkachuk suffered the injury in the Senators' home-opener against the Nashville Predators on Monday.In the first period of the Sens' home-opener, Tkachuk was cross-checked into the boards by Predators defenseman Roman Josi, who was assessed a minor penalty on the play. Tkachuk returned to the game in a limited capacity, but he was noticeably absent when Ottawa pushed to tie the game late.\nAfter further evaluation, it was determined that Tkachuk needed surgery to repair the thumb. He now faces an extended absence, and the Senators have to stay afloat without one of their best players.The No. 4 overall pick in the 2018 NHL Draft, Tkachuk evolved into one of the best players in the league. From 2021-24, Tkachuk eclipsed the 30-goal mark in three consecutive seasons. Last year, Tkachuk 's offensive numbers dipped, but his five-on-five impacts were quite strong as he led Ottawa back to the playoffs for the first time since 2017.\nWith Tkachuk out for up to two months, the rest of the roster will have to pick up the slack in order to remain in the thick of the playoff race. Star center Tim Stützle will obviously be key to that, but how much can the Sens get out of players like Dylan Cozens and Shane Pinto? Their depth will be tested in a competitive Atlantic Division.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the most successful franchises in NFL history, but despite all their success, there is one thing they've never been able to pull off: The Steelers have NEVER won a Thursday night road game against a divisional opponent.  The Steelers have played a total of eight divisional Thursday games on the road in franchise history, and they've gone 0-8 in those games, which includes going 0-6 under Mike Tomlin. The Steelers will have a chance to end their inexplicable losing streak when they travel to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals in a Thursday game where Pittsburgh is favored by 5.5 points, per Caesars SportsbookThe Steelers had a chance to end the streak last year but ended up losing a 24-19 shocker to the Cleveland Browns in a game where Pittsburgh was favored by 3.5 points.The streak started in 1980 with a loss to the Houston Oilers, and it's now been going on for 45 years.\nOpponent \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tScore \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tDate \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOilers (AFC Central) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOilers 6-0Dec. 4, 1980 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJaguars (AFC Central) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tJaguars 20-6Dec. 2, 1999 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 13-Dec. 10, 2009 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens 22-20Nov. 28, 2013 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tRavens 26-6Sept. 11, 2014 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 21-7Nov. 14, 2019 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 29-17Sept. 22, 2022 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns (AFC North) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBrowns 24-19Nov. 21, 2024 \t\t\t\tThat's 0-8 straight up and 1-7 against the spread. This streak has been going on for so long that the Steelers have played two divisional games against opponents who aren't even in their division anymore (Jaguars and Oilers/Titans). It's not just divisional games, though, Thursday nights have generally been a nightmare for the Steelers. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers are 3-15 in Thursday road games, which is the worst winning percentage of any NFL team in that span. Here's a look at the three teams that have been the worst in Thursday road games since 1970 (via CBS Sports Research): 1. Steelers: 3-15 (.167)2. Browns: 2-8 (.200)3. Jets: 3-11 (.214)The fact that the Browns and Jets are on that list isn't a surprise to anyone, but seeing the Steelers lumped in there is definitely shocking. Overall, the Steelers are 12-18 on Thursdays in franchise history. If you look at just the games played since Tomlin was hired, the numbers don't get any better. The Steelers coach is 2-9 on the road in Thursday games, including 0-6 against divisional opponents. Since the start of the 2019 season, the Steelers are 1-5 on Thursday night. \nIf anyone can help the Steelers snap this streak, it's Aaron Rodgers. The four-time NFL MVP has won 11 Thursday night games in his career, which is the second-most in league history. (He has a Thursday record of 11-5.) The only QB with more Thursday wins is Tom Brady, and Rodgers could tie him with a win over the Bengals. It's almost fitting that Rodgers could tie Brady because he'll be tying another Brady mark as soon as he takes the field in Cincinnati. The matchup between Rodgers and Joe Flacco will mark just the second pairing ever of two quarterbacks over the age of 40. The only other time it happened came in 2020 when Brady and Drew Brees played each other three times while playing for the Buccaneers and Saints. Brady also has the most wins of any QB ever against the Steelers with 12, which is worth noting because Flacco is right behind him. If the Bengals pull the upset, not only will Pittsburgh's nightmare losing streak continue, but Flacco will tie Brady for the most wins ever over the Steelers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Every NFL team's final injury report comes out Friday afternoon after their last full practice of the week, but there's no need to wait until Friday for the Dallas Cowboys last report in the case of All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. He's back for Week 7 against the Washington Commanders after missing the last three games with ankle sprain he suffered back in Week 3 at the Chicago Bears.\"I don't think it'll be long at all,\" Lamb said Thursday when asked how long it will take him to shake the rust off on Sunday. \"I feel like I'm out there moving around, running around, being me. Happy as can be, obviously, and [I] just believe in my ankle. Obviously, I feel like it's it's back to where I needed it to be. Pretty good [feeling].\"The 26-year-old wideout could have returned last week at the Carolina Panthers in Week 6, but that would have required Lamb playing with limitations and on a snap count. This week, he is all systems go. \n\"That's why we took an extra week off. Just to make sure that I had that comfort,\" Lamb said. \"Just to make sure that I had the same explosiveness. Just to make sure I had that same stability. I'm cool.\"  Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer turned 52-years-old on Thursday, and he essentially confirmed Lamb's return with glee before practice even kicked off, posing for a picture with No. 88 and shouting \"he's my present.\"\"Yeah if he's breathing, I'd feel pretty good,\" Schottenheimer said on Wednesday. … \"CeeDee knows how to play football. If he runs around and catches a pass or two, I'm good.\"\nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott confirmed Schottenheimer's declaration that his No. 1 target is ready to roll in Week 7. \"A lot of excitement obviously. Just the last two days at practice, he looks good,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"He's ready to go. Obviously I saw him last week during the rehab and probably could have then. Being careful, but he's ready to go. Looks great. It's going to be fun.\"\nTwo No. 1 receiversDallas' pecking order in the passing game might be a little less pronounced going forward with Lamb rejoining George Pickens as the Cowboys' 1A and 1B. With Lamb sidelined, Pickens rocketed his performance up to an All-Pro level: Pickens' six receiving touchdowns are tied with Detroit Lions All-Pro receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for the most in the NFL, and his 525 receiving yards rank third. He is also on a five-game streak with a receiving touchdown, tied for the longest active touchdown streak in the NFL with Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Jalen McMillan. \nA significant factor in Pickens' uptick is Dallas' realization that he's more than just the stereotypical, big-bodied outside receiver (6-foot-3-inches tall, 200 pounds) that the Pittsburgh Steelers portrayed Pickens to be in his first three seasons. His route-running heat map, via TruMedia, from his last two seasons in Pittsburgh (2023-2024) glow bright yellow down the sidelines, indicating most of his routes were distributed on vertical deep shots or \"go balls.\" This year with the Cowboys, Pickens' 2025 heat map still possesses some glowing yellow down the sideline, but he now also has some of that in the middle of the field.\"The one thing that George has proven over these last couple weeks is our ability to move him around which makes us more difficult to defend,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Because really CeeDee was the guy we were trying to move around right. and George was kind of one spot. But George has been terrific with us, putting him in different spots, different positions. I think he kind of likes is because it holds his attention and keeps him dialed in. I think it's a great thing. There's one ball, we know that. They're both really good players. So we'll see where the defense makes the ball go.\"Pickens affirmed his head coach's suspicions: he is relishing the expansion of his route tree all over the field in 2025 at the age of 24. \n\"[It's] Super good, moving me around especially when CeeDee was out gave me a better understanding of the playbook as well. When he [Lamb] comes back, [receiver Kavontae] Turp[in] comes back, they can move more of us all around a little bit better than we did before,\" Pickens said on Wednesday. \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Pickens, a 2022 second-round pick who is in the final year of his rookie deal this season, obviously appreciated the opportunity to pad his numbers with Lamb sidelined, but he's fully embracing share the label of WR1 again with Lamb in Week 7. \"Super excited. I don't even think the words can fully explain fully, him and possibly Turp. Super excited,\" Pickens said. \"Way more dangerous, way more explosive too when you got other guys like Cee[Dee] and Turp out there. It's another component of explosiveness that you can't really describe.\" \nSo how will Prescott figure out who gets the football now that Lamb is fully healthy, and Pickens has established himself as fully capable of being a No.1 target all on his own? He won't favor Lamb, who Prescott obviously has the great rapport with having played six seasons together now. It's simply a race to see who can get open first. Prescott's current approach is clearly working because he's thrown 10 touchdowns and no interceptions in the last three games with Lamb missing while rehabbing his sprained ankle.\"It's as much Schotty, the play caller, and the guys' [coaches] in the game plan, [their] responsibility of putting them in those positions where they are read No. 1 or read No. 2,\" Prescott said. \"From there, it's easy for me. Just stay within myself, keep reading the defense the way I've been seeing it, staying within the play, whoever gets open gets it. ... Obviously from the way that they orchestrate it, he'll [Lamb] get his chances.\"Prescott raved about the flexibility and the advantage of having two elite receivers who are both high-end caliber players, and the blessing in disguise that Lamb's injury was for Pickens' development. \n\"I think in the past of when we break the huddle, you don't know where CeeDee is lining up, and I think if CeeDee doesn't get hurt, GP is probably just going to be an outside receiver for the most part going forward. Him having those games, showing his ability, showing what he can do,\" Prescott said. ... \"You're going to have to figure out where they both are. If they both are maybe in the slot, maybe on the same side. Having the ability to have two guys like that and just put them wherever we feel is best each and every play, it's only going to be beneficial to us.\"It's early, but he feels the present day iteration of Lamb along with Pickens is an even more explosive and versatile duo than early-career Lamb and Pro Bowl wide receiver Amari Cooper were for him in the early 2020's.\"CeeDee was young, and he was more just in the slot. We weren't asking him to get out there, and he hadn't mastered the position I would say the position quite as he has. These two guys, young guys, ... have figured it out. ... It's electric,\" Prescott said. \"You got two playmakers like that that have the range. They can beat anybody with their speed down the field. Any 50/50 catch over one guy, over two guys. Whatever it is, it just makes it fun. It makes my job a whole lot easier and excited to see them both out there. The best part of it is they're each other's biggest fans. They're each other's biggest supporters. ... So we just got to find a way to spread out 20 balls and four touchdowns [between them].\"\nBack in May at Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray's charity softball game, Lamb's college teammate at Oklahoma, Lamb said he and Pickens \"both ones.\" He doubled down on that message on Thursday. \"I was like 'you got two ones.' I don't think everybody believed me until one of us went down, and then you saw [it],\" Lamb said. \"So it's kind of like proved me right and proved everybody else wrong about who he is. His humility, the presence he brings to this team and to his game. He's a dominant receiver, and he's a very exciting player.\"\"I honestly don't mind seeing him run 60 yards, 30 yards and taking a slant to the crib. Any given play man, he's a heck of a player,\" Lamb continued. \"He can catch the ball. His [catch] radius is crazy. The things that he does after the plays. You just got to watch him. He's a character. He's amazing.\"\nThat level of amazing has helped Prescott soar to amazing heights his current 71.6% completion rate would rank as the highest in NFL history by a player who also led the league in pass attempts, according to NFL Pro. Prescott leads the NFL with 229 passing attempts entering Week 7. Much of his top five-caliber production has come with Lamb, center Cooper Beebe (ankle), left tackle Tyler Guyton (concussion), right guard Tyler Booker (ankle) and wide receiver KaVontae Turpin (foot) all missing time over the first six weeks of the season. Despite all that, Dallas enters Week 7 as the NFL's No. 3 scoring offense (29.7 points per game) and No. 1 total offense (387.5 total yards per game).\"That's Dak being Dak man. ... He's an overcomer. He's a conqueror,\" Lamb said. \"With him, he'll have his guys ready to run through a wall. It wasn't just me. He missed out on his o-linemen.  ... A lot of playmakers, and Dak being able to still Dak, that's the best thing about it. But when you get us back, hopefully I can help and so can Turp.\"  Dak Prescott This Season, NFL RanksNFL RankCompletion Percentage71.6%4thPass Attempts2291stCompletions 1641stPass Yards1,6172ndPass TD132ndPasser Rating104.69thSack Rate3.0%3rdCompletions of 25-Plus Yards171stGoing to bat with Jerry JonesCowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said on Tuesday that he is weighing the idea of setting aside salary cap space to extend Pickens. Pickens himself said he \"wouldn't mind\" re-signing with Dallas. Both Prescott and Lamb plan to find time to chat with Jones before the start of next offseason to make their feelings clear that they want Pickens to be their teammate for the foreseeable future. \"Yeah, some sort [of way]. Hasn't happened yet. I've been a little busy, but it will,\" Prescott said of talking to Jones on Pickens' behalf. … \"When I run into him in that time of privacy, I'll make sure.\"  \"My answer is pretty obvious. I think I made that clear when I first came here: there is no ego here. I need him to get that [bag],\" Lamb said, affirming he will talk with Jones about Pickens. \"I hope he gets everything that he deserves here and just continue to do what we do.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the midst of a second outstanding season in as many years, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti earned himself a raise. Cignetti and the Hoosiers agreed to terms on a contract extension that bumps his average annual pay by $3.6 million and adds another year onto his deal, Indiana announced. It is an eight-year contract with an annual $11.6 million salary that runs through the end of the 2033 regular season.The timing of Cignetti's extension is particularly notable because of his potential candidacy for the Penn State job. When the Nittany Lions last weekend fired James Franklin, Cignetti's name immediately popped up on hot boards because of his rising stardom and ties to the region. His new contract seemingly indicates that Penn State will have to look elsewhere for its next coach.\"My wife Manette and I love Indiana University, Bloomington, the state of Indiana and the people that we've met,\" Cignetti said in a video. \"We have very strong feelings about President Whitten and Scott Dolson. We've accomplished a lot here in a short amount of time but still have a lot of work to do. I couldn't be more proud to be a Hoosier, and I plan on retiring as a Hoosier. The way that this state has embraced us and our success in football has meant more to me than anything else. I just wanted to get on camera and let you know that Curt Cignetti is going to work daily to make Indiana the best it can be.\"This is Cignetti's second contract extension in less than a calendar year. He inked an eight-year, $64 million deal in the final weeks of his debut season with the Hoosiers, during which he led the program to its first double-digit win total and a berth in the College Football Playoff.\n\"At Indiana University, we are committed to performing at the highest levels in everything we do, and no one has exemplified that more than coach Cignetti,\" Indiana University president Pamela Whitten said. \"Put simply, Cig is a winner. From last year's College Football Playoff appearance to this year's top-3 national ranking, the IU Football program's success has been tremendous. Curt and Manette Cignetti are home in Indiana and we are delighted that the Cignetti family will be Hoosiers for many years to come.\"Indiana is off to an unbeaten start to Cignetti's second year. The Hoosiers secured the biggest victory of his tenure last week and, perhaps, the most impressive win by any team this season -- a 30-20 triumph at No. 3 Oregon. The victory sent Indiana further up the AP Top 25 rankings and into the No. 3 spot the Ducks held before the Week 7 clash. The Hoosiers also picked up three first-place votes.\n\"We are committed to investing in IU Football in such a way that we can compete at a championship level, and the No. 1 priority in doing that is ensuring that Coach Cignetti is the leader of our program,\" athletic director Scott Dolson said. \"His accomplishments during the last season and a half have been nothing short of remarkable.  As much as anyone, he believed in what was possible with our program, and he's turned that belief into reality. This is a great day for IU Football and Indiana University. I look forward to working alongside Coach Cignetti for many years to come.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The two teams who met in last season's Western Conference Finals will get reacquainted on Thursday's NBA schedule as the Oklahoma City Thunder visit the Minnesota Timberwolves. OKC (38-10) won that West Finals series in five games and is coming off a 104-95 victory over New Orleans on Tuesday. Minnesota (29-19) has won back-to-back outings, most recently defeating Dallas, 118-105, on Wednesday. Guard Jalen Williams (hamstring) is out for Oklahoma City. Tipoff is at 9:30 p.m. ET from the Target Center in Minneapolis. These teams have alternated wins and losses over their last eight regular-season matchups, with the Wolves prevailing in the last meeting. The latest Timberwolves vs. Thunder odds have OKC as 7.5-point favorites per DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 224.5.

The Thunder lead the league in scoring and rank among the top three in field goal percentage, 2-point percentage and free throw percentage. As for the Wolves, they own the No. 5 scoring offense and also boast top-5 rankings in field goal percentage and 3-point percentage.OKC will be without defensive ace Alex Caruso (adductor) and All-Defensive member in Jalen Williams, while Cason Wallace (hip), who ranks second in the NBA with 2.1 steals per game, is questionable. That's lots of firepower on the defensive end for the Thunder, which is why the model projects them to allow nearly 5 more points than their regular season average. With that, the teams are projected to combine for 228 points as the Over hits 51.8% of the time.It has also generated an against-the-spread pick that hits over 50% of simulations. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. \nSo who wins Thunder vs. Wolves, and which side of the spread hits over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Timberwolves vs. Thunder spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

For the first time in the history of The Big Game, each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup. New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Australian Open men's semifinals begin at 10:30 p.m. ET on Thursday night, as Carlos Alcaraz faces Alexander Zverev. Alcaraz had never gone beyond the quarterfinals in four previous visits, but he has reached the semifinals without dropping a set. He had won 36 of his last 37 Grand Slam sets, and he is a -700 favorite against Zverev on Thursday night. SportsLine tennis expert Jose Onorato is taking the Over (35.5) for that match, and he has also revealed an Australian Open best bet for Novak Djokovic vs. Jannik Sinner.    Sinner is the defending champion while Djokovic is a 10-time winner, setting up a blockbuster showdown at 3:30 a.m. ET on Friday morning.

Long service games, a potential tiebreak, or a four-set battle all come into play here. Even if Alcaraz is the one pulling away late, Zverev can do enough early to push this total past the number.\"New users can get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet with the latest FanDuel promo code. You can claim the offer here:\nSinner -2.5 sets vs. Djokovic (-130)\"Sinner has completely taken control of this rivalry, winning the last five meetings and doing so convincingly, including three straight-set wins,\" Onorato said. \"His level in Melbourne has once again been flawless. He is the two-time defending champion, riding a 20-match winning streak at the Australian Open, and has not dropped a set in this tournament. Sinner has dictated from the baseline with depth and pace, consistently taking time away from opponents and forcing errors early in rallies. \"Djokovic, on the other hand, has not looked like the same physical force we are used to seeing in Melbourne. His path to the semifinals was helped by Musetti's retirement, and even before that his movement and consistency showed cracks, especially in longer exchanges. Against Sinner, those margins matter. Sinner's improved serve, elite returning, and ability to absorb and redirect pace neutralize Djokovic's strengths and push him into defensive positions. Unless Djokovic finds a level we have not yet seen, this matchup strongly favors Sinner controlling the match from the start.\"New users can get a first bet matched up to $250 with the latest Caesars promo code.

    "body": "\n        Bill Belichick belongs in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but that time hasn't come yet due to the selection process, according to Vahe Gregorian of the Kansas City Star, who revealed himself Wednesday as one of the voters who was against first-ballot enshrinement. Gregorian directed his opinion toward the voting process and \"curious selection dynamics\" based on \"illogical\" candidate groupings. Gregorian said he didn't vote \"against\" Belichick or Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\"I voted for the three senior candidates: Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood,\" Gregorian wrote. \"You could call that rationalizing, I suppose. And I'm suddenly reminded of the fortune cookie wisdom that you should never try to explain, since your friends don't need it and your enemies won't believe it anyway.\"\n        \n            \n                How did Bill Belichick get snubbed?

I can't and won't try to speak for others, and it's a condition of being a voter to not divulge the deliberations,\" he wrote. \"But the so-called 'cheating stuff' is not at all the only possible explanation. Because it certainly didn't ultimately influence my vote.\"Belichick fell short of the 40 votes needed from the 50-person selection committee to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.Voters could cast votes for three of the five finalists and Belichick's snub became a major source of controversy.\nTom Brady and Kraft were among those leading voices who denounced Belichick's snub. Belichick became eligible this year because he has not coached in the NFL since 2023. North Carolina's football coach will be back up for nomination as part of the 2027 class.\"I don't understand it,\" Brady said during a Seattle Sports radio appearance. \"I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer. Which is completely ridiculous, because people deserve it. He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm taking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl, give me one season, I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The coaching carousel this offseason has been the most entertaining merry-go-round of NFL drama in years. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons, Mike Tomlin stepped down after 19 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Buffalo Bills parted ways with Sean McDermott following their divisional-round loss to the Denver Broncos.With new head coaches come new staffs, and sometimes the coordinator hires can be just as important as the top job. Just look at what happened with the Detroit Lions last year. Some of these assistants will be called upon to lead their side of the ball, like Brian Flores with the Minnesota Vikings' defense or Klint Kubiak with the Seattle Seahawks' offense.There has been plenty of coordinator turnover over the past few weeks. Below, CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Bryan DeArdo attempt to grade every coordinator hire from around the NFL.Remaining openingsOffensive coordinator (10): Cardinals, Ravens, Bills, Browns, Broncos, Raiders, Giants, Jets, Eagles, Steelers\nDefensive coordinator (10): Cardinals, Ravens, Bills, Browns, Chargers, Raiders, Dolphins, Steelers, 49ers, Titans\n\n        \n            \n                NFL coaching grades are in: Bills make lukewarm hire with Joe Brady while Harbaugh, Minter lead the class\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Tommy ReesGrade: CDajani: The Atlanta Browns? Kevin Stefanski isn't exploring other offensive coordinator options, as he's bringing his OC with him to the Falcons. The former Notre Dame quarterback spent the past two years in Cleveland, working as a pass-game specialist and tight ends coach before earning a promotion to offensive coordinator in 2025.Stefanski handed off play-calling duties to Rees in the middle of last season, as Cleveland again struggled to find consistency at quarterback. Ultimately, the Browns finished third-worst in total offense (262.1 yards per game) and second-worst in scoring (16.4 points per game).\nBrowns fans probably weren't too sad to lose Rees. Was the problem in Cleveland the coaching staff and play-calling? Or the personnel? We'll find out soon enough.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Christian ParkerGrade: BDeArdo: If you take Cooper DeJean's word for it, the Cowboys found a gem in the 34-year-old Parker, who helped the Eagles win a Super Bowl as part of veteran defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's staff. The fact that Dallas is prying a rising coach away from a division rival only makes the move look even better.Parker has a diverse background, having already served on coaching staffs in Philadelphia, Denver and Green Bay. He cut his teeth as a quality control coach before rising to defensive backs coach and passing game coordinator.\nParker may blossom into the NFL's next elite coordinator, but the Cowboys are taking a risk, especially with head coach Brian Schottenheimer being an offensive-minded leader. That said, it's a risk worth taking for a franchise desperate to reach its first conference title game since 1995.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Drew PetzingGrade: C+DeArdo: This is definitely an under-the-radar hire for the Lions, but Petzing may have been the best available offensive coordinator who wasn't in the mix for a head-coaching job.While he's only 36, Petzing has 16 years of coaching experience, including 12 in the NFL. He spent five years with the Vikings before working three seasons on Kevin Stefanski's staff in Cleveland. Petzing served as Kyler Murray's quarterbacks coach in 2022 before being named the Cardinals' offensive coordinator in 2023.\nLate in the 2023 season, Petzing's offense spearheaded Arizona's upset win over the Steelers in Pittsburgh, a game that included 105 rushing yards and two touchdowns from James Conner. Injuries to Conner and Murray played a major role in Petzing's offense never reaching its full potential. He'll now get a fresh start in Detroit with an offense that isn't short on skill players.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Jonathan GannonGrade: A-Dajani: The social media reaction to this hiring was puzzling. Packers fans know Gannon is being hired as a defensive coordinator, not a head coach, right?The Cardinals fired Gannon after he went 15-36 over three seasons, but he was widely regarded as one of the league's best coordinators during his time with the Eagles. During Philadelphia's run to Super Bowl LVII, the defense ranked in the top eight in points allowed per game, total yards allowed per game and sacks with Gannon calling plays.\nThis could be a nice fit for Micah Parsons. Maybe Gannon wasn't the best lead man, but he's an experienced defensive mind who has held this role before.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Eric BieniemyGrade: B-DeArdo: Like an old sitcom trying to relive its glory days, the Chiefs are clearly hoping Bieniemy can help them get back to what they once were.From a familiarity standpoint, this makes a ton of sense. While his tough love coaching style isn't for everyone, Bieniemy clearly has a strong working relationship with Patrick Mahomes, and that's a big deal. If Bieniemy can help Mahomes return to MVP form, that's what matters most.\nThat said, a coach is only as good as his players. Travis Kelce will be 37 next season, and Mahomes will be 31. Kansas City also doesn't have anyone who can replicate what Tyreek Hill gave them during their first Super Bowl run. In short, Bieniemy will have to adjust to what the Chiefs are now, not what they used to be.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Mike McDanielGrade: A+Dajani: Mike McDaniel was the belle of the ball in this year's offensive coordinator cycle. Say what you want about McDaniel as a lead man, but he could be one of the best offensive coordinators in the NFL right away for the Chargers.In 2023, he used Tua Tagovailoa to power the league's No. 1 offense, as Miami averaged 401.3 total yards per game. Yes, that production eventually fell off, but the way McDaniel schemed up touches for his running backs really stood out. Remember when Raheem Mostert led the NFL with 18 rushing touchdowns at 31 years old?\nAnd we all know the speedy De'Von Achane is one of the league's best weapons. His 5.62 yards per carry are the second-most by a running back in NFL history. Whether running the ball or throwing it, McDaniel knows how to create explosive plays. In fact, he's registered the seventh-most team yards per play (5.78) among head coaches in the Super Bowl era.Imagine what he's going to be able to do with Justin Herbert and Omarion Hampton.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Bobby SlowikGrade: A-Dajani: Slowik deserves another chance after his stint with the Houston Texans. You'll remember he helped C.J. Stroud win Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2023, as the No. 2 overall pick posted the highest TD-to-INT ratio against winning teams in NFL history in his first season, including the playoffs (21-2). Stroud also became the youngest quarterback to win a playoff game in NFL history.\nHowever, Slowik failed to adjust and improve his scheme. The Texans offense ranked 12th in total yards (342.4 per game) and tied for 13th in points per game (22.2) in 2023, but slipped to 22nd in yards (319.7 per game) and 19th in scoring (21.9) in 2024, which led to his firing.After watching how Stroud has fared over the past two years, it looks like Slowik was the best offensive mind Houston had in the DeMeco Ryans era. After spending last season as the Dolphins' senior passing game coordinator, Slowik is back leading an offense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Dennard WilsonGrade: B+Dajani: At face value, hiring the former defensive coordinator of the Titans doesn't sound great. After all, the Giants' last defensive coordinator also came from Tennessee, and that didn't go so well. But Dennard Wilson is highly respected and has a strong connection to John Harbaugh.\nWilson helped the Eagles reach Super Bowl LVII as a passing game coordinator and defensive backs coach, relying on Darius Slay, James Bradberry and C.J. Gardner-Johnson. He then went to Baltimore as the Ravens' defensive backs coach and watched that defense become the first team in NFL history to lead the league in points allowed per game (16.5), sacks (60) and takeaways (31).Wilson got his first shot as a defensive coordinator with the Titans in 2024, and his unit ranked second in total defense despite a 3-14 record. Tennessee slipped to 21st this past season, but Wilson was applauded for getting the most out of a banged-up group. Now, he lands in New York.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Defensive coordinator: Brian Duker Grade: C+DeArdo: This makes sense from a familiarity standpoint, as Duker and Jets head coach Aaron Glenn spent three years together on the Lions' coaching staff.Duker has never been a play-caller, so this hire likely indicates that Glenn will handle defensive play-calling for the Jets this season. That will give Duker a chance to manage other responsibilities on that side of the ball without the added burden of calling plays.It seems Glenn wanted someone he knows and trusts as he takes on his new role as defensive play-caller. If that was the goal, it's hard to be overly critical of the hire.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Zac RobinsonGrade: B+DeArdo: This has the potential to be a really good hire for the Buccaneers for several reasons.Robinson, 39, is familiar with Tampa Bay after facing the Bucs twice a year over the past two seasons as the Falcons' offensive coordinator. Perhaps more importantly, he has extensive knowledge of other defenses in the NFC South.In Atlanta, Robinson consistently put his best players in positions to succeed. Under his watch, Bijan Robinson became arguably the NFL's top running back while breaking the Falcons' single-season total yardage record. Wideout Drake London and Kyle Pitts also enjoyed considerable success in Robinson's offense.Consistency at quarterback was one of the biggest things that eluded Robinson during his time in Atlanta. Now, he'll get a chance to work with Baker Mayfield at a pivotal point in Mayfield's career.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: Brian DabollGrade: B+DeArdo: While his time as the Giants' head coach was largely disappointing, Daboll does have a strong background as an offensive coordinator, including a proven track record with young quarterbacks.Daboll worked exceptionally well with Josh Allen during their time together in Buffalo. In two years, Allen went from a struggling starter to one of the NFL's best quarterbacks.Daboll also got quite a bit out of Daniel Jones in New York. Jones helped lead the Giants to their first playoff win since Super Bowl XLVI, and Daboll also maximized the talents of Saquon Barkley before his departure.Daboll will now get a chance to mentor another young quarterback in Cam Ward, who played well during his rookie season despite less-than-ideal circumstances.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Offensive coordinator: David BloughGrade: C-Dajani: This is a massive gamble for Dan Quinn. After an incredible 12-5 campaign in 2024, the Commanders finished 5-12 this past season. You can try to blame it on Jayden Daniels missing 10 starts, but he didn't look like a superstar in the games he did play, winning just two of them.With Kliff Kingsbury out, Washington moved questionably quickly to promote a 30-year-old former quarterback who has never called plays to lead the offense.I'm sure Daniels loves Blough, and he absolutely deserves a fair shot. But if he can't find a way to spark this offense right away, could Quinn lose his job? After watching one-third of the NFL change head coaches, I'm not ruling anything out.Defensive coordinator: Daronte JonesGrade: BDajani: Daronte Jones is a Maryland native who returns to Washington after spending the past four seasons with the Vikings as their defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator. He's worked with defensive backs at a number of stops, including Nicholls State, UCLA, the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL, Hawaii, Wisconsin, the Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals. He also had a one-year stint as LSU's defensive coordinator in 2021.ESPN reported that Jones interviewed with at least five different teams for defensive coordinator openings, but Quinn was able to land him. While he's not exactly a household name, Jones has worked under Brian Flores, Vance Joseph and Mike Zimmer.\n            ",

The former Patriots coach, who won six Super Bowls in New England, was widely expected to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, but that won't be happening this year. So how did arguably the greatest coach in NFL history get left out? To understand that, you have to break down the voting process, which is a little complicated, so let's walk through it. There are 50 members of the Hall of Fame selection committee. The committee is made up mostly of media members, along with several Hall of Fame coaches, front-office members and players.To be enshrined this year, Belichick needed at least 40 votes.Belichick was competing with four other finalists for a spot in Canton. He was up against the three senior finalists (Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood), along with one contributor finalist (Patriots owner Robert Kraft).Each member of the selection committee is allowed to vote for up to three candidates. Members are not asked to rank them. If a candidate's name appears on a ballot, that counts as a vote.Since Belichick didn't make it, that means he was left off at least 11 ballots.The voting is done in secret, and the Hall of Fame does not disclose how anyone votedBasically, there's no accountability or transparency in the process. CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones has called for the entire system to be blown up. \nThe Hall of Fame has a full list of the 50-person selection committee on its website, and although ballots are supposed to remain secret, several committee members have come out and revealed whether they voted for Belichick. The committee includes one media member from each city that has an NFL team (32 total). There's also one member representing the PFWA, along with 17 at-large voters. Let's take a look at the full list, including members who have publicly said they voted for Belichick, and those who have not revealed their ballots. \nCommittee members who have publicly said they voted for Belichick: Arizona: Kent Somers, retired Arizona RepublicBuffalo: Vic Carucci, WGRZ-TVChicago: Dan Pompei, The AthleticCleveland: Tony Grossi, ESPNCleveland.com/WKNR RadioDetroit: Dave Birkett, Detroit Free PressGreen Bay: Pete Dougherty, Green Bay Press-GazetteHouston: John McClain, SportsRadio610Los Angeles (Chargers): Eric Williams, Sports IllustratedMiami: Armando Salguero, Outkick.comNew York (Giants): Gary Myers, AuthorNew York (Jets): Rich Cimini, ESPN.comPhiladelphia: Paul Domowitch, The33rdTeam.com/PhillyMag.comPittsburgh: Gerry Dulac, Pittsburgh Post-GazetteSeattle: Mike Sando, The AthleticTennessee: Paul Kuharsky, PaulKuharsky.comWashington: Jarrett Bell, USA TODAYPFWA: Calvin Watkins, Dallas Morning NewsAt-Large: Mary Kay-Cabot, Cleveland Plain DealerAt-Large: Jason Cole, FanSided.comAt-Large: Lindsay Jones, The RingerAt-Large: Sal Paolantonio, ESPNAt-Large: Charean Williams, Pro Football TalkCommittee members who have publicly said they did NOT vote for Belichick:Kansas City: Vahe Gregorian, Kansas City StarCommittee members whose votes are unknown:Atlanta: Darryl Ledbetter, Atlanta Journal-ConstitutionCincinnati, Geoff Hobson, Bengals.com Dallas: Rick Gosselin, Talk of Fame NetworkDenver: Jeff Legwold, ESPN/ESPN.comIndianapolis: Mike Chappell, Fox 59/CBS 4Jacksonville: Sam Kouvaris, SamSportsLine.comLas Vegas: Paul Gutierrez, Raiders.com Los Angeles (Rams): Howard Balzer, SiriusXM NFL RadioMinnesota: Mark Craig, The Minneapolis Star-TribuneNew England: Ron Borges, Talk of Fame NetworkNew Orleans: Jeff Duncan, Times-PicayuneSan Francisco: Matt Maiocco, NBC Sports Bay AreaTampa Bay: Ira Kaufman, JoeBucsFan.comAt-Large: Joe Bussert, retired, NFL OfficeAt-Large: Frank Cooney, The Sports XchangeAt-Large: Tony Dungy, NBC Sports \"Football Night in America\" (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Dan Fouts, Broadcaster (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Clark Judge, Talk of Fame NetworkAt-Large: Ross Ketover, NFL FilmsAt-Large: James Lofton, CBS Sports (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Alex Marvez, SiriusXM NFL RadioAt-Large: Bill Polian, SiriusXM NFL Radio (Hall of Famer)At-Large: Lisa Salters, ESPN At-Large: Jim Trotter, retired, The AthleticAt-Large: Barry Wilner, retired, Associated PressCommittee members who won't be revealing their voteCarolina: Darin Gantt, Carolina PanthersBaltimore: Scott Garceau, 105.7 The Fan/WMAR-TVOut of the group of 50, more than 20 members have already come out and said they voted for Belichick.We also know that at least 11 voters did NOT vote for him. Mike Sando of The Athletic outlined how that might have happened: Some voters could have been turned off by the Spygate allegations, while others might have prioritized the senior candidates, who may not make the final ballot next year. It's also possible some voters weren't thrilled with the recent rule change that made former coaches eligible after just one year out of the league. CBS Sports NFL researcher Doug Clawson also came up with some theories about why certain voters might have left Belichick off their ballots. It's not just Spygate -- there was also Deflategate. And let's not forget, the Patriots were fined $1.1 million for filming the Bengals sideline in 2019. \n\n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick snubbed by Hall of Fame: We now can't rule out the possibility of Tom Brady meeting same fate\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThen there's the Bill Polian factor. In a story Tuesday, ESPN reported that Polian tried to convince a few other voters that Belichick deserved to wait at least one year as a punishment for Spygate. The former Colts general manager told Sports Illustrated on Tuesday that he definitely voted for Belichick, but then backtracked later in the night, telling ESPN that he was 95% sure he voted for him. The Hall of Fame vote took place Jan. 13, and if Polian can't remember after just two weeks, that opens up another set of issues. The only committee member who has publicly admitted to leaving Belichick off his ballot is Vahe Gregorian of the Kansas City Star, who wrote an article explaining why he left the the six-time Super Bowl winner off his ballot. \n\"I didn't vote against Belichick or Kraft. I voted for the three senior candidates: Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood,\" Gregorian wrote. As Sando mentioned, there was almost certainly going to be a faction of voters who prioritized getting the senior nominees in and that's what Gregorian did. For the senior nominees, this could be their last shot at making the Hall of Fame and that clearly factored into Gregorian's decision. On the other hand, Belichick will almost certainly be a finalist next year, so Gregorian didn't feel pressed to put him in this year whether he was deserving or not. If other voters went the same route as Gregorian, then Belichick not getting in is less of a snub and more of a flaw in the selection process. And if that's the case, then the Hall will need to think long and hard about the process going forward. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

It's Austin Nivison kicking off your Thursday with the biggest and best stories from around the sports world. Giannis Antetokounmpo kicked the NBA trade rumor mill into high gear, the Browns have a new coach and there is more drama involving the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Let's get right to it, shall we?  😲 Five things to know Thursday Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo is open to a trade. The two sides tried to hold on for as long as they could, but with the news that Antetokounmpo is ready to move on, it's time for the rumor mill to reach a fever pitch. The two-time MVP should fetch a blockbuster return, and with just days until the trade deadline arrives, a deal could materialize sooner rather than later.The Browns hire Todd Monken. After spending three seasons in the AFC North as the offensive coordinator for the Ravens, Monken is staying in the division as the next coach of the Browns. The 60-year-old Monken will get his first crack at being a head coach after helping Lamar Jackson elevate his game in Baltimore, but this hire does come with risks.Eli Manning falls short of the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his second ballot. One day after Bill Belichick's stunning Hall of Fame snub, Manning missed the Hall of Fame cut on his second opportunity. Manning, one of six players to own multiple Super Bowl MVPs, is one of the most complicated cases in Hall of Fame history. Now he'll have wait at least one more year to reach Canton. Speaking of that Belichick snub, Tom Brady and Robert Kraft are still scratching their heads.Patrick Reed is eyeing PGA Tour reinstatement in 2027. The 2018 Masters champ, Reed announced he will apply for PGA Tour reinstatement in 2027. Reed's LIV Golf contract expired at the end of the 2025 campaign, and he will compete on the DP World Tour. On Aug. 25, 2026, Reed will become eligible to compete in PGA Tour events as a non-member, since that will be one year since his last LIV Golf event. Brooks Koepka is returning to the PGA Tour in 2026, and he discussed that at length this week.The Rangers are preparing to trade Artemi Panarin. After seven seasons, the \"Bread Man\" era in New York appears to be over. The Rangers are prepared to hold Panarin out of the lineup until the Olympic break on Feb. 6 -- or until a trade materializes. Panarin immediately becomes the biggest fish on the trade market, and there are a handful of teams that would be perfect fits for the Russian superstar. 🏀 Do not miss this: Giannis Antetokounmpo trade destinations \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Bucks GM Jon Horst will be a very popular man over the next few days. To put it more accurately, Giannis Antetokounmpo will be a very popular man because every NBA title hopeful will be trying to acquire him. That being the case, our own Sam Quinn put together a list of the nine teams that could add Antetokounmpo between now and the summer. Perhaps the most high-profile destination is the Knicks, but they do have some hurdles to clear in order to make it happen. Despite those obstacles, if Giannis wants to wind up in New York, then he may be able to force his way there. Quinn: \"If Giannis wants the Knicks, he's probably going to have to stick his thumb on the scale. Maybe, just maybe, he can scare off other suitors by letting them know he'd only re-sign in New York. And maybe, just maybe, the Bucks could talk themselves into a star they could put on billboards as they sort through the wreckage of a post-Giannis future. There are a lot of maybes here. When the star wants a certain team, though, that team always has a reasonable shot.\"Even if the Knicks don't acquire Antetokounmpo before the trade deadline, Karl-Anthony Towns may be on his way out, but that alone may not solve the team's defensive issues.  🏈 Grading second-year CFB coaches \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            When it comes to evaluating football coaches, it's always fun to review first-year coaches, but they haven't had much time to establish a culture or turn over the roster. You can glean more information from a coach's second year on the job, and it makes it easier to grade their job performance. That's exactly what our team of college football experts did as they doled out grades for each second-year sideline boss, and I think they were more than fair. Take their review of Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer, who earned a \"C+.\" He did lead the Crimson Tide to the College Football Playoff, but the team didn't exactly look like the juggernaut of days gone by, as Shehan Jeyarajah writes. Jeyarajah: \"There were legitimate steps forward in DeBoer's second season -- and serious steps back.

When you look at the play and you're trying to evaluate it — the operating surgeon said that this was going to happen sooner than later.\"Nix contradicted Payton's statements Wednesday, calling his injury a \"typical bone break\" that was nothing out of the ordinary.\"Nothing predisposed, nothing that was there originally,'' Nix said, via 9news' Mike Klis. \"That might have gotten confused. Just a simple step with my foot up in the air, my body weight came down on it, sort of got twisted up.\"\nNix expects to be back on the field in 4-6 weeks and prefers that Payton not discuss his medical history publicly.\"I don't think he really should share how many surgeries I've had in the past, to be honest with you — he doesn't even really know that,\" Nix said. \"But it's going to be good to get back, get back to work. … Nothing really that concerns me, nothing that scares me moving forward.\"\nNix finished with 3,931 yards, 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while attempting a league-high 612 passes. Denver substituted Jarrett Stidham in for the AFC Championship Game, which ended in a 10-7 loss as the New England Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James returned to a familiar place on Wednesday when his team faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. The 41-year-old, of course, is an Akron, Ohio, native and began his NBA career with the Cavaliers when the franchise drafted him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft.With James playing his 23rd NBA season -- and the Lakers having only one scheduled trip to Cleveland this year -- the franchise gave him a proper welcome home tribute. Midway through the first quarter, the Cavaliers showed highlights of James scoring 25 consecutive points against the Detroit Pistons in the 2007 Eastern Conference finals. That series was ultimately won by the Cavs, helping the franchise secure a ticket to the NBA Finals.During the video tribute, James appeared to tear up. After the video played and before James returned to the court, he was shown wiping his eyes with a towel.\nAfter the game, a 129-99 loss, James said he was \"more present\" for this particular tribute than his past appearances as a visitor in Cleveland. \n\"I think it comes from just being present. I was more present today than the previous seven,\" James said. \"Definitely got to me a little bit. For sure. I was super thankful.\"\nWith the game out of hand in the second half, Bronny James -- LeBron's son and a deep reserve for the Lakers -- got some rare playing time down the stretch. He made the most of it in eight minutes, scoring eight points on a fastbreak dunk and a pair of 3-pointers. The elder James was appreciative of the moment and made note of the reception Bronny received from the Cleveland fans.\"It's a homecoming for him. Just to see him get that dunk, hit a couple shots, get the ovation from the fans -- pretty cool moment for him, for us as a family, for my wife and his siblings,\" James said. \"My mom is here watching her son and her grandson. It's so weird and so cool and so surreal. My mom gets to watch her son and her grandson play in the NBA at the same time.\"\nJames spent 11 seasons with the Cavaliers across two stints with the franchise. James helped Cleveland win the 2016 NBA Finals over the Golden State Warriors after battling back from a 3-1 deficit. James left Cleveland as a free agent in 2018 to join the Lakers.With James' retirement timeline unclear, this could mark his final time playing in Cleveland if he steps away after the 2025-26 season. However, ESPN reported in November that James is unsure if this will be his last season or if he will play at least one more.\nJames is averaging 22.4 points, 6.7 assists and 6.0 rebounds in 33.4 minutes per game. James has appeared in 28 games this season after missing the first month due to sciatica.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open begins on Thursday with a strong field headed to the Torrey Pines South Course in San Diego. Scottie Scheffler, who won his 2026 season debut at The American Express, isn't playing this week, opening up the field a bit for big names such as Xander Schueffele, Ludvig Aberg and Patrick Cantlay. Schauffele, the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 6 in the OWGR, is the +1300 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds from FanDuel Sportsbook. Aberg is close behind at +1700, followed by Cantlay at +1900 and Cameron Young at +2000.Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka is a +6000 longshot as he makes his PGA Tour return after recently leaving LIV Golf, while defending winner, Harris English, is at +3500. The first tee times come at 12:10 p.m. ET. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open 2026 picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its golf betting picks since that point, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Farmers Insurance Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the Farmers Insurance Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites, stumbles and falls well out of the top 5. He's a golfer to fade this week. Kim is off to a hot start this season with a T11 at the Sony Open and a T6 at The American Express last week. He was in the final group on Sunday before before a fourth-round 72. This event has been a struggle for Kim, however, as he has no top-10 finishes in eight tries and has missed the cut twice in his last appearances at this tournament. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Cantlay one of the best betting values this week. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. He finished T13 at The American Express with four sub-70 rounds. The California native doesn't have a great track record at this event, but he did shoot a first-round 65 last year at Torrey Pines before struggling over the weekend. The model is projecting a more consistent effort for him this year and has him as one of its top 2026 Farmers Insurance Open contenders as McClure says \"Cantlay is a core outright bet target this week.\" See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Farmers Insurance Open picksThe model is targeting several other longshots, including a massive +28000 underdog who is \"the best positive EV longshot on the board.\" You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        The NFL world was shocked when news broke on Tuesday that former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick did not receive the required vote to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first attempt. CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones confirmed the news that the current North Carolina football coach did not receive the 40 out of 50 votes needed to reach the Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot.This was Belichick's first year of eligibility since he had not coached in the NFL since 2023.Belichick, who won eight total Super Bowls (two as an assistant with the Giants, six as a head coach with the Patriots), is second all-time among NFL coaches with 333 career wins. That number only trails two-time Super Bowl winner and Hall of Famer Don Shula, who has 347 career wins.\n        \n            \n                Legendary former Patriots coach Bill Belichick falls short of Pro Football Hall of Fame on first ballot\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes was among the names who spoke out after the repot. Mahomes posted on social that the decision was \"insane\" and that he doesn't understand \"how this could be possible.\" Notably, Mahomes and the Chiefs faced the Patriots in the 2019 AFC Championship Game. New England went on to win that game in overtime, paving the way for Belichick to win his sixth title as a head coach weeks later.\nEven NBA superstar LeBron James was confused by the report, saying that it was \"disrespectful.\"\nLawrence Taylor, whom Belichick has called the greatest defensive player in NFL history, called his former coach's exclusion from the Hall of Fame \"total bulls---.\" Taylor and Belichick won two Super Bowls together during their time with the New York Giants. \nFormer NFL defensive back Darius Butler, who played for Belichick during the 2009 and 2010 campaigns, also spoke out, citing that if he isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, then \"who is?\"\nFormer NFL star JJ Watt, who will be a future Hall of Famer one day, said there shouldn't be a \"single world\" that Belichick is not a \"First-Ballot Hall of Famer.\"\nFormer NFL defensive back Ryan Clark posted on social media that if Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer, \"no coach should be.\"\nFormer NFL defensive tackle Gerald McCoy said the voters need to be made public after the former Patriots coach did not receive 40 of the 50 votes needed.\nFormer NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III said that Belichick \"earned\" the right to be a first ballot Hall of Famer. \nOne of the members of the Hall's voting committee is former NFL general manager Bill Polian. A voter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told ESPN that Polian told some voters he believed Belichick should \"wait a year\" before induction because of Spygate. The 2007 cheating scandal cost the Patriots a first-round pick and Belichick was fined $250,000. Former NFL star Terrell Owens appeared to react to the report on social media shortly after.\nFormer NFL star wide receiver Dez Bryant said he was \"lost for words.\"\nNew Orleans Saints star Cameron Jordan posted on social media that he is normally surprised when people get in the Hall of Fame, not the other way around.\nMore former Patriots players, including Julian Edelman and Jason McCourty, also reacted to the stunning news.\n            ",

Could be a rock fight as the Dragons limit opponents to a conference-best 66.7 points while the Pirates yield 67.8 points. Hampton and Drexel have allowed the fewest field goals in the CAA and the fewest 3-pointers. Hampton has averaged just 63.3 ppg in the past four matchups with Drexel and scored 52 there in a loss last season. One of the Pirates' best players, Michael Eley, is slumping while playing through a toe injury with just 11 combined points in the past two.\" Back Drexel at bet365 here:\nKings +11.5 vs. 76ers (-110)Philadelphia is coming off a 139-122 win over Milwaukee on Tuesday, but that was the 76ers' first win by double digits since Jan. 12. They have lost five of their eight games since then, with three of those setbacks coming at home. Sacramento is on a six-game skid, but it has played several close games during that stretch, including a 123-118 loss at Cleveland last Friday as a 13-point underdog. SportsLine's model expects a similar result on Thursday, as the Kings are covering in 67% of the model's simulations. Back the Kings at bet365 here:Over 214.5 in Pistons vs. Suns (-110)Detroit is tied for tenth in the NBA in points per game (117.2) this season, scoring 139 points against the Kings on Sunday. The Pistons are led by one of the NBA's premier scorers in Cade Cunningham, who is averaging 25.3 points per game. They also rank inside the top half of the league in possessions per game, so this is a low total given the moderate tempo that the game should be played at. These teams have both been trending Under, creating value on the Over due to the low total. The model has the Over cashing 61% of the time, as they combine for 224 points in the latest simulations. Back the Over at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Thursday.

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will meet up in Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX. We don't have to look too far back to remember the last time these franchises squared off on the NFL's biggest stage, doing so in Super Bowl XLIX. That game is best remembered for Malcolm Butler's infamous goal-line interception, making it one of the more memorable Super Bowls of all time. This go around, while the franchises are the same, we have entirely different players and personnel set to duke it out for a Lombardi Trophy, which creates totally new storylines for us to unpack. As we await kickoff of Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8, let's take a gander at some of those narratives and determine if they are overreactions or reality. Sam Darnold has already silenced his doubtersOverreaction vs. reality: Overreaction\nDarnold's career resurrection is one of the great developments over the last two years. He came into the NFL as the No. 3 overall pick of the New York Jets in 2018, but ultimately was not able to live up to that billing. From there, he began bouncing around the league, first landing with Carolina before serving as a backup for the 49ers in 2023. Then, Darnold found himself as the starter for the Minnesota Vikings in 2024, and his career began to do a 180. That season, he led the Vikings to a 14-3 record and into the playoffs after throwing for over 4,300 yards and 35 touchdowns. Darnold signed with Seattle in free agency the following offseason and again had a 4,000-yard passing season while posting another 14-3 record in the regular season, which was good for first place in the NFC West and the No. 1 seed. Now, he has them playing for a championship. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 Super Bowl odds: Seahawks favored over Patriots; Sam Darnold the early MVP favorite over Drake Maye\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nYou'd think all that would have his doubters silenced, right? Well, not quite. There's still the question in the back of people's minds, wondering if Darnold will turn back into a pumpkin at some point. As sensational as he was for Minnesota for the bulk of the 2024 season, he reverted to his old self in Week 18 and then in the playoff loss to Los Angeles over Wild Card Weekend. That's what keeps some from having total confidence in Darnold heading into this Super Bowl, and a strong performance that ends with him hoisting the Lombardi Trophy may be the only way to rid those skeptics for good. Drake Maye's rumored injury will impact his performanceOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionThere's been some online scuttlebutt that Drake Maye is dealing with an injury to his right shoulder. The Patriots signal-caller could be seen sort of nursing his throwing shoulder in the AFC Championship, particularly after a hit from Broncos safety Talanoa Hufanga in the third quarter. \nWhen asked about it on Tuesday during his appearance on WEEI Afternoons, Maye downplayed any shoulder ailment and noted he feels good heading into the Super Bowl.\n\"I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good. We gonna get some extra rest, and really the only thing that's from the game, I think just the build up of throwing for, this is what, almost, including training camp, thirty weeks straight of throwing and four days a week. It can add up. But I've got some extra rest. I'm feeling good, and yeah, ready to go for the Super Bowl,\" Maye said, via Patriots Wire.Given the amount of rest that New England will get between that AFC Championship and the Super Bowl, it's hard to imagine that this possible shoulder injury will have much bearing in the game. That's especially true considering Maye had his best throw of the AFC Championship AFTER that hit from Hufanga, perfectly placing a deep ball to Mack Hollins on a flea-flicker. \nThe fears of this right shoulder injury feel a touch overblown. Patriots offensive slump is flying under the radarOverreaction vs. reality: RealityThe Patriots were able to reach the Super Bowl, but it's not like their offense is firing on all cylinders. Putting any sort of injury to Drake Maye aside, for reasons we just explained above, New England's offense is entering the big game on a little bit of a slump. \nThe unit is averaging just 18.0 points per game this postseason, which is the fewest by a team entering the Super Bowl since the 1979 Rams. Meanwhile, their 4.35 yards per play are the fourth-fewest by any team with three wins entering a Super Bowl all-time, and their 177.7 passing yards per game over that stretch are the fifth-fewest by such a team all-time. If we compare that production to what they did in the regular season, it's a pretty steep drop off. Patriots offenseRegular seasonPostseasonPoints per game28.818.0Yards per game379.4278.3It's worth noting that the Patriots did face some of the top defenses in the NFL over their playoff run in the Chargers, Texans, and Broncos, but they are not going to get any sort of reprieve in Santa Clara when they face Seattle (No. 1 scoring defense in the NFL), so the offense will need to get back on track. New England's playoff defense is an all-time unitOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionIf you look at the numbers, you'd think that the Patriots are coming into this Super Bowl with a defense that will rival some of the all-time great units. After all, they are allowing just 8.7 points per game these playoffs, which is the lowest through three postseason games since the 2000 Ravens. They are also holding opponents to 209.7 yards per game and a 25% red zone touchdown rate this postseason. That's awfully stellar, but we also need to account for the quarterbacks they've faced and the limitations each had if we're going to look at New England accurately.  Over Wild Card Weekend, they faced Justin Herbert without his starting offensive tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt. In the divisional round, C.J. Stroud didn't have his No. 1 wideout Nico Collins due to injury. Then, they faced backup Jarrett Stidham in the AFC Championship after Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the round prior. Don't get us wrong, the Patriots have elevated this postseason defensively, but the eye test doesn't exactly tell us they've elevated to the point of an all-time unit likes stats indicate, particularly with the knowledge of their opponents having a hand tied behind their back in certain respects. Seattle's defense will determine who wins Super Bowl LXOverreaction vs. reality: RealityThe Seattle defense could very well determine who ends up in the winner's circle in Super Bowl LX. They come into this game as the No. 1 scoring defense in the NFL, which is an awfully good place to be if history is any indicator. Since 1970, the No. 1 scoring defenses are 14-4 in the Super Bowl. Seahawks defense this seasonStatsNFL RankPoints per game17.21stYards per rush3.71stYards per attempt5.52ndThird down percentage32%1stSpecifically, this creates quite the chess match between this unit and Drake Maye, who is a candidate for MVP after earning second-team All-Pro honors this season. This will mark the seventh time since 1970 that an All-Pro quarterback will face off against the No. 1 scoring defense in the Super Bowl. The top-scoring defense is 5-1 in those previous six games, and the only win came from Joe Montana in 1989 against the Broncos, where he had five touchdowns and no interceptions. If Maye's Year 2 ascent caps off with a Joe Montana impression, Seattle could be in some trouble. However, if they take care of business and play their typical game, the unit could end up being the MVP of Super Bowl LX. \n            ",

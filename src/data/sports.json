The Steelers are in a good position, sitting a game ahead of the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North, but they likely need to hold that spot to make the postseason. The Lions are unlikely to win their division as they are two games behind the Chicago Bears (10-4) in the NFC North and 1.5 behind the 9-4-1 Green Bay Packers, who are second in the division and hold the final playoff spot.   Kickoff from Ford Field is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Lions are 7-point favorites in the latest Steelers vs. Lions odds at DraftKings, and the over/under for total points scored is 52. Detroit's over/under for total points scored is 30.5, while Pittsburgh's is 21.5.

Pittsburgh is 7-7 but has scored at least 27 points in four of its past five games. The Detroit defense gives up 24.6 points per game (23rd in NFL) and Pittsburgh gives up an average of 25.4 on the road. Steelers vs. Lions SGPLions -7Jahmyr Gibbs Over 74.5 rushing yardsJared Goff Over 263.5 passing yards Bet it at DraftKings:\nModel's Steelers vs. Lions score prediction, picksThe model sees some value in taking the Steelers as plus-money underdogs on the money line, as they are winning in 35% of simulations. Detroit is covering the spread 52% of the time, and the simulations peg the score right on the number. The props model is expecting a big day for the Lions' offensive players, with Goff predicted to throw for 304 yards and Gibbs to rush for almost 91. Goff is averaging 262 yards per game but has topped this total in three of the past four and had a season-high 338 last week. Gibbs entered NFL Week 16 sixth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage and is averaging 5.5 yards per carry.

The Chiefs specifically struggled to stay healthy this season, and that trend continued during their Week 16 showdown with the Tennessee Titans. During the first half, Gardner Minshew -- who started the game in placed of injured starter Patrick Mahomes -- sustained a knee injury that led to him being out for the remainder of the game. Veteran backup Chris Oladokun replaced him and went 6 of 8 for 45 yards in the first half after Minshew went to the locker room. The Titans took a 9-6 lead into intermission. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Oladokun, 28, in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Oladokun signed three years ago after he hit waivers. His only previous regular season experience took place in Week 18 of the 2024 season. He had never thrown a pass in a regular season game prior to Sunday. \nMinshew, 29, is in his first season with the Chiefs, his fourth team over the past five seasons. He earned his first Pro Bowl berth in 2023 after throwing a career-high 3,305 yards in 13 starts with the Indianapolis Colts. \nMahomes sustained a season-ending knee injuring during last week's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that knocked Kansas City out of postseason contention. This season marks the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs. \n            \n    ",

Meanwhile, no team in the NFL has a worse spread record than Baltimore at 5-9, and the Ravens have failed to cover in four of their last five contests. On the field, the Pats have incredible balance, ranking No. 7 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and the team is coming off a season-high of 246 rushing yards on Sunday. Baltimore's run defense is exploitable this year as after ranking No. 1 versus the run in 2024, the team is just 15th this season. In addition to New England's backs, QB Drake Maye could also take advantage of Baltimore's run defense after he had 43 yards and two TDs on the ground last week. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Ravens can coverThe elite Ravens defense which has always been associated with the franchise returned last week as Baltimore pitched its first shutout in over seven years. That came versus a Bengals offense which had scored 30-plus in three straight Joe Burrow starts, while the Patriots offense has issues scoring in the redzone. It ranks 24th in redzone scoring, while the Patriots are dead last in redzone defense as just about every team which gets inside their 20-yard-line ends up with a touchdown instead of a field goal. Baltimore leads the NFL with 5.2 yards per carry, and Lamar Jackson had four passing touchdowns, plus 100-plus yards and a score on the ground, the last time he faced the Pats. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Ravens picksSportsLine's model has simulated Ravens vs. Patriots  10,000 times is going Over on the total, projecting 50 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations.

Weiss, who previously worked under Jim Harbaugh at Michigan, was indicted in March for allegedly hacking into the private accounts of students and athletes around the country to steal intimate photographs. Investigators determined Weiss accessed private student files from computers inside Michigan's football facility within Schembechler Hall, The Detroit News reported. \nThe indictment indicated that Weiss downloaded the information of more than 150,000 athletes and used it to hack into the social media, email and cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000, primarily female college athletes. His alleged crimes date back to at least 2015. At the time of his indictment, Weiss faced 24 federal charges: 14 counts of unauthorized access to computers and 10 counts of aggravated identity theft. He plead not guilty to all of them. At least a portion of the alleged crimes occurred over a 72-hour stretch within Michigan's football facility as the Wolverines prepared for their 2022 College Football Playoff game against TCU. Michigan suspended Weiss in January of 2023 when campus police launched their initial investigation, citing only \"computer crimes.\" \nPrior to his termination in early 2023, Weiss worked for the Baltimore Ravens from 2009-20 before leaving to join Harbaugh as Michigan's quarterbacks coach. He later received promotion to co-offensive coordinator and served alongside then-Michigan assistant Sherrone Moore.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots already have posted their highest win total since going 12-4 and winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title in 2019. Their return to the postseason for the first time in four years is inevitable, and they can make it official in Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season. All New England (11-3) needs to do to secure a playoff berth is defeat the Baltimore Ravens (7-7) when the teams meet at M&T Bank Stadium at 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday Night Football. A victory would be the 11th in 12 games for the Patriots, who also would clinch a spot in the postseason if the Houston Texans lose to the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday afternoon or the San Francisco 49ers beat the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night Football.Despite their early season struggles, the Ravens still are alive in the playoff picture, with their clearest path being a third straight AFC North title. Baltimore trails Pittsburgh by one game in the division race and visits the Steelers in the regular-season finale for what could be a crucial showdown.The Patriots have dominated their regular season series with the Ravens, winning nine of their 12 meetings. But Baltimore has won two of the last three matchups, including a 37-26 triumph in 2022 in which Lamar Jackson threw four touchdown passes - two to tight end Mark Andrews - while rushing for 107 yards and another score.Six games are on Sunday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the red-hot San Antonio Spurs (20-7) and league-worst Washington Wizards (5-21) at 7 p.m. ET at Capital One Arena. The Spurs enter with a five-game winning streak, while the Wizards have won two of three to increase their season total to five victories.Meanwhile, the NHL has eight games on its evening slate, one of which has the league-leading Colorado Avalanche (25-2-7) visiting the Grand Casino Arena in Saint Paul, Minn. to take on the surging Minnesota Wild (22-9-5) at 6 p.m. ET. Colorado has won four straight and is 6-0-1 since suffering just its second regulation loss of 2025-26. The Wild are seeking a season-best eighth consecutive victory a day after defeating the Edmonton Oilers to match the seven-game streak they posted from Nov. 15-28.There also is an abundance of college basketball games on Sunday, including a clash between Oregon (6-5) and No. 7 Gonzaga (11-1) at 6 p.m. ET in the Northwest Elite Showdown at the Moda Center in Portland, Ore. The Ducks have followed a five-game slide with back-to-back victories, while the Bulldogs have won four straight contests since being demolished by then-No. 7 Michigan 101-61 on Nov. 26.The Ravens are 3.5-point favorites against the Patriots in the latest consensus NFL odds. The Spurs are 15.5-point favorites versus the Wizards, the Avalanche are -160 favorites on the money line against the Wild and Gonzaga is an 11.5-point favorite versus Oregon.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Dec. 21. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchPatriots at RavensTime: 8:20 p.m. | Location: Baltimore | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Ravens -3.5 (-105) | Expert: Hunter Henry Under 19.5 longest reception (-120, PropBetGuy)The Ravens are fighting to keep their chances for a seventh playoff appearance in eight years alive as they play their final regular season game at home, where they have lost two straight and are a dismal 3-5. New England's confidence could be shaken a bit after last week's 35-31 home setback against the Buffalo Bills in which it squandered a 21-point lead. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Ravens making the holidays happy for their fans with a victory, as they cover the spread in 56% of its simulations. SportsLine NFL props expert PropBetGuy believes that even though he has had a reception of more than 20 yards in three of his last four games, New England's Hunter Henry won't have a big gain against a Baltimore defense that has allowed only one tight end to record a catch of 20 or more yards over its last eight contests.More NFL best betsRaider-Texans Over 39 (-110, Sportsline model A-rated play)Broncos -3.5 (-102, R.J.

However, these teams combined for only 213 points when they met Thursday in San Antonio, and each of the Spurs' last four games have gone Under the projected total for Sunday's matchup. The SportsLine Projection Model likes that trend to continue, as its simulations say the Under hits more than 58% of the time.NHL best bets, where to watchAvalanche at WildTime: 6 p.m. | Location: Saint Paul, Minn. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Wild +136 | Expert: Wild +1.5 (-172, Matt Severance)Both of the Avalanche's regulation losses this season came on the road, and they dropped a 3-2 decision in a shootout when they visited Minnesota on Nov. 28. Meanwhile, Minnesota is 12-0-2 in its last 14 home games and hasn't gone without a point anywhere since its 4-2 loss to the Canucks in Vancouver on Dec. 6. The Wild's first seven-game winning streak this season ended the day after they edged Colorado as they were beaten by the Buffalo Sabres 3-2 in a shootout. The SportsLine Projection Model sees them posting an eighth straight victory Sunday, making Minnesota on the money line an A-rated play. And even though the Wild faced Edmonton on Saturday, SportsLine expert Matt Severance likes them to cover the spread as rookie goaltender Jesper Wallstedt, who leads the NHL in goals-against average (1.96) and save percentage (.936), wasn't in the crease against the Oilers.CBB best bets, where to watchGonzaga vs. OregonTime: 6 p.m. | Location: Portland | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under -157.5 (-112) | Expert: Gonzaga -11 (-110, Bruce Marshall)The Bulldogs are 11th in the nation in scoring as they're averaging 92.4 points per contest. However, the total in both of their last two games away from home have gone Under the projected total for Sunday's matchup. In addition, the Ducks' last 10 contests have seen an average of 154.5 total points scored. That has the SportsLine Projection Model thinking this showdown won't be a shootout, as its simulations have the Under hitting more than 55% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall feels Gonzaga will cover the spread, as it is hitting 52.5% of its shots this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\nPatrick Mahomes taking on the Tennessee Titans and their decimated secondary could have been one of the top matchups of the year for NFL DFS players to target. Instead, Mahomes went down with a torn ACL last week as the Chiefs also saw their playoff hopes end. What level of trust can you put in his backup, Gardner Minshew, as he fills in against the Titans on Sunday afternoon? Minshew is $4,500 on FanDuel and $6,500 on DraftKings, making him a much cheaper option than other quarterbacks in the NFL DFS player pool such as Josh Allen, Dak Prescott and Joe Burrow, but not as cheap as Quinn Ewers, who will start in place of Tua Tagovailoa. Meanwhile, Geno Smith will return under center for the Raiders.Who should you target at QB, and who are the sleepers in the NFL DFS player pool that can help differentiate your lineups? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel. It simulates every game 10,000 times to help DFS players optimize and build winning DraftKings and FanDuel lineups. Optimize, export, and enter lineups confidently with injury updates, floor and ceiling player projections, and Vegas lines and picks all with one winning tool.Now, SportsLine's NFL DFS Optimizer has turned its attention to Sunday's 2025 NFL Week 15 schedule and just locked in its top daily Fantasy football lineups. You can only see its optimal lineups at SportsLine.Top NFL Week 16 DFS picks for SundayOne of the optimizer's top DFS value picks for Sunday is Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud at $5,500 on DraftKings and $7,200 on FanDuel. He faces the Raiders, who have allowed opposing quarterbacks to have the eighth-highest rating this season. Stroud is also coming off one of his most complete performances of the season, throwing for 260 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions and taking just one sack. See who else to pick here.You can also bet Stroud to go Over 227.5 total passing yards at DraftKings:\nThe optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Lions receiver Jameson Williams at $6,400 on DraftKings and $6,700 on FanDuel. Williams has a tremendous matchup against a Pittsburgh secondary that has given up the seventh-most yards to opposing receivers this season. Pittsburgh's defense won't have starting cornerback James Pierre (calf) and starting edge rusher T.J. Watt (lung) again this week. That should make life even easier on Detroit's passing game, and Williams is the value play from the unit as he comes in approximately $2,000 cheaper than Amon-Ra St. Brown on both sites. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.Bet Williams to go Over 69.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to build Sunday Week 16 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Sunday, and which under-the-radar NFL DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\nTeams in a battle to win their respective divisions meet when the New England Patriots face the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16 'Sunday Night Football' at 8:20 p.m. ET from M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. The Patriots (11-3), who lead the AFC East, hold a one-game lead over the Buffalo Bills with three games remaining. The Ravens (7-7), who are second in the AFC North, trail the Pittsburgh Steelers by one game. The matchup will feature quarterback Drake Maye and the Patriots against quarterback Lamar Jackson and the Ravens. Both players figure into several NFL player props or a Sunday Night Football SGP, in a contest in which Baltimore is favored by three points.Maye has played at an MVP-type level for a good portion of the season, completing 70.9% of his passes for 3,567 yards and 23 touchdowns. Jackson, meanwhile, has completed 63.5% of his passes for 2,210 yards and 18 touchdowns. There are several NFL player props one could target for these stars, or you may find value in seeking NFL prop lines for other options like TreVeyon Henderson, Rhamondre Stevenson and Stefon Diggs of the Patriots, and Derrick Henry, Zay Flowers and Mark Andrews of the Ravens.

Maye has thrown for one or fewer touchdowns in three of the last four games. In the 35-31 loss to the Buffalo Bills last week, he did not throw a touchdown pass, while throwing one interception. Despite throwing for nearly 300 yards in a 26-20 win at Cincinnati on Nov. 23, Maye threw for just one touchdown. He also had one touchdown in a 27-14 win over the New York Jets on Nov. 13. The SportsLine Machine Learning Model projects Maye to have 0.9 touchdown passes and gives this prop a 3.5 out of 5-star prop rating. See more NFL props here. Bet Maye to go Under 1.5 passing touchdowns at DraftKings:\nHow to make NFL player prop bets for Patriots vs. RavensIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has four NFL props that are rated 4.5 stars or better.

As for the Bolts, they're still playing inspired defense while continuing to chase Denver in the AFC West, and Justin Herbert's left wrist has had another week to heal and get him closer to 100%. This is arguably a tougher test for Dallas than others they didn't pass the past two weeks. Play Chargers.\" Back the Chargers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Over 48.5 in Cardinals vs. Falcons (-110)\"Both teams could get their top receiver back this week, though it's not like either team has been hurting for offense in recent weeks with the Falcons scoring 23+ in six of their last seven while the Cardinals are typically also an offense in the mid-20s in scoring but have had to face a few tough defenses in recent weeks, knocking them down to the 17-20 range,\" SportsLine expert R.J. White said. \"But the real reason to like the Over is the two defenses, as Arizona has allowed 40+ points in four of their last six, while Atlanta has given up 27+ in five of their last six. In an indoor environment, this should be a game that reaches the 50s.\" Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Ravens (-3) vs. Patriots (-115)Although the Patriots haven't technically clinched yet, they have all but secured a spot in the playoffs, whereas the Ravens are in essentially a must-win mode every week as they sit at 7-7 and enter the week a game behind the Steelers in the AFC North. Besides just the basic need to win this game, the Ravens have played better football as of late, and specifically, Lamar Jackson has looked more like his former MVP self in recent games. Jackson has played through injuries throughout the season, but he led the Ravens to a 24-0 win over the Bengals last week. The Baltimore defense shutting out Joe Burrow and the Bengals last week was impressive, and the Patriots are coming off a 35-31 loss to Buffalo.

    "body": "\n        The Chicago Bears are one of the hottest teams in the NFL right now. After winning a wild 22-16 overtime game against the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night, the Bears are now on the cusp of clinching their first playoff berth in five years. However, they haven't earned a postseason spot just yet. At 11-4, the Bears could clinch a spot as soon as Sunday if the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Detroit Lions in a game that kicks off at 4:25 p.m ET. That would be the ideal scenario for the Bears, because then they wouldn't have to sweat anything out over the next two weeks, and there's at least one scenario that could have them sweating a lot between now and Week 18. The NFC has been so crazy this year that the Bears have two very realistic scenarios in play over their final two games: They could either end up as the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC or they could miss the playoffs entirely. Seriously. The Bears could still miss the playoffs. First, let's start with the good news for Bears fans and take a look at the path for Chicago to win get the top seed in the NFC. Bears have to win out (at 49ers in Week 17, vs. Lions in Week 18) Seahawks lose ONE of their final two games (at Panthers in Week 17, at 49ers in Week 18)That's it. The Bears need just three things to go their way and if that happens, they'll be the No. 1 overall seed. The Bears don't have to worry about the Rams because even if Los Angeles wins its final two games to finish 13-4, Chicago would win the conference record tiebreaker over them (The Bears would also win that same tiebreaker over the Seahawks at 13-4). \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: Bears deliver gut punch to Packers, Eagles repeat as NFC East champs\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe only problem with this scenario is that if the Bears beat the 49ers in Week 17, San Francisco might not have anything to play for in Week 18 against the Seahawks. The best case scenario for the Bears would be that the 49ers need to win in Week 18 to clinch a playoff berth. Now that the good news is out of the way, let's check out the bad news. Here's how the Bears could COMPLETELY MISS THE PLAYOFFS: Bears lose their final two games (at 49ers, Lions)Lions win their final three games (Steelers, at Vikings, at Bears)Packers win their final two games (Ravens, at Vikings)If this happens, then the Bears will be out of the playoffs. The Lions and Bears would both be 11-6 in this situation, but Detroit would win the head-to-head tiebreaker to finish on top of the Bears. \nThat would be Chicago's nightmare scenario and if it happens, the 11-6 Bears would become just the third 11-win team in NFL history to miss the playoffs. The Bears can avoid this situation by winning just one of the their final two games, which would allow them to clinch the NFC North. They can also avoid the situation if the Lions lose to the Steelers on Sunday, which means everyone in Chicago will be rooting for Aaron Rodgers, probably for the first time in their life. \n            ",

He's coming stateside on a two-year contract worth $34 million, CBS Sports has confirmed.The $34 million contract is well beneath expectations for Murakami, pointing to a weak market for his services. It's significantly less than the $90 million deal the Boston Red Sox handed Masataka Yoshida three years ago that remains the richest contract given to a Japanese position player.Murakami, 26 in February, has been the top power hitter in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball the last several years, and that includes slugging 22 home runs in 56 games around elbow surgery and an oblique strain in 2025. He has averaged 42.6 home runs per 162 games with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, who made him available to MLB teams via the posting system this winter.We ranked Murakami as the seventh-best free agent available this offseason. Here's the write-up:\nMurakami launched his name into orbit back in 2022, when he homered  56 times to break Sadaharu Oh's single-season Nippon Professional  Baseball record for a Japanese-born player. Clearly he has elite  strength. Alas, the ensuing years haven't been as kind. He swings and  misses a ton, even within the zone, and his strikeout rate has cleared  28% three seasons in a row -- NPB hasn't experienced the same K-rate  creep as MLB, making that one  of the worst marks among regulars. There've long been questions about  his viability at the hot corner too, with first base appearing as his  long-term home. Murakami's power and youth (he'll turn 26 in February)  will go a long way in making a team forgive those blemishes, with a  left-handed Eugenio Suárez serving as a good outcome here.Because he is 25, Murakami was able to sign a contract of any size this offseason, similar to Yoshinobu Yamamoto two years ago. Player younger than 25 are subject to baseball's international bonus pools, severely limiting their earning potential. Roki Sasaki came to MLB through that process last offseason and signed a minor-league contract with a $6.5 million signing bonus.The White Sox owe the Swallows a posting fee for signing Murakami. Here is the posting fee structure:Contract worth less than $25 million: 20% of contract valueContract worth $25 million to $50 million: $5 million plus 17.5% of amount over $25 millionContract worth more than $50 million: $9.275 million plus 15% of amount over $50 millionThat puts Murakami's posting fee at just over $6.5 million.Here are three other things to know about the Murakami signing.1. Market limited by translation concernsAs noted above, Murakami's game had some major blemishes -- notably his strikeout rate and his lack of a true defensive position. He's expected to play first base for the White Sox, but that doesn't negate the hit-tool concerns. For perspective, consider that Murakami had struck out at least 28% of the time in three consecutive seasons. Here's how some other recent NPB hitters have been their K rates behave after transferring:\nBatterFinal season NPB K%First season MLB K%NetMunetaka Murakami28.6%TBDTBDMasataka Yoshida8.714%+5.3%Seiya Suzuki16.5%24.7%+8.2Shohei Ohtani27.3%27.8%+0.5%Shogo Akiyama15.9%18.6%+2.7%Yoshi Tsutsugo25.3%27%+1.7%Everyone but Ohtani, the ultimate outlier, gained at least 1.5 percentage points. If Murakami follows suit, he'll clear a 30% strikeout rate in 2026. Only a handful of qualified MLB batters K'd so often last season, with two of the five finishing below a league-average offensive output. Given Murakami's lack of speed and defense, his power will have to port -- and immediately -- for him to provide value.2. White Sox have risky, intriguing infieldWith Murakami now penciled in at first base, the White Sox figure to run out an infield that also includes shortstop Colson Montgomery, third baseman Miguel Vargas, and some combination of Chase Meidroth and Lenyn Sosa at second.Depending on how Murakami's bat plays in MLB, the White Sox's infield could feature multiple players capable of homering 20-plus times -- Montgomery and Sosa both cleared that mark last season, and Vargas came close. Of course, that group is also highly prone to striking out, but these White Sox should be a far cry from 2023, when they received fewer than 10 combined home runs from their primary double-play combination. 3. Other top Japanese free agents remain in playWhile Murakami is now spoken for, there are still some other intriguing NPB transfers in play. Among them: right-hander Tatsuya Imai and infielder Kazuma Okamoto.Imai, ranked by CBS Sports as the 12th-best free agent, has until Jan. 2 to sign a contract. He's considered one of the best right-handed starters on the market thanks to mid-90s fastball and unusual slider. He has battled his command in the past, however, which is something teams will need to be mindful about when they commit to him for the long haul.Okamoto, CBS Sports' No. 22 free agent, is older and less famous than Murakami. He may end up outhitting him, at least at the onset of their careers, because he doesn't have the same level of hit-tool risk. Okamoto has until Jan. 4 to make a deal.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is likely to pause later this week to observe the holiday season. That won't stop teams from getting some last-minute shopping done, however. Below, CBS Sports will be gathering all of Sunday's most notable murmurs and moves in one space for your convenience. Blue Jays part of Bregman sweepstakesFor most of the winter, free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman has been tied to the Red Sox, Cubs, and Tigers. You can add the Blue Jays, the reigning American League champions, to the mix. The Athletic reports that \"Toronto seems destined to add one of the big free-agent hitters,\" with Bregman having previously been viewed as a backup plan if the Blue Jays failed to net outfielder Kyle Tucker.\nBregman would likely slot in at third base, with the Blue Jays rotating their other infielders -- Ernie Clement to second base, Andrés Giménez to shortstop -- to cover for Bo BIchette's potential departure through free agency.CBS Sports ranked Bregman as the No. 2 free agent available in this class. White Sox sign MurakamiJapanese slugger Munetaka Murakami had until 5 p.m. ET on Monday to sign a contract with an MLB club. He didn't require so long, but he certainly took it down to the wire. Instead, he's signed a two-year pact worth $34 million with the White Sox.\nMurakami will be a true free agent once that deal elapses, meaing he'll re-enter the market as a 28-year-old -- potentially with a demonstrated track record of hitting MLB pitching.CBS Sports ranked Murakami as the No. 7 free agent available this winter. Here's what we wrote:Murakami launched his name into orbit back in 2022, when he homered 56 times to break Sadaharu Oh's single-season Nippon Professional Baseball record for a Japanese-born player. Clearly he has elite strength. Alas, the ensuing years haven't been as kind.

Murakami's power and youth (he'll turn 26 in February) will go a long way in making a team forgive those blemishes, with a left-handed Eugenio Suárez serving as a good outcome here.Murakami will provide the White Sox with a young, potential impact-caliber bat who can slot into their lineup as they continue their rebuilding efforts.White Sox open to moving RobertWith Murakami in tow, the White Sox are now shifting their attention to trading outfielder Luis Robert for pitching depth, per USA Today. The White Sox are said to be in talks with the Reds and the Mets.\nRobert, 28, is coming off a disappointing two-year run that has seen him post an 85 OPS+ and average 14 home runs, 28 stolen bases, and 1.4 WAR per season. Robert is under contract through the 2026 campaign with a club option for 2027.Mariners open to Suárez reunionThe Mariners have maintained contact with free-agent third baseman Eugenio Suárez's camp all winter as the two sides remain open to a reunion, general manager Justin Hollander said Sunday on MLB Network Radio.\nSuárez, 34, is a polarizing free agent on account of his advanced age, subpar defense, and elevated strikeout. Still, he's coming off a 49-homer season and seems unlikely to be receive a long-term deal based on those aforementioned concerns. The Mariners, should they reach a new agreement with him, would slot him back in at the hot corner.  \nThe Mariners have already retained one of last deadline's big additions, agreeing to a five-year pact with first baseman Josh Naylor to kick off the winter.Yankees retain BlackburnThe Yankees are bringing back right-hander Paul Blackburn on a one-year deal worth $2 million guaranteed, per the New York Post. \nBlackburn, 32, split last season between the Mets and the Yankees, compiling a 6.23 ERA (66 ERA+) and a 2.83 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He did make some arsenal tweaks with the Yankees, leaning more on his sinker and cutter, that could lead to better results in 2026.\n            ",

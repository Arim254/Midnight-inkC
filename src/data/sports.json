Headlined by a thrilling fight that saw Justin Gaethje defeat Paddy Pimblett to win the interim lightweight championship, UFC 324 registered as the platform's largest exclusive live event to date, delivering nearly five million streaming views and seven million households.   By officially saying goodbye to the pay-per-view model, streaming live for Paramount+ subscribers, UFC 324 reached more homes than any UFC live event in nearly a decade across linear, broadcast and streaming. The UFC 324 stream hit a concurrent peak of more than 5.9 million streams.The event was also a hit on social media, serving not only as Paramount+'s most social telecast ever, but also the No. 1 trend for six consecutive hours. UFC 324 saw a 127% increase in mentions from December's UFC 323 PPV.Every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night will stream live on Paramount+ -- no additional fees -- for the duration of the seven-year deal.\nIn Saturday night's main event, Gaethje outworked Pimblett in a five-round bout ended via unanimous decision, becoming the first two-time interim champion in UFC history. He scored multiple knockdowns as part of a performance that may be seen as among the best of the year in mixed martial arts. Gaethje is now in line to unify his interim belt with full champion Ilia Topuria, who has been sidelined while dealing with a contentious divorce.\nUFC 325 is next up on Saturday, airing live internationally from Sydney, Australia. The main card, headlined by Alexander Volkanovski's featherweight title defense against Diego Lopes, will stream live on Paramount+ beginning at 9 p.m. ET.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        For the second time in eight days, the UFC will present a numbered event on Saturday as UFC 325 touches down in Sydney, Australia, for an exciting card emanating from Qudos Bank Arena. Native son Alexander Volkanovski will make his fifth UFC appearance on Australian soil when he defends his featherweight title in the main event in a rematch against Diego Lopes. All-action lightweights Dan Hooker and Benoit Saint Denis will lock horns in a much-anticipated co-feature fight. As we draw closer to the UFC's eighth visit to Sydney in company history, let's take a closer look at the biggest storylines surrounding the event. Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 325: Fight card, date, complete guide as Alexander Volkanovski takes on Diego Lopes in Australia\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n1. How much longer can Alexander Volkanovski stay on top? At 37, the two-time featherweight champion is considered by many as the greatest 145-pound fighter in UFC history thanks to victories over Chad Mendes, Jose Aldo, Max Holloway (three times), Brian Ortega and Yair Rodriguez. And his hard-fought decision win over Lopes last August at UFC 314 awarded Volkanovski the vacant title and a bit of much-needed resurgence following consecutive knockout losses and a skid of three defeats in four fights. Granted, those defeats all came against the current top two fighters in the world (Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria) and two of those came at lightweight. But with Topuria having moved up to 155 pounds, Volkanovski remains the class of the division and sits just two title defenses away from equaling the UFC featherweight record of seven by Aldo. Few fighters have maintained their elite status in the smaller weight classes this deep into their careers and Volkanovski appears as if he still has enough left to add a few more accomplishments to his Hall-of-fame resume entering the Lopes rematch. Even though Volkanovski was dropped in Round 4 of their first fight and visibly hurt twice, he bent but never broke.Watch the first meeting between Volkanovski and Lopes on Paramount+ for as little as $8.99 per month2. Expect a more calculated and dangerous Lopes in the rematchWhen Lopes, a 31-year-old native of Brazil who fights out of Mexico, faced off with Volkanovski in their first meeting last April, it marked his first time in the UFC competing for a title and fighting the five-round championship distance. Ultimately, his inexperience showed as Lopes now admits he completely abandoned his gameplan off the start and found himself desperately searching for a knockout that wasn't to be. One will never confuse Lopes with a technical master like Volkanovski. It's his aggressiveness and fighting spirit that will likely forever be his true calling card. But a more refined and patient Lopes will almost certainly be a more dangerous one on Saturday. And one can expect Lopes to be buoyed by a strong performance in September at Noche UFC when he survived a wild duel with Jean Silva by using his grappling skills early before patiently setting Silva up for what became the finishing blow on a spinning back elbow. In between, Lopes showed his trademark chin and durability in a crazy fight. Should Lopes bring a similarly smart and calculated strategy into the rematch with Volkanovski, it isn't out of the question for him to build upon the success he had late in their first fight and pull a resounding upset to commandeer control of the division. \n3. A refocused Benoit Saint Denis is a legit threat to the lightweight titleIt may have taken two stoppage defeats in 2024 for the former French Army Special Forces soldier to seek a much-needed change after absorbing tremendous punishment against Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano, but the rejuvenated BSD appears to be a new man. Saint Denis switched gyms and now fights under the tutelage of French trainer Nicholas Ott, who also works with middleweight contender Nassourdine Imavov. And the change in both tactics and mindset have done wonders for Saint Denis without muting any of the danger that he brings to the table. Under Ott, BSD is now riding a three-fight win streak following stoppages of Kyle Prepolec, Mauricio Ruffy and Beneil Dariush. In fact, all eight of his UFC wins have come via finish, with his UFC debut loss to Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos in 2021 marking the only time in BSD's 20-fight pro career that the judges were needed. Saint Denis returns Saturday against Dan Hooker in a fight that all but guarantees action and carnage. But the sizable betting favorite BSD, who enters as the No. 8-ranked lightweight, has an opportunity with a win to move within striking distance of the title. 4. It might be win or go home for lovable heavyweight Tai TuivasaDespite still being just 32, which is young for a heavyweight, it's difficult to deny just how much Tuivasa, the hard-charging brawler known for his celebratory shoey beer chugs, could be fighting for his job on Saturday. The native of Sydney will not only snap a 17-month layoff when he faces 6-foot-8 Brazilian slugger Tallison Teixeira, \"Bam Bam\" will be looking to snap a five-fight losing skid which includes four losses by stoppage. Tuivasa has never hidden the fact that fitness and training typically take a backseat to his love of partying but it's time to take his career more seriously before it's over. Tuivasa once won five straight fights -- all by knockout -- from 2020 to 2022 to become a surprising darkhorse title contender. His quick and heavy hands, mixed with his iron will, have made for a number of memorable performances for the crowd favorite who could certainly use a big one this weekend.5. Don't sleep on a pair of lightweight bouts that round out the main cardThe co-main event of Hooker-Saint Denis isn't the only 155-pound bout worth making some time for this weekend. Of the five bouts on the main card, three of them will be contested at lightweight, with a matchup between No. 9 Rafael Fiziev and No. 14 Mauricio Ruffy having all the potential to be a sleep action fight. Fiziev, who has battled injuries in recent years, snapped a three-fight losing skid (which included two decision losses to interim champion Justin Gaethje) by outpointing Ignacio Bahamondes last June. Ruffy, meanwhile, saw his red-hot start of three dynamic wins to open his UFC run get humbled in a big way at the hands of Saint Denis in September when BSD exposed Ruffy's wrestling vulnerabilities in a submission defeat. With lightweight in the midst of major turnover, look for the combination of urgency and desperation to create nothing but fireworks. And don't miss out on the continued rise of Australian prospect Quillan Salkilld, who opens the main card against veteran countryman Jamie Mullarkey. Salkilld may not be getting the same attention as middleweight Ateba Gautier following his breakout 2025 campaign, but three big wins to start his UFC run and a stunning head-kick knockout of Nasrat Haqparast have many taking notice. The 25-year-old Salkilld is 10-1 as a pro and is a heavy favorite to hand Mullarkey his fourth loss in his last six fights.\n            ",

It's the highest that Illinois has been ranked since Nov. 17, when it landed at eighth amid a 4-0 start to the 2025-26 season. The Illini are on a nine-game winning streak, dating back to Dec. 22's victory against SEC foe Missouri, with seven of those wins coming against Big Ten opponents. None were bigger than Illinois' Jan. 24 triumph against Purdue, which plummeted to No. 12 after suffering its first two Big Ten losses of the season last week. Illinois freshman Keaton Wagler put on one of the best performances that college basketball has ever seen from a first-year player. He scored 46 points, a program record for Illinois freshman and tied for the second-most ever from an Illinois player, on 9-of-11 shooting from 3-point range, which set another Illinois record. He also scored all 14 of his team's points to open the game. Texas Tech, meanwhile, continued its ascent to No. 11 after downing Houston on Jan. 24. That was the Red Raiders' second top-15 victory since Jan. 15.

Their offensive line was among the best in football and their defensive front was headlined by a pair of game-wrecking pass rushers in Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor. One of the major questions for the Hurricanes coming into the 2026 season will be whether they can remain as dominant up front after some key departures to the NFL. Both Bain and Mesidor are headed off to the NFL, while the offensive line loses star tackle Francis Mauigoa, but if any Canes fans are looking for optimism, Bain provided it in a recent interview with CBS Miami. When asked about how he thinks the Hurricanes' defensive line will fare without his presence (and Mesidor's), Bain proclaimed that he wouldn't be surprised if that group is even better in 2026. \"I feel like they might be better than this year, because they got to see me and Akeem lead em off and show em what it's supposed to look like,\" Bain said. \"Now they got that extra chip on their shoulder from getting all the way to the dance and not finishing like we wanted to. So now they get some extra fuel, some extra drive to go in next year with the right mindset and get the job done.\" \nBain pointed to the depth of the group as one of the reasons he thinks Miami will be right back in the Playoff next year trying to win a national title, noting that the only departures are himself, Mesidor and David Blay. The challenge is, those are three of their four most productive defensive lineman -- star defensive tackle Ahmad Moten staying for 2026 was a huge coup for Mario Cristobal's group.Mesidor and Bain combined for 22 of the Hurricanes' 50 sacks as a team this year, and while they return some key players like Moten and linebacker Mohamed Toure, it'll be difficult to fill those shoes on the edge. Jason Taylor has done an unbelievable job as their defensive line coach, helping Bain and Mesidor become first round talents, and now he'll look to develop the next star pass rushers at Miami. \nWhile those of us outside Miami's facility may be a bit skeptical they can simply replace that kind of talent, Bain certainly is a believer in his now-former teammates to pick up the torch and keep Miami in the title conversation. If he's right about the defensive line being somehow better than this year's special group, the Hurricanes ought to be at the top of the ACC and back in the Playoff again. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Some Golden State Warriors fans can be funny. They go from rooting for one of the worst organizations in basketball to a full-on dynasty and still their greatest joy in life seems to be tweeting about how dumb the people in charge are. Among their many gripes ...They've botched the development of young players.They've allowed Draymond Green to get away with murder. Steve Kerr has become micro-ball obsessed. The two-timeline plan is an ongoing debacle.They all but refuse to trade any draft capital. And the chief complaint, as a result of all this, is of course that the Warriors are wasting what is left of Stephen Curry's championship equity. Rather than pushing all in for a guy who clearly remains capable of captaining an honest contender, they're seemingly content to sit back and wait for him to die on the superstar vine. \n        \n            \n                Stephen Curry's championship window with the Warriors has probably closed, one way or another\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFull disclosure: I'm a Warriors fan. Grew up on Run TMC. Fell back in love with We Believe. I have levied every one of these critiques at one point or another, often in the form of firing remotes off the wall, and in most every case, once I'm removed from the throes of competitive passion, I can admit to how stupid and spoiled I sound. Four titles is three more than any Warriors fan could've ever dreamed of. All good things end. But when people become this invested in a story, they care about the way it ends. And when it ends. The latter can be a thin needle to thread. Call it quits too late and you risk ending up like the Bucks. They should've traded Giannis a year ago. Maybe even two. But, instead, in an act of sheer desperation, they paid Damian Lillard $113 million to go back to Portland so they could give another $100 million to Myles Turner in an effort to extend a story that was clearly over. \nThe Warriors have done the opposite. They've spent the last half decade prioritizing post-Steph plans largely at the behest of Joe Lacob, the venture-capitalist owner who likes to see himself as the author of this whole thing and is desperate to prove himself capable of writing an equally successful sequel. \"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that 80% of [everything the Warriors have achieved] is [because of] Steph Curry,\" Andre Iguodala has posited. \"I know Joe doesn't like when I say it that way, but it's the truth.\"Joe doesn't like it when I say it that way. In other words, Joe wants credit. And he knows anything that happens while Curry is still on his team is going to be credited, rightfully, to Curry. It smells of the late Bulls GM Jerry Krause saying: \"Players and coaches alone don't win championships, organizations do.\" \nIt's true, good organizations matter, if only because bad organizations can screw up great players. But let's not get it twisted: the Bulls were a dynasty because they had Michael Jordan, and Krause didn't like that sentiment. He wanted to believe the Bulls, this great organization, could win after Jordan, too. They haven't come close. Lacob wants his story -- not the Warriors' story, but his story -- to end differently. And so, while Curry was busy winning another championship in 2022, Lacob had already set about casting new characters for his little \"Light Years\" script two years earlier. From Logan Murdock of The Ringer:In recent years, Lacob's grip on basketball decisions has clouded Golden State's future around Curry. In 2020, he grew enamored of James Wiseman after a predraft workout, pushing the team to draft the 6-foot-11 center instead of flipping the no. 2 pick for an established player. The following year, [Lacob] pushed his front office to draft Jonathan Kuminga over Trey Murphy III, whom many on the staff pushed for, seeing the 18-year-old as a potential star who could both help Curry in the short term and then fill the seats of Chase Center long after Curry was gone. This is the problem when rich owners get close enough to the cool kids: they think they can be one of them. Jimmy Johnson walked away from a Cowboys dynasty because Jerry Jones wanted to play GM, and now the Cowboys are the only NFC team who hasn't qualified for a single conference championship in the last 30 years. The lesson? Stay in your lane. Sign the checks. Let the basketball people make the basketball decisions. But no, Lacob thinks he's an NBA scout now. Give Curry an established player for the Wiseman pick and Murphy III over Kuminga and there's a good chance he has five titles by now with time to still catch Jordan's six. That's why fans are mad. Because unlike Giannis and the Bucks, the Curry story should not be ending yet. The Warriors had all the ammo to continue arming him with a top-shelf roster, but Lacob doesn't want to fire any of his post-Steph bullets. The only reason they traded for Jimmy Butler was because it didn't cost them any future draft picks, as the future is where Lacob plans to shine. \nThe funny thing is, Lacob thinks he's just going to find his next franchise player in the draft when, in fact, those players hardly exist in the first place, and even when they do, the Warriors have no recent history to indicate they are even capable of identifying who they are. 2021: The Warriors don't just take Kuminga over Murphy III, they take him over Franz Wagner. And then, with a chance at a re-do seven picks later, they take Moses Moody at No. 14 when Murphy III was still on the board, as were Alperen Sengun and Jalen Johnson, both of whom have become All-Stars. 2020: The Warriors can draft anyone not named Anthony Edwards. That list includes, among many others, LaMelo Ball, Tyrese Haliburton, Tyrese Maxey, Devin Vassell and Deni Avdija. But Lacob watches a Wiseman workout and thinks he's just found the next David Robinson. 2018: The Warriors draft Jacob Evans, whose NBA career lasts less than two full seasons, five picks before Jalen Brunson. Of course, everyone knows the draft is a crapshoot even when experienced basketball minds are making the calls. Which is to say, it's not so much that the Warriors whiffed on these draft picks (a lot of other teams did, too), it's that when it became apparent that they had missed they waited too long to admit their mistakes. That's because, in large part, they were Lacob's mistakes. That's almost certainly why this Kuminga saga has gone on this long. That was Lacob's baby. Him and Wiseman. To sell early on those guys would've been a hit straight to Lacob's ego, which is determined to keep a post-Steph renaissance in play. \nThat's the impetus of the two timelines when the reality is, whenever Curry is actually done, the Warriors will have max money and a premium franchise brand to go sign their next superstar or two. It's not to suggest they should do anything desperate. Even Curry has said that publicly. He believes superstars have an obligation to leave their franchise in good competitive standing rather than demand the type of cupboard cleanings that LeBron James is known for. That's commendable. But that doesn't mean Lacob doesn't have and hasn't long had, his priorities backward. Curry should be the focus. He's the reason for all this. The four championships. Your $10 billion franchise. And he remains a world-class player the likes of which you will never stumble into again in your life, even as, in 2017, Lacob reportedly had to be talked about of low-balling Curry on his next contract. From Marcus Thompson II:\nWarriors owner Joe Lacob was considering offering Curry a contract below the max, even though Curry has been one of the most underpaid players in all of sports over the last three seasons. Warriors general manager Bob Myers kept Lacob from bringing a reduced offer to the negotiating table, but it was enough of a thing that Myers reassured Curry of the franchise's commitment.Seriously. That was a real thing. Joe Lacob didn't want to offer Stephen Freaking Curry a max contract in 2017. On some level, he has always believed this to be his story. \"[Owners] really do be thinking it's them [responsible for the championships] and not us [the players]. Joe, too,\" Iguodala has said. \"They think they're going to build another [championship team] right after us…they think it's like 'oh we about to do it again'… We gotta wait six years to come be like I told you.\"Lacob might not realize the \"I told you\" moment is coming, but it is. Only because Curry is so great were the Warriors able to add that accidental 2022 championship banner to the rafters. By that point, Lacob figured it would be Wiseman and Kuminga starring in his show. Meanwhile, it's still Curry. It's always been Curry. And Lacob's desire for recognition notwithstanding, it will always be Curry until he's officially done, at which point Lacob will long for these moments he should've been more focused on maximizing. \n            ",

Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders has been added to the Pro Bowl as a replacement, as first reported by Jordan Schultz. Sanders is the first fifth-round rookie to make the Pro Bowl since Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua. The original AFC quarterbacks selected to the Pro Bowl were Josh Allen, Justin Herbert and Drake Maye. With Maye off to the Super Bowl, there is at least one spot open for a new quarterback in the NFL's all-star games. Sanders went 3-4 as the starter this season, and completed 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions in eight total games played. After being made the inactive emergency third quarterback for the first half of the season, Sanders got his first career start in Week 12 against the Las Vegas Raiders. Sanders led the Browns to a 24-10 victory, and completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He became the first Browns quarterback to win his first career start since 1995.While Sanders won his first NFL start, he registered the second-worst completion percentage since Week 11, which was his NFL debut, and threw an NFL-high 10 interceptions in the last eight weeks of the season as well. Sanders was pressured on an NFL-high 51% of his dropbacks, yet blitzed at the seventh-lowest rate (24%). \nThe son of NFL legend Deion Sanders fell to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft despite winning Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year during his final season at Colorado. Sanders was the second quarterback Cleveland selected, as the Browns drafted Dillon Gabriel out of Oregon in the third round. Questions remain about where Sanders stands with the organization, as Deshaun Watson is expected to return to the active roster in 2026 and the Browns are still in the process of selecting their new coach, but Sanders joins the elite club of rookies to make the Pro Bowl. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League is back again this week for one of the most eventful matchdays of the season as all the 36 teams involved in the league phase will be playing on Wednesday at the same time. While Arsenal and Bayern Munich have already secured the top eight, most of the other teams will be involved to determine their position in the standings and if they will be playing the playoffs next months. Meanwhile, Eintracht Frankfurt, Villarreal, Slavia Prague and Kairat Almaty are all already eliminated from the tournament. Let's take a look at our weekly power rankings:     1. Arsenal (--)They are still the best team around Europe, but the side coached by Mikel Arteta is starting to show some issues as they lost 3-2 against Manchester United over the weekend only a few days after winning at San Siro against Inter and clinching a top eight spot. There are no real concerns at the moment but they need to be more cynical from now on as they can't miss the opportunity this season to win at least the Premier League for the first time in more than 20 years. 2. Bayern Munich (--)I was not expecting to see them lose their first Bundesliga match of the season over the weekend against Augsburg. Vincent Kompany's side are still one of the best teams around Europe and, like Arsenal, there is no reasons to be worried about them yet. They are still eight points ahead of Borussia Dortmund and have already clinched the top eight in the UEFA Champions League. Next up: knockout stages.  3. PSG (--)Meanwhile, we've got the new leaders of the Ligue 1. It was just a matter of time to see them at the top of the French league standings and here we are. I was expecting to see them improving in the last weeks and it has happened. The match against Newcastle on Wednesday will determine if they will get to the knockout stages directly or through the playoffs. \n 4. Barcelona (--)Lamine Yamal's stunning goal against Real Oviedo made us realize once again why he's one of the best players around Europe and he's a big reason why I strongly believe Barcelona are one of the teams to beat this year. They are at the top of the LaLiga standings despite last week's defeat and they will need to win their last match against FC Copenhagen in the league phase to end up in the top eight. They can make it. 5. Manchester City (--)What's going on at Manchester City? After losing to Bodo/Glimt away last week in the Champions League's second last matchday of the league phase they managed to win against Wolverhampton over the weekend. The feeling is that they are facing some issues while the future of Pep Guardiola is still uncertain. 6. Real Madrid (+1)What a start from Alvaro Arbeloa! Three wins in one week against Levante, Villarreal and against AS Monaco last week in the Champions League debut for the former Real Madrid defender as the new head coach after he replaced Xabi Alonso on the bench of the Spanish giants. It's still early to understand where they can end up this season, but so far so good for them and the new manager. \n7. Inter (-1)They are still showing issues when they face the top teams. After winning the opening four games of the league phase, the Nerazzurri lost to Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal while they are now at the top of the Serie A standings. I mean, this is not enough if they want to have success in the knockouts. The away game against Borussia Dortmund could be a pivotal moment of their European season.  8. Atletico Madrid (--)Every season, they appear to be struggling and under threat, only to finish among the top teams in the competitions they enter. This campaign is no different: Diego Simeone's side currently sits third in the LaLiga standings and is pushing to avoid the European playoffs, holding 12th place with 13 points.9. Chelsea (+1)If we praised the job done by Arbeloa, we need to do the same here about Chelsea and the new coach Liam Rosenior. He was able to turn the spirit around of this team that seemed a bit lost under Enzo Maresca and the game against Napoli on Wednesday will be fundamental for their European run this season. \n10. Atalanta (-1)Everything has changed since Raffaele Palladino joined Atalanta and was able to turn things around pretty quickly at the club. Atalanta are back in the contention for a European spot in Serie A while they can also end up in the top eight of the Champions League potentially. 11. Liverpool (--)I don't get what's going on at Liverpool. Last week they won 3-0 away against Olympique Marseille, one of the best teams around Europe but then lost 3-2 to Bournemouth this weekend and failed to win the last five Premier League games (four draws, one defeat). Too much inconsistency this season. 12. Newcastle (+1)They needed to improve and they did it. Eddie Howe's side are currently in the top eight of the league phase but they will face PSG on Wednesday, a key match for their European campaign. I'm pretty confident that multiple clubs will try to appoint him in the summer as there will be big changes in multiple teams and a likely domino of coaches. \n13. Olympique Marseille (-1)I was definitely more confident to see them performing better against Liverpool last week, when they lost 3-0 to the side coached by Arne Slot. Roberto De Zerbi's side were also able to win 3-1 against Lens on Saturday, allowing PSG to become the new Ligue 1 leaders. 14. Borussia Dortmund (--)While the Bundesliga season seems already over they can focus on their European run. This week they will face Inter on Wednesday at their home stadium, a great opportunity to show the world they are still one of the best teams around Europe despite failing to win the last two matches against Manchester City and Tottenham. 15. Juventus (+1)Luciano Spalletti has done an incredible job and brought Juventus back to their level. Over the weekend, the Bianconeri won 3-0 against Napoli, performing one of their best matches of the season. The road is still a long one, but things are now looking much better. \n16. Galatasaray (+1)Now that Victor Osimhen is back in the team after AFCON they can hope to achieve much more than what they've done over the past two months. 17. Sporting CP (+3) They are currently 10th in the league phase standings and can potentially end up in the top eight and avoid the playoffs next month. What a season for Sporting CP, but sadly for them there is FC Porto doing something absolutely incredible with 17 wins and one draw in 18 matches so far. 18. Bayer Leverkusen (--)Some ups and downs for them this year but we could expect this from them after partying ways with Xabi Alonso at the end of the past season. \n19. Napoli (-4)What is going on at Napoli? Probably too many injuries, but Antonio Conte's side are seriously risking being eliminated from the league phase if they don't win against Chelsea this week. Over the weekend they lost 3-0 to Juventus and likely ended their hopes to win the Scudetto again. 20. PSV (-1)Weekly update of their great season: 17 wins, two draws, only one defeat and a 14-point gap on Feyenoord. Things are playing really well and ending up in the top 24 of the Champions League would be even better. 21. Tottenham (+2)It's difficult to put in words the season they are playing. Thomas Frank's team are in a good spot in Europe (5th place) but facing another big disappointing Premier League season. Which is the real Tottenham? Probably neither. \n22. AS Monaco (--)The 6-1 defeat against Real Madrid told us this is really not their season, but probably we knew that before. 23. Qarabag (+3)They still have a chance to qualify! It will be difficult because they face Liverpool in the last match on Wednesday but the 3-2 win against Eintracht Frankfurt gave them a last chance.  24. Benfica (-1)Will Jose Mourinho qualify or not? Big question. If they do, it means they managed to beat Real Madrid in the last game of the league phase. \n25. Athletic Club (+4)Before last week, I had lost all hope of seeing them reach the next phase, but the unexpected away win against Atalanta has given them another chance heading into the final match.    26. Club Brugge (--)They are finally doing better now, and have a two-point gap on Union SG in the league. They still have a chance to win the title and also qualify for the playoffs in the Champions League. 27. Olympiacos (+6)The 2-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen gave them the chance to qualify quiet surprisingly and facing Ajax away can be the perfect match to show it. \n    28. Copenaghen (-1)After beating Villarreal, they managed to hold Napoli to a home draw despite playing most of the match with ten men. However, the clash against Barcelona may prove too big a hurdle for them to realistically believe in qualification. The potential was always there, they just showed it too late.29. Bodo/Glimt (+5) The win against Manchester City was a surprise for many, but this is a team that could have done better this season in Europe. 30. Pafos (+1)They've got a chance to qualify for the knockouts but its a small one as many other teams do as well. 31. Union Saint-Gilloise (-3)Only one win in the last five Champions League matches won't make them a contender for the playoffs even if they aren't technically eliminated. 32. Ajax (+3)Too late. They are slowing coming back and the last two Champions League wins showed it. They can give themselves a chance with a win against Olimpiacos.33. Eintracht Frankfurt (-6)They are out and that's expected. 34. Villarreal (-4)They probably focused too much in the league and they were already eliminated.  35. Slavia Prague (-3)Three draws and no wins in seven games, that's not Champions League level.  36. Kairat (--)I was really hoping they could do more than just one draw in seven matches. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL hiring cycle is as robust as it's been in recent memory. In all, 10 openings popped up across the league this go-around, meaning over 30% of franchises were looking for new head coaches.When we look at the array of openings, they are quite different. On the one hand, teams like the Browns, Giants, Raiders, Titans and Cardinals all fired their head coaches -- some midseason -- after years that left them with some of the league's worst records and in the top 10 of the 2026 NFL Draft. Then, there are clubs like the Bills, Ravens and Steelers that moved on from their head coaches after their tenures -- which were considered successful overall -- ran stale and failed to meet expectations.Now, each of those teams will have new faces leading their organizations into what they all hope will be a brighter tomorrow. With five coaching positions filled, let's begin rolling out our grades for each hire.Teams yet to hire a head coach: Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kevin Stefanski: B+The new brain trust in Atlanta, headlined by president of football Matt Ryan and head coach Kevin Stefanski, is quite powerful.With Stefanski, he found himself in a quarterback tornado as head coach of the Browns, particularly over the last few seasons -- beginning with the arrival of Deshaun Watson and double-dipping in last year's draft with Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders.Even with that instability under center, Stefanski was still able to win two NFL Coach of the Year awards (2020 and 2023), so he comes to the Falcons with a strong reputation.\nSimilar to the Browns, however, Stefanski's tenure could be defined by how he develops the quarterback position, particularly with Michael Penix Jr. Unlike Cleveland, Stefanski will now have a plethora of weapons at his disposal to help Penix, most notably Bijan Robinson and Drake London. He also has Kirk Cousins currently in the fold as a veteran backup option. Stefanski was the offensive coordinator for the Vikings in 2019, when Cousins earned a Pro Bowl nod after posting a career-high 107.4 passer rating.From an offensive standpoint, this is a strong attempt by the Falcons brass to maximize what they have in Penix. It was also a savvy move to retain defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich as well.\n\n        \n            \n                Falcons hire Kevin Stefanski: Former Browns coach takes over in Atlanta in Matt Ryan's first major move\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jesse Minter: AWhile some may have expected Baltimore to go with an offensive-minded head coach to pair with Lamar Jackson, I believe hiring Minter is the better approach.One of the biggest obstacles in the Ravens' pursuit of a Super Bowl berth has been their defense falling short, despite having elite talent like Kyle Hamilton and Roquan Smith. Injuries played a major role, but the unit also simply didn't perform to its level.Minter should help fix that, as his Chargers defense ranked top five in the NFL in several key categories this season as defensive coordinator.\nChargers defense in 2025StatsNFL rankTotal YPG285.25thPassing YPG179.95thTD-INT ratio16-191stINT19T-3rdPasser rating75.01stOf course, Minter also has ties to the organization, having worked as a defensive assistant under John Harbaugh from 2017 to 2020. From there, he rose through the ranks largely under Jim Harbaugh — first as his defensive coordinator at Michigan and then with the Chargers.The biggest X-factor will be who Minter brings in as offensive coordinator, but he comes from a strong coaching tree and should be able to find the right conductor for Baltimore's high-octane offense.\n        \n            \n                Ravens hiring Jesse Minter: Chargers defensive coordinator set to replace coach John Harbaugh in Baltimore\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jeff Hafley: C+When Miami hired former Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan as its next general manager, the writing was on the wall that the Dolphins would keep that Green Bay pipeline flowing with the hiring of Jeff Hafley.This move leans into what made Miami feisty down the stretch, as it went 6-4 over its final 10 games thanks in part to improved defensive play. The Dolphins allowed 21.9 points per game over that span after surrendering 29.3 points per game in the seven games prior. With Hafley's bread and butter on defense, that unit should remain a strength in 2026.Under Hafley, Green Bay allowed 20.5 points per game, 5.1 yards per play and 108.5 rushing yards per game over the last two seasons -- all top-10 marks in the NFL. Hafley's group did stumble a bit down the stretch of the 2025 campaign, however.The bigger concern as Hafley ascends to head coach, despite his experience at the college level (he led Boston College from 2020 to 2023), comes on the offensive side of the ball. Miami appears poised to part ways with Tua Tagovailoa this offseason, and given the team's cap constraints, there's no clear path to a suitable replacement.With Hafley not coming from an offensive background, he may not be able to mask those deficiencies as effectively as a coach with more experience on that side of the ball. That could result in a lean 2026 for the franchise.\n        \n            \n                Tua Tagovailoa benched by Dolphins: Why numbers don't add up now to jettison Miami QB\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    John Harbaugh: AThis is a great marriage between the Giants and Harbaugh.From New York's perspective, the team needed to bring in a head coach with immediate credibility, particularly after three of its previous four hires were first-time head coaches. The Giants were searching for a Tom Coughlin-like figure who can stabilize the organization, and Harbaugh is certainly capable of that.Harbaugh is also the first head coach the Giants have hired who has previously won a Super Bowl, so he brings a winning pedigree that no recent coach has carried into the building.Giants during/post Tom Coughlin eraDuringSinceSpan2004-152016-25W-L102-9055-109-1Rank15th31stFrom Harbaugh's standpoint, this was the top job on the market when he accepted the gig (Buffalo had not opened up yet). New York already has a franchise quarterback in Jaxson Dart, intriguing skill-position weapons in Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo, and a defensive line stocked with stud pass rushers like Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence and Abdul Carter.The Giants also hold the fifth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, creating even more avenues to add blue-chip talent. It wouldn't be surprising to see a Harbaugh-led rebound in 2026.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Robert Saleh: BThere's an argument to be made that the Titans should have opted for an offensive-minded head coach to pair with rising second-year quarterback Cam Ward. After all, the franchise finished 30th in points per game (16.7) and 31st in total yards per game (259.6) during the 2025 season.That said, Saleh is worthy of a second stint as a head coach. While his offenses with the Jets never fully panned out, he did have New York's defense playing at a high level. If he's able to provide a similar boost in Tennessee, that would be a welcome development, particularly after the Titans have given up 27.6 points per game over the last two seasons (31st in the NFL over that span).Saleh was saddled with Zach Wilson to begin his tenure with the Jets, and after that pick flamed out, the team pivoted to Aaron Rodgers, who tore his Achilles just a handful of plays into his first season. That prevented Saleh from ever truly getting off the ground in New York, but he won't have that same problem in Tennessee, particularly if Ward carries over his second-half leap into Year 2.Cam WardFirst 10 gamesLast 7 gamesTeam PPG14.320.1Completion percentage58.4%62.0%Total TD-TO6-1211-2Passer rating73.890.5With his quarterback secure, Saleh will need to hire the right offensive coordinator, but the head coach is positioned to succeed. Beyond already having Ward in place, Saleh inherits a Titans team holding the No. 4 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and the most available cap space in the NFL, with a projected $100.7 million. That's an awfully strong starting point.\n        \n            \n                Robert Saleh rightfully gets a second chance with the Titans, but his OC hire will determine success\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike McCarthy: C+It seems clear that the Steelers are not going to be starting over here, having hired a 62-year-old coach to replace the departed 53-year-old Mike Tomlin. They're going to keep trying to win right now, and just do so with more of an offensive bent than what they've had over the last decade or so.And McCarthy is a perfectly cromulent head coach if you want that to be your plan as an organization. His overall coaching resume is actually quite similar to that of John Harbaugh, if you just look at their regular-season and playoff records and the fact that they each won one Super Bowl over a decade ago and have struggled to reach the same playoff heights since then. \nThe difference is that Harbaugh has shown an ability and a willingness to change with the times, and to adjust his schemes (through his coordinator hiring) to fit his personnel, rather than trying to fit square pegs into round holes. The issues that plagued McCarthy during his tenure in Dallas -- stagnant, uncreative offenses and game management, mostly -- were the same as the ones that he ran into toward the end of his time in Green Bay. There's also the question of what will happen if McCarthy doesn't have the same type of quarterback play in Pittsburgh that he did in Green Bay and Dallas with Aaron Rodgers and Dak Prescott. He didn't show the same type of ability to succeed with poor quarterback play that Tomlin showed over the last several years. All in all, this just seems like a rearranging of deck chairs type of hair, rather than the fresh start the Steelers probably needed.\n\n        \n            \n                Mike McCarthy isn't a sexy Steelers hire, but he's the right fit for a franchise stuck in neutral\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n            ",

The Patriots will be seeking their seventh Super Bowl title in their 12th trip to the big game, and Seattle is after its second victory in its fourth attempt. New England's fourth championship came at the expense of the Seahawks following the 2014 season when Malcolm Butler intercepted a Russell Wilson pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left to seal a 28-24 victory in Super Bowl 49. MVP candidate Drake Maye will lead the Patriots as they come off a 10-7 AFC Championship Game victory against the Denver Broncos in brutal winter conditions. Sam Darnold will guide the Seahawks, who won a 31-27 thriller over their division rivals, the Los Angeles Rams, in the NFC title game. Both defenses are in peak form but with the elements not expected to be a major factor, the offenses won't be taking a back seat in Super Bowl 60.Here's everything fans and bettors need to know for Super Bowl 60 between the Patriots and Seahawks, including the latest odds, model picks, injury reports and weather conditions. All odds are from DraftKings.Seahawks vs. Patriots (Feb. 8, 6:30 p.m. ET)Levi's Stadium; Santa Clara Calif.\nSpread: Seahawks -4.5Money line: Seahawks -230, Patriots +190Total: 46.5 (Over -105, Under -115)The Seahawks (16-3) are one of the best teams in the league on both sides of the ball. They also are battle tested, coming out of an NFC West that produced three of conference's final four teams in the playoffs. Seattle had to beat both of the others to get here, and the third showdown of the season with the Rams was no picnic. Darnold had one the best days of his eight-year career, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns, but  L.A. put up 479 yards and it was touch-and-go for Seattle until the end. A muffed punt by the Rams in the third quarter was a huge turning point. The Patriots have simply been winning, and when the storm blew in Sunday at Mile High, it seemed like anything could happen. But the defense held and the Patriots are back in the Super Bowl for the first time since Tom Brady and Bill Belichick led them to a sixth title after the 2018 season.Both teams have been excellent against the spread this season, with Seattle going 14-5 and covering in six of their past eight and the Patriots going 14-6. New England's three-point victory as a 3.5-point favorite snapped a five-game ATS cover streak. Both sides also have been strong to the Over, with Seattle 11-8 and New England 12-8 to the Over. However, the SportsLine Projection model has Under 46.5 hitting in 59% of its simulations. That get a \"B\" grade from the model, and so does New England on the money line, as they are winning in 39% of simulations, offering good value at those odds. Each team is covering in 50% of the model's simulations.  Bet on the Patriots to defeat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl for a strong plus-money payout at DraftKings, where new users can get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of $5 or more wins:\nSunday's game in Denver turned ugly in a hurry and New England was fortunate to get out with the victory, as the kickers missed two field goals apiece in the slushy conditions. The Patriots' 206-yard total against the Broncos can be chalked up to the weather, but the offense wasn't moving much in the sunshine before halftime either. Maye and Co. haven't been terribly impressive in the playoffs overall. The quarterback threw for 268 yards against the Chargers, but the Pats scored just 16 points, and the 28-16 victory against the Texans was helped immensely by the defense forcing turnovers. Maye has had his own issues protecting the ball, and that won't fly against the Seahawks. They are plus-4 in turnover margin in these playoffs and haven't given the ball away once in the two games. The Patriots are plus-3 and have eight takeaways, including four interceptions against Houston. New England had the second-best scoring offense in the NFL in the regular season, averaging 28.8 points, and Seattle was third at 28.4. On the other side, the Seahawks allowed the fewest points in the NFL (17.2) and the Patriots were fourth (18.8).   Darnold was a surprise addition to the injury report before Seattle's 41-6 victory against 49ers with an oblique injury, but he played in that game and showed no ill effects on Sunday against the Rams. He has four touchdown passes and no interceptions and has been sacked five times over the two playoff games. Maye has been sacked five times in each of his team's postseason games. The Seahawks also lost touchdown machine Zach Charbonnet for the season when the running back tore an ACL against the 49ers. Kenneth Walker III has 256 total yards and four TDs over the two games, and George Holani had 27 receiving yards out of the backfield Sunday. The Seattle offensive line is getting healthier, with starting left tackle Charles Cross (foot) and backup Josh Jones (knee) returning for the Seahawks' victory in the NFC Championship Game. Reserve lineman Amari Kight (knee) was still out, but the time off will give injured players a chance to heal. The Seahawks also hope linebacker Drake Thomas will be back after he went down late Sunday with a shoulder injury and didn't return. The Patriots lost linebacker Robert Spillane to an ankle injury in Sunday's game, but he said he expects to be ready for the Super Bowl. Jack Gibbens, who had 81 tackles and played in all 17 games this season, took Spillane's place Sunday.                      The rest of the playoff teams could only dream of California, where the temperatures should be milder for Super Bowl 60 than we've see throughout these playoffs. The high temperatures in the Bay area in early February are in the mid- to high-60's and the lows are around 50 degrees. The forecast calls for temperatures in the low 50's at kickoff on Feb. 8, with partly cloudy skies and a chance of some light wind.   Bet on the Under in Super Bowl 60 between the Seahawks and Patriots at DraftKings:\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n        A 14-game slate is featured in NFL Week 12, including a number of matchups with playoff implications. Among the biggest is when the AFC South-leading Indianapolis Colts led by quarterback Daniel Jones face the nine-time defending AFC West champion Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes, The Chiefs have struggled to a 5-5 mark this season, and both the Chiefs and Colts are winless ATS over their last two games.

    "body": "\n        The Week 12 NFL odds feature four games with a spread of a field goal or less, while three contests have a double-digit NFL line. Amongst the former are Steelers vs. Bears (-2.5), with Aaron Rodgers (wrist) listed as questionable, and Jaguars vs. Cardinals (+2.5), while double-digit favorites to place Week 12 NFL bets include Seattle (-12.5) versus Tennessee and Detroit (-12.5) versus the Giants. A team that isn't even over .500, however, is the biggest favorite on the Week 12 NFL schedule. Baltimore has won four straight to get back into the playoff picture, and they'll host the Jets on Sunday. The Ravens are at -13.5 to use in Week 12 NFL picks, and while double-digit favorites are 10-1 straight up this season, they are just 6-5 ATS. One of those games whose spread falls in between the aforementioned extremes is Chiefs vs. Colts, which has another .500 team in Kansas City as 3.5-point favorites over an 8-2 Colts squad coming off a bye. All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Arizona is 6-1 ATS versus AFC opponents since 2024, which is the second-best spread record for any team in non-conference matchups. Meanwhile, the Jags are just 1-4 ATS this year outside of Jacksonville, and the takeaways that fueled their early success have nearly dried up. The Jaguars averaged 3.3 takeaways over their first four games but have averaged just 0.8 turnovers forced per game over their last six. Thus, extra offensive possessions for Arizona allow it to take advantage of the Jags' 26th-ranked passing defense, as Jacoby Brissett is projected to have more yards and touchdowns than Trevor Lawrence. With that, the Cardinals cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Ravens (-13.5, 44.5) cover versus the Jets in well over 50% of simulations. New York is coming off a mini-bye, having played last Thursday, but there's no spread advantage with this rest edge. The Jets are 3-11-1 ATS over their last 15 games when they have a rest advantage over their opponent. Their Sunday opponent, Baltimore, has recently looked like the team most expected them to be all season as the Ravens have allowed just 14.8 points over their last five games. That includes a pair of games versus top-10 scoring offenses, but the team doesn't have to worry about seeing that with the Jets, who rank dead last in passing offense and 25th in scoring. Baltimore covers with points to spare, and the model also says the Over hits in over 70% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 12 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines.

    "body": "\n        Teams desperate to get in the win column meet on Sunday when the Las Vegas Raiders (1-8) face the Cleveland Browns (2-7) in NFL Week 12 action on CBS and Paramount+. Cleveland has lost three straight, but did cover as a 7.5-point underdog last week against the Ravens. Las Vegas, meanwhile, has dropped four straight overall, but has covered in two of its last three. Despite struggling this season, the Raiders are expected to stick with Geno Smith at quarterback, while the Browns plan to start rookie Shedeur Sanders for the first time with Dillon Gabriel in concussion protocol. Kickoff from Allegiant Stadium is set for 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. Las Vegas is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest Raiders vs. Browns odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 36.5.

It starts with quarterback concerns for both teams, but these sides also lack many game-breaking skill players to help them. Running back Ashton Jeanty was supposed to be just that for Las Vegas, but has averaged just 3.7 yards per carry this season. Quinshon Judkins has been a bit more effective for Cleveland, but only one player for either side -- Raiders receiver Tre Tucker (502 yards) -- has more than 500 receiving yards on the season. These teams, however, both have a game-wrecker coming off the edge. Cleveland's Myles Garrett leads the NFL with 15 sacks, while Maxx Crosby of the Raiders has six sacks and ranks third in the NFL in tackles for loss with 14. How these offensive lines contain those players could be an x-factor in who wins what is expected to be a low-scoring battle. Click here to bet Raiders vs. Browns at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Raiders vs. Browns score prediction, picksBoth teams are 4-6 against the spread, and Cleveland has been especially poor on the road with an 0-4 ATS mark.

That leaves just three teams vying for two spots in the Dec. 6 ACC Championship in Charlotte: No. 19 Virginia, Pittsburgh and SMU.The problem in the playoff discussion? Only Virginia is ranked, while red-hot Group of Five squads Tulane (9-2) and James Madison (10-1) continue climbing in the committee's eyes. Both conference frontrunners won on Saturday and control their own destinies.Virginia will clinch a spot in the ACC title game with a win over Virginia Tech. SMU can get in with a win over Cal and a Miami loss. Pittsburgh will reach Charlotte if it beats Miami and either Virginia or SMU loses.\nIn other words, the Hokies have become agents of chaos in the ACC. Even if Pittsburgh or SMU wins the league, there's no guarantee either will be ranked ahead of the Group of Five champions two weeks from now.ACC standings after Week 13TeamRecordNext weekNo. 19 Virginia9-2, 6-1Virginia Tech (Win to reach ACC final)SMU8-3, 6-1at Cal (Win to reach ACC final with Pittsburgh loss)Pittsburgh8-3, 6-1Miami (Win to reach ACC final with Virginia or SMU loss)No. 16 Georgia Tech9-1, 6-2N/ANo. 13 Miami9-2, 5-2at PittDuke 6-5, 5-2Wake ForestIf you're one of those crazies who roots for a conference in the playoff after your preferred team is excluded, here's what ACC fans need to hope happens over the next two weekends to all but guarantee entry: Virginia wins out and takes the ACC crown -- OR -- James Madison suffers an unexpected loss.Anything happening outside of those two possibilities leaves everything up to the committee, whose goal is to put the 12 \"best teams\" in the playoff and not the most deserving. And with the stipulation five of those bids are given as auto-conference champions, a potentially unranked winner of the ACC isn't going to have much of a say.\nKeep an eye on Tuesday night's rankings. Where SMU or Pittsburgh land in relation to various Group of Five options is extremely important moving forward.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Oregon Ducks moved a major step closer to another trip to the College Football Playoff on Saturday with an impressive 42-27 home win over No. 15 USC in the biggest game of the Week 13 schedule. That win improved them to 10-1 on the season and makes next week's game at Washington a \"win and in\" situation for the Ducks, whether they make the Big Ten title game or not. In his postgame press conference, Oregon coach Dan Lanning was asked what he hopes the College Football Playoff committee takes away from the Ducks' play this season, and he couldn't help but take a swipe at the SEC, where many of the top contenders were playing Sun Belt, Conference USA or FCS opponents.\"We just played a really good team and we beat them,\" Lanning said. \"A lot of times we play really good teams that become unranked all of a sudden, that's not our fault, right -- maybe it is our fault -- but all that we're worried about is playing the teams we play and doing the job we need to do and we did that job today. I think that the proof's in the pudding. We played a good team and we beat them. All we can do next week is try and do the same thing. \n\"This conference is a really good conference. It's competitive. We didn't play Chattanooga State today, like some other places. We competed. So with that being said, it's tough playing nine conference games. It's tough playing in this league, and we got to take advantage of playing a good team today and attacking that.\"First off, UT Chattanooga is the only college football program in Chattanooga (Chattanooga State does exist but doesn't have a football program) and, as Dan Mullen will tell you, they're an excellent football team. Second, I think the response from most SEC programs would be to ask what the difference is between opening your season with an FCS opponent, as Oregon did, and playing one at the end of it -- to Oregon's credit, they did face a good FCS team in Montana State.What Lanning's doing is understandable though, as so much gets made of the challenge of the SEC week-to-week, while the Big Ten doesn't get the same respect. A lot of that comes down to the fact that the bottom of the Big Ten looks considerably worse than the top of it, but there's certainly an argument to be made that the middle class of the Big Ten doesn't get the respect they deserve relative to similar programs in the SEC. \nThat's the more salient point in Lanning's answer here, but stumping for the Big Ten being better top to bottom than it's been credited for wouldn't grab headlines in the same way as the Chattanooga State swipe. Lanning is just doing his part to stump for his team to get the best possible seeding, for whatever that's worth for a team that almost assuredly won't be in the top 4, and couldn't resist a chance at a drive-by on his SEC rivals on a week where his team got to enjoy the spotlight mostly to themselves. \n            ",

With two of the best defenses in the league meeting in the final in Tulsa, chances came at a premium, but neither side were able to take them as they extended lengthy shutout streaks in the final. Tulsa keeper Tyler Deric guessed correctly on four of those Pittsburgh penalties, but was unable to save any of them, showing how fine margins can be in a game of this magnitude.Coaching only his seventh game for Pittsburgh after manager Bob Lilley was placed on administrative leave, interim manager Rob Vincent has hit cult level status in Pittsburgh by going undefeated in those matches. At 35, Vincent has also become the youngest coach ever to win the championship. Juan Guerra, who won with Phoenix Rising in 2023 at 36 years, eight months, and 37 days old, was the previous holder of the record that has now fallen.Lilley led the Riverhounds to a playoff spot in every season since he was hired in 2017, but he had never won a playoff game with the club, which rallied together under Vincent and were able to make something special happen.Pittsburgh's defense only allowed five of Tulsa's 17 shots to be on target during the match, and despite Pittsburgh only putting one shot on target, they did just enough. Even when it came to penalties, keeper Eric Dick was ready for anything that came his way as the Riverhounds won three penalty shootouts en route to winning the USL title.\nTulsa may be disappointed to not win in front of their home fans, but this is a club moving in the right direction. They were 10th in the Western Conference last season, and head coach Luke Spencer was able to lead the Scissortails within a shootout of the first league title in club history. They'll be back on this stage in what is a final of teams on the rise.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LSU is preparing one of the richest contracts in college football history in an attempt to lure Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin to Baton Rouge, a person familiar with the discussions tells CBS Sports.The deal is believed to be for seven years and worth as much as $98 million, the source said, and includes a significant promise that would make LSU competitive in revenue sharing and NIL, the source said. A formal offer has not yet been made. Kiffin is expected to make a decision on his future after next Friday's Egg Bowl against rival Mississippi State, Ole Miss athletics director Keith Carter said Friday.A seven-year deal averaging $14 million per year would make Kiffin the highest-paid coach in college football. Georgia's Kirby Smart entered the 2025 season with an annual salary of $13.3 million. Brian Kelly, the former LSU coach, was fired during the fourth year of a 10-year, $95 million contract. State laws in Louisiana complicate high-paying contracts for university employees, so LSU's contract is expected to include \"easy-to-achieve\" incentive bonuses, a source said. LSU's base salary will probably be capped at just north of $3 million with additional money coming from outside sources and incentives. Additional bonuses could push the lifetime value of the current offer above the $98 million threshold. \nKiffin's current $9 million salary at Ole Miss was tied for No. 6 in the SEC in 2025. Kiffin is the hottest candidate on the coaching carousel this year, garnering attention from two blue-blood suitors in the SEC: Florida and LSU. It's believed LSU has the momentum to land the Rebels head coach, CBS Sports' John Talty and Matt Zenitz reported Friday.  Yahoo! Sports reported Friday that LSU is promising NIL and revenue sharing investments exceeding $25 million.\n        \n            \n                Where will Lane Kiffin land post-Egg Bowl?

Kiffin has led the program to three straight 10-win seasons for the first time ever. Kiffin and his athletics director met Friday to discuss his future. Ole Miss began contract discussions with Kiffin earlier this month. The program is expected to make him one of the highest-paid coaches in the country should he choose to remain at Ole Miss. Sources described the negotiations in late October as \"positive,\" though no resolution has been reached in the weeks since.\nKiffin deflected questions about his future during a teleconference with reporters Wednesday, just days after a plane carrying his family members traveled to Gainesville and Baton Rouge on consecutive days, sources told CBS Sports. Kiffin's ex-wife, Layla Kiffin, was among those on the flights.\"I'm saying the same thing for six years,\" Kiffin said on an SEC teleconference. \"I'm not talking about speaking on other jobs. I'm focused on this one.\"Ole Miss travels to Mississippi State on Nov. 28.\"Despite the outside noise, Coach Kiffin is focused on preparing our team for the Egg Bowl, and together, we want to ensure that our players and coaches can concentrate fully on next Friday's game,\" Carter said in a statement Friday. \"The team is on the cusp of an unprecedented season, and it's imperative they feel the support of the Ole Miss family in the week ahead.\" \nKiffin is 54-19 in nearly six full seasons, which includes four 10-win seasons, while leading the Rebels.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two UAB football players suffered stab wounds in an incident that occurred at the school's football facility on Saturday morning, according to AL.com. The suspect, another UAB player, is in custody, the school said in a statement. The two injured players are in stable condition after being transported to UAB Hospital with non-life-threatening wounds. An investigation into the incident is underway.The school has not identified any of the players involved, but Jefferson County (Ala.) jail records show that Daniel Mincey, a redshirt freshman offensive lineman from Pompano Beach, Florida, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and attempted murder. Mincey, who spent his freshman season at Kentucky before transferring to UAB, was booked at 12:40 p.m. Saturday and remains in custody. \"We're grateful to report that two players injured in an incident this morning at the Football Operations Building are in stable condition. Our thoughts are with them and their families as they recover. The suspect -- another player -- remains in custody and an investigation is taking place,\" the school statement reads, via ESPN.  The incident occurred hours before the Blazers were scheduled to play South Florida at 3 p.m. ET at Protective Stadium in Birmingham. The team elected to proceed with the game as scheduled, the school said. \n\"The team elected to play today's game. UAB's top priority remains the safety and well-being of all of our students. Given patient privacy and the ongoing investigation, we have no further comment at this time,\" the statement says.After the game, a 48-18 loss for the Blazers, interim coach Alex Mortensen addressed the incident and how his team responded throughout the day. While the team overall chose to play, Mortensen noted that several players opted to sit out, a decision that he and his staff respected.In his opening statement, Mortensen expressed gratitude that both injured players were in stable condition.\n\"More than anything, I'm just grateful that those two players are in stable condition, and we will make sure that they have the support that they need,\" Mortensen said. \"I hope you will join me in lifting them and their families in your thoughts and prayers, as our team is doing. I also ask that you respect their privacy as they deal with what happened.\"Mortensen added that the school will provide \"support and resources\" for all players affected by the incident. Asked why the team chose to play the game in light of the morning's events, Mortensen said the players wanted to make sure the seniors got to play one more home game.\"We spoke as a team, and we spoke with the team,\" Mortensen said. \"Those guys really wanted to play today. The conversation really came back to the seniors. With it being senior day, they really wanted to play for them and give them an opportunity to go out and compete and play. That was really the biggest thing.\"\nDespite the result on the field, Mortensen said he was proud of how his team came together and supported one another. He understands there will be frustration after a lopsided loss, but Mortensen wanted to credit his team for fighting through terrible circumstances.\"I think the thing that was evident to me was these guys love each other,\" Mortensen said. \"This team is close. They really care for each other. I would say this too. I'm not one to lecture fans or any of that. This is a profession that's about competing and winning. I know there are going to be people who are frustrated.\"But I do hope that, the guys who went out there and fought today, they respect what they did and understand what they went through today and how hard they fought. And how much they care about each other and representing this university and this program well. I think they went out there and did it with class today. I really did.\"\nUAB still has one more game remaining on its schedule, a road game at Tulsa next weekend, and Mortensen said his team will be ready.\"We're gonna go compete,\" Mortensen said. \"That's the way I'm wired. That's the way I've always been wired. We're gonna get to work, and I think the guys will too.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In what amounted to a College Football Playoff elimination game between two top-15 titans in the Big Ten, No. 7 Oregon kept its conference championship and national title hopes alive Saturday with a spirited 42-27 win over No. 15 USC.The Ducks (9-2) need a win at Washington and a Michigan victory over Ohio State next week to reach the Big Ten Championship Game for the second straight season as the league's reigning champion.The loss for the Trojans (8-3) eliminates the Trojans team from various league title scenarios and now, the race will be decided during rivalry weekend with unbeatens Ohio State and Indiana leading the way ahead of Oregon and Michigan, a 45-20 winner at Maryland.Oregon never trailed following Malik Benson's 85-yard punt return midway through the second quarter and put it away with Noah Whittington's touchdown run with 5:30 to play after USC had cut a two-score deficit to eight points on Jayden Maiva's to Lake McRee in the final frame.\nBefore getting to what Oregon's victory means in the overall playoff picture, here's a glance at how updated Big Ten Championship scenarios coming out of Week 12:Big Ten tiebreakers, explained The tied teams will be compared based on head-to-head matchups during the regular season.The tied teams will be compared based on record against all common conference opponents.The tied teams will be compared based on record against common opponents with the best conference record and proceeding through the common conference opponents based on their order of finish within the conference standings. The tied teams will be compared based on the best cumulative conference winning percentage of all conference opponents.The representative will be chosen based on the highest ranking by SportSource Analytics (team Rating Score metric) following the regular season.The representative will be chosen by random draw among the tied teams conducted by the commissioner or designee.Big Ten Championship scenarios after Oregon's winIf Oregon beats Washington next weekend and Michigan beats Ohio State, the Ducks are in the title game.If Michigan beats Ohio State and Washington beats Oregon, the Wolverines are in the title game.If Ohio State beats Michigan, the Buckeyes are in the title game.If Indiana beats Purdue, the Hoosiers are in the title game.Michigan has won four straight over the Buckeyes, but an upset of top-ranked Ohio State next week would be the most improbable victory in the current stretch of success.For the Ducks to secure an opening-round home game, they're going to need to beat Washington on the road during rivalry weekend. A loss for Oregon and a 10-2 finish would put them team in a logjam with several other at-large, 10-win teams and would risk the Ducks falling behind two-loss Oklahoma and Notre Dame given the hot streak's each has shown in the final month.\nOklahoma took out No. 22 Missouri on Saturday for its third straight quality victory, while the Fighting Irish walloped Syracuse, 70-7, and have Stanford left.In CBS Sports' latest playoff bracket projection, Oregon was slotted as the 8-seed hosting No. 9 Oklahoma in December. However, should Oregon, Oklahoma and Notre Dame win out, we're expecting the Ducks to move to No. 6 in the final bracket replacing Ole Miss, which could slide should Lane Kiffin bolt to LSU.Committee chair Hunter Yurachek explained after the third playoff rankings why the Ducks were one spot ahead of the Sooners.\n\"Oregon, while their strength of schedule metric may not be as strong as an Oklahoma, we felt like they are a very strong team on both sides of the ball,\" Yurachek said. \"Offensively and defensively, they rank in the top 10 of most of the statistical categories that we use, in comparison to other teams.\"Yurachek noted Oregon's recent ranked win at Iowa and said the committee still views the victory at Penn State in September as a quality win.\"I know Penn State is not the same Penn State we expected them to be this year,\" Yurachek said. \"Still, it's a very challenging place to play as evidenced by Indiana having to have a last-second touchdown to win there a couple weeks ago. So there was significant discussion about that, but Oregon at 9-1 stayed one spot ahead of Oklahoma.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the National Women's Soccer League prepares for its biggest game of the year, the NWSL Championship (8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+), it finds itself in the midst of another high-stakes moment -- whether its biggest star can be retained. Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman is navigating a pivotal moment in her young career. Her 2025 season has been a balancing act of persistent back injury, with an epic comeback, only for a new injury to hamper her playoff status. She's managed all the highs and lows while operating under the unknown of where she could play next, and now, whether or not this is her last game with the Spirit.\"No, I'm not there at all. And genuinely speaking, like I've made no decisions,\" Rodman told the media on if she's thought about this being her last Spirit game.\"Yeah, there could be conversations being had, but right now, like, I am so excited to be representing the Spirit. I'm not even thinking of when my last game will be. But, yeah, I just want to win it [the championship], and we'll see.\"\nShe's currently on the last year of her contract, a record-setting deal she signed out of her rookie year that was the first-ever million-dollar deal in NWSL at the time. There's been plenty of reporting around the increased interest she's receiving both overseas and even through other competing leagues within the United States.Along with interest from teams in England, DC Power of the USL Super League is interested and has a contract \"significantly larger\" than anything the NWSL can currently offer, according to The Athletic. The league is another division one women's league operating in the U.S., currently in its second year of operation, and operates without a salary cap. On Thursday, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said in response to offers from competitors that the league \"will fight\" to keep Rodman in the league, and the player was moved by the sentiment but was trying to retain her focus on the championship final. \n\"I'm honored to have her say that ... Really happy about that, but at the same time, like, I don't want to put that pressure on myself, of like, because she said that now I'm like, 'Oh shoot. Like, I'm trapped.' But at the same time, I'm focused on this weekend, and that's really all I can focus on, and then moving forward, that's when I really have those conversations and tough calls that I need to have,\" Rodman said. The salary cap has rapidly become a point of contention in a year where multiple players have opted to go play overseas. U.S. national team defender Naomi Girma kicked off the transfer flow of players in January, while winger Alyssa Thompson followed during the summer. Defender Emily Fox has played with Arsenal since 2024, and midfielder Catarina Macario turned pro out of Stanford and began her career in France and is now with Chelsea.The league is bullish on the salary cap as its main mechanism to keep its world-renowned parity. That, to keep a league competitive, means there's talent across clubs, and not just one or two teams. \n\"I'm not, like, a vet in the league, like, there's only so much I can say,\" Rodman shared about retaining talent across the league. \"It's grown so much year to year, so I'm grateful for that. And even a position that I'm in, and the pay that I'm getting already is more than a lot of players, so there's only so much I can speak to, and those are conversations my agents are having. So for me, my focus is on the field. There's only so much I can speak on. Obviously, players want to get paid as much money as they possibly can. So, if that can grow, that'd be amazing. But at the same time, the league is slowly but surely growing every single year.\"Whether or not the salary cap is an appropriate mechanism for the league, its clubs, and players to navigate retention and talent, for Rodman, it's a complex balance with the league she's been with since she was 18 years old.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS   | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190\"I mean, I think it's hard to say. In women's sports, there's always this fight for equal pay to get paid more for the work that we do. But again, like, I'm 23 years old, I'm not going to try to completely change the league and fix that, but at the same time, yeah, we're always going to push and strive for more,\" she said. \nIn the weeks leading up to the end of the season, Rodman has been trying to work her way back from an MCL sprain and be a presence for her team in her limited minutes. She featured off the bench for the Spirit in the semifinal and was a threat on goal even in a brief time on the field. As she looks ahead to the final, she's just trying to find ways to shut out the noise about her contract status and focus on herself and her teammates.\"I think prioritizing just a little bit of alone time, because I think it's important, if that's just listening to music, reading a book, or, I don't know, just hanging out, taking a nap, just having that time for yourself, I think is important,\" Rodman told CBS Sports about managing the chaos around her. \"Being on a team sport, you're always around them, as much as you love them. Sometimes it's like, 'Okay, I need to breathe. I need to just live in the moment and be present.' So that's important. And then also, managing time with family, boyfriend, whatever, and then also coming back. Being able to have Ben [Shelton] here this week has been amazing for me.\"\nRodman leaning on her pro tennis boyfriend isn't new; the two have split time supporting each other at their respective sporting events. Sharing the spotlight has been helpful, especially with decisions looming on the horizon. \"He's just telling me that I'm the driver in this situation, and in life, and that I control whatever I want, and yeah, God is great,\" she said.The Washington Spirit will face Gotham FC on Saturday for the 2025 NWSL Championship. Rodman last won the championship with the Spirit in 2021 during her rookie season. All eyes will be on her whether she starts or features off the bench, as it could be her final game in the NWSL if she decides to leave.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN JOSE -- The quest for the 2025 NWSL Championship enters its final day, the Washington Spirit face a pivotal question: Will soon-to-be free agent Trinity Rodman be fit to play?Spirit head coach Adrian Gonzalez offered the update fans have been waiting for: Rodman is \"going to be available and ready to compete.\"\"Trin is doing good. She's been, I think, improving so quick, pushing to be able to play,\" Gonzalez said. \"Fortunately, we could see her last week, playing some minutes, and she's doing great, so obviously she's going to be available and ready to compete.\"Rodman's season has been marred by injuries. A lingering back injury sidelined her for nearly four months and even sent her to Europe for treatment. Just 16 games after she returned, an MCL sprain kept her sidelined during the playoff push. She was bench-listed for both playoff games, making only a brief cameo in the final minute of Washington's semifinal win over Portland -- her first action in a month. Now, with the Spirit on the brink of a second NWSL Championship title in four years, her game-day availability could be the difference between glory and heartbreak.\nYou can catch the game Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.Rodman has dominated championship-week headlines -- not just because of her return from injury, but for what comes next. The 23-year-old enters the final game of the season as a potential free agent this offseason, with a report looming regarding a lucrative offer from USL Super League side D.C. Power, according to The Athletic. Her future has become a talking point across the league, has prompted commissioner Jessica Berman to emphasize that she and the league \"want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her.\" That backdrop adds even more intrigue to her availability for Saturday's must-watch title clash.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Rodman's return to the pitch this season has been anything but smooth, but the fact that Gonzalez declared her \"available and ready to compete\" is a significant upgrade, considering she was labeled as questionable entering the semifinal against Portland, where she subbed in as a late-game option and played a minute. \nWhile that's not a ringing endorsement of the ability to play lengthy minutes, it took Rodman one minute and four touches to record a definitive shot on goal. It shows again why she's such an important player, no matter the amount of time she can give to the Spirit in a high-stakes game like the NWSL Championship. Her availability isn't just a boost; it could be a potential game-changer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A trip to the College Football Playoff is off the table for No. 20 Tennessee, but the Volunteers have plenty to play for as they enter a two-game closing stretch against rivalry opponents that begins Saturday at Florida. The Volunteers will be seeking their first road win over the Gators since 2003 as they travel to take on a struggling UF team with no path to a bowl.While a postseason bid is not available to the Gators (3-7), facing the Volunteers marks the first of two straight home rivalry showdowns to end the season. Taking on Tennessee this week and Florida State next week gives UF a chance to close a frustrating campaign with purpose.Bet Tennessee vs. Florida at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:Playing Tennessee offers a shot at revenge for Florida after it suffered a crushing overtime loss to the Volunteers last season. Tennessee's 23-17 win over the Gators in 2024 snapped a five-game losing streak in the series and set the Vols on a path to the College Football Playoff.\nThere isn't a viable path back to the CFP for Tennessee at this point. But closing the regular season with a pair of victories would get the Vols to 9-3 and give them a chance to secure a 10th victory in a bowl game. If that 3-0 finish comes to fruition, it would mark the program's third season of double-digit victories in four years under fifth-year coach Josh Heupel.Where to watch Florida vs. Tennessee liveDate: Saturday, November 22 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Ben Hill Griffin Stadium -- Gainesville, FloridaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)Florida vs. Tennessee: Need to know  Turnover troubles: This is a matchup of two of the SEC's most mistake-prone quarterbacks. Florida's DJ Lagway has thrown 13 interceptions, which is second-most nationally. Tennessee's Joey Aguilar is tied for fourth with 10 interceptions, including four in his last two games. The Gators are tied for 88th nationally with a minus-2 turnover margin. While Tennessee is plus-3 for the season in turnover margin, it gave up game-changing defensive touchdowns in losses to both Alabama and Oklahoma.\nSeries changing: These former SEC East rivals have met annually every year since 1990, but that's about to change. With the SEC's new scheduling format taking hold next season, the Volunteers and Gators will no longer be annual foes. Tennessee will play Alabama, Kentucky and Vanderbilt as permanent rivals over the next four years while Florida will play Georgia, South Carolina and Kentucky. The teams will renew their series in 2027 at Tennessee, but the Volunteers won't make another trip to Florida until 2029.Ongoing coaching search: While closing with rivalry opponents like Tennessee and Florida State gives Gators fans a reasons to stay engaged with the on-field product, the focus for most who follow Florida has been on the future for several weeks now. Even before coach Billy Napier was fired amid a 3-4 start, the writing was on the wall to suggest a regime change was likely coming. Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin is at the top of Florida's wishlist in its pursuit of a new coach, but Tulane's Jon Sumrall is also in the mix. Both are also in the running for other jobs, though, which means the Gators search could get interesting in the days ahead.Florida vs. Tennessee prediction, picks  \nFlorida's will to defend the run appears to be fading as the Gators plunge deeper into what's become a hopeless season. At 3-7, Florida has officially been disqualified from contention for a bowl game and now must deal with a Tennessee offense that still has explosive potential. Crippling turnovers have been an Achilles heel for the Volunteers this season, but the Gators have actually been worse in that department. This is the time for Tennessee to end its 10-game losing streak in The Swamp. Pick: Tennessee -4\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

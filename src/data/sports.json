The Jayhawks since then have reeled off six consecutive wins -- three vs. top-13 opponents -- and are up to No. 6 in this week's Power Rankings. They are finding their groove with March approaching, and Darryn Peterson's ability -- and availability! -- is a huge part of that.Florida's recent surge is also instrumental to this week's big shakeup, as the Gators beat Alabama 100-77 on Sunday to emphatically state their case as the SEC's best. They are now tied for first in the SEC standings and have won 11 of their last 13 games. What once seemed improbable -- Florida being a top-10 team after a 5-4 start -- is now a reality.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: St. John's, UConn set for Big East showdown on Friday in Madison Square Garden\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt the top, though, there is little change -- and that of course starts with Arizona. The Big 12's best remains No. 1 with a bullet thanks to a perfect 22-0 record. They are the best of the sport, and also the best of the best by league this week. Of the 20 ranked teams, the Big 12 has five, which is more than the Big Ten, SEC, ACC and Big East.Here they are broken down by conference:\nBig 12: 5Big Ten: 4SEC: 4ACC: 3Big East: 2There's plenty of other surprises in this week's rankings -- Illinois is way up, Nebraska is way down, for example -- but I don't want to provide any more spoilers. Let's get to the rankings.College Basketball Power Rankings1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    Arizona remains the undisputed No. 1 team in the Power Rankings because it remains the only major conference team in college basketball yet to take a loss. The 22-0 Wildcats are off to their best start to a season in program history and are a near-lock to be a  No. 1 seed next month.

This team has a strong case to be considered in the elite tier alongside Arizona. It is 21-1 and No. 1 in college basketball in scoring margin. Previous: 63\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    Illinois is the biggest riser in the rankings the last month and it is up to No. 3 after its home win over Northwestern on Wednesday to extend its winning streak to 12 games. The Illini are scorching the sport with the No. 1 offense in adjusted efficiency at KenPom and are T1 in the Big Ten standings with Michigan. Previous: 74\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    The Big East is down a smidge this year but that is no fault of UConn, and therefore I refuse to punish the Huskies. They have won 18-straight and are 22-1 on the season. That's a better start to the season than either of Dan Hurley's title teams had. Previous: 45\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Duke is on a 10-game winning streak -- all vs. ACC opponents. The Blue Devils are unbeaten in conference play with UNC on deck Saturday in Chapel Hill. Previous: 56\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    I nearly wrote off this Kansas team a month ago after it slipped to 11-5 overall and 1-2 in Big 12 play. Since then: KU has won six-straight, three of which were vs. top-13 teams. They've turned a corner, and not coincidentally, that has coincided with Darryn Peterson's best stretch of play all season. Previous: NR7\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    Vandy's shaken off its three-game mid-January lull with three consecutive wins to get back into the top-10 of the Power Rankings. This Commodores team continues to show its resilience and experience. They are likely to be favored in all but one of their remaining regular season games according to KenPom. Previous: 168\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    Fourteen wins in its last 15 outings has Houston comfortably remaining inside the top-10. This team's toughest tests may be upcoming, though, with trips to BYU, Iowa State and Kansas -- as well as Arizona at home -- upcoming in the next three weeks. Previous: 89\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    An 87-80 road loss to Portland for Gonzaga, which was favored by 21.5 points, is brutal. No two ways about it. Still: Gonzaga's been unlucky with injuries of late, and it is 22-2 overall despite that slip-up. Previous: 1010\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    Not sure I believed Florida would at any point be in the Power Rankings -- much less in the top 10 -- but here we are. We all saw with our eyes how they dismantled Alabama 100-77 last Sunday. That was the culmination of a great last month in which they went 7-1. They are currently T1 in the SEC standings. Previous: NR11\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    The St. John's team we've seen the last month isn't quite the same St. John's team we expected to get as a preseason No. 5 team. But it's sure close. Rick Pitino's Johnnies are winners of eight-straight heading into Friday night's game vs. UConn. Previous: NR12\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miami (Ohio)\n                    \n    \n    Miami is the only other team aside from Arizona to remain perfect on the season. The 23-0 Redhawks have two OT wins and two two-point wins in their last five outings, but they continue to find ways to close out games. Previous: 313\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    ISU is second in college basketball in scoring margin with top-10 units on both offense and defense at KenPom in adjusted efficiency metrics.

Whether or not the Aggies can sustain this start is one thing -- admittedly, I am dubious -- but they are 17-5 and outperforming expectations by a wide margin in the SEC under first-year coach Bucky McMillan. Previous: NR15\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            N.

    "body": "\nPro Football Hall of Famer Christian \"Sonny\" Jurgensen III died Friday at the age of 91. Jurgensen's family released a statement through the Washington Commanders announcing Jurgensen's death and asking fans to celebrate his life and legacy this weekend. It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of our husband, father, and grandfather, Sonny Jurgensen. We are enormously proud of his amazing life and accomplishments on the field, marked not only by a golden arm, but also a fearless spirit and intellect that earned him a place among the legends in Canton. But to those of us who knew him beyond the stadium lights, he was the steady, humorous, and deeply loving heart of our family. He lived with deep appreciation for the teammates, colleageus, and friends he met along the way. While he has taken his final snap, his legacy will remain an indelible part of the city he loved and the family he built. We are comforted by the knowledge that he brought joy to so many. This weekend as we enjoy the game that he loved so much, join us and rais a glass, share a story and a smile, as we celebrate the extraordinary life of a man who was, to us, the greatest of all time.Jurgensen played for 18 years in the NFL, spending seven seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, including being part of the 1960 championship team, and 11 years with the Washington Redskins. He was a five-time Pro Bowler and was voted an All-Pro three times, including a first-team selection in 1961 with the Eagles. Jurgensen led the NFL in passing five times in his career, and is still second on Washington's all-time passing yards list, only trailing fellow Hall of Famer Joe Theismann. He's also second in Washington franchise history in passing touchdowns with 179, trailing another Hall of Famer in Sammy Baugh. Jurgensen was elected into the Hall of Fame in 1983 after compiling 32,224 yards, 255 touchdowns and 189 interceptions in his playing career. He was named to the Hall of Fame's All-1960s team, alongside Johnny Unitas and Bart Starr. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline has come and gone, and while it may not have given us the sheer shock value that the Luka Dončić deal did, plenty of big names ultimately found new homes. Five recent All-Stars in Darius Garland, James Harden, Jaren Jackson Jr., Anthony Davis and Trae Young all moved, and a number of big-name role players went with along with them.With the exception of Harden, all four of those recent All-Stars had previously spent at least most of this season, if not the last several seasons, mired in trade rumors. While Dončić-esque shocks do occasionally happen, the NBA is usually pretty good at making it clear who we should expect to move in the near future. When a player is unhappy, reporters tend to suss that out. When a team is falling apart, it's usually clear in how they play. If a team is facing some salary cap-induced decision, it's visible from a mile away.So we just moved beyond one transaction cycle, and a number of big names are suddenly off of the table. Who's waiting for us in the next big transaction cycle, the 2026 offseason? Let's try to figure that out. The summer do-oversBucks fans are doing a victory lap right now. Giannis Antetokounmpo is posting Wolf of Wall Street memes as the Bucks kept their best player beyond the deadline, but that does not mean he's committed to staying in Milwaukee for the rest of his career. I've covered everything that changes about the Antetokounmpo sweepstakes over the summer here, but this is the short version:\nThe Bucks will likely wind up with a lottery pick of some sort variety this offseason. It will be the lesser of their own pick and New Orleans'. In a perfect world, they won't suit Antetokounmpo up again this year in order to lose as many games as possible. If he's healthy and wants to return, however, there's little the Bucks can do to stop him. But one way or another, you'd expect the Bucks to land somewhere in the lottery. It might be in one of those last few Play-In spots. It might be in the 8-10 range. Or maybe they get lucky and jump into the top five. They just can't pick at No. 1.The Bucks will then use that lottery pick along with their selections in 2031 and 2033 to try to improve the team and convince Antetokounmpo to stay. He is eligible for a contract extension in October. Discussions will be held earlier to take his temperature. If he makes it clear he will not extend, that's tantamount to a trade request. They can't risk him walking for nothing in free agency.If trade talks resume, a number of existing suitors will reenter the fray with more draft picks and financial flexibility to offer, and new teams could enter based on how the postseason plays out.Got all that? Good. Antetokounmpo's shadow lingered over the 2025 offseason. Legitimate talks dominated the 2026 deadline. And now, his future is the single most important story of the 2026 offseason.Not quite as important? Ja Morant. The Grizzlies traded two-thirds of their preexisting core in Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane, and they got seven first-round picks for doing so. The impetus to get significant value for Morant therefore lowered. Memphis couldn't find a deal at the deadline, but it's not hard to imagine someone with loftier ambitions in the offseason settling for Morant as a backup plan. It's easier to talk yourself into him fitting onto a new team with a full training camp ahead and offseason to build around him. Memphis won't get much for him, but he's probably movable, if only for matching salary.Michael Porter Jr. falls somewhere between the two in terms of both value and eagerness for a move. The Nets have a history of dangling players at deadlines, refusing to move them during the season for anything less than peak value, and then actually getting that value over the summer. It happened for Mikal Bridges. It happened for Cam Johnson. We may be watching it play out now with Porter Jr. He's having an All-Star-caliber season in Brooklyn, and it's possible that someone who struggles to score in the playoffs comes to the Nets with a real offer over the summer after no one did so in recent weeks. Keep in mind, though, that the Nets have no incentive to tank next season as the Rockets control their first-round pick. They likely wouldn't mind winning next season, so they won't trade Porter unless it's a strong offer.\nThe 'how serious are you about Giannis?' crowdSo, for now, we can assume teams will resume their pursuits of Antetokounmpo in June. That immediately puts quite a few big names on the table. Every Knick except Jalen Brunson. Every Timberwolf except Anthony Edwards. Every Warrior except for Stephen Curry. Every... Heat?... Heatle?...Miami Man?... except for Bam Adebayo. All of them were on the table at the deadline. The Bucks will have similar access to them in the offseason.That was obvious. The bigger questions relate to the players that, so far as we know, were not on the table this week. We know Cleveland made a call about Giannis at some point. If they were ready to offer Evan Mobley then, a deal likely would have happened. Would a disappointing playoff run change their mind? Potentially. Remember, Donovan Mitchell is set for free agency in 2027. If he isn't satisfied with the state of the roster, changes are going to be made in order to keep him. Whether he'd want to trade Mobley for Antetokounmpo remains to be seen, but if Cleveland misses the conference finals again, you'd imagine the Cavaliers would at least consider it.How about Paolo Banchero? He functionally couldn't be dealt to Milwaukee at this year's deadline because of his poison pill contract. Next season, his rookie extension kicks in, and the Magic can far more easily swap him and a bit more salary for Giannis. Would they do so? He doesn't exactly solve their shooting issues, but they just spent four picks on Bane. The Magic want to win now, and if they have doubts about the Banchero-Franz Wagner partnership, this is a way to address them.\nIf San Antonio gets into the mix, it likely includes Stephon Castle or Dylan Harper. If Houston does, that means Alperen Sengun or Amen Thompson may be on the table. If Detroit registers interest, it could include Ausar Thompson. And if the Lakers are going to make a serious play here, they almost have to dangle Austin Reaves in a sign-and-trade. We have no idea if any of these teams will really mount an all-out pursuit next summer, but these are the names to watch. If the Bucks do have to trade Antetokounmpo, their first choice would be to get a young possible All-Star in return.The 'let's see how the playoffs go' groupThere are two categories here. The first are players on good teams facing a lot of pressure. Take Cleveland. The Cavaliers just traded Garland. Jarrett Allen was also in rumors. Mobley looks more capable of moving to center full time than he ever has. Allen is set to begin a pricey contract extension next offseason. If things don't go well this spring, you can bet he'll be gettable in the summer. Karl-Anthony Towns stands out as another example here. There was extensive reporting some of the frustrations New York's locker room had with him last season, and this year has been up and down. We seemingly learned at this year's deadline that Towns doesn't have much trade value, but if the Knicks flame out early, it's hard to imagine they don't at least explore his market further.I'm just going to throw out another name here. He probably won't hit the market. He's treated as sacred by his organization. I'd just like to ask... how long are the Heat going to be okay as a directionless Play-In team? They're headed for a fourth straight Play-In berth. They have no obvious path out of the middle of the East unless they can land Antetokounmpo. They have no star-level young player ready to lift them internally. So... is there a godfather offer out there somewhere for Bam Adebayo? Someone is probably eager to make it. Whether or not the Heat even pick up the phone is another matter. Now probably isn't the time, but how many more Play-In Tournaments do the Heat plan to participate in?\nThe other flavor of \"let's see how the playoffs go\" relates to younger teams, ideally the ones with assets to burn. These are the teams that might view themselves as one player away from a deep push and are therefore willing to pay a premium for someone specific, much like Orlando did with Bane last summer. The obvious name here would be Trey Murphy, as reports have indicated the Pelicans would want a Bane-esque package to consider trading him. Usually this group is bigger, but most of the teams near the bottom of the standings have already made their aggressive push to try to win next season, so their best assets aren't on the table. The time for a Lauri Markkanen trade has come and gone. The Hornets are playing far too well to consider a LaMelo Ball trade now.What's going on in Los Angeles?It's become a bit of an open secret that LeBron James and the Lakers are headed for a split. They've moved on to the Dončić era, and with their significant cap space this offseason they need to build a roster of role players around him and Reaves that can actually stick around and grow with them for the long haul. Putting aside all of the recent palace intrigue, the Lakers just can't keep turning over half of their roster every year or two. It's just not prudent to keep paying a 41-year-old.\nThere's not much money on the open market anymore. Most of the cap space teams this summer spent money at the deadline. The ones who remain aren't exactly the kind of contenders capable of giving James one last shot at a fifth ring. He's not signing with the Nets or Bulls. Only a small group of teams has any hope of luring him into a 24th season, probably for a minimum salary. The Knicks and Warriors will probably draw some consideration. If he plays next season, a Cleveland retirement tour is probably the favorite. He may simply retire.But there's another pretty interesting situation brewing with the other Los Angeles team. The Clippers entered the season hoping to contend with James Harden, Ivica Zubac and Kawhi Leonard. Harden and Zubac are both gone. There's really no reason to keep Leonard at this point. If he helps them win a few games next season, great, but they've moved on and have already starting building the next iteration of their team. If they can trade him for value, they should, though he may do everything in his power to squash a deal. He made it pretty clear in 2019 that he wants to be in Los Angeles.But what if that's no longer an option for him, at least as far as the Clippers go? The Aspiration investigation is still ongoing. We have no idea what the league has or hasn't found. If the NBA finds anything incriminating, it could theoretically void the rest of Leonard's contract and make him a free agent as it did Joe Smith when he and the Timberwolves were caught circumventing the cap decades ago. At that point, with very little money on the market, what does Leonard do? Take a discount to join the Lakers so he can stay in Los Angeles? Retire? Hop onto the contender of his choice for the minimum? Sit out a year and wait for more favorable cap conditions in 2027?\nWe're in reckless speculation territory at this point, but Leonard's future is one of the more interesting questions in the NBA right now. He's playing at an All-NBA level, and he's been reasonably healthy for several months now. That could change at any time, but as many headaches as Leonard creates, anyone this good is going to have a lot of interest in whatever manner they are available.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There was no shortage of impact trades leading up to Thursday's NBA trade deadline. Superstars who changed teams this season included Anthony Davis, James Harden, Jaren Jackson, Ivica Zubac, and Darius Garland. Let's sift through the aftermath and discuss five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Week 17 Fantasy Basketball Waiver WireKyle Filipowski, Utah Jazz (44% rostered)The Jazz have been a tanking team in recent seasons. They made their first big trade toimprove their roster immediately by acquiring Jaren Jackson Jr. from the Grizzlies. In the deal, they sent three first-round picks to Memphis. They have the potential to enter next season withan excellent starting lineup of Jackson, Lauri Markkanen, Walker Kessler, Keyonte George, andAce Bailey.Despite the addition of Jackson, the Jazz are still in line to try to improve their lottery oddsdown the stretch. They are 7.5 games back of the final play-in spot in the West and would needto overtake three teams to get there. The likelihood of that happening is slim. That means thatJackson, Markkanen, and Jusuf Nurkic should continue to see rest days. That's good news forFilipowski, who has averaged 11.5 points, 8.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.1 3-pointers over his last 13 games.Jaden Ivey, Chicago Bulls(41% rostered)The Bulls were one of the most active teams at the deadline. They traded away four key players in Nikola Vucevic, Coby White, Ayo Dosunmu, and Kevin Huerter. However, they aren't short onguards. In addition to holdovers Josh Giddey and Tre Jones, the Bulls acquired Ivey, Anfernee Simons, and Collin Sexton in various trades.\nSimons and Sexton are free agents after the season and likely aren't in the Bulls' rebuildingplans. Ivey is a restricted free agent, and the Bulls might be more inclined to try to keep himlong term. The former fifth overall pick played limited minutes for the Pistons in his return from aleg injury but still shot 45% from the field and 37.2% from behind the arc. He started in hisBulls debut Thursday, providing 13 points, four rebounds, six assists, three steals, and three3-pointers over 33 minutes. It appears he is lined up to play a lot down the stretch, whichmakes him a viable fantasy option in 12-team and deeper leagues.Jarace Walker, Indiana Pacers (34% rostered)The Pacers addressed their void at center by acquiring Ivica Zubac from the Clippers. They lostBennedict Mathurin as part of the trade, but their future is bright. When they get Tyrese Haliburton (Achilles) back for next season, they will have a stellar core of him, Zubac, Pascal Siakam, and Andrew Nembhard.With their eyes already on next season, the Pacers are likely to continue to try to improve theirlottery odds down the stretch. They only lose their 2026 first-round pick to the Clippers if it fallsbetween 5-9. However, if they can add a top-four selection to their already excellent startinglineup, they could easily vault right back to the top of the Eastern Conference. That means we should continue to see more minutes for some of their young players, one of whom is Walker.While averaging 26 minutes over their last 13 games, Walker has averaged 14 points, 4.8rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.3 steals, and 2.1 3-pointers.\nDe'Anthony Melton, Golden State Warriors (21% rostered)The Warriors reportedly tried to acquire Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Bucks, but the formerMVP ultimately stayed in Milwaukee. The Warriors did finally move Jonathan Kuminga, sendinghim and Buddy Hield to the Hawks for Kristaps Porzingis. Porzingis is a big name, but injuriesand illness have limited him to only 17 games this season. He has played at least 60 games in aseason just three times in his career.Expecting Porzingis to all of a sudden be healthy and play a lot is not realistic. The Warriors willcontinue to need added production from some of their role players, one of whom is Melton. Hehas battled his own injury issues, but Melton has averaged 13.9 points, 3.6 rebounds, 2.3assists, 1.5 steals, and 1.7 3-pointers across his last 18 games. He likely won't be playing 30minutes a game on a regular basis, but he can certainly play around 25 minutes a night. That'senough to warrant rostering him in many formats.GG Jackson, Memphis Grizzlies (25% rostered)The Grizzlies have already had frontcourt issues this season with Zach Edey (ankle) andBrandon Clarke (calf) playing a total of just 13 games. Neither player is expected back soon, so the trade of Jackson leaves the team with very little size. Outside of Santi Aldama, they don'thave many proven frontcourt options.\nGG Jackson figures to benefit from the Grizzlies' trade with the Jazz. He had already beenplaying more lately, averaging 24 minutes over the last seven games. With more opportunities, he provided 13.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.1 3-pointers. After shooting only37.2% from the field last season, Jackson is shooting 48.5% this season. He has the potential toplay around 25 minutes a game from here on out, making him worth taking a chance on infantasy.\n            ",

The 77-year-old spent more than four decades with the team in various capacities, and had been a staple in the broadcast booth since 1987.\"It's hard to believe I came to Toronto in a  trade in May of 1981, thinking that would be the end of a very good  career. Little did I know that I still  would be associated with the Blue Jays through the 2025 season,\" Martinez said in a statement. \"What a  glorious season it was. It was a joy and an honour to be involved in  each and every game through Game 7 of the World Series. Only one other  outcome could have topped the fantastic year. \"After the World Series, my  wife Arlene and I had plenty of time to think about the past and look  forward to our future. After many heartfelt conversations, we both  decided it was time for me to step out of the booth and enjoy the years  ahead ... I had hoped to be part of the 50th year of the  Toronto Blue Jays but it's time to pass the torch. Enjoy 2026 and  beyond, I will see you down the road.\"\nMartinez, a defense-first catcher, began his playing career with the Kansas City Royals (1969-77) and Milwaukee Brewers (1978-80) before going to the Blue Jays in a minor trade in May 1981. He played six years with Toronto and retired following the 1986 season with 1,049 games played in parts of 17 MLB seasons. \nThe very next year Martinez moved into the broadcast booth covering the Blue Jays. He broadcast Blue Jays games from 1987-2002 and 2010-25, with a seven-year stint covering the Baltimore Orioles sandwiched in from 2003-09. Martinez took a leave of absence to undergo cancer treatment in 2022.Following the 2000 season, the Blue Jays named Martinez their manager, and he led them to an 80-82 record in 2001 and to a 20-33 start to 2002 before being replaced in June. Martinez also managed Team USA in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006.\nMartinez has been honored by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe biggest NFL game of the year is just around the corner, as the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will take the field at Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl 60. According to the latest NFL odds, Seattle is favored by 4.5 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. The Seahawks are -230 money-line favorites, with the Patriots listed at +190. Much has been made of the dynamic talents and strong defenses on both sides. However, before the game kicks off, the team captains will meet at midfield for the opening coin toss, providing the most avid of sports bettors their first chance to get a win. Wagering on minutiae like the coin toss is a hallmark of Super Bowl betting, as sportsbooks like DraftKings will offer odds on just about everything, from the coin toss to the color of the Gatorade dumped on the winning coach.

For four straight years, I've made Tails my pick, and it's had a 50% success rate, but now I'm returning to my roots and backing the side that started it all, Heads.Why? They say \"tails never fails,\" but that is simply not true. \"They\" also said the Chiefs never fail, and there's no way the Ravens miss the playoffs, and Joe Burrow will get the Bengals back on track, and Jayden Daniels has the Commanders going in the right direction, and this might finally be the Lions' year. When all of that proved untrue, \"they\" said this has to be the year for Josh Allen and the Bills -- look at all the great teams that aren't in the playoffs!Instead, we get two teams that were +6000 or longer to win the Super Bowl prior to the season playing for the title. This has been the year of all years for defied expectations. Tails never fails? In the year of our Lord 2026? Give me Heads.(Also, as I say every year, only make this play if you're getting even odds. Despite the impeccable analysis above, there is a 50% chance for each side to win this year's Super Bowl coin toss.)Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

    "body": "\n        Five times in the last seven seasons, Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes was one of the Super Bowl's starting quarterbacks. To wrap up the 2025 season with Super Bowl LX, the football world gets a breath of fresh air with two first-time Super Bowl starters in Sam Darnold of the Seattle Seahawks and Drake Maye of the New England Patriots.Super Bowl LX will actually be the first Super Bowl ever between two starting quarterbacks and two head coaches -- Mike Macdonald of the Seahawks and Mike Vrabel of the Patriots -- who are all in their first or second season with their respective teams, per CBS Sports Research. However, that doesn't mean firepower is lacking at the position: Maye and Darnold have combined for 33 wins across the 2025 season, including playoffs, the most between two starting quarterbacks entering a Super Bowl matchup all time, according to CBS Sports Research.So which team -- the Patriots or the Seahawks -- has the edge at football's most important position entering its biggest game? Let's break it down with a tale of the tape that ended up being much closer than many would have thought.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Ranking every Patriots and Seahawks starter ahead of NFL championship devoid of star power\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRegular seasonMaye, the 2025 NFL MVP runner-up and 2025 second-team All-Pro, produced a regular season for the ages. He became the first quarterback since fellow Patriot Tom Brady in the 2007 16-0 regular season to lead the league with the best record (14-3), best completion percentage (72%) and passing yards per attempt (8.9). He's the sixth quarterback in the last 40 years to accomplish all of that in the same season, and the previous five -- Joe Montana (1989), Steve Young (1992, 1994), Kurt Warner (2001) and Brady (2007) -- all won league MVP honors for those efforts.\nAt age 23, Maye is also the youngest quarterback in NFL history to lead the league in both completion percentage and passing yards per attempt. He also paced the NFL in passer rating (113.5) and expected points added (EPA) per dropback (0.28).Darnold ranked right behind Maye in passing yards per attempt with an 8.5 average, and he finished top 10 in the NFL in the following passing metrics: W-L (14-3), completion percentage (67.7%) and passing yards (4,048). He had a strong regular season overall, but Darnold also maintained some of the chaos factor that led to Seattle being his fifth NFL team, as he led the league with 20 turnovers (14 interceptions, six lost fumbles).Drake Maye vs. Sam DarnoldMayeDarnoldW-L14-3*14-3*Completion percentage72%*67.7%Yards per pass attempt8.9*8.5Pass yards4,3944,048TD-INT31-825-14Passer rating113.5*99.1Expected points added (EPA) per dropback0.28*0.09Sacks4727Turnovers1120** Led NFLEdge: Maye PostseasonIn the playoffs, Darnold has found a higher level of play against familiar NFC West foes in the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams. He leads this postseason in yards per pass attempt (8.9), touchdown-to-interception ratio (4-0), passer rating (122.4) and EPA per dropback (0.38). Darnold also went cold turkey on turnovers, committing none in the NFC divisional round or NFC Championship Game.Maye, on the other hand, has taken a major step back in efficiency from his regular-season performance. New England is still winning, but his play hasn't been the driving factor. He leads the postseason with 15 sacks taken -- five in each game. That figure is nine more than the next-closest players -- Justin Herbert, C.J. Stroud and Matthew Stafford -- who each took six.Drake Maye vs. Sam DarnoldMayeDarnoldW-L3-0*2-0Completion percentage55.8%69.8%Yards per pass attempt6.98.9*Pass yards533470TD-INT4-24-0*Passer rating84.0122.4*Expected points added (EPA) per dropback-0.120.38*Sacks15*5Turnovers50** Led NFLEdge: DarnoldAccuracyIt doesn't get more accurate than leading the NFL in completion percentage like Maye did at a 72% clip. Darnold wasn't far behind at 67.7%. Even more impressive, Maye wasn't just throwing into wide-open spaces: his tight-window throw rate of 17.3% ranked as the fourth-highest in the league during the 2025 regular season. Darnold didn't throw into tight windows as frequently, posting a tight-window rate of 13.6%, which ranked 22nd out of 33 qualified quarterbacks.In the postseason, Darnold's accuracy -- like many aspects of his game -- improved. His 69.8% completion percentage ranks as the second-best this postseason behind Josh Allen's 71.6%. Maye's 55.8% completion percentage ranks eighth out of 15 playoff quarterbacks. However, Maye leading the NFL in completion percentage in the regular season while throwing into tight windows with regularity comes with a much larger sample size. He gets the edge here.Edge: Maye Ball securityWhen combining both players' turnover totals this season, Darnold's 20 (all from the regular season) exceed Maye's 16 across the regular season and playoffs.Yes, Maye's five playoff turnovers are tied for the second-most in the league with Caleb Williams and sit just two behind C.J. Stroud's playoff-worst seven. However, Maye still has four fewer turnovers than Darnold despite playing an extra game. Darnold leading the league in giveaways during the regular season is a tough hurdle to overcome.Edge: MayeBig-play magicBoth Super Bowl starting quarterbacks ranked top five this season in completion percentage on throws of 20-plus air yards, so the margin between the two in this area is thin. Darnold led the league in yards per pass attempt (18.5) on throws of 20-plus air yards, due in large part to his connection with 2025 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Jaxon Smith-Njigba. He completed 15 of 26 passes (57.7%) of 20-plus yards to Smith-Njigba while connecting on just over half (51.6%) when targeting all other Seahawks.Maye threw for 1,226 passing yards on throws of 20-plus air yards (including playoffs), the second-most in the NFL behind Stafford (1,519). New England's Week 3 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers was the only game, regular season or postseason, in which Maye did not connect on a throw of 20-plus air yards.Passes on throws of 20-plus air yards (NFL ranks)DarnoldMayeCompletion percentage52.5% (2nd)45.9% (5th)Yards per attempt18.5 (1st)14.4 (6th)Pass TD7 (T-7th)9 (T-4th)TD-INT7-2 (10th)9-4 (14th)Passer rating123.4 (2nd)108.1 (7th)Expected points added (EPA) per dropback0.90 (2nd)0.84 (4th)Darnold gets the edge here over Maye based on his leg up in efficiency.Edge: DarnoldPlay-action passingBoth Darnold and Maye rank as top-five quarterbacks this season, including the playoffs, in yards per pass attempt, passing touchdowns and passer rating off play action. The separator here is efficiency, something Maye has a leg up in, particularly when it comes to completion percentage, where he's nearly 10% higher, and ball security, with four fewer interceptions.Play-action passing (NFL ranks)DarnoldMayeCompletion percentage68.5% (11th)74.6% (4th)Yards per attempt11.0 (1st)9.8 (3rd)Pass TD15 (2nd)11 (T-4th)TD-INT15-5 (T-17th)11-1 (8th)Passer rating124.7 (4th)128.8 (3rd)Expected points added (EPA) per dropback0.30 (4th)0.26 (9th)Edge: MayeRushing impactMaye's 5.9 rushing yards per carry rank second among all players with at least 10 carries this postseason, trailing only Jacksonville Jaguars running back Travis Etienne (6.7). Darnold has just three carries for nine yards this postseason, something certainly impacted by the oblique injury he dealt with in the divisional round.In the regular season, Maye's 450 rushing yards ranked fourth among quarterbacks, while Darnold's 95 rushing yards ranked 33rd. An easy advantage for Maye here.Edge: MayePocket presenceMaye's 15 sacks are the second-most taken by any player in a single postseason in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), per NFL Next Gen Stats. His 47 regular-season sacks are also the second-most by any quarterback to go on to start the Super Bowl. It's not all on him, as his average time to throw of 3.01 seconds was the sixth-fastest among the 15 quarterbacks to start a playoff game this postseason, but his awareness when the pocket collapses needs to improve.Darnold took 10 fewer sacks this postseason with a slightly faster average time to throw of 2.98 seconds. The Seahawks quarterback, now in his eighth NFL season, holds the edge over Maye in this area, which makes sense given that 2025 was just the Patriots passer's second year as a pro.\nEdge: Darnold\n        \n            \n                Five bold Super Bowl LX predictions that sound far-fetched -- until you look into the data\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSuper Bowl experienceMaye is aiming to become the first quarterback since Tom Brady (2001) to win a Super Bowl in the season of his first playoff start. Darnold, now on his fifth NFL team, is angling to become the fourth quarterback to win a Super Bowl on his third team or later, and the first to do so on his fourth team or later.Edge: DrawHead-to-head historyYes, quarterbacks face opposing defenses, but the game is still very much discussed as quarterback vs. quarterback. Eli Manning beat Tom Brady twice in the Super Bowl despite Brady actually facing the New York Giants' ferocious four-man pass rush in those two matchups. Super Bowl LX will mark the first time Darnold and Maye share the field in the same game.Edge: DrawThe final verdictThe tally from our 10 categories, with two recorded as draws, is as follows:Drake Maye (5)Sam Darnold (3)This is a little closer than some would have thought when evaluating these two quarterbacks on the surface. Darnold certainly closed the gap in the postseason against two division opponents, so it will be interesting to see how he fares against a former division foe in the Patriots.However, he hasn't faced New England since the 2021 season, when he started against them as a member of the Carolina Panthers. He has since developed significantly while being coached by Kyle Shanahan with the 49ers, Kevin O'Connell with the Vikings and Klint Kubiak with the Seahawks.The Patriots can certainly take solace in having the MVP runner-up in Maye at the controls of their offense on Sunday, but he'll have his work cut out for him against Seattle's No. 1 scoring defense (17.2 points per game allowed in the regular season).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN FRANCISCO -- The NFL MVP award was handed out at NFL Honors on Thursday night and in one of the closest races in league history, Matthew Stafford edged Drake Maye to take home the award. Once the NFL season hit December, the MVP battle was widely viewed as a two-horse race between Stafford and Maye, but they only ended up accounting for 47 of the 50 first-place votes. That means there were three voters that didn't put Maye or Stafford on top of their ballot and those three votes essentially ended up deciding the MVP race. How is that possible? Well, let's break down how the vote works. The panel that votes on the MVP (and all the other awards) is selected by the Associated Press. There are 50 voters and each of them are asked to rank five players on their ballot. A first-place is worth 10 points, a second-place vote is worth five points, a third-place vote is worth three points, a second-place vote is worth two points and a fifth-place vote is worth one point. With that in mind, here's how the vote broke down for the MVP: 1. Matthew Stafford: 366 points (24 first-place votes)2. Drake Maye: 361 (23)3. Josh Allen: 91 (2)4. Christian McCaffrey: 71 (0)5. Trevor Lawrence: 49 (0)\nOf the three first-place votes that did NOT go to Stafford or Maye, two of them went to Josh Allen. So where did that last vote go? It went to Justin Herbert. Yes, Justin Herbert. The voter who put Herbert at the top of his ballot explained his vote on Thursday night. \nYou could certainly make a case for Allen or Herbert to win MVP, but it's hard to justify having them at the top of your ballot. And the crazy part is that our Herbert and Allen voters essentially decided the race. The final tally was so close that if any of the Allen or Herbert votes had gone in Maye's favor, then he would have won or at least tied with Stafford. \nConsider these two scenarios: Scenario 1: If Monson had given his first-place vote to Drake Maye and had Herbert second on his ballot, then the Patriots quarterback would have least tied for MVP. That one simple change would have turned the race upside down. Scenario 2: If one of the Josh Allen voters had instead put Maye on top of their ballot, then once again, the Patriots QB would have been MVP. Although Monson was more than willing to take the heat for his Herbert ballot, it's still not clear who voted for Allen. The Bills quarterback played in the same division as Maye and couldn't even win it. You could certainly argue that Allen had to carry the offense, but that wasn't even necessarily the case. Allen had James Cook in his backfield and Cook led the NFL in rushing this year. In a year where two quarterbacks seemed to be a cut ahead of everyone else, these three voters decided to go another route with their vote and it ended up helping Stafford take home his first career MVP. Of course, we don't know for sure that these three votes cost Maye the MVP. If all three of these voters had Stafford ahead of Maye, then that means Stafford was going to win anyway. It's OK to think outside the box, but sometimes, you get so far outside the box that you can't even see the box anymore, and that feels like what happened here. If these three voters had gone with Maye at the top of their ballot, then we would have had a different outcome. Instead, we got the closest MVP race since 2003 when Peyton Manning finished in a tie with Steve McNair. It's worth noting that both Maye and Stafford both received at least one third-place vote. The AP released the full ballot of every voter last year, but that hasn't happened yet this year. If it does come out, we'll update things here with a bigger breakdown. \nLosing the MVP might actually end up being a good thing for Maye, because Patriots quarterbacks never seem to win the Super Bowl and MVP in the same year. Tom Brady went to the Super Bowl twice in the same year that he won MVP and went 0-2 in those games (2007, 2017). And since 2000, the NFL MVP is 1-9 in the Super Bowl. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        47 days until Opening Day ... You only get the one first-round pick every year, and it's the most valuable asset you have in building your Fantasy Baseball team. But one first-rounder isn't enough. Something could go wrong with your first-round pick, of course, but you also just need multiple players to produce like first-rounders to really be a championship contender. But here's the thing: If you draft right, you can overcome something going wrong. We had high-stakes player Mike Mager on Fantasy Baseball Today this week to talk Auction/Salary Cap draft strategies, and Mager won the NFBC Auction Championship overall prize last season despite Yordan Alvarez being his highest-priced player. How'd he do it? Well, he got a first-round (and more) caliber season out of Cal Raleigh, which went a long way toward getting him to the promised land. Raleigh's emergence as one of the best hitting catchers in MLB history for at least one season wasn't exactly part of the plan, but correctly identifying him as a target with upside was clearly a smart play. Any road to a Fantasy championship is likely going to require multiple elite, impact players to get you there, so you've got to find players who can make that first-round impact elsewhere. If it's in the second round, that's great; if it's in the 10th, well, that's even better. What we're looking for today are players being picked outside of the first round this season who could end up there this time next year. Here are 13 candidates: \nNext year's first-round contendersGunnar Henderson, SS, Orioles Current ADP: 15.5We'll start with a guy who was a first-rounder this time last season. I have some concerns about whether Henderson's ceiling is truly as high as we thought when he looked like one of the best hitters in baseball in the first half of 2024, but I don't really hold his 2025 struggles against him. He dealt with a spring intercostal strain and fought through a shoulder injury the rest of the way, and even then, it's not like his underlying skills really took much of a hit – his strikeout rate declined for the third year in a row, while his average exit velocity was down 0.7 mph from 2024 but actually up from 2023. Henderson clearly wasn't right in 2025, but he wasn't totally wrecked either, and if the floor in an injury-wrecked season is 17 homers and 30 steals, it's not hard to see how first-round production is still the ceiling. He's still just 24 until late June, so this one feels like a fairly safe bet. Junior Caminero, 3B, RaysCurrent ADP: 14.6Caminero is currently going off boards just ahead of Henderson, but I think his path to first-round value is probably a bit murkier. That's not a knock on Caminero; it's just recognizing that his game, right now, isn't quite as fantasy-friendly as Henderson's.Of course, if you buy Caminero as a true talent 40-homer guy, the path is a lot clearer. It basically comes down to whether he can retain his elite power while tapping into a better batting average. The skill set wasn't there in 2025 despite Caminero's strong quality of contact metrics and below-average strikeout rate, because his swing isn't quite optimized just yet. He hits the ball in the air a decent amount, with good pull-size power, hence the 45 homers. But he combines both an above-average pop-up rate (8.5%, compared to 7.1% for the league) and an unusually high number of balls classified as \"topped\" by BaseballSavant.com (36.2%; average is 32.4%), and you just aren't going to find batting average with those types of batted balls.\nAnd if you aren't going to steal bases (Caminero's sprint speed was 30th percentile in 2025, and he hasn't had more than seven steals in a season since 2022), you need to be truly helpful in batting average to be a first-round pick. Caminero didn't hurt you with his .264 mark last season, but his .255 xBA doesn't suggest there's an imminent breakout coming in that category. But he's so young, and the bat-to-ball skills are so strong that I'm certainly not writing it off. A .285 average and 40 homers are well within Caminero's range of possible outcomes. Kyle Tucker, OF, DodgersCurrent ADP: 17.7You might argue that Tucker already deserves to be in the first round if you are Scott White. I think that argument is persuasive, and I think Tucker has become kind of underrated, thanks mostly to some fluky injuries over the past two seasons. His 2024 was derailed by a misdiagnosed fracture in his leg, and then the same thing happened to a fractured hand that he ultimately played through in 2025. But when Tucker is on the field, I don't think there's any question he is a first-round caliber player – his 162-game average over the past three seasons is .278-107-32-102-29. And now he's playing in the best lineup in baseball. If you're scared off by the injuries, I can't imagine there's much I could say to convince you that they just aren't likely to be an issue in 2026, and if he stays healthy, I think you're getting first-round production out of him. Nick Kurtz, 1B, AthleticsCurrent ADP: 18.4My heart really isn't in this one, because the path is basically, \"Become Aaron Judge.\" Kurtz wasn't far off Judge's rookie season, but where Judge's .430 wOBA in 2017 was backed up by a .450 xwOBA, Kurtz's .419 mark came with a .372 xwOBA. He hits the ball hard, but not quite as hard as Judge, and it doesn't seem likely Kurtz can match Judge's relatively modest stolen base upside – and his plate discipline as a rookie was markedly worse than Judge's, too. \nBut you know, what? If you can hit 50 homers, you have first-round upside. Kurtz has the raw power to get there, and a home park that should help him a lot on the way there. 50 homers is a big ask, but as long as Kurtz is capable of it, a first-round outcome is within the realm of possibility. Pete Crow-Armstrong, OF, CubsCurrent ADP: 30.6I toyed with doing a \"/James Wood\" here, but if Wood isn't going to be a big base-stealing threat, it's just a lot harder to make the case for him as a potential first-rounder. Wood has the raw power to be a consistent 40-homer threat, but he struck out nearly 40% of the time in the second half last season and still doesn't have his swing geared toward lifting the ball and maximizing his immense raw power, which makes his path to first-round value even tougher to traverse.Crow-Armstrong is kind of a mirror image of Wood, on the other hand. His physical tools as a hitter are significantly weaker, but he's much more optimized. Despite some of the worst swing decisions in baseball and pretty average raw power, Crow-Armstrong's power plays up thanks to his lift-and-pull swing. He doesn't hit the ball hard nearly as often as Wood does, but he's a lot better about hitting the ball in the air to the shorter parts of the fence, which is how he nearly matched Wood's homer output despite hitting the ball nearly five mph less hard on average.\nAnd, of course, Crow-Armrstrong did that while stealing 35 bases, which is the real edge he has on Wood. If he can improve the plate discipline a bit, you can see Crow-Armstrong pushing that batting average closer to .270, which would put him a lot closer to the Francisco Lindor range of players. I don't have a lot of faith in Crow-Armstrong's plate discipline improving enough to get there, but you can see the path. Logan Gilbert, SP, MarinersCurrent ADP: 35.2It was an up-and-down season for Gilbert, who missed some time with an elbow issue and took a step back in ERA and WHIP from his breakout 2024 campaign. But there were signs that this might have been the best version of Gilbert we've ever seen, too. His splitter has emerged in recent years as one of the best swing-and-miss pitches in the game, and he has a whole arsenal of other weapons to lean on, en route to a 32.3% strikeout rate last season, which would have just edged out Tarik Skubal for the best mark among starters if he had enough innings to qualify. The lingering injury risk is a concern, but if Gilbert can consolidate the strikeout gains from 2025 while getting back to being a 200-inning guy, I think \"best pitcher in Fantasy\" is within the range of outcomes here. Wyatt Langford, OF, RangersCurrent ADP: 49.7Part of me wants to put this discussion to rest with Langford, who has been overdrafted in consecutive years by Fantasy players convinced he is one of the most talented players in baseball. But then I take a step back and think about this: As a 23-year-old, Langford just went for 22 homers and 22 steals in 134 games despite dealing with an oblique injury on four separate occasions. Oblique injuries are one of the worst for hitters to deal with, as they tend to sap rotational explosiveness, which is what hitting is all about. Despite that, Langford saw across-the-board improvements in quality of contact, and while his strikeout rate moved in the wrong direction, his swing decisions and contact skills still suggest he deserves better than a 26% strikeout rate.\nWhich is all to say, while I'm not necessarily pushing Langford aggressively up my draft boards to make sure I end up with him, I'm much more open to drafting him at his current cost than I was the previous two seasons. There's clearly a strong, well-rounded skill set here, and it's not unreasonable to think he could develop into a Kyle Tucker-esque contributor very quickly – though his home park will never help him in the power department, which is one big hurdle. Cole Ragans, SP, RoyalsCurrent ADP: 51.2Ragans is kind of a more extreme version of the case for Gilbert. He missed significant time with shoulder issues, but when he was on the mound, Ragans was dominant. The 4.67 ERA doesn't tell that story, but the 2.68 xERA, 2.50 FIP, and 38.1% strikeout rate sure do. The injury track record here is long and features a very recent scare, though the fact that Ragans was able to return to strike out 22 in 13 innings at the end of the season counts as a good sign in my eyes. Ragans is one of the biggest boom-or-bust pitchers on the board in 2026 drafts, but there aren't many pitchers whose boom outcomes could be more impactful than what he flashed last season. Roman Anthony, OF, Red Sox Current APD: 56.1Anthony is another one who doesn't have prototypical first-rounder speed, though his four steals in 71 games suggest there should at least be 10-steal upside here. But if he's going to get to the first round, it's going to be because he mashes his way there. Anthony doesn't have Kurtz's penchant for elevating the ball with authority, but the raw power is there – his 94.5 mph average exit velocity and 60.3% hard-hit rate as a 21-year-old rookie both would have ranked among the four highest marks among all hitters if he qualified for leaderboards. He didn't elevate the ball enough to tap into it as a rookie, though that did start to change, and he put up a .407 xwOBA over his final 100 plate appearances, a mark only Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, and Shohei Ohtani matched last season. \nA pre-2024 Soto isn't a terrible comp if you're looking for a best-case scenario outcome for Anthony; he won't walk as much as Soto, though he'll walk plenty, and his home park could help him be a more consistent batting average contributor than Soto. All in all, if you're making the case for Anthony, you're looking for someone who could hit .280-plus with 30 homers and huge contributions in runs and RBI, while not being a zero in steals. And in a H2H points league, the path to first-round viability is even clearer with a doubles-over-homers approach and plenty of walks. Anthony could absolutely be one of the five or so best hitters in baseball soon enough. Brice Turang, 2B, BrewersCurrent ADP: 65.7You're skeptical of Turang's power surge in 2025? Me too! It came along with a bat speed spike that showed up in the first week of the season, though the results on the field took a while to actually manifest – he hit just six homers through the end of July before crushing 10 in August … only to hit just two more in September. Did Turang have a power breakout, or did he have a good month? It's perfectly fair to be skeptical, but for the purposes of this exercise, we're mostly focused on what could happen for these players in a best-case scenario, and well, I think Turang's best-case scenario very well may be that of a first-round player. He needs to replicate the best parts of his 2025 season (.288 average, 18 HR, 178 combined runs and RBI) with the base-stealing proficiency he showed in 2024, when he swiped 50. It's not the likeliest outcome on the board, but we are talking about a guy who has already shown all the skills we need to see at different points. Now he just has to put them all together. \nKyle Bradish, SP, OriolesCurrent ADP: 76.8I'm not the first person to make this comp, but … is anyone getting 2024 Tarik Skubal vibes from Bradish? Bradish comes in with a higher pre-injury floor than Skubal, while Skubal's post-injury dominance lasts a bit longer than Bradish's, but the point is, both flashed legitimate ace upside coming off elbow surgeries. Now, the question is whether Bradish can sustain it like Skubal did. Bradish, of course, established himself as a very useful pitcher in 2023, when he finished fourth in AL Cy Young voting with a 2.83 ERA in 168.2 innings. He did that with a good, but not great, 25% strikeout rate, however. Then he came out in 2024 after dealing with a sprained elbow and struck out 32.5% of opposing batters before ultimately needing Tommy John surgery. When he returned in 2025, he was even better, sporting a 37.3% strikeout rate, with his pre-injury velocity completely intact. The Skubal comp is probably unfair, but that's the kind of pitcher Bradish has been over the past two seasons when he has been healthy. He enters 2026 healthy and without obvious innings limitations and has Cy Young upside if he can simply keep doing what he's done lately. \nGeraldo Perdomo, SS, DiamondbacksCurrent ADP: 79.1Nobody expected Perdomo to be a first-round caliber player, including someone like me, who is notably significantly higher on Perdomo than the consensus. Which is weird, because Perdomo was the No. 15 player in Roto scoring last season, while he was the ninth-highest scorer in H2H points leagues. Nobody buys it, of course, because it came out of nowhere – a .235/.327/.330 hitter in his first four partial MLB seasons, Perdomo broke out with a .290/.389/.462 line last season.And I don't expect him to be quite that good again. For one thing, getting 720 plate appearances in a season just doesn't happen very often; over the past five seasons, only Marcus Semien (three times), Shohei Ohtani, Matt Olson, and Kyle Schwarber (twice) have done it multiple times. So, if nothing else, you would expect some regression from Perdomo's 198 combined runs and RBI. But he's a supreme contact hitter who showed real bat speed improvements last season, leading to a 19.9% pulled-air rate and 25.5% line drive rate, two key ways to overcome otherwise middling quality of contact skills.But then there's this: Of the 16 batted balls hit at least 400 feet in his career, nine came in 2025, and six of those came from Aug. 13 or later. There was seemingly a real change in skills here for Perdomo that projections systems may not be capturing. If he can be a 20-homer guy in this lineup with his plate discipline and speed, Perdomo could shock everyone by simply repeating what he did in 2025. \nKonnor Griffin, SS, PiratesCurrent ADP: 214.9The thing to know here is that Griffin will almost certainly never actually cost this price in drafts. He's going to keep rising as we approach the start of Spring Training, and then he'll either get pushed close to the top-100 if it becomes clear he's playing his way into a spot on the Pirates' Opening Day lineup or tumble if it looks like he's heading back down to the minors. Based on the fact that Griffin doesn't turn 20 until a month into the season and has played just 21 games above A ball, reasonable money would be on Griffin heading back to the minors for additional seasoning, but I'm not sure reason needs to win out here.For one thing, the Pirates need to give their fan base (and Paul Skenes) a reason to believe they're going to compete soon. And for another thing, Griffin might just be so talented that he justifies skipping the high minors. He's pretty much the consensus top prospect in baseball and has drawn numerous Mike Trout comparisons coming off a .333/.415/.527 line with 21 homers and 65 steals in his first pro season. Making the leap to the majors as a teenager is asking a lot, but Griffin has already proven to be an outlier with how quickly he established himself last season, and while the Trout comparisons might be unfair, he has the look of a Fantasy difference maker at some point. If not Trout, he could still be Fernando Tatis, Ronald Acuna, or even Corbin Carroll or Julio Rodriguez, all of whom established themselves as first-round talents more or less immediately. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lindsey Vonn is pulling off the seemingly-impossible task of continuing her Olympic journey, despite a torn ACL, bone bruise and meniscus damage. Vonn sustained the injury Jan. 30, when she crashed in a World Cup race and it was assumed it meant the end of her Olympic comeback.With the 2026 Milano Cortina games beginning on Feb. 6, Vonn wasn't left much time for recovery before her scheduled events. She was adamant that the injury did not mean the end of her Winter Games return and took the first step to making that come true on Friday.Vonn took to the slopes for the first time since the injury, participating in an official Olympic training event for women's downhill skiing. She did not appear to have any setbacks in the run.\nRegardless of where Vonn finishes at the Games, just making it back on the slopes this quick is shocking and impressive. Olympic fans are stunned at her determination as the 41-year-old enters her fifth Olympics.  \nThe recovery time for a torn ACL is usually six to nine months, but athletes could need longer before they return to full intensity workouts. A complete recovery is not expected for most patients until a year, according to the Cleveland Clinic.There are three types of ACL tears, with Grade One being the least severe and Grade Three being the most severe. It is not publicly known which level tear Vonn has. Since the ACL is surrounded by a joint fluid that inhibits the healing process, most cannot heal on their own. Most ACL tears require surgery to repair, especially for athletes who want to return to their sport.Vonn's first event, women's downhill, is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 8 at 5:30 a.m. She also plans to compete in super-G and the team combined event. The three-time Olympic medalist had to sit out a World Cup super-G race the Saturday after the injury, but she's determined to make that the only run she misses.\n\"I'm still here. I think I'm still able to fight. I think I'm still able to try,\" Vonn said. \"And I will try as long as I have the ability to, I will not go home regretting not trying. I will do everything in my power to be in that starting gate.\"Vonn initially retired in 2019 due to numerous injuries and after a partial knee replacement in April of 2024 she decided to unretire. Vonn now has a titanium implant in her right knee.  Vonn said as long as there is a chance for her to compete this year, she will take the chance and reflected on how this injury has been different than previous ones. \n\"I haven't cried. I haven't deviated from my plan.\" Vonn told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday while speaking about her injury. \"Normally, in the past, there's always a moment where you break down and you realize the severity of things and that your dreams are slipping through your fingers. But I didn't have that this time. I'm not letting this slip through my fingers. I'm gonna do it. End of story.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -230 money line favorites (risk $230 to win $100), while the Patriots are +190 underdogs. Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III is -195 (risk $195 to win $100) to score a touchdown, Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is -110 and Patriots RB Rhamondre Stevenson is +140.

White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX. Seattle safety Nick Emmanwori (ankle) missed practice on Thursday. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Theoretically, Kristaps Porziņģis is a perfect player for the Warriors, who've long been searching for a stretch five who can protect the rim to play alongside Draymond Green. Al Horford was considered a tailor-made fit for the same reasons. Now the Warriors have both of them, as the Celtics did when they won it all in 2024. But two years ago is another lifetime in NBA time, and in this lifetime, Horford and Porziņģis are not the players they were in Boston. Porziņģis, specifically, has been stricken with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), a life-altering autoimmune disease that can cause, among other symptoms, dizziness, fainting, rapid heart rate, palpitations, blurred vision and extreme fatigue primarily when \"standing upright.\" Porziņģis, who managed just 42 games last season, has played only 17 times so far this season. He played twice in December and hasn't played at all since Jan. 7. ESPN's Anthony Slater has reported that Porziņģis could be ready to go for the Warriors maybe as soon as Saturday against the Lakers, and Steve Kerr says the Warriors did their \"due diligence\" and would not have made the trade if they didn't believe they could manage Porziņģis' health and keep him on the court. \nThat sounds great, but Porziņģis has had plenty of injury issues outside of the POTS diagnosis, and ultimately he hasn't been the player we saw in Boston for any stretch of time over the last year. Color me skeptical that a chronically injured 7-footer who has added an autoimmune disease to his list of ailments is going to all of a sudden turn up healthy. \nSo what, then, do we make of this trade? Well, for starters, Kerr has already admitted the Warriors have an \"absolutely lower\" ceiling than they did with a healthy Jimmy Butler, which is equal parts obvious and depressing for a coach, even though he's simply speaking the truth, to be so openly resigned to the consolation bracket. \nProbably the most important element of this trade is it brings the Jonathan Kuminga saga to a merciful close. He plays for the Hawks now. He wasn't playing much, if at all, for the Warriors before Jimmy Butler got hurt, but this was an emotional cloud hanging over the franchise. Getting out from beneath that is a win in itself. \n        \n            \n                Kristaps Porziņģis-Jonathan Kuminga trade grades: Warriors, Hawks take upside swings\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere are going to a lot of Warriors fans disappointed in this deadline, with only Porziņģis to show for a lead-up that heavily teased the possibility of Giannis Antetokounmpo. Bear in mind, that dream isn't totally dead. Milwaukee is reportedly looking for a package that, as ESPN's Shams Charania phrased it, \"blows them away\" with as many as five first-round draft picks coming back to them. This summer, the Warriors indeed have ways to create five trade-eligible first-round picks. \nOf course this is the issue many Warriors fans have taken with Golden State's approach to roster management over the past few years: They've been holding onto the pipe dream of Giannis at the expense of using some of that capital to pursue other moves. That's not entirely true. They got Jimmy Butler, though he only cost them a protected first-round pick -- which wound up being the No. 20 selection last summer, where the Heat selected Kasparas Jakucionis, who has started to look pretty good.What's frustrating to many is that they waited until Kuminga's value hit rock bottom before they acted, just as they did with James Wiseman. Reportedly, those were the two guys that Joe Lacob... shall we say... strongly encouraged his front office to take when the actual basketball people preferred the likes of Franz Wagner and Trey Murphy. Wiseman, in hindsight, should've been traded before he was ever selected for a win-now player. But Lacob became obsessed with proving his ability to author an equally successful sequel to this Warriors dynasty, for which Curry, deservedly, will always be credited. Had Lacob prioritized the maximization of the remainder of Curry's career all along, there were moves to be made. But oince it got this far, Kuminga was effectively worthless. \nNow, just because the Warriors probably should've been looking to be more aggressive with their future draft capital all along doesn't mean they should've overcorrected and tred to make up for that with an irresponsible deadline move. Just for argument's sake, they could have gotten Anthony Davis for nothing, but he's owed $112 million in guaranteed money over the next two years. The aforementioned Murphy might be one of those players who has priced himself out of a reasonable market; he's too good for a modest package but tough to justify giving up, say, four picks to land. That's Mikal Bridges and Desmond Bane territory, and neither of those deals look great right now. It's not to say the Warriors couldn't have gotten a real difference maker at this deadline. The Jazz got Jaren Jackson Jr. for three picks. The Pacers for Ivica Zubac for two first-rounders. You add Jackson to Golden State's already very good defense, and his stretch shooting alongside Curry, and you can do some things. Zubac is a tougher fit as a non-shooter, but a terrific defender and finisher. \nBefore that Jackson deal went down, would the Jazz have listened to an offer for Lauri Markkanen that was close to what Golden State was offering for Giannis? Maybe a year ago, but by holding onto Walker Kessler and trading for JJJ they've announced their intentions to compete themselves. Besides that, a Giannis package for Markannen is an overpay. It can be argued that a little bit of an overpay to give Curry an honest shot in the West is worth it, but the Warriors have proven they're not going to do that. What they will do is make a move like the Butler one that doesn't cost them much, or they'll offer everything for Giannis. But as far as these middle-ground moves, a Murphy or Michael Porter Jr. (might the Heat have listened to an offer for Norman Powell, who's on an expiring contract?), they don't believe those are enough, ultimately, to make them an honest contender, and short of that they're not coming out of the stubborn corner into which they've painted themselves. So Porziņģis is it. \nIt's a letdown in light of the Giannis hope, but if -- and again, this is a massive IF -- Porziņģis can be healthy come the postseason (assuming the Warriors make it that far), he does fill a longtime need. Beyond that, he could re-sign next season at a reasonable number that allows for other moves, or even be part of a sign-and-trade. Golden State isn't giving up on Giannis. The Warriors are also probably not going to get him. And the truth is, the longer they continue to live in that dream world, the shorter their time to make one last push with Curry becomes. \n            ",

The Thunder lead the league in scoring and rank among the top three in field goal percentage, 2-point percentage and free throw percentage. As for the Wolves, they own the No. 5 scoring offense and also boast top-5 rankings in field goal percentage and 3-point percentage.OKC will be without defensive ace Alex Caruso (adductor) and All-Defensive member in Jalen Williams, while Cason Wallace (hip), who ranks second in the NBA with 2.1 steals per game, is questionable. That's lots of firepower on the defensive end for the Thunder, which is why the model projects them to allow nearly 5 more points than their regular season average. With that, the Over hits 51.8% of the time.It has also generated an against-the-spread pick that hits well over 50% of simulations. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. \nSo who wins Thunder vs. Wolves, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Timberwolves vs. Thunder spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nine months after he outpointed Diego Lopes for the vacant featherweight title, Alexander Volkanovski will make the first defense of his second title reign on Saturday in a rematch headlining UFC 325 in Sydney, Australia. The biggest narrative surrounding the rematch, which was booked just months after Lopes rebounded to finish Jean Silva in a thrilling slugfest headlining Noche UFC in September, is whether Lopes (27-7) can improve at all on his performance at UFC 314 when he dropped and twice hurt Volkanovski (27-4) but was unable to put him away in a clear decision loss. Even though Lopes even getting the immediate rematch was somewhat controversial in the eyes of fans considering he leapfrogged top contenders Movsar Evloev (who defeated him in 2023) and Lerone Murphy, the 31-year-old native of Brazil has said all of the right things about what he learned from his loss to Volkanovski. \"When I look back at the first fight, I know that I had big moments but I am grateful because the first fight with Volk taught me a lot of different things [about] my life and my career,\" Lopes told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"I fixed those things and now I am a completely different fighter compared to the first fight. Now, I have the experience [of] fighting five rounds and now I have the experience of being in the main event with the cameras behind me. Nothing is new for me now so I don't have the pressure.\"\nSign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Lopes, who moved to Mexico at age 19 to become a jiu-jitsu instructor and where he has now set up shop at the Lobo Gym in Guadalajara, now readily admits the moment was too big for him nine months ago and it forced him to abandon his wrestling, throw away his coaches' gameplan and methodically follow Volkanovski around the cage -- without cutting it off -- in search of a one-punch knockout. \n        \n            \n                UFC 325 predictions, odds, best bets: Alexander Volkanovski, Benoit Saint Denis among top picks to consider\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe simplistic nature of Lopes' attack turned out to be easy pickings for Volkanovski, who picked Lopes apart in the opening round (before surviving a knockdown of his own in Round 2) and was able to turn back the clock by reclaiming the 145-pound title he had lost one year earlier via second-round knockout against Ilia Topuria. It's likely because Lopes made the fight so easy for Volkanovski in their first meeting that the 37-year-old legend isn't expecting a more difficult time in the rematch.\n\"I think there is a lot that I can capitalize on [because] I'm capable of changing things and [utilizing] a new strategy,\" Volkanovski told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"Whether I want to take him down or fight at short range, I feel like I can make whatever adjustments are needed. But for him -- and this is not a knock on him -- but, what is he capable of? I hear people say that he is going to improve so much but I don't think I saw that in his last fight, to be honest. \"How much is he capable of changing? And, if he tries to, is that going to hold him back from what he does best? If he tries to outstrategize me, I think that just makes it a lot harder for him. And if he does plan on doing that, that's going to completely change halfway through the first round.\" The biggest potential improvement for Lopes should come on the ground. Not only does he have an excellent submission base as the longtime jiu-jitsu coach of former UFC women's flyweight champion Alexa Grasso, he has committed himself to improving upon his wrestling game after all but abandoning it against Volkanovski. \nLopes, who made multiple trips in 2025 to Oklahoma State University to train under the guidance of former U.S. Olympic gold medalist David Taylor, showed improvements on the ground against Silva last fall when he utilized takedowns and top control to dominate his countryman in the opening round by landing heavy damage. \"In the first fight, many people asked me why I didn't try to take [Volkanovski] down,\" Lopes said. \"It's because I just tried to finish him with a big punch and a big connection but I forgot the gameplan. At the weigh in, I told my coach that maybe I would try to take him down but [Volkanovski] was a lot shorter, which makes it difficult. He is also so physically strong, too. But this time, I am more calm and more confident. Now, I want to take him down and use my jiu-jitsu and be more of a mixed martial artist.\"Although Volkanovski praised the danger level of Lopes' high-level submission game and the improvements he showed in taking Silva down, he doesn't expect it to be much of a factor in their second fight. \n\"For me, bring that on,\" Volkanovski said. \"Everyone knows about my takedown defense and wherever he takes it, I think it's going to be a rough night for him. I just have to prevent him from landing that big shot.\" \nIt's that one big shot that Volkanovski does have a lot of respect for. Lopes bloodied the left eye of Volkanovski in Round 2 and later dropped him in the closing seconds with a clubbing overhand right. Lopes also won Round 4 on two of the three judges' scorecards after hurting him with a right uppercut to the left eye that forced a wincing Volkanovski to shoot for a takedown.\"You have to put [Lopes' power] right up there because if you just look at the technique, even when he's landing, it's not even pure technique,\" Volkanovski said. \"It's sort of out of position punches. He even has a weird style sort of punch where mechanically it's not how you would fire a punch. Like, Ilia Topuria has got this perfect technique so you can understand why there is so much power behind it. But [Lopes] doesn't even need technique and it's just sheer power. \n\"I was hurting after that fight, I'll be honest. I had stitches all over me and was banged up. I had stitches inside my mouth and obviously I couldn't see out of my eye during the fourth round. So, I definitely felt the punches after, anyway.\"Volkanovski, who hasn't fought since his victory over Lopes, said that he loves when critics mention his age because that only makes his victories more sweet. Lopes, meanwhile, said that he hopes to bring the same type of chaos to the rematch that he thrived in during his wild second round against Silva, which ended with Lopes knocking him out with a spinning back elbow. For Volkanovski, a victory would give him a sixth featherweight title defense, which would place him one short of Jose Aldo's UFC record for the division and further make the case for \"Alexander the Great,\" who defeated Aldo by decision in 2019, as the greatest 145-pound fighter in history. But for Lopes, the motivation to bring home a world title is entirely different. \n\"I left my house like 11 years ago and I told my mom and my dad, 'Look, I'm leaving. I'm trying to look for the best life for all of us and I promise one day I will be champion of UFC,'\" Lopes said. \"Now, I have like 50 percent of this accomplished in my life. I can [provide] the best life for my mom, my dad and my brothers but I have one more thing and that's [to be] the best. I have this chance now. My goal is to take the belt and take a flight back to my city [of Manaus, Brazil] and to take the belt and say, 'Mom and dad, here. My promise is accomplished.'\"Who wins Volkanovski vs. Lopes, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\nIn 2024-25, the Atlanta Hawks won five or more consecutive games just once, capturing six in a row less than two months into the season. The team is on the verge of posting its second five-game winning streak already this campaign.The Hawks (24-25) aim for their fifth straight victory when they host the Houston Rockets (28-17) at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday at State Farm Arena. Atlanta, which won five in a row from Nov. 8-16, returns home one day after defeating the Celtics 117-106 in Boston.Houston also was in action Wednesday, losing 111-99 to the San Antonio Spurs at home. The Rockets are meeting the Hawks for the first time in 2025-26 after sweeping the two-game series between the teams last season.Seven other games are on Thursday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Miami Heat (25-23) and Chicago Bulls (23-24) at 8 p.m. ET at the United Center. It is the first of three consecutive contests between the clubs and first since Miami cruised to a 143-107 triumph at Chicago on Nov. 21. The Bulls won all three encounters with the Heat in 2024-25.There are a whopping 15 games on the NHL slate, one of which has the Washington Capitals (25-22-7) visiting Little Caesars Arena to face off against the Detroit Red Wings (32-17-5) at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Capitals have lost six of their last seven contests (1-5-1) and were swept in their home-and-home series against the Red Wings last month.A plethora of college basketball games take place Thursday, with one being a Big West Conference showdown pitting UC Davis (12-8) against host Cal State Northridge (11-10) at 10 p.m. ET at Premier America Credit Union Arena. The Aggies have won seven of their last 10 contests, with one of the victories being an 89-80 home triumph over the Matadors on Jan. 1.The Rockets are 3.5-point favorites against the Hawks in the latest consensus NBA odds, while the Heat are 1.5-point favorites versus the Bulls. The Red Wings are -122 on the money line against the Capitals and Cal State Northridge is a 2.5-point favorite versus UC Davis.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Thursday, Jan. 29. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchRockets at HawksTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Atlanta | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 223.5 (-109) | Expert: Amen Thompson Over 17.5 points (-112, PropBetGuy)Two of the Hawks' games during their current winning streak went Over the projected total for Thursday's contest, while their triumph over Boston yesterday saw 223 points scored. The Rockets are averaging 116.3 points this season but failed to reach that number in six of their last eight outings. Houston produced only 99 points in its loss to San Antonio on Wednesday, and the SportsLine Projection Model believes the team will break out in Atlanta and the Hawks will continue their scoring pace as the Over hits in well over 62% of its simulations. Amen Thompson scored 25 points on Wednesday, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (+1285 on his last 110 NBA player prop picks) feels the Rockets guard will come up with another strong effort and reach or exceed his season average of 18.3 points. \nHeat at BullsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Chicago | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 237.5 (-112) | Expert: Ayo Dosunmu Over 13.5 points (-114, Mike Barner)Both teams are in the top 10 in the NBA in scoring and the bottom 10 in points allowed. However, three of Chicago's last four games have finished Under the projected total for Thursday's matchup, and Miami is one day removed from a shootout against the Orlando Magic that saw 257 points scored, so the SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Heat are prime for a lower-scoring contest as its simulations have the Under hitting more than 61% of the time. Ayo Dosunmu is averaging 14.6 points this season but scored 20 and 19 in his last two outings, and SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner (18-7, +963 on his last 25 NBA player prop picks) believes the Bulls guard will continue to produce as he had 23 points against the Heat in their first meeting this season.NHL best bets, where to watchCapitals at Red WingsTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 6.5 (-107) | Expert: Red Wings -120 (Matt Severance)The Red Wings haven't been involved in many high-scoring games of late, as six or fewer goals were scored in seven of their last 10 contests. They've allowed more than three tallies just once in their past 11 outings, while the Capitals have recorded more than three goals in only one of their last nine games. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks goals will be at a premium in this matchup as the Under hits in 54% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance (23-11, +1096 on his last 34 NHL money line picks) likes Detroit to prevail since Washington has lost six of its last seven contests and is wrapping up a six-game road trip.CBB best bets, where to watchUC Davis at Cal State NorthridgeTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Northridge, Cal. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Cal State Northridge -2.5 (-105) | Expert: UC Davis +1.5 (-105, Zach Cimini)The Aggies are hot, having won seven of their last 10 games. The Matadors are not, as they've lost three of four. UC Davis posted a nine-point victory over Cal State Northridge at home at the beginning of the month, but the SportsLine Projection Model sees the Matadors earning a split of the season series as its simulations have them covering the spread 66% of the time. SportsLine expert Zach Cimini (+133 on his last 59 college basketball picks) disagrees, feeling that Cal State Northridge still could be feeling the effects from its trip to Hawaii last weekend. He likes UC Davis to cover.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're  one week out from the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. Who will get moved, and where, is very much top of mind around the league right now. For all the understandable lusting over Giannis Antetokounmpo now that the Bucks are reportedly listening to offers for their superstar, there are several other potential trade candidates who can be considered less valuable and far riskier. Sometimes not acquiring a certain player ends up being the wiser move.What follows is a group we'll call The Avoidables -- five players it would be smarter to steer clear of for various reasons. Buyer beware. 1. Anthony Davis, MavericksInitial reports had Davis undergoing hand surgery that would have shut him down for the remainder of the season. That was eventually walked back after Davis pushed back and voiced his displeasure on social media. Instead, after the Mavericks star consulted with a second specialist, it was announced that the big man would be reevaluated after six weeks. It was another brutal setback to add to AD's long list of health concerns over the years. The man has suffered an outrageous number of injuries in his career, so many that his nicknames include \"Street Clothes\" and \"Anthony Day-to-Day Davis.\" \nTough but fair. He's played just 20 games this season. Last year he played 51 games combined between his time with the Lakers and Mavs. The NBA's new(ish) criteria requires players to appear in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for awards. Davis has cleared that bar just three times in the last decade. No one doubts his talent. Just two seasons ago he made second-team All-NBA and first-team All-Defense. But that kind of output and availability has become the exception rather than the rule. Davis will also turn 33 in March and has two more years left on his current deal. He'll make $58.4 million next season, and he has a player option on the back end for a whopping $62.7 million when he'll be 35 years old before the contract finally expires. If he doesn't play again this season, Davis will have cleared $2.7 million per game. That's good work if you can get it -- but who would want to cut those checks moving forward?\n2. Ja Morant, GrizzliesThe Grizzlies finally arrived at the correct conclusion and are shopping Morant. What I suspect they have learned since putting him on the market is the cruel reality of supply-side economics when there's little demand. The Hawks traded Trae Young to the Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum's expiring contract and Corey Kispert. That kind of low-yield return should have greatly worried the Grizzlies front office. The NBA is loaded with high-usage ball-dominant guards. There just aren't a lot of teams that have a big hole in that area that needs filling. Even if a team wanted to upgrade at that position, it's difficult to make the case for Morant being the guy. The Raptors were reportedly interested in Morant early on but have since cooled on the idea. Hard to blame them. Like Davis, Morant has only been intermittently available. Morant suffered a UCL sprain and is expected to miss at least three weeks. He's played just 20 games this season. The last two seasons he played a combined 59 games. In seven NBA seasons, he's never played more than 67 games. \nJust as concerning, he hasn't progressed on the floor. If anything, he's regressed. For much of his career Morant has relied on his outsized athleticism. He's produced some breathtaking highlights. But those only get you so far. He's a good passer, but in a league that greatly values shooting, Morant has never added an outside element to his skillset. He's a career 31.1% 3-point shooter, and his 44.4 eFG% this season is by far the worst mark in his seven years in the league. Morant has two more years left on his contract for more than $87 million. He'll be 28 in the final year of the deal. That's a lot of money to commit to someone who doesn't shoot well and won't be able to rely on athleticism alone forever. 3. Zion Williamson, PelicansTo be clear, the Pelicans have signaled that they aren't looking to move Williamson. That's been the consistent line of thinking for multiple front offices in New Orleans, though it's fair to wonder why. Considering who precedes him on this list, it's kind of remarkable that Williamson might be the least reliable guy of the bunch. Yes he's played 33 games this season, which is three more than he played all of last year, but we'll see how many more he can add on. In seven years in the NBA, Zion has had three seasons where he played 30 or fewer games. And in the 2021-22 season, he didn't play at all due to injury. \nWilliamson has slimmed down, but he's still a big body that relies on strength and athleticism to make an impact. For someone who's so physical, he's a sneaky good passer (though his assist numbers this season are the lowest they've been since his second year in the league). But much like Morant, his game hasn't evolved during his time in the NBA. He's a 31.7 percent shooter from beyond the arc, on a total of 101 attempts for his entire career. That's not an element that he's worked on or even seems interested in adding. Almost as concerning, he gets to the line a ton. He's averaging just under eight attempts per game this season, but he's shooting 70 percent. That's not great and borders on a liability. Zion has two more years left on his contract and is owed more than $87 million. Eventually, the Pelicans should try to find someone to take Zion off their hands. In the meantime, nice of the New Orleans front office to save the rest of the league from making a mistake. 4. LaMelo Ball, HornetsAt some point the suddenly surging Hornets are going to look around and realize that they have two quality young players to build around and Ball isn't one of them. The future belongs to Kon Knueppel and Brandon Miller. Which doesn't mean that anyone should be rushing out to pry LaMelo away from Charlotte. \nLike everyone else listed so far, Ball has availability issues. He's played 38 games this season. But in four of his other five professional seasons he played 51 or fewer. He's averaging19 points on close to 16.5 shots, his worst production since his rookie year. He's also playing just over 27 minutes per game, the least he's played in his career. And check out what Hornets head coach Charles Lee said about him after a recent loss to the Cavs: \"For the most part, he continued to try to play through it and not let his shot-making, or shot-missing, dictate the energy he was gonna give to the game.\" Talk about damning with faint praise. 5. Zach LaVine, KingsYou could make a case to avoid so many of the potential Kings trade candidates, but LaVine is probably first among them. He's having his worst season in a while. LaVine has always been a volume scorer, but he's averaging fewer than 20 points and shooting under 50% -- a marked drop off from last season. \nSure it's a wonky fit in Sacramento due to poor roster construction, but his usage rate is roughly the same this season as it was when the Kings traded for him last year. When he's not launching and scoring in bunches, he's hardly contributing. His rebounds and assists per game are the lowest they've been since his second season in the NBA when he was 20 years old, and on the defensive end he's far from useful. LaVine will be 31 in March. Like the rest of The Avoidables, he has a dodgy injury history. He played 74 games last season, but just 25 the season before. In six of his first 11 seasons, he played fewer than 65 games. And that contract that made it so tough for the Bulls to find a taker for him until the Kings came along and bailed them out last season still has one more year left. LaVine has a player option for next season at nearly $49 million. Hard to imagine many teams knocking down the Kings door for the chance to pay him that much. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in nearly two decades, the Baltimore Ravens have a new head coach. Jesse Minter was introduced as the man in charge in Baltimore Thursday, one week after the team officially hired him to replace John Harbaugh. Minter, 42, comes from the Los Angeles Chargers, where he was the defensive coordinator under Jim Harbaugh. Of course, it was John -- the other Harbaugh brother -- who had been coaching the Ravens for the last 18 years. Minter in Baltimore on John Harbaugh's staff from 2017-20, rising from defensive assistant to defensive backs coach.Minter interviewed for several head-coaching jobs, but his time in Baltimore helped push him to return, he said.\"When this job opened, this became the one for me, and this was the one that I wanted,\" Minter said. \"I did go through the initial process with a lot of different teams, but as I was able to reconnect with people in this organization, and knowing the history, knowing the tradition, knowing the spine of the organization, kind of what it's built on, there was no better place for me.\"\nHere are three takeaways from Minter's introductory press conference.Minter: Lamar Jackson the 'best' player in the NFLMinter faced Lamar Jackson once as the Chargers' defensive coordinator -- in Week 12 in 2024 -- and got a taste of what makes him so special. Jackson, Baltimore's starting quarterback for the past eight seasons, threw for two touchdowns and ran for another as the Ravens rallied for a 30-23 victory.Now that he's coaching Jackson rather than coaching against him, Minter said he's already had \"multiple conversations\" with the two-time MVP and is looking forward to more.\"With Lamar, I just look forward to connecting with him, helping him become the best version of himself, creating a team identity that allows him to thrive -- which he's already proven to be an elite, elite, one of the best .. the best player in the National Football League -- and put a team around him that allows him to reach that ultimate goal of bringing a Super Bowl back to Baltimore,\" Minter said.\n\n        \n            \n                Grading every offensive and defensive coordinator hire: Chargers hit home run, Lions and Commanders take risks\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson, who turned 29 three days after a season-ending Week 18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, played in just 13 games in 2025. He missed three games with a hamstring injury and another with a back contusion as he dealt with several nagging issues throughout the season. His rushing numbers were down to career lows as a starter, too, and he had one of the NFL's highest sack rates. However, he still showed moments of brilliance and led the NFL with 13.3 yards per completion.Talked to John Harbaugh about the openingGiven his connection to both Harbaugh brothers and the fact that he was moving from coaching under one to succeeding the other, Minter talked with John Harbaugh and got some positive feedback.\"Yes, I've talked to Coach a couple times,\" Minter said. \"Tons of respect for John. The 18 years here, the wonderful success, a Super Bowl, probably in the Ring of Honor one day. ... We've had just a couple of small conversations. He knows how I feel about this place. He did text me, 'I think they should hire you.' That was just one of the texts he sent, so I appreciated that. But I love John.\"\nHe also got some advice.\"Really just take the foundation in place and build on it, make it better, put my own spin on it and not try to be John Harbaugh, not try to be Jim Harbaugh, be myself, connect with everybody, make it about all of us, and I really look forward to doing that,\" Minter said.Minter plans to call defensive plays, maximize Kyle HamiltonMinter said he will call the defense, calling it \"a strength of mine.\" Though not as numerous as offensive play-calling head coaches, defensive play callers in head-coaching roles do exist; Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald calls the defensive plays and has his team in the Super Bowl, for instance.\"I have a really good process, I feel, to do what I need to do to be ready to call the game, but I also have the ability to be the head coach and to impact the entire roster -- the entire team -- and make sure that it's our offense, our defense, our special teams, and that there's no divide there,\" Minter said.\nOne of the advantages Minter will have when calling plays is Kyle Hamilton. With three All-Pro selections in four years, Hamilton is one of the NFL's premier safeties, but Minter views him more as \"a weapon.\"\"He is a positionless defensive player that I would classify as a weapon on defense,\" Minter said. \"As much as you can do to get a guy like Kyle near the point of attack, I think, is what you try to do as a designer, play caller. I could not be more thrilled to be able to work with Kyle.\"\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL season's 25 biggest stories: Shedeur Sanders, Sam Darnold, stunning firings headline wild ride\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMinter helped Chargers safety Derwin James have two of the best seasons of his NFL career. James had career highs in sacks (5.5) and tackles for loss (10) in 2024 and was a second-team All-Pro selection both years under Minter.\nMinter's work in Los Angeles surely appealed to a Baltimore team in need of more defensive discipline and playmaking, too. This season, the Chargers defense was in the top 10 in takeaways (23), sacks (45) and plays of 20-plus yards allowed (44). The Ravens finished tied for 15th, tied for 28th and 31st in those respective categories.\"I think about defense a certain way,\" Minter said. \"[The players will] learn how I think about it and how I feel about it. I think there's a fundamental level needed, required to play great defense that we will harp on tremendously, and so I look forward to getting with the guys [for] them to kind of learn my thoughts on how you play great defense.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles have found their new offensive coordinator as the team announced the hire of Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach Sean Mannion on Thursday. Mannion, 33, replaces Kevin Patullo, who was removed from the position after Philadelphia's wild card loss to the San Francisco 49ers earlier this month. Patullo, a longtime assistant of Eagles coach Nick Sirianni, served in the role for just one season. Mannion, who spent nine seasons in the NFL as a backup quarterback and has just two seasons of coaching experience, is set to inherit a unit that took a major step back on the heels of winning Super Bowl LIX.\"I'm thrilled to have Sean Mannion on board as the new offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles,\" Sirianni said. \"I felt it was important to be patient and thorough to allow the right fit to reveal himself to us. Sean did just that. It was quickly apparent in meeting with Sean that he is a bright young coach with a tremendous future ahead of him in this league.\"The Eagles went 11-6 but finished the regular season ranked 24th in yards per game, 19th in yards per play and 21st in offensive points per game this season. It was a trying campaign for all involved with receiver A.J. Brown calling the situation a \"s--- show,\" fellow receiver DeVonta Smith voicing his own frustration with the passing offense, running back Saquon Barkley regressing a league-leading 2,283 yards from scrimmage in 2024 to 1,413 in 2025, and quarterback Jalen Hurts being plagued by inconsistent play.\n        \n            \n                Grading every offensive and defensive coordinator hire: Chargers hit home run, Lions and Commanders take risks\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA former Oregon State star, Mannion was selected by the then-St. Louis Rams in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft. He appeared in 10 games (one start) with the Rams and played in four games (two starts) with the Minnesota Vikings from 2019-21. He spent time with the Seattle Seahawks as recently as 2023 before embarking on a coaching career.\nAmong the notable offensive minds Mannion played for include Rams coach Sean McVay, Packers coach Matt LaFleur and Atlanta Falcons coach Kevin Stefanski. Mannion retired as a player in early 2024 and joined LaFleur's Packers as an offensive assistant. A year later, he was elevated to quarterbacks coach. Under his tutelage this season, Jordan Love had arguably the best year of his career, and backup Malik Willis stepped in and played well in multiple instances when Love was hurt.Mannion is the Eagles' fifth offensive coordinator in five years. The team lost Shane Steichen to the Indianapolis Colts coaching job after the 2022 season and handed the reins to Brian Johnson in 2023. The offense struggled, though, and Kellen Moore replaced Johnson the following season. After directing a Super Bowl-winning offense, Moore got the New Orleans Saints coaching job, leading to Patullo's promotion. Now Sirianni is handing the reins over to Mannion.LaFleur said Mannion has a \"bright future in this profession\" earlier this month. Philadelphia clearly agreed.\n\"I was impressed by his systematic views on offensive football and his strategic approach,\" Sirianni said. \"Sean's 11 years in the NFL have provided him a great opportunity to learn from and grow alongside some of the best coaches in the game. As a result, he has a wealth of knowledge and experience that will be invaluable to our team moving forward.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        An eyebrow-raising comment from Buffalo Bills owner Terry Pegula brought uncertainty to wide receiver Keon Coleman's future with the franchise. But after offensive coordinator Joe Brady was promoted to head coach on Tuesday, Coleman's outlook in Buffalo looks a bit brighter. Brady on Thursday backed Coleman and made an emphatic statement on his status for 2026, proclaiming that the receiver \"is going to be on our football team.\"After the Bills fired coach Sean McDermott, Pegula threw the coaching staff under the bus in response to a question about Coleman's disappointing performance through two seasons. Pegula defended general manager Brandon Beane for drafting Coleman, saying that he would not have made that selection with the No. 33 pick in 2024 if not for the coaching staff's insistence that he do so.Brady on Thursday made it known that he was part of the movement to draft Coleman and that he remains high on the Florida State product as he enters his third year in Buffalo.\"I told Keon when I got hired, the best thing to happen to Keon Coleman was me being his head coach,\" Brady said in a side session with the media after his introductory press conference (via Syracuse.com). \"I was one of the ones who stood on the table for Keon Coleman, and I believe in Keon Coleman. Keon Coleman is going to be a Buffalo Bill.\"\n        \n            \n                Josh Allen injury: Bills QB reveals he played end of regular season, playoffs with broken foot\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nColeman was in and out of the starting lineup in 2025 after establishing himself as a mainstay as a rookie. He caught 38 passes for 404 yards and four touchdowns as he struggled to improve upon his rookie production. He also caught just two passes in the Bills' two playoff games, albeit with one going for a touchdown.\n\"It was a learning year for Keon,\" Brady said. \"I know it's something that not everybody wants to go through, but we had to put the team first in a lot of the elements. He's going to continue to grow. The elements that we saw in the draft process, the confidence that I have in him and his ability, as long as he's handling what he needs to do off the field, I have no doubt that he's going to be successful on the field.\"Coleman has two years left on his rookie contract. While Pegula intimated that the front office is not fully bought into him, elevating Brady to the head coach role could be the difference between dealing him to another team and keeping him around for what the team hopes will be a breakthrough season.Quarterback Josh Allen expressed confidence that Coleman will not only return to Buffalo in 2026 but that he will also bounce back from the awkward comments from team ownership.\n\"He will come back from that,\" Allen said. \"I'm not going to give up on 0. He's got too much ability. I will not give up on him. We're going to work tirelessly, him and me, as well as everybody else in the building, to make sure that whenever we step foot on the field that we're going to find ways to win football games. He's going to be a part of that.\"\n            ",

Winning matters, and it will get you on the move up this board form week to week.

Detroit doesn't have much else to turn to besides Cade's creation, and the 3-point shooting (20th in percentage, 27th in makes per game) is a problem. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            34-12\n                        \n                                4\n                            \n                                    Nuggets\n                                \n                            Jamal Murray got fouled on 3-point shots twice inside the four seconds on Monday, but each time was unable to convert all three free throws with a chance to tie the game as Denver fell for just the third time in its last nine.

    "body": "\n        Marcus Semien scanned the bar area inside the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego late one evening during the MLB Winter Meetings. The year was 2019, and Semien, still a member of the Oakland Athletics, had just completed a breakout season, one that helped propel him into the league's elite. Yet at this moment he wasn't too enamored with his newfound accolades, nor the adulation. In his mind, there was another star on the horizon. He glanced to his left, then peered out over a sea of baseball executives who claim that bar space each December until he found his person. \"This,\" he said to one reporter situated in the same vicinity. \"This is who you have to meet.\" \nIt was Paul Toboni -- long before he claimed the role as the Nationals president of baseball operations at 35.At the time, Toboni had just been promoted to director of amateur scouting for the Red Sox. He was only 29. Around the game, he was viewed as a rising star. The kind who would run his own team one day.He had a feel for people. Easy to talk to. Charismatic. Toboni played the game, too. He and Semien were teammates at Cal. He had a scouting background and an understanding for analytics. \nSemien understood he wasn't the only future star in the room. \"I watched him as a teammate, a baseball teammate in college, how he worked, whether it was in the weight room or at practice or just his effort on the field,\" Semien, now with the Mets, told CBS Sports via a phone call earlier this month. \"When you play with somebody and you see them doing the hardest thing we're ever going to do, playing the sport, and then he goes into the business world, I knew he was going to do just fine.\" Semien wasn't taking a guess. He recognized a peer for his baseball acumen and ability to scout talent. Toboni snatched up Roman Anthony for the Red Sox in the second round of the 2022 MLB Draft. Anthony was the top prospect in baseball before debuting in 2025 and looks bound for stardom.\nA year later, he grabbed Kristian Campbell in the fourth round. He was a compensation pick after Xander Bogaerts chose the Padres in free agency. Campbell has had his struggles, but the Sox still view him as a linchpin to their future.Toboni survived three heads of baseball operations -- Dave Dombrowski, Chaim Bloom and Craig Breslow -- during his time in Boston. It never broke his stride. Toboni kept climbing, eventually reaching the level of assistant general manager with the Sox.Now, Toboni is running his own club. The Nationals handed him the keys as they try to claw back relevance in the National League East.\n\"I'm bringing over what I learned in Boston and trying to move us forward,\" Toboni said. \"Early on, you're drinking from a fire hose.\"As endearing and engaging as Toboni can be, there's a harder edge underneath.\"I think he has the right balance of remaining rigidly anchored to his beliefs while showing the empathy and humility to bring others along and to admit when he's wrong,\" Breslow said.He wasted little time reshaping the front office in D.C., making sweeping changes shortly after arriving. He hired Blake Butera as manager in October. The 33-year-old is MLB's youngest skipper in more than 50 years. Last week, he made his first big player move: trading MacKenzie Gore, the Nats' best starter in 2025, to the Rangers. Shortstop CJ Abrams could be next. \nThose around the Red Sox describe Toboni as unwavering. Once he commits to a direction, he doesn't flinch. That approach didn't always sit well with older ways of thinking in Boston. Toboni pushed process. Numbers. Alignment. Data. He played a role in the Red Sox' push toward Driveline Baseball, helping reshape how certain departments operated and where decision-making lived. His scouting background evolved. Less gut. More metrics. Sometimes more spreadsheets than stadium seats.His playing background mattered. It just didn't dictate the process.\"We have to stay open minded and adapt as the game changes. Having said that, you know, it's still, still something that I really value,\" Toboni said of his playing days. \"I think I just deploy it differently than I did as an area scout.\" Toboni starts with the metrics. The model. The valuation. Then he goes hunting for what the model might not show. \n\"When you see a valuation on a player, you're like, OK, what might the model be missing?\" Toboni said. \"Your ability to poke holes in a model valuation lends back to how I was trained as an evaluator.\"The love for the game, however, has been enduring.Semien remembers going to Giants games with Toboni while the two were in college, how he already knew the ins and outs of every player on the field. He was immersed.That carried over on the field, too. Toboni was a preferred walk-on at Cal, appearing in just 24 games combined in 2011 and 2012. The at-bats were limited. The approach never was.\nThat team wasn't supposed to last. The program was supposed to be cut by the university during the time Toboni and Semien were there. Instead, Cal Baseball was saved, thanks to donors and a surprise run to the 2011 College World Series.\"He was impactful, regardless of how much he played,\" said his former college coach David Esquer, now the head coach at Stanford.Paul Toboni, No. 30, wasn't the star of Cal's College World Series team in 2011, but 'he was impactful.' \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Toboni is now looking for something else to save in Washington. A team seemingly so far removed from the glory days of 2019 when they lifted their first World Series banner with the likes of Max Scherzer and a 20-year-old Juan Soto. \nToboni, his wife, Danielle, and their four children have settled into one of Washington's older, quieter neighborhoods. Life is still in motion. Boxes unpacked slowly. The work in the front office, though? Moving fast.Toboni standing on his own now, at the top. He's no longer just an amateur scouting director in a bar at the Manchester Grand Hyatt.He's someone you need to know.\n            ",

Whether due to injury, poor play or just hoping for a change of scenery, these are guys we expect to get better next year.  Three excellent selections from Heath Cummings were Lamar Jackson, Justin Jefferson and Terry McLaurin. And, as you'll hear in the show, Adam Aizer expects three offenses that struggled in 2025 to get better in 2026 with Philadelphia, Tampa Bay and the Chargers. I'll cover my guys here with a bonus in Brock Bowers. As of now, these are all players I plan to target in 2026. BOUNCEBACK CANDIDATES Jayden Daniels In 2024, Daniels was the No. 5 Fantasy quarterback as a rookie at 23.9 points per game. His Average Draft Position in 2025 was the No. 4 quarterback, but he struggled with injuries and was limited to just seven games. He also averaged only 18.6 Fantasy points per game. But he averaged 22.4 Fantasy points in his first five outings, and it's easy to see him getting back to a high level in 2026 if he can stay healthy. He passed for 3,568 yards, 25 touchdowns, and nine interceptions in 2024, along with 891 rushing yards and six touchdowns. His rushing potential is elite, and the Commanders will hopefully add some talent in the passing game, especially since Deebo Samuel and Zach Ertz are pending free agents. I like Daniels as a top-five Fantasy quarterback in 2026.  Justin Herbert Herbert had a solid season in 2025 at 21.8 Fantasy points per game, but I'm hoping he'll get back to the level of production he had in the first two years of his career when he averaged at least 26.3 Fantasy points per game over that span. For starters, getting tackles Rashawn Slater (knee), who missed the entire season, and Joe Alt (ankle), who was limited to six games, back healthy for a full year will be huge. With Alt healthy, Herbert averaged 25.1 Fantasy points per game in 2025. Along with a healthy offensive line, Herbert should benefit with the addition of new offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel, who helped Tua Tagovailoa lead the NFL in passing yards in 2023. This could be a huge season for Herbert in 2026, and he has top-five upside if things go right.  Kenneth Walker III We'll see how Walker finishes the 2025 campaign since he's playing against New England in Super Bowl LX. But things are looking up for Walker in 2026 if he decides to return to Seattle. Zach Charbonnet (ACL) was injured in the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs against San Francisco, and it's doubtful he'll be ready for the start of next season. Including the game against the 49ers, Walker played nearly three full games without Charbonnet in 2025 and averaged 24.9 Fantasy points over that span. Walker is a free agent this offseason, so we'll see where he plays in 2026, but I'm hopeful he returns to the Seahawks. He could be worth drafting as early as Round 2 in the majority of leagues, depending on how much time Charbonnet might miss next year.  Bucky Irving In the first four games of the 2025 season, when Irving was healthy, he looked like a star when he averaged 18 PPR points per game. He then missed seven games due to injury, and he struggled down the stretch by scoring 10.8 PPR points or less in each of his final four outings. Tampa Bay changed offensive coordinators this offseason, with Zac Robinson taking over, and he was just the play-caller in Atlanta with Bijan Robinson, which is a plus for Irving. Rachaad White is also an unrestricted free agent and isn't expected to return, and Sean Tucker is a restricted free agent. Most likely, Irving will share touches with Tucker, but I still have high hopes for Irving in 2026. Along with what he did to start 2025, he also closed the 2024 campaign by scoring at least 16.3 PPR points in seven of his final nine games. Depending on what happens this offseason, I plan to draft Irving no later than Round 3 in the majority of leagues.  Breece Hall I thought Hall would struggle in 2025, and he averaged a career-low 13.1 PPR points per game. He had respectable stats with 243 carries for 1,065 yards and four touchdowns and 36 catches for 350 yards and a touchdown on 48 targets, but we know he's capable of more. He averaged at least 15.1 PPR points per game in the first three seasons of his career, and I can see him getting back to that level of production -- or better -- in 2026. He's a free agent this offseason, but Jets general manager Darren Mougey has already said the team would like to retain Hall, whether that's on a new deal or the franchise tag. Ideally, he would leave the Jets and join a better offense, especially with an established quarterback, and then we can see just how good Hall really is in a better environment. But if he remains with the Jets, he can still be a standout Fantasy option, and hopefully the team keeps building on offense for 2026. I'm willing to draft Hall as early as Round 3 in the majority of leagues.  CeeDee Lamb Lamb had the worst Fantasy season of his career since his rookie campaign when he averaged just 14.4 PPR points per game in 2025. In 14 games, he had 75 catches for 1,077 yards and three touchdowns on 117 targets. Lamb was overshadowed by George Pickens, who led Dallas with 93 catches for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns on 137 targets, and he averaged 17.2 PPR points per game. The easiest path for Lamb to rebound is if Pickens leaves the Cowboys since he's a free agent, and then Lamb would be a top-three Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. But I still value Lamb as a top-five Fantasy receiver even if Pickens returns. Dak Prescott still favors Lamb, who averaged at least 17.7 PPR points per game in each of the two previous seasons prior to 2025. That's the level of production I'm expecting for Lamb, and he should be a first-round pick in all formats in 2026.  A.J. Brown Brown had a down season in 2025 when he averaged just 15.1 PPR points per game, which was his lowest total since joining the Eagles in 2022. But it wasn't as bad as you might think. From Weeks 12-17, which includes the Fantasy playoffs, Brown averaged 19.8 PPR points per game, which is standout production. He had four games with at least 10 targets over that span, and he was back to being the alpha of the passing game. The Eagles just hired Sean Mannion to be their new offensive coordinator, and hopefully that will make Brown happy. We don't know if Philadelphia plans to trade Brown, although that seems unlikely given his contract. I'm still planning to draft Brown as a borderline No. 1 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues if he stays with the Eagles, and I'll target him as early as Round 3.\nLadd McConkey McConkey, along with Herbert, should benefit with the addition of McDaniel as the offensive coordinator, especially if Keenan Allen leaves as a free agent. McConkey just had a terrible season in 2025 at 11.7 PPR points per game, which was a huge drop-off from his 2024 production when he averaged 15.1 PPR points. But in 2025, McConkey had 11 games with at least six targets, and he averaged 14.2 PPR points per game over that span. McConkey should be the No. 1 receiver for McDaniel, who helped Tyreek Hill have consecutive seasons with at least 119 catches, 1,710 yards, seven touchdowns and 170 targets in Miami in 2022-23. McConkey won't do that, and he'll compete for targets with Quentin Johnston, Tre Harris and Oronde Gadsden II even if Allen is gone. But I'm excited for McConkey entering his third season in the NFL, and I would draft him as early as Round 3.  Brock Bowers Bowers was the No. 2 PPR tight end last season at 14.7 points per game, but he was far behind Trey McBride, who averaged 18.6. Bowers missed five games due to a knee injury, but he played hurt for three games after initially getting injured in Week 1. He missed three games after that and returned in Week 9 against Jacksonville and scored 43.3 PPR points. He has the potential to produce like McBride, if not better, but we still have questions for Bowers in 2026. We know he'll have a new quarterback (likely Indiana's Fernando Mendoza with the No. 1 overall pick) and a new head coach, and both of those guys should feature Bowers in 2026. I'm excited to see what happens in Las Vegas this offseason, and Bowers is worth drafting toward the end of Round 2 or beginning of Round 3 in all leagues.  Sam LaPorta LaPorta missed the final eight games of the season in 2025 with a back injury, but he's expected to be fine for the start of 2026. And I like the addition of new offensive coordinator Drew Petzing for LaPorta. Petzing was on Cleveland's offensive staff from 2020-22 (tight ends coach and quarterbacks coach), and the Browns tight ends had a target share of at least 26.2 percent over that span, with Austin Hooper twice being second on the team in targets. Then, Petzing went to Arizona as the offensive coordinator from 2023-25, and McBride led the Cardinals in targets for three years in a row. Arizona tight ends also had a target share of at least 32.4 percent in all three seasons. LaPorta averaged 14.1 PPR points per game as a rookie in 2023 and scored at least 13.3 PPR points in six of his final seven outings in 2024. He only averaged 11.9 PPR points per game in 2025 before getting hurt, but I plan to draft him as a top-seven Fantasy tight end with a mid-round pick in all leagues in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        With NWSL preseason in full swing, a slew of comeback player story arcs are unfolding ahead of the new campaign. For Angel City defender Savy King, her return to the pitch follows a very scary, public moment that kept her on the sidelines for months and thankfully was not worse -- a cardiac episode on May 9 of last year that required immediate medical attention in the middle of a regular-season NWSL game. The 20-year-old defender had suffered a form of heart attack due to a rare congenital heart abnormality she was born with, an anomalous left coronary artery. The condition shifts the heart's most critical blood vessel to a slightly different location than normal, disrupting blood flow. Now, nearly nine months later, King is back in preseason camps after recovering from the medical emergency, which required, in the moment, life-saving care and surgery. In a very frightening moment in front of a stadium full of fans, teammates, colleagues, and viewers tuning in to watch a game, King has used the time away to navigate her recovery with openness and transparency. \"I think that it's definitely been something that I've kind of had to adjust to,\" King said about managing a life-altering moment at a young age. \n\"The first question I asked once I knew what happened to me was, if am I going to be able to play soccer again. Looking at it, being 20 years old, I still have a lot of career ahead of me and a lot that I still want to accomplish. So, in my head, unless [doctors] told me you're not gonna be able to play again, there was nothing that was gonna stop me from getting back out there onto the field. And I think it's important for people to see that. Maybe people don't have injuries that are similar, per se, but any injury in general, to just see that you can come back and you can be stronger, and you can go through something like that, and it's your approach is what matters the most.\"\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Stepping back into routineIn the weeks following a successful surgery and receiving a positive prognosis at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, King was trying to embrace the long road ahead while balancing the public interest and concern.\"I was very particular in what, at least at first, of what I put out there. I feel like the way that I kind of knew going into it, that there was going to be a lot of questions, and it was just kind of me navigating how I wanted to answer the questions. I wasn't sharing everything that was going on, but at least the important things that made people feel comfortable enough to feel okay with how I was doing, if that makes sense. Because for me, it felt wrong to not let people know because it was so public and so many people were affected by it, that I just didn't want to completely disappear and then one day be like, 'Oh, I'm fine,'\" she expanded.\n\"I wanted people to see the journey and progress and all of that. And as time went on, I felt more comfortable in sharing more, because I felt like that was helping people the most, the more people knew about what was going on. So I've kind of tried to figure out the best way to answer certain questions. But I feel like vulnerability is the best thing to be when it's such a public event that happened.\"King was surrounded by a wave of support by teammates and fans, and she credits her sports psychologist as an added resource of recovery as well. Through every step, her parents, Karrie King and Kim Parker King, have been by her side, though the player acknowledges that the experiences have had highs and lows for everyone. But just having time together as a family has been key just getting back to a sense of normalcy, by even just attending soccer games as fans together.\"I feel like, for a long time, it felt kind of crazy with everything going on, and there was just a lot of publicity with it and everything. But as we've gotten closer to me being back on the field, I feel like it's kind of settled down a lot, and I've settled down a lot. My parents would never admit this, but I know that it's been really hard for them, and it's a very sensitive subject for them, for sure,\" she said.\n\"I let them know that I'm doing okay as well, and I feel like they've been able to calm down a lot, even though they haven't shown it. But I can't imagine that it's been anywhere close to easy for them. So yeah, I think that as time has gone on, it's definitely felt more normal, especially just being a person again, which is cool.\"King has made a conscious choice to be open about her experience when she could've taken the opposite approach and kept things private. The vulnerability has become a part of her journey, and she's bravely opting to go through it, instead of avoiding it or going around it.\"Sometimes people don't feel comfortable being vulnerable. And I feel like I've been vulnerable on a very public scale, because I think that that's so important for people to see that side of it, too. Because sometimes you get like, sometimes athletes, I feel like you're seen as robots, like we're not human. And I wanted to show the personal side of it too, so people could really see everything that I was going through as well, and that it's normal to have ups and downs, not everything is just going to be linear,\" she said.\n\"It's just about who you feel comfortable enough to open up to, but it's so important to do that, and I feel like that is important for people to know when going through injuries, that you don't have to go through it all alone, because that doesn't make you a stronger person. I feel like it makes the whole entire process a lot easier.\"Being Savy againAfter a lengthy time away to recover from surgery, Savy King is back with Angel City in the preseason. Though she's still listed with a season-ending injury designation and still must have medical clearance for game action, her arrival ahead of the regular season marks a massive personal milestone.\"To be honest, I think that I've tried to approach it with the most grace that I can and just know that everything happens for a reason, and that I was in the right hands at the right time, and that there's a lot more to look forward to, and I just didn't want that to be something that defined me,\" King said about her return.\n\"I can't wait for it to just be Savy, the soccer player again. That's why it's so important for me, and getting back out there on the field, because I miss that, instead of it just constantly being [about] what happened to me. I can't wait to change the narrative for that and continue to accomplish everything. But I think just having that perspective in my mind, that there's so much coming for me in the future, that there's no point in dwelling on everything that happened.\"The decision to continue the match following the emergency was met with fierce vocal opposition from players across the league, including Washington Spirit national team forward Trinity Rodman, who posted on her Instagram stories, sending prayers and adding, \"In no world should that game have continued.\"King's return is significant for Angel City, as the club felt her absence on both emotional and tactical levels. While King's medical emergency occurred earlier in the season, she had started all eight matches prior to her collapse, forming a promising presence on the club's backline. \nFor now, it will be just about taking small, important steps toward playing professionally again while using her experience to make a difference and grow on a personal level.\"I just tried to handle it the best way possible, just so people could see that anything is possible if you're resilient and you're hardworking. I've worked so hard to get back out there on the field, and it's only been eight months since my surgery, and I'm already back fully in training, which is awesome to look at. But yeah, I think that every step of the way, I've definitely gone through ups and downs, for sure, it's part of the process as well, and learning myself too,\" she said. \"I feel like I've matured and grown a lot through this, and so really proud of the way that I've handled everything, looking back at it.\"Savy King of Hearts foundationWith the extended time away and the attention the King family received following the event, there were discussions on how they could make an impact on others. The family and medical surgeons credit the first responders who administered life-saving care, including chest compressions and the use of an automated external defibrillator during King's cardiac event.\n\"The amount of people that came up to me and talked about how they were affected by [it] either personally or indirectly, by someone that had a cardiac event that happened to them ... It's not something that I was necessarily aware of before this all happened to me. The amount of messages that I've had, the amount of kids that have their parents reached out, or they themselves reached out, and talking about how they went through something similar, and how they were going through open heart surgery, was like, Wow, this is something that is really more common than what we think,\" she said. The family ultimately settled on developing a non-profit to connect and raise awareness of the importance of quick responses to cardiac events. \"I remember talking to my family and being like, we definitely need to try and do something with it, because I have the ability to,\" she said. \"It was so public, like, there's a platform behind it. There's a lot of people that want to know these things, and that were so interested in knowing what happened to me and how I was dealing with it. So we were trying to figure out the best way to go about it, and we thought a nonprofit was the best way to kind of spread awareness to the message that I wanted out there, which was to learn CPR, learn about cardiac events, and then hopefully everyone kind of knows.\"\nThe foundation is connecting more families through community events with the American Heart Association. King's long-term goal is to expand her foundation beyond California and have an impact nationwide. \"Every donation that we get goes towards putting AEDs in communities that don't have them. So we're doing our best to put on events. I had a camp where the American Heart Association came out there, and all the little girls learned CPR, and so did their parents. Going back and sharing my story, or having events where I partner with the American Heart Association, or whoever it is, to help bring people together to learn CPR is the main goal eventually,\" she explained.Creating the nonprofit also became a source of comfort and catharsis for King while she was away from the pitch. Taking the time to connect with other individuals and families whose lives have changed through cardiac episodes.\n\"It's awesome to see how much that has affected people and how much it means to people. That has been the biggest drive for me to keep going and try to figure it out. It's got a lot bigger, really fast. So it's been a lot for us to kind of manage. It grew faster than what we ever imagined,\" she said. \"But it's really cool to just get messages through the email and see how much it means to people. How people went through the same things, and that them seeing me helps them in their recovery as well. But it's vice versa, too. For me to know that I'm not the only one that's going through that as well, it's awesome to have other people that I can relate to.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        What a day, what a day. A topsy-turvy Champions League league phase wrapped up in epic fashion, as 61 goals were scored, teams went back and forth to push for winners, and we even got a goal from a goalkeeper. Matchday 8 had something for everyone, and while we'll mourn the loss of the Americans who won't be making it to the knockouts as well as Antonio Conte's Napoli and Roberto De Zerbi's Marseille, this was an ending for the ages, so let's take a look at some winners and losers from the final day of the league phase:Winner: Jose MourinhoFrom being confronted by Benfica supporters during the weekend because of them not being happy with the team's results lately, to taking down Real Madrid to push for an unlikely knockout stage berth. When Mourinho took over Benfica, they had already dropped two matches in the league phase, and it would take two more Champions League matches for Benfica to pick up their first points. They won three of their last four matches, but even then, it took a stoppage-time goal from keeper Anatoliy Trubin to make it happen. Not only is he the fifth keeper to score a goal in UCL play, but Mourinho didn't even realize that it was needed after going ahead 3-2 when chaos was ensuing. \"When I made the last changes, [Franjo] Ivanovic and Antonio Silva, I was told [that] is enough, so let's close the door. When I made the changes a few seconds later, they tell me we need one more goal, but I cannot make more changes, so that was the lucky point to get a free kick that allows us to go there with the big guy,\" Jose Mourinho said after the game. What a night under the lights in Europe.\"It's a wild moment in a game that had a bit of everything, and while it was a poor loss for Real Madrid, Champions League play always needs more Mourinho, and that's just what we're getting. \nLosers: NapoliWhile on one hand, you'd like to put Conte here, the Italian manager has been excellent at making it out of chaos unscathed. I mean, the man went from floundering at Tottenham to winning a Scudetto at Napoli. But they were unable to get the win they needed over Chelsea to move to the knockout stage. It has been the story of Napoli's season where they're so close to competing while also being so far from where they need to be. Some of this can be chalked up to not having a healthy Romelu Lukaku, who Conte was able to get a lot out of last season, but they're now nine points off Inter's pace for the Scudetto. It's hard to win a league title bin back to back campaigns, but a loss could see Napoli slip all the way to sixth behind Como. They are in the Coppa Italia for a chance at silverware this season but even that won't be enough to call the campaign a success. Watch out for the next poor result that Napoli have, because that could be when we get the biennial event of Conte walking away from a club.Winner: The league phase format\"This is unbelievable. Wow. We might never get another moment like this,\" CBS Sports Golazo analyst Jamie Carragher said after the matches wrapped with Benfica's crazy goal. And he's right.Genuinely, I can't count the number of changes that happened with teams shuffling during the final stages of the day. Three new teams, Bodo/Glimt, Club Brugge, and Benfica, all got into the top 24 on the final day of play, and half of the teams in the top eight also shifted. The new Champions League format has not only meant that there's drama for the final day, but it has also given the smaller sides around the world better chances to make it to the knockouts, which can lead to tremendous amounts of money to help these clubs come back and do it all again. Take Bodo/Glimt for example, last season they made a European knockout for the first time ever in Europa Leauge and now here they are taking out Manchester City and Atletico Madrid in Champions League play to one up themselves. While there are valid questions of whether the richest clubs are getting too far ahead of the pack -- and we'll get to those -- it's clear that this tournament does mean something to the bigger teams in smaller leagues. And with teams in some of the larger leagues around the world faltering, this could mean something for the UEFA club coefficients that determine how many clubs get into each European competition and who gets automatic qualification without needing to go through the playoffs. More of this, please.\nLosers: The Champions League contingent of the AmericansEight Americans made appearances in the league phase of the Champions League: Sergino Dest, Malik Tillman, Weston McKennie, Folarin Balogun, Yunus Musah, Johnny Cardoso, Ricardo Pepi, and Marvin Dills. But only four remain in the knockouts, with none gaining automatic berths to the round of 16. Tillman's Bayer Leverkusen, Cardoso's Atletico Madrid, McKennie's Juventus, and Balogun's Monaco will all keep moving on. 18-year-old Dills just made his Champions League debut for Eintracht Frankfurt on the final day of action against Tottenham; the others were heavily involved for their teams. While it's not their fault that they got knocked out, it is unfortunate that the contingent is halved in one day when it seemed like all of them could survive into the next round. Given how the bracket looks for the knockout phase, this is a number that could drop drastically as well.Winner: The Premier LeagueSix Premier League teams entered the Champions League, and five occupy the top eight of the league phase table, while the sixth finished 12th after a draw against the reigning champs in Paris Saint-Germain. Tottenham can't buy a win in the Premier League, but they navigated the league phase with ease after a season where they won the Europa League while finishing in 17th place. Newcastle United winger Anthony Gordon talked a bit about it while this may be the case in his pre-match availability ahead of facing PSG. \"I think in the Champions League, teams are much more open. They all try to play; it's less transitional. I think in the Premier League it's become more physical than I've ever known it to be,\" Gordon said. \"It's like a basketball game, sometimes it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's just a running game, and it's about duels. Who wins the duels wins the game or moments.\n\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game. It's a bit more football-based, where teams come and try to play proper football. I think in the Premier League, to see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces It's become a lot slower and set-piece based, I would say.\"It offers an interesting lens into play, and when you see players like Xavi Simons who have struggled in the Premier League but are doing well in Champions League play, Gordon's words have some merit. Of course, it's one of the best English teams at attacking and defending set plays, who sit atop the pile at this stage in Arsenal, but even they were able to mix it up to keep the squad fresh while competing on all fronts. English teams have won three of the last 10 Champions League finals, which is second to Real Madrid, carrying the LaLiga flag with five, while Germany and France have netted one a piece so maybe there is a shift in power in the water.Losers: Real Madrid Out of the Copa Del Rey and also out of the top eight of the Champions League, the Alvaro Arbeloa era isn't getting off to the greatest start for Real Madrid. He also won't have Raul Asencio and Rodrygo available for the first leg of the knockout phase after receiving red cards in stoppage time of their loss to Benfica. But not only did Real Madrid get knocked out, but they were dominated from start to finish, allowing 22 shots and an xG of 2.99 while holding 66% of the possession during the match. Sure, Los Blancos may need the extra games to get their defense into gear, but they could either face Benfica again in a two legged tie or a Bodo/Glimt side that just took it to Atletico Madrid and Manchester City and beat them. These are the kinds of runs that can lead to a third manager in a season, since getting knocked out before the round of 16 would be an unacceptable result for Real Madrid.  \n            ",

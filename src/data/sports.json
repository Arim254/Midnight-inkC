    "body": "\n        A UFC lightweight title shot could hang in the balance for Arman Tsarukyan and Dan Hooker. The UFC Fight Night headliners hope to use Saturday's fight in Doha, Qatar, as a launching pad to Ilia Topuria.Tsarukyan (22-3) checks off what should be the last stop on his redemption arc. His reputation took a major hit after UFC 311. Tsarukyan pulled out of his lightweight title fight with Islam Makhachev, citing a back injury. If losing his title shot wasn't bad enough, UFC CEO Dana White said Tsarukyan would need to earn another crack at gold. He made reparations by serving as backup for Topuria vs. Oliveira. Tsarukyan believes the UFC will position him as Topuria's next fight once he puts away an overmatched Hooker.Bet UFC Fight Night at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:\"If you compare our skills and who I fought and beat, I'm in the right spot. That's why I'm the No. 1 contender,\" Tsarukyan told CBS Sports. \"He lost all his opportunities against good fighters. He lost to Dustin Poirier, Islam Makhachev and Michael Chandler. He had good fights, but he lost his opportunities.\" \nHooker (24-12) is executing his master plan to leapfrog other contenders in the division. Hooker campaigned for the Tsarukyan fight, believing other top contenders were avoiding him. If Hooker cashes as a major underdog, he might find himself as the top contender. That's where the shortcuts end. Hooker believes Tsarukyan is the most skilled lightweight fighter, even greater than champion Topuria. \"He had no choice but to fight me,\" Hooker told CBS Sports. \"I knew that, looking at the division. I knew no one between him and me would take the fight. It's too risky. They have a good excuse because he pulled out of his title fight in the last five minutes with a sore back. So the champ Ilia has a good excuse not to face him.\" \nSaturday's co-main event also has title implications. Former welterweight champion Belal Muhammad looks to bounce back against rising contender Ian Machado Garry. A standout performance is imperative after Michael Morales and Carlos Prates notched highlight-reel knockouts at UFC 322. Muhammad and Garry have been trading barbs in the media over how their fight, a grappler vs. striker fight on the surface, will play out.\n\"I'm going to grab hold of him, I'm going to take  him down, then I'm going to let him back up, just because I'm going to  show him, 'I could take you down if I want to.' Then I'm going to outbox  him because he said he could outstrike me...\" Muhammad told MMA Junkie. \"It's finishing  him on the feet and reminding everybody who I am.\"\"That sounds like someone who can't hold me down... If you get me down, keep me down. Try that,\" Garry told CBS Sports in response, later adding, \"I think he's chatting out of his backside. I don't believe it for a second. I think he's playing reverse psychology. If he were smart, he'd be saying this. However, I genuinely think he's thick enough to believe that.\"Let's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings Sportsbook before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nUFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassArman Tsarukyan -650Dan Hooker +470LightweightIan Machado Garry -270Belal Muhammad+220WelterweightVolkan Oezdemir -225Alonzo Menifield +185Light heavyweightMyktybek Orolbai -250Jack Hermansson +205WelterweightWaldo Cortes Acosta -135Shamil Gaziev +114HeavyweightTagir Ulanbekov -218Kyoji Horiguchi +180FlyweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Nov. 22 | Start time: 1 p.m. ET (main card)Location: Doha, QatarStream: ESPN+PredictionArman Tsarukyan vs. Dan Hooker: Hooker winning would mark one of the best career comebacks in UFC history and thrust him into a high-profile fight with Topuria. I fear, however, it's an outcome reserved for fairytales. Tsarukyan is a nightmare for any lightweight. Tsarukyan is arguably the top lightweight wrestler after Makhachev's welterweight graduation. Hooker has great takedown defense, but Mateusz Gamrot managed to score five takedowns against him. Tsarukyan is almost as potent a takedown artist as Gamrot, with better top control. While it'd be irresponsible for Tsarukyan to kickbox with Hooker, his evolving striking and solid chin create opportunities to initiate takedowns. Hooker can drag people through hell, but Tsarukyan's well-roundedness allows him to put the fight in his wheelhouse. Pick: Tsarukyan via submission\n            ",

Celtic interim manager Martin O'Neill, though, confirmed on Friday that the 27-year-old will not play again this season.\"We will not see him,\" O'Neill said before Saturday's match at St. Mirren. \"I think it might be April before he's even on grass. Funnily enough, I did ask him yesterday, did he think he would be ready for the World Cup? And he said he thought that would be very doubtful.\"\nWith little more than six months to go until the USMNT's opening match of the World Cup, Carter-Vickers is the first member of the national team's player pool to face the possibility of missing the tournament with an injury. Though he has not been a fixture of the team since Mauricio Pochettino became the head coach in late 2024, there was a real opportunity for Carter-Vickers to make a case for himself -- Pochettino has recently begun to deploy a back three, a formation change that paved the way for their year-ending five game unbeaten run.Carter-Vickers was very recently on Pochettino's radar, too, joining the group for October's friendlies against Ecuador and Australia. He did not play in either match, though, and his only minutes under Pochettino came in March's 2-1 defeat to Canada in the Concacaf Nations League third place match, during which he played 90 minutes.\nThe center back was a member of the USMNT's 2022 World Cup squad, playing 90 minutes in the national team's group stage finale against Iran, which was a 1-0 victory.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A big fight card goes down on Saturday, with four world title bouts anchoring the action from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In the headliner, WBC light heavyweight champion David Benavidez will put his title on the line against Anthony Yarde. Benavidez moved up in weight after failed attempts to lure former undisputed super middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez into an epic showdown. He's fought twice since moving up to 175 pounds, outlasting Oleksandr Gvozdyk by decision and then battering David Morrell over 12 rounds in February.\"I've had my eye on Anthony Yarde for a long time. I know he's a great fighter. He has a lot of heart, he has a lot of power, and the thing I like about him is no matter who he's up against, he's in there to make it a great fight,\" Benavidez said at the final press conference this week. \"Me, I like to make every fight like I'm in a war. I like to give the people the fights they want to see. I had a great training camp. I've trained extremely hard and you know this fight is going to live up to the moment. Anthony Yarde, he's trying to capture a world title. I'm trying to capture all the titles and unify all the titles in the light heavyweight division so there's a lot at stake here.\"Bet the boxing action on Saturday night at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Plus, Brian Norman is set to take his WBO welterweight title against former undisputed lightweight king Devin Haney. Norman earned the interim title with a knockout of Giovani Santillan in May 2024 and was elevated to full champion in August of the same year after Terence Crawford vacated the title and moved up. Now, he faces Haney, who comes in off one of his worst performances in May where he beat Jose Ramirez. \nAnother big matchup sees Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez stake his WBC and WBO junior bantamweight title against WBA titleholder Fernando Martinez in a three-belt unification fight. Rodriguez, 25, has continued to impress with each passing fight. He's riding a three-fight knockout streak with finishes of Juan Francisco Estrada, Pedro Guevara and Phumelele Cafu. The first of the four title bouts scheduled sees Abdullah Mason take on Sam Noakes for the vacant WBO lightweight title.There are plenty of intriguing storylines running through the card, so let's take a look at the odds and break down all four world title fights.\nDavid Benavidez vs. Anthony Yarde fight card, oddsOdds via FanDuel SportsbookDavid Benavidez (c) -1200 vs. Anthony Yarde +680, WBC light heavyweight titleBrian Norman Jr. (c) -112 vs. Devin Haney -112, WBO welterweight titleJesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez (c) -1200 vs. Fernando Martinez (c) +670, unified junior bantamweight titleAbdullah Mason -430 vs. Sam Noakes +300, vacant WBO lightweight titleAbdullah Mason vs. Sam NoakesThe 21-year-old Mason (19-0, 17 KO) has been a hot prospect since turning professional in 2021. He has been on the standard prospect track of facing lower-level talent before slowly moving up to more difficult challenges. In his most recent fight, Mason faced the most dangerous test of his career, taking on Jeremia Nakathila. Nakathila was unable to continue after the fourth round as Mason cruised again.In Noakes (17-0, 15 KO), Mason is facing another up-and-comer, though one seven years his senior. Noakes' career has been very similar to Mason's, with a comparable stoppage rate and journey from facing lower-level talent to a few wins over veterans such as Yvan Mendy and Ryan Walsh.Mason is someone who feels as though he has the makings of a special fighter, while Noakes feels like he tops out at being a very good one. That said, neither fighter has faced much resistance in their careers; in their four combined fights that went to decision, they lost a total of two rounds. This has the potential to be a very good fight that teaches plenty about both fighters. Pick: Abdullah Mason via UD (+220)\nJesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez vs. Fernando MartinezRodriguez (22-0, 15 KO) had a breakthrough 2022, when he accepted a fight with Carlos Cuadras for the WBC super flyweight championship on one week's notice. Jumping up a weight class on short notice, Rodriguez won the title and defended it twice against Srisaket Sor Rungvisai and Israel Gonzalez before returning to flyweight. At flyweight, Rodriguez won two titles before returning to super flyweight, where he has continued piling up impressive victories while becoming a unified champion once again -- and grabbing the No. 5 spot in the CBS Sports pound-for-pound rankings.Martinez (18-0, 9 KO) is a fighter who thrives on aggression. He won the IBF title by beating Jerwin Ancajas in 2022. After winning the belt, Martinez successfully defended in a rematch before beating Jade Bornea and Kazuto Ioka (twice). The fight has been targeted for a while, and now the two best fighters at 115 pounds are set to mix it up.Rodriguez is a brilliant tactical fighter who unleashes combinations as well as anyone in the game. Martinez will have to figure out a way for his aggression to nullify Rodriguez's footwork and force the issue in exchanges. That's a big ask, though. Regardless, this has all the makings of one of the best fights of the year. Pick: Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez via UD (+290)\nBrian Norman Jr. vs. Devin HaneyHaney (32-0, 15 KO) comes into the fight as the bigger name. As the former undisputed lightweight champion, Haney has been in some huge fights in his career. As important as undisputed title fights against George Kambosos Jr. and Vasiliy Lomachenko were, the fight most people remember for Haney is the thumping he received from Ryan Garcia in April 2024. Haney was dropped by Garcia three times in a fight that came as Garcia appeared to be spiraling in a mental health crisis. Garcia, who also missed weight, failed drug tests, leading to a no-contest. By that technicality, Haney is still undefeated, but he looked very gunshy against Jose Ramirez in a terrible fight in May.Norman (28-0, 22 KO) packs plenty of power, and if Haney is still as worried about getting hit as he appeared to be against Ramirez, this could be a long night for him. Norman is on a career best run over his past three fights, winning the interim WBO welterweight belt by knocking out Giovani Santillan and being promoted to full champion when Terence Crawford vacated the belt to move up in weight. As champ, Norman has knocked out Derrieck Cuevas and Jin Sasaki.Haney opened the fight as a near -145 favorite but now sits at a slight -112 underdog to Norman's -120. It's hard to erase the image of Haney repeatedly crumbling when hit by Garcia's left hooks and the almost complete inability to get out of neutral against Ramirez in one of the worst fights you'll ever see. For those reasons, it's not difficult to see Norman scoring the biggest win of his career on Saturday. Pick: Brian Norman Jr. via TKO9 (+210)\nDavid Benavidez vs. Anthony YardeBoth main event fighters have promised a shootout. Benavidez told DAZN that he's happy to meet in a fan-friendly fight.\n\"I watched his fights,\" Benavidez said. \"He likes to go forward, he likes to press the action, he likes to look for the knockout, so I'm the same way. So I think at the end of the day it's going to be both egos going at each other -- who's going to back up? It's not going to be me. It's probably not going to be him, either.  \"When we're ready to go to war the people are going to see a great war, and that's what we're here for, to give the fans what they want to see.\"Benavidez (30-0, 24 KO) is now fully established at light heavyweight, a division he moved to when it was clear Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez was never going to meet him in the ring. Benavidez took an at times ugly win over Oleksandr Gvozdyk to win the WBC interim title and then defended that belt with a big win over fellow former super middleweight David Morrell. Now, having been promoted to full champion, Benavidez looks to make his first defense against Yarde.\nYarde (27-3, 24 KO) has twice challenged for light heavyweight world titles, losing to Sergey Kovalev in 2019 and Artur Beterbiev in 2023. In his losses to Kovalev and Lyndon Arthur, Yarde picked up a reputation as someone who was missing the ability to dig deep and a willingness to walk through fire when things got difficult. While Yarde was stopped by Beterbiev in the eighth round of their fight, he shook some of those labels by returning fire and digging deep to give Beterbiev a very difficult fight.Benavidez is the better fighter heading into this one, but his power has yet to fully translate to 175 pounds. The Yarde who showed up against Beterbiev could pull off a massive upset. That result does feel unlikely, though. Pick: David Benavidez via UD (+185)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A Virginia judge on Friday handed down five life sentences to former University of Virginia student Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., closing a wrenching week of testimony nearly two years after a shooting that devastated the Cavaliers' football program and the broader campus community.Jones, 26, received a life term for each of the three players he killed -- Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D'Sean Perry -- as well as for two surviving victims, running back Mike Hollins and student Marlee Morgan. Additional firearm convictions added more than two decades to the punishment. The sentence followed Jones' guilty plea last November to first-degree murder, aggravated malicious wounding and related gun charges.Judge Cheryl Higgins delivered the decision after five days of emotional testimony from witnesses, investigators and family members of the victims. Higgins criticized the nature of the attack, noting the lack of evidence that Jones had been threatened before opening fire, and described the shootings as execution-style. The attack occurred Nov. 13, 2022 aboard a charter bus returning from a class trip to Washington, D.C.The courtroom was packed throughout the proceedings with relatives and friends of the victims reacting audibly as each count was read. On Friday, before sentencing, Jones addressed the court for the first time. He apologized tearfully for the harm he caused to \"everyone on that bus,\" though some families walked out during his remarks, according to CVille Right Now.\nDuring the week, prosecutors outlined a chilling sequence that began when the bus parked in a campus garage around 10:15 p.m. Witnesses recalled a chaotic and terrifying scene as shots rang out, killing three members of the football program and wounding Hollins and Morgan. Both survivors later returned to UVA athletics -- Morgan joining the track team and Hollins returning to the field in 2023, where he received multiple courage awards for his comeback.Jones' defense team called relatives, mentors and an expert forensic psychologist in an effort to lessen the punishment. They argued Jones suffered physical and emotional abuse growing up, leaving him with deep trauma and what they described as \"delusional\" thinking. But after a contentious cross-examination -- and questions from the judge -- those arguments failed to move the court.\nJones had briefly been a walk-on player at Virginia in 2018 before leaving the program while remaining enrolled. His guilty plea last year removed the possibility of aggravated murder convictions but still exposed him to multiple life terms -- a sentence Higgins ultimately imposed.\n            ",

Every once in a while, we'll see a big free agent signing this early in the offseason -- Blake Snell with the Dodgers last year comes to mind -- but for the most part, it's the foundation-laying portion of the offseason for teams. We'll gather the news and rumors for the day right here. Cubs sign quality relieverThe Cubs have agreed to sign right-handed reliever Phil Maton to a two-year deal, The Athletic reports. Maton, 32, had a 2.79 ERA, 1.06 WHIP and 81 strikeouts in 61 ⅓ innings last season. Unlike many strikeout pitchers these days, Maton doesn't throw hard, sitting less than 90 miles per hour. He induces whiffs with his cutter, sinker, and curveball and excels at limiting hard contact. \nThe Cubs figured out a good bullpen last season in patchwork fashion, but several of their high-leverage arms have hit free agency, including Brad Keller, Caleb Thielbar and Drew Pomeranz while Andrew Kittredge was traded back to the Orioles. As things stand, it appears Maton will join Daniel Palencia and Porter Hodge in the late innings for the Cubs.D-backs bring back backup catcherThe Diamondbacks have brought back catcher James McCann on a one-year deal, the club announced. The veteran was a free agent until March 21 last season and signed with the Braves, only to be released on June 22 and then sign with the Diamondbacks the following day. \nIn 42 games with the D-backs, McCann hit .260/.324/.431 (107 OPS+) with five homers, 17 RBI and 1.0 WAR. He remains a quality defender and is a good backup for starter Gabriel Moreno.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Two longtime rivals on the West Coast meet in a pivotal Big Ten matchup that has major College Football Playoff implications when the No. 7 Oregon Ducks host the No. 15 USC Trojans at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore. The Ducks (9-1, 6-1 in the Big Ten) and Trojans (8-2, 6-1) are both technically alive for a Big Ten title berth as they're both tied with Michigan (8-2, 6-1). Losses by either No. 1 Ohio State or No. 2 Indiana could cause some chaos atop the conference standings. But this USC-Oregon matchup is more about CFP positioning as the Ducks may very well clinch a postseason berth with a win while the Trojans can't afford a third loss on the year. Bet college football Week 13, including USC at Oregon, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and three months of NBA League Pass. Click here to sign up:USC will need to solve its issues on the road to stay alive in the CFP hunt. Since coach Lincoln Riley arrived in Los Angeles in 2022, the Trojans are 1-6 when playing a ranked team on the road. That includes defeats at No. 23 Illinois and No. 13 Notre Dame this season. Over its last 20 games facing ranked opponents on the road, USC is 2-18. In addition, the Trojans haven't won in Autzen Stadium since 2011.Top sportsbooks have made Oregon a 10.5-point favorite over USC. The line has risen from -8.So what should you make of all that line movement? Is it a market correction or an overreaction? Here's a look at the Oregon-USC point spread, as well as the line movement on four other Week 13 games. All times Eastern.No. 22 Missouri at No. 8 Oklahoma (noon)Open: Oklahoma -10Current: Oklahoma -5.5This line was moving even before it was announced that Missouri QB Beau Pribula (ankle) will play on Saturday. That Pribula was upgraded to questionable helped move the line past -7, but it should be noted that Oklahoma has an elite defense and can make life tough on a QB who may be operating at less than 100% mobility. The Sooners' defense ranks second in the country in sacks per game (3.70). Oklahoma does face the possibility of a letdown one week after upsetting Alabama, but the value is now on the Sooners.Bet Week 13 college football games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:Ball State at Toledo (2 p.m.)Open: Toledo -23Current: Toledo -28This game features the biggest line movement of the week, with sportsbooks now making the Rockets four-touchdown favorites. The movement makes sense. Toledo is a perfect 5-0 at home this season, winning by an average of 40.0 points per game. Conversely, Ball State is 0-5 on the road this year, losing by 26.4 points a game. The Rockets boast the No. 1 offense and defense in the MAC, while the Cardinals are 12th (out of 13) in offense and 10th in defense. Toledo bettors won't get the best number, but it may not matter.Marshall at Appalachian State (2:30 p.m.)Open: Marshall -2Current: Marshall -5.5This point spread shift is a reaction to Appalachian State's recent slide. The Mountaineers have lost four in a row and are coming off a 58-10 blowout loss against James Madison. Though they are at home, they have dropped their last two home contests to Coastal Carolina and Georgia Southern. Meanwhile, the Thundering Herd (5-5, 3-3 in Sun Belt) still have incentive on Saturday; one more win makes Marshall bowl-eligible.Bet college football at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 15 USC at No. 7 Oregon (3:30 p.m.)Open: Oregon -8Current: Oregon -10.5This point spread has jumped quickly since open and got to 10.5. USC is hardly a bad team, but Oregon presents a tough challenge for the Trojans given the Ducks' ability to run the ball offensively and stop the pass defensively. This may force USC into a game it's not particularly comfortable with. Oregon bettors have missed the best number at this point, but the Ducks still seem to be the right side.New Mexico at Air Force (7 p.m.)Open: Air Force -1Current: New Mexico -3.5This line has completely flipped. The biggest reason? A key injury as Air Force quarterback Liam Szarka is out for the season with a broken arm. The Falcons now turn the offense over to Kemper Hodges, a 6-foot, 245-pound converted fullback who has taken just 39 snaps this year. Air Force scored nine points with Hodges in for Szarka in a loss to UConn. While a lot of focus will be on Szarka's injury, the Lobos (7-3) are in the midst of one of the best turnaround seasons in college football this year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 12 NFL odds feature four games with a spread of a field goal or less, while three contests have a double-digit NFL line. Amongst the former are Steelers vs. Bears (-2.5), with Aaron Rodgers' (wrist) listed as questionable, and Jaguars vs. Cardinals (+2.5), while double-digit favorites to place Week 12 NFL bets on are Seattle (-13.5) versus Tennessee and Detroit (-12.5) versus the Giants. A team that isn't even over .500 which is tied with Seattle as the biggest favorite on the Week 12 NFL schedule. Baltimore has won four straight to get back into the playoff picture, and they'll host the Jets on Sunday. The Ravens are at -13.5 to use in Week 12 NFL picks, and while double-digit favorites are 10-1 straight up this season, they are just 6-5 ATS. One of those games whose spread falls in between the aforementioned extremes is Chiefs vs. Colts, which has another .500 team in Kansas City as 3.5-point favorites over an 8-2 Colts squad coming off a bye. All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Arizona is 6-1 ATS versus AFC opponents since 2024, which is the second-best spread record for any team in non-conference matchups. Meanwhile, the Jags are just 1-4 ATS this year outside of Jacksonville, and the takeaways that fueled their early success have nearly dried up. The Jaguars averaged 3.3 takeaways over their first four games but have averaged just 0.8 turnovers forced per game over their last six. Thus, extra offensive possessions for Arizona allow it to take advantage of the Jags' 26th-ranked passing defense, as Jacoby Brissett is projected to have more yards and touchdowns than Trevor Lawrence. With that, the Cardinals cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Ravens (-13.5, 44.5) cover versus the Jets in well over 50% of simulations. New York is coming off a mini-bye, having played last Thursday, but there's no spread advantage with this rest edge. The Jets are 3-11-1 ATS over their last 15 games when they have a rest advantage over their opponent. Their Sunday opponent, Baltimore, has recently looked like the team most expected them to be all season as the Ravens have allowed just 14.8 points over their last five games. That includes a pair of games versus top-10 scoring offenses, but the team doesn't have to worry about seeing that with the Jets, who rank dead last in passing offense and 25th in scoring. Baltimore covers with points to spare, and the model also says the Over hits in over 70% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 12 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines.

    "body": "\n        Week 12 has arrived for NFL DFS players, and there are three matchups on the Sunday 'main slate' that feature an over/under of 50 points or higher. Lions vs. Giants, Colts vs. Chiefs and Patriots vs. Bengals will all be potential sources of major offense. While NFL DFS lineups won't feature Ja'Marr Chase (suspension) this week, they could feature Joe Burrow, who has returned to practice for the first time in around two months and is listed as questionable (toe) to play against the Pats on Sunday.Which NFL DFS picks from those matchups should you target, and are there players from potentially lower-scoring games like Seahawks vs. Titans or Raiders vs. Browns who should factor into your NFL DFS strategy? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Week 12, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to Week 12's Sunday main slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Week 12Part of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for the Week 12 main slate is rostering Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce at $5,000 on DraftKings and $6,000 on FanDuel. Generally the most expensive tight end in the player pool in recent years, Kelce is now the third-most expensive TE option on the main slate for both sites as his overall production has slipped. McClure, however, is encouraged by his massive numbers last week that included season highs in targets (13), receptions (9) and yards (91). The Colts rank 30th in the league in points given up to opposing Fantasy tight ends, opening the door for a massive day for Kelce in what could be a high-scoring game. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Packers running back Emanuel Wilson ($6,500 on FanDuel, $5,300 on DraftKings), who could see a big workload with Josh Jacobs (knee) listed as questionable. Wilson, a third-year pro out of Fort Valley State, did a nice job in relief last week with 49 scrimmage yards and a score. He was also effective against the Steelers last month in the other game he saw extensive action, piling up 87 scrimmage yards. Minnesota has given up the ninth-most rushing yards to opposing backs this year and the Vikings might not have starting edge Jonathan Greenard (shoulder, questionable). See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Week 12McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        While much of the focus around the Bengals this week has been the uncertainty of the quarterback situation, one person who won't be on the field has been cemented since the start of the week -- and that's star wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase. With the Cincinnati WR1 suspended following a spitting incident last week with Jalen Ramsey, Tee Higgins rises to that WR1 spot. And with Higgins catching passes from Joe Flacco, he should be in line for a heavy target share and given the Bengals' offensive success the majority of the season, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has Higgins as one of its top picks for Week 12 anytime TD scorer bets at +120 odds at online sports betting sites. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 12 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Raiders running back Ashton Jeanty and Ravens tight end Mark Andrews to cash for Week 12 anytime TD scorer bets.Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 12 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 12 NFL picks. It can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest Fanatics Sportsbook promo code CBSFAN, which allows new users to bet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets in FanCash.Best Week 12 NFL anytime touchdown picks:Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+105)Tee Higgins, Bengals (+130)Mark Andrews, Ravens (+155)Parlay these picks for +995 odds with a FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5 or more wins: (odds subject to change)Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+105)The Raiders' rookie running back hasn't lived up to his No. 6 overall billing, but much of that can be attributed to the Las Vegas' offense faltering as a whole. When the Raiders are scoring, it's often Jeanty delivering those touchdowns as he's accounted for seven of the team's 16 trips to the end zone. Las Vegas plays the Browns, who do have a strong defense. But with Shedeur Sanders starting at quarterback for Cleveland, there could be an increased likelihood of short drives and turnovers, leading to better field position. Jeanty has scored a touchdown in two of his last three games, and at plus money, the model likes his odds to find the end zone at home against a struggling Cleveland team. Click here to bet on Jeanty as a Week 12 anytime touchdown scorer at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:Tee Higgins, Bengals (+120)Higgins will be the focal point of the Bengals' offense with Ja'Marr Chase (suspension) out, and he's scored a touchdown in each of his last two games he played without Chase on the field. Higgins was a huge part of the game plan in each of his last three contests without Chase, averaging 134 yards in those three games, with more than 110 yards in each contest. Higgins also has a touchdown in four straight games this season. The Bengals' offense has been one of the most productive units in the league with either quarterback starting, and the model projects value in Higgins at +120 odds to score against the Patriots.Click here to bet on Higgins as a Week 12 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $150 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Mark Andrews, Ravens (+155)Lamar Jackson reappeared on the injury report this week, but he is a full-go for Sunday, which is great for the entire Baltimore offense, but especially Andrews. The two have had a strong rapport throughout their eight-year career as they were both selected by the Ravens in the 2018 NFL Draft. Andrews has five touchdown receptions this season, all coming in the seven games Jackson has played. Andrews, who had 11 touchdowns last season, has scored in three straight games, last week on a 35-yard run on a rollout out of the tush-push formation on a trick play. He has four touchdowns over his last three games heading into a matchup against the Jets, who have the No. 27 scoring defense at 26.8 ppg allowed this season. The Ravens are 13.5-point favorites, so there should be plenty of Baltimore touchdown opportunities, and the model expects the Jackson-to-Andrews connection to shine again on Sunday.Click here to bet on Andrews as a Week 12 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $150 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Want more Week 12 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 12.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        In a roster move that has long been expected, the Miami Dolphins have released wide receiver Tyreek Hill. The move, announced by the team on Monday, comes ahead of contract guarantees that take effect during the 2026 season. Hill suffered a devastating, season-ending knee injury in September and is expected to miss much of the offseason in recovery.Hill's extension signed last offseason was worth $90 million, with a final year cap hit of nearly $52 million. It was mostly served to increase the average annual salary mark that is used as the most common metric for ranking player salaries.\"The 2026 contract year has $29.9 million in non-guaranteed base salary, including $11 million in guaranteed salary if Hill is on the roster on the third day of the 2026 league year,\" CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones wrote earlier this offseason. \"A $5 million roster bonus is due on the same day, meaning that the Dolphins would guarantee Hill $16 million if he's on the roster come March 14. Because the final year was mostly cosmetic, the final year of the contract did not include money that would guarantee in the event of injury.\"Hill's fourth season in Miami ended with 21 catches for 265 yards and a touchdown, this coming after his production in 2024 was the lowest of his career.\nThe Dolphins hired Jeff Hafley as their new coach in January, moving on from Mike McDaniel. By releasing Hill before June 1, the Dolphins take a $28.2 million dead cap hit in 2026.Hill, 31, recently said in an interview with People that he is walking without a brace. Hill, who in September was accused several domestic violence-related incidents by his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, has not hinted at retirement despite the injury and off-the-field items.\n\"My focus right now is just playing ball and spending time with my kids and just doing what I'm best at: providing for my family,\" Hill said at the time. \"So all the noise, I feel like if you allow that kind of stuff to get in the way of what you're trying to do, it can only cloud what you're really trying to get accomplished.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A day like today was always coming for the Dolphins. Maybe it was before the season. Maybe it was when they started 0-3, or when wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered a brutal knee injury in Week 4, or when they fired GM Chris Grier and sold at the trade deadline. When they benched Tua Tagovailoa and, a few weeks later, fired coach Mike McDaniel, the writing was officially on the wall.The Dolphins, as we knew them for the past four seasons, were a thing of the past, and their roster teardown began in earnest Monday when they released Hill, edge rusher Bradley Chubb, offensive lineman James Daniels and wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.Hill and Chubb are the headliners. When the Dolphins were at their best, making the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, so, too, was Hill. He had 1,710 receiving yards in 2022 and 1,799 in 2023. He not only became the first player in NFL history with 1,700+ yards in multiple seasons, but he did it in consecutive seasons. Miami's offense hummed along; it led the NFL in yards and was second in points in 2023.Chubb was part of the effort to elevate the defense to, if not a similar level, at least a viable level. The Dolphins sent a first-round pick to the Broncos in 2022 and signed Chubb to a five-year, $110 million extension. The Dolphins made the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, with Chubb racking up 11 sacks and a league-leading six forced fumbles in the latter.\n\n        \n            \n                Tyreek Hill landing spots: Chiefs, Bills and other AFC contenders among top fits with Dolphins releasing WR\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe excitement came to an end even faster that it had arrived, a tale as old as time in the NFL. The Dolphins' playoff duds revealed serious flaws. Tagovailoa struggled with concussions. Chubb missed the entire 2024 season with a torn ACL. Miami missed the postseason each of the last two seasons.Now, new GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and new coach Jeff Hafley -- both from the Packers -- are turning over a new leaf. Monday's releases clear $56 million in 2026 cap space, per NFL Media. That duo still has much to do, though.The fact that Sullivan comes from Green Bay shouldn't be lost. The Packers once moved on from a veteran quarterback and didn't skip a beat. They built the NFL's youngest roster and loaded it with talent.\nDon't expect a similar path in the immediate future from Miami, which is in a very different spot. Miami can begin to dig itself out of its mess this offseason, but this is very much a multiyear project. Here are the first steps.Figure out Tua Tagovailoa's futureThis is the elephant in the room. Last week, Sullivan said the Dolphins were \"getting close\" on a decision regarding the embattled quarterback, and he has previously said the team would look at all options at quarterback this offseason.The expectation is that the Dolphins move on. It's much easier said than done. As Jordan Dajani wrote earlier this month:\nThe former No. 5 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension prior to the 2024 season after a career year. Trading Tagovailoa would be ideal, but Miami would have to eat a chunk of the $54 million guaranteed salary he has in 2026. Plus, there would be a $45.2 million dead cap hit if Tagovailoa is traded before June 1 as well. It would appear a cut is more likely, but that has ramifications, too.Tagovailoa release with post-June 1 designation (via Spotrac) 2026 dead cap$67,400,0002027 dead cap$31,800,0002026 savings$-11,132,353Parting ways with Tagovailoa would leave 2025 sixth-rounder Cam Miller (originally drafted by the Raiders) and 2025 seventh-rounder Quinn Ewers as the only quarterbacks under contract for the 2026 season.\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: Tua Tagovailoa, A.J. Brown among 15 players who could be traded or released in 2026 offseason\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFigure out quarterback plans for 2026 (and beyond?)The name that comes up most often with Tagovailoa's impending departure is Russell Wilson. In 2024, the Broncos released Wilson, incurring a $53 million dead cap hit. That's still the record; Tagovailoa's $67.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 would shatter it.Sullivan and Hafley have a blank canvas here. Ewers looked like a seventh-round rookie playing out the string last year. If they want to give him another year -- or see what they have in Miller -- they could, but it would likely mean they're punting on the season. Since the NFL Draft shrunk to seven rounds in 1994, only one rookie drafted in the seventh round won double-digit games in his second year or earlier: Brock Purdy. If Sullivan and Hafley believe they have the next Purdy (and the next Kyle Shanahan in offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik), more power to them. In all likelihood, neither Ewers nor Miller is the answer.One of the main reasons the Broncos were able to rebound from the Wilson disaster is they had the 12th pick in the quarterback-rich 2024 draft. They selected Bo Nix and, alongside coach Sean Payton and a strong defense, emerged as one of the NFL's top teams in short order.The Dolphins don't have the luxury of a quarterback-rich draft. Fernando Mendoza is the only surefire first-round quarterback; the 2024 class had six quarterbacks in the top 12. Miami could opt for a mid-round quarterback if Sullivan and co. find one they like.Before that, though, the Dolphins will have opportunities in free agency. The most obvious tie is Malik Willis, who played well in relief of Jordan Love in Green Bay. Willis is a wild card in this class. Is he viewed as a bridge quarterback or one worthy of a sizable long-term contract? His play in Green Bay was admirable; it also came in very small doses and under a premier offensive mind in Matt LaFleur. If Sullivan and Hafley want to reunite with Willis, it will have to be at a cost that isn't prohibitive given the incoming financial implications of the Tagovailoa departure.Other options include a veteran who could provide a viable baseline -- think Wilson, Joe Flacco or Marcus Mariota -- or a trade for a low-end starter, like Mac Jones. Sullivan might be reticent to give up draft capital, though, and that would make sense given the situation.The best path forward could be a combination of sorts: a veteran plus a mid-round pick, neither of whom would preclude them from drafting a quarterback in 2027, when the quarterback pool is projected to be much stronger.Improve the trenches and the defensive secondaryIn a significant win for the Dolphins, Aaron Brewer came out of nowhere to be one of the NFL's premier centers in 2025. A second-team All-Pro, Brewer is 28 and has one more year left on his deal. He will be a key holdover for Miami in its new era. Left tackle Patrick Paul, a 2024 second-round pick, showed significant improvement in his second year, too.Around them, though, are major questions. Left guard Jonah Savaiinaea, a second-round pick in 2025, struggled mightily as a rookie. Right guard Cole Strange was marginally better. Right tackle Larry Borom was OK.\n2025 Dolphins OLPFF rankLT Patrick Paul43rd out of 84 OTsLG Jonah Savaiinaea79th out of 79 OGsC Aaron Brewer2nd out of 37 CsRG Cole Strange57th out of 79 OGsRT Larry Borom58th out of 84 OTsAn upgrade or two would help whomever plays quarterback in 2026 as well as De'Von Achane, who figures to be a fulcrum after a breakout 2025.The Dolphins have now moved on from both Chubb and Jaelan Phillips (traded to the Eagles at the deadline), two edge rushers who looked to be a significant part of Miami's future just a few months ago. Again, things change quickly in the NFL. Miami would love to see a bounce-back campaign from 2024 first-round pick Chop Robinson and a major leap from 2025 first-round pick Kenneth Grant. Absent those developments, there's a dearth of young talent on the defensive front -- another imposing challenge moving forward.The Dolphins could also use upgrades in the secondary around Minkah Fitzpatrick, who continues to provide solid play, if not his previous All-Pro level. Cornerback will be a major area of focus after injuries derailed the group in 2025.\nRealize it won't all happen in one yearLet's go back to the 2024 Broncos. As outlined above, this isn't the 2024 class at quarterback. The 2026 Dolphins also won't be the 2024 Broncos when it comes to young talent. Denver had three All-Pro defenders in cornerback Patrick Surtain II (the Defensive Player of the Year), edge rusher Nik Bonitto and defensive lineman Zach Allen. All were in their age-27 season or younger. If the Dolphins have one young defender become an All-Pro in 2026, it'd be a significant success in the short and long terms.One of the worst things an NFL team can do is lie to itself about where it is. Sullivan and Hafley need and deserve a long runway, and they need to use every inch of it. This is a roster in a bad spot in terms of current talent and means to acquire it. That's what happens when a $212 million bet on a quarterback goes bust, and the roster was already in a tenuous spot.Miami has its own first- and second-round picks and three third-round picks. That's five picks in the top 90. Before they even get there, though, they owe it to themselves to find the right free agent crop.\nIt doesn't have to be the \"best\" crop -- and it won't be. But it needs to be the right crop. Veterans who can establish a solid, dependable baseline and foster a culture for the youngsters. Swings on players in or approaching their primes who needed a change of scenery.Rome wasn't built in a day; Miami's new era won't be either. But with a smart, measured approach to free agency, hits in the draft and internal development, the Dolphins can gradually build toward a bright future -- something they haven't had in several years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n            \n    \n        Green Bay coach Doug Gottlieb went on a rant in his postgame press conference after his team's 75-72 loss at Milwaukee on Sunday. In the tirade, which lasted several uncomfortable minutes, Gottlieb slammed his fists on a table and demanded an explanation from the Horizon League after he was assessed a critical technical foul late in the second half in an eventual one-possession loss.The technical foul came with just under seven minutes remaining in the game and with his Phoenix leading 59-57. Gottlieb defended his actions from the sequence and said nothing he did was enough to warrant a technical, including refraining from cursing and not leaving his coach's box. \"I need the league to explain to me why I got a technical foul when I did not curse, I was not demonstrative, I did not leave my box,\" Gottlieb said. \"All I said was, 'That's the same play as the other end.' All we ask is that it's a fair game. That's all we ask.\"Gottlieb said his issue was not only with the technical, but also with the sequence within the game that eventually led to the technical. From his view, he saw two similar plays with two different outcomes -- both in favor of the other team -- that were officiated differently.\n\"I need Donnie [Ripley] (the Horizon League's Coordinator of Officials) and the new commissioner to explain to me the disparity in the officiating,\" Gottlieb continued. \"You had the exact same play at both ends in the last play of the game. The exact same f****** play. The exact same play. So I need the new commissioner to explain to me what a technical foul is when I don't leave the box, I don't curse, I'm not demonstrative. There was nothing that should've been called a technical foul.\"\nGreen Bay's loss snapped a three-game winning streak and dropped it to 10-7 in league play, putting a .500 finish in conference play on the table.There have been plenty of highs and lows for Green Bay this season -- including an infamous chair-tossing incident from Gottlieb after blowing a double-digit lead -- but it's hard to argue anything other than it's a marked improvement on his first year at the helm of the program. The team finished 4-28 in 2024-25 and at one point endured a 21-game losing streak from late November through mid-February.\nSunday's loss put Green Bay 2.5 games behind league-leading Wright State with three regular-season games remaining, but it's not impossible to think this team could sneak into the NCAA Tournament this year as the league's automatic berth if it wins the Horizon League tourney. Green Bay played Wright State close two weeks ago and defeated Robert Morris on the road in late January.\n            \n    ",

They controlled play in the first period, but an excellent effort from Swedish goaltender Ebba Svensson Traff kept the score close. That was followed by a red, white and blue avalanche in the second period.Thanks to three goals on three shots in under three minutes, the Americans blew the game wide open and took a 5-0 lead into the third period. From there, the U.S. put it in cruise control with the final in sight.\nThis blowout win over Sweden was a team effort for the U.S. as five different players found the back of the net and 13 different players registered a point. The only two players to find the scoresheet multiple times were Hannah Bilka and Abbey Murphy. The former tallied two assists, and the latter notched one goal and one helper.The Americans have simply been a runaway train in these Olympics, and they haven't allowed a goal since the second period of their opening game against Finland. The U.S. has strung together five consecutive shutouts and has outscored its opponents 31-1 in this tournament.Team USA can finish off one of the most dominant runs in Olympic history in the gold medal game on Thursday afternoon.

    "body": "\n        The divorce between 2010s NFL All-Decade Team wide receiver Tyreek Hill and the Miami Dolphins finally came to fruition Monday, with Miami cutting him loose, per CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones.Hill, who will turn 32 on March 1, was set to carry a $51.1 million cap hit in 2026 -- the final year of a three-year, $90 million extension -- which would have given him the highest cap number among non-quarterbacks this coming season. He tore his ACL in Week 4 of the 2025 season against the New York Jets in late September, meaning he likely won't return until roughly a quarter of the way through the 2026 campaign.Those two factors led the Dolphins' new regime -- head coach Jeff Hafley and general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan -- to move on before free agency opens in March. The decision leaves Miami with $28.2 million in dead money, but it also creates $22.9 million in cap savings by jettisoning Hill now.After being acquired in a trade with the Kansas City Chiefs prior to the 2022 season, Hill was arguably the NFL's most dominant receiver in his first two years in South Florida. From 2022 to 2023, he led the league in receiving yards (3,509) and receiving yards per game (106.3) while ranking second in receptions (238) and third in receiving touchdowns (20). His production began to tail off in 2024, and he ended that season by saying he was \"out\" after Miami's Week 18 loss to the Jets.\nTyreek Hill's career with Dolphins2022-232024-25Games played3321Receptions238102Receiving yards per game106.3*58.3Receiving yards per reception14.712.0Receiving yards3,509*1,225Receiving touchdowns207* Led NFL While there's a lot working against Hill, he should still command a free-agent market. His 11,363 career receiving yards rank ninth-most by a player in his first 10 seasons in NFL history, and his 28 touchdowns of 50 yards or longer are the fourth-most all time. Only Hall of Famer Jerry Rice (36), three-time Pro Bowler DeSean Jackson (34) and Hall of Famer Randy Moss (29) have more.So where could Hill land in 2026? Here's a look at six potential landing spots for the five-time first-team All-Pro.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThis is the obvious one. The Chiefs have salary cap work to do to become compliant before the new league year begins March 11, but a reunion makes sense. Since trading Hill in 2022, Kansas City hasn't had a true No. 1 wide receiver alongside future Hall of Fame tight end Travis Kelce.Hill accounted for just over 25% of Kansas City's receiving yards in his final two seasons there (2020–21). Since his departure, Kelce leads the team at 22.7%, with wide receiver Rashee Rice second at just 10.2%.Hill and quarterback Patrick Mahomes would also be returning from ACL injuries suffered in 2025, potentially putting their timelines in sync. Hill tweeted about his intrigue regarding offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy's return to Kansas City. With Kelce possibly entering his final season in 2026, the Chiefs could reunite their championship trio for one last ride.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills If a Chiefs reunion doesn't materialize, the wide receiver-needy Bills could call their former rival to help quarterback Josh Allen. Khalil Shakir led Buffalo with just 719 receiving yards in 2025, and the team's receiver usage was unstable, with a league-high eight players logging 100-plus snaps.Like Kansas City, Buffalo must navigate cap constraints, but Allen's elite arm talent could entice both sides in a shared push for Super Bowl relevance.Hill also tweeted sympathy for the Bills following their overtime playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, so perhaps he wouldn't need much persuading to join Buffalo.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersHill to the Chargers makes sense on several levels. Financially, Los Angeles can afford it, entering the offseason with $78.6 million in effective cap space. That's second-most in the NFL, per Over the Cap.Quarterback Justin Herbert's arm strength is another draw. His 24,820 passing yards rank second-most through a player's first six seasons, trailing only Hall of Famer Peyton Manning (24,885).There's also scheme familiarity: former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel now serves as the Chargers' offensive coordinator. Hill could step into a system he already knows and produce quickly once healthy. Hill even tweeted that McDaniel's move to Los Angeles caught his attention.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersThe Raiders are primed for an offensive overhaul after hiring Super Bowl LX champion Klint Kubiak as head coach following his title run as Seattle's offensive coordinator.They also hold the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, widely expected to become Indiana national championship-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the 2025 Heisman Trophy winner.Las Vegas already features 2024 No. 6 pick running back Ashton Jeanty and 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, plus $76.99 million in effective cap space, third-most in the NFL.Hill would also fit Kubiak's system since the new head coach also worked as a San Francisco 49ers assistant coach under Kyle Shanahan -- just like McDaniel did before thriving with Hill in Miami. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England Patriots The Patriots won the AFC but ran out of steam in Super Bowl LX, falling behind 19-0 in an eventual 29-13 loss to Seattle. Hill could inject needed explosiveness into a receiver room led by Stefon Diggs, who is currently dealing with legal issues. After Diggs' 1,013 receiving yards and tight end Hunter Henry's 768, Kayshon Boutte ranked next among Patriots wideouts with 551 yards in 2025.Hill has shown interest in New England, tweeting his happiness after their AFC title. The Patriots also have $36.9 million in effective cap space -- 11th-most in the NFL -- and could make another win-now move while Drake Maye remains on his rookie deal.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersThe 49ers ran out of bodies in 2025, a season that ended with a 41-6 divisional-round loss in Seattle. San Francisco lost 270 player games to injury -- the most of any playoff team -- and the attrition showed in the biggest games.\nReceiver uncertainty looms, with Jauan Jennings set for free agency and Brandon Aiyuk missing in action. Brock Purdy still delivered elite efficiency, however, despite missing eight games with a turf toe injury: 58.3% of his third- and fourth-down pass attempts combined produced first downs, the highest rate in the last 35 seasons, per CBS Sports Research.San Francisco enters the offseason with $37.5 million in effective cap space (10th-most). Hill fits the team's win-now window with Christian McCaffrey still producing and Trent Williams still chasing a title. Hill played for a Shanahan acolyte in Mike McDaniel. In San Francisco, he'd play for the architect of the offensive system that helped him soar in Miami.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's important to draw a distinction between resume metrics and predictive metrics when talking about a team like Miami University and the NCAA Tournament bubble. Selection decisions are closely tied to your resume and what you've accomplished, which is a good thing for Miami. The cries are already coming: \"but Miami hasn't even played a Quad 1 game.\"Despite the fact that it has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of Miami's 25-0 start.It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a 1.92 WAB, the Redhawks are recognized for having nearly two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.If Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. The Redhawks rank No. 34 in WAB entering Tuesday night's game at UMass, which appears to be the most challenging of six regular season games left on their slate. That's within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty.\nHere are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami UniversityThe simple scenario (win MAC Tournament) Record: Between 28-6 and 34-0 Confidence level: It's a partyLikely WAB range: Doesn't matterBust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 6-0 to close the regular season, 0-6 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the Redhawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14. \nWinning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The Redhawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams.Many of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the Redhawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Iowa State vs. Houston game will impact No. 1 seed race for NCAA Tournament\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe MAC Madness scenarioSelection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1Confidence level: optimisticLikely WAB range: 35-43\nMiami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the Redhawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat.A loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the Redhawks from No. 34 in the metric to No. 42.The team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43.\nFinishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the Redhawks in the upper 30s or lower 40s of WAB, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.Double defeat scenarioSelection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2Confidence level: nervousLikely WAB range: 43-52The double defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game. \nThis would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly.The team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally. Miami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.\nThree-loss scenarioSelection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3Confidence level: bracing for disappointmentLikely WAB range: 50-60A 4-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the Redhawks lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make. With three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the Redhawks lost three times.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Bradley Chubb era in Miami is over, as the Dolphins are set to release the veteran pass rusher, according to multiple reports.Miami originally acquired Chubb in 2022, trading first- and fourth-round picks, along with running back Chase Edmonds, to the Denver Broncos in exchange for Chubb and a fifth-round pick. He then signed a five-year, $110 million contract extension with Miami that was originally set to keep him with the Dolphins through the 2027 season.However, Chubb was set to draw a base salary of $18.5 million and count $31.5 million against the cap in 2026, so the Dolphins will cut ties rather than bring him back at that number. Now he'll hit the open market at age 29 (he turns 30 in June) and will be free to sign with any team. Chubb had 8.5 sacks and eight tackles for loss in 2024, but the sack total probably overstates his effectiveness as a pass rusher. That figure ranked tied for 20th in the NFL, but he tied for 40th in pressures (48) and checked in 68th in pressure rate (13.0%), according to TruMedia. His 11% pass-rush win rate, per Pro Football Focus, was also below average.\nStill, he has something left in the tank, and with that in mind, we wanted to take a look at some of the teams that might fit once the Dolphins officially grant his release.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe Colts have been looking for pass-rush help for a while. They checked in just 23rd in pressure rate last season, via TruMedia, and need someone to rush opposite Laiatu Latu, who also collected 8.5 sacks in 2025. Indianapolis has just south of $36 million in cap space heading into the offseason, according to Over the Cap, and should have plenty of room to add Chubb regardless of what type of salary he commands.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Carolina PanthersThe Panthers could have a pretty solid defense if they could rush the passer even a little. They finished 31st in pressure rate during the 2025 regular season, with only the New York Jets generating a sack, hit or hurry on a smaller share of opponent dropbacks. Carolina doesn't have much cap room this offseason, but if it can land Chubb on an affordable short-term deal, he'd be worth adding to a room that lacks juice.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysDallas actually pressured the quarterback pretty well in 2025. The issue is that the Cowboys have exactly two edge rushers under contract for 2026: Donovan Ezeiruaku and James Houston. They need to fill out the room with several bodies, and bringing in Chubb could make sense so long as they don't break the bank, given their other defensive needs.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago BearsThe Bears, like the Colts and Panthers, didn't get after the quarterback much this past season. They ranked 29th in pressure rate despite employing Montez Sweat on one side of the line. The rest of the edge group just did not have any juice whatsoever. Chubb isn't the type of player who will solve the problem single-handedly, but as part of a multi-pronged approach, he could make sense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee TitansThe Titans have needs on both sides of the ball, but they also have more cap space than any team in the NFL, with over $100 million to spend, according to Over the Cap. They could use some of it to bring in Chubb to help an edge room that simply doesn't have many bodies at the moment.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tampa Bay BuccaneersThe Bucs tried to juice up their pass rush last offseason by adding Haason Reddick. It didn't work out. They could take a similar flier on Chubb, who has at least been productive more recently than Reddick, who was coming off a lost season in New York and Philadelphia when Tampa signed him last year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The MAC is adding Sacramento State as a football-only member starting in 2026, the conference announced on Monday. The Hornets will join the conference on July 1 for a five-year term. Sac State will serve as a replacement for Northern Illinois in the MAC. The Huskies will officially depart for the Mountain West as a football-only member this summer. \"Today's exciting announcement is about strengthening our competitive profile and creating value for the membership,\" MAC Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said in a release. \"We were presented with an opportunity to add an institution with demonstrated success in football, a record of investment and commitment to the continued growth of the institution and community.  Sacramento State is ready and poised for this next step.  I welcome the Hornets to the Mid-American Conference and expect they will become a competitive and contributing member to the long history and legacy of one of the oldest Division I conferences.\"According to ESPN, Sac State's cost of entry is expected to be around $18 million.Sac State has not released its 2026 football schedule, but multiple programs have announced games against the Hornets including Tarleton State, Maine and North Alabama. Sac State is also scheduled to face Fresno State in Week 2, as outlined in the Pac-12 schedule release. \n\n        \n            \n                Longtime FCS standard bearer North Dakota State seeks fresh challenge with leap to FBS\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSac State moved all non-football sports to from the Big Sky to the Big West last summer and applied for a waiver to join the FBS as an independent. After that waiver was denied by the NCAA, the school competed for one final football season in the Big Sky, finishing 7-5 overall with a 5-3 conference mark.Meanwhile, school president Luke Wood and athletic director Mark Orr went back to the drawing board, with the MAC mebership emerging as the most logical path to the FBS. The Hornets have also been preparing on the NIL front, with a budget \"north of $1 million,\" a source told CBS Sports. The school hired Arizona assistant Alonzo Carter on Dec. 15 after former coach Brennan Marion departed to join Deion Sanders' Colorado staff as offensive coordinator. \nCarter is a first-time head coach who has spent the last eight seasons working under Brent Brennan at both San Jose State and Arizona. He has deep recruiting ties to California after starting his career as a high school coach in the state.\"We are thrilled to welcome Alonzo Carter as our next head football coach,\" Orr said in a statement released by the school. \"Coach Carter is a proven leader who has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to developing student-athletes on and off the field. His history of success in recruiting, constructing teams, and producing results at all levels of football makes him an ideal fit for Sacramento State. We look forward to welcoming him and his family back to his native Northern California and having him as part of the Sacramento community for years to come.\"The Hornets will be the second FCS school to make the jump in 2026, joining North Dakota State. The Bison moved up from the Missouri Valley Conference to the Mountain West earlier this month. \n            ",

Many of these teams are going to prioritize playing aggressive at home and parking when on the road. Galatasaray is one of the clubs that will want to make an impact in the first leg at home, because traveling to Italy is going to be hard. Juventus will be the same; survive on the road and dominate at home. I'm taking Galatasaray to do some damage in that first leg and I'm shocked to see them as heavy underdogs playing in their stadium that rocked even the likes of Liverpool.Bet on Galatasaray vs. Juventus in the Champions League playoff first leg at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first wager of $5 or more wins: Borussia Dortmund vs. AtalantaDortmund Over 1.5 team total (-120): 1 unitDortmund money line (+100): 0.5 unitsDortmund's form in the new year continues to be spectacular, especially when playing at home. They've won four of their last five matches at home in the new year, and continue to be one of the most intimidating squads in all of Europe whenever playing in front of their home fans. Atalanta are in good form right now but their defense is easily rattled, and Dortmund know if they want to advance, they need to make something big happen in this first leg. This is the kind of match where I bet you Dortmund win at home and then Atalanta also win at home, so the question is going to be who does it better. Expect Dortmund to go for multiple goals in this first leg.Back Dortmund to win against Atalanta at FanDuel, where new users get $100 in bonus bets after winning their first bet of $5 or more:Monaco vs. PSGOusmane Dembele anytime goal scorer (+110): 1 unitIt's always weird seeing a UCL match with two teams from the same league. We have so much head-to-head and league data to look through with these two Ligue 1 giants clashing. Monaco at home are strong, but I'm expecting PSG to not only win but win by multiple goals. Monaco embarrassed PSG back in November after beating them 1-0 in a match where they were a man down. Since then, Monaco have been in poor form, and PSG will be looking for a big start to the next round of UCL. Players like Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembele will all be starting up top. All three of these guys know how to score against Monaco, but I'm backing the best goal scorer in France in Dembele.Bet on Ousmane Dembele to score in Monaco vs. PSG Champions League action at bet365, where new users can get $200 in bonus bets after wagering $5 or more with bonus code SPORTSLINE:Benfica vs. Real MadridReal Madrid Over 1.5 team total (-130): 1 unitKylian Mbappe first goal scorer (+270): 0.5 unitsReal Madrid will come into this match as the most experienced UCL team in all of Europe. They'll also come into this match in fantastic form after beating down a strong Real Soceidad club 4-1 in league play over the weekend. We saw players like Gonzalo Garcia, Vinicius Junior and Federico Valverde all find the scoresheet, and key player Kylian Mbappe was able to rest for this match. Mbappe flourishes under the big lights in a competition like this. Even though Benfica are strong and at home, I don't see Madrid slowing down, knowing they have the talent to bury this in the first leg.Back Mbappe to score the first goal in Benfica vs. Real Madrid at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get a first bet match up to $250 in bonus bets with promo code CBSSPORTS250BM:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to the Presidents' Day edition of the Pick Six newsletter!There has never been a Super Bowl on Presidents' Day weekend, but that will finally be changing next year. In 2027, not only will the NFL be giving us the first ever Valentine's Day Super Bowl, but the game will be happening on Presidents' Day weekend, so most people will have Monday off. I think what I'm trying to say here is that you might want to go ahead and start planning your Super Bowl party now, and yes, you should definitely go overboard. Presidents' Day is usually a pretty boring day in the NFL, but NOT TODAY, and that's thanks to the Miami Dolphins, who have decided to release both Bradley Chubb and Tyreek Hill. As always, here's your reminder to tell all your friends to sign up for the newsletter. All right, let's get to the rundown. 1. Dolphins make big moves: Miami set to release Tyreek Hill and Bradley Chubb\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Tyreek Hill and Bradley Chubb arriving in Miami together back in 2022, and now, they'll be leaving together. The Dolphins are expected to release both players.\nCBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones has reported that the Dolphins are planning to release Hill in a move that comes as no surprise. Hill doesn't have any guaranteed money left, but the Dolphins $16 million would have been guaranteed if he was on Miami's roster on the third day of the league year (March 14). Hill is 32 and coming off a devastating injury that includes a torn ACL, so it will be interesting to see what his market looks like in free agency. Here are three possible landing spots for Hill: Chiefs. A reunion with Patrick Mahomes in Kansas City would certainly make some sense. If Travis Kelce were to also return, this would basically be the Chiefs getting the band back together to make one more run at a Lombardi Trophy with offensive nucleus that helped Mahomes win his first title in 2019. Bills. If there's one thing the Bills are lacking on offense right now, it's definitely receivers. If Hill still has anything left in the tank, then he would be an instant upgrade over anything the Bills currently have on their roster. Chargers. With Keenan Allen set to hit free agency, the Chargers could bring in another aging veteran in Hill to take his place. And Hill's former head coach in Miami, Mike McDaniel, is now the offensive coordinator.As for Chubb, the Dolphins have decided to release the 29-year-old pass rusher, according to NFL Media. Chubb actually led the team with 8.5 sacks last season, so he can still get after the passer and considering his talents, there will be plenty of suitors for him in free agency. With that in mind, Jared Dubin came up with some possible landing spots for Chubb: \nBills. The Bills don't spend money on wide receivers, but Brandon Beane has historically been aggressive with pass rushers. Over the past four years alone, he's added Von Miller, Leonard Floyd and Joey Bosa. It wouldn't be surprising at all to see Beane make a play for Chubb. Bengals. The Bengals had one of the worst defenses in the NFL last season and to add insult to injury, they're likely going to lose two of their top pass rushers from 2025 (Trey Hendrickson and Joseph Ossai). The Bengals need to do something at pass rusher and although they could tag Hendrickson, it might be cheaper to just go out and sign Chubb. Eagles. The Eagles are always looking to add pass rusher and this one makes sense because it would reunited Chubb with Philadelphia defensive coordinator Vic Fangio. Chubb spent three seasons in Denver with Fangio, including a Pro Bowl season in 2020. 49ers. The 49ers had the fewest sacks in the NFL last year with 20 and they need to do anything they get some help in the pass-rushing department. Titans. Tennessee has more salary cap space than anyone, so if Chubb is chasing the biggest pay check, then the Titans would certainly make sense. Also, let's not forget, Robert Saleh is a defensive coach, so he'll certainly be looking for some game wreckers to add to his defense this year. Once Chubb and Hill are officially released, they won't have to wait until the start of free agency on March 11 to sign with a new team. Any player that gets cut before March 11 is allowed to sign with a new team as soon as their release is processed by the NFL. 2. Franchise tag window is opening this week: Looking at players who could possibly get taggedThe first big event of the NFL offseason will be here on Tuesday with the franchise tag window officially opening. Starting on Tuesday, each team will be allowed to use the franchise tag on one player (but they don't have to use it). Once a team uses a tag on a player, the two sides have until July to work out a long-term deal. If no deal is reached, then the player will get a fully guaranteed one-year contract in 2026 at the franchise tag number, which is different for each position. (This year, the current estimate is that the contract number will range from a low of $6.9 million for kickers to a high of $47.3 million for quarterbacks.)\nLast season, only two teams ended up using the tag (Kansas City and Cincinnati). This year, teams will have until March 3 to decide if they want to tag someone. So who's going to get tagged? Tyler Sullivan came up with a list of one franchise tag candidate for each team and we're going to check out three of those names below.Falcons TE Kyle Pitts (Tag number: $16.3 million). Pitts hasn't become the generational type of player the Falcons had hoped he'd be when they selected him with the fourth overall pick back in 2021. That said, he is coming off a career year in many respects, notching new highs in receptions and receiving touchdowns. Pitts made $10.8 million on his fifth-year option in 2025, and a $6 million bump under the franchise tag wouldn't be too crazy. Bengals: EDGE Trey Hendrickson ($30.2 million). Trey Hendrickson and the Bengals are seemingly in a never-ending contract dispute. For the past few offseasons, the two sides have been embroiled in a contract dispute that has included multiple trade requests, but to no avail. Last summer, they agreed to a restructured contract that set a maximum value of $30 million for 2025. While it seemed Hendrickson would leave Cincinnati, NFL Media reported on Super Bowl Sunday that the Bengals could end up tagging him.Colts: QB Daniel Jones ($47.3 million). Indy will be motivated to keep Jones around and see if he can rekindle that magic as he recovers from this injury, so the tag suddenly becomes a logical first step. The Colts could merely let Jones play out the year on the tag or use it as a placeholder until they hammer out a long-term deal. Either way, Jones seems destined to be tagged.To see Sullivan's full list of who might get hit with the franchise tag this year, be sure to click here.\n3. Mock Draft Monday: Ohio State lands four players in the top 10From now until the start of the NFL Draft, the first day of every week here will be known as Mock Draft Monday. What this means is that we'll be going through the latest mock draft from one of our NFL Draft gurus (Ryan Wilson, Josh Edwards or Mike Renner). With that in mind, here are the top 15 picks from Josh's latest mock: 1. Raiders: QB Fernando Mendoza (Indiana)2. Jets: EDGE David Bailey (Texas Tech)3. Cardinals: OT Spencer Fano (Utah)4. Titans: LB Arvell Reese (Ohio State)5. Giants: WR Carnell Tate (Ohio State)6. Browns: S Caleb Down (Ohio State)7. Commanders: EDGE Rueben Bain Jr. (Miami)8. Saints: LB Sonny Styles (Ohio State)9. Chiefs: RB Jeremiyah Love (Notre Dame) 10. Bengals: CB Mansoor Delane (LSU)11. Dolphins: CB Jermod McCoy (Tennessee)12. Cowboys: WR Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State)13. Rams (via Falcons): OT Francis Mauigoa (Miami)14. Ravens: IOL Olaivavega Ioane (Penn State)15. Buccaneers: EDGE Keldric Faulk (Auburn)As you can see, Josh has FOUR Ohio State players going in the top 10 and if that happens, it would be an NFL Draft record. The most players ever taken in the top 10 from the same school is three with the most recent occurrence coming in 2021 with Alabama. If you want to see how the full first round breaks down in Josh's latest mock draft, then be sure to check out the entire thing by clicking here. \nFor more draft coverage, you can hear in-depth analysis twice a week on \"With the First Pick\" -- our year-round NFL Draft podcast with NFL Draft analyst Ryan Wilson.

NFL offseason calendar: Here are the biggest dates you need to circle nowWith the franchise tag window opening Tuesday, I thought now would be a good time to rehash all the important dates on the NFL offseason calendar. Here are the key dates that will be happening over the next four weeks. Feb. 17: Franchise tag window opens. Starting at 4 p.m. ET, teams may designate the franchise tag or transition tag on players about to become free agents.Feb. 23-March 2: NFL Combine. Top prospects for the 2026 NFL Draft will descend on Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, where evaluators will get an initial look at how they stack up against the rest of the class.March 3: Tag window closes. Teams have until 4 p.m. ET to decide whether to deploy the franchise tag or transition tag.March 9-11: Legal tampering period. Beginning at 12 p.m. ET on March 9 and ending at 3:59:59 p.m. ET on March 11, teams may contact and enter contract negotiations with certified agents of players set to become unrestricted free agents at the start of the new league year.March 11: Free agency starts. Beginning at 4 p.m. ET, the 2026 League Year will officially be rung in, and with it, the start of free agency. The contracts for 2025 will have expired, which allows teams to officially ink free agents to new deals. Those are your key dates, but they're not the only key dates. The NFL's annual league meeting -- where most offseason rule changes get voted on -- will be taking place between March 29 and April 1. On April 6, any team with a new head coach will be allowed to begin their offseason workout program. \nYou know what? There are actually a lot of key dates to know and you can check them all out there. 5. Presidents' Day trivia: Drake Maye missed a chance to join an exclusive club\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Since today is Presidents' Day, it is the perfect day to point out that Drake Maye missed his shot at joining a very exclusive club. Only five colleges in the country have produced a Super Bowl-winning quarterback AND a president of the United States.Let's check out the full list: Miami (Ohio): Ben Roethlisberger -- Benjamin HarrisonStanford: John Elway/Jim Plunkett -- Herbert HooverMichigan: Tom Brady -- Gerald Ford Navy: Roger Staubach -- Jimmy Carter Delaware: Joe Flacco -- Joe Biden  If someone is near you right now, feel free to quiz the to see if they can name any of the five. \nAnyway, back to Drake Maye. If the Patriots had beaten the Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, then the University of North Carolina would also be on this list with Maye as the quarterback and James K. Polk as the president, but it wasn't meant to be. This year's Super Bowl-winning quarterback (Sam Darnold) went to USC, and surprisingly, that school has never produced a president, so our list will stay at five for at least another year. On a somewhat related note, only one school on this list -- and one school ever -- has produced a president, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback AND a Super Bowl-winning coach, and that school is Miami (Ohio). The school actually has three Super Bowl-winning coaches with Weeb Ewbank (Super Bowl III), John Harbaugh (Super Bowl XLVII) and Sean McVay (Super Bowl LVI). As a RedHawks graduate, I'm required to point this out whenever possible. I'm also required to point out that their basketball team is currently 25-0. \nOn that note, Happy Presidents' Day to all. 6. Extra points: Backstreet Boys want to do the Super Bowl halftime show It's been a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything, I put together a quick roundup for you.Backstreet Boys nominate themselves to do the Super Bowl halftime show. If the NFL hasn't decided on a halftime performer for Super Bowl LXI, the league might want to call the Backstreet Boys. Not only are they interested, but they said they would also invite Britney Spears and N*Sync to perform with them. With the Super Bowl being played on Valentine's Day next year, this might actually be the perfect halftime show. Raiders fill out their coaching staff. After less than a week on the job, Klint Kubiak has already hired his new offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator. On the offensive side of the ball, the Raiders have hired Andrew Janock, who was the QB coach in Seattle for the 2025 season. On the defensive side of the ball, the Raiders are promoting run game coordinator/defensive line coach Rob Leonard to defensive coordinator.  Seahawks find Klint Kubiak's replacement. With Kubiak in Las Vegas, the Seahawks were in need of an offensive coordinator and they filled the spot over the weekend by poaching Brian Fleury away from the 49ers. Fleury served as San Francisco's run game coordinator and tight ends coach in 2025 and had been with the team for seven season. You can read more about his hiring here. Jaguars have plan for Travis Hunter in 2026. It looks like Hunter might not be much of a two-way star next season. According to NFL Media, there's a good chance the Jaguars will be playing Hunter for on the defensive side of the ball at corner and cutting back on his offensive playing time. In seven games last season, Hunter played 486 snaps with 66.7% of that coming on offense. Hunter has a long injury history and tore his ACL in October, so letting him focus more on one side of the ball might be for the best. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Europe's best and brightest lay in wait, but for now, the Champions League is off on a little sojourn as the knockout play off round begins on Tuesday night. For those who missed the top eight, but not the 24, the next eight days offers a second chance to reach the round of 16, but with altogether less room for wobbles this time around.It was at this stage last year that big names such as Juventus, Milan and Manchester City fell and there will be a few big names intent on avoiding such slip ups this time around. Meanwhile the likes of Qarabag and Bodo/Glimt ready themselves for a first shot at the knockout stages of Europe's most prestigious competition.Before we get to them though, well, there's only one place you can begin. It's Jose Mourinho against one of his former employers. At whatever stage of whatever competition, that's pure box office.1. Can Jose Mourinho deliver another upset?\nNothing can erase the thrills of goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin rising highest at the death to deliver the header that Benfica had just discovered they needed if they were to avoid extend their participation in the Champions League. It was the sort of searing in or out drama that critics said the league phase's final day of 18 different cogs in the machine could not deliver. There is no way of eradicating European football's Jimmy Glass moment.\nIf there were to be one, though, it would probably involve Benfica discovering that the reward for their late win over Real Madrid was to be stomped into the dirt by Real Madrid a few weeks later. After all, Madrid are in so many ways the Michael Jordan of the soccer world. Something, anything happens and \"they took that personally.\" If you don't think that the Real Madrid hierarchy, coaching staff and players saw the joyous scenes at the Estadio da Luz and asked how it affects themselves, the main characters of this universe, then you don't know this club.Before we get to the matter of whether Madrid can inflict payback on Benfica it's probably worth asking what Mourinho can do to them. Let's start by assuming that we are not going to see the same approach from his team that we did in that final league stage game. That was one Benfica had to win to give themselves the best chance of reaching the knockouts. This time, well we've seen enough Mourinho knockout football to know that his basic approach still starts with whoever has the ball is the one that can make the mistakes. \"I'm very used to these kinds of ties,\" he said on Monday. \"I've been doing it all my life.\"There have been some signs in domestic football of Mourinho softening with age. His Benfica side average over two a goals a game in the Primeira Liga but like so much associated with his homeland -- from Viktor Gyokeres' scoring form to how good Porto were in early 2003 -- it's just very hard to realistically assess Mourinho's team in a competition with three near equals and an extremely limited field. Maybe we're better off looking at the limited data pool of the league phase. Looking at the chart below does at least give you a sense of what has been apparent to those who saw Benfica after Mourinho took charge on September 18. The trip to Newcastle aside this was a team who could at least stop the other team from really testing them, allowing only 10.1 non-penalty xG in their eight games. Given that, you'd be hard pressed to believe that Benfica are going to ride out to meet the team their manager calls the \"kings of the Champions League\" in single combat.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            The question then is whether Real Madrid can overwhelm the defenses. The answer is, yes, they probably can. It's not hard to make the case that appointing Alvaro Arbeloa lowered the ceiling that Xabi Alonso had built for this team in his brief tenure, the press and possess system that asked so much of his forwards replaced with something a little more up and down with fewer demands placed on the star forwards. Then again when you allow Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior to freelance the results can be pretty awe-inspiring, especially when it's an in-form Trent Alexander-Arnold getting the ball to them.The latter's presence could be an extremely powerful weapon if Benfica do as expected and sit off Madrid. No one in the sport can slide a cross through a low block like Alexander-Arnold, typified in his stunning cross for Gonzalo Garcia's opener in the 4-1 win over Real Sociedad. Even before his return to the team you could see that Madrid were on the upswing as an attacking force, a function of first Alonso abandoning his system amid player disgruntlement and his sacking effectively handing the reigns to the star players.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Given that this Madrid team will have a point to prove and the attack to eventually hammer down Benfica's defenses, you would be hard pressed to convince yourself of much Mourinho magic this time around. Then again, whoever would have seen Trubiin's late heroics last month?\n2. Are PSG able to peak at the right moment?Twelve months ago, you could see the first signs that something special was bubbling at the Parc des Princes, Paris Saint-Germain coalescing in such a fashion that in a flash they had established themselves as quite clearly the best team on the planet, bound for that Champions League title they had long craved. The only question coming into this season was whether the past few months had been the birth of a dynasty or the sort of magical union of form and fitness that no team could realistically expect to hold up for several years in a row.For most of 2025-26 it looks like the latter has been the more credible. Defeat at Rennes at the weekend saw the champions cede top spot in Ligue 1 to Lens. Meanwhile, two points from their final three league phase games saw Luis Enrique's men fritter away a top eight berth and slide into a second successive play off against French opposition. As the xG charts below show (ignore that hot form early in 2024-25, we're looking at a small data sample) there was a drop off at the start of this season, a serious upswing in the quality and quantity of shots being allowed resulting in a team that looked quite diminished compared to its all-conquering form.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            At least it was easy to explain why PSG had fallen off. After a gruelling summer of Club World Cup commitments, injuries hit hard. Joao Neves, Fabian Ruiz, Marquinhos, Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes all missed time at the start of the season as did Ousmane Dembele. The Ballon d'Or winner, reinvented from mercurial winger into ferocious leader of the pressing pack, was no less critical to the defensive excellence of the Champions League winners than the actual aforementioned defenders. The dip in their attacking oomph was also sustained from the final games of last season, many of which were more nervy than that rout of Inter in the final.\nIt was not just injuries that held back PSG. Luis Enrique seemed to do the same and that is not a critique. The coaching triumph of 2024-25 had been guiding his squad so that their fitness levels collectively peaked when Arsenal and Inter were on their last legs. If a few games had to be thrown early in the season to give his guys a post-Club World Cup breather, surely that would pay dividends in the spring?The signs are that that is indeed the case. Since the return of Dembele and Desire Doue, PSG's offensive output has swung upwards. The defense too has benefitted from more consistently selecting last season's back four. Strange results might still happen -- the 3-1 loss at Rennes saw PSG put up 3.58 xG and allow 1.39 -- but at full tilt this is still a team that should back itself to beat any in Europe.At full tilt is far from given and will require more than just Fabian Ruiz completing his return from a knee issue. It means their star players being fit and settled enough to excel rather than Dembele limping out with 16 minutes to go of the fightback at Rennes, a reminder that fragility has been the default for PSG's star attacker. It also means no more trading of barbs across post-match media from Dembele, who called on players to \"play for the club instead of thinking about themselves,\" and his seemingly less than impressed manager. Europe saw what this team looks like when tensions are frayed in the autumn of 2024. It certainly wasn't a Champions League winner in waiting.\nPSG can be that again and there are signs in the data to suggest they might be so soon. It may, however, require a level of collective fitness that, even with Luis Enrique's careful management, is far from normal at the business end of a season.3. Are Newcastle on upset watch?A final league table that wasn't a million miles away from a European football power rankings means that the playoff round has not thrown up any early showdowns between juggernauts, no re-run of last season's meeting between Real Madrid and Manchester City. That might mean this round lacks something of the high stakes tension that is the Champions League's stock trade in the spring months, but it does afford us the prospect of an upset or two.Galatasaray's meeting with Juventus might be one to keep an eye out on, though it is not entirely clear that any team that features Victor Osimhen and Leroy Sane should consider themselves long shots to win a two-legged tie early in this competition. The forecast in Bodo suggests that Inter will have even more to worry about than just Norway's finest.\nThe more intriguing left-field option might however be Newcastle United's trip to Azerbaijan. After all, Qarabag are seasoned veterans of two-legged European ties and have won eight of their last 10. Even when they haven't emerged victorious they've pushed big beasts like near-invincible Bayer Leverkusen all the way. In this season's league phase only Ajax departed Baku victorious and Chelsea were made to pay the price for Enzo Maresca's rotation in a 2-2 draw where Qarabag might have hoped for more.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            There'll be questions of rotation and resource allocation for Eddie Howe to consider on the 5,000 mile round trip to a city that is nearer to Delhi than Newcastle. That's a long journey to recover from by 3 p.m. ET on Saturday, when Newcastle are due at Manchester City, trying to stay in the hunt for qualification to next year's European competitions. Following the news that star player Bruno Guimaraes would miss up to two months with a hamstring injury, Sven Botman and Yoanne Wissa missed the FA Cup fourth round tie against Aston Villa, propelling the Magpies' injury list to eight players. Now even without all those players they were able to win well at Villa Park and any team that rolls out the likes of Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon should be favorites against Qarabag. Still this might prove to be a fiddlier first leg than it looks, potentially setting the stage for a nerve-wracking night at St. James' Park next week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the preliminary round of the men's hockey tournament at the 2026 Winter Olympics is complete, the playoff round is about to begin. And as expected with NHL players participating in the Winter Games for the first time since 2014, Canada and the United States are the cream of the crop in the sport.The two superpowers were the only teams to win all three of their round-robin games and received a bye, along with Slovakia and defending Olympic champions Finland, to the quarterfinals. Their opponents will be determined on Tuesday when the remaining eight nations compete in the qualification round.Top seed Canada will face the winner of the matchup between Czechia and Denmark, while a meeting with No. 2 seed Team USA is on the line when Sweden takes on Latvia. No. 3 Slovakia will battle either Germany or France, and No. 4 Finland awaits the survivor of the showdown between Switzerland and Italy.The qualification winners will have little time to recover as the quarterfinals take place Wednesday. The semifinals are scheduled for Friday, with the losers facing off for the bronze medal the following day and the winners playing for gold on Sunday.Teams will be reseeded after the quarterfinals based on the preliminary round rankings, meaning Canada and the U.S. won't clash until a medal is at stake, if at all. Considering how they breezed through their round-robin contests, it's very likely they'll be squaring off for gold.Canada is the overwhelming favorite to claim its record 10th Olympic gold medal and first since 2014 as it is priced at -140 at most major sportsbooks. Team USA is listed between +195 and +220, while no other team is priced below +1000.Below are my predictions for medals in the 2026 Winter Olympics men's hockey tournament, as well as the teams' current odds to earn a spot on the podium at DraftKings Sportsbook.

Widely regarded as the best player on the planet, Connor McDavid has not disappointed in his first Olympics as he leads the tournament with nine points. The 29-year-old captain of the Edmonton Oilers has more assists (seven) than any other player has points (six). Teammates Sidney Crosby and Macklin Celebrini both have recorded six points, along with Slovakia's Juraj Slafkovsky, while the 19-year-old Celebrini is tied with Germany's Tim Stutzle for first in the Winter Games with four goals. Crosby and defenseman Drew Doughty helped Canada win gold in 2010 and 2014 while goaltender Jordan Binnington backstopped the club to the 4 Nations Face-Off title last year. Binnington, who guided the St. Louis Blues to the Stanley Cup championship as a rookie in 2019, won both of his starts in these Olympics - including a 26-save shutout against Czechia, the Canadians' potential opponent in the quarterfinals. Canada is -140 to win the gold medal at DraftKings, and the team hasn't given me a reason to expect anything less.Get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel Sportsbook for Winter Olympics betting:Silver - United States (-350 to win a medal)Team USA also went undefeated in the preliminary round but didn't do so as convincingly as Canada. The Americans faced a bit of a scare in their 6-3 victory against Denmark as they trailed by a goal after one period and led by just one after 40 minutes. Captain Auston Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk have registered five points apiece for the U.S., with the former leading the club with three goals and all of the latter's points being assists. Three-time Vezina Trophy winner and reigning Hart Trophy recipient Connor Hellebuyck has turned aside 40 of the 42 shots he faced in these Winter Games but will be in for his toughest test yet if Sweden defeats Latvia in the qualification round as expected. Team USA would then have to record one more victory before a potential showdown with Canada for the gold medal and I just don't see it getting past McDavid, Crosby and company for its first Olympic title since 1980.Bronze - Finland (-155 to win a medal)Finland has one of the most balanced rosters in the Winter Games. All but two of Finland's 22 skaters have recorded a point in the tournament, and neither of them appeared in all three games. Eleven players have scored at least one goal and there's a four-way tie for the team lead of four points. Kaapo Kakko and Joel Armia each have netted two tallies and set up two others, while Sebastian Aho, Mikael Granlund and Joel Kiviranta also have scored twice. Juuse Saros has played every minute in goal for the Finns and has allowed a total of one goal over his last two outings. Finland's quarterfinal opponent will likely be Switzerland, which should get past an Italian squad that gave Slovakia a tough time in the preliminary round but was demolished 11-0 by the Finns in its last contest. The Finns were upset 4-1 by the Slovakians in their Olympic opener, which cost them the top seed in their group, but rebounded by defeating Sweden by the same score and trouncing Italy. Sweden and Czechia will meet the two juggernauts should they advance to the quarterfinals and while it's not out of the realm of possibility that the Swedes upset the Americans, I believe Finland and Slovakia join Canada and the U.S. in the semifinals and ultimately battle for the bronze. I'd give Saros the edge over Samuel Hlavaj in goal, meaning the Finns medal for the seventh time in the last nine Winter Olympics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Two months from now, when Cathy Engelbert walks to the podium to announce the No. 1 pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft, she may call Azzi Fudd's name. At the very least, Fudd is set to become the latest UConn star selected in the lottery. Fudd arrived in Storrs in 2021 as the No. 1 overall recruit in her class, but has not had an easy road to this point. She suffered a devastating knee injury during high school that required multiple surgeries to repair a torn ACL and MCL in her right knee, then played just 42 games in her first three seasons at UConn due to an array of injuries, including another torn ACL in her right knee. Over the last two seasons, Fudd has finally gotten healthy, which has allowed her to show why she was so highly regarded as a prospect. She was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player last season after helping the Huskies win their first national championship since 2016, then decided to use her extra year of eligibility to return to school and further develop her game. Through 27 appearances this season, Fudd is averaging 17.8 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.4 steals on 49.5/46.3/94.9 shooting splits for the 27-0 Huskies, who are ranked No. 1 in the country and have a real chance to pull off another undefeated season. \nAfter 14 consecutive wins by at least 30 points, the Huskies ran into a bit of trouble on Saturday afternoon in front of a sold-out crowd at the Al McGuire Center on Marquette's campus. The Golden Eagles jumped in front early, and the game was tied in the middle of the second quarter. Fudd, who finished with a game-high 25 points and four steals, helped lead a 16-4 run to close the half, however, and the Huskies held on for a 71-56 win -- their third-closest contest this season. I was lucky enough to sit courtside for the Valentine's Day matchup, and spent the afternoon focused solely on Fudd, who didn't come out until 2:30 remaining, when the game was finally in hand. Here are my observations from watching one of the top prospects in this year's draft class from a unique vantage point. DefenseFudd is largely discussed as an offensive prospect, and for good reason, but the biggest thing that stood out from watching her in person was her defense, particularly off the ball. \nUConn was switching just about everything in the halfcourt, and Fudd often made sure she took whoever was in the weakside corner. That allowed her to remain on the backline and act as a roamer to help shut off the middle of the floor. She was excellent in this role. She was constantly scanning the floor and talking to her teammates. Her awareness of what was happening in front of her, and her timing on when to help, was almost always on point. Time and again, Fudd was in the right place to deny a pass, force a more difficult shot or create a turnover. \nBecause of UConn's switching tactic, there were times Fudd found herself matched up against bigger players, such as Halle Vice or Skylar Forbes. She never shrank from the challenge. While the 5-foot-11 Fudd isn't the biggest guard, she's not small either. Most importantly, she's willing to fight in those situations when she has to, and smart enough to know when she should get out of there. \nOne possession in the third quarter stood out, when Fudd got switched onto the 6-foot-3 Forbes, who tried to bury her in the post. Fudd fought to get in front of her and denied an easy entry pass. As Vice hesitated and swung the ball to the opposite wing, Fudd immediately yelled \"Sarah! Sarah!\" and coordinated a switch with Sarah Strong. Fudd scrammed out to the wing with high hands, which forced Kennedi Perkins to throw something of a lob down into Forbes. Strong was able to read the pass and pick it off. \nFundamentals are often an offensive conversation, but Fudd was so sound defensively. She constantly had her head on a swivel and played with active hands. Even something as basic as the way she slid her feet in UConn's full-court press was flawless. Fudd finished with four steals, one short of her season-high, and took two of them coast-to-coast for layups. \n\"She's putting herself in positions to do that, as opposed to previous years, I think she was very cautious. She played the game cautiously on defense,\" Geno Auriemma said after the game. \"If I would say there's one thing that I'm glad we're seeing, is her ability off the ball to be in the right spot at the right time and to have the confidence to go for it and not worry about what happens if I'm not successful. It's been like that all year, and it's great when you have someone that's that kind of offensive player that's willing to play like that on the other end.\"ShootingFudd's shooting prowess is no secret. She's a 42.3% career 3-point shooter and is making a career-high 46.3% of her attempts this season. Fudd's textbook form is a big part of her success. Pre-game warm-ups provided an opportunity to watch her release over and over in a less chaotic environment than a game, and it was incredible to see up close. Here are a few stills from a video I shot. It doesn't get better than this. \nFudd's perfect form It was also interesting to see how repeatable Fudd's shot was. It looks the same every single time, which is a testament to the work that she's put in, and really translates to game action. Of course, Fudd's lightning-quick release is another aspect of her success. It's one thing to watch on TV, it was another to see it in person from courtside. The speed with which she's able to catch, square herself and fire -- again, with the same, perfect form every time -- is really remarkable. The dismay from Marquette on a few of her 3s was palpable. Finally, it was fun to watch Fudd read and react to the defense. She did a great job of using screens and relocating to create space for herself. Her first 3 of the day was a perfect example. She faked a cut toward the basket, which got Jordan Meulemans to take one step the wrong way, then sprinted into a hand-off with Jana El Alfy. Instead of curling around El Alfy, she stopped right behind her and was wide open. \nOn-ball creationIf there's a clear area of improvement for Fudd, it's her on-ball creation. She is one of the best shooting prospects of all time, but remains largely an off-ball threat. Against Marquette, Fudd did not initiate UConn's offense except on occasion in transition. She generally started in the corner and utilized screens and cuts to get open. While she was willing to put the ball on the deck when the Golden Eagles ran her off the line, she was almost exclusively looking for one- or two-dribble pull-ups. Her form remains impeccable on those attempts, but she's clearly not as comfortable shooting off the dribble. Against Marquette, she was 2 of 7 on pull-up 2s and 0 of 2 on pull-up 3s. \n\"Definitely something I could have been better at today,\" Fudd said about her self-created offense after the win. Notably, Fudd finished with zero assists, and on two of the rare times she went to the basket in the halfcourt, she was rejected by Forbes. Though still an excellent lateral athlete despite the knee injuries, Fudd isn't an explosive vertical athlete and often tried to finish with underhand scoop layups. Fan reactionFinally, just a note about the incredible fan support Fudd and UConn received. When I arrived a few hours before tip-off, there were already hundreds of fans lined up waiting to get in, most of them sporting UConn gear. There were plenty of Fudd jerseys and shirts, and multiple \"Fudd Around and Find Out\" signs. Again, the game was in Milwaukee, not Storrs. \nPost-game, when Fudd sat at the announcer's table doing an interview with FS1, dozens of fans immediately flocked to that side of the bleachers just to take pictures and selfies in her presence. When she eventually walked to the locker room, the screams were deafening. UConn and Fudd's popularity is not a surprise at this point, but Saturday's game felt different from even their previous trips to Milwaukee. Whichever team drafts Fudd be acquiring a massive fanbase in addition to a great player. \n            ",

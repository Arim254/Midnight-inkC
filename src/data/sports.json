The Over is 9-3 for the Nuggets over their last dozen road games, and it has hit in five of their last seven games overall. The latter also goes for Philly over its last seven, with the Over having a 5-2 record.Philadelphia is a double-digit favorite, and the Sixers have frequently engaged in high-scoring games when favored by any amount.

    "body": "\n        After a six-season run during which he accumulated a 44-56 record, Kevin Stefanski was fired on Monday by the Cleveland Browns. \"We appreciate all [Stefanski's] hard work and dedication to our organization but our results over the last two seasons have not been satisfactory, and we believe a change at the head coaching position is necessary,\" Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam wrote in a statement.Stefanski was a two-time Coach of the Year with the Browns, having won 11 games in both 2020 and 2023. In 2020 he led the team to its first playoff appearance in 18 years and its first playoff win in 23 years. In 2023 the Browns made the playoffs again but lost in the first round. But the team went just 3-14 and 5-12 over the last two seasons, leading the Haslams and general manager Andrew Berry to make a change.\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top two picks as other teams miss out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBerry will remain in his post as general manager and lead the search for Stefanski's replacement. Here are some candidates the Browns could look at, with most of them being first-time head coaches, as CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports that the search will likely yield another first-time coach.Jesse Minter (Chargers DC)Minter is arguably the top candidate on the market this offseason so it may be difficult for Cleveland to land him given its generally unstable (in terms of process) ownership and management situation, but that doesn't mean the Browns shouldn't try. Minter is one of the premier defensive schemers in the league and he could figure out the best way to utilize Myles Garrett, who will be coming off a Defensive Player of the Year season. Like the other defensive-minded coaches on this list, Minter would have to have a good plan for what he's going to do at offensive coordinator, though it remains to be seen what kind of talent he'd be working with on that side of the ball, and whether the Browns will be pursuing an upgrade at quarterback. \nMatt Burke (Texans DC)Burke spent the first five years of his NFL career working under current Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, then worked with him again for a couple years in Philadelphia. Schwartz turned his unit into one of the best in football over the last few years, so the Browns could be tempted to keep the good times rolling on that side of the ball by going with a younger version of the coach who has been coordinating a top unit. He may even want to keep Schwartz as the DC if he comes aboard. Burke calls the plays for the Texans' defense despite the presence of DeMeco Ryans as head coach, and we've seen that he can call a top defense himself. Jeff Hafley (Packers DC)Hafley, like Minter and Burke, is considered one of the top defensive minds in the sport. His Green Bay defenses have been excellent when healthy and he is considered a rising star in the league. He's going to be in the mix for multiple jobs this cycle and might not consider the Cleveland job to be the most desirable because of the aforementioned issues, but if the Browns could land him, they could maintain their excellent defense. He'd have to have a strong plan at offensive coordinator, as mentioned for Minter, and that's not just a secondary consideration when it comes to hiring defensive-minded head coaches -- it's really important. Hafley would be a hire in the mold of the Seahawks' Mike Macdonald, and we've seen that Seattle needed a new OC to really take off this season. Speaking of that new OC...Klint Kubiak (Seahawks OC)The Browns have hired an offensive-minded head coach each of the last three times they've been in position to hire a new one, and Kubiak is considered one of the top offensive candidates this cycle. His offense puts quarterbacks in position to succeed, as we've seen this year with Sam Darnold, and any connection to the Kyle Shanahan/Sean McVay-style offense is always desirable in head-coaching searches, as we have seen over the last decade or so. Kubiak would be a hire in the mold of Stefanski (who had previously been the Vikings' quarterbacks coach and then offensive coordinator before he headed to Cleveland), but the Browns have shown an affinity for bringing in offensive coordinators from top offenses before.\nMike McCarthy (Former Cowboys and Packers HC)The lone retread on this list, McCarthy interviewed for the Browns job back in 2020 before ultimately landing in Dallas. He's had a lot of regular season success and generally tends to get the best out of his quarterbacks, though he's had the good fortune of coaching Aaron Rodgers and Dak Prescott during his tenures in Green Bay and Dallas, and he wouldn't be walking into a similar situation in Cleveland. McCarthy has his faults but he is respected around the league and would give the Browns an air of professionalism, though he may also give them a defined ceiling considering his limitations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 College Football Playoff has already provided some unexpected twists and turns, most notably with No. 10 seed Miami pulling an upset of No. 2 seed Ohio State in the quarterfinals. The Hurricanes' stunning dominance of the reigning national champions messed up a lot of brackets.On the same side of the bracket, No. 6 seed Ole Miss taking down No. 3 seed Georgia has left us with a Fiesta Bowl matchup between the Rebels and Miami that few would have predicted. Whoever wins that game will take on either No. 1 seed Indiana or No. 5 seed Oregon after the Big Ten foes square off in the Peach Bowl.The top-seeded Hoosiers were the only team with a bye to survive the quarterfinals. Now that the chaos of the first two rounds is behind us, our experts are recalibrating and issuing new predictions for how things will play out from here. With just three CFP games remaining before a champion is crowned, here are our best takes on what's likely in store.2025-26 College Football Playoff bracket picksTom FornelliI did not think Miami had a legit shot at a national title, even after beating Texas A&M, because the path felt unrealistic. Then the 'Canes beat Ohio State and Georgia lost. Now the door looks open, and while Indiana took the belt to Alabama, its offensive line struggled a bit in pass protection -- much like it did against Ohio State. Well, Miami's pass rush is pretty good, and the defense as a whole is currently playing like the '85 Bears. Indiana has been the best team all season, but Miami feels like the best team right now. \nChip PattersonWe have four head coaches who have never won a national championship at the FBS level, but we do have one who has been a consistent winner at every level. The Parity Playoff, ringing in the era of the New Bloods, seems ripe to be won by Curt Cignetti and his band of misfits that have simply out-played and out-executed all of the big-brand monsters put in their way. Beating Oregon for a second time and then a Miami team with a game-wrecking defensive front will be perhaps the biggest challenges of the season, but the level of consistency all season long is too hard to ignore when projecting out the final three games of the season.John TaltyIndiana has been the best team all season. At every step, the Hoosiers have proven themselves worthy of winning it all. Indiana has already beaten Oregon once this season and will do it again in Atlanta. I love Ole Miss' story and think the magic continues for one more round into the national championship. But, ultimately, I trust Indiana's elite combination of offense and defense over the remaining teams in the field. As insane as it would have sounded a few years ago to write these words, I believe Curt Cignetti will win a national championship at Indiana this season. Brandon MarcelloI'm not hedging when I say any of these four teams remaining in the semifinals can win the national championship. No team is head and shoulders above the others, unlike in previous years. And thank goodness for that! Miami is the most physical team in the field and is playing better than probably every other team not named Indiana, but the matchup with Ole Miss is a monster. The Rebels can score against anybody, it seems, and though Rueben Bain and Akheem Mesidor are the two best pass rushers remaining in the playoff (and they're on the same team!), I can't discount the legendary gamer mentality that quarterback Trindiad Chambliss has shown all season. Even with that incredible defense, Miami may need to score four touchdowns to win, and the Hurricanes have not yet done that in the postseason. \nMeanwhile, the Peach Bowl gives me pause because of an old -- but true -- adage: it's difficult beating the same team twice. Still, Indiana knocked off Oregon on the road by double digits in the regular season despite Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza throwing a pick six. I'll take Ole Miss and Indiana in the national championship with Mendoza returning home to South Florida and delivering the Hoosiers a national title.Shehan JeyarajahThe Hoosiers have been on a mission from the outset of the season. No team is better across the board, from trench play to downfield passing. A rematch with Oregon could get a little squirrelly, but Fernando Mendoza will make enough plays to get by. Miami's defensive line will cause major headaches for Ole Miss and end their magical run, but the Hoosiers have enough beef up front to counter. Believe in miracles: Indiana will win the national championship. Chris HummerIf there's anything I've learned from the first few rounds of the playoffs it's that elite line of scrimmage play matters. That's what Oregon and Miami have in common. I don't like picking against Indiana. But it's really hard to beat a great team twice, and that's what the Ducks are. Miami, for its part, just has a major advantage in the trenches against Ole Miss. As for the national title matchup of two huge brands separated by an entire country, I like Oregon. Mario Cristobal is very familiar with that roster, and I think the Ducks have the o-line and QB to combat what Miami does really well. Oregon is the more explosive team. That makes the difference.\nDavid CobbIndiana imposed its will on Alabama in all phases during its 38-3 Rose Bowl romp. Meanwhile, Oregon's offense looked a bit sloppy and disorganized in a 23-0 Orange Bowl win over Texas Tech. Additionally, we've already seen IU beat Oregon 30-20 on the road this season. The Hoosiers are the most complete team in college football and have proved that multiple times. Regardless of who it might face in the national championship game, this Indiana team should win it all.. Brad CrawfordIndiana's a well-oiled machine that does everything well with a Heisman quarterback at the helm and coach whose ruthless preparation and extreme confidence is reflected by his team's execution level. Two more wins is all that stands between Indiana becoming college football's first 16-0 team of the playoff era and cementing itself alongside the sport's all-time greatest national champions. With that, Curt Cignetti secures one of the most impressive coaching jobs across an entire season in history -- a couple fourth-quarter comebacks, a Big Ten title triumph, a resounding 35-point Rose Bowl win over a perceived titan and a championship trophy.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The juiced-up DraftKings promo code now gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, and although there's no football to wager on today, the model still finds value in some of the NBA's top matchups for online sports betting. Arguably, the game of the day in the NBA is the Detroit Pistons hosting the New York Knicks in a matchup of the two teams with the best records in the Eastern Conference. Despite the Pistons being home and having a better record, the SportsLine advanced computer model is backing the Knicks as 2.5-point favorites as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.The model is also backing the Clippers to defeat the Warriors. One of SportsLine's top experts also has an NHL pick on the New York Rangers vs. Utah Mammoth on Monday. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 12 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 33-15 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season.

Josh Hart (ankle) and Landry Shamet (shoulder) remain out for the Knicks, but no Karl-Anthony Towns or Mitchell Robinson on the injury report is promising. The Knicks have the No. 4 scoring offense (120.6 points per game this season). New York defeated the Pistons in six games in the playoffs last year, including going 3-0 and clinching the series in Detroit, so the road environment shouldn't be an issue on Monday.

The Russian has helped New York on a 6-1-1 run, and after winning the Winter Classic in Miami, he has one or fewer goals in eight games this season, tied for fourth-most in the league.\" Back the Rangers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers (-102) vs. WarriorsThe Clippers are coming off a bad 146-115 loss to the Celtics on Saturday, but they had a six-game winning streak before that contest, including victories over the Pistons, Lakers and Rockets. The Clippers have rebounded from their awful start to give themselves a chance at competing for an NBA Play-In tournament spot if they keep playing as they have over the last few weeks. The Clippers are just 12-22 this season, but they are home on Monday, and they've gone 5-1 over their last six home games. James Harden and Kawhi Leonard still make a top duo in the league for Los Angeles, and Leonard is averaging 38.8 ppg over his last four contests. The Warriors are 2-3 over their last five road games, and 8-12 away on the season. The model projects the Clippers to win in 64% of simulations, showcasing strong value at near even-money odds. Back the Clippers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, NHL picks for Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Spring training camps open in five weeks and, before you know it, Cactus League and Grapefruit League games will begin. The top four free agents and 17 of the top 50 free agents remain unsigned, meaning there is a lot of hot stove activity to come between now and the start of camp. Here now are Monday's rumors and happenings.  \tYankees make second offer to Bellinger \nThe Yankees have made a second offer to free-agent outfielder Cody Bellinger, reports the New York Post. They reportedly made an initial offer last week, though the numbers have not been made public. GM Brian Cashman has made it clear retaining Bellinger, who had a 4.9 WAR season with New York in 2025, is the team's top priority. We ranked Bellinger as the sixth-best free agent available this offseason. The Yankees are also reportedly discussing righty Edward Cabrera with the Marlins, and a Cabrera trade could be tied to a Bellinger re-signing (and vice versa). Re-signing Bellinger would allow the Yankees to more easily include erstwhile top prospect Jasson Domínguez in a trade for a pitcher, Cabrera or otherwise.  Peralta talks expected to resume \nTrade talks involving Brewers ace Freddy Peralta are expected to resume in earnest now that the holidays are in the rear-view mirror, reports The Athletic. The Braves, Dodgers, Mets, Red Sox, and Yankees are among the teams with interest. Peralta's $8 million salary in 2026 makes him affordable for any team. We ranked him as one of the offseason's top trade candidates. \nThe Brewers have a recent history of trading their best players a year before free agency (Corbin Burnes, Devin Williams, etc.) and that's where Peralta is right now. The asking price figures to be quite high given Peralta's effectiveness, his durability, and his low salary. To some teams, trading for Peralta could be more appealing than signing one of the top free-agent starters. Pirates interested in Suárez \nThe Pirates want to add more offense and have interest in free-agent third baseman Eugenio Suárez, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The club has already added Brandon Lowe and Ryan O'Hearn to a lineup that scored the fewest runs in baseball last year and hit the fewest homers than any team has hit in three years. We ranked Suárez as the 14th-best free agent this winter. At the moment, Pittsburgh's top third-base option is gloveman Jared Triolo, and the middle of their lineup leans lefty-heavy with Lowe, Oneil Cruz, and Spencer Horwitz. Suárez would be a significant upgrade at the hot corner and bring needed righty power. The Pirates reportedly offered Kyle Schwarber more than $100 million, which could be good news for Suárez and his wallet.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     \tPhillies hire Mattingly As expected, the Phillies have hired Don Mattingly as their new bench coach, the team announced Monday. Mattingly's contract with the Blue Jays expired at the end of the calendar year. He's still searching for that elusive World Series title after coming so close last season.\"I am excited to welcome Don Mattingly to Philadelphia. Having known Don for years and having worked  closely with him in New  York, I know that his knowledge of the game and his character make him a  great addition to our tremendous coaching staff,\" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said in a statement. Mattingly, 64, spent the last three seasons as Toronto's bench coach. He and Thomson overlapped for years with the Yankees. Mattingly's son, Preston, is Philadelphia's general manager under president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the process of handing No. 10 Iowa State its first loss of the season Sunday afternoon, No. 22 Baylor and Bears coach Nicki Collen may have given the rest of the country a blueprint on how to slow down Naismith Player of the Year candidate Audi Crooks. The game log will show that Baylor's Taliah Scott, who scored all of her 21 points in the second half, sank a last-second jumper to complete the Bears' 72-70 upset win over the Cyclones (14-1) in Ames, Iowa, but the plan and execution regarding how to handle Crooks is what set the table for the stunning result.Prior to the game, Collen joked that Baylor (13-3) would need supernatural help to defend Crooks, who entered Sunday as the leading scorer in the nation at 29.4 points per game on a historic 72.5% shooting. In NCAA Division I women's basketball history (which officially dates back to 1981-82), there have been 24 previous instances of a player averaging at least 29 points per game, per Stathead. None of them have shot above 60.1%. Crooks has largely been unstoppable this season thanks to her rolodex of post moves, deft footwork and unique frame. She already has three 40-point outings, including a career-high 47 points against Indiana, and hasn't shot worse than 57.1% in any game. \nEarly against Baylor, it was more of the same. Crooks, allowed to play one-on-one, scored Iowa State's first nine points with ease, and had 14 points on a perfect 6-6 from the field in the first quarter. By the end of the first half, she was up to 22 points on 9 of 11, and one of those misses was a rare 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer. \nCrooks' productive second quarter overshadowed the fact that Baylor had started to change their defensive gameplan. In the middle of the frame, there were multiple possessions where Jada Williams' defender sank into the paint to front Crooks and prevent the Cyclones from getting her the ball. \nThat foreshadowed the Bears' even more drastic approach in the fourth quarter, when they refused to let Crooks impact the game. Once again, the Bears ignored Williams (Reese Beaty briefly got the same treatment when she was in the game for Williams) so they could have two defenders sandwich Crooks in the post. While Williams is a strong playmaker -- team-high 7.2 assists per game -- she entered Sunday shooting just 39.7% from the field, including 26.7% from 3-point range. \n\"One of the guards was just sitting in front of me the whole time, and the other girl that was actually guarding me was behind me,\" Crooks said. \"It made it really, really hard for the guards to make post-entry passes because they were also both I think at least 6-foot with ups, so that makes it difficult to get it inside. It was a good defensive plan by Baylor.\"Even late in the fourth, the Bears were content to let Williams walk into 15-footers rather than let Crooks get involved. \nCrooks went scoreless in the fourth quarter, and her two shot attempts were a rushed fadeaway the one time she got a post touch and a putback from an offensive rebound that got blocked. As a team, the Cyclones managed just 14 points on 6 of 17 from the field, as the Bears completed the comeback victory. \n\"Obviously made it hard to get Audi the ball,\" Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly said after the game. \"At the end of the day, it's hard to beat a really good team playing two against five, and that's basically what it came down to today,\"Crooks finished with 26 points on 11 of 20 from the field, but just four of them came in the second half. Williams, meanwhile, had 28 points on 11 of 28 shooting, including 6 of 17 from 3-point range -- all of those marks were career-highs for the junior guard. Every other Iowa State player combined for 16 points on 5 of 23. Throughout Crooks' dominant start to the season, there has been plenty of chatter about why opponents have not sent more double teams her way. The obvious answer has been Iowa State's elite 3-point shooting. The Cyclones entered Sunday shooting 38.2% from behind the arc as a team, which ranked 14th in the country, and three of their starters -- Mackenzie Hare, Arianna Jackson and Addy Brown -- were shooting 43.2% or better.\nThe Cyclones' spacing in their four-out offense makes it difficult to properly execute a double without giving up an open shot, but it has still been surprising that opposing coaches have not attempted to take the ball out of Crooks' hands more often. Collen and the Bears took that idea one step further. You don't have to worry about how to get the ball out of her hands if she never has it in the first place. Plus, by ignoring Williams and face-guarding the Cyclones' elite 3-point threats, the Bears exerted more control over who had the ball and was forced to shoot instead of Crooks. \"We had to find a way to take Crooks away, and so we obviously made the decision to let Jada Williams shoot,\" Collen said after the game. \"Sometimes it looks crazy, because she obviously made some, but at the end of the day, when you look at the analytics, and Crooks shoots 70%, and Jackson and Hare shoot 50% from 3, we had to pick our poison. I thought we executed that at a high level.\"\nCollen's bold and daring strategy helped her team pick up its biggest win of the season, and showed that it's possible to slow down Crooks -- even without supernatural help. Was this a one-off success that caught Iowa State off-guard, or will their upcoming opponents take a page out of Baylor's book. And if they do, how will the Cyclones respond?Connelly doesn't expect to wait long to find out. \"We'll probably see it Wednesday,\" he said, when his team travels to Ohio to take on Cincinnati. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Through his first two years in the league, Keyonte George was looking like anything but a foundational guy for the Utah Jazz. He was a sub-40% shooter -- a prime candidate for the dreaded no-defense/volume-scorer tag, a death knell for a modern starting point guard. Fast forward to January 2026, and George, who has been on an absolute heater of late, has a real-deal All-Star case and should, for my money, be the co-favorite alongside Deni Avdija for Most Improved Player (George, +500 at DraftKings, currently has the third-shortest odds for the honor). His numbers from Year 2 to Year 3 hardly look like the same player. SEASONPPGAPGPTS/100 SHOTSTS%2024-2516.85.6108.953.92025-2624.66.8122.461.3Yes, the usage rate and shot attempts are up. But this isn't just a volume leap. It's an efficiency one. For the month of December, George averaged 27.7 PPG on 64.9% true-shooting. Over his last 10 games, he's at 28.9 PPG on 44% from 3. George, drafted 16th overall in 2023, is also getting to the free-throw line almost twice as often as he did last year, up to almost eight attempts a game, and he's making 90% of them, up from 81%. When you add that kind of free-throw volume and also jump into the Stephen Curry land of percentage, you're an entirely different player on that alone. \nGeorge is just flat out harder to guard now. He's always had gears equal parts shifty and smooth, but his first step is so efficient now and his handle has gotten visibly tighter, and he uses it to separate from defenders who now have to press up on him in a way that his improved shooting clips command. Jordan Walsh guards the best of the best for Boston and here George goes right by him to the rim, where this season he's converting at a 71% clip (identical to Anthony Edwards), per Cleaning the Glass, up from 61% a year ago. George is a smooth left-handed finisher, and contact doesn't bother him; in fact, he's becoming adept at seeking it, which is why his free throws are so up. If you just give him a little bump, he's going through it.George's 3-point volume hasn't changed (7.2 attempts per game, negligibly down from 7.6 last year), he's just making a lot more of them at 38% (up from 34%). Same story, for the most part, at the rim: Efficiency up, frequency roughly the same. Where he's both taking and making more shots is in the midrange. Last season, George took 4.6 shots per game from somewhere between the restricted circle and the 3-point line, per NBA tracking. This season that number is up to 7.8, and he's making these shots at a 45% clip, up from 39% last year, per CTG. George is generally getting to these spots courtesy of some kind of two-man action, very often with Jusuf Nurkić, who has assisted George on 31 buckets (second-most on the team) and has been extremely useful operating as a high-post hub. If you squint you can see some of the same chemistry between George and Nurkić that has made Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray the best two-man partnership going in the NBA. Nurkić obviously isn't on Jokić's level, but he's a similar player in terms of skillset and schematic positioning. Meanwhile, Murray, for my money, is about the best George comp you'll find right now. Two electric, three-level shotmakers who work their two-man tandems like it's in their DNA. There's a clockwork choreography to the George/Nurkić handoffs. This happens over and over with George coming off for clean jumpers and downhill attacks. But here's where it gets fun. As soon as defenders start anticipating that over-the-top action and try to beat George to the spot, he plants on a dime and goes the other way and Nurkić is right there on the same page.Here Ausar Thompson, one of the best perimeter defenders in the league, assumes a handoff is coming and is positioning himself high to take it away. So George cuts low. \nSame thing here against Boston:This time Devin Vassell gets caught:Next up, it's Duncan Robinson assuming George is going over the top on what looks like another standard handoff only to watch helplessly as he instead hits the brakes and reverses direction for an open 3. \nGeorge's chemistry with Nurkić translates off the ball, too. Here the great Derrick White has his antenna up for George to continue toward the ball in the flow of this weave for another handoff from Lauri Markkanen, but instead Nurkić is on the spot with a flare screen as George goes the other way into open space. Bang. That shot right there has changed George's scoring profile more than anything else. He's a great pick-and-roll player but his ability to also wreak havoc off ball as an intuitive mover and deadly marksman makes him different than, say, Trae Young (or Monta Ellis, for those of you who can go back a bit farther in the scoring-guard annals, both of whom we'll talk about in a minute). This season George is scoring 1.22 PPP on all catch-and-shoots and hitting 53.7% of his spot-up 3s, per Synergy, up from a 1.06 and 35% a year ago. And he's not just making all these shots in meaningless moments. For starters, the Jazz are a competitive team; probably too competitive. As this year moves past the trade deadline, expect George to be taking a lot of \"rest nights\" as Utah aims to hang onto its top-eight protected pick in this summer's draft. \nUntil then, however, Utah is giving a lot of teams fits, and George, like Murray, is fast becoming one of the most reliable clutch players. In fact, Inpredictable has him as the ninth most impactful player in the league in terms of clutch win probability added, and 10th in overall win probability, which also lends greater weight to box score stats in high-leverage situations. Meaning: A second-quarter shot isn't the same as knocking one down in the fourth quarter, or even more, the closing minute of a one-possession game, and George is doing a lot of the latter. \nNow, let's get back to Trae Young, who, unlike Murray and a little bit of C.J. McCollum, is not a good comp for George stylistically. Young dominates the ball. George moves away from it. But like George this season, Young has had some efficient shooting years sprinkled into a Basketball-Reference page that mostly shows an average, or especially from 3, a below-average shooter who kills a defense -- for which he is now being held accountable to a degree that his counting stats almost don't matter anymore. \nSo for George, is this efficiency just a one-year thing -- or even a couple-month thing -- for a guy who is ultimately going to revert back to volume-based, good-stats-bad-team scoring? There's a world in which Utah never gets good and George becomes something closer to the aforementioned Ellis, another electric but, ultimately, relatively inefficient scorer who cost you more defensively than his stats could make up for. Indeed, the defense has to be talked about. George is a more engaged defender than Young, for sure, and he's a little bit bigger. You can see effort, and his rotations have gotten more instinctual. Still, when he's on the court Utah is getting outscored by 6.7 points per 100 possessions, per CTG, with a defense that would rank as the worst in the league. A George supporter would say Utah's defense as a whole stinks without Walker Kessler, who's out for the season, and they wouldn't be wrong. Over 101 non-garbage possessions this season, the Jazz blitzed opponents by 34.5 points with a 105.0 defensive rating when George played alongside the super-sized foursome of Markannen, Kyle Filipowski, Svi Mykhailiuk and Kessler. There's some evidence, if someone were inclined to hunt for it, that George can be a functional part of an insulative defense. A George naysayer, however, could also point to the fact that the defense, as it stands, gets better by nine points per 100 possessions when George sits and make a pretty compelling case that he's a big part of the problem.Right now, nobody cares about that because nobody expects the Jazz to win. George is in the honeymoon period. But when the time comes that results start to matter, all this awesome stuff George is doing on the offensive end, particularly if it reverts back to some of the old percentages, will start to lose of its luster if his defense proves to be the liability that it looks like it might be right now. Monta Ellis was fun to watch. But you weren't going to win with him leading your team. \nSo is George more Murray or Ellis? That feels like a fair ceiling and floor based on what we've seen. Will he experience some of the Trae Young blowback when he's on a team expected to compete and his flaws go from overlooked to magnetized? Can the defense improve? Can the shooting sustain? Will the Jazz trade Markannen and throw a wrench in everything? These are all things to watch, and consider, as part of the bigger Keyonte George picture, which, for what it's worth at the moment, is starting to look like a work of art. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is over and the playoffs are here. When you think about it, it's actually been a unique yet incredible season. There will be no Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow in the Super Bowl this year, as 2025 was really defined by the number of turnarounds we witnessed. This year features the most playoff teams coming off of 11-loss seasons all-time with five. We have four different division winners that registered five or fewer wins the previous year, and we have the most worst-to-first division winners all-time with three: The New England Patriots, Chicago Bears and Carolina Panthers. Yes, the Carolina Panthers are in the playoffs this year! Who saw that coming?Now that the smoke has cleared, which teams are the favorites to win it all at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8? Here are the latest Super Bowl LX odds, courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Super Bowl LX oddsTeamOddsSeattle Seahawks+350Los Angeles Rams+425Denver Broncos+650Philadelphia Eagles+950New England Patriots+950Buffalo Bills+1000Jacksonville Jaguars+1300Houston Texans+1300Green Bay Packers+2200Chicago Bears+2200San Francisco 49ers+2800Los Angeles Chargers+2800Pittsburgh Steelers+4500Carolina Panthers+15000Seahawks are the favoritesThe Seahawks are the favorites to win the Super Bowl this year, and you can understand why after Saturday night. Not only has Seattle made the Super Bowl every time its earned the No. 1 seed, but this defense embarrassed Brock Purdy and the 49ers on their home field in Week 18. The three points San Francisco scored were the fewest in a game since 2017, and that was the first game of Kyle Shanahan's head coaching career! Christian McCaffrey was held to 23 rushing yards on eight carries, and Purdy threw for 127 yards and one interception as the 49ers went 2 of 9 on third downs and recorded just 173 yards of total offense. Those numbers are staggering. There's no doubt the Seahawks have one of the best defenses in the NFL, but we can't say the same about the offense. The Seahawks went 0-3 in the red zone on Saturday, but did win the turnover battle, 1-0. That's important, because the Seahawks are 8-0 this season when they commit one or zero turnovers. If Sam Darnold can rely on Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet and take care of the football while hitting those downfield shots to Jaxon Smith-Njigba, it's clear Seattle is going to be a problem. 50/50 in the AFC South?The Jaguars' win over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday means they clinched the division, while the Texans will be the top wild card at No. 5. Despite the home-field advantage, Vegas views these teams as having the same chance to win the Super Bowl (+1300).If you had to pick the Texans or Jaguars as your Super Bowl sleeper, which would you choose? On one hand, the Texans have boasted the No. 1 defense in the NFL all year. On the other, questions remain about the offense, while Houston is 0-5 all-time on the road in the playoffs. The Texans are the only team in NFL history to have never won a playoff game on the road. As for the Jaguars, they are on an eight-game win streak, but a first-year coach hasn't won a Super Bowl since 1989. That was George Seifert, who was a member of the 49ers coaching staff for nearly a decade before being promoted to lead man, and adopted a reigning Super Bowl champion.If I had to pick one, I do find myself leaning a bit towards the Jaguars. Trevor Lawrence is playing like one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL right now, having accounted for 19 total touchdowns compared to one turnover over the past six games, and the defense has recorded 31 takeaways, which ranks No. 2 in the NFL behind the Bears. That first matchup against the Bills is a tough one, though. Speaking of...Bills as a sleeper?It's curious, imagine going back in time four months ago and telling yourself that Josh Allen will be in the playoffs, while Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow will be at home on the couch. You would probably guess that the Bills are Super Bowl favorites, but that is not the case. In fact, there are five teams with better odds than Buffalo to win it all.The Bills have lost eight straight road playoff games despite having the unicorn that is Allen. He has the most playoff wins (7) without a Super Bowl appearance by a quarterback all-time. What I'm worried about with Buffalo this year is if this hodgepodge of weapons can support a Super Bowl run, and if the worst run defense in the playoffs will end up being the Bills' undoing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One day after firing head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot, the Atlanta Falcons are making even more moves as owner Arthur Blank reimagines the future of the franchise.The Falcons are creating a \"president of football\" position to which the new general manager and head coach will report. Longtime Falcons executive Rich McKay will remain with Blank's larger group of family business, but he will no longer be the CEO of the Falcons after more than two decades near the top of the food chain with the team.Lastly, Falcons president Greg Beadles will assume the role of team CEO. His focus has been and will remain on the business operations. The new president of football will, of course, oversee football.It is a seismic shift in the way the Falcons will do business. Atlanta has not been to the playoffs since the 2017 season, and since then Blank has fired three different head coaches and two general managers as he embarks on yet more searches for team leaders.\nAt present, it is unclear if the president of football position will be considered by the NFL league office to be the \"primary football executive\" role that generally goes to a general manager. Who has say over the 53-man roster and the draft is usually a team's primary football executive. Just last week, the Titans cleared up their organizational chart after confusion from the previous year with their own president of football operations and GM.Legendary Falcons quarterback and CBS Sports analyst Matt Ryan has been linked to a front office role in Atlanta, according to multiple reports and sources. Sources say Ryan is being considered by the team for the president role. Ryan and CBS Sports have not commented.The Falcons will want to move quickly with their searches, which is evidenced by the team hiring two separate sports consulting firms for the head coach and GM jobs. While plenty of franchises hire search firms, sources cannot recall a time a single franchise hired two firms in the same year. Those firms will not be involved in the decision-making process and will only help with background checks and logistics, according to a source.\nBlank and Beadles will clearly be part of the leadership group making decisions on these positions. So, too, will Josh Blank, the sone of the owner who, in his late 20s, has for years been preparing himself to have an increased role with the team -- and some day lead it.McKay ends his direct ties with the team after originally joining the club in 2003 as its general manager. He served in that role until 2008, when he moved to president/CEO of the team until 2023. McKay was in charge of football operations in that position while Beadles oversaw the business side. The new president of football will assume McKay's previous duties as he moves over to Blank's AMB Sports and Entertainment.On Sunday night, the Falcons fired head coach Morris after just two seasons, as well as Fontenot after five seasons. Sources said the Falcons believe a clean slate and reset at those positions will make both jobs more desirable to candidates.\nThe Falcons can begin virtual interviews as early as Wednesday. In-person interviews with candidates currently employed by other teams cannot begin until Jan. 19.The Falcons have to abide by league rules on high-level jobs, interviewing the appropriate number of external candidates from minority backgrounds before landing on their choice. If Atlanta wishes to move quickly on the GM and head coach interviews, it is logical to believe the Falcons will want to have the president of football installed with some haste.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After six seasons and two of the only three playoff appearances for this iteration of the franchise, the Cleveland Browns fired head coach Kevin Stefanski on Monday morning. Stefanski, 43, is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year and signed an extension with the team in 2024. But since then the Browns have won just eight of a possible 34 games, and the offensive-minded head coach has given up play-calling duties to two different offensive coordinators in that time.\"We appreciate all [Stefanski's hard work and dedication to our organization but our results over the last two seasons have not been satisfactory, and we believe a change at the head coaching position is necessary,\" managing and principal Partners Dee and Jimmy Haslam said in a statement. The Browns will retain general manager Andrew Berry, who will embark on a search for the next head coach that sources believe will likely yield another first-time head coach. And that man could very well have Shedeur Sanders as his Week 1 quarterback next season.\nLeague sources believe Stefanski could get another head-coaching job this cycle. The coaching pool is not teeming with the sort of perceived talent as last year's crop. Stefanski could be a candidate with both the Titans and Giants.The writing had been on the wall for Stefanski for months in Cleveland as it seemed like he and leadership got off the same page. He had to operate a clunky four-person quarterback competition in the summer with Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, Dillon Gabriel and Sanders. Flacco was the clear winner and gave the team the best chance to win, but second-team reps ultimately got wasted on Pickett when he was traded before the start of the season to the Raiders for a nice fifth-round return.Flacco started four games before Stefanski turned to Gabriel, and then the Browns made the surprising move to trade the veteran to the Bengals for a fifth-round pick. What did not help Stefanski was Flacco going from a 60.3 quarterback rating in Cleveland to 91.0 rating in Zac Taylor's offense.\nIn Week 10, Stefanski handed play-calling duties over to Tommy Rees, who is well liked by owner Jimmy Haslam. It was the second straight year of Stefanski making the move after doing so with Ken Dorsey in 2024 before firing him. By the end of this season, the Browns offense ranked in the bottom-three in the league in yards and points.And then there's Sanders, who was taken in the fifth round by the team and who garnered more attention than any fifth-round rookie in recent NFL memory. He played in eight games and started in seven of them. By most metrics Sanders was the worst regular starter in the league this season.In seven starts Sanders had 1,400 pass yards, seven touchdowns to 10 interceptions, took 23 sacks and had a quarterback rating of 68.1, the lowest among qualifying quarterbacks.\nThe Browns will select in the top 10 of April's draft but will likely be out of the range for a quarterback like Fernando Mendoza. Sources say the Browns are preparing for Sanders to be their starter next season, hoping to build around the quarterback and get better results in Year 2.What coaching candidate the Browns will be able to attract is a big question hovering over the organization. The coach will need to believe in Sanders, as well as in the front office to deliver on offensive line and receiver acquisitions. Sources have said that a coach with options may not have the Browns high on his list.Since the Browns returned to Cleveland in 1999, the Browns will be looking for their 11th different head coach.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the Cleveland Browns have fired coach Kevin Stefanski following a 5-12 finish this season, the next step on the agenda is figuring out the long-term plan for rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who went 3-4 as a starter.Sanders expressed respect for Stefanski after Sunday's 20-18 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, saying the pair \"grew to understand each other\" this season.\"We would share different things that we would both go through,\" Sanders said. \"I know he wanted this win, and I know he wants every win, but I know that this one means a lot. I wish we all played as a team, and I wish we could have done more personally within this last year.\"Stefanski did not address his future after the finale, but his job status had been reportedly up in the air for weeks given the Browns' slide.\nSanders went 11-of-22 for 111 yards with a lost fumble in his final start. Over eight games, Sanders finished 120-of-212 for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions with a passer rating of 68.1. His best outing came in a Dec. 7 loss to the Tennessee Titans after he threw for 364 yards and three touchdowns.After Sanders became the Browns' first quarterback to win his first career start since 1995 in November, Stefanski gave the fifth-round pick an extended look. If retained, Sanders will have to make a similar, positive impression on Cleveland's new hire.\"I can't think about other people opinion or what they view me as,\" Sanders said when asked about his future. \"I know the teams, the teams that we go against. I know they definitively respect me and the passing game, for sure. But I can't be accountable for somebody else's decision.\"\nBrowns quarterback options for 2026Whatever ownership decides with Cleveland's pending coaching hire, the next move is determining the quarterback room. Sanders is on an extremely team-friendly four-year, $4.6 million deal and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel returns, too, along with high-priced Deshaun Watson.The Browns signed Watson to a five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract in March 2022 and he has only made 19 starts since, a result of NFL suspension and several injuries. Given his contract, Watson is not a tradable asset in Cleveland and won't be off the books until 2030.Cleveland holds two first-round picks in the 2026 NFL Draft, including the No. 6 overall. It's possible the Browns go with a quarterback, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones, making an expected competition that much more complicated.\n\"Watson will be unmovable while Gabriel and Sanders will be entering their second seasons,\" Jones wrote. \"Some league sources have wondered if Cleveland would look to deal one of them come next season. And then there's the unknown quarterback for Cleveland, someone who is currently playing in college who the Browns can draft using the capital gained from the Travis Hunter trade.\"The evaluation process at quarterback begins for Cleveland as soon as the franchise decides on its new regime. The Browns didn't get a full-season look at Sanders and the incoming staff and offensive coordinator has limited film to form the basis of an opinion on whether he's the scheme-fit option moving forward.Sanders' opportunity to leave a lasting, positive imprint in the season finale didn't go as planned until the final possession of Sunday's game. It marked only the second time in seven starts he didn't throw a touchdown pass, but Sanders was precise on Cleveland's game-winning drive to set up Andre Szmyt's 49-yard kick as time expired.\n\"I learned what I like, I learned what I don't like and I know what I'm seeing and what I don't see well,\" Sanders said about his rookie season. \"I learned a lot mentally, physically, emotionally and everything. I think mentally, it was how to deal with feelings when things weren't going your way.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ruben Amorim has been sacked by Manchester United. The 40-year-old left his position just 14 months into a contract that had been due to keep him at the club until the summer of 2027.However, an extraordinary press conference after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Leeds brought bubbling discontent behind the scenes into the open, followed by the swift departure of a coach who had led Manchester United to sixth in the Premier League.\"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United,\" said a club statement. \"Ruben was appointed in November, 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"\nUnited will not rush the appointment of a successor to Amorim, according to CBS Sports sources, with U18 head coach Fletcher set to step up for the visit to Turf Moor, which is followed by an FA Cup third round tie against Brighton. After that comes a run of games against the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham that could be pivotal in the Red Devils' pursuit of European football.\nAmorim leaves with United positioned to return to continental competitions after a disastrous 2024-25 season ended with them in 15th place with their fewest points in a top-flight season for over half a century. The Portuguese had been appointed in November with the club hierarchy intent on showing patience with a coach known for great success at Sporting but also for a particular tactical style. As recently as October, minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who effectively leads the football side of the club, even if this sacking will have been taken in conjunction with the Glazer family, had spoken of giving Amorim three years to prove himself.That changed in the immediate aftermath of incendiary comments on Sunday in which Amorim insisted he had arrived in Manchester to be the \"manager\" of the club, not the \"head coach.\" United's statement announcing his appointment in November 2024 would suggest otherwise but this was not the first sign of tension behind the scenes. Amorim had previously spoken about the need to \"spend a lot of money\" to allow him to play the idealized version of the 3-4-3 system he favored for most of his tenure, only to move away from it in a 1-0 win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day.\nThat was the 15th and final win of 47 Premier League matches in charge and United are understood to view this sacking as reflective of poor performances on the pitch rather than any internal power struggles. Amorim's record of 1.23 points per game in the division is hardly that of a coach who can complain about getting the sack. Manchester United's expected goal difference in the Premier League on a rolling 10 game average since the start of the 2022-23 season \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            And yet there were signs in recent months of a team that was slowly but steadily improving, the graph above showing their expected goal difference on a 10-game rolling average and pointing to a side inching back towards the levels of 2022-23. In that season, they finished third under Erik ten Hag. Amorim departs with United three points off champions Liverpool in fourth, though a particularly condensed middle of the table means they are only four points ahead of 14th-placed Crystal Palace.Such fine margins speak to the gamble United might be taking in handing the reins to Fletcher, who has coached 15 matches with the U18s and none at senior level. The club have framed their decision as an attempt to push towards the upper echelons of the table that they were chasing long before Amorim's appointment. Only time will tell if this sacking is vindicated in the short term.\n            ",

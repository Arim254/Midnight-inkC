    "body": "\n        LEIPZIG, Germany – Jurgen Klopp has once again rejected the notion that he is in the running to become the next coach of Real Madrid, admitting he is \"at peace\" since leaving the touchline in 2024 and assuming a role as Red Bull's head of global soccer.Xabi Alonso's time at Real Madrid came to a close after just seven months following a 3-2 defeat to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final last week and Klopp's name has been linked to the vacancy. He quickly rejected the notion in an interview the day after Alonso's ouster and did so again on Saturday ahead of RB Leipzig's 5-1 defeat to Bayern Munich.\"I'm in a place as a person, I'm at peace,\" Klopp said in a media roundtable over the weekend. \"I don't want to be somewhere else. I don't get up and excited if, whatever, Real Madrid is showing interest – if they would, but it's the media.\"Since departing Liverpool in May 2024 and assuming his new job at Red Bull a year ago, Klopp has insisted that his days on the touchline might be over, previously telling CBS Sports that he misses \"nothing\" about his previous role. He reiterated that stance yet again, almost closing the chapter on that period of his career entirely.\n\"We [are] build[ing] a house right now and my missus wanted to have a trophy room that was really big and there was another small room and I said, 'This is enough,' because we know exactly how many trophies we had and we will not add any,\" Klopp said. \"Again, I don't know what I'll think in five years when I'm 63. That's not too old for the job or in two, three years, I don't know. I don't expect me to change my mind but I don't know how we all don't know exactly, so that's why. Do I want to coach again? In the moment, I would say no but we cannot say never, never, never, never but I'm completely happy with what I'm doing. It's a little bit like all the things I did in the past [led] me to be really suited for this moment.\"Klopp said he has had his fix of being a singular person of focus at a given team, instead using his new job at Red Bull to focus on the journey of building teams from a zoomed out perspective.\"I don't need to be in the center of this kind of thing,\" he said. \"I don't need to be on the pitch if we win something, be the one in the middle and these kidneys of things. It's nice but I've had enough of it and I'm not there to go again, go again, go again. If I feel that, I go again.\"\nEven though he left the door open for a potential return to the touchline one day, the decision to come back is unlikely to be made hastily.\"I always was happy where I am,\" he said. \"That's how it is, until I was not but it took time. I could say I was always happy but then after four days, I said, it's not great anymore. I know myself. I'm consistent. I don't change my mind overnight with these kinds of things.\"Klopp may be uninterested in taking the Real Madrid job but he did have a word of advice for Alonso's former employers as they search for a new coach.\n\"I heard the news, Xabi Alonso, and now it's a bit of a mixed [feeling],\" he said. \"Yes, I was surprised and no, I wasn't surprised. 'What! Of course,' a little bit like that so you could read it. I don't Google Real Madrid news but it was everywhere … I don't know what it says about Madrid or not, stuff like this, but I have no clue why it happened but it's always a specific case and not a general [one] because what they see now, bringing just the next one in is not that easy so I would recommend, if you sack a manager, better have an idea who you want to succeed and it should be realistic.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The divisional round is in the books, and the NFL's final four is set. It'll be the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks duking it out in the NFC Championship, while the New England Patriots will visit the Denver Broncos next Sunday for the AFC Championship. These matchups crystallized after another bonkers weekend of NFL playoff action that saw multiple overtime games and high drama throughout. Naturally, when the games are of this magnitude, they leave a pretty big impression. For instance, C.J. Stroud throwing four interceptions in a playoff loss to the New England Patriots is going to be branded on his résumé more than had that happened in some random game over the regular season. The same can be said for Josh Allen, who has his reputation dinged after missing a golden opportunity for his first trip to the Super Bowl with Buffalo this postseason after falling to Denver.  Those are some storylines that are legitimate narratives now out in the ether.  Then, there are some storylines that don't really carry much weight and are overblown. Just as we did for Day 1 of the divisional round, we're going to dive into some of the big-picture talking points that are coming out of the final day of this round below. To read the overreactions from Day 1, you can check them out here. C.J. Stroud cost himself millionsOverreaction or reality: OverreactionIt was a downright terrible day for C.J. Stroud. The Houston Texans quarterback looked lost throughout his team's 28-16 loss to the New England Patriots, and tossed four interceptions in the losing effort. Stroud was erratic with the ball for the bulk of the game and completed just 45.4% of his passes and finished with a 28.0 passer rating. \nWhen you factor in his poor showing over Wild Card Weekend against Pittsburgh, Stroud became the first player in NFL playoff history with five-plus interceptions and five-plus fumbles in a postseason. Not great. This disastrous postseason comes at a bad time for Stroud, who is extension-eligible this offseason. The knee-jerk reaction to this performance would be that the Texans should not sign Stroud to an extension and/or not ink him to a deal that pays him around $55 million annually with the upper-echelon quarterbacks. That won't happen, however. In all likelihood, the Texans are going to sign Stroud to a lucrative extension this offseason that makes him one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Why? Because they have no other choice. It's either pay Stroud or reset at the position entirely. While he hasn't given them a ton of confidence that he'll live up to his eventual monster extension, they'll inevitably slide it across the table for him to sign. \nBears comeback magic won't carry over into 2026Overreaction or reality: RealityThe Chicago Bears had one last rabbit to pull out of their hat, with Caleb Williams throwing a jaw-dropping 14-yard touchdown to Cole Kmet on a fourth-and-4 attempt to help send their divisional round matchup with the Rams to overtime. While L.A. was able to edge out the win in overtime, it was a herculean effort from Williams to force the extra period. \nAs ridiculous as that throw was, it was something we've come to expect from Williams and the Bears this season. In all, the franchise had seven wins this season when down in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter, which is an NFL record (including playoffs). They also had an NFL-high eight wins by fewer than seven points this season (including playoffs). You can call it a clutch gene, or you can call it luck that the ball bounced their way that many times. The one thing that you can definitely call it, however, is unsustainable. Chicago can't expect this late-game magic to carry over into 2026 and will need to revamp the roster this offseason in order to pull out a win without needing to pull off miracles. \nUse the Kansas City Chiefs as a cautionary tale. They were 11-0 in one-score games during the 2024 regular season. The following year, in 2025, they were 1-9 in one-score games. Patriots can overcome Drake Maye's turnoversOverreaction or reality: Overreaction\nLost in C.J. Stroud's four-interception day was that Drake Maye was also a little too loose with the football, albeit in the winning effort.In the win over Houston, Maye had four fumbles (two lost) and an interception. In the prior round against the Chargers, Maye also had protection issues, fumbling twice (one lost) and another pick. So, over the course of two playoff games this postseason, Maye has six fumbles (three lost) and two interceptions. Part of those turnovers is due to some protection issues along the left side of the offensive line, and facing some top-tier pass rushers, but Maye's awareness in the pocket has been lacking as well. \nJust because the Patriots have overcome them to this point doesn't mean that'll continue as they push deeper into the playoffs. Most view New England as a heavy favorite over the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship, particularly after Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury, and backup Jarrett Stidham is now slated to start. One way to give Stidham and the Broncos life, however, is handing the ball over, so Maye will need to tighten it up if he wants to advance to and win the Super Bowl. Sean McVay coached poorly despite Rams winOverreaction or reality: RealityWhen we talk about the best coaches in the NFL, it doesn't take long before Sean McVay comes up in the conversation, and for good reason. The Rams coach has routinely kept his team competitive and just earned his 10th career playoff win. That said, this latest showing from McVay will not go on the highlight reel. Despite coming out with the win, McVay had a poor coaching effort on Sunday night, making several head-scratching decisions.In the first half, he failed to properly attack a Bears run defense that allowed 134.5 yards per game during the regular season (sixth-most in the league). In all, L.A. ran the football just seven times over the first two quarters. McVay changed his tune over the second half and overtime (24 rushing attempts), but then leaned a little too heavily on the ground attack. \nSpecifically, he elected to run just before the two-minute warning with his team up 17-10. There was 2:07 on the game clock, and the Rams were looking at a third-and-10 situation. Because the cock was going to stop anyway, McVay should've put the ball in the air to try and convert and win the game in regulation. Then, McVay ran it three-straight times on the opening possession of overtime, which led to a three-and-out. Had Los Angeles' defense not picked off Caleb Williams to help set up the game-winning field goal, Chicago could've won the game with Matthew Stafford, the MVP favorite, not attempting a pass in overtime. \"Offensively, man, I did not do a very good job for our group tonight, but I thought our guys were able to overcome it,\" McVay told reporters postgame.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nMonday night's College Football Playoff National Championship Game between No. 1 Indiana and No. 10 Miami shapes up as a grueling, physical battle between two teams that have embraced that identity all season. The unbeaten Hoosiers are trying to become college football's first 16-0 national champion, but they must get past a resurgent Hurricanes team playing on its home field.Miami's path has been anything but easy. The Hurricanes knocked off No. 7 Texas A&M on the road, eliminated No. 2 Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl and outlasted No. 6 Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl to reach the title game. Powered by a massive offensive line, Miami has created running lanes for Mark Fletcher Jr. while quarterback Carson Beck distributes the ball to elite playmakers such as Malachi Toney, giving the Hurricanes a balanced, efficient attack.First-year defensive coordinator Corey Heatherman has elevated Miami's defense into one of the nation's best, bringing to life fourth-year coach Mario Cristobal's vision of a big, punishing roster. Still, the question remains whether that physicality is enough to test Indiana.The Hoosiers have overwhelmed everyone in their path, blasting No. 9 Alabama 38-3 in the Rose Bowl and dismantling No. 5 Oregon 56-22 in the Peach Bowl. With Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza at the controls and no obvious weaknesses on the roster, Indiana enters as a more-than-touchdown favorite.Second-year coach Curt Cignetti has orchestrated one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football history, putting Indiana on the brink of its first national championship.Keys to victory in CFP National Championship: How

been telling them all season? It has blown out Alabama and Oregon in consecutive playoff games and comes into the championship in much better shape than the Miami Hurricanes do health-wise. I don't expect we see a blowout along the lines of what the Rose and Peach Bowls provided, but I do expect the outcome will be clear before the fourth quarter starts. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 31, Miami 13Chip Patterson: I do think that Miami has the defense to be able to limit what Fernando Mendoza can do pushing the ball deep down the field and also a better rushing attack than Ohio State, which should help no bungling red zone opportunities like the Buckeyes did in the Big Ten title game. The Hoosiers' efficiency and effectiveness should keep them in control most of the game, but the playmaking potential should give Miami enough splash plays to keep it interesting. As long as Miami executes on its scoring chances, it will have a chance to win, but I've got Indiana (best TD% red zone defense in the country) winning those key plays to emerge as 16-0 national champions. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 30, Miami 20Brandon Marcello: Miami is still the most physical, violent team remaining in the playoff. Indiana has been unbreakable all season, even in a pair of close calls against Penn State and Iowa, but this Hurricanes team is relentless along the offensive and defensive lines. The problem for Miami is that it still doesn't quite trust quarterback Carson Beck to throw deep, leading to more underneath throws. Even against Ole Miss, drives stalled in the second half when the Hurricanes pulled away from running the ball with Mark Fletcher Jr. Indiana's offense gets a lot of attention with Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza, but it's the defense that has won games. I trust both quarterbacks in 2-minute situations, but Mendoza protects the ball and Beck is a bit more unpredictable. This will be a slugfest at times, but Indiana will pull away to make this the eighth straight title game with the champion winning by double digits. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 31, Miami 21John Talty: Indiana has been the best team all season long. They are elite offensively and defensively. They have America's best coaching staff. They have my favorite curmudgeon in the sport. I've been riding with the Hoosiers since the spring, and I'm not stopping now. What once felt unbelievable will become reality: Indiana as national champions. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 34, Miami 20Shehan Jeyarajah: Indiana has been a perfect football team in 2025, and it will ultimately end with an elusive first national championship. It won't come easy. Miami's top-rated defensive line will force mistakes, including at least one turnover from Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza. However, Mendoza's legend will be cemented with a fourth-quarter touchdown to ice the game and deliver the Hoosiers an unlikely title. Pick: Indiana - 8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 17David Cobb: Miami's offensive line is sturdy enough to prevent Indiana's defensive front from completely taking over, a necessity if the Hurricanes hope to stay within striking distance. On the other side, Miami has enough punch up front -- led by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akeem Mesidor -- to make the Hoosiers uncomfortable at times. Ultimately, Indiana looks like a team of destiny and should win outright. But Miami is capable of turning this into a fight. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 27, Miami 20Richard Johnson: Indiana will get the job done largely on the strength of their defense. With all the post-snap movement and zone drops that Indiana incorporates to their defense, my expectation is that eventually Carson Beck will get fooled and give the Hoosiers a couple interceptions. It's all they'll need to outlast Miami and tip the scales in their favor with the extra possessions. It's also the path that could see the game get truly out of hand. Pick: Indiana -8.5 | Indiana 34, Miami 17Chris Hummer: Miami is playing a national championship game at home. What a story. What an opportunity. What a moment. The Hurricanes can't lose it, right? Well ... here comes Indiana. It feels ridiculous to type that with a 15-0 Indiana. It's Indiana! History tells us this isn't possible, but Curt Cignetti has created a monster in Bloomington. They're the most well-coached, most disciplined and best team in the country. Plus, they have a Heisman Trophy-winning QB and, if you talk to coaches around the sport, have a roster that athletically matches up with anyone. As crazy as it feels to write, I'm picking Indiana to win a national championship. How could I not? Maybe Miami finds a bit more magic at home. But this has been the season of Indiana. As long as Indiana's o-line can hold up on the edges, it wins this game. Pick: Miami +8.5 | Indiana 24, Miami 21Who will win and cover in Indiana vs. Miami?

    "body": "\n        No postseason has had more chaotic finishes than the 2025 playoffs going on right now. There have been 15 fourth-quarter lead changes and five comeback wins in the final three minutes this postseason, the most in a single playoffs all-time, according to CBS Sports Research.Despite all the chaos, the conference championship games for both the AFC and the NFC are somewhat chalky. The AFC features a matchup between the conference's two top seed's, the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos, while the NFC showcases its top seed, the Seattle Seahawks, against the team with the second-best record in the conference, the Los Angeles Rams. Even though the heavyweights reached the NFL's final four, the 2025 slate features the second-widest experience gap between the remaining teams' starting quarterbacks in the league's postseason history. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford (251 career starts) has started 124 more games than Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye and Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham combined (127 combined starts). Only Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (286 career starts) had a larger gap over his three remaining conference championship quarterback peers in the 2017 season when he had 143 more starts than Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles, Minnesota Vikings quarterback Case Keenum and Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles (143 combined starts). So what will happen in the 2025 conference championship games? Enjoy a couple early breakdowns and predictions to kick off your week. \nAFC: New England Patriots (2) at Denver Broncos (1)The quarterback matchup for this game went from a bragging rights battle for the 2024 NFL Draft's third overall pick, New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, and the 2024 NFL Draft's 12th overall pick, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, to bragging rights between two quarterbacks drafted by the Patriots. Broncos backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will be filling in as Denver's starter with Nix now out for the season after fracturing a bone in his ankle on the second to last play of the Broncos' 33-30 overtime win in the divisional round over the Buffalo Bills. Stidham, a 2019 fourth-round pick by New England, was actually set to enter training camp as the Patriots' starting quarterback after Tom Brady's free agency departure to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Then, New England signed Cam Newton just before training camp began. He'll now be the first quarterback ever to start a conference championship game against the team that drafted him. He'll have his work cut for him with the way the Patriots defense is playing at the moment. New England possesses more playoff wins (two) than touchdowns allowed (one) this postseason. Their one touchdown allowed is tied for the fewest touchdowns allowed across the wild card and divisional rounds in the 21st century. The other two teams who have also done the same, the 2000 Baltimore Ravens and the 2006 Indianapolis Colts, both went on to win the Super Bowl. The Patriots turned the Texans over a whopping five times on Sunday afternoon, and they continuously got their hands on the football. New England's 14 passes defended stands as the most by any team in a postseason game since the 2004 Philadelphia Eagles' 17 in the divisional round against the Minnesota Vikings. \nHowever, the Broncos are the NFL's best pass rush, finishing the regular season with an NFL-most 68 sacks, 11 more than the second-place Atlanta Falcons' 57. Denver defensive coordinator Vance Joseph isn't afraid to bring the heat, blitzing at the fifth-highest rate (33.9%) in the regular season. The Broncos' pass rush could put Maye in the danger zone after he's absorbed five sacks in both the wild card and divisional rounds. Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, the 2025 NFL Draft fourth overall pick, is struggling this postseason with nine sacks and 30 quarterback pressures allowed in two games. Where to watch Patriots vs. Broncos liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High (Denver)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -5.5, O/U 40.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nEarly Patriots vs. Broncos prediction, pickMaye, the 2025 second-team All-Pro quarterback, makes many more big time throws than Stidham despite both facing top tier defenses. Of the previous six quarterbacks to make their first start of a season in the playoffs, only one (Buffalo Bills backup Frank Reich) won a game. Reich famously led the Bills to the largest comeback in NFL postseason history, 32 points, in the 1992 wild card round against the Houston Oilers. The odds are New England escapes Mile High with a multi-score victory given the vast disparity in what each team's quarterback has accomplished this season. Early pick: Patriots 27, Broncos 13 | Patriots -5.5, Under 40.5  \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff winners and losers for divisional round: Josh Allen's, Bo Nix's years over; C.J.

The home team has won both matchups thus far this season. Los Angeles triumphed 21-19 in Week 11 at SoFi Stadium after Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold tossed a career-high four interceptions. In Week 16 at Lumen Field, the Seahawks erased a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit (30-14) to roar all the way back for a 38-37 overtime victory. Los Angeles fired special teams coordinator Chris Blackburn two days after that defeat in which Rashid Shaheed's 58-yard punt return touchdown sparked Seattle's comeback. \nThe Sunday showdown in the NFC Championship marks the ninth playoff game in the conference championship round or Super Bowl since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger between the No. 1 scoring offense -- the Rams led the NFL with 30.5 points per game in 2025 and the No. 1 scoring defense -- the Seahawks led the NFL with 17.2 points per game allowed in 2025. It's worth noting the No. 1 defense has triumphed over the No. 1 offense in seven of the prior eight such matchups. No. 1 scoring offense vs. No. 1 scoring defense, conference championship game or later, Since 1970 OffenseDefense2025 NFC ChampionshipRamsSeahawks2016 Super Bowl FalconsPatriots*2014 NFC ChampionshipPackersSeahawks*2013 Super BowlBroncosSeahawks*1990 Super BowlBillsGiants*1989 Super Bowl49ers*Broncos1984 Super BowlDolphins49ers*1980 NFC ChampionshipCowboysEagles*1978 Super Bowl CowboysSteelers** Won gameWhere to watch Rams vs. Seahawks liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field (Seattle)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)\nEarly Rams vs. Seahawks prediction, pickBoth of the 2025 matchups between these teams have been so close. The Rams won by two points in Week 11, and the Seahawks won by a single point in overtime in Week 16. Both Rams head coach Sean McVay's offense and Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald's defenses have been incredible this season. However, if there's one quarterback who could make a big mistake in this game, it's Darnold. He led the league with 20 turnovers in the regular season, and he's struggled with Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula's defense across his last three games against Los Angeles dating to the 2024 NFC wild card round with the Minnesota Vikings. That night, Darnold absorbed an NFL playoff record nine sacks in a 27-9 defeat. Fast forward to today, and Darnold has an oblique injury. He wasn't nearly as mobile in the pocket in Seattle's 41-6 divisional round win against the San Francisco 49ers because of the ailment. Given his history against the Rams and his current health situation, Los Angeles wins the NFC Championship by a field goal. Sam Darnold's last three games vs. Rams, span begins in 2024 wild card round with VikingsStatsCompletion pct64.4%Pass TD-Turnovers3-8Passer rating67.5Times sacked13** Includes nine sacks in 2024 wild card round loss with Vikings, tied for the most in a playoff game in NFL historyEarly pick: Rams 24, Seahawks 21 | Rams +2.5, Under 47.5  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        And then there were four. The NFC and AFC Championship representatives have been determined, and the winners of those two games will square off in Super Bowl LX.Just three games remain that will impact where each team picks in the 2026 NFL Draft. The final missing piece in determining the complete order for all seven rounds will be the announcement of compensatory selections, which came on the second Tuesday in March last year.As a reminder, four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- do not own a first-round pick in 2026 due to draft-day trades, including the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals.Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order:1. Las Vegas Raiders (3-14)Las Vegas over-extended last offseason by drafting a running back in the top-10 and trading for a 35-year-old quarterback despite having one of the league's worst rosters. As a result, they fired head coach Pete Carroll after one season and are now picking even earlier in the draft. \n2. New York Jets (3-14)The Jets finished with one of the worst records in the league, but at least they have a plan and put themselves in a position to change the course of their franchise. Over the next two years, New York has five first-round picks. 3. Arizona Cardinals (3-14)Arizona made the decision to part with head coach Jonathan Gannon. It would not be a surprise if they moved on from Kyler Murray as well. The problem is that there are not a wealth of options to replace Murray.4. Tennessee Titans (3-14)The positive momentum Tennessee had built over the past month came to a frustrating end in the season finale. Still, Cam Ward's strong finish to the 2025 campaign should give Titans fans hope.\n5. New York Giants (4-13)There are reasons to be optimistic about Jaxson Dart's future with the franchise. He brought life to an offense that could have easily wallowed in self-pity following the Malik Nabers and Andrew Thomas injuries. If they get the head coach hire right, then maybe the a bounce back will happen sooner than most would expect.   6. Cleveland Browns (5-12)The Browns made the decision to part with head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons. He did lead the franchise to its first playoff win post-expansion, but may not be any closer to identifying the quarterback of the future. 7. Washington Commanders (5-12)Next season is an easy sell for Washington. If Jayden Daniels returns healthy, then they will be competitive once again, but there are a lot of needs on that roster. An attempt to microwave those weaknesses last offseason did not work out. \n8. New Orleans Saints (6-11)The Saints' season ended just as fans were clamoring for more of Tyler Shough. He looks like the clear favorite to open next season as the starting quarterback, bringing a level of optimism that simply didn't exist earlier in the year.9. Kansas City Chiefs (6-11)Kansas City will enter next season in unfamiliar territory: the hungry underdog. Assuming Patrick Mahomes' full health, there is no reason to believe the Chiefs will not be in the mix again next season. They do have a deteriorating roster that desperately needs a youthful infusion. 10. Cincinnati Bengals (6-11)Joe Burrow made a notable attempt to get the Bengals into the playoffs after succumbing to an injury early in the season, but ultimately fell short. The offense will be in a spot to compete next season, but can the defense improve enough this offseason to get them enough stops?\n\n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 5.0: Dante Moore's decision shakes up Round 1, forcing Jets to pivot at No. 2\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n11. Miami Dolphins (7-10)Fans can say what they want about the Mike McDaniel era in Miami, but few had such a recognizable aesthetic as the Dolphins' former coach. It is a fresh start for the organization with a new general manager, new head coach and presumably a new quarterback.12. Dallas Cowboys (7-9-1)Dallas is once again searching for answers this offseason. Dak Prescott was healthy and the team still failed to reach the playoffs with a new head coach. 13. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (8-9)Atlanta fired Raheem Morris as head coach for a second time. They sent their first round pick to Los Angeles as part of the trade up for James Pearce Jr. \n14. Baltimore Ravens (8-9)For the first time since 2007, the Ravens will have a new head coach after firing John Harbaugh. It sounds as though the franchise chose Lamar Jackson -- who turned 29-years-old one day after Harbaugh's firing -- over the veteran coach. 15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9)Other organizations have been quick to make a head coaching change, but the Buccaneers are going down the path of firing coordinators rather than a change at the top. 16. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-9)Cornerback Sauce Gardner struggled to stay healthy and the Colts' pick being sent to New York rose precipitously by the week. \n17. Detroit Lions (9-8)The coaching drain that took place after last season's run was likely understated in the moment given the presence Dan Campbell has over that organization, but that, along with a few veteran offensive line departures, led to a much more tumultuous season.18. Minnesota Vikings (9-8)J.J. McCarthy's season was volatile, which was once the expectation for a young quarterback. Recent rookie performances from Jayden Daniels and C.J. Stroud set unrealistic expectations for the majority. Caleb Williams is proof that situation matters. 19. Carolina Panthers (8-9)The team with the worst record in the NFL Playoffs, but also a home game, was the first punted from the postseason. Although not a desirable conclusion, the Panthers have to be pleased with how the season played out. \n20. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-7-1)The team with the second worst record in the NFL Playoffs was also dispatched after building a 21-3 lead over the division rival Bears. It is going to be an interesting offseason for the Packers. 21. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7)The Steelers couldn't do anything against an elite Texans defense as the team suffered its seventh straight playoff loss.22. Los Angeles Chargers (11-6)The Chargers are headed home for the season after falling to the Patriots in the wild card round.\n23. Philadelphia Eagles (11-6)A frustrating season, for fans and receivers alike, came to an end Sunday against the 49ers. The Eagles will be doing some soul searching this offseason. 24. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4)The Jaguars have every reason to celebrate their accomplishments this season. Yes, they lost in the wild card round as the home team, but a year ago, they were making preparations for the No. 5 overall pick. The future is bright for a team who played most of this season without No. 2 overall selection Travis Hunter.25. Chicago Bears (11-6)The Bears forced overtime on yet another miraculous, game-tying throw by Caleb Williams, but the last of his three interceptions proved costly, setting up the Rams' game-winning field goal in the divisional round.\n26. Buffalo Bills (12-5)The stage was set for Josh Allen to excel in a playoff setting that excluded the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson, but it ended the same as every other year -- in heartbreak.27. San Francisco 49ers (12-5)San Francisco's divisional round game against the Seahawks was never in question. The Seahawks scored the game's first 17 points, and the 49ers were outscored 17-0 in the second half as well. The franchise has big questions to answer this offseason.28. Houston Texans (12-5)C.J. Stroud completed four passes to the opposition Sunday afternoon, which left the margins for victory very slim. Despite those issues, Houston maintained striking distance for most of the game, but the Patriots pulled away late. 29. Los Angeles Rams (12-5)Chicago's snow slowed Matthew Stafford and the high-flying Rams offense, but they did enough in overtime to survive the Bears and advance to the NFC Championship Game.30. New England Patriots (14-3)Drake Maye was not immune to his own turnover tendencies. He threw an interception and lost two of his four fumbles. However, the stage is set for them to advance to the Super Bowl given Denver will be playing a backup at quarterback next week. 31. Denver Broncos (14-3)Denver suffered the rare win that feels like a loss. It was learned after the game that Bo Nix had broken his ankle and would miss the AFC Championship. 32. Seattle Seahawks (14-3)Seattle returns to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2014 after drubbing the 49ers on Saturday night.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23–25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 playoffs have been surreal. Following the conclusion of the divisional round, none of the NFL's top seven teams in preseason Super Bowl odds are left in the playoff field, according to Sports Odds History via BetMGM betting data.The Buffalo Bills were the last such team, and they're now going home after their third consecutive playoff loss by three or fewer points, following Saturday's 33-30 overtime defeat at the Denver Broncos. They're now the only NFL team to ever do that, per CBS Sports Research. Buffalo's 73 regular-season wins since 2020 are the most in the league this decade, but they are now the most ever in a six-season span without a Super Bowl appearance. The Seattle Seahawks' 41-6 steamrolling of the San Francisco 49ers tied their most lopsided playoff win in team history. Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud made the wrong kind of NFL history on Sunday in a 28-16 defeat at the New England Patriots, and Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams produced the full Williams rollercoaster experience in the Los Angeles Rams' 20-17 overtime victory. With all that and more going down in the NFL across the last two days, it's time to dig into the divisional round's biggest winners and losers. \nBroncos triumph over Bills 33-30 in overtime\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winner & loser: Bo NixBo Nix ended up as both a winner and a loser, following Denver's thrilling 33-30 overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills. He's a winner for tying the Broncos' single-game playoff passing touchdowns record with three, the last of which came on a dime to wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. to put the Broncos up 30-27 with 55 seconds left in regulation. Nix quieted his doubters by following up that throw by leading Denver on his eighth game-winning drive of the season, which tied an NFL single-season record including the playoffs.He is a loser because even though his team won, his 2025 NFL season is finished. Head coach Sean Payton announced postgame that Nix fractured a bone in his ankle on the penultimate play of the game and will have surgery on Tuesday. Brutal blow for Nix to lose the chance to start an AFC Championship on his home field.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Loser: Josh Allen There is no bigger loser in the entire divisional round of the 2025 postseason than Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. Allen's Bills' prior five playoff losses were against Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs and Joe Burrow's Cincinnati Bengals. All of the teams he lost to went to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl with some of the best quarterback talents in the league today.\nMahomes, Burrow and two-time NFL MVP Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson all weren't present in the AFC's 2025 season playoff bracket. Not only did Allen fall short despite his Bills being favored on Saturday, but he literally helped give the game away. After not turning the ball over in his previous six playoff games, Allen turned the ball over four times -- twice via interceptions and twice via lost fumbles. The Broncos scored nine points off of Allen's giveaways, including a 50-yard field goal at the halftime buzzer and the game-winning, 23-yard field goal in overtime. He became just the fourth quarterback in the 21st century to throw multiple interceptions and lose multiple fumbles in a single playoff game. He also airmailed a pass to a wide-open Dawson Knox with 16 seconds left in regulation that could have easily been the game-winning touchdown pass with nearly no time remaining. Allen could have had a signature playoff moment, but he just couldn't connect in the clutch. Instead, his Bills are now the first team ever to lose a playoff game in three consecutive seasons by three or fewer points, according to CBS Sports Research. Multiple interceptions and multiple fumbles lost in a playoff game, Since 2000SeasonBUF Josh Allen2025ARI Carson Palmer2015DEN Jake Plummer2005NYJ Chad Pennington2002Allen may never have a postseason path appear to be as easy as the one that was presented to him in 2025, which is why he fought through tears and said, \"I feel like I let my teammates down,\" at the postgame podium.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winners: Sean Payton and Wil LutzBoth Sean Payton and Broncos kicker Wil Lutz were together on the 2018 New Orleans Saints where they were on the wrong side of a pass interference call in an eventual 26-23 overtime NFC Championship game defeat against the Los Angeles Rams.\nAgainst the Bills, the Broncos netted 47 yards combined on two pass interference penalties in overtime that helped set up Lutz's game-winning, 23-yard field goal. That's a win for those two. \nSeahawks pummel 49ers 41-6\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winner: Kenneth Walker IIIKenneth Walker is set to become a free agent this offseason, and his stock couldn't be any higher after his performance in the divisional round. He amassed 145 yards from scrimmage (119 rushing and 29 receiving) and three rushing touchdowns in a winning effort. He joined 2005 NFL MVP running back Shaun Alexander as the only players in Seahawks history with at least three rushing touchdowns in a playoff game. Walker is primed to cash in come March. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winner: Sam Darnold's obliqueSam Darnold was a late addition to the Seahawks' injury report on Thursday, the last day of practice ahead of the divisional round, as a limited practice participant with an oblique injury. Come game time, he seemed completely unaffected by the injury and the 49ers' defense. Darnold played an efficient brand of football, connecting on 12 of his 17 throws for 124 yards and a touchdown. With an extra day of rest ahead of the NFC Championship on Jan. 25, Darnold could be back to full strength when Seattle returns to action with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Loser: Kyle Shanahan It was a rough overall year for Kyle Shanahan's 49ers. His top six highest-paid players missed a combined 64 games including the playoffs. All-Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa (torn ACL), All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner (fractured and dislocated ankle) and All-Pro tight end George Kittle (torn Achilles) all suffered what became season-ending injuries. To add insult to injury, Shanahan's 49ers were absolutely dominated by Mike Macdonald's Seahawks all season long. San Francisco concluded its 2025 season scoring a total of 26 points in three games versus the Seahawks. That is tied for the fewest points scored by any team among 76 single-season head-to-head matchups with three games in the Super Bowl era, since 1966, according to CBS Sports Research. The 1994 Pittsburgh Steelers also held the Cleveland Browns to a combined 26 points across three matchups. The 49ers were decimated by injuries and embarrassed by an NFC West rival over and over again. It doesn't get much worse than that. Fewest points scored in head-to-head matchups with three games, Super Bowl eraPoints scoredOpponent49ers (2025)26SeahawksBrowns (1994)26SteelersColts (1971)28DolphinsBuccaneers (1997)29PackersPatriots defeat Texans 28-16\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winners: Patriots' defense and LB coach Zak KuhrThe Patriots now have more playoff wins (two) than touchdowns allowed (one) this postseason. Their one touchdown allowed is tied for the fewest touchdowns allowed across the wild card and divisional rounds in the 21st century. The other two teams who accomplished this feat, the 2000 Baltimore Ravens and the 2006 Indianapolis Colts, both won the Super Bowl. The Patriots turned the Texans over a whopping five times on Sunday afternoon, and they continuously got their hands on the football. \nNew England's 14 passes defended ranks as the most by any team in a playoff game since the 2004 Philadelphia Eagles' 17 in the divisional round against the Minnesota Vikings. The players on the field obviously deserve the majority of the credit but fill-in defensive play caller Zak Kuhr, the team's linebackers coach, also deserves some shine. Defensive coordinator Terrell Williams took a leave of absence to battle prostate cancer after Week 1, so Kuhr has been tasked with calling the team's defensive plays. New England was the NFL's No. 4 scoring defense (18.8 points per game allowed) in the regular season, and has leveled up in the regular season. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Loser: C.J. StroudDepending on who you ask, C.J. Stroud's faceplant against the Patriots overshadows Josh Allen's four-turnover outing against the Broncos. Stroud completed just 20 of his 47 passes (42.5%) for 212 yards, a touchdown and four interceptions. That effort combined with his slog in Houston's wild card road win at the Pittsburgh Steelers makes Stroud the first player in NFL playoff history with five or more interceptions (five) and five or more fumbles (five) in a single postseason. His 10 combined fumbles and interceptions are also the most in the first two games played in a postseason in the last 35 seasons, per CBS Sports Research. \nThat's the same amount Stroud had across 14 regular-season games in 2025. He will be extension eligible this offseason, but after producing a historic stinker in the 2025 postseason, Houston should certainly think carefully about handing Stroud a massive pay day on a multiyear extension. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winner: Drake Maye and his PROn the one hand, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye became the first New England quarterback to throw for three passing touchdowns in a playoff game since Tom Brady did so in the 2017 season's Super Bowl LII in the win over the Texans. He also became the first quarterback with three passing touchdowns in a winning effort over Houston's vaunted defense this season. However, Maye needs to send Edible Arrangements to both Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud for both of their performances against his Patriots' defense this postseason because they have distracted from his own playoff struggles. \nMaye is the first quarterback since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger to win multiple playoff games while taking at least five sacks in multiple games in a single postseason. His pocket awareness has been extremely lacking in these playoffs between the sacks and his fumbling issues: Maye has fumbled six times for three turnovers while also throwing an interception in both games played in these playoffs. Three of them were in the first half of New England's victory over Houston, and he was incredibly fortunate only one was recovered by the Texans for a takeaway. In eight playoff quarters, Maye has five turnovers. Against the top-seeded Broncos and their NFL-best pass rush, playing as loose with the football like he has in the divisional and wild card rounds will lead to the Patriots watching the Super Bowl from the couch. Just ask Josh Allen. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Loser: Will Campbell's future at left tackleThere's no way around it: New England Patriots left tackle Will Campbell has been rough this postseason, especially in a winning effort against the Texans' vaunted defense. First-team All-Pro edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. and second-team All-Pro edge rusher Danielle Hunter are the best pass rush duo in the NFL, but Campbell struggled mightily on Sunday: he allowed two sacks and four quarterback pressures. His performance in the Patriots' 16-3 wild card round win over the Los Angeles Chargers wasn't much better: he surrendered five quarterback pressures and a sack. There was some worry when Campbell, the fourth overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, was coming out in the draft about his wingspan, and it appears those concerns were legitimate. Campbell, who is listed at 6-6, 319 pounds, was measured as having 32 5/8\" arms at the NFL Scouting Combine. Offensive tackles with longer arms have a better opportunity to prevent edge rushers from plowing into their chest because of better reach. Patriots 2010's All-Decade Team left guard Logan Mankins' arm length was 33 3/8\" -- longer than Campbell's. Like Campbell at LSU, Mankins was a left tackle at Fresno State. However, he moved inside to guard in the pro's. Perhaps Campbell would be better equipped to protect Maye if doing so from the interior. Maye is the only quarterback since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger to be sacked five times in multiple games in a single postseason and win those games. The Patriots may not be so lucky going forward against the Broncos in the AFC Championship game and in future playoff runs. Rams prevail over Bears 20-17 in overtime\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winner & loser: Caleb WilliamsChicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams provided the total Caleb Williams' experience in the Bears' season-ending 20-17 divisional round loss against the Los Angeles Rams. He threw for 257 yards, two touchdowns and a career-high three interceptions while completing just 23 of his 42 throws (54.7%). William tossed a game-tying, 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth-and-4 to tight end Cole Kmet while fading away over multiple Rams defenders that was one of the most clutch, jaw-dropping throws in recent NFL playoff memory. After he retreated backward down field, Williams' throw traveled 51.2 yards in the air, the most on a red zone passing touchdown in 10 seasons, per CBS Sports Research. That touchdown pass was also thrown 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage, the most on any completion in the past 10 seasons, according to CBS Sports Research. \nFor as great as Williams' touchdown throw was, his pass that ended Chicago's ensuing drive was equally as horrific. He sailed a throw over a seemingly open Luther Burden III for an interception to Rams safety Kamren Curl when all the Bears needed to score in overtime was a field goal after Los Angeles' punt. Some view the pass as an underthrow by Williams to DJ Moore. Ironically, Williams had time in the pocket and set his feet before making that mind-numbing pass. It's almost as if when Williams has more time to think when dropping back to pass, it causes him to overcomplicate lesser degree of difficulty throws. Williams' 14.6% off target throw rate was the highest in the NFL in 2025 among the league's 33 qualified quarterbacks. Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy was barely ahead of Williams with a 14.4% off target throw rate. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winner & loser: Sean McVayThe Los Angeles Rams averaged a solid 4.1 yards per carry against the Chicago Bears, but head coach Sean McVay dialed up 42 passes for Matthew Stafford in the Chicago snow to just 30 designed runs. He was fortunate his squad survived to live another day after that resulted in Stafford completing just 20 passes for a 47.6% completion percentage. McVay will need to be much better with his play calling against the Seahawks' No. 1 scoring defense in the NFC Championship game. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Winner: Harrison MevisThe Los Angeles Rams kicker nailed the game-winning, 42-yard field goal in overtime to send his squad to the NFC Championship game, and it was the first game-winning field goal of his entire career. Kickers get destroyed when they fail in the clutch, but Mevis deserves a shoutout for coming through in a big spot in his first time in that situation in the playoffs. \n            ",

The Rams are now headed to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2021, a season that ended with them winning the Super Bowl. In the NFC title game, the Rams will be heading to Seattle to face the Seahawks for the third time this season. The teams split their two regular-season meetings with the Rams winning in Week 11 (21-19) and the Seahawks winning in Week 16 (38-37). The Seahawks earned their way to the NFC Championship by absolutely destroying the 49ers in a 41-6 win on Saturday night. The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years. In the AFC, the Denver Broncos are headed to the conference title game after beating the Buffalo Bills, 33-30 in overtime, in what was easily the wildest game of the divisional round. The Broncos' vaunted defense forced five turnovers, including four from Josh Allen, who threw two interceptions while also losing two fumbles. The top-seeded Broncos will now host New England in the AFC title game with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line. The Patriots advanced on Sunday after beating the Texans, 28-16. The Broncos and Patriots are facing each other in the AFC title game for the third time in 13 years. The two previous meetings were both played in Denver and the Broncos won both of them. If the Broncos are going to get to the Super Bowl this year, they're going to have to do it without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury against Buffalo. For the Patriots, it will mark their first trip to the conference title game since 2018 in what ended up being the final appearance by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Divisional Round scheduleSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play.

    "body": "\n        The first tournament of the 2026 PGA Tour season produced a winner who has made a habit of raising trophies in his limited time on the circuit. Chris Gotterup blended power and touch like a seasoned veteran at the 2026 Sony Open as the third-year player crafted a masterclass on Sunday with a final-round 64 to put him at 16 under for the tournament, two strokes clear of runner-up Ryan Gerard.Gotterup's triumph at Waialae Country Club marks his third on the PGA Tour in as many seasons as he entered the winner's circle in Myrtle Beach his rookie year before outclassing Rory McIlroy at the Scottish Open last summer. The 26-year-old now trails only McIlroy (eight) and Scottie Scheffler (four) among active players in terms of consecutive seasons with a PGA Tour win. He is also the sixth player since 2024 to collect three or more wins.After opening his season with a 7-under 63, Gotterup entered the final round at 10 under and two strokes behind Davis Riley, the 54-hole leader. Riley had converted one of his previous two 54-hole leads on the PGA Tour and looked comfortable in the position early with two birdies in his first five holes.However, just as Riley appeared to be settling into his own, a rough three-hole stretch saw him pencil bogey, bogey, double bogey onto his scorecard. The door flew wide open, and Gotterup stepped through.\nThe big-hitting right-hander overpowered the classic Seth Raynor design, chopping off doglegs and taking egregious lines off the tee, doing so without sacrificing any semblance of accuracy. Four front-nine birdies saw him capture the lead by himself before he took full control of the tournament in the middle of his back nine.\nFor all his power off the tee, Gotterup got going thanks to his touch on the greens. He dialed up birdie connections from 21 feet on No. 12, 26 feet on No. 13 and 12 feet on No. 17 to put the tournament on ice just as Gerard was beginning to breathe down his neck.With only the par-5 finisher remaining, Gotterup flighted another beauty into the middle of the fairway. A layup, a wedge to the middle of the green and two putts were all that remained as Gotterup stepped up to the challenge and in doing so may have stepped up in class. Grade: A+\nHere are some of the other notable finishes on the 2026 Sony Open leaderboard.T4. Robert MacIntyre (-12): MacIntyre entered the week as the third-highest-ranked player in the field, and he looked the part on Sunday. The world No. 8 fired a final-round 63 -- the lowest of the day -- that included five front-nine birdies and zero dropped shots. MacIntyre was finally able to combine his approach play and putting and noted his frustrations on the greens earlier in the week had boiled over so much that he snapped his putter on Friday. There was none of that over the weekend as he started his season on a high note.\"This is one of my favorite golf tournaments of the year, to be honest,\" MacIntyre said. \"This is one of the best golf courses we play all year. Any one of the guys out there can play this golf course on their day. You don't have to bomb it. You can be short. It's just a proper test of golf, more like what we would play in Europe when we go to Valderrama, Belgium. You got to shape the ball. Obviously, the breeze gets up, but yeah, this is a great start. A lot more to come. \"But always a massive reminder of attitude has to be spot on. Last year, I felt like I done a great job of that. Yeah, I think expectations first two rounds have kind of affected me with that, but yeah, starting to manage it better. Obviously nice when you're playing well. It's easier to manage. Something I really got to switch on for the rest of the year.\" Grade: A-\nT13. Hideki Matsuyama (-9): The former tournament champion snuck his way into the weekend thanks to some late-round heroics on Friday and parlayed that into a strong Moving Day. Matsuyama was sensational from tee to green on Saturday in particular, carding a third-round 65 that featured seven birdies and just about nothing made on the greens. Matsuyama pushed it as deep as 9 under through his first five holes in the final round, but two bogeys and no birdies across his next 11 holes put any chance of a Sunday surge to bed. Grade: BT24. Jordan Spieth (-7): There were plenty of positive signs for those in the Spieth camp as he opened with two straight 68s before a Sunday 69. At various points of the tournament, he flashed in all areas of the game, but he just seemed allergic to momentum. Every time he took one step forward, he took one step back and was never able to create a snowball effect of rolling one quality hole into another. That could stem from multiple areas, but close-range putting is a place to start. \"I thought I kicked some rust off,\" Spieth said. \"I thought it was better than a month ago. Certainly, a lot of positives to go off. Historically, I've had a really hard time on these greens; that continued this week. But I'll go into some more familiar ones coming up the next few events. I got either a week or two weeks, depending on when I play next, to kind of trim the fat a little bit and get tighter and more consistent. \n\"But I was very happy with the control of the ball, especially in the conditions. Then today was a day-to-day take advantage and got off to a nice start, and unfortunately, was a just little off today with the striking and with the putting. Days like that happen. You kind of hope they happen on Monday and not on Sunday. It was a little bit of an off day, but all in all, coming into the week, I felt pretty confident about where things were at, so I would've liked to maybe finish higher. It was a nice finish, birdieing the last couple and feeling like I can take some momentum into the beginning of the season and hopefully get on a nice little run.\" Grade: C+\nT40. Vijay Singh (-5): Amid outside criticism for using his career money list exemption this season, the soon-to-be 63-year-old beat players like Brian Harman, Tom Kim, Collin Morikawa and Keegan Bradley in his first non-major start on the PGA Tour since the 2021 Honda Classic. Spanning even further back, the finish represents Singh's first made cut on the PGA Tour since the 2020 Memorial. It is unknown just how much the three-time major champion will play on the PGA Tour this season (he is not in next week's field at The American Express), but so far so good through the first week. Grade: CMC. Collin Morikawa: On a golf course that was perfect for him on paper, Morikawa penned an underwhelming two-round performance. The two-time major champion struggled with his swing in the calm conditions Thursday morning and watched as his putting problems persisted into Friday afternoon. Morikawa had a chance late in the second round to recover from his opening 72 and make the cut, but a couple of misses from short range across his final three holes were the final nails in his coffin. Grade: F\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Golden Knights have a penchant for making waves on the trade market, and it appears as if they have set another in motion Sunday night. Las Vegas has acquired veteran defenseman Rasmus Andersson from the Calgary Flames, dished out a nice return to secure the deal, according to Elliotte Friedman of SportsnetAs part of the Golden Knights' acquisition, the Flames have agreed to retain 50% of Andersson's $4.55 million contract. Las Vegas is sending back to Calgary a first-round pick in the 2027 NHL Draft, a conditional 2027 second-round pick, defenseman Zach Whitecloud and defensive prospect Abram Weibe.If the Golden Knights win the Stanley Cup this season, the second-round pick will become a future first-round selection, per Friedman.With Alex Pietrangelo out for the season due to a serious hip injury, the Golden Knights had a void in their top four. They've now filled that gap with one of the best options on the trade market.\nThe compensation sent over by Las Vegas is particularly significant considering Andersson is playing on the final year of his current contract and the deal did not include agreement on a contract extension. The Golden Knights have consequently surrendered premium future assets for a rental player. An extension could be announced anytime over the next few months, of course, but it's still a gamble on the part of general manager Kelly McCrimmon, who hasn't shied away from bold moves in the past.The question now is whether Andersson was the right player on whom to gamble. There was a time when he was considered an underrated star on the back end, particularly when Darryl Sutter was behind the Flames' bench from 2020-23. Andersson posted solid five-on-five numbers, including a plus-31 goal differential, while also tallying 120 points in 217 games, per Natural Stat Trick.However, since Ryan Huska took over in 2023-24, Andersson's numbers have tumbled. Part of that has to do with Sutter taking his elite defensive system with him when he left, and another part of it is the overall deterioration of the roster.\nStill, the underlying metrics haven't been kind to Andersson recently.With Huska leading the Flames, Andersson has a 48.1% expected goals share and a minus-24 goal differential at five-on-five. His offensive production has also taken a slight step back, too, with 100 points in 207 games.The Golden Knights will try to get Andersson back into a strong defensive environment where shortcomings can be concealed while allowing him to showcase his offensive skillset. If they can get Andersson back to his 2022-23 form, no one will care about the acquisition cost.As for the Flames, they're a team clearly in rebuild mode, and it seemed unlikely that Andersson would re-sign next summer. Securing a first-round pick (as well as a conditional second-round pick) without a sign-and-trade was probably fair value in this instance. Whitecloud is a solid depth defenseman, and Weibe is more of a long-term project.\nThis is a classic example of a trade that made plenty of sense for both sides. The Flames can load up on draft capital as they try to kickstart a rebuild, and the Golden Knights are focused on winning now as they gear up for what should be a gauntlet in the Western Conference playoffs.Las Vegas currently has the second-best odds to win the West at +470, according to FanDuel; however, the Colorado Avalanche (+125) are the clear favorites, and the Edmonton Oilers (+500) aren't far behind.\n            ",

With that type of potency, no team has more against-the-spread victories than Los Angeles' 12 this season, while the Bears are just 2-7 ATS over their last nine divisional round playoff games. The L.A. offense sometimes overshadows the other side of the ball, which is elite in itself. No team has allowed fewer rushing scores than Los Angeles, which also finds itself in the top 10 in interceptions, sacks and passer rating allowed. That defense contrasts with what Chicago offers as the Bears rank 29th in total defense and allowed 6.0 yards per play in the regular season, which was the third-most in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bears can coverThe Windy City has certainly provided a home-field advantage for the Bears who are 8-2 both straight-up and ATS over their last 10 home games versus the Rams. This season, the team is 11-4-1 ATS over its last 16 games, while the Rams are the only team playing this weekend that lost versus the spread in the Wild Card Round. The Rams have lost against the line in three of their last four road games, and Chicago's highly efficient offense can exploit Los Angeles' suddenly leaky defense. No team has committed fewer turnovers than the Bears, who also possess top-10 rankings in both points scored and yards gained. Meanwhile, the Rams have given up an average of 30 points over their last five contests and have allowed multiple passing touchdowns in five of their last seven games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears     picksSportsLine's model has simulated Bears vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 52 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Jarrett Stidham is not entering uncharted waters as a backup quarterback starting an NFL playoff game. Ironically, the Denver Broncos' opponent in Sunday's AFC Championship Game, the New England Patriots, fell to a backup QB eight years ago in Super Bowl LII.Stidham will start in place of Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury during the final moments of Denver's win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Divisional Round. Nick Foles, who replaced Carson Wentz and started the Super Bowl for the Eagles after the 2017 season, reminded Broncos fans that history suggests they should be encouraged ... while trolling the Patriots by recalling a game they would rather forget.\"Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours,\" Foles wrote on social media. \"I feel for Bo and the team, and I'm sending prayers for a strong recovery.   A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.\"\nBroncos fans would certainly love it if Stidham had a performance similar to the one Foles put together against New England on football's biggest stage. Foles went 28 of 43 for 377 yards and three touchdowns that night, leading Philadelphia to a 41-33 win over the then-defending Super Bowl champions.Foles' MVP performance also included being on the receiving end of the \"Philly Special\" that instantly became part of Super Bowl lore. \nWhile Stidham will be in a similar spot this Sunday, there are a few clear differences between his situation and the one Foles found himself in eight years ago. \nFoles had been entrenched in the Eagles' starting lineup for roughly six weeks before facing the Patriots in the Super Bowl. That stretch included five starts and two playoff games. Conversely, Sunday will mark Stidham's first extended playing time in a non-exhibition game since the 2023 season. In fact, Stidham hasn't even thrown a pass in a non-exhibition game in over two years.\nFoles' performance also came in the backdrop of Bill Belichick's baffling decision to bench cornerback Malcolm Butler, the hero during the Patriots' Super Bowl win over the Seattle Seahawks three years earlier. It's rather unlikely that current New England coach Mike Vrabel will be benching any of his star defenders next Sunday against Stidham. However, while Foles faced the Patriots on a neutral site, Stidham will benefit from the friendly confines and altitude of Empower Field at Mile High. Rest assured that the Broncos' faithful will give Stidham the silence he needs to run the Broncos' offense while going into a frenzied pitch anytime Patriots QB Drake Maye is on the field. \nStidham appears to have the belief of his teammates and coaches, including Broncos head man Sean Payton. \"He will be ready to go and ready for the moment,\" Payton said following Denver's win over Buffalo. \"[Stidham's] great strength is his mental aptitude and his progressions in understanding plays. … He's very accurate. He has a lot to his ball.\"Payton alluded to Foles and former New York Giants QB Jeff Hostetler, who relieved injured starter Phil Simms late in the 1990 season before leading New York to an upset win over the Bills in Super Bowl XXV. \n\"Historically speaking, all bets weren't off with Hostetler, [and] they weren't off in Philly [with Foles],\" Payton said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If Indiana beats Miami on Monday night to win the College Football Playoff National Championship, the school will have completed one of the most shockingly fast turnarounds in sports. Just two seasons ago, the Hoosiers were an also-ran in the Big Ten, to put it politely. Now, under Curt Cignetti, they're a national powerhouse.That got us thinking about some of the quickest turnarounds in modern sports history. Which teams came from nowhere only to reach the pinnacle of their sport in just a few short years later after a dramatic turnaround? Some may have forgotten how bad a legacy team like the Boston Celtics were prior to their 2007-08 championship run. And then there was an expansion team like the 1997 Florida Marlins, who won it all in just their fifth year of existence.Sometimes, all it takes is one key player to make all the difference. Just ask the 1999 St. Louis Rams or the 2010 Auburn Tigers. Those squads got major shots in the arm from the right spot at the right time, and then just rode that to championships.Before Indiana tries to complete its dizzying ascent to the college football throne, let's look back on some of the fastest turnarounds ever in the sports world.\nNew York Rangers (1992-94)Despite boasting a wealth of talent, the 1992-93 Rangers just couldn't put it all together and finished last in the Patrick Division at 34-39-11. Perhaps the biggest issue was that star defenseman Brian Leetch was limited to just 36 games due to injury. On top of that, Mike Richter had one of his worst seasons between the pipes with a 3.82 GAA and a .886 save percentage.The very next season, Leetch was fully healthy, and he tallied 79 points from the blue line. Forward Adam Graves exploded for 52 goals, and Richter bounced back with 42 wins, a 2.57 GAA and a .910 save percentage. After a year in which nothing went right, the puck bounced the Rangers' way constantly in 1993-94, and the team rolled to a first-place finish.The Rangers made quick work of their first two playoff opponents, going 8-1 against the New York Islanders and Washington Capitals. Then, with the Rangers down in the three games to two to the Devils in conference final, Mark Messier guaranteed a road Game 6 (at New Jersey) before advancing and taking out the Vancouver Canucks in seven games in the Stanley Cup Final. Leetch took home the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nFlorida Marlins (1993-97)Let's first all agree that time is relative. The Florida Marlins lost 98 games in their 1993 debut, and then -- along with the rest of Major League Baseball -- lost games in its second and third seasons due to the 1994 strike. Fans in South Florida would have been downright giddy at the prospect of going 80-82 in 1996, but then came the unthinkable: Winning a World Series championship the following season, in only the team's fifth year of existence.Seeking a win-now strategy, team owner Wayne Huizenga busted out the checkbook heading into that 1997 season, signing veterans everywhere, including left fielder Moises Alou, third baseman Bobby Bonilla and pitcher Alex Fernandez. Jim Leyland, a manager with World Series experience, was also brought on board, and those acquisitions joined a roster that already had a young Gary Sheffield and rookie shortstop Édgar Rentería. Darren Daulton and Craig Counsell were picked up at the trade deadline, and in the playoffs, Cuban rookie pitching sensation Liván Hernández sparkled, winning NLCS and World Series MVP honors.A five-year turnaround might not seem fast-fast, but when you consider the team Florida beat in that 1997 Fall Classic was a Cleveland franchise that -- to that point -- had gone five decades without a World Series title, yeah, we'd say what the Marlins did was relatively quick.\nSt. Louis Rams (1998-99)The Rams went 4-12 in 1998, and they did so with a Hall of Fame quarterback sitting on the bench. Instead, Tony Banks led an offense that scored just 17.8 points per game.Going into the 1999 season, Kurt Warner wasn't even supposed to be the starter. The Rams brought in Trent Green, but he tore his ACL in the preseason. That gave Warner his shot, and he didn't miss. He threw for 4,353 yards and 41 touchdowns while Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt and Az-Zahir Hakim formed a three-headed monster at receiver.Joining Warner in the backfield was running back Marshall Faulk, acquired from the Indianapolis Colts via trade after the 1998 season. Faulk totaled 2,429 yards from scrimmage and 12 touchdowns and he finished second in MVP voting. The Rams went on to win Super Bowl XXXIV in early 2000 in a 23-16 thriller against the Tennessee Titans.\nDetroit Shock (2002-03)The Shock won just nine games in 2002, and they were the only team to finish the year with single-digit victories. Detroit was especially dreadful on defense, allowing 70.8 points per game, which was one of the worst marks in the WNBA. Of course, that overall record disguises a positive upward trend that occurred after Bill Laimbeer took over for Greg Williams, who led the team to an 0-10 record. The Shock went 9-13 under Laimbeer, and they carried that momentum into the 2003 season.The defense didn't improve much in 2003, but the offense took off with 75.1 points per game. Swin Cash led the way with 16.6 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. The biggest addition was No. 3 overall pick Cheryl Ford, who won Rookie of the Year with 10.8 points and 10.4 rebounds per game.The Shock took down the Cleveland Rockers and Connecticut Sun in the first two rounds of the postseason before beating the Los Angeles Sparks in the WNBA Finals.\nBoston Celtics (2006-08)The 2006-07 Celtics were about as far away from an NBA title as you can be. Their 24-58 record was the worst in the East, and only the Memphis Grizzlies had a worst record overall. An injury limited Paul Pierce to 47 games, and the team around him collapsed. The following offseason, general manager Danny Ainge got to work.Boston swung blockbuster deals, landing both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, to assemble a Big Three. That trio -- combined with ascending players like Rajon Rondo and Glen Davis -- proved to be lethal. The Celtics had the best record in the NBA in 2007-08, and they fought their way through an arduous postseason.Two series went seven games and the other two ended after Game 6, one of which being an NBA Finals championship over the Kobe Bryant and Boston's arch-rival Los Angeles Lakers.\nAuburn Tigers (2008-10)In 2008, the Tommy Tuberville era on The Plains came to an unceremonious end with a 5-7 season. The Tigers were 2-6 in SEC play, and they scored just 17.3 points per game, which ranked 111th in the country.The following season was the start of Gene Chizik's tenure as coach, and while there were some improvements, Auburn still had its fair share of flaws. With Chris Todd and Ben Tate leading the way on offense, Auburn's offense rebounded to 33.3 points per game. Unfortunately, the defense didn't hold up its end of the bargain, and the Tigers finished with a respectable 8-5 record, although they were 3-5 in league play.In 2010, Auburn found lightning in a bottle thanks to one of the greatest seasons from any college football player ever. Cam Newton came in to play quarterback, and he was a one-man wrecking crew. Newton totaled 4,327 yards and accounted for 51 touchdowns, and those gaudy numbers earned him the Heisman Trophy. Thanks to Newton, the Tigers ran the table and beat Oregon to win the BCS National Championship.\nLeicester City FC (2014-16)There are long shots, and there are LONG SHOTS. Leicester City's drive to the 2015-16 Premier League title doesn't only fall in the all caps category it practically screams in 48-point font that there won't be anything like it ever again. Claudio Ranieri's men were an unfathomable 5,000-1 shots before the season began, but there was, indeed, a chance.After losing half of their game in their first Premier League season of 2014-25, For magic to happen that season, the club needed a few things to go right. First was that the traditional powerhouses in England all struggled to some degree or another with Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool all falling apart while Arsenal and Tottenham narrowly failed to catch the unlikely winners. From there it was the magical alchemy of a trio of yet to be appreciated stars in N'Golo Kante, Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy surrounded by a consistent, workman like set of role players that danced between the raindrops to become the unlikeliest story in Premier League history.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Week 16 NFL schedule features 16 more games, including several with potential playoff ramifications. One such game is a Saturday NFC North battle between the Green Bay Packers (9-4-1) and the Chicago Bears (10-4). Chicago is favored by 1 point as Jordan Love and the Packers face Caleb Williams and the Bears. Green Bay has won nine of the past 10 meetings, including a 28-21 victory at Lambeau Field two weeks ago. Another key matchup between two contenders is the NFC South matchup between the division co-leading Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The teams are tied with 7-7 records and play each other two times in the final three weeks. The Buccaneers enter as 3-point road favorites. Sunday's largest spreads include Raiders vs. Texans (-14.5), Bills (-10.5) vs. Browns and Steelers vs. Lions (-7). Among the worst injuries suffered in Week 15 include Patrick Mahomes (knee) of the Chiefs and Micah Parson (knee) of the Packers, which have affected the NFL spreads in their respective games. Before making any Week 16 NFL picks or NFL score predictions on those games or others, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over/under and money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game.

    "body": "\n        NBA All-Star voting kicked off this week. In the NBA's desperate attempt to fix a game that's been broken for a while, the league is going with yet another new format, pitting Americans against international stars.Per usual, 24 players will be selected, with 12 from each conference. No position requirements. The American team(s) will have at least 16 players, while the international team will have a minimum of eight. If those numbers aren't reached organically between the voting process for starters -- fans account for 50%, with players and media each getting 25% -- and the reserves selected by NBA head coaches, the commissioner will add extra All-Stars. Confused? Just put it out of your mind and know that a bunch of guys will be All-Stars and they'll play something kinda resembling basketball that weekend and then everyone will probably complain about it afterward. Problems with the format aside, there are some players who have never been All-Stars who are deserving of the honor this season. Not everyone will make the cut, of course, but what follows is the argument in favor of naming some first-time selections. The operative word there being \"some.\" We're not listing every potential first-time All-Star. There are notable names absent for various reasons, including but not limited to Franz Wagner (out several weeks with a high ankle sprain which could sink his chances), Amen Thompson (Kevin Durant and Alperen Sengun are locks and it's hard to imagine the Rockets getting three in a loaded conference) and Dillon Brooks (having a career-best scoring season but is unlikely to win anyone's voting popularity contest). That said, here's the case for nine worthy first timers in no particular order.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Jamal Murray, Denver NuggetsNikola Jokić has famously never had an All-Star or All-NBA teammate. That should change this season with Murray making a strong case for his first All-Star appearance. The 28-year-old is averaging 24.9 points, 4.4 rebounds and 6.8 assists with 50.1/44.7/89.6 shooting splits. All but his free-throw percentage are career highs. He's also one of three Nuggets -- along with Aaron Gordon and Joker -- to have a 50-point game this season.\nThe knock against Murray has always been consistency. He'd flash and then disappear at times during the regular season. This season, in the absence of starters Christian Braun (ankle) and Gordon (hamstring), Murray has been the omnipresent 1A option Joker has always longed to have at his side. If he's not an All-Star this season, it's never happening. Justice for Jamal. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Austin Reaves, Los Angeles Lakers Another late-20-something putting up eye-popping numbers. Reaves is averaging career highs in points (27.8), rebounds (5.6) and assists (6.7) in 36.9 minutes per game while shooting 50.3% from the floor. Aside from play making and scoring, he's really leveled up on getting to the foul line. Not everyone loves it, but foul grifting is a skill and Reaves is one the best in the league. He's getting to the line 9.1 times per game shooting and 87.5%. With Luka Dončić and LeBron James out in October, he dropped 51 points on the Kings in Sacramento and followed that up the next night with 41 against Portland at home. He's also undeniably first-team All-Interview.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jalen Johnson, Atlanta HawksWelcome to Jalen Johnson is the Best Player on the Hawks Island. Proud to say the population is growing in earnest. Johnson is averaging 22.8 points, 10.5 rebounds, 8.2 assists and 1.6 steals (all career highs) with 51.6/38.5/81.3 shooting splits. The 3-point and free-throw numbers are significant improvements. Johnson had never shot better than 35.5% from deep or 74.6% from the line. He's also become a counting stats monster. This week he posted his fourth-straight triple-double, becoming just the third player in NBA history to do so before turning 24. The other two are Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson. Pretty good company. \n        \n            \n                Are the Hawks better without Trae Young? We're about to find out\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma City ThunderThis is separate from All-Star selections, but qualifying for season awards requires playing a minimum of 65 games. If not for that, Victor Wembanyama would be the runaway winner for Defensive Player of the Year, but clearing the threshold will be difficult considering he's already missed 12 games. That windup is simply to say, if it's not Wemby, the DPOY might very well be Holmgren. He's anchored the league's best defense and is currently the betting favorite to win the award (+145 at FanDuel). If it wasn't for the fact that the Thunder are blowing out most of their opponents by a comical margin (OKC's 16.8 point differential is the best in NBA history, improving on the record the Thunder set last season), Holmgren might be playing more in the fourth quarter instead of averaging 28 minutes per game. In that world, imagine an uptick on all his counting stats, particularly his 1.5 blocks per game.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Deni Avdija, Portland Trailblazers The Blazers sometimes get overlooked. That happens when you're 10-16 and play late-night West Coast games. But real hoop heads recognize that Avdija is having a breakout season. The 24-year-old is quietly putting up reliable numbers, averaging a career-best 25.5 points and 6.3 assists, along with 7.2 rebounds. He's also taking 6.4 3-point attempts per game and hitting 37.7%, while getting to the line 9.6 times per game and shooting 81.2% -- all of which are career highs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Norm Powell, Miami HeatYou know who could use someone with Powell's skill set? The Clippers. Instead the Heat are putting his instant offense to good use. Powell has improved on last season's breakout campaign in LA by averaging career highs in Miami in points (24.4) and rebounds (3.7) while shooting 49.3% from the field and 42.9% from 3 on seven attempts per game. Powell is 32. It's rare for someone to have the best seasons of his career after turning 30, but that's what he's done the last two years. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Josh Giddey, Chicago BullsI hesitated to include Giddey. I'm not sure his brand of basketball lends itself to winning when he's the main guy. After a hot start, the Bulls have lost eight of their last 10 and fallen to 11-15 (though they did just beat a Cavs team that's suddenly forgotten how to shoot ). That's not all on him, of course, and making the All-Star team is generally about numbers, not the win-loss column. Giddey is posting serious counting stats: 20.3 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 8.9 apg, all of which are career-highs. He's also shooting a career-best 47.6% from the floor and 40.4% from deep. That might not translate to much more than another play-in berth for the Bulls -- if that -- but the numbers look good on the paper. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Jalen Duren, Detroit PistonsThe Pistons are still in first place in the Eastern Conference. Cade Cunningham is the biggest reason why, but Duren has certainly done his part. The 22-year-old is averaging a career-high 18 points along with 11 rebounds. He's posted double doubles in 15 of the 23 games he's played, and he's fourth in the league in rebounding. He's also gotten much better defensively where he's averaging nearly one steal and block per game. For a team that dominates the paint and stacks wins because of it, Duren has been hugely valuable. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Derrick White, Boston CelticsSome people will blanch at this one because he's shooting 39.6% from the floor and 33.8% from three. Fair criticism! But hear me out. With Jayson Tatum out with an Achilles, and Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis shipped out during the offseason, White was asked to take on more responsibility on the offensive end. Accordingly, his usage rate has spiked to a career-high 24.2. With the increased volume, he got off to a rough shooting start that didn't do his percentages any favors. But over the last month, a span of 13 games dating back to mid-November, he's starting to find a rhythm, shooting 44.9% from the field and 38.7% from deep. He's been a key reason why the surprising Celtics (15-11) are fourth in the Eastern Conference and Brad Stevens is saying \"nothing is holding us back\" from adding talent. \nBut the most impressive part of White's game is how disruptive he is on defense. The two-time All-Defense selection is averaging a career-best 1.4 steals and 1.2 blocks per game, making him one of only two players in the NBA with at least 30 blocks and 30 steals this season. He frequently makes plays where you end up thinking where did he just come from? Look how far he tracks back for this block on Daniss Jenkins.He probably won't be selected as an All-Star (again), but he's forever first-team All-Underrated. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe first chance to make an NFL SGP comes in the Week 16 'Thursday Night Football' contest between the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks. With L.A. 8-2 ATS over their last 10 matchups, backing the Rams (-1.5) to cover will be popular in a TNF same-game parlay, as will money line NFL bets, as Los Angeles has outright won seven of those 10. But your Seahawks vs. Rams SGP can also include NFL player props featuring the likes of Matthew Stafford, Sam Darnold and Puka Nacua.If this game is anything like their Week 11 meeting, then NFL prop bets may target Darnold and his interceptions. He threw four picks in the earlier loss to the Rams, so backing Over 0.5 interceptions with NFL prop odds of -147 could be attractive. There also may be Rams wideouts poised to hit their Overs with Davante Adams (hamstring) doubtful.

If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of 6-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Los Angeles vs. Seattle here.\nTop 'Thursday Night Football' SGP picksAfter simulating Seahawks vs. Rams, SportsLine's Machine Learning Model says Seahawks wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba goes Under 89.5 receiving yards (-114). Smith-Njigba's pace has slowed a bit after a blistering start. He averaged 119.4 receiving yards over his first 11 games, putting him on pace for a 2,000-yard season and the most in a year in NFL history. However, he's averaging just 76 receiving yards over his last three games and has to face one of the NFL's toughest defenses.The Rams have the No. 3 scoring defense and rank in the top 10 in yards per completion allowed and passing rating allowed and defensive sacks. Plus, with Darnold's four picks leading to the Rams beating Seattle in Week 11, there's a good chance the Seahawks lean more on the ground game this turn around. Add in that there's a nearly 90% chance of rain for Thursday night in addition to heavy winds in Seattle, and the passing game will be further hampered. Smith-Njigba is projected to have 73.9 receiving yards in a 4.5-star NFL prop that could be a part of a winning Thursday Night Football SGP. See which other TNF same-game parlay picks to make here.You can bet Smith-Njigba to go under 89.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make Rams vs. Seahawks SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has eight other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your Seahawks vs. Rams SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Thursday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top TNF same-game parlay picks you should target with your Rams vs. Seahawks predictions?

    "body": "\n        Harvard quarterback Jaden Craig is poised to become one of the most closely watched names in the upcoming transfer portal window when it opens Jan. 2. The Ivy League signal-caller is already garnering interest from a number of Power Four programs, and at least one College Football Playoff team has him as one of the top transfer quarterbacks on their big board, sources told 247Sports and CBS Sports. \nCraig's rise has been built on sustained production and efficiency rather than just hype. Over the past two seasons as Harvard's full-time starter, he threw for 5,299 yards and 58 touchdowns while completing 61% of his passes, cementing himself as the most prolific passer in program history. Former Harvard coach Tim Murphy has said Craig is the best quarterback he's seen at Harvard since Ryan Fitzpatrick in the early 2000s. Craig helped lead Harvard to its first FCS playoff appearance in 2025. Individually, he is a two-time finalist for the Walter Payton Award, the FCS equivalent of the Heisman Trophy, placing him among the most decorated players in the subdivision the past two seasons. NFL evaluators have also taken notice of Craig's skill set. One NFL scout told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz this summer that Craig stands out as a processor of the game.  \"Good decision-maker,\" the scout said. \"Really like his pocket presence and mobility. Stands tall. Full field reads, gets through progressions with natural pace. Worried about his arm strength. That's what would hold me back from (him) being draftable at the moment. Better athlete than I expected though and has escapability.\" \nFrom an analytical standpoint, Craig's production matches the film. He posted the seventh-best passing grade (90.6) among FCS quarterbacks with at least 300 dropbacks this season according to PFF, and his 30 big-time throws ranked second among that group.  In 2025 alone, Craig recorded five 300-yard passing games and five contests with three or more passing touchdowns. He had three 300-yard games and five multi-touchdown performances in 2024. 🏈 Jaden Craig's Harvard résumé\n   CategoryStatHarvard RankCareer passing yards6,0741stCareer passing touchdowns521stSingle-season passing touchdowns251stSingle-season passing yards2,8691stSingle-season completions2081stCareer completions4352ndCareer pass attempts7142ndSingle-season pass attempts3382nd (one shy of record)Once an unranked recruit out of Montclair (N.J.) Seton Hall Prep in the 2022 class, Craig now is anticipated to enter the portal rated as a three-star transfer and the No. 9 quarterback at this time, according to 247Sports' Cooper Petagna. Craig projects as one of the most intriguing quarterback options on the market this winter. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThursday night's big divisional matchup between the Seahawks and Rams has some watchability downside to it, thanks in large part to a low total and Davante Adams potentially not playing. But make no mistake: this is a heavyweight battle between maybe the best two teams in the NFC. And the stakes are massive: the Rams currently have a 53% chance of securing the No. 1 seed. If they win, that number spikes to 90%. That's an enormous amount of playoff seeding leverage.And of course, there's the NFC West title that's up for grabs: if the Seahawks win on Thursday, they can win out and take the title and host a playoff game. Lose and the Seahawks are very likely going to be on the road for Wild Card Weekend. \nSeattle's also missing tackle Charles Cross for this one, which isn't going to make Sam Darnold overcoming his issues with the Rams defense easy (four picks last game plus the ugly playoff loss while with the Vikings last year), which is notable if the Rams defense comes to play. We could be in for a rock fight here so be careful with touchdown scorer bets, but there's still plenty of meat on the bone for some props and best bets. Let's get some winners! If you're new to NFL betting or need a refresher, make sure to check out our NFL betting guide. Also make sure to check out the SportsLine Projection Model's forecast for the entire Rams vs. Seahawks game.Top straight bet (spread, money line or total)Rams +1.5\nI thought long and hard about taking the Rams on the money line for this game, but I think there's a very good chance we get a TNF nail-biter between these two powerhouses. With the various injuries and the stout prowess on the defensive side of the ball, we shouldn't see a blowout from either team. Even with Darnold having his worst game of the season, the Seahawks still kept things close with the Rams earlier in the year.And so I want the points with the Rams. Losing Adams is a big issue for sure. But they've got some nice young players who can step in and make some plays. Plus, the Rams have been rolling out 13 personnel a ton this year and should have multiple tight ends on the field a majority of the time. Matthew Stafford is the MVP and I expect him to play like it on Thursday night, even against a good Seahawks defense. Puka Nacua being healthy is massive and the Rams are running the ball really well right now with their personnel usage. Sean McVay's teams have scored 20+ against Mike McDonald in every single game they've matched up dating back to McDonald's days as Ravens defensive coordinator and I think something about the matchup just clicks for the Rams coach.We'll ride our boys once more. Rams vs. Seahawks player propsPuka Nacua over 7.5 receptions\nNothing is ever a given in football but this one feels really good. No Adams is going to mean even more focusing in on Nacua for Stafford, even if the defense doubles down on stopping him. I wouldn't be surprised if the Rams came out firing in the pass game early to try and get the Seahawks defense on its heels and we get Nacua to three or four catches early on. He's going to be the guy on third down as well and like Jaxon Smith-Njigba, even if a defense is keying in on Nacua, he's still likely to catch a ton of passes because he's such an elite short-yardage route runner. A mid-game visit to the medical tent is always a concern with Nacua, but it's probably our biggest fear in not hitting this prop. Kenneth Walker over 10.5 receiving yards\nLast week's narrow win over Indy notwithstanding, Walker's seen his targets spike decently over the last month plus. He has 27 targets on the season now and 15 of those have come in the last five weeks.That includes a three-target, three-catch, 44-yard receiving day against the Rams the last time these teams played. With the offensive line banged up and Darnold dealing with some demons with this defense, I think it's likely Klint Kubiak dials up some short stuff to the running backs to ease him in or alleviate the pass rush.  This is also a very low number and it's possible we could get there with a single catch. Jaxon Smith-Njigba over 6.5 receptions\nLike Nacua's receptions prop, we're not going to overthink this. JSN has been either the most dominant receiver in the league this year or the second-most dominant receiver in the league behind Nacua.He's an elite route runner and gets open on short-yardage spots, which sets up well with how the Seahawks will have to win in the passing game. Like Nacua, I greatly prefer the receptions number to the yardage, even though both can obviously get to their number. JSN's hit this number in all but four games this year and had nine catches against the Rams earlier this season, despite a game that finished with just 40 total points. TNF anytime touchdown scorer propsColby Parkinson\nExpect Parkinson to be a very popular pick for ATD this week in many different spots on these Internet streets, because he's been on a heater when it comes to scoring touchdowns. Parkinson's found the end zone a whopping six times over his last six games and with Adams extremely unlikely to play in this game, there's even more end-zone equity available via the vacated red-zone targets.This is also a nice price for someone who has been a top target for Stafford by the goal line and once Adams is ruled out, I would expect this number to drop a bit.A.J. Barner\nTight End Thursday lives on! Barner's got double usage in terms of his ability to score, as he's a good red-zone target for Darnold, but he's also the guy the Seahawks use in their tush push packages. We love the idea of backing a guy who can score rushing or passing, and Barner getting potential rushing looks if the Seahawks get to the one-yard line with this price above 2-1. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Are the Atlanta Hawks better without Trae Young? It's been the pervasive question surrounding this Hawks season to date. While we don't yet have an answer, what we can say fairly comfortably is that the version of the Hawks we've seen since Young went down with an MCL sprain is roughly as good, if not better, than any version of the team he played for. Just consider the numbers:The Hawks have a +2.1 net rating since Young went down. The best net rating Atlanta has posted over a full season in Young's career came in 2021, when they made the conference finals. It was +2.2.The Hawks started the season 1-3. Young went down early in their fifth game. They are now 14-9 in games Young hasn't finished. That's a winning percentage just below 61%. Atlanta has never won even 57% of its games across a full Young season, and the Hawks are 221-267 when he plays, meaning they've won around 45% of his career games.The Hawks have the NBA's No. 13-ranked defense since Young got hurt. Atlanta has never posted an above-average defensive rating over a full season with Young.The theoretical area in which the Hawks should be worse without Young is on offense, yet Atlanta ranks No. 12 since his injury. The obvious takeaway there is that Atlanta's athletic wings are dominating in transition, and there's some truth to that. The Hawks are the seventh-most efficient transition offense this season, according to Synergy Sports, and only the Heat and Bulls spend a greater proportion of their possessions in transition. But that doesn't mean the Hawks have made some great half-court sacrifice. Atlanta ranks 19th in half-court points per possession since Young hurt his knee, according to Cleaning the Glass, but they ranked 16th last year, and they haven't ranked higher than 14th since 2022, when they finished No. 1.Again, this doesn't tell us that the Hawks are better without Trae Young. It tells us that the version of the Hawks we've seen for most of this season is probably at least as good as any version of the Hawks Young played on. Those are wildly different points, especially considering how deep this roster is compared to the ones Young has largely played for.Jalen Johnson, today, is better than any player Young has ever played with. Nickeil Alexander-Walker has essentially morphed into the sort of backcourt partner Atlanta envisioned Dejounte Murray would be: a capable secondary ball-handler that brings high-level shooting and defense. Onyeka Okongwu may not quite be the prototypical Young big man, but he's more versatile and frankly valuable than Clint Capela has been for Atlanta in years. Dyson Daniels is great. The bench is full of shooters. There's a No. 1 overall pick here in Zaccharie Risacher going almost completely unnoticed. This team can be awesome. Young has never played on an awesome team.That might be changing pretty soon. Young has been upgraded to questionable on Atlanta's injury report for Thursday's game against the Charlotte Hornets. Whether he indeed returns Thursday nght or at some point in the near future, we are about to see how Young responds to playing with the best talent of his career. There's a world in which his presence vaults the Hawks into genuine Eastern Conference contention. He has led the best half-court offense in the NBA, after all, even if it came years ago. That's one of this group's weaknesses. Maybe Young's return supercharges the offense, but the defense remains afloat thanks to all of the athleticism the Hawks have accumulated.\nThere's also another equally plausible world in which Young proves more disruptive than helpful. He's one of the most heliocentric players in basketball, and nothing about Atlanta's playing style without him suggests they're equipped to reintegrate such a high-usage player. Atlanta is averaging over 308 passes per game since Young's injury, the fifth-most in the NBA. They ranked 17th in passes per game last season, and believe it or not, that represents growth for Young. Between the 2019-20 and 2023-24 seasons, the Hawks ranked slightly better than 27th on average. In this season's tiny sample, only James Harden holds the ball longer than the 5.69 seconds per touch Young does, and only Shai Gilgeous-Alexander tops his 5.5 dribbles per touch. Those numbers are more or less in line with Young's standard. They're also incompatible with the way the team is playing now. Aside from bench guard Keaton Wallace, no Hawk is averaging even 3.5 seconds per touch or four dribbles per touch. They're living and dying on quick decisions right now.Young has never played that way. He's taken baby steps in that direction, sure, but they're just that. As nice as it is to see Young set more ball-screens, he's never going to be an especially eager off-ball player. He scored 39 total points off of cuts last season, and he averaged less than one catch-and-shoot 3-point attempt per game. We're past baby steps, crawling and even walking. If Young is going to keep up with this new-look team, he's going to have to run with his younger teammates. While Atlanta will certainly welcome some uptick in half-court, pick-and-roll production, the impetus is now on Young to fit onto this team, not for the team to conform to him.Young was eligible for a contract extension last offseason. We know little about those negotiations, but a deal never materialized. The league-wide landscape has changed significantly since Young signed his max rookie extension. Teams are pinching pennies on sub-superstar-caliber players as the aprons force them into harder and harder choices. As Ja Morant and LaMelo Ball are also demonstrating, there just isn't that much interest around the league in small, high-usage point guards who can't defend. Young has a player option for the 2026-27 season, so there's time for his future to be figured out, but when he returns, he's not just auditioning for the Hawks. He's showing the rest of the league what he looks like in a healthier overall ecosystem.\nPlayers like Young are very often labeled as floor-raisers. They're so good at such a critical offensive staple (pick-and-roll shot-creation) that merely having them on the floor can usually at least get you into the play-in hunt. Sure enough, that's where Atlanta has been in recent years. But unless you're at Luka Dončić's level, such players have to diversify if they're going to raise ceilings, to amplify other great players and consistently push deep into the postseason. Right now, those are the players who get paid, who rosters are built around. Mikal Bridges nets five first-round picks in a trade because there's no question how he'd fit onto any roster in the NBA. Teams are hesitant to trade for players like Young because they come with several such questions, and his absence has proven that Atlanta's floor is high enough as it is. Their ambitions are grander now. The ceiling is what matters.The unprotected 2026 first-round pick the Hawks have from the Pelicans gives Atlanta a pretty easy potential out from a talent perspective. They're going to have a very strong prospect joining their existing core next season. They don't have to worry about losing Young as an asset for nothing. They're more than covered on that front, and while things have gone south for other reasons, last year's Clippers are a bit of a model for the ways in which just letting an overpriced player walk can be beneficial. Give a team that has Johnson, Daniels, Alexander-Walker, Okongwu and Risacher locked into reasonable contracts an extra $50 million in financial flexibility and an incoming high lottery pick and they could get a whole lot more creative than just paying someone to run 40 pick-and-rolls per game. They could build whatever sort of team they want, and if this season has been any indication, the kind of team they want isn't one dominated exclusively by Young.So once again, we're going to slightly sidestep the question of whether the Hawks are better without Trae Young, mostly because the far more pertinent question is if they're better off without Trae Young. That's what matters here. If Young returns and plays the brand of basketball we've come to expect from him, the answer is probably yes, they are in fact better off without him. He doesn't just have to prove that the Hawks can win slightly more games or post a slightly better net rating with him in the fold. If his return leads to only moderate improvement, well, that's not enough to justify the enormous extension he'll surely command. It won't be enough to prove that he's worth continuing to build around.\nFor him to do that, he's going to have to adapt. He's going to have to find ways of generating similar offensive impact that don't involve monopolizing the ball quite as much. He's going to have to make more of his 3s, ideally by taking easier ones, and he's going to have to find some way to at least minimize the damage his presence creates defensively. If he wants an extension worth $40-50 million per year, he's going to have to find a way to add $40-50 million worth of value to a team that's proven that even if it isn't necessarily better without him, it's more than good enough to weather his absence. Johnson, Daniels, Okongwu, Alexander-Walker have already proven they can be long-term cornerstones for the Hawks. Young is competing with a rookie who isn't yet on the team and veterans all across the league to prove that he deserves to be one as well.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At 15-11, with the NBA's sixth-best net rating, the Boston Celtics are way better than most of us thought they'd be. Instead of chasing lottery balls, they're fourth in the East, and they already have wins against the two teams above them in the standings. Last week, Jayson Tatum posted several videos of himself on the court on Instagram, and the Boston Globe reported that he has continued to tell people within the organization that he wants to play this season.If the Celtics are a good team right now, how good could they be with their franchise player? And if Tatum's return from a torn Achilles is realistic, should they be looking to make win-now moves between now and the Feb. 5 trade deadline?According to team president Brad Stevens, the team is open to the idea of improving the team to increase their short-term chances of competing for a title. \"There's nothing holding us back, necessarily, from that,\" he told reporters Wednesday, via CLNS. He added, though, that \"there's a lot of things that have to go right in a deal,\" and that the front office is still assessing this year's team.Boston is a half-game behind the third-place Toronto Raptors and 3½ games behind the second-place New York Knicks, but Stevens pointed out that \"hardly anything\" separates the Raptors (16-11) from the ninth-place Miami Heat (14-12). If the Celtics lose their next two games, which happen to be against Miami and Toronto, they could drop several spots.\n\"We're all still trying to figure out who we are and what we can be,\" Stevens said. \"We will not put a ceiling on this group. If it makes sense for us to look for things that can help us, we certainly will. But it all has to be within good deals and it all has to be within the ultimate goal, which is the North Star of retooling so we're in a position to compete for what we want to compete for.\"Stevens said that the Celtics \"always listen\" and are always looking at ways to improve the roster. He noted, though, that improvement can also come from \"people in the room getting better,\" pointing to center Neemias Queta and forward Jordan Walsh as examples of players who have made the most of their opportunities.Queta and Walsh have both been revelations as role players, and Jaylen Brown's scoring has been spectacular in a lead role. Even after the big \"retooling,\" though, Boston isn't in a position to throw money around to add reinforcements. Yes, the Celtics got under the second apron last summer, but they're still about $12.1 million above the luxury-tax line. To avoid the repeater tax, they may be motivated to shed salary -- specifically Anfernee Simons' $27.7 million expiring deal or a combination of Sam Hauser's contract (which pays $10 million this season) and smaller ones.\nSimons has averaged 23.7 minutes per game off the bench for Boston. He has played a much smaller role than the one he was used to with the Portland Trail Blazers, but Stevens praised his mindset, saying that that he's \"really trying\" and has \"made great strides\" defensively. It is unclear what value he has on the trade market.As for Tatum, Stevens confirmed what the Boston Globe reported last week: He wants to come back, but must clear several hurdles before he and the team can make a decision about that.\"There's a strength threshold he has to meet, and then, after that, several weeks of progressions,\" Stevens said.\nTatum has \"obviously made great strides,\" Stevens said, but is still focused on gaining strength. Eventually, he'll be able to ramp up his on-court workouts: \"scripted against small groups, scripted against bigger groups, scripted in five-on-five, unscripted, random, all the way up through those. But it's a long progression.\" As he works his way up, he will also be \"reconditioning to play real minutes, whatever that looks like.\"The Celtics are \"not putting a timeline on it, as we haven't the whole time,\" Stevens said. \"I mean, I think that one of the things that everybody can see is we didn't apply for a [disabled player exception] this year, which was a conscious decision for a lot of reasons. But the reality is he's not going to be back until he's 110% healthy and he feels good about it. And that's a big part of it. Obviously he's itching to play. Obviously he hates watching. But he's also -- I don't want to speak for him, but [he's] very cognizant of the need to meet any threshold and why there are those things that are put in place. But we've had a lot of great talks about it.\"If Boston had been terrible this season, then its situation would be simpler in some ways. There would be no talk about making upgrades at the deadline, and there would be far less talk about Tatum's potential return, too. Given how well the team has played, Stevens' front office has plenty to feel good about, but it's also facing a real challenge: building another title contender without the promise of a great pick in the 2026 draft. When he says that the Celtics will look for upgrades \"if it makes sense\" and if it aligns with their \"North Star,\" it means they're not going to overreact to the first third of this season. Sure, they could do something before the deadline that makes them better in the short term. But only if it also sets them up to compete for another championship down the road.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Vanderbilt was picked 11th in the SEC preseason poll, a sign that expectations for the Commodores centered on competing for an at-large NCAA Tournament bid for a second straight year rather than contending for a league title.It's time to adjust those expectations.Vanderbilt won 77-70 in overtime at Memphis on Wednesday to improve to 11-0. No, it wasn't the Commodores' sharpest performance -- they needed OT to get past a Memphis team that is now 4-6 with a Quadrant 4 loss to UNLV -- but it was still another win. And that's the point. Vanderbilt is now one of just seven undefeated teams in the country heading into Saturday's road game at Wake Forest, its final contest before Christmas.\"This wasn't pretty,\" Vanderbilt coach Mark Byington said. \"But to have the resiliency and toughness to come back on the road in this environment, I was impressed with the team.\"If there's a way to nitpick Vanderbilt's résumé, it's this: Unlike fellow SEC programs Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas and Auburn, the Commodores do not yet have a win over a currently ranked team or a top-30 opponent in the KenPom ratings. They also haven't had the opportunity.\nWhat they do have are convincing wins. Vanderbilt beat Saint Mary's by 25 points, SMU by 19 and VCU by 15. Those teams currently rank 33rd, 42nd and 43rd at KenPom, respectively. As a result, Vanderbilt sits as the highest-rated SEC team in KenPom and is projected to finish tied atop the league standings with reigning national champion Florida.It's a compelling story unfolding in Nashville.Vanderbilt sits at No. 15 in Thursday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings, where Michigan remains No. 1 for the ninth straight day.

    "body": "\n        Matthew Stafford is three games away from locking up an induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His enshrinement may not come until something like 2033, but what he does on Thursday in Seattle, and in the Rams' final two games against the Falcons and Cardinals, will carry a lot of weight. That's because Stafford is chasing his first NFL MVP award, the only missing piece of his Hall of Fame resume. He's currently the MVP favorite (-300) at DraftKings, followed by Drake Maye (+425) and Josh Allen (+550). It's definitely Stafford's award to lose. Maye is authoring one of the best year-two seasons by a quarterback ever, but his inability to hold onto a 21-point lead at home against Josh Allen and the Bills probably cost him the award. Allen is putting together another MVP-caliber season, but he might not win his division and November losses in Miami and Houston were costly.Stafford has a bulletproof case right now. He leads the NFL in advanced stats like EPA per play (0.24) and success rate (54.0%). He also leads the league in touchdown passes (37), TD-INT ratio (7.4), passer rating (112.2), touchdown rate (7.9%) and interception rate (1.1%). \nMatthew Stafford ranks this season (minimum 10 starts)EPA per play0.241stSuccess rate54.0%1stPass TD371stTD-INT ratio7.41stPasser rating112.21stTD pct7.9%1stINT pct1.1%1stPass yards3,7222ndAnother thing that will tug at voters' heartstrings… the Rams are poised to be the NFC's top seed. If you have the best season on the best team, chances are you are going to win MVP. Eight quarterbacks have thrown 40 touchdown passes in a season for a team that earned the top seed in the conference. All eight won the NFL MVP that season.Stafford is three away from 40 and the Rams control their own destiny in the NFC. The final hurdle is beating the Seahawks in Seattle on Thursday. That won't be an easy task by any means, especially without Davante Adams, so Stafford has his work cut out for him. If he can win that game and beat the Falcons and Cardinals, then I can't see a way he doesn't win MVP. 40 TD passes in a season with top playoff seed in conferenceWon MVP?2022 Patrick MahomesYes2020 Aaron RodgersYes2018 Patrick MahomesYes2013 Peyton ManningYes2011 Aaron RodgersYes2007 Tom BradyYes1999 Kurt WarnerYes1984 Dan MarinoYesOnly missing piece of Hall of Fame resumeSo why does an NFL MVP award make Stafford a lock for the Pro Football Hall of Fame? History shows that getting a gold jacket is about a quarterback's trophy case. Stafford already won a Super Bowl in the 2021 season with the Rams, so an MVP would make him the 15th quarterback in NFL history with an MVP award and a Super Bowl title.Ten of the 14 are already in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Three of the other four are locks (Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes) and the only one that isn't is Joe Theismann, whose gruesome leg injury in 1985 ended his career. Theismann was also nowhere near where Stafford is on the NFL all-time passing leaderboards, either. He was 30th in touchdown passes when he retired. Stafford is in the top 10 in passing yards and touchdowns.Quarterbacks with NFL MVP and Super Bowl titleIn Pro Football Hall of Fame?Joe MontanaYesTerry BradshawYesBart StarrYesJohn ElwayYesPeyton ManningYes  Johnny UnitasYes  Ken Stabler Yes  Steve YoungYes  Brett FavreYes  Kurt WarnerYes  Tom BradyNot eligible yetAaron RodgersNot eligible yet  Patrick MahomesNot eligible yet  Joe TheismannNoThe stock on Stafford's Hall of Fame case has been rising ever since he won the Super Bowl four years ago and now he's in a position to put himself over the top with last year's finish and this year's MVP campaign. In the next few years, there's going to be a few really interesting Hall of Fame cases among quarterbacks who put up monster numbers in the 2000s. How they will be judged is difficult to say. Many of them show up on the top 10 of all-time passing leaderboards, but you can chalk that up to the NFL's transition to a passing league in the 2000s. The trophy case is what will stand out. Stafford would be the only player in this group with both an MVP and a Super Bowl ring. Detractors can point out that Philip Rivers never made a Super Bowl, or that Eli Manning was never consistently one of the best quarterbacks in the league. Russell Wilson's career went off a cliff in the past five years, and Matt Ryan was ever so close to being in the company Stafford is in. Fair or not, I can see those things being held against them. I didn't include Ben Roethlisberger here because he should be a lock. He has two rings like Eli Manning, but was better than Manning in all counting and efficiency stats by a decent margin. Notable 2000s quarterbacks on the Hall of Fame bubbleMVPTitlesPass TDPass YardsMatthew Stafford0141463,531Philip Rivers0042263,560Eli Manning0236657,023Russell Wilson0135346,966Matt Ryan1038162,792Cam Newton1019432,382Second act for the agesI'm not sure what the Hall of Fame case would be against Stafford if he wins this MVP award. He's proved in five seasons with the Rams what he could have done in a decade plus with Detroit if he didn't have one of the worst supporting casts in the league (minus Calvin Johnson). He obviously never won a playoff game with the Lions and wasn't usually among the league's best quarterbacks on the stat sheet, but we can almost take that with a grain of salt now.His second act with the Rams has a chance to be that good. Check out these accolades he's chasingStafford can be the first quarterback all-time to win his first MVP award and first Super Bowl title, both at age 34 or older. Stafford can be the fourth quarterback to win an NFL MVP and Super Bowl after changing teams (Peyton Manning, Brett Favre and Steve Young) Stafford can be the oldest quarterback to win his first NFL MVP (37)Stafford can be the oldest quarterback to lead the NFL in Pass TD for the first time (37)Stafford can become the third player with three seasons with 40+ touchdown passes (Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers)It's crazy to think that five years ago, Stafford was thought of as a compiler with a rocket arm that had never won a playoff game. Now, with all that talent and the right pieces around him, he's on the cusp of a trophy case that is very Hall of Fame worthy. Plus, who knows what else he can add to his trophy case? The Rams are currently Super Bowl favorites, have the best all-around team in the NFL, and won't have to face Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs. A win on Thursday could go a long way toward the Rams getting a one seed, which would bring Stafford a step closer to an MVP, maybe even another ring, and ultimately, football immortality in Canton, Ohio. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Beyond the wins and losses, there is a narrative at stake here that's more than just wins and losses. A loss in the College Football Playoff opener can steer conventional wisdom -- right or wrong -- about a team, or in this year's case, whether half the sport even belongs in the format at all. Eight teams are will kick off the CFP festivities in this year's format that gives us straight seeding, opposed to last year where four of the five highest-ranked conference champions earned the first-round byes. So, going matchup by matchup, what would a loss mean for each team that plays in the first round? Let's have a look at the potential consequences ...(9) Alabama at (8) Oklahoma Alabama: The Kalen DeBoer \"will he or won't he\" will only get turned up to 11 if Alabama is unable to come away with the victory for a second time this season against Oklahoma. When you stack it up, losses to Oklahoma would be the bookends to a wretched final third of the season for Bama. After four wins in a row against Georgia, Vanderbilt, Missouri (with Beau Pribula) and Tennessee, no team was hotter than the Crimson Tide in October. It looked like they had moved past their embarrassment against Florida State. Then, they lost to OU in Tuscaloosa in a turnover-fueled showcase. Then, they nearly lost to Auburn after going up 17-0. Then, got drubbed by Georgia in the SEC title game. Now, if they fall to the Sooners for a second time this fall? It will begin a loud offseason of is he the right man for the job for DeBoer, which is a drumbeat that feels like it barely every really faded since he showed up in the wake of Nick Saban's dynastic run. That is, of course, if he is telling the truth when saying he plans on being Alabama's coach next season amid the Michigan rumors. \nOklahoma: You do have to give Brent Venables credit for stepping back and allowing Jim Nagy to come in to revamp the front office, and bringing in Ben Arbuckle and John Mateer to reshape the offense. Both moves look like masterstrokes powering the big turnaround in Norman in addition to Venables getting more hands-on with one of the nation's best defenses. But if they drop this game to Bama, there will need to be serious questions about whether OU can actually create a sustainable offensive system moving forward. The defense and the special teams have been opportunistic and contributed points, but the offense hasn't scored more than 3 touchdowns in a game against a power conference opponent all season. (10) Miami at (7) Texas A&MMiami: You will certainly hear from Notre Dame fans if either Alabama or Miami lose in the first round. Despite the fact that it is a fallacy to judge whether a team belongs in a tournament based on what they do in the tournament, that won't stop Irish fans from feeling like they got screwed by the Alabama playoff committee industrial complex or the fact that, on recent form, they certainly have looked better than Miami since September. If it's a close loss with a game management mistake, we'll also get a little dash of Mario Cristobal criticism, which you can never discount when Miami is in a big spot. Texas A&M: This team enjoyed one of the best seasons in program history since color television was invented; still, what if the Aggies could not do any of the following three things: \nBeat Texas Win their conference title Win a playoff game That will be a damning indictment of Aggies falling short of expectations, as usual. Everything Mike Elko has built this A&M team into from a culture perspective seems like it's made to avoid the common potholes this team has fallen into in the decades-long quest for staying power among the sport's elites. But stack those failures up, and the proof will be in the pudding. (11) Tulane at (6) Ole MissTulane: What if it's too much for Jon Sumrall, in the end, to balance two jobs? That's not shade but more a reality of the situation, especially if Tulane gets embarrassed. In theory, Tulane has the much better chance in comparison to James Madison of springing a major upset in the first round. These two teams have met before, which allows for a base with which to build a game plan upon and tweak specifically what didn't work in the teams' initial matchups. Yes, the Ole Miss staff will be different, and the game will be managed and called differently without Lane Kiffin there, but there's a path to shocking the college football world that's much clearer to see in Oxford. If they can't, the Green Wave will join last year's Boise State as a nice story that couldn't get it done when the lights were brightest.Ole Miss: There are ready-made excuses for Ole Miss if it drops this game to Tulane. Yes, it will be embarrassing if the Rebels lose to a team they beat soundly in Week 1, but the obvious 1,000-pound gorilla in the room is the coach who left and the assistants he's taking with him. Perhaps, in the end, they couldn't balance prep work for LSU with finishing the task in Oxford. Perhaps key players also had their heads turned by potential future prospects in Baton Rouge with their former coach or elsewhere. It will be an unfair referendum on Pete Golding's ability as a head coach in a one-game sample size, but you never get a second chance to make a first impression.\n(5) James Madison at (5) Oregon James Madison: For JMU, a loss -- especially a laughable blowout -- would justify the concerns bad-faith actors have surrounding Group of Five teams in the College Football Playoff. The truth of the matter is that if Virginia had won the ACC championship or if the ACC's tie-breaking scenarios were structured differently (think using CFP ranking as the American does), a hypothetical Virginia-Miami ACC title game would have guaranteed JMU was on the outside looking in. The ACC's loss from an automatic qualifier standpoint is James Madison's gain, and here it sits theoretically four games from the greatest Cinderella story in the history of the sport. Some are very openly musing about whether G5 teams belong in the tournament at all (they do, and the threat of an antitrust lawsuit from the G5 leagues is a big arrow in their quiver if a future format tries to exclude them). The problem is the Dukes are 21-point underdogs and Oregon is 6-2 against the spread as a double-digit favorite. Under Dan Lanning, the Ducks have a menacing air about them as they take care of business. This game shouldn't be close, and for JMU it's not just about the fact that it most likely will lose, it's by how much. It is not fair for this to become a referendum on the G5, but easy narratives are often the most common. Oregon: Maybe these Ducks were a year too early after all? The team that looked like a buzzsaw for so much of the season botching a first-round game that could not be more teed up for them would be a face plant the likes of which we have not seen in quite a while and points to the fact that maybe there is more parity than people realize. This would be Boise State vs. Oklahoma, except it would actually matter for the national championship and not just confined to an epic Fiesta Bowl. This would be at Autzen after weeks to meticulously game plan and get healthy (noteworthy for a beaten up Ducks team). This would be another in a string of weird ways Dan Lanning has fallen short, but this isn't against national championship game-bound Washington or Ohio State. There will be no excuse for Oregon if it loses this game. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The months of debating and bickering are over. The College Football Playoff begins this weekend with actual postseason games that will produce definitive results we no longer need to argue about. It's no longer \"win and hope the loss looks impressive enough.\" It's win or go home.Whether your feelings were hurt about your team, or any team, being left out or included doesn't matter anymore. Nor does the possible existential crisis caused by being forced to watch not one, but two Group of Five teams play in playoff games.And the one thing that really doesn't matter now? How poorly you may or may not have performed in your weekly picks column this season.What do you mean that's oddly specific? I'm simply pointing out that if you had the worst record of your life in a weekly picks column you've been publishing for 15 years, it no longer matters. We wipe the slate clean in the playoffs. It doesn't matter if you went 13-0, 10-3 or something far worse.\nWhat matters now is that you're here and you have a chance to be a champion.No. 9 Alabama at No. 8 Oklahoma (Friday)\nOne of two rematches in the first round, both of which felt like blowouts the first time around. The difference is that, in this one, the team that felt like it was being blown out won. Alabama outgained Oklahoma (in Tuscaloosa) 406 yards to 212. At no point during the game did the Oklahoma offense do anything that made you feel confident in its ability to move the ball consistently against the Tide.It was turnovers that did Alabama in. One was an 81-yard pick-six from Eli Bowen. The rest of Oklahoma's 16 points came via three field goals and a touchdown. None of Oklahoma's four scoring drives covered more than 41 total yards, as they were working with short fields resulting from either an Alabama turnover or special teams returns. It's not a formula a team can be counted on to repeat, which is why, even with this game at Oklahoma, Alabama is favored.Still, I'm not convinced the Tide should be. We saw last year how road teams struggled in these first-round games, and while there was no game last year as evenly-matched as this one, the fact that it's so evenly-matched only pushes me further toward Oklahoma and its homefield advantage. Oklahoma's offense has been bad all season. I've made no secret about my feelings for it, but what isn't talked about is that Alabama's offense has been just as bad as Oklahoma's lately. Seriously, in Alabama's last five games against FBS opponents, it has averaged 1.70 points per possession. Oklahoma has averaged 1.64 in the same time frame.\nPushing me further in Oklahoma's direction is the health of both teams. Oklahoma's defense will get R. Mason Thomas back this week, and he's their best pass-rusher. Alabama will once again be without LT Overton on its defensive line, and there are whispers that Ty Simpson has been dealing with an injury of his own for weeks. While I can't verify those whispers, his performance over the last month or so is not helping Simpson shake the allegations. It's hard to beat the same team twice in the same season, but Oklahoma probably shouldn't have won the first time! So give me Oklahoma in the rematch, too. The Pick: Oklahoma +1.5 (-112) at DraftkingsNo. 10 Miami at No. 7 Texas A&M\nMiami's sudden inclusion in the playoff field caused plenty of controversy, but it also gives us one of the more intriguing first-round matchups. These teams are similar in a lot of ways, which makes this game fascinating. Both are strong along the lines of scrimmage, yet there are legitimate questions about how each will look against an opponent capable of matching that physicality. Neither has faced many teams like this all season.We've also seen the Texas A&M defense struggle against quality offenses. Yes, it beat Notre Dame on the road earlier this season, but it also allowed 40 points in that game, 42 to Arkansas, 30 to South Carolina and even 24 and 22 to UTSA and Utah State to open the year. Miami's defense has been more consistent, but it has not faced many offenses with receivers like KC Concepcion and Mario Craver.\nIt's also worth noting what happened in Miami's two losses. Louisville's Chris Bell went off for 136 yards and two touchdowns, and SMU's Jordan Hudson -- no, not that one -- also posted 136 receiving yards against the Canes.My suspicion is that both secondaries have benefited from playing behind strong pass rushes and could struggle when that pressure is neutralized. I believe both Miami's and Texas A&M's offensive lines are capable of slowing the opposing pass rush to a degree few teams have managed this season. Both offenses are balanced and talented enough at the skill positions to take advantage of that extra time.I don't expect a 45-42 shootout, but I do think this game produces more points than the total suggests. The Pick: Over 48.5 (-114) at Fanduel\nNo. 11 Tulane at No. 6 Ole MissIf you go back to the first meeting, which Ole Miss won 45-10, there's a valid argument to be made that Tulane got game-scripted out of it quickly. Jake Retzlaff, who joined Tulane late in the offseason and wasn't fully familiar with his new team yet, started 0-for-9, and it was quickly 13-0 Ole Miss, which forced Tulane to play a style of football that doesn't suit it.It all makes plenty of sense, and I can envision a scenario where the Tulane offense performs much better here. What I'm having a much tougher time seeing is how Tulane stops Ole Miss from putting up points. The Rebels finished with 548 yards and averaged 7.9 per play in the game. They stopped themselves a couple of times in the red zone and had to settle for two field goals, leaving points on the board. If Ole Miss finishes those two drives, it's a 52-10 win rather than 45-10.I know there are question marks surrounding the Rebels' offense here because of the whole Lane Kiffin saga. I have no idea how that will impact things in the game. Charlie Weis Jr, the team's offensive coordinator, is with the team for the playoff run, but we don't know how much influence Kiffin had with playcalling during games. It's not crazy to think his absence could lead to a few more mistakes made by the Rebels' offense, or maybe new coach Pete Golding, the defensive coordinator, is more conservative with fourth-down decisions than Kiffin was. My guess is that, considering the emotional circumstances at play and that this is a home game in Oxford, which could allow Ole Miss fans, players, and coaches who have been frustrated by the whole situation to let it all out, we'll see the same aggressive approach as always. The Pick: Ole Miss Team Total Over 37.5 (-108) at Fanduel\nNo. 12 James Madison at No. 5 Oregon\nI feel bad for James Madison. All it did was go out there and win every game it could and win its conference. Then it was chosen to compete in the CFP, and the world lost its mind about it. You've got college football literati out here reacting to the Dukes being in the playoff field as they carry some highly spreadable incurable disease that will not only destroy college football, but possibly human civilization.To be blunt, I do not believe James Madison can win the national title, but if the ability to actually win the CFP was part of the criteria for selection, I'd argue that means we need to eliminate at least half the field. Frankly, unlike seven of the teams in the field, at least the Dukes qualified for it by winning their conference instead of being chosen by a group full of people nobody seems to trust. The way I view it, James Madison either loses as we all expect it to, or it pulls off a stunning upset that we remember forever, and isn't that what sports are ultimately about as a fan? It's a memory-making business.But I digress.I do expect James Madison to lose, but if the Dukes keep it close, they'll do so because of their run game and because their defense does enough to limit Oregon's explosive plays. If Oregon blows the Dukes out, considering how banged up it's been down the stretch, I would expect Dan Lanning and company to take a cautious \"let's just get out of here and get ready for next week\" approach to the second half. Both of those scenarios strike me as lower-scoring affairs. The Pick: Under 47.5 (-110) at Fanduel\n            ",

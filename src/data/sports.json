    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks are a franchise in turmoil after firing general manager Nico Harrison as the team failed to live up to his vision following the disastrous trade sending Luka Dončić to the Lakers. With Harrison gone, the Mavs desperately need to create a new vision for the team that they can sell to fans, and the obvious way to do so is to shift the focus to the future and build around No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg. To do so, they will need to unload high-priced veterans, most notably the centerpiece of the return for Dončić, Anthony Davis. Ever since Harrison got fired, the expectation has been that Davis' days in Dallas are numbered, and on Wednesday we got our first strongly reported confirmation of that from ESPN's Tim MacMahon. MacMahon cites multiple team sources who said the team will \"explore the trade market\" for Davis ahead of the February deadline. One challenge in moving Davis is there is no chance they get back anything close to what they gave up to bring him to Dallas, but at this point it seems like they are treating the Dončić trade as being a sunk cost. That can't be the bar a Davis trade is held to, and if they go in with a realistic expectation, then a deal could get done.\n\n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis trade rumors: Ranking every NBA team as a possible landing spot for Mavericks' star big man\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEven being more realistic, the Mavs will need Davis to eventually return to the floor and play like the All-Star caliber center he long has been. His latest calf strain has forced him to be held out for multiple weeks and given his injury history, teams acquiring the 32-year-old will have their concerns about giving up a haul to bring him in given the injury risk. As for which teams could be interested in Davis, if the Warriors are serious about going all-in on trying to win another title with Stephen Curry, they have a glaring need for frontcourt reinforcements to aid Curry and Jimmy Butler. Davis would give them another high-end veteran to chase another title, and Dallas could finally be a landing spot for Jonathan Kuminga, giving him a fresh start on a team with a more future-facing timeline alongside Flagg. If Davis is on the market, it's fair to wonder if we'll be headed down a mini-fire sale route in Dallas come February. They could look to sell off a number of their veteran pieces, like PJ Washington, Daniel Gafford and Klay Thompson, not to mention Kyrie Irving who is hoping to return to the court at some point this season. It might be difficult maximizing return for Irving if he hasn't played before the deadline, but he could certainly be on the table this summer if they want to fully shift focus to a youth movement around Flagg. \nEverything is on the table now that Harrison is gone, but the first order of business in Dallas seems to be finding a way to undo as much of the Dončić trade as possible by trading Davis. \n            ",

UConn utilizes a balanced scoring attack, which was perfectly displayed on Saturday with Alex Karaban, Tarris Reed Jr. and Silas Demary Jr. each scoring 21 points. Reed leads the team at 20 ppg, with Karajan adding 18.3 ppg this year. The Huskies have an age and experience advantage with all five of their starters being either juniors or seniors. UConn is 62-6 since the beginning of the 2021-22 college basketball season at home, and the model projects that home-court advantage to play a key role on Wednesday, with the Huskies covering in 65% of simulations. Back UConn at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Cavaliers (+100) to defeat the Rockets  Cleveland had the second-best record in the NBA at 64-18 last season, and the Cavaliers are off to another strong start this year at 10-5, including winning two straight. The Cavaliers are 6-2 at home this season as they prepare to host the Rockets, who have a 9-3 record. Fueled by the addition of Kevin Durant, Houston figures to be in the championship conversation this season, but so does Cleveland. The Cavaliers are 7-2 over their last nine games, and Donovan Mitchell has scored at least 30 points in three straight games. Mitchell is averaging 30.9 ppg this season, and the model projects the Cavaliers to win in 61% of simulations, showcasing strong value for Wednesday night. Back Cleveland at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Miami (OH) (-1.5) vs. Buffalo (-108)Miami (OH) and Buffalo are both 4-2 in Mid-American Conference play this season, but they haven't gotten there in the same way. Buffalo is winless against teams currently with winning conference records, while the RedHawks have a signature conference victory as the only team to knock off Western Michigan in MAC play this year. Miami's two losses came to the defending MAC champion (Ohio) and the No. 1 scoring team in the conference (Toledo). Meanwhile, Buffalo lost at home to Akron and barely defeated a winless UMass team in a 28-21 final. Buffalo is home on Wednesday, but that may not be an advantage as the Bulls are 1-3 at UB Stadium against FBS opponents this year.

    "body": "\n        Will Stein's realization of his football mortality arrived quickly as a player. A non-typical 5-foot-10, 185-pound quarterback who was described in his Louisville bio as \"heady\" and a \"student of the game,\" Stein ascended to starter ahead of the Cardinals' 2011 campaign. He played well through two games but suffered a shoulder against Kentucky. He went to the sideline and out came a true freshman. It took a throw or two for Stein to know Teddy Bridgewater wasn't going to give the job back. \"I knew right when he went in the game,\" Stein says with a laugh. \"There's a reason he's a first-round pick.\" Stein once told Lake Travis (Texas) High School head coach Hank Carter, who he worked under as offensive coordinator for two seasons, \"Not only is (Teddy) a better guy than me, but he's a way better player. I'm just totally screwed.\" \nThat self-deprecating humor and generally positive outlook is why UTSA head coach Jeff Traylor bestowed a Remember the Titans-coded nickname on Stein. \"He's one of the brightest stars in college athletics,\" Traylor said. \"There's a reason he's called Will 'Sunshine' Stein.\" Stein may not be a first-round pick like Bridgewater. But he sure produces them as Oregon's offensive coordinator. \nAhead of a key matchup with No. 15 USC, the seventh-ranked Ducks rank third nationally in yards per play. Stein's quarterback, Dante Moore, is projected by scouts -- if he chose to leave -- to be Oregon's third straight Day 1 or Day 2 pick following Bo Nix and Dillon Gabriel.WATCH: No. 7 Oregon vs. No. 15 USC | 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday, CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (free), Paramount+ PremiumA 36-year-old Kentucky native who spent most of his coaching infancy in Texas, Stein is a coach on the rise. He's a name to know in one of the wildest coaching cycles in recent memory and the author of four top-20 offenses in four seasons as a play-caller between UTSA and Oregon. \n\"Dude tries to score,\" Traylor said. \"I know you're thinking, 'Everyone tries to score.' No. Will Stein tries to SCORE. He ain't scared.\" \n        \n            \n                College football odds, picks, predictions: USC vs. Oregon, Pitt vs. Georgia Tech deliver Week 13 playoff buzz\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA play-calling experiment in Austin  After a brief flirtation with law school or a career in real estate, Stein stayed with Louisville as a GA following his playing career. Then Charlie Strong got the Texas job. He and offensive coordinator Shawn Watson asked Stein to come with them as a quality control coach. Stein arrived around the same time as Traylor -- Texas' tight ends coach in 2015 and 2016 -- and they ended up living together in Traylor's uncle's house. Traylor was away from his family. Stein was a broke kid a few years out of college. They became so close Traylor considers him like a son. \nWhen Texas fired Strong, Tom Herman opted to keep Stein on staff. The Longhorns played in the 2017 Texas Bowl in Herman's debut. During bowl prep Tim Beck -- now the head coach at Coastal Carolina -- granted Stein's request to call plays for the scout team during their scrimmage portion of practice. \"I had an itch to call it,\" Stein said. After that season Stein had a decision about what was next. He'd been an off-field coach for five years. He wanted to take the next step. His girlfriend, now wife, Darby also loved Austin and didn't want to leave. So, Stein turned down a position job at Northern Iowa. Nothing really called him to leave the Longhorns.That is until Lake Travis had an offensive coordinator opening. For those unversed in Texas high school football lore, Lake Travis is a quarterback mecca. Everyone from Baker Mayfield to Garrett Gilbert and Todd Reesing have come through the annual state power located in the Austin suburbs. \nCarter interviewed at least 10 people for the job. He didn't love any of them. That's when he got a call from two friends: Former Texas High School Relations director Hardee McCrary and Traylor, who both recommend Stein. \"I sat down with him and not a minute in I was like, 'This is our guy. There's no doubt,'\" Carter said. Stein described his time as the offensive coordinator at Lake Travis as one of experimentation. High school coaches teach in Texas. Stein would sneak into his office while teaching PE to watch tape and script practice. The next year he was assigned the in-school suspension class (ISS), and he'd grind tape while the kids sat in silent punishment for the day. \nThose Lake Travis teams did not lack talent. His triggerman was eventual Texas and Purdue quarterback Hudson Card, who threw to NFL superstar receiver Garrett Wilson. But you don't pick your all your players in high school, and there were times Lake Travis was overmatched in 6A football and Stein found out how it felt to \"get our asses kicked.\" \"It taught me how to be creative with our players,\" Stein said. \"You've got what you got in high school football.\" Carter loved working with Stein. The pair are still good friends, and Carter will never forget how he lost him. Traylor called Carter, amid a playoff run, with some news: \"Brother, you're not going to believe it, but I'm about to get the UTSA job.\" \nCarter was thrilled. He'd known Traylor for years. Then Traylor hit him with the bad news. \"I'm taking Will,\" Traylor said. \"I was like, 'Eff you, you sorry motherf---er,\" Carter remembers with a huge laugh. \"It was great.\" Oregon quarterback Dante Moore could become the third Day 1 or Day 2 NFL draft pick developed by Ducks offensive coordinator Will Stein. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Stein the play caller Stein served as UTSA's pass game coordinator for two years before being elevated to offensive coordinator in 2022. Here's how his offenses have ranked in points per game over the last four years:\n2022 (UTSA): 14th 2023 (Oregon): 2nd 2024 (Oregon): 17th  2025 (Oregon): 7thScore Stein does. Now, here's his starting quarterback's completion percentage every year he's been a college play-caller: 2022 (Frank Harrs): 69.6%  2023 (Bo Nix): 77.4%  2024 (Dillon Gabriel): 72.9%  2025 (Dante Moore): 72.8%That's a career high for each of those passers. In Nix's case it's the single most accurate season in college football history. Gabriel and Moore, if his season ended today, would rank in the top 30 all time. Those are four different quarterbacks with different skill sets -- Stein would be quick to add \"high-level\" skill sets -- who all hit their accuracy zenith under Stein. Part of that is Stein's guiding philosophy as a coordinator: \"We play common sense football.\"  \nYou play Cover 2 with the safeties set deep, Stein is probably going to call a run or teach his quarterback to take the underneath throws that allow Oregon's playmakers to create yardage in space. If opponents press with a single-high safety, Stein is going to call a shot over the top.Stein completed 70% of his passes under his high school offensive coordinator Andrew Coverdale. Teddy Bridgewater led the ACC in completion percentage his final two years under Watson. Carter's Lake Travis offenses prioritize accuracy. It's a foundational element of Stein's football education and what he thinks contributes to winning football. \"He understands the (quarterback) position,\" Traylor said. \"He asks kids to do what they do naturally do well. He's not going to make his quarterbacks do what they don't like to do. His scheme is quarterback friendly.\" Oregon is a big-play offense. The Ducks have the second-most plays of 20-plus yards in the country this year. It's a product of the Ducks' overwhelming speed and explosiveness. Stein is proud of that production. What might explain Oregon's offensive production best, however, is the relentless down-to-down efficiency. Stein likes to think of play-calling as a batting average. The more first downs you get, the higher chance you have of winning the game. Nobody does that better than Oregon.The Ducks rank first in the Power Four in three-and-punt percentage (6.5%), first in drives without a first down (15.7%) and fifth nationally in offensive success rate.Stein said everyone views second-and-short as a shot down. He can't help but think: Why not just get another set of downs? \"It's the commonsense approach for me,\" Stein said. \"That's something we preach. Keep us in the green mentality and we have another set of four downs.\" \n        \n            \n                Meet the candidates -- 88 of them: The only list you need for college football's wildest coaching carousel\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA head coaching future? Oregon is amid another playoff push and Moore is on the cusp of emerging as the Ducks' next drafted signal caller. People notice that success, and often that will create opportunities for the coordinators on staff. And Stein is often thrown out as a head coaching candidate this cycle.Those who know him well view it as only a matter of time. \"As soon as Coach Traylor stole him from me and took him back to college, I knew he'd be a head coach before long,\" Carter said. Stein admits being a head coach is a goal of his just like he had the itch to call plays as a QC eight years ago. That doesn't mean he'll take the usual or obvious path. Stein didn't want to leave Austin, leading to a two-year high school detour that changed his career. Stein loves being in Eugene and is in no rush to leave, so he can be selective about future head coaching opportunities. \"Winning solves a lot, and when you win, there's enough for everybody,\" Stein said. \"When you lose, there's not enough for anybody. That's an old Jeff Traylor quote, and it's so true. \"My singular focus is this team and the next steps. If I'm fortunate enough to get there in my career, it will be great. But I'm in an unbelievable spot and have the best support in the country, and work for the best head coach in the country, getting to coach the best quarterbacks in the country, with the best line, receivers and running backs. And there's a lot that is good about that situation. It allows me to just be where my feet are, and the focus on this and the focus on this process and let the results take care of themselves.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The inherent absurdity of the College Football Playoff Selection Committee releasing rankings before the regular season ends is obvious. The results aren't final, so what does it matter where any team is ranked at that moment in time? There are so many more games to play.Also, why rank 25 teams when there are only 12 spots? Why do we need to know who the No. 21 team is? Just tell us the teams that are in and what seed they'd be.I tell ya, the whole process is idiotic! A much better idea would be to take the 12-team field as currently presented in the latest rankings and play it out in a magical world of whimsy! That's why I've taken this beautiful bracket pictured below and played it through in a series of super serious simulations. These simulations are powered by AI, folks, so you know they're legit. OK, so by AI, I mean my computer. I used my own weekly College Football Power Ratings and played out the hypothetical matchups. What follows are the results. Are they a prediction of the future? Or are they a statement of fact? Only time will tell.\nQuarterfinal sites below based on current College Football Playoff bowl projections.The projected College Football Playoff bracket entering the Week 13 action \n                                                                    CBS Sports Graphic\n                                                            College Football Playoff predictionsFirst roundNo. 12 Tulane at No. 5 Texas Tech: First of all, it's wild that Tulane is the highest-ranked Group of Five team this week despite having a 22-point loss to UTSA on its resume -- particularly when North Texas beat the same UTSA team by 38 ... a week after losing to South Florida by 27. Boy, teams in the American lose big when they lose, huh? Anyway, we're going to spend the next few weeks arguing over which G5 team deserves the spot, but they're going to get blown out by Texas Tech regardless. Texas Tech advances.No. 9 Notre Dame at No. 8 Oklahoma: This is a tough call. This game would be played in Norman, Oklahoma, which is a serious boost for the Sooners, but I have Notre Dame as nearly a touchdown better than Oklahoma in my power ratings on a neutral field. Can home field make up for that gap? It might, but in this simulation, Notre Dame is the first road team to win a first-round game in College Football Playoff history. A real \"where were you?\" moment. Notre Dame advances.\nNo. 11 Miami at No. 6 Ole Miss: This would be a close game on a neutral field, but this will be played at Vaught Hemingway Stadium, tilting the outcome strongly in the Rebels' favor. Don't feel too bad about it, though, Miami. In reality, you wouldn't even be here if this were the real playoff. You're the highest-ranked ACC team but also the least likely of the ranked ACC teams to win the ACC. Ole Miss advances.No. 10 Alabama at No. 7 Oregon: These are the Nos. 3 and 4 teams in my power ratings, and they're essentially equal. This game on paper is a virtual coin flip. But it won't be played on paper. It'll be played on turf -- turf that's inside Autzen Stadium, which is a madhouse when the Ducks are hosting Eastern Washington. Imagine what it'll be like when it's hosting a playoff game? Let this serve as a notice to Alabama that it needs to win the SEC, because it doesn't want to find itself in a road game like this one in the first round. Oregon advances.\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Miami's rise complicates Notre Dame's picture-perfect CFP case\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nQuarterfinalsNo. 4 Georgia vs. No. 5 Texas Tech (Cotton Bowl): We're at neutral sites now, which is ridiculous. It makes no sense that the teams that are good enough to earn a bye don't also get a home game to go with it, but it won't matter when they expand this bad boy to 16 teams eventually. As for this matchup, I can't wait to watch this hypothetical game along the lines of scrimmage, because Texas Tech may legitimately have a better defensive line than Georgia. Imagine somebody writing that sentence last year. Still, I think Georgia would come through with the win here. I give the Dawgs the edge at QB and the skill positions on offense. Georgia advances.\nNo. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 9 Notre Dame (Rose Bowl): A rematch of last year's title game with very similar results. The Irish are good, but I don't think they're strong enough in the front seven on defense to do what they'd have to do if they wanted to pull off an upset here. Plus, remember when Ohio State went into death machine mode for the playoff last year? The Buckeyes will probably do the same thing here. Ohio State advances.No. 3 Texas A&M vs. No. 6 Ole Miss (Sugar Bowl): I have Texas A&M ahead of Ole Miss in my power ratings, but the gap isn't nearly as wide as their rankings suggest. A&M is No. 8 in my ratings, just ahead of Ole Miss at No. 10. This game, on a neutral field, can go either direction. In my simulations, the edge went Ole Miss' way this time. However, after the game, Ole Miss told Lane Kiffin that he has to make a decision about his future by the end of next week, and they're super serious about it this time. Ole Miss advances.No. 2 Indiana vs. No. 7 Oregon (Orange Bowl): Last year, Oregon beat Ohio State at Autzen Stadium and earned a first-round bye in the playoff. They then had a rematch with that very same Ohio State team and lost, ending their season. This year, Indiana beat Oregon at Autzen Stadium and earned a first-round bye in the playoff. They then had a rematch with that very same Oregon team in this simulation, and guess what? They lost! Oregon advances.\nSemifinalsNo. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 4 Georgia (Fiesta Bowl or Peach Bowl): I bet I know which one of these two semifinals will be the one played in primetime. This is an incredible matchup we're getting, and it isn't the first time these behemoths have met in a playoff game. Nor will it be the last. Georgia won the last time, but in this simulation, the defending champions keep their bid to repeat alive. Ohio State advances.No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 7 Oregon (Fiesta Bowl or Peach Bowl): In the last round, Ole Miss wasn't as big an underdog to Texas A&M as their seeds might suggest. In this round, Ole Miss is still an underdog despite the seeds. Yeah, Oregon is No. 3 in my power ratings, seven spots ahead of the Rebels. That gap was too much for Lane Kiffin -- who is still ignoring that ultimatum -- and Ole Miss to overcome. Oregon advances.College Football Playoff National ChampionshipNo. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 7 Oregon (Hard Rock Stadium -- Miami): After playing twice last year and splitting the series, these teams avoided each other in the regular season this year. They didn't even meet in the Big Ten Championship Game. Instead, they both meet in the title game, ensuring that the Big Ten will win its third consecutive national championship. It's also Ohio State's second straight, as the Buckeyes prove to be too much for the Ducks. \nOhio State is your back-to-back national champion. Which, if it does happen, is the most impressive feat in college football history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Orioles and Los Angeles Angels kicked off Major League Baseball's trading season late Tuesday night with a surprising swap involving right-handed starter Grayson Rodriguez and outfielder Taylor Ward.As is tradition here at CBS Sports whenever an interesting deal happens, I'm here to provide near-instant analysis on everyone involved. That includes, among other responsibilities, handing out grades to each team. You'll find all of that information below, though mind you that the grades themselves are the least important part of the piece.Before we get to the analysis, here's the trade in its entirety:Orioles receive: OF Taylor WardAngels receive: RHP Grayson RodriguezNow, let's conduct some business. Orioles grade: BMike Elias may be the most hyperrational executive in MLB history when it comes to pitchers. Everyone knows about their attrition rates and volatility, but Elias actually takes the risk profile to heart. It wouldn't be too surprising if he had a \"TINSTAAPP\" tattoo on one of his elbows. To wit, he's guided the Orioles since the fall of 2018 -- more than seven whole years -- without ever 1) signing a pitcher to a guaranteed multi-year pact or 2) selecting a pitcher with a first-round pick.Yes, Elias has traded for a few pitchers in his time, Corbin Burnes and Zach Eflin included, but he's otherwise avoided investing more in arms than he absolutely has to -- for better and for worse. Here, Elias is bailing on Rodriguez, someone who was viewed as one of the most promising young starters not long ago, in exchange for a rental outfielder with a career 111 OPS+. It's a fascinating little trade.\nWard, 32 in a matter of weeks, is coming off a 36-homer showing that saw him post just a 116 OPS+. (Remarkably, teammate Jo Adell homered 37 times for a 111 OPS+.) He's been at least a league-average hitter in five consecutive seasons and he has the 15th best OPS in the majors against lefties since 2023 (putting him in the midst of a group that includes Mookie Betts and Shohei Ohtani). He's not a good outfield defender, but he's regularly turned in 2- or 3-win seasons and he ought to do it again. In time, I think that description may prove to undersell Ward. He's far more interesting now than he was 12 months ago. While he doesn't post extreme exit velocities, he upped his slugging by moving closer to the plate and making contact further out in front. Despite those changes, he maintained an excellent grasp over the strike zone and connected more frequently on pitches within the zone. Considering upside with a player of this age and track record is normally foolish. Still, the overall profile here isn't too different from Seiya Suzuki, with the difference being Ward has one season with a 130 OPS+ or better while Suzuki has three and counting.Ward figures to slot into a corner-outfield spot, with Baltimore using some combination of Colton Cowser, Dylan Beavers, Tyler O'Neill, and Leody Taveras to fill out the depth chart.\nI'm less interested in what Elias does with the outfield than what he does now with his rotation. The Orioles are an obvious candidate to nab a free-agent starter or two, but at what cost? Will Elias go against his hard-earned reputation and give Framber Valdez, Dylan Cease, or Ranger Suárez multiple years? Or will he pursue a different solution, one that allows him to avoid a commitment through some potentially lean years? This is an important offseason for the Orioles, looking to rebound after a lost year. If the Ward trade is any indication, Elias is going to be bold.Angels grade: B This trade has the potential to be a big winner for the Angels. Rodriguez has three additional years of team control, giving him a longer tail over which to produce, and he's not that far removed from being considered one of the best young arms in the sport. Even if he just sustains his career production to date (a 97 ERA+ in 43 starts), the Angels will no doubt come out ahead in the eventual accounting. \nAlas, trade analysis isn't -- or shouldn't be, anyway -- so simple as adding up the WAR. With Rodrigez, I think it's worth asking: do the Orioles make this trade if they think Rodriguez has a butterfly's chance in a blizzard of reliably taking his turn in the rotation? Probably not.\nNot-so-coincidentally, Rodriguez missed last season following Tommy John surgery. Predicting player health, and especially pitcher health, is a fool's errand. Even so, it's apparent that Rodriguez has some serious durability concerns. He's thrown more than 100 innings in a season just three times since being drafted in 2018, and he's never cleared 25 starts or 130 innings. Will he ever? Your guess is as good as mine and anyone else's. The Orioles seem to be betting on \"no.\"Extreme volatility is often viewed as an analyst's worst enemy -- we like to center our projections on the most likely outcome. That's not always the case. There's a pathway here where the Orioles are correct in their assessment of Rodriguez's availability while the Angels still come out ahead. The majors are scattered with injury-prone pitchers who have enjoyed a big season or two, be it Michael King, Garrett Crochet, whomever. That may not be the likeliest potential outcome, but it is a potential outcome nonetheless, and if it comes to fruition the Angels could really stand to benefit, not only from what he provides them on the field but what he may return as part of an in-season trade.\nShould Rodriguez prove he can stay healthy, he has the talent to produce as a plus starter, albeit on a rate basis. The last time he was on a big-league mound, he showed off a four-pitch mix that included a 96 mph fastball and three other offerings that stuff models consider to be above-average pitches. I will note that Rodriguez has found himself vulnerable to hard contact, with opponents battering his fastball to the tune of an .841 OPS. Maybe there's a deficiency there not being captured by those pitch-quality measures, or maybe it's something he can work through with new pitching coach Mike Maddux. The unspoken part here is that you can be high on Ward and acknowledge he's a 33-year-old with a season of team control left. Can you bank on him declining the qualifying offer tender next winter and recouping draft-pick compensation? I think not. Realistically, I don't think the Angels were going to nab a player in return for Ward who offers both immediate and long-term potential impact like Rodriguez, either. This was probably the best deal that was going to be available to them.If you're Perry Minasian and the Angels, you have to take the plunge, warts and all -- the upside is just that tantalizing. \n            ",

Buffalo is also coming off a loss, falling to Central Michigan, 38-19, last week. The Bulls' 4-2 conference record may be a little misleading, as none of those four wins came against teams with winning conference records this season. Buffalo also has a 7-point victory against UMass for one of just two one-possession games the Minutemen have played in during their 0-10 season. Buffalo is 1-3 against FBS opponents at home this season, with its only win coming in a 31-30 overtime victory over Eastern Michigan when the Bulls were favored by 9.5 points.

Stroud. But this game will be about Josh Allen against the Texans top-ranked defense.  Allen is coming off a six-touchdown day against the Bucs and on a short week this defense will present a big challenge. But I think he's now ready to get on a roll. Bills win it. Pick: Bills 24, Texans 17 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookPittsburgh Steelers at Chicago Bears (-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis might be a Steelers team without Aaron Rodgers (wrist), which means it could be Mason Rudolph time. He is a capable backup, but this will put a lot of pressure on the Steelers run game. If it's Rodgers, how limited will he be? The Bears have played a lot of close games, winning most of them, and this will be no different. The Bears will squeak another one out late. Pick: Bears 23, Steelers 21 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookNew England Patriots (-7.5) at Cincinnati BengalsSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Patriots are riding high, while the Bengals are going in the opposite direction. The Bengals will be without suspended receiver Ja'Marr Chase in this one, which will challenge them even more. The Patriots will be rested having played last Thursday, which is is an advantage. They will keep it rolling behind Drake Maye as they win a shootout. Pick: Patriots 35, Bengals 30 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNew York Giants at Detroit Lions (-10.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Lions are coming off a tough loss to the Eagles and now must regroup at home against a Giants team that isn't going anywhere. The Giants might have Jaxson Dart back at quarterback this week, but it won't matter who plays quarterback. This will be about the Lions offense getting back on track after disappointing last week. They roll. Pick: Lions 31, Giants 10 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20XMinnesota Vikings at Green Bay Packers (-6.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Vikings are getting little from quarterback J.J. McCarthy and as a result this is a must-win game for them. The Packers still haven't quite clicked yet on offense either and now must play without Josh Jacobs (knee). That's not good, but it will force them to open it up, which is a good thing. Jordan Love will play well and win it with that more-open style. Pick: Packers 27, Vikings 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookSeattle Seahawks (-13) at Tennessee Titans Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Seahawks are playing consecutive road games after losing to the Rams last week in Los Angeles. Sam Darnold threw four picks in that game, but the defense played well to keep it close. The Titans don't do anything on offense, so look for the Seattle defense to dominate here. Seahawks get back on track. Pick: Seahawks 24, Titans 7 | Odds via BetMGMIndianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is the game of the week, featuring a Colts team coming off a bye against a Chiefs team that can't afford another loss. The Colts have rolled on offense this season, but this is a spot where the Kansas City defense steps up and plays well. The Chiefs win it with a desperate season-saving showing as Patrick Mahomes bounces back. Pick: Chiefs 26, Colts 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNew York Jets at Baltimore Ravens (-13.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jets are making a change at quarterback with Tyrod Taylor in as the starter. Does it really matter? The Ravens had won three straight to right things as they push the Steelers in the division. The offense still hasn't played great, but I think this is the game for Lamar Jackson to get back to looking like himself after his hamstring injury a few weeks back. Ravens win it. Pick: Ravens 30, Jets 13 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookCleveland Browns at Las Vegas Raiders (-3)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis will be Shedeur Sanders making his first start for the Browns. The good news is he's facing a Raiders team that struggles against the pass. The Raiders offense has issues protecting Geno Smith as well, which could be setting up a big day for Myles Garrett. The Browns will win a low-scoring game. Pick: Browns 20, Raiders 17 | Odds via BetMGMJacksonville Jaguars (-2.5) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a long trip for a team coming off a big victory like the Jaguars did last week against the Chargers. Focus could be an issue with a young team, but I still think they found something on offense last week. That will carry over here. They get the best of an Arizona team that is struggling. Jaguars win it. Pick: Jaguars 28, Cardinals 23 | Odds via BetMGMPhiladelphia Eagles (-4.5) at Dallas CowboysSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Cowboys will pose a real challenge for the Eagles defense with the way Dak Prescott can light up the scoreboard. Philadelphia hasn't been great on offense, so the question is whether they can get it going. Not having Lane Johnson will hurt. Look for a lot of points here as the Cowboys pull off an upset. Pick: Cowboys 33, Eagles 31 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookAtlanta Falcons at New Orleans Saints (-1.5)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Saints are coming off a bye and they face a Falcons team without quarterback Michael Penix. That means it's Kirk Cousins for the Falcons. He didn't do a lot in relief last week. The Saints won the last time out behind their defense and some timely throws from Tyler Shough. I think that same formula will win here. Pick: Saints 24, Falcons 20 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookTampa Bay Buccaneers at Los Angeles Rams (-6.5)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Bucs are playing consecutive road games after losing at Buffalo to the Bills, and now must travel across the country to play one of the league's best. That will be a challenge. The Rams defense picked off Sam Darnold four times last week, so they are playing well. Baker Mayfield will keep his team in this one, but the Rams will win it late. Pick: Rams 28, Bucs 26 | Odds via BetMGMCarolina Panthers at San Francisco 49ers (-6.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a long road trip for a Monday night game against a good team for the Panthers. It's also a second straight road game, which is tough. The 49ers got Brock Purdy back last week and he impressed. Bryce Young also played well for the Panthers. I think this could be a fun one to watch with the 49ers defense struggling. Look for the 49ers to win a high-scoring game. Pick: 49ers 32, Panthers 23 | Odds via FanDuel Sportsbook\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Cubs could be deemed a big success. They won 90+ games for the first time since 2018, made the playoffs for the first time since 2020 and advanced a round in the playoffs for the first time since 2017. They even took the No. 1-seeded Brewers to the limit in the NLDS before losing in Game 5. The 2025 could also be deemed a bit disappointing. They had a 6 ½-game lead in the middle of June and ended up losing the division to the Brewers by five games. They then lost to Milwaukee in the NLDS too. Is that acceptable? I'd say that overall the season was successful but settling in line behind the Brewers isn't where the Cubs should strive to be.As such, the goal for club president Jed Hoyer this offseason needs to be to partially stay the course in fielding a winning ballclub while getting a bit more aggressive in trying to be great instead of just good. \nNeedsIf you look at the offensive depth chart right now, one could argue that the Cubs could just stand pat and would have a decent-to-good team. There isn't necessarily a glaring hole unless you believe that Moisés Ballesteros can't handle the DH full-time. Remember, Kyle Tucker is a free agent. Also, it's reasonable to believe that Pete Crow-Armstrong just had the best offensive half (the first half, for those who didn't pay attention) of his career. Seiya Suzuki probably hit for more power in that first half than he could be expected to do moving forward, too. If those things are both true, in looking around the rest of the batting order, this team needs more home run power to get to where they need to go. The rotation feels similar. With Matthew Boyd, Cade Horton, Jameson Taillon, Shota Imanaga (who returns after accepting the qualifying offer), Colin Rea, Javier Assad and the returning Justin Steele -- at some point, as he's coming back from Tommy John surgery -- the rotation is technically full and isn't bad. \nIs it really good, though? It sure seems like a major-market team like the Cubs that sits right now in the mid-teens in payroll could go out and get a frontline starter for nothing more than money.  Then there's the bullpen. From the core relievers that we saw taking on high-leverage roles in the playoffs, Brad Keller, Caleb Theilbar and Drew Pomeranz are free agents in addition to Michael Soroka, Aaron Civale, Ryan Brasier and a few others. Daniel Palencia returns and maybe Porter Hodge holds onto a setup role this time around, but otherwise it's again a work in progress. The Cubs have plenty of room on their 40-man roster right now. They need to build out a bullpen, add depth in frontline talent to the rotation and build a more powerful offense. There are a lot of avenues to get there and there's a good foundation in place. It just isn't great. And after missing the playoffs four straight years for this build, is good really good enough?\nPossible targetsMy hunch is there's no chance the Cubs bring Tucker back. If they believe he's not going to age well, perhaps this is the right move. My issue is that it isn't that and instead it's just \"he's too expensive\" as the Cubs continue -- at the behest of owner Tom Ricketts -- to operate as a mid-market team when they should be a heavy hitter. Even if not like the Dodgers, Yankees or Mets, there's no reason the Cubs couldn't operate like the Phillies.Alas, it sure seems like the Cubs want to be closer to 15th in payroll than fifth. That means Tucker is out.As things stand, the Cubs have an estimated payroll for 2026 of $150 million or so. They were at nearly $210 million last season and just made the playoffs. So while we shouldn't expect a $300 million payroll, there's surely money that could be spent.\nMaybe Alex Bregman ends up as a fit here. Third base is taken for the moment, but the offense needs upgrades and he represents one. In looking for a power upgrade, perhaps Pete Alonso sits around in free agency for a while and the Cubs decide to give him the DH spot (and he could play some first base with Michael Busch serving as DH at times, too, to keep both as fresh as possible).\nOf course, there's a monster power hitter who could fill DH and Cubs fans are very familiar with him. I don't think it's going to happen for multiple reasons, but the Cubs could sure use Kyle Schwarber. The power question gets answered rather easily right there.\nAlso, corner infielder Munetaka Murakami has been posted and has serious power. \nWe heard plenty this past year about the Cubs trying to trade for arms under team control for another year or two. On that list would be Joe Ryan of the Twins (the top option!), Sandy Alcantara and Edward Cabrera of the Marlins, Mitch Keller of the Pirates, MacKenzie Gore of the Nationals and a few others. If the Cubs look to free agency for a guy who could serve as a frontline starter -- and we know they've loved lefties in recent years due to how Wrigley Field plays -- they could look to Framber Valdez or Ranger Suárez. If they went for a righty, Dylan Cease and Michael King are available. Zac Gallen could be a reclamation project not unlike the Cubs did on the position-player side with Cody Bellinger a few years ago.\nFurther, right-handed starter Tatsuya Imai from NBP is being posted and the Cubs have already been connected in rumors.\nAs for relievers, my guess is Hoyer continues to try and hit on bargain buys like he did with Keller, Theilbar and Pomeranz last season. It can work. It can also fail miserably.There's little doubt with the extra 40-man roster spots and money to spend that the Cubs will build out a deep MLB roster. The question is if there's enough high-end talent to topple the Brewers and become a major player in the National League the way the Dodgers and Phillies are. Possible trade chips I mentioned Bregman as a possibility. If the Cubs are going to do that, third baseman Matt Shaw could be traded. He had a very good second half and there are plenty of teams that would give him a shot. \nIn that same vein, young outfielder Owen Caissie and/or young catcher/DH Ballesteros could also be floated in trade talks if offseason moves put established big-leaguers in front of them on the organizational depth chart. They've earned the right to get an extended look in the majors instead of toiling in the minors. Further, I wonder if either Suzuki or Ian Happ could be traded. Happ is only under team control for one more season and you pretty much know what you're going to get at this point. He's a 4-WAR player. He's been between 3.5 and 4.3 each of the last four seasons. Suzuki had his best half stateside last season followed by a miserable second half, but then woke up for the playoffs. He's signed through next season as well.\nIf the Cubs wanted to sign Tucker (again, I don't think they will), there's an argument to be made to shed either Happ or Suzuki. Finally, if the Cubs are able to grab a frontline starter, it's feasible to believe that they could trade Taillon or another pitcher while also eating some money in the process.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Available for Maryland users only, Crab Sports is fairly new to the sports betting market in the state, having obtained its license to operate in 2023. Though the website and app offer fewer features compared to national competitors, Crab Sports offers a local and homegrown experience for those in the state who prefer it. Claim your Crab Sports promo code here:Despite more limited betting and banking options compared to other sportsbooks, Crab Sports' introductory offer of a 100% first bet profit boost (up to $500) with promo code CBSSPORTS caters more to the smaller players looking to build their initial bankroll. The player can win up to a $500 profit if their first straight, parlay, or Same Game Parlay (SGP) wager hits. We'll analyze the top features of this sportsbook and why Maryland residents and visitors should be interested in playing on Crab Sports.Crab Sports promo code: CBSSPORTS for a 100% first bet profit boostUsing promo code CBSSPORTS, new users have the opportunity to double their winnings via a 100% profit boost up to $500. The new player on Crab Sports must wager a minimum of $25 and a maximum of $500 for this promotion. Regardless of the initial bet, the maximum winnings on this first wager is $500.

Sign up here:How does the Crab Sports promo compare to other sports betting app bonus offers?Crab Sports offers a competitive initial offer for Maryland residents, giving new users the chance to win up to $500 in cash with a successful first bet. Here's how their offer stacks up against the best sportsbook promos from around the industry.SportsbookBonus OfferPromo CodeCrab Sports100% profit boost on first bet up to $500CBSSPORTSDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet wins + 3 Months of NBA League PassNone requiredFanDuelBet $5, get $150 in bonus bets if your first bet winsNone requiredFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCashCBSFANBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSCaesarsBet $1, double your winnings next 20 betsCBS20Xbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365Types of welcome promosFanDuel and DraftKings offer bet and get offers where the customer must win the first wager to receive the bonus bets (which expire after seven days). bet365 offers a similar bet and get welcome bonus, but the player will receive their bonus bets regardless of the outcome of their initial wager.BetMGM's offer of a no sweat bet up to $1500 essentially gives the customer a do-over if their first bet loses. However, the no sweat bet is paid in bonus bets, so if that second bet hits, the player will not receive the stake, only the winnings.Crab Sports' introductory offer most resembles Caesars, where a 100% profit boost is available to new customers. The difference is that Caesars offers 20 100% profit boosts (with a max. stake of $25 each) while Crab Sports gives new users one chance to go big up to $500.How to sign up for Crab Sports and claim the promo codeThose looking to sign up for CrabSports and claim this offer can follow these outlined steps:1.   Click on the link in this article to begin the process.2.   Click the SIGNUP button to start registration.3.   Fill in your personal details including name, email, address, and date of birth.4.   The next screen will ask for your address and last four digits of your Social Security number.5.   When prompted on the third screen, enter Crab Sports promo code CBSSPORTS.6.   Configure 2 Factor Authentication.7.   Make your first deposit. You can use the various deposit methods including debit card, credit card, or bank transfer.8.   Place your first wager up to $500 to redeem your 100% profit boost. How to place a bet on Crab SportsPlacing a straight wager is relatively straightforward on Crab Sports, with the user needing to click on the sport, game, and market of their choosing before selecting the dollar amount and placing the bet. For parlays and round robins, tabs appear in the betting slip making this process easy. For SGPs, it's a bit trickier compared to most other sportsbooks. A user must click on the game of choice, followed by the Same Game Parlay option, select multiple plays, and click Add to Betslip before placing the wager. Multiple SGPs are able to be combined into parlays. Get started now:Crab Sports promo and bonuses for existing usersLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports features promotions for existing users that can enhance the value of their bets. With both profit boosts and no sweat options, there is plenty for Maryland users to enjoy after the initial welcome bonus.Best Crab Sports promos this weekEvery day SGP 50% bet insurance – users can place a $50 or greater bet on a three-or-more-leg SGP (+500 odds or longer). If that first eligible bet each day loses, the player will receive a 50% free bet up to $50. This promotion is unique to Crab Sports on a daily basis and most sportsbooks will offer a similar promotion occasionally at best.Crab Parlay Boost – With qualifying bets, a percentage boost will be added for each leg of the parlay up to 50% for the 15th leg.Social giveaway – Players who win the Crab Sports social media giveaway will receive a $25 Lottery Ticket Free Bet that must be used within four days of issuance.Refer a friend – New referrals and those who refer a friend will each receive a $10 Lottery Ticket Free Bet upon using a unique code given by the existing member.Deposit matchesOccasionally, sportsbooks offer deposit matches in which the user must deposit a required amount or more before receiving additional funds via cash or bonus bets. Most sportsbooks will require the deposit + bonus amount to be wagered before requesting a withdrawal. For Crab Sports, after the first bet, all cash winnings may be withdrawn as any no sweat bets aren't considered cash.No Sweat Bet tokensUsers can apply a token where if the selected bet loses, the player will get a refund in the form of a free bet, which is not redeemable for cash.Boosted OddsGenerally two leg Same Game Parlays where the sportsbook will enhance the odds to make it more enticing to bettors.Profit boosts / SGP profit boostsLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports offers profit boosts for parlays and occasionally straight wagers. Some profit boosts incentivize adding more legs to the parlay for a greater boost.Crab Sports user experienceThe user experience at Crab Sports is friendly as the sportsbook relies on a simplistic design where the odds pop due to a different color scheme than the rest of the text. The menus are easy to follow and choosing a sport or game is no more difficult than at any other sportsbook. User InterfaceThe design of the site is appealing with several variations of blue mixed with a grey color scheme, with black, white, and blue text. I like that the odds pop on the site, with a larger font and navy-blue text against a grey background. While the design looks a bit antiquated compared to the national competition, I can't say that it's a deterrent by any means from playing on the site.Crab Sports Home Screen LayoutOn desktop, the home screen features rotating banners with promotions and top games for that night. Live betting is prominently featured in the center with the games from around the world currently in play. On the left side, Links, Popular, and All Sports give the user plenty of menu options, as does a bar with each sport's icon towards the top. The My Selections tab on the right is visible throughout so you can see which picks you have selected. Overall, Crab Sports provides a clean look and is easily navigable on computers.On mobile, the home screen shows the sport icons at the very top, followed by rotating banners, and the live games. The menus at the bottom include Home, A-Z Sports, an icon to view your selections, Live, and My Bets. Once again, a very clean design for users and easy to navigate for both new and experienced players.Sportsbook app design, speed, functionalitySimilar to the desktop site, the odds pop on the app with larger navy-blue text against a lighter background. The functionality works similarly to the desktop site and lag doesn't seem to be an issue in my testing. But it's hard to compare Crab Sports' app to the feature-rich national brands such as DraftKings and FanDuel.For players who know what they want to bet when coming to the site, Crab Sports provides a fine experience. But if you're looking to browse random odds and categories, you have to go game-by-game at Crab Sports vs. menu items showing all games on several other sites.Geolocation issues can be common on any sportsbook app but in most cases has not been a major complaint of Crab Sports customers thus far.

When it comes to props though, the selections are much fewer compared to the larger sportsbooks, which allow more customization as compared to just over/under a set yardage or hits total for example.The Same Game Parlay builder seems like a first-generation version of what we see on the likes of DraftKings, FanDuel, and Fanatics now and can be tedious. You must click on the builder before adding SGP picks which is a feature of the past on most books. There have been customer reviews stating that live betting cashout offers don't compare favorably to most other sportsbooks, with early cashout offers seemingly lower than other books.Crab Sports key betting featuresCrab Sports offers many of the same betting features found in most apps including:Early CashoutWhile its offers are not as financially friendly as some of the larger sportsbooks, Crab Sports does offer the ability for users to get out of eligible bets before their conclusion with a profit or loss.Live BettingCrab Sports gives Maryland users the opportunity to bet during just about any sporting event while in progress. Odds changes are easy to note with green and red arrows upon any line movement.SGP generationNot only can users create SGPs, they may parlay multiple SGPs, albeit each one must be created separately. For eligible games, a Same Game Parlay button appears which must be selected before options are chosen.How to track your bets on Crab SportsOn desktop, the My Selection tab on the right side of the page makes it easy to follow along with your bets. The My Bets tab allows you to view your existing wagers. On the app, the icon of a ticket in the center at the bottom makes it easy for players to make their selections. To track selections on the app, My Bets on the bottom right is the place to click.Crab Sports customer supportIn addition to comprehensive help, rules, and FAQ pages, users with an issue may email support@crabsports.com, with the response time usually within an hour or two. Crab Sports does not feature a live chat as most other sportsbooks offer.Betting on Maryland sports teamsCrab Sports is a sportsbook exclusively for Maryland sports bettors. All championship odds are for the 2025-26 seasons and from Crab Sports (updated 10/10/25).Baltimore Ravens (NFL) (+1700)With superstars (quarterback) Lamar Jackson and (running back) Derrick Henry, the Ravens were expected to be a Super Bowl contender again in 2025. Baltimore seeks its third Super Bowl title, having won in the 2001 and 2013 seasons. As long as Jackson is healthy and leading Baltimore, the Ravens should remain a threat in the AFC playoffs.Washington Commanders (NFL) (+1900)Led 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year, QB Jayden Daniels, Washington D.C.'s team is capable of making another sustained run in the playoffs. Daniels looks like an elite quarterback as he was projected to be after winning the Heisman Trophy in college.Washington Wizards (NBA) (+49900)As the team with the worst odds to win it all per Crab Sports, this doesn't appear to be a year of promise for the rebuilding Wizards franchise.Baltimore Orioles (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)At 75-87, the Orioles finished last in the American League East Division, which produced three playoff teams. They will look to bounce back in 2026 with a young core including shortstop Gunnar Henderson and second baseman Jackson Holliday.Washington Nationals (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)The 2019 World Series champions are in rebuilding mode for the next few years, as evidenced by a 66-96 campaign in 2025. Outfielder James Wood is the team's brightest star with some additional promising prospects in need of more MLB seasoning.Washington Capitals (NHL) (+2900)The NHL's all-time leading goal scorer, Alex Ovechkin, looks to close out his career in style, adding a second Stanley Cup championship to his resume. Washington most recently won sports' greatest trophy in 2017.Crab Sports responsible gaming toolsAt the bottom of the page on both desktop and mobile, users can click on the Responsible Gambling section.The sections on that page's FAQ include:How to play responsiblyWhat is Problem Gambling?What support is available?What tools can you use to manage your gambling?Voluntary ExclusionUnderage GamblingLinks on the page for gambling help resources include:MD Gambling HelpMD Problem GamblingMD LotteryMaryland State Lottery & Gaming Control AgencyNational Council on Problem GamblingGamblers AnonymousGam-AnonInternational Center for Responsible Gaming988 Suicide & Crising Lifeline Crab Sports banking methodsCrab Sports offers a number of ways for customers to deposit and withdraw money.Deposit methodsThese deposit methods are available for most users.Quick deposit methodsFeesProcess timeMin. depositOnline Banking (via Plaid)$0Instant$10Debit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Credit Card ((VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Withdrawal methodsHere are the primary ways to withdraw money at Crab Sports.Withdrawal optionProcess TimeMax withdrawalOnline Banking (via Plaid)1-2 business daysUnknownDebit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)1-2 business daysUnknownCrab Sports review: Final verdictFor Maryland users, Crab Sports is a fine alternative to the national sportsbooks. The design is simplistic but the interface is easy to use. If you're looking for the bells and whistles of additional menus, a search function, and more individual player betting options, then this isn't the right sportsbook for you. But if you're located in the state and want to take advantage of the generous signup offer, Crab Sports is worth a long look.The app works well and betting pregame or during the live action is easy. Betting SGPs is slower than at other sportsbooks, but at least it is still possible. There are limited options for deposits / withdrawals and the customer support is only via email. This sportsbook does not offer a rewards program as of now. Nonetheless, I recommend giving Crab Sports a shot if you're in Maryland.Honest feedback for how Crab Sports can improveEnhance Same Game Parlay betting: Compared to other sportsbooks, betting SGPs is slow. Clicking on multiple lines / props from the same game should automatically trigger an SGP, whereas now it only works if you press a specific button.Offer more menus for betting selected markets: Similar to BetMGM who also falls short in this category, Crab Sports should create menus so users don't have to click on each game separately to add a certain market.More deposit and withdrawal options: It seems almost standard that options such as PayPal and Venmo, which allow seamless money transfers, should be allowed at every sportsbook. This is a necessary addition in due time for Crab Sports.Crab Sports FAQHow do you get the Crab Sports promo?Use promo code CBSSPORTS on the third page of the registration screen and deposit up to $500 to receive a 100% profit boost on your first wager.How long do Crab Sports withdrawals take?Generally 1-2 business days, if not faster for withdrawals via debit card and online banking.Can you cash out bonus bets on Crab Sports?No, all bonus bets must be played through before attempting to redeem them for cash.How do you contact Crab Sports?Email support@crabsports.com with any questions or inquiries.Do you need a promo code for Crab Sports?Yes, use promo code CBSSPORTS when initially signing up.Does Crab Sports have a good rewards program?To date, there has been no mention of a rewards program for Crab Sports.Where is Crab Sports available?You may only play on Crab Sports if you're physically located in Maryland and are 21 years of age or older.\n            ",

He originally picked the Cornhuskers over offers from Appalachian State and Charlotte and is currently ranked as the No. 76 quarterback in the class per 247Sports.The Raiola name is entrenched in Nebraska football; Dylan and Dayton's father, Dominic, starred for the Cornhuskers in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and their uncle (Dominic's brother) Donovan is Nebraska's current offensive line coach.\nDylan Raiola, meanwhile, is out for the season after suffering a broken fibula Nov. 1 against USC. A former five-star recruit in the 2024 class, he had started delivering on that billing as a sophomore, throwing for 18 touchdowns and just six interceptions and completing 72.4% of his passes as the Huskers got off to a 6-2 start.Nebraska, now 7-3, does have solid depth at the quarterback spot. True freshman TJ Lateef threw for three touchdowns in his first collegiate start -- a 28-21 win over UCLA -- and behind him is Marcos Davila, a former four-star recruit who transferred in from Purdue. The Cornhuskers also have a commitment from four-star 2027 quarterback Trae Taylor and are off to a fast start with that class as a whole.\nStill, this counts as another blow to Rhule's 2026 recruiting work; Nebraska now has just nine recruits in the upcoming high school class, which is ranked 100th in the nation per 247Sports.\n            \n    ",

Simple. They have been better all season and, over the long haul, forcing the opposing team's star, who happens to be one of the best and most electric players ever, to go into superhero mode just to squeak past you is a good thing. \nMeanwhile, the Lakers got LeBron James back and kept right on rolling. The Pistons can't lose. Neither can the Raptors. The Rockets are the league's best offense without a point guard. And Atlanta might actually be better without Trae Young. All this and more in this week's Power Rankings. Note: As a general Power Rankings rule, we're going to try to strike a balance between what we're seeing so far and what can reasonably be expected to play out over, say, the next few weeks to a month. We will not go so far as to rank these teams based on championship expectations, because in that case it would take a lot more to alter, at least in tiers, the generally accepted hierarchy. Winning matters, and it will get you on the move up this board form week to week. But if you're beating bad teams, just as an example, and probably playing a little above your head, it's not necessarily going to be reflected in a completely commensurate climb up the rankings. Or vice versa. \n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                9\n            \n                Hawks\n            \n                6\n            \n                Heat\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Thunder\n                                \n                            The Thunder have lost one game and that required them coughing up a 22-point lead.

So what? The Nuggets remain top three in offensive, defensive and net rating. They're still losing the non-Jokić minutes at minus-6.8 per 100, per CTG, but that's actually the best non-Jokić rating Denver has had dating back to the championship season. \n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            10-3\n                        \n                                3\n                            \n                                    Rockets\n                                \n                            The Rockets have won four straight and nine of their last 10 by way of the league's best offense and a frontline that is pulling down offensive rebounds at a literal historic rate.

Elite defense and an offense with an MVP-level leader in Cade Cunningham and the best offensive rebounder in the league in Jalen Duren, who is blowing up in front of our eyes. Duren is averaging 25 points on 75% shooting and 12.8 boards over his last five games.  \n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            13-2\n                        \n                                5\n                            \n                                    Lakers\n                                \n                            LeBron James tallied 12 assists in his season debut, a win over the Jazz, and the Lakers have now won three straight and four of their last five with a super soft schedule coming up to get LeBron up to speed. One thing to watch: Can James give the Lakers a transition presence? Entering LeBron's debut, the Lakers were recording the fourth-fewest fast-break points with the league's lowest transition frequency, per CTG. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            11-4\n                        \n                                6\n                            \n                                    Spurs\n                                \n                            The Spurs got back on track with a couple just-what-the-doctor-ordered wins over Sacramento and Memphis after Steph Curry single-handedly ripped their hearts out with 95 points in back-to-back losses. Now Victor Wembanyama is out a couple weeks with a calf strain and the Spurs have a pretty tough stretch of games over that span. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            10-4\n                        \n                                7\n                            \n                                    Cavaliers\n                                \n                            The Cavs are sitting in the East's No. 2 spot and Darius Garland is expected back soon. Donovan Mitchell is having an extraordinary season and he's doing it without having to significantly up his usage with Garland missing so much time. Cleveland is in a good spot and ultimately still feels like the team to beat in the East. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            10-5\n                        \n                                8\n                            \n                                    Timberwolves\n                                \n                            The Wolves are quietly the No. 5 offense in the league. No. 3 in true-shooting percentage. No. 5 in 3-point percentage. Minnesota is 9-5 with three very winnable games coming up against the Wizards, Suns and Kings. Things could be looking very good by this time next week. \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            9-5\n                        \n                                9\n                            \n                                    Knicks\n                                \n                            The Knicks have won six of their last eight, but now Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby are hurt. Hopefully Brunson won't be out for long with a sprained ankle, but the offense is going to suffer while he is, as is the defense without Anunoby, as the on/off numbers in both cases indicate. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            8-5\n                        \n                                10\n                            \n                                    Raptors\n                                \n                            Don't look now, but the Raptors have won eight of their last nine games. This team really pushes (No. 1 in fast break points) and shares (No. 3 in assists) the ball. They have three legit 20-point scorers and a sensational rookie in Collin Murray-Boyles. Scottie Barnes would be a lock for an All-Star spot and maybe All-NBA if voting were held now. Still, it's hard to know how legit all this is or if a lot of shots are just going in at the moment. Last season, Toronto ranked 24th in eFG%, per CTG. So far this season, they're No. 6 despite an average shot diet. \n                        \n                            5\n                        \n                            9-5\n                        \n                                11\n                            \n                                    Hawks\n                                \n                            Atlanta fell to Detroit on the back end of a back-to-back on Tuesday. No shame in that. The Hawks are 8-3 since Trae Young went down (counting the win over Brooklyn in which he played seven minutes) by way of a top-five defense and a suddenly equitable offense that is leading the league in assists.\n                        \n                            9\n                        \n                            9-6\n                        \n                                12\n                            \n                                    Bulls\n                                \n                            After crashing back to earth with a five-game losing streak, Chicago scored a huge win over Denver on Monday. Not coincidentally, it was Josh Giddey's second game back after he missed three straight. Chicago has a soft stretch of games coming up, a good opportunity to once again build up their record in the early going after falling back to .500 pre-Denver.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            7-6\n                        \n                                13\n                            \n                                    76ers\n                                \n                            The Sixers are treading a little bit of water at 3-4 over their last seven. Narrow wins over the Celtics and Clippers, by two points each, helped the cause. Paul George is back. Joel Embiid is hurt again and hasn't played in more than a week. That might not hurt the offense, which is way less reliant on him these days, but Philly's defense falls to what would register as the second-worst rating in the league without him (he's only played in six games this season so make of that what you will. but it's something to note). \n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            8-5\n                        \n                                14\n                            \n                                    Suns\n                                \n                            The Suns have been one of the biggest early season surprises. They let a big one get away by coughing up a 22-point lead to the Hawks on Sunday, but they rebounded by beating Portland on Tuesday. That was big, because the Suns are about to enter a treacherous schedule stretch that lasts through Christmas and they are going to need every bit of cushion they've built so far to come out of it anywhere near .500.\n                        \n                            3\n                        \n                            9-6\n                        \n                                15\n                            \n                                    Heat\n                                \n                            When you play four straight games against the Cavs and Knicks and come out 2-2 you'll take it. Norman Powell is becoming an honest-to-god star and the Heat play a drag-race pace, but neither the offense nor defense is a top-10 unit and a tough stretch of games awaits. The Heat have been a surprise, but it feels like they'll be at or below-.500 before too long.\n                        \n                            6\n                        \n                            8-6\n                        \n                                16\n                            \n                                    Magic\n                                \n                            Orlando scored a win over a clearly tired Golden State team on Tuesday. The Magic have now won four of their last five with the only loss being a OT thriller against the Rockets that they had all but won in regulation. Paolo Banchero is out with a groin strain and, at least against the Warriors, the offense did look more energized. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            8-7\n                        \n                                17\n                            \n                                    Bucks\n                                \n                            The Bucks continue to survive on a lot of shots going in. They are No. 1 in the league in team eFG% and have five guys shooting at least 42% from 3 on at least three attempts per game. That doesn't include Gary Trent Jr. at 37% on high volume or Giannis Antetokounmpo's 9 for 18 start from deep. But now Anteokounmpo is hurt and the Bucks are just one game above .500 with a bottom-10 defense.

It is, however, fun to watch. Curry went for 95 points in consecutive wins over San Antonio, but his shot betrayed him after a hot start against Orlando and nobody was there to pick up the slack. This is a tired team with only one real source of consistent juice, and that source is 37 years old. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            9-7\n                        \n                                19\n                            \n                                    Celtics\n                                \n                            The Celtics have won three straight and five of their last seven. Now, their three most recent wins have come against the Grizzlies, Clippers and Nets, who are a combined 10-33 this year, so let's not get too excited. But look, the Celtics are top 10 in both offense and defense and with Jaylen Brown, Derrick White and Payton Pritchard all having down years from 3. As soon as that turns around, well, then we'll just have to worry about all the offensive rebounds the Celtics give up.\n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            8-7\n                        \n                                20\n                            \n                                    Trail Blazers\n                                \n                            A top-five defense early on has fallen into the bottom 10. Now the Blazers are having players-only meetings and the ledger ain't looking so hot with five losses in their last six games. Missing Jrue Holiday in the loss to Dallas (ouch) didn't help.

They had the Raptors on the brink on Monday and took Milwaukee to OT with Giannis playing. It appears they hit the jackpot with Kon Knueppel and fellow rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner.

The bad news is the trade to get him was still a disaster as New Orleans gave its unprotected 2026 first-rounder to the Hawks in a loaded class and the Pelicans are sure to be in the running for a top-three pick. I also like what I'm seeing out of Jeremiah Fears, at least to the degree that you can like small scoring guards who are going to have to prove a lot of people wrong just to be an average shooter.\n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            2-12\n                        \n                                29\n                            \n                                    Nets\n                                \n                            Hey, Michael Porter Jr. has scored at least 20 points in seven straight games.

Mary Carillo was elected to the Hall in the contributor category for her work as a TV commentator and journalist. The induction ceremony will take place over the weekend of Aug. 27-29 at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. \"It's a tremendous honor to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and to stand alongside so many of the game's great champions,\" Federer said in a statement. \"Throughout my career, I've always valued the history of tennis and the example set by those who came before me. It was very special to receive the news at Swiss Tennis, surrounded by the next generation of players -- the place where my own journey first began. To be recognized in this way by the sport and by my peers is deeply humbling. I look forward to visiting Newport next August to celebrate this special moment with the tennis community.\"Federer became the first male tennis player to win 20 Grand Slam singles titles, breaking Pete Sampras' then-record of 14 back in 2009. Federer dominated on the grass court and hard court during his career, winning eight championships at Wimbledon, six Australian Open titles and five US Open titles, and finally broke through for his lone French Open title on the clay in 2009. He made 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005 to 2007, winning eight of those in a previously unheard of run of dominance in the majors. He also added an Olympic gold medal in doubles with Stan Wawrinka in 2008. \nWhile his Grand Slam titles record was eventually broken by Rafael Nadal and then Novak Djokovic, his longevity and consistency at the top of the sport were something never seen in tennis before him. Overall, Federer won 103 singles tournaments and 1,251 singles matches, second all-time in the Open era to Jimmy Connors. He was the No. 1 player in the world for a record-setting 237 consecutive weeks (and 310 overall in his career). \n            \n    ",

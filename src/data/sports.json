    "body": "\n        NFL Week 14 concludes with a 'Monday Night Football' matchup between a couple of 8-4 teams with the Philadelphia Eagles visiting the Los Angeles Chargers at 8:15 p.m. ET. The over/under is 41.5, so points could be tough to come by. Top NFL DFS picks for this contest include Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown, Kimani Vidal, Keenan Allen and Omarion Hampton, who has been activated from the IR (ankle) and is expected to play on Monday. Anyone experienced with fielding NFL DFS lineups, however, knows that finding the right balance between highly priced stars and economical options is a must. Thus, perhaps your daily Fantasy football strategy may consider Chargers rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden for MNF DFS lineups?The fifth-round pick has the sixth-most Fantasy points amongst tight ends since Week 6.

Hurts is running more as of late, with 30+ yards rushing in three straight, and his eight scores on the ground rank seventh in the NFL.

    "body": "\n        Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the team announced. Ertz exited the game in the third quarter after taking an ugly hit to the leg from Vikings defensive back Jay Ward.On the play, Ertz leapt as he tried to reel in a high throw from quarterback Marcus Mariota. As Ertz was in the air, Ward undercut him with a hit directly to his knee. The blow bent Ertz' knee backward and flipped him in midair. Trainers quickly rushed onto the field to attend to Ertz, and he had to be carted off the field.In his Monday press conference, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Ertz has been an \"ideal teammate\" since joining the team in 2024. He also said Ertz helped build a culture of hard work and attention to detail.\"The habits, that what stuck out to me more than anything,\" Quinn said of Ertz. \"Just doing the extra and not getting bored with the details whether it was hitting the Jugs, footwork or the technique part of it. ... Those are the type of elite habits when you're putting a program together that's like, 'That's what it looks like, and I want to point that out whenever I can.' It's been significant for us.\"\nThe 35-year-old Ertz was the Commanders' second-leading receiver on the season with 50 catches for 504 yards and four touchdowns. With Ertz on a one-year contract, his NFL future is now in question.A second-round pick by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2013, Ertz established himself as one of the most productive tight ends of his era. In 13 seasons, split between the Eagles, Commanders and Arizona Cardinals, Ertz totaled 825 receptions for 8,527 yards and 57 touchdowns.As a member of the Eagles, Ertz earned Pro Bowl honors in three consecutive seasons from 2017-19. He was also a hero in Philadelphia's Super Bowl LII win over the New England Patriots with seven catches, 67 receiving yards and what proved to be the game-winning touchdown reception.\nIn 2020, injuries and the emergence of Dallas Goedert reduced Ertz's role within the Eagles' offense. Just six games into the 2021 season, the Eagles traded Ertz to the Arizona Cardinals, where he played for three seasons before signing with the Commanders in 2024.Ertz had a late-career resurgence with the Commanders last season as he caught 66 passes for 654 yards and seven touchdowns. He helped Washington reach the NFC Championship Game, where he caught 11 passes for 104 yards in a losing effort against the Eagles.The loss of Ertz is just another in a long line of devastating injuries the Commanders have dealt with in 2025. Most notably, star quarterback Jayden Daniels and No. 1 wide receiver Terry McLaurin both missed significant time. Daniels even left Sunday's game shortly before Ertz did, although Quinn said Daniels could have gone back in but was held out for precautionary reasons.\n            ",

The Chargers are getting healthier here with the return of running back Omarion Hampton, but they'll have to navigate the injury to Justin Herbert. They're looking to keep pace in the AFC wild card race and stay within potential striking distance of the Denver Broncos in the AFC West.Philadelphia has lost back-to-back games to drop its record to 8-4 and looks like it is in a bad way at the moment. The coaching staff and the players are increasingly coming under fire despite the fact that the Eagles look to be in full control of the division and on their way to a playoff spot. There's a lot of angst in Philadelphia right now, and a win in this game would go a long way toward alleviating it.Will the Chargers deal the Eagles their third loss in a row, or will Philadelphia break the streak? We'll find out soon enough. But before we clue you into some key storylines for this matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Eagles vs. ChargersDate: Monday, Dec. 8 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Eagles -1.5, O/U 41.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Eagles battle the Chargers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nKey storylinesJustin Herbert's injury. Herbert broke a bone in his hand last week against the Raiders. He briefly left the game and was replaced by Trey Lance, but he later returned wearing a padded glove. He had surgery on the hand last week and was limited in practices throughout the week. It'll be interesting to see how he handles snaps from under center, or whether the Chargers go exclusively shotgun throughout the game to protect his hand. How he handles the Eagles pass rush is also worth monitoring, given that he probably doesn't want to take very many hits and risk injuring the hand any further. Eagles offensive struggles. Philadelphia has not scored more than 21 points since its Week 9 bye. The Eagles have struggled to run the ball and they have struggled to throw the ball with any degree of consistency, and they've also turned the ball over five times in their four post-bye games. The Chargers have an excellent defense that is fresh off holding the Raiders to an anemic 156 total yards and 31 rushing yards, so it could be some tough sledding if the Eagles can't get back to doing the things they used to do well. Nick Sirianni reportedly had a greater hand in the offensive game plan this week, so we'll see how he and OC Kevin Patullo decide to attack L.A.'s defense.Omarion Hampton's return. Hampton has been out since Week 5, when he suffered a fracture in his ankle. He was off to a terrific start to his rookie season before going down, but he's also been out for more than two full months. He's expected to split carries with Kimani Vidal in some form or fashion, but we don't yet know how that split will look. Vidal had some really good games in Hampton's absence, but was also somewhat inconsistent, seemingly going off every other week. Still, he should provide a nice one-two punch with Hampton and keep the latter fresh as he works his way back into the lineup.Playoff picture. The Chargers are currently 8-4 and in sixth place in the AFC. They're a half-game behind the Bills for the No. 5 seed. With a win, they would jump ahead of Buffalo and take over that fifth slot. With a loss, they'd drop to 8-5 and move behind the Colts and Texans, out of the field entirely. Philadelphia is also 8-4 and owns the No. 3 seed in the NFC thanks to its control of the NFC East. The Eagles can't move up or drop down in the NFC standings based on the result of this game, but they could extend their division lead over the Cowboys and keep pace with the 9-3-1 Packers for the No. 2 seed if they come away with a win. Bet Chargers vs. Eagles at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins.Chargers vs. Eagles prediction, pick\nThe Justin Herbert hand surgery has me off the Chargers in this game. Even if they get Omarion Hampton back, I don't know how effective we can expect the offense to be -- even against a defense that has struggled the last two weeks. We know the type of ceiling Vic Fangio's unit can reach. Do I trust the Eagles' offense at all here? Nope. But I'll back the team whose quarterback at least is not injured. \nPick: Eagles 21, Chargers 17 | (Philadelphia -1.5, Under 41.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Chiefs offensive lineman Wanya Morris is out for the season due to a knee injury he suffered on Kansas City's opening play of their Week 14 \"Sunday Night Football\" loss to the Texans, ESPN is reporting. The broadcast declined to show replays, but social media clips showed Morris' left knee hyperextending at a gruesome angle.Morris was only starting because normal starting left tackle Josh Simmons is on IR after undergoing surgery to repair his dislocated and fractured left wrist suffered in Kansas City's Thanksgiving Day loss to the Cowboys. Esa Pole, an undrafted rookie out of Washington State who was only called up to the active roster after Simmons' injury, came in to take Morris' place in the eventual 20-10 loss.Chiefs offensive line injuries continueIt's yet another devastating loss up front for Kansas City, which is also without Pro Bowl right guard Trey Smith and right tackle Jawaan Taylor.Chiefs offensive lineWeek 1 vs. ChargersEnd of Week 14 vs. TexansLeft tackleJosh SimmonsEsa PoleLeft guardKingsley SuamataiaKingsley SuamataiaCenterCreed HumphreyCreed HumphreyRight guardTrey SmithMike CaliendoRight tackleJawaan TaylorJaylon MooreOverall, the Chiefs have used 17 different offensive line combinations this season. The most-used group -- the Week 1 starters -- has played 379 offensive snaps together, 14th-most of all offensive line combinations, but that group has played in just two games since Week 6.Simmons, the 32nd overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, was away from the team from Weeks 6-10 for personal reasons. Smith (ankle) got hurt in a Week 12 win over the Colts, and Taylor (triceps/ankle), like Simmons, got hurt in Week 13 against the Cowboys.What's next for Chiefs?Both Smith and Taylor were listed as doubtful ahead of the Texans game before being ruled out. Neither have been placed on injured reserve, a potentially good sign, but Simmons will miss at least another three weeks due to his placement on IR.Should Taylor be able to return soon, Kansas City could try to flip Moore back to left tackle, which is where he played during Simmons' first absence.It's been a trying season for Kansas City (6-7) for several reasons, including the rotating offensive line groups. Sunday, Patrick Mahomes threw three interceptions and took two sacks. It was Mahomes' fourth career three-interception game, and his first with three interceptions and no passing touchdowns.The Chiefs currently occupy the No. 10 seed in the AFC standings and are two games behind No. 7 Houston, who are in the final playoff spot, and No. 8 Indianapolis. The Chiefs have the head-to-head edge over the Colts but do not over the Texans.Kansas City's road doesn't get much easier, either. The Chiefs host the Chargers, whom they lost to in Week 1, in Week 15. They finish the season with the Titans, Broncos and Raiders.SportsLine currently gives Kansas City a 9% chance to make the playoffs; it has not missed the playoffs since 2014.\n            ",

Pass rusher Trey Hendrickson is set to undergo core muscle surgery, and could be sidelined around six weeks, according to ESPN. The issue has not corrected itself with rest and rehab, which reportedly has Hendrickson turning to surgery.Hendrickson has not played since Week 8 with what the team has called a hip/pelvis injury. In seven games played this season, he has recorded 16 tackles, eight QB hits, four sacks and three tackles for loss. Hendrickson led the NFL in sacks last season with 17.5, and became just the fifth player in NFL history to record 17 sacks in back-to-back seasons. He recorded 49% of the Bengals' sacks last season, which was the highest rate in the NFL and the eighth-highest percentage in NFL history. Cincinnati had the NFL's leader in passing yards with Joe Burrow, the NFL's leader in receiving yards with Ja'Marr Chase and the sack king in Hendrickson, yet still missed the playoffs.After yet another contract-related standoff this offseason, Hendrickson agreed to accept a $14 million raise in August to bring his 2025 salary to $30 million. It's possible he has played his last down with the Bengals, as the 31-year-old is set to hit free agency. \nFollowing the Week 14 loss to the Buffalo Bills, the Bengals are going to need some help to make the postseason. The 7-6 Pittsburgh Steelers have a 73% chance to win the AFC North, while the Bengals have a 3.1% chance to capture the division and make the playoffs, according to SportsLine. Cincinnati closes out the year hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, at the Miami Dolphins in Week 16, vs. the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17 and vs. the Cleveland Browns in Week 18. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        When the final College Football Playoff rankings were announced, Notre Dame saw its postseason hopes dissolve. Alabama remained at No. 9 after getting blasted in the SEC Championship. Despite both teams being idle, Miami jumped the Irish for the No. 10 spot after weeks of being ranked behind them. It was both shocking and somewhat predictable, as there was never going to be an acceptable outcome given the way the committee handled this situation all year. Notre Dame felt bamboozled by a number of parties; the committee; the CFP's TV partner, ESPN; and the ACC. As a result, Notre Dame declined all bowl bids, a move some believe was a bit of a parting shot at ESPN, which broadcasts and operates most bowl games. Pete Bevacqua, the school's athletic director, has been making the rounds to voice Notre Dame's displeasure with the situation. He joined the Dan Patrick Show Monday where he addressed the ACC's role in the situation.\"We have no gripes about any of the schools in the ACC. But we were mystified by the actions of the conference to attack their biggest business partner in football and a member of their conference in 24 of our other sports,\" Bevacqua said. \"And I wouldn't be honest with you if I didn't say that they've certainly done permanent damage between the conference and Notre Dame.\"\n\"Just we didn't appreciate the fact that we were singled out repeatedly and compared to Miami,\" Bevacqua explained when asked to elaborate. \"Not by Miami -- Miami has every right to do that -- but it raised a lot of eyebrows here that the conference was taking shots at us.\" The relationship between Notre Dame and the ACC certainly complicated matters here, but when push came to shove, there was never a world where the ACC wouldn't back one of their actual member programs in favor of a \"business partner,\" as Bevacqua put it.ACC commissioner Jim Phillips said as much in a statement on Monday.\"The University of Notre Dame is an incredibly valued member of the ACC and there is tremendous respect and appreciation for the entire institution,\" Phillips said. \"With that said, when it comes to football, we have a responsibility to support and advocate for all 17 of our football-playing member institutions, and I stand behind our conference efforts to do just that leading up to the College Football Playoff Committee selections on Sunday.\n\"At no time was it suggested by the ACC that Notre Dame was not a worthy candidate for inclusion in the field. We are thrilled for the University of Miami while also understanding and appreciating the significant disappointment of the Notre Dame players, coaches and program.\"Notre Dame is an ACC member in most other sports. In football, they have a deal to play five games per season against ACC teams while retaining their beloved independency. They recently added a long-term scheduling agreement with Clemson to play each year from 2027-38 that raised some questions among other ACC programs about how that will impact the Irish's agreement, and it seems there is some serious tension building within their partnership. As for what the ramifications are for the \"permanent damage\" Bevacqua claims has been done by the ACC stumping for the Canes, that's not abundantly clear. Perhaps the Irish will look to solidify more scheduling deals with the ACC's biggest programs, frustrating others who could lose home games with Notre Dame that would be huge revenue drivers. \nThe biggest problem Notre Dame should have with the ACC is that they could have avoided this debacle with a better tiebreaker policy to put the highest ranked teams in the ACC title game. Miami winning the ACC would have kept Notre Dame in the field as the final at-large team, but instead the Canes watched as their old friend Manny Diaz and Duke win an ACC title before them. All of this will become a moot issue next year when Notre Dame's MOU with the Playoff kicks in and they're guaranteed a spot if they rank inside the top 12. That doesn't help the Irish this year, and in the meantime they're searching for anyone to blame other than themselves for losing their first two games against their two best opponents. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cincinnati Bengals waived Jermaine Burton. The Bengals parted ways with Burton, a 2024 third-round NFL Draft pick, one day after suspending him without pay ahead of their Week 14 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The Bengals drafted Burton with the hope that he could complement fellow receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins as a receiving option for quarterback Joe Burrow. That plan never materialized as Burton caught just four passes for 107 yards during his time with the Bengals. Burton played in 14 games (with one start) as a rookie but didn't appear in any games this season for the Bengals, who are 4-9 entering this Sunday's home game against the Baltimore Ravens. Burton continued to be a non-factor for the Bengals despite expressing optimism this summer that things would be different this season. \"Nobody should be happy with it,\" Burton said at the time when discussing his rookie season. \"I was very disappointed, but it's something that I moved on from and grew from. ... I'm just trying my best to be the best player I can be. I learned a lot of things last year. You've really got to be a professional in this league.\"\nIn January, Burton was accused of assaulting a woman, although no charges were filed against him. During his college career at Alabama, there was an allegation that Burton struck a female Tennessee fan during the aftermath of the Volunteers' upset win over the Crimson Tide. There were also issues regarding Burton's ability to be a dependable teammate. Cincinnati benched him for the team's midseason win over the Raiders during his rookie season after missing practice time. Ahead of the team's season-finale against the Steelers, it was announced that Burton wouldn't travel to Pittsburgh with the rest of his teammates due to a coach's decision. One of Burton's college coaches, Nick Saban, delivered some telling comments shortly after Cincinnati drafted Burton with the 80th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. \n\"Jermaine Burton is a tremendous competitor,\" said Saban, who was working the draft as an analyst. \"He's got great quickness. He's got really good speed. He can come in and out of a break, he can come man-to-man. I really, really like this guy. \"The No. 1 thing that he needs to do and I think emotional maturity is the best way to say it. Do the right things all the time. If he does the right things on the field, he knows the importance of what he has to do on the field, he wants to be a player, that's all he thinks about. But you got to do the right things in your life all the time so that you can do the best things that you can do on the field and be the best you can be.\"That never appeared to happen in Cincinnati for Burton, who will now begin the process of finding his next opportunity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Heisman Trophy finalists were announced on Monday and the list of stars headed to New York features some of the best and brightest from a particularly chaotic football season. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love will all take center stage during Saturday's ceremony, which is set to begin at 8 p.m. ET, but only one will be crowned as the 80th Heisman Trophy winner. It certainly seems like a quarterback will be taking the Heisman Trophy home this year after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter broke the streak of three straight quarterback winners last season. Mendoza and Pavia are the two favorites to win the award now that most votes have been cast following championship game weekend. Though a quarterback winning the Heisman is nothing new, it would still be a historic triumph for either Mendoza or Pavia -- neither Indiana nor Vanderbilt have ever produced a Heisman winner. Neither Sayin nor Love should be entirely discounted. Sayin started at quarterback for the best team in college football -- entering the Big Ten Championship Game, at least -- and Love is one of the most talented running backs to pass through Notre Dame in the modern era.Here's a more detailed look at the four players who made the cut for the 2025 Heisman Trophy. \nFernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana Mendoza is now the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy after his heroic performance in Indiana's Big Ten Championship Game win against Ohio State. Mendoza helped the Hoosiers capture their first outright conference title in 80 years with 15 completions for 222 yards and one touchdown. He effectively sealed the 13-10 victory with a perfectly placed 33-yard pass to wide receiver Charlie Becker that converted a third-and-6 with just over two minutes to play. Mendoza also orchestrated the crucial 88-yard touchdown drive in which he completed passes of 51 yards and 17 yards for the decisive score. That brought his stats on the year to a respectable 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns through the air. He also rushed for six touchdowns. Mendoza won't win because of the box score, though, but more for his impact in leading a historically deficient program to new heights. Diego Pavia, QB, VanderbiltSpeaking of leading programs that have struggled historically, Pavia is the engine behind Vanderbilt's modern Renaissance under coach Clark Lea. He's emerged as one of the nation's premier playmakers -- akin to Johnny Manziel and the freestyling gunslingers of yore -- and his hot close to the season has him on the precipice of winning college football's most prestigious individual award. He averaged a whopping 455.8 total yards of offense and was responsible for 16 touchdowns in Vanderbilt's last four games. He rushed for 165 yards on 8.3 yards per carry in Vanderbilt's regular season finale against Tennessee, which helped propel the Commodores to their first win against their in-state rival since 2018. Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State Sayin's Heisman outlook seems to have faded in the wake of Ohio State's Big Ten Championship Game loss, though he turned in a solid 258-yard, one-touchdown performance. That also marked the 11th game this season in which he completed at least 70% of his passes. It should come as no surprise that his 78.4% completion rate leads all FBS quarterbacks. As does his 182.1 passer rating among quarterbacks that have thrown the ball at least 100 times this season. Sayin has at least one more year before he's eligible for the NFL Draft, so there's a good chance this won't be the last time he's involved in the Heisman conversation. \nJeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame Love most likely won't win the Heisman, but he certainly belongs at the ceremony. He's powered Notre Dame's offense all season long as one of the most explosive runners in college football. Love is one of just two running backs at the FBS level with at least 1,000 yards rushing on 6.9 yards per carry. His eight-carry, 171-yard performance in Notre Dame's 70-7 win against Syracuse was one of the best rushing performances all season. It's also rather typical of what Love accomplished with the Fighting Irish.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mike Tomlin had plenty of reasons to blow a kiss to the CBS camera after the Steelers' 27-22 win over the Ravens on Sunday.The win came one week after he heard \"Fire Tomlin\" chants during a 23-6 home loss to the Bills. He spent the week addressing his future, hearing reports and speculation about his future and even hearing his former Super Bowl-winning quarterback suggest, \"Maybe it's time to clean house.\"The win came despite the Steelers being outgained by more than 100 yards.But most importantly, the win took the Steelers from seemingly on the brink to in the driver's seat in the AFC North with four weeks to play. Tomlin has famously -- or infamously -- never had a losing record, and games like this one are why. The Steelers are 7-6, the win having stopped a two-game losing streak.\"Awesome team win,\" Tomlin said. \"I'm just appreciative of the effort of the men in that locker room. It's classic Steelers vs. Ravens. ... [I] appreciate the efforts. Big win for us, obviously, in a hostile environment, and we'll keep moving.\"\nThey certainly will keep it moving; they have no other choice. The Steelers lead the Ravens by one game and, crucially, have the head-to-head tiebreaker. They also know all too well how quickly things can slip the other way. Last year, the Steelers blew a two-game AFC North lead with four weeks to go.As we turn our attention to Week 15, the stage only gets brighter and the road to January, for many teams, officially begins now. Can they avoid a similar fate this year?\n        \n            \n                Ravens lose to Steelers in controversial finish, but have no one to blame but themselves as season nears brink\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCurrent AFC North standings, odds projectionsHere's how the Steelers and Ravens measure up in the AFC North, plus the top two tiebreakers if the teams end up with the same record.\nW-LTiebreaker 1:   Head-to-headTiebreaker 2:   Division W-L      1.

(The 4-9 Bengals have a 3% chance.)Furthermore, the Steelers are -185 to make the playoffs at DraftKings Sportsbook (+150 to miss); the Ravens are +185 to make the playoffs (-230 to miss). Those may seem like surprising numbers given it's only a one-game lead for Pittsburgh and there's still a head-to-head meeting remaining, but another reason for Pittsburgh's significant advantage is ...Remaining schedule for Steelers, RavensPittsburgh faces a significantly easier schedule to finish.Remaining schedule with opponent W-LSteelersRavensWeek 15vs. Dolphins (6-7)at Bengals (4-9)Week 16at Lions (8-5)vs. Patriots (11-2)Week 17at Browns (3-10)at Packers (9-3-1)Week 18vs. Ravens (6-7)at Steelers (7-6)The Ravens have the sixth-toughest schedule remaining (.606 opponent win percentage); the Steelers have the seventh-easiest (.442 opponent win percentage).Bet Steelers and Ravens games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins.How can the Ravens win the AFC North?Not all is lost yet for Baltimore, as 24% is not nothing. Here are the ways Baltimore can still win the AFC North:Win out.Beat Bengals, Steelers and one of Packers or Patriots; Steelers lose one of three other remaining games.Beat Bengals and Steelers, lose to Packers and Patriots; Steelers lose two of three other remaining games.Lose to Bengals, beat Packers, Patriots, Steelers; Steelers lose out.Beat Bengals, Packers, Patriots; Steelers lose next three games. (In this case, the Ravens would clinch the AFC North even before playing the Steelers in Week 18.)Lose to Bengals and one of Patriots/Packers, beat Steelers; Steelers lose two of three other remaining games; Bengals lose at least one more game.Beat Steelers and lose other three games; Steelers lose out; Bengals lose at least two more games.Needless to say, the Ravens are big Dolphins fans this weekend, followed by the Lions in Week 16 and the Browns in Week 17.Can either team claim a wild card bid?The short answer is it's extremely unlikely. The AFC Wild Card race currently features four teams with at least eight wins, meaning the Steelers' or Ravens' best chance, by far, is by winning the division.AFC wild card standingsW-L5. Bills9-46.

The team announced that Jones will miss the rest of the season. Jones was playing through a left fibula injury, but tore the Achilles in his right leg in the first quarter on Sunday during a pass attempt. While Jones was able to limp on his own to the locker room, the Colts were quick to rule him out.\nJones, 28, had been one of the NFL's most remarkable comeback stories this season as the Colts got off to a 7-1 start. However, they have lost four out of their last five, with Jones throwing five interceptions in that span.Who the Colts will move forward with at quarterback is a legitimate question. The rookie Riley Leonard replaced Jones under center on Sunday, and completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and one interception while adding a touchdown on the ground. Then there's Anthony Richardson, the former No. 4 overall pick who is currently on injured reserve after he suffered an orbital fracture during pregame warmups in mid-October. He lost the quarterback battle with Jones this preseason, and has an 8-7 record as starter for Indy.\nThe Colts were once viewed as the best team in the NFL, but at 8-5, it's no longer a given that they will even make the playoffs. Indy gave up control of the AFC South with its loss to Jacksonville on Sunday, and have one of the toughest remaining schedules in the NFL:WeekOpponentWeek 15at Seattle SeahawksWeek 16vs. San Francisco 49ersWeek 17vs. Jacksonville JaguarsWeek 18at Houston Texans\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A pivotal week awaits in the UEFA Women's Champions League, headlined by a matchup between OL Lyonnes and Manchester United that exemplifies the excitement of this season's competition.Lyon, the record eight-time winners of the competition, continue to demonstrate their title-winning credentials and are tied on points with first place Barcelona heading into the penultimate round of matches in the league phase. Their pedigree is in stark contrast to United, but the hosts are no slouch -- they have three wins in their opening four matches and look just about certain for a spot in the knockout rounds, and are in the mix for a top four finish that would send them straight to the quarterfinals.\"The women's side in Europe, the parity is insane,\" said NWSL champion and CBS Sports broadcaster Darian Jenkins. \"Manchester United, who you don't have much expectation for. It's the first time in this tournament and they're making history and we get to witness that and champion it and talk about it, I've loved that because that's how the game is going to continue to grow and keep pushing.\"Lyon are still Jenkins' pick to win the competition, their refresh under new majority owner Michele Kang and new manager Jonatan Giraldez so far providing the spark needed to potentially snap a four-year wait to lift Europe's top prize. Lily Yohannes remains one of the game's rising talents and is slowly working her way into a revamped version of Lyon, who are still getting the best out of players who are familiar to the club. Ada Hegerberg is one of the competition's leading goalscorers with three goals in four games so far, Giraldez, though, boasting enough depth that seven different goalscorers have delivered 11 goals to start the Champions League season.\nThis season's most fascinating storylines, though, have been reserved for the underdogs. United are not the only ones who have impressed Jenkins -- she is an admirer of Belgium's OH Leuven, who have gone unbeaten against the likes of Paris FC, Twente and Roma and are in the picture for a place in the knockout phase playoffs. They can underscore the point on Tuesday at Paris Saint-Germain, who have surprisingly lost all four games to start the Champions League season and could be eliminated from the competition before the final round of league phase matches.\"I'm loving Leuven. I love the underdog story,\" Jenkins said. They put up a fight against arguably the best team in the world [in a 3-0 loss to Barcelona on Matchday 3] so those are the kind of storylines that I fall in love with, even on the men's side,  the women's side. That's what kind of drives me forward.\"Barcelona, meanwhile, will return to the competition without Ballon d'Or Aitana Bonmati, who will miss much of the season after breaking her leg before the second leg of the UEFA Nations League final, which Spain won. The Liga F champions will be missing her midfield talents but Jenkins said the injury is unlikely to dim Barcelona's overall quality much.\n\"It's devastating speaking from a girl that's broken her leg,\" she said. \"It's a difficult injury to come back from. I think Barcelona's going to be fine. I'm not worried about Barcelona or Spain. I mean, this is a team that has an incredible youth to pro program [with] their younger players. It's just the nature of this sport -- injuries lead to opportunity for those that are on the bubble and I think you see players stepping up … They run deep. I mean, we even talked to Matchday 1 of Champions League. They had to sell off a lot of their players because the men's team was dealing with financial issues, like they always have been. They're doing just fine. They have academy players that are stepping [in], that are hungry, that want to make a statement, that want to be the next Aitana Bonmati, that want to be the next Alexia Putellas so i'm not worried about Barca. I would still be terrified to play that team.\"Men's, Women's Champions League shows to convergeMatchday 5 of the Women's Champions League will run concurrently with Matchday 6 of the men's competition, with CBS Sports providing coverage of both in a unique combination of the studio shows. Plans include a joint edition of the Golazo Show, providing a one-of-a-kind platform for the women's game.\"I know that we'll be blending both and I think what's exciting, too is that it's a big opportunity to educate and showcase the incredible women athletes and these teams that have made such a rich history in women's football with the UCL crew, and a lot of the fans and engagement that don't really watch the women's side are going to be able to see the most elite teams play each other while the most elite men's teams are playing each other so It's just going to grow us so much more, which I'm here for,\" Jenkins said. \"That [was] my goal when I retired so I want to keep pushing the game forward and this is one of the biggest stages to do that's what I'm excited for and I expect a lot of fun chaos.\"\nMatchday 5 TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternTUESDAY, DEC. 9TIMEHOW TO WATCHChampions League Matchday12:30 p.m.Paramount+.

    "body": "\n        On January 1, 1902, Michigan and Stanford met in the Tournament East-West Game. The game, which Michigan won 49-0, was the first of its kind: a postseason invitational game between two schools that played in different leagues. In other words, it was a bowl game. It was the first of its kind, and also the last of its kind, until 1916, when the game became an annual event. It's now a tradition that has carried on for over 100 years. The Tournament East-West Game continues too. It changed its name to The Rose Bowl in 1923.Bowls have been around nearly as long as the sport of college football itself, but it seems their time is nearing an end. It wasn't long ago when players began opting out of bowl games to preserve their health and future value as athletes, but the first ones to do it were the players likely to be high draft picks. Then the mid-round players joined in.Now teams are doing it. Kansas State and Iowa State received $500,000 fines from the Big 12 for opting out of bowl games this year. Both teams felt that, in the wake of losing their coaches and transitioning to new leadership, they had better ways to spend their time than preparing for a bowl game with a makeshift coaching staff and a roster full of players uncertain about what their futures held for them at the college level.Then Notre Dame joined in on the fun. The Fighting Irish, caught up in their feelings over being left out of the College Football Playoff, made the decision to end their season altogether. They took on the posture of righteous indignation, but who among us hasn't been guilty of telling themselves anything they have to in order to justify their feelings?\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking all 41 college football bowl games for 2025-26: Cotton, Rose offer CFP buzz, Pinstripe spikes rest\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRegardless of the motivation or how anybody feels about it, what matters is the precedent set by the schools. The first player to opt out of a game let other players know it was OK to do so, and more followed suit. More programs will too.Now, to be clear, this won't become the norm. I don't think we'll see a bunch of bowl-eligible teams opting out in the coming years, at least not the 10-2 ones. It will mostly be teams dealing with changes in leadership, but the more teams that skip out on bowls, the more we'll realize how little the bowls matter now. For many college football fans, bowls have always been part of the experience. Events as fundamental to the sport as bands playing fight songs, tailgates and rivalry trophies. But most of those traditions have been warped and chipped away at by the College Football Playoff. The desire to maximize revenue and create an enticing product has destroyed the conferences most of those same fans grew up with. Bowls are no different. The College Football Playoff has damaged the value of the bowl games more than players opting out of them ever could.\nBowls had already begun to lose some of their best available options to the playoff when it expanded to 12 teams. That's eight more teams they no longer got to choose from for their games. Tack on more schools opting out of games, and the pool of available teams becomes even thinner, which makes the games less attractive as television properties, which makes people sitting in boardrooms begin wondering if there are better ways to fill those blocs of television.Maybe they can put on a rankings show instead? It'll be great. They can rank teams in any order they choose and then come up with arbitrary reasons why they did so. Then, later in the show, they can just change them. Think of the engagement it could get on social media!Anyway, a further threat to the bowls is the unending specter of further playoff expansion. Nobody believes the playoff will remain at 12 teams, and the \"controversy\" around this year's playoff field will only lead to louder cries for expansion. Because if there's anything we've learned about college football's postseason, it's that putting more teams in the playoff fixes all the problems. Once they take that bad boy to 16 teams, that's four fewer teams available. And that's assuming they stop at 16. Let's not forget there have been 24-team proposals floated in recent months, too.\nWhen the playoff does expand, how many of its new games will be played at neutral sites? You think the teams that earn byes in the current format don't look at the teams who get to host first-round playoff games and think about how nice it would be to have that money too? The future of the College Football Playoff doesn't include more teams, but more games played on campus, too, because everybody will want a taste of the action. This is a good thing. Playoff games on campus make for an incredible environment, and incredible environments make for awesome television.But it won't be nearly as awesome for the bowls. At least, not the ones who aren't part of the rotation as host sites in the later rounds of the new playoff. So, if you're a fan of bowl games, enjoy them while you can. They won't be around too much longer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Champions League's Christmas break right around the corner, this week's round of fixtures have a critical feel for some of Europe's biggest sides. A dramatic and surprising round of results last month has Manchester City on the outside of the top eight before a critical trip to Real Madrid with Liverpool and Barcelona running out of wiggle room before big games for them. The former travel to Inter for a game that would have drawn enough eyeballs in any circumstances but the furor around Mohamed Salah's future only adds to the pressure on Arne Slot.Hansi Flick probably doesn't feel the Barcelona fanbase breathing down his neck to the same extent but there will certainly be unwelcome questions for him if Eintracht Frankfurt upset the Spanish champions at the Camp Nou. Without any further ado, let's dive straight into those questions below:1. Inter vs. Liverpool: Is Szoboszlai the man to step in for Salah?A problem position in the Liverpool side this season can only mean one thing, get Dominik Szoboszlai in there. In true Trent Alexander-Arnold fashion, the Hungarian found a way to be the most impactful player on the pitch from full back during his sojourn there earlier in the season. When the rest of the midfield was faltering, the No.8 entered the fray. And now that Salah's mixed zone performance has made himself even more unpickable than his on field displays, it looks like Szoboszlai is going to have be the man for the right flank.In the three games he has started in the position, Szoboszlai has proven impressive enough. In the 1-1 draw with Sunderland no one made more progressive carries while he and Florian Wirtz led the team in shots. In the 3-3 draw with Leeds Szoboszlai's performances took another step up, four chances created and what looked to be the winner only for the hosts to stun the champions at the death. You'd hardly confuse his output with prime Salah but for a stop-gap option 0.4 expected goals plus expected assists per 90 Premier League minutes is not to be sniffed at.\n\n        \n            \n                Mohamed Salah doesn't travel with Liverpool for Champions League; Saudi clubs' interest in January move soars\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAll the more encouraging is how his presence has brought a slight upswing in form out of Wirtz, who might still be hunting that first Premier League goal but is getting ever closer in recent weeks. When Salah is in the team there is a risk that his need to get up close with the striker forces Wirtz to drop deeper and wider so that he can create with others. With a more natural midfielder out to his right, he can cut out a bit of the ball progression duty he brought on himself and work on dovetailing with the center forward. It hasn't always worked -- the 22 year old was too much like his old self against Leeds -- but even in the positions he takes up, you can see the vision for how Wirtz, who Liverpool need to be a success, can excel with Szoboszlai at his side.So if moving Szoboszlai to the right is giving passable output for a Salah-less Liverpool and could get the best out of Wirtz, why is there even a question to ask here? Partly because a front four with a repurposed attacking midfielder on one flank and whoever replaces Cody Gakpo on the other likely lacks enough of the stretch in behind factor that Liverpool need (though this is partially true with an ageing Salah in the XI too). More so, however, it is that any move that lessens Szoboszlai's involvement in the game is a bad one for Arne Slot.In his three games on the right, the 25-year-old has averaged 72 touches per 90 minutes. Put him in midfield and that number swings up to just shy of 85. He uses them well and no wonder. Most teams are better when their best player touches the ball more. So far this season there is no more valuable player for Liverpool than Szosbozlai and when the need for results is as pressing as it is for this team right now, getting him on the ball might have to take priority over almost everything else, even Wirtz's development.\n2. Real Madrid vs. Manchester City: Has Donnarumma been good enough?Sixteen games, 15 conceded, seven clean sheets, a record of 12 wins, two draws and two defeats: the headline numbers would suggest that there is not really a great deal to say about Gianluigi Donnarumma. Dig a little deeper too and there is no sense of a great crisis. In the Premier League he saves a shade below 65% of the shots he faces and based on the xG value of the shots he has faced, he has conceded 0.1 more goals than he ought to have. Take a look at the graphic below and there's a smattering of high xG shots in the center of the goal that have been saved. Those that have gone in are either close range looks or are hit down into the corners.Shots faced by Gianluigi Donnarumma in all competitions for Manchester City, sized by xG value. Shots in green are goals, blue are saved, grey are cleared by a team mate, purple struck the frame of the goal and red are off target. \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            In short, Donnarumma is batting at about average as a shot stopper. And of course the sample size for his performances is still very small. Goalkeeper xG, goals prevented and the like are notoriously variable even over the course of a season, let alone a few months. Sometimes you have a run of games where Samuel Chukwueze is hitting them perfectly, where the ball keeps breaking to an opponent at close range and where you feel a little wobbly under crosses. There's no reason to worry about Donnarumma just yet, that's for sure.Equally there is nothing yet that suggests the volte face City took in terms of their goalkeeping profiles is paying off just yet. Dumping Ederson and recruiting both James Trafford and latterly Donnarumma spoke to a team that was prepared to sacrifice possession control for shot-stopping. There is no doubt the control is largely gone, City average barely 60% possession this season where two years ago that number was five points higher, and at the very base of the team they are lacking in distribution. It isn't just that Ederson was an 85% passer and Donnarumma is 75%, it was apparent in the wobbles against Leeds and Fulham that City were missing a goalkeeper who they could dump possession with, safe in the knowledge that no one was going to press him.\nThat trade off would make total sense if the return was something like the Donnarumma of last season, the best pure shot stopper in the game. Maybe they will get that when they need it, like on the days when they rock up to Kylian Mbappe's house. If they don't, however, then the current version of their first-choice keeper might not be enough to mitigate for Man City's troubles elsewhere.3. Barcelona vs. Eintracht Frankfurt: Could Yamal excel centrally?At a mere 18 years of age, Lamine Yamal has basically completed winger-ing. If he isn't world football's most devastating force off the right flank then he is not far off. It seems like it has been years now where it has been so easy for Yamal to manufacture crossing and shooting opportunities for himself that he's had to artificially raise his own difficulty level with his outside of the boot deliveries and devilish dribbling through opponents.Fortuitously for Yamal, an injury crisis among his team mates offered him a chance to test himself in even more prime locations on Sunday. A late knock for Raphinha, Fermin Lopez's limited availability post-injury and Dani Olmo's injury issues meant someone had to take the spot behind Robert Lewandowski. That task would fall to Yamal, who played the role as if he'd been doing it every day of his brief life.\nOn the flanks Yamal has license to gamble with possession, to risk losing the ball in order to force the issue and get the ball into dangerous spots. Such cavalier play in central areas can be altogether more damaging so this time out the youngster was more reserved in his passing, completing each of his first 34 passes, the first of a mere three giveaways from 47 attempts coming well after the hour. Among those passes was a perfectly placed through ball from which Roony Bardghji ought to have delivered an assist for Yamal to go alongside the penalty he scored. Still, it wasn't Yamal's final third output that won praise from Hansi Flick -- that can be taken for given -- but moments like that which led up to the Bardghji chance, Barcelona's No.10 gliding in to steal possession and start an attack up field.\"We asked him if he would like to play as a '10' and he said yes,\" said Flick. \"Everything I saw of Lamine tonight was good. The connection with Roony. The most important thing was his defensive contribution. It was incredible.\" The numbers certainly leap off the page. Yamal hurled himself into 24 duels, a number that isn't just well over double any of his team mates but also more than a quarter of Barcelona's total. Three tackles, seven ball recoveries, possession won six times in the middle third: these aren't just the numbers of an energetic cameo in an unfamiliar role. That's prime Mason Mount stuff.As such there's a pretty compelling case to be made for giving Yamal so more looks at the number 10 spot to go with his No.10 shirt. Eintracht Frankfurt would be an ideal test, the sort of you attack, we attack game where an industrious presser in advanced areas can make a huge difference. Yamal is already so far ahead of where any 18-year-old should be in his development out wide that he can afford to test himself elsewhere. If it doesn't work as well in future, no trouble. Yamal can simply go back to being one of the best attackers on the planet from his old haunts.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After an abbreviated stop in Hawaii, the 2026 PGA Tour schedule begins the West Coast Swing with The American Express 2026 beginning on Thursday at the Pete Dye Stadium Course in La Quinta, Calif. After skipping the one-week Hawaii Swing, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is set to make his 2026 debut as part of The American Express field. The four-time major winner hasn't played particularly well in this event, however, recording just one top-10 finish in five tries. Still, the 2026 American Express odds list Scheffler as the clear-cut +300 favorite (risk $100 to win $300). Ben Griffin, ranked No. 8 in the world, is next on the PGA odds board at +1900, with Robert MacIntyre at +2000 and Ludvig Aberg at +2200. Before locking in any 2026 American Express picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 American Express field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 American Express predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at The American Express 2026: Sam Burns, one of the favorites at +2500, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to avoid at La Quinta this week. Burns had some highlights in 2025, including finishing T7 at the Tour Championship after a strong playoff run. There were also some low points as well like going nine straight tournaments without a top-20 finish, including three straight missed cuts in that run. He has a pair of top-10 finishes at The American Express, but no top-5s, and he finished T29 last year, so the model doesn't like him as a top contender this week. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Matt Fitzpatrick a top-four contender this week even though he's tied for the eighth-lowest odds at +3000. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. This will be his debut at The American Express, but he finished 2025 strong with four top-10 finishes in his last six events. He finished the season 34th in Strokes Gained: Total and 30th in Strokes Gained: Putting, making him a golfer to target with slightly longer odds this week. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 American Express picksThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of +2700 or higher as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 American Express, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

In 15 games, he has completed 73% of his passes for 3,349 yards and 41 touchdowns with just six interceptions. He also has rushed 83 times for 284 yards and six scores. In the national semifinal win over the Oregon Ducks, he completed 17 of 20 passes for 177 yards and five touchdowns. Mendoza's elite accuracy makes Indiana's offense extremely tough to stop, but the Hoosiers are also incredibly strong on defense. Indiana finished the regular season ranked fourth nationally in total defense. Indiana has been just has stingy in the postseason, holding Ohio State, Alabama and Oregon to an average of just 11.6 points per game.  See which team to back at SportsLine.\nWhy Miami can cover Senior quarterback Carson Beck helps guide the Hurricanes. In 15 games, he has completed 73.3% of his passes for 3,581 yards and 29 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He has also rushed for a pair of touchdowns. In the national semifinal win over Ole Miss, he completed 23 of 37 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. The Miami ground attack is led by junior running back Mark Fletcher Jr. In 13 games this season, he has carried 199 times for 1,080 yards (5.4 average) and 10 touchdowns. Miami's defensive front could be an x-factor in this matchup. Defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. has been borderline unblockable at times as the likely top-10 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft has piled up four sacks in the CFP. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Indiana vs. Miami picksSportsLine's model is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

This year, IU is 5-0 ATS versus ranked opponents, with each of those five coming against top-10 teams. On the field, Indiana is peerless, ranking second in the nation in both scoring offense and scoring defense, despite having the ninth-hardest strength of schedule. Heisman winner, and Miami native, Fernando Mendoza has more touchdown passes (8) than incompletions (5) during Indiana's CFP run, and he plays on the most disciplined team in college football. No team has a better turnover differential than the Hoosiers, who also average the fifth-fewest penalties per game in the country. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Miami can cover In addition to having home-field advantage, Miami also has a spread edge with Carson Beck under center. He's both won and covered in nine straight versus ranked foes, while the Hurricanes are on a 7-0 ATS run against Top 25 teams. Miami has a pair of future first-round draft picks on its D-line as the Canes average the fourth-most sacks per game in FBS. That pass rush is a strength which plays into what's Indiana's biggest weakness. Mendoza has been under pressure recently as he's been sacked an average of 2.5 times over his last six games, following only going down 0.8 times over his first nine games. On the other hand, Beck should have plenty of time in the pocket as Miami allows the lowest pressure rate in the nation. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Indiana picksSeverance has analyzed Indiana vs. Miami and is leaning Under on the total.

He is headed for an MRI. \nIf Butler's season is over, Golden State's campaign would be as well. The Warriors were already going to have to go on a big second-half run to crawl above the play-in line, but without Butler, who was in the middle of a terrific season, there is no chance they can do anything in the playoffs, even if they were to somehow qualify. \nThe best-case scenario for Butler would be a hyperextension or MCL sprain. Perhaps that would give him a chance to return this season. Anything more than that would likely impact Golden State's trade deadline plans.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        At the onset of the year, I made a list of goals I want to accomplish in my own personal golf game. They have your run-of-the-mill hits, of course, like playing more rounds, making a hole-in-one and going on a buddies trip, but there are two actions items that have been seared into my brain the last few weeks because the way in which they run, counterintuitive to each other.You see, I want to lower my handicap to the lowest figure of my life. I want to play smarter golf. I want to shoot scores in the 60s and feel the rush of stringing together birdie after birdie. I want that plus sign next to my name again. But, the thing is, I still want to be able to hit shots while I accomplish this. I want to shape them. I want to flight them. I want to use the conditions to carve them. I want to play Golf with a capital G, even if this tightrope act may ultimately be one which results in a faceplant. It's just more fun that way, score be damned.You may read this and think, \"Well, yeah, you have to hit shots in order to play golf,\" but actually, I don't think you do. At least not the type of golf you have in mind. I'm talking about the type of golf that was on display at Waialae Country Club this past weekend at the Sony Open. \nMeasuring around 7,000 yards and playing to a par 70, the Seth Raynor design should be obsolete by now. The game should have passed it by, but yet it remains and is still one of players' favorites for what it requires out of them. It's not distance that they need but rather skill -- the ability to hit different shots out of different windows at different times while considering a whole myriad of factors.Now, that is timeless.\n        \n            \n                Chris Gotterup runs pulls away from field to win 2026 Sony Open, first tournament of PGA Tour season\n                \n                    Patrick McDonald                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhen trying to compare eras in different sports, a common refrain among those who side with recent or active players is that these guys become more athletic through general evolution, right? Technology has improved. Equipment and training aids have become more helpful. Data is being implemented in ways to drive decisions like never before. Players' eating habits are way better. They rarely consume alcohol and stick to the same meals that they know fuel them in the most effective manner. Workouts are getting more out of them, while recovery methods like cold plunges and red light therapy restore muscles and alleviate aches and pains in a blink of an eye.\nWhile not basketball or football players, golfers fall in this same boat. Equipment is a far cry from what it was at the start of the century as big mis-hits continue to be a thing of the past. Driving ranges are littered with Trackman and Foresight launch monitors as some players are beholden to their numbers like toddlers with a tablet in front of them.On the golf course, players and caddies know where to press their luck and can quantify how much more advantageous it may be to take, say, driver off the tee on a certain hole as opposed to laying back and playing for position.As such, many believe golfers have gotten better. I'm not here to say they haven't -- I mean, have you seen what Scottie Scheffler has done the last four years? Have you seen Rory McIlroy when he is firing on all cylinders? -- but I don't think all of them have. I think the bulk have just become more efficient.\nThey have gotten better at identifying the path of least resistance, taking it and attempting to put as few strokes as possible on their scorecard. That's the name of the game, after all, isn't it?This weekend in golf got me thinking about this. Over in Dubai, blustery conditions wreaked havoc on players in the second round to the point that 2019 Open champion Shane Lowry took to social media and expressed how much fun he had in them. He signed for a 3-under 68 and beat the field average by nearly six strokes.\"It was refreshing playing in those conditions today,\" Lowry wrote. \"Fun needing to shape shots and hitting 8 irons 130 yards.\"\nOn the other side of the the planet, something similar unfolded at the Sony Open. In what some believe to be the last trip the PGA Tour takes to Hawaii due to future scheduling changes, Waialae Country Club enjoyed one last hoorah. From Thursday afternoon through Saturday, players were forced to play golf with a capital G. If you weren't about it, you were on your flight back to the mainland on Friday.Nearly everything had to be accounted for on every shot -- varying wind directions depending on which way the hole ran, shot shapes and run outs and how they affected the total yardage, where the correct miss was. Golf may be played in an arena during the early portion of the week, but when it actually matters and real stakes are on the line, it is best that it remains an outdoor sport.\"On a driving range you're not normally hitting a lot of those shots,\" Jordan Spieth said. \"You're not hitting 5-iron from 160 and trying to like chip it. You just get a really good gauge on where things are at, and when you're doing it well it's really fun.\"\nIn a perfect world, this would be the case every week. Golfers required to play golf, required to do more than see the target, know the number and swing away. The juggling act in between the ears of deciding which variables to weigh and which to ignore is an integral part of the game. It's where the elite separate themselves even more.Instead, there are only a handful of instances each year in which the confluence of variables set the table in such a way. It's part golf course, part time of year and part luck. For the 2026 season, it happened to be served in the first week, and although the PGA Tour may be leaving Hawaii in the future, I hope the tournament was enough to remind them it doesn't need to leave the golf behind, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Detroit Lions intend to hire Drew Petzing to be their next offensive coordinator, sources tell Jonathan Jones of CBS Sports. Petzing spent the last three seasons in that role with the Arizona Cardinals, producing mixed results for their offense.Petzing, 38, has been coaching since he worked as a graduate assistant at Boston College from 2010-11. He's been in the NFL since he was hired by the Cleveland Browns to be a football operations intern in 2013.Following stints as an offensive assistant with the Minnesota Vikings and Cleveland Browns, Jonathan Gannon hired Petzing to be his offensive coordinator in 2023. In Petzing's first season with the team, Arizona averaged just 19.4 points per game, but that improved to 23.5 points per game in 2024. That was good for 12th in the NFL.This past season, the Cardinals' offense was plagued by injuries to key players like Kyler Murray, James Conner and Marvin Harrison Jr. As a result, Arizona ranked 23rd in the NFL at 20.9 points per game. The Cardinals' rushing attack ranked 31st in the NFL with just 93.1 yards per game, although the passing attack was far more potent at 232.6 yards per game, which was good enough for seventh overall.\nThose numbers may not inspire much confidence in Petzing as a playcaller, but he will have far more talent with which to work in Detroit. Between Jared Goff, Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jameson Williams and Sam LaPorta, the Lions are loaded at the offensive skill positions. Besides, this was a team that averaged 28.3 points in what was considered to be a down year.That talent didn't always click under former offensive coordinator John Morton, who was fired after just one year on the job. Following a relatively slow start for the Detroit offense, coach Dan Campbell took over playcalling duties in Week 10 and never relinquished them.\"It was just, let's try something a little different,\" Campbell said about the move in November. \"Look, I know what I want to do, I know how I want to do it. Now, that being said, this is a collaborative effort. I was taking input from John Morton that whole time, and the other coaches.\"\nPetzing will be tasked with pushing the Lions offense closer to the heights of the Ben Johnson era from 2022-24. If he can do that, Detroit should be poised for a bounce back campaign after missing out on the current postseason.\n            ",

Fortunately, it seems all is OK.\"Bill Self felt under the weather earlier today and, out of an abundance of caution, was taken to [Lawrence Memorial Hospital] Health where he received IV fluids. He is feeling better but did not accompany the team to Boulder,\" the release said.A source told CBS Sports that the acting coach for the game will be determined either late Monday night or early Tuesday morning. Jeremy Case is KU's associate head coach, while longtime assistant Kurtis Towsend has experience coaching in Self's stead. KU also recently brought on alum and veteran NBA assistant Jacque Vaughn. \nMonday's trip to the hospital was the latest health event for Self, who did not coach in the 2023 Big 12 and NCAA tournaments after having a heart procedure to insert two stents to alleviate blood flow. Self had a second significant hospital stay for heart treatment last summer. At Big 12 Media Day last October, a slimmed-down Self told CBS Sports, \"I feel better now than I have in a long time.\"It's been a bit of a bumpy season for Kansas. The Jayhawks are 13-5 and coming off an 80-62 home win Friday against Baylor, but that was just the ninth game out of 18 of which star freshman guard Darryn Peterson was available. Peterson's battled an annoying hamstring problem for the entire season. Not having Self for the Colorado game is the latest disruption for a program looking to bounce back after going 21-13 last year, its worst campaign in Self's 23-year tenure.\nBarring any setbacks, Self is expected to resume his coaching duties when the team returns for practice later in the week. KU plays Saturday at in-state rival Kansas State.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Indiana Hoosiers are the 2025 College Football Playoff national champions, winning their first-ever national title by beating the Miami Hurricanes 27-21 in an absolute thriller in Miami. It was one of the best national championship games in history -- going back to 1998 when the BCS was first introduced. Fittingly it was Fernando Mendoza, Indiana's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, who authored the iconic moment of the game with a touchdown run on fourth-and-5 to put Indiana up 24-14 in the fourth quarter. \nMendoza diving into the end zone feels like it'll be turned into a statue one day in Bloomington, Indiana, and it's a play that will end up on College Football Playoff highlight reels for decades. It's not often you watch a play live and know it's an all-timer, but that was the feeling for many watching Mendoza bulldoze his way into the end zone for what ended up the game-winner. That got us to thinking where it ranks among the all-time great national title game plays (since the start of the BCS era in 1998). \n1. Vince Young's TD run in the Rose Bowl (2005)The most iconic play in title game history in what is widely considered the best national championship showdown in history. Texas' Vince Young scampering into the corner of the end zone on fourth-and-5 against USC in the Rose Bowl will be incredibly hard to ever top. It wasn't just a fourth down run, it came with under 30 seconds to play and the Longhorns trailing by five. They couldn't have anything less than a TD and he delivered Texas the title. \n2. Tua Tagovailoa to Devonta Smith in OT (2017)Alabama's stunning comeback win in 2017 over Georgia after changing quarterbacks at halftime and turning things over to Tua Tagovailoa culminated in a walk-off touchdown in overtime, as Tagovailoa hit DeVonta Smith on second-and-26 in the corner of the end zone to take down Georgia. An overtime walkoff is special, much less a deep ball in overtime after a catastrophic start to lose 16 yards. I think this one and Young are pretty unassailable at No. 1 and No. 2. 3. Kelvin Benjamin's game-winning catch (2013)Another near walk-off winner: Jameis Winston lobbed a pass to Kelvin Benjamin in the end zone against Auburn, trailing 31-27 with under 20 seconds to play, giving Florida State its first national title in more than a decade. It wasn't quite as dramatic as Vince Young's run or Tua Tagovailoa's pass to DeVonta Smith, and it's somewhat underrated as a college football moment. But the effort from Winston to get the throw off and Benjamin to pull it down in traffic with the title on the line was all-time.\n4. Fernando Mendoza's fourth-down run (2025)Perhaps it's recency bias, but this run is likely to have a lot of staying power. It wasn't a walk-off touchdown, and the Hoosiers did have a three-point lead, but Mendoza's individual effort was remarkable. His cutback and leap over a lineman to gain the first down were incredible on their own, and then he absorbed a hit, stayed upright, and dove into the end zone for what became the game-winning touchdown. It may not rank alongside the top two plays because it didn't completely slam the door, but it belongs high on the list.5. Hunter Renfrow's TD catch to beat Alabama (2016)This was an iconic game, but the game-winning play itself wasn't quite as spectacular as the ones above it. That's not to take away from the moment for Clemson -- knocking off Alabama to win its first national title in more than 30 years on a game-winner with one second left is still unbelievable. That said, a well-executed rub route to free Hunter Renfrow in the flat doesn't quite have the same cachet as the plays above it.\n6. Tim Tebow jump pass (2008)Like the Mendoza run, this wasn't a walk-off in the final minute, but it was the knockout blow late in the fourth quarter in Florida's win over Oklahoma. The jump pass became synonymous with Tebow and Florida fans would probably argue this is too low. \n7. Kenyan Drake kickoff return TD (2015)Alabama and Clemson delivered some absolute classics, and this play gets a bit lost in the wash. With Clemson cutting the deficit to four, Drake ripped off an incredible 95-yard kickoff return to push Bama back in front by two scores and help the Tide pick up another national championship. 8. Michael Dyer run (2010)Oregon fans are still mad about this one, but Dyer somehow staying up to set up Auburn's game-winning field goal in 2010 is one of the craziest plays we've ever seen. It not being a touchdown knocks it down the list some, but it's still one of the most memorable moments we've ever had in a title game. 9. Kelee Ringo pick-six (2021)Georgia finally knocked off Alabama thanks to Kelee Ringo's pick-six in 2021 that sealed the Bulldogs' victory and gave them the first of back-to-back national titles. The play was more cathartic than anything, as Georgia already led by eight, but with Alabama driving and considering the history of the matchup, it was an incredible cherry on top for the Bulldogs.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins found their new lead man, announcing Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley as their next head coach on Monday evening. Hafley was a popular name this cycle and ultimately landed in Miami.Hafley, who turns 47 in April, just wrapped up his second season as the Packers' defensive coordinator. His unit ranked No. 12 in total defense, allowing 311.8 yards per game, and No. 11 in scoring defense, allowing 21.2 points per game. The Packers were eliminated in the wild card round last week after blowing the largest lead (18 points) in postseason franchise history to rival Chicago Bears.Hafley is well-traveled and experienced. He last served as the head coach at Boston College for four seasons, going 22-26 before leaving for the Packers. Before his time at Boston College, he spent a season as Ohio State's co-defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach. The Buckeyes allowed 13.7 points per game and 259.7 yards per game that season, which ranked the fewest in the FBS. Hafley also coached defensive backs with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers, as well as at the college level at Pittsburgh and Rutgers.Miami viewed Hafley as a favorite, as the Dolphins recently hired former Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan to serve as their new general manager. Now, Sullivan brings in a familiar face to turn the franchise around.\nMiami turns to Hafley to replace Mike McDaniel, who the Dolphins fired after he registered a 33-35 record over four seasons. McDaniel posted winning records in each of his first two seasons with the Dolphins but went 15-19 over the last two years. He failed to win a single playoff game and went 4-17 against teams with winning records during his tenure.The Dolphins haven't won a postseason game since 2000, the longest active playoff win drought in the NFL. There is plenty to be figured out in South Beach this offseason, as star wide receiver Tyreek Hill is expected to be released and the Dolphins could be in the market for a new quarterback as well. The Dolphins benched Tua Tagovailoa for rookie Quinn Ewers after Tagovailoa threw a career-high 15 interceptions in 14 games. He signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension in 2024 and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026.Hafley a harbinger of a particular QB?Given Tagovailoa's contract, odds are he will be on Miami's roster in 2026. A post-June 1 release would result in a $67.4 million dead cap hit for the Dolphins in 2026, a $31.8 million dead cap hit in 2027, plus an $11 million salary cap increase in 2026. \nWhat the Dolphins could do is bring in \"competition\" to battle Tagovailoa -- similar to what the Indianapolis Colts did with Anthony Richardson last year by adding Daniel Jones. Interestingly enough, Hafley comes over from a team that currently has what may be the most intriguing quarterback on its roster this offseason.\nMalik Willis is set to be a free agent this offseason, and he has earned the right to at least battle for a starting job. After Jordan Love suffered a concussion in the Packers' Week 16 loss to the Bears, Willis stepped into the starting lineup the following week against the Baltimore Ravens. While Green Bay lost that game, 41-24, Willis' performance was remarkable.Malik Willis is set to be a free agent this offseason, and he's earned the right to at least battle for a starting job. After Jordan Love suffered a concussion in the Packers' Week 16 loss to the Bears, Willis was called upon to step into the starting lineup the following week against the Baltimore Ravens. While Green Bay did lose that game, 41-24, Willis' performance was remarkable. \nThe former third-round pick out of Liberty completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown and led the Packers in rushing with 60 yards and two more touchdowns. According to CBS Sports Research, Willis became the first quarterback ever to complete 85% of his passes while averaging 13 yards per attempt and rushing for 60 yards. His 13.7 yards per attempt were the most by a quarterback with 50 rushing yards in a game in the past 50 seasons.\n        \n            \n                Ranking the top 50 NFL free agents for 2026: Early look at the stars who could hit the market in March\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSince the Tennessee Titans traded him to the Packers in 2024, Willis has gone 2-1 as a starter in Green Bay while averaging 204 passing yards per game. He has thrown three touchdowns with zero interceptions in those starts and posted a 132.4 passer rating. After his performance against Baltimore, Packers coach Matt LaFleur even had to publicly \"pump the brakes\" on the Willis hype.With Willis looking for a new opportunity, and the former Packers vice president of player personnel taking over as the Dolphins' general manager -- who then brought over the former Packers defensive coordinator to serve as head coach -- the Dolphins suddenly become a team to watch as a potential Willis landing spot.\n            ",

ESPN's postgame coverage showed Miami running back Mark Fletcher Jr. taking a swing at Indiana defensive lineman Tyrique Tucker as the teams shook hands following the Hoosiers' 27-21 victory Monday night.The footage showed the two players exchanging words before Fletcher swung his right arm in Tucker's direction. A Miami assistant coach quickly stepped between them and pushed Fletcher away. It was unclear from the video whether the punch connected.\nThe altercation came moments after Indiana completed an undefeated season and won the first national championship in program history. The cause of the confrontation was not immediately known, and neither school commented publicly on the incident late Monday.Tucker, who recorded one tackle in the championship game, was among the 13 players who transferred from James Madison to Indiana after coach Curt Cignetti took over the program. That group helped spark a rapid turnaround for the Hoosiers, who went the FBS' losingest team to national champions just two seasons after hiring Cignetti.\nAdditional video from WPLG-TV in Miami showed a contrasting moment. In that clip, Fletcher was seen congratulating and hugging Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza amid the on-field celebrations. Fletcher and Mendoza are both from the Miami area.\nOn the field, Fletcher was one of Miami's most productive players in the championship game. The junior running back carried the ball 17 times for 112 yards and two touchdowns, including a 57-yard scoring run early in the second half that cut into Indiana's lead. Miami remained within one score late into the fourth quarter before the Hoosiers sealed the win with a late interception.Fletcher's performance capped a strong postseason run for the Hurricanes' offense. Over four playoff games, he rushed for 507 yards and accounted for three total touchdowns, serving as a key piece in Miami's path to the national title game.\nFletcher spoke with the media after the loss, but video of the incident didn't surface until after his interviews had concluded.\n            \n    ",

The Hoosiers were 100-1 to win the title going into the season, but they proved to be the nation's most dominant team all year, going 16-0 en route to the national title. Things will be much different for the Hoosiers coming into 2026, as there's no longer any question about their place as one of the nation's best programs. They are 7-1 in the lookahead odds for the 2026 national championship, trailing only Ohio State and Notre Dame -- co-favorites at 13/2. Texas (15/2) once again finds itself near the top of the odds sheet going into Arch Manning's second season, with Oregon (9-1) rounding out the top five with Dante Moore returning to Eugene. \nIn total, 10 teams have title odds inside 20-1, including Miami, which is 19-1 after falling painfully short of its first title in 25 years. Below you can find every team with odds of 100-1 or better to win the 2026 national championship. \nOdds via FanDuel SportsbookOhio State (13/2)Notre Dame (13/2)Indiana (7-1)Texas (15/2)Oregon (9-1)Georgia (11-1)LSU (14-1)Texas A&M (15-1)Texas Tech (16-1)Miami (FL) (19-1)Alabama (22-1)Oklahoma (27-1)USC (30-1)Michigan (40-1)Auburn (45-1)Ole Miss (45-1)Tennessee (60-1)Utah (60-1)Missouri (80-1)Florida (80-1)Penn State (80-1)Iowa (100-1)BYU (100-1)Clemson (100-1)Vanderbilt (100-1)Washington (100-1)SMU (100-1)\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nIU meets The U. Hoosiers and Hurricanes. One of college football's paupers versus one of its princes. Two programs from opposite ends of the college football spectrum collide on Monday night at Hard Rock Stadium in South Florida with the same goal: To win the national championship. After 100-plus years of football futility and just two years after going 3-9, the Indiana Hoosiers enter the College Football Playoff National Championship a perfect 15-0 and ranked No. 1 in the country. They can complete arguably the most unlikely turnaround in sports history with a victory on Monday.Meanwhile, the Miami Hurricanes (13-2) have been one of the sport's most visible programs of the past 50 years, winning five national championships, but haven't lifted the trophy since 2001. Less than seven weeks ago, they were uncertain to even get into the 12-team CFP field; now they will play for the title in their home stadium.To earn its return to glory, Miami's hometown team will have to knock off a son from South Florida. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza attended high school about five miles from the University of Miami campus and was a face-painted Hurricanes fan growing up but did not receive a scholarship offer from the school. After spending his first three years at Cal, he transferred to Indiana prior to this season and had a storybook year: throwing for 3,349 yards and 41 touchdowns and winning the Heisman Trophy.The Hoosiers are 8.5-point favorites over the Hurricanes on Monday.While Indiana vs. Miami in the CFP National Championship is the marquee attraction on MLK Jr. Day, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes nine NBA games and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Jan. 19. All times Eastern.College football best bets, where to watchCFP National Championship: No. 1 Indiana vs. No. 10 MiamiTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Miami Gardens, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Miami +270 | Expert: Miami +8.5 (Matt Severance)\nBehind Mendoza's pinpoint accuracy and an air-tight defense, the Hoosiers have steamrolled opponents all season, winning by 31.5 points per game. Neither of Indiana's two playoff wins (38-3 over Alabama and 56-22 over Oregon) has been close. But on Monday the Hoosiers will face arguably the best defense they've seen this season. Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor are twin terrors off the edge and key a unit that allows just 14.0 points per game, which is fifth in the country. \"Miami's defense is so good, and Indiana's equally so, that there may not be 20 total points scored,\" Severance says. \"So heck yeah I'm taking 8.5.\" Meanwhile the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times, says the Hurricanes have a 36.0% chance to win and assigns a B grade to the Miami money line (+270).NBA best bets, where to watchMavericks at KnicksTime: 5 p.m. | Location: New York City | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Knicks -10.5\nStart spreading the news: There's something amiss about the Knicks. Just one month after winning the NBA Cup and looking like potential NBA Finals contenders, New York is just 2-8 over its last 10 games. The team has dropped to third place in the Eastern Conference and is just two games ahead of the 76ers for the sixth and final automatic-qualifying spot for the playoffs. In addition, star Jalen Brunson is questionable to play on Monday with a sprained right ankle. The good news for the Knicks is that they have one of the best home records (16-5) in the NBA, and the Mavericks have one of the worst road records (4-14). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 67.0% chance New York covers and gives a B grade to Knicks -10.5.Celtics at PistonsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Celtics +3.5\nThe top two teams in the Eastern Conference standings square off when the Detroit Pistons host the Boston Celtics at Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons (30-10) have won five of their last six games and own the best record in the East, 4½ games better than the Celtics (26-15), who have won seven of their last 10. The teams already have met three times this season with Detroit winning two of the meetings. But Boston's Jaylen Brown is coming off one of his best games of the season: 41 points and six rebounds in a 132-106 win over the Hawks. He's now averaging 29.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 4.8 assists a game. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Celtics have a 52.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Boston +3.5. College basketball best bets, where to watchProvidence at MarquetteTime: 6 p.m. | Location: Milwaukee | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 165.5\nTwo teams struggling in Big East conference play will try to turn their seasons around when the Providence Friars and Marquette Golden Eagles square off at the Fiserv Forum. Providence (9-9, 2-5 in Big East) is coming off a 93-88 win over Creighton but is tied for eighth in the 11-team Big East. Meanwhile, Marquette (6-13, 1-7) sits at the bottom of the conference. The Friars and Golden Eagles rank last and dead last, respectively, in the Big East in scoring defense, which may be the reason why the total sits at 165.5. But the SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 78.8% chance the teams combine for 165 points or fewer and gives a B grade to Under 165.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami came up just short in the College Football Playoff National Championship, but that doesn't take anything away from the Hurricanes' magical run through the CFP in 2025-26. Mario Cristobal led the program to its best season in 24 years, including three program-changing postseason wins that can serve as proof of concept for his plans for the future. Coaches said this week that Miami is a year ahead of schedule in Cristobal's fourth season, which raises the obvious question: What does 2026 look like? The roster remains loaded even with several projected departures, and the Hurricanes are poised to make another splash with Duke quarterback Darian Mensah expected to sign at any moment.Miami may already boasts the ACC's most expensive roster, and that investment paid off in 2025. The Hurricanes' postseason run netted the program at least $20 million in College Football Playoff payouts. An early-season home loss to Louisville and an overtime setback at SMU -- Miami's first game outside Florida -- could have derailed the year. Instead, the Hurricanes rallied to win four straight games, slipped into the CFP as the final at-large team and validated the idea that strong late-season play deserves weight in the selection process. That path could influence committee thinking in 2026 and beyond.Miami is positioned to return perhaps the most talented roster in the ACC next season, but significant holes must be filled. Quarterback Carson Beck is headed to the NFL, while defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. and right tackle Francis Mauigoa are projected first-round picks. That turnover comes with success for a program that had a school-record 19 players earn all-conference honors.\nIs it playoff-or-bust again for Cristobal?It starts in the trenchesMiami won't just be replacing its quarterback and top pass rusher. The Hurricanes must also rebuild an offensive line that could lose as many as four starters. That unit started the same five players in every game this season -- one of only eight teams nationally with that level of continuity.The veteran group allowed just 51 negative plays entering the postseason, the fourth-best mark in the FBS. The departures of Mauigoa, center James Brockermeyer, left tackle Markel Bell and right guard Anez Cooper will be a major storyline this spring, even as most attention centers on the quarterback position.Cristobal prides himself on building from the inside out, and the former Miami offensive lineman has stayed true to that philosophy.\nThe Hurricanes may be strongest on the interior, with senior Matthew McCoy and junior Samson Okunlola set to return. Miami also signed five-star Jackson Cantwell, the nation's No. 2 offensive tackle in the 2026 class.Is Mensah the next playoff quarterback?Miami's pursuit of Duke quarterback Darian Mensah is the worst-kept secret of the portal cycle. He is expected to join the Hurricanes in the near future.Cristobal and offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson have taken a Moneyball-like approach in recent offseasons, targeting players with comparable production rather than identical skill sets. That philosophy guided Miami's aggressive pursuit of Beck a year ago after he left Georgia. While Beck didn't offer the rushing element of former quarterback Cam Ward, his passing efficiency and yardage profile aligned with what Miami needed.\nMensah fits Dawson's vision, blending finesse with power. The ACC Championship Game MVP threw for 3,973 yards and 34 touchdowns against just six interceptions last season and appears primed to thrive in South Florida.Miami is widening the talent gapMiami's transfer portal success draws headlines, but its high school recruiting may be even more significant.The Hurricanes signed the ACC's top class in December, landing 30 prospects and finishing No. 10 nationally, according to 247Sports. The gap between Miami and the rest of the league continues to grow. Miami's class totaled 280.45 points in the 247Sports composite -- 25.58 more than the ACC's second-ranked class. Combined with a 19.36-point margin in 2023, the trend is unmistakable.\nTwenty-one of Miami's 30 signees are blue-chip prospects. That haul includes three blue-chip offensive linemen, highlighted by Cantwell, and six blue-chip defensive backs.A tougher road in 2026Miami opened the season with a marquee win over Notre Dame, a head-to-head result that helped propel the Hurricanes into the CFP. Next season, Miami travels to Notre Dame on Nov. 7.That trip is part of a more demanding schedule that includes an expanded nine-game ACC slate, a road game at Clemson and a cross-country flight to Stanford. How the conference arranges those road trips could go a long way in determining whether Miami returns to the playoff conversation.\nFor Cristobal and the Hurricanes, the margin remains thin -- and the expectations are no longer theoretical.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Robert Saleh is returning to the main chair, finalizing a deal to become head coach of the Tennessee Titans, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Saleh, 46, spent the 2025 season in his second stint as defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers, managing an injured unit that nevertheless advanced to the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs.Titans brass spent Monday interviewing Saleh and Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy before selecting Saleh, who will get a second chance at helming an NFL franchise. He previously led the New York Jets to a 20-36 record over three-plus seasons, getting fired five games into the 2024 campaign.After going 4-12 in 2021, he guided the Jets to consecutive 7-10 seasons on the strength of a defense that finished fourth and 12th in the NFL in points allowed, respectively. In 2023, the Jets' season was quickly derailed by Aaron Rodgers' Achilles injury, sustained during the team's first offensive series of the season.Similar to his start with the Jets, Saleh is linking with a Titans team that has not had much success in recent years. The Titans finished 3-14 this season, last in the AFC South. Tennessee got an up-close and personal look at Saleh in a 37-24 loss to San Francisco on Dec. 14. The Titans do have several promising young players, though, specifically quarterback Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. It'll be up to Saleh and his staff to help Ward and the rest of the Titans' young core realize their potential in the years to come.\nTennessee is slated to have the fourth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft this April.Saleh is the fourth head coach to land a job during this cycle. John Harbaugh recently came to terms with the New York Giants after he was fired by the Baltimore Ravens. Former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski was hired by the Atlanta Falcons, where he will succeed Raheem Morris, who was fired after leading Atlanta to consecutive 8-9 campaigns. The Miami Dolphins hired former Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley on Monday afternoon after somewhat-surprisingly firing Mike McDaniel. With Saleh heading to Nashville, there are now six remaining head coaching vacancies. The Buffalo Bills' job opened up Monday morning after Sean McDermott was fired despite going 98-50 during his nine seasons as the team's coach. The Ravens, Browns, Las Vegas Raiders, Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals continue to conduct interviews as they look to fill their respective coaching vacancies in the coming weeks. \nAmong the notable head coaching candidates are Nagy, McDaniel, former Packers and Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiac, Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, Vikings defensive coordinator and former Dolphins coach Brian Flores, Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Rams pass game coordinator Nate Sheelhaase, former Giants coach Brian Daboll and Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady. \n            ",

With these types of  promotions, you generally need to place a bet of at least a certain  amount to receive a certain amount of bonus bets, but in this case, there is no condition of winning the initial bet, as is the case at some sportsbooks. These welcome promos are  considered to be geared towards beginners or smaller bettors, and they're a great way to maximize the winnings and satisfaction of the user's initial experience. These welcome promos are considered to be geared towards beginners or smaller bettors, and they're a great way to maximize the winnings and satisfaction of the user's initial experience. The FanDuel promo code, DraftKings promo code, Caesars promo code and bet365 bonus offer all follow this format.The BetMGM bonus code  follows the \"first bet offer\" style of promo. You can bet up to $1,500  on your first bet and get it back as bonus bets if you lose.The Fanatics Sportsbook promo code  has its own unique structure. Bet insurance is FanCash back if your wager loses, but instead of having the insurance only apply to your first  bet with the sportsbook, Fanatics gives you bet insurance in FanCash on one wager each day for 10 consecutive days after account creation, up to $200 in FanCash per day. That's up to $2,000 in total FanCash after 10 days.  How to sign up for Borgata Sportsbook and claim the promo (Note: Borgata Sportsbook is currently only available to users in the state of New Jersey.) Click the CLAIM BONUS button on this page and download the Borgata Sportsbook app or click hereSign up and register your accountDeposit at least $20 into your accountPlace your first wager of at least $20Receive $100 in bonus bets instantly How to place a bet on Borgata Sportsbook Betting on Borgata Sportsbook is a simple and straightforward process that resembles most other major sportsbooks. Simply select a bet that you want to wager on, and it'll instantly appear on your betslip where you can then enter the amount of money you want to wager.  Let's suppose I want to bet on Christopher Bell to win this weekend's NASCAR race at +1000 odds. If I choose to place Bell on my betslip, I'll then be given the opportunity to place my wager (In this case, a $10 bet would pay me $100 if Bell wins) and file my bet. The whole process is easy and, quite frankly, foolproof.  Additional promos and bonuses In addition to the welcome promo we've covered, Borgata Sportsbook also offers its existing users several offers and promotions. Best promos for existing users this weekNHL Hat Trick Jackpot: Opt in to the Hat Trick Jackpot promotion and place a $10+ anytime goal scorer bet, up to one eligible bet per game.

The app is optimized for mobile use, allowing bettors to place wagers quickly from anywhere and receive instant push notifications for score updates or bet results.The betting site, on the other hand, offers a more expansive view of available markets and is better suited for in-depth browsing, especially when managing multiple bets or exploring detailed statistics on a larger screen.In essence, the app prioritizes portability and speed, while the website offers a more spacious, desktop-friendly betting environment.   Borgata Sportsbook responsible gambling tools Borgata Sportsbook offers GameSense as a resource to its users, outlining ways to make sure gambling remains a fun activity while also offering help for those struggling with a gambling problem.

    "body": "\n        Available for Maryland users only, Crab Sports is fairly new to the sports betting market in the state, having obtained its license to operate in 2023. Though the website and app offer fewer features compared to national competitors, Crab Sports offers a local and homegrown experience for those in the state who prefer it. Claim your Crab Sports promo code here:Despite more limited betting and banking options compared to other sportsbooks, Crab Sports' introductory offer of a 100% first bet profit boost (up to $500) with promo code CBSSPORTS caters more to the smaller players looking to build their initial bankroll. The player can win up to a $500 profit if their first straight, parlay, or Same Game Parlay (SGP) wager hits. We'll analyze the top features of this sportsbook and why Maryland residents and visitors should be interested in playing on Crab Sports.Crab Sports promo code: CBSSPORTS for a 100% first bet profit boostUsing promo code CBSSPORTS, new users have the opportunity to double their winnings via a 100% profit boost up to $500. The new player on Crab Sports must wager a minimum of $25 and a maximum of $500 for this promotion. Regardless of the initial bet, the maximum winnings on this first wager is $500.

Sign up here:How does the Crab Sports promo compare to other sports betting app bonus offers?Crab Sports offers a competitive initial offer for Maryland residents, giving new users the chance to win up to $500 in cash with a successful first bet. Here's how their offer stacks up against the best sportsbook promos from around the industry.SportsbookBonus OfferPromo CodeCrab Sports100% profit boost on first bet up to $500CBSSPORTSDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your first bet winsNone requiredFanDuelBet $5, get $100 in bonus bets if your first bet winsNone requiredFanatics10 x $100 Bet Match in FanCash CBSFANBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet, Win or LoseCBS20Xbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365Types of welcome promosFanDuel and DraftKings offer bet and get offers where the customer must win the first wager to receive the bonus bets (which expire after seven days). bet365 offers a similar bet and get welcome bonus, but the player will receive their bonus bets regardless of the outcome of their initial wager.BetMGM's offer of a no sweat bet up to $1500 essentially gives the customer a do-over if their first bet loses. However, the no sweat bet is paid in bonus bets, so if that second bet hits, the player will not receive the stake, only the winnings.Crab Sports' introductory offer most resembles Caesars, where a 100% profit boost is available to new customers. The difference is that Caesars offers 20 100% profit boosts (with a max. stake of $25 each) while Crab Sports gives new users one chance to go big up to $500.How to sign up for Crab Sports and claim the promo codeThose looking to sign up for CrabSports and claim this offer can follow these outlined steps:1.   Click on the link in this article to begin the process.2.   Click the SIGNUP button to start registration.3.   Fill in your personal details including name, email, address, and date of birth.4.   The next screen will ask for your address and last four digits of your Social Security number.5.   When prompted on the third screen, enter Crab Sports promo code CBSSPORTS.6.   Configure 2 Factor Authentication.7.   Make your first deposit. You can use the various deposit methods including debit card, credit card, or bank transfer.8.   Place your first wager up to $500 to redeem your 100% profit boost. How to place a bet on Crab SportsPlacing a straight wager is relatively straightforward on Crab Sports, with the user needing to click on the sport, game, and market of their choosing before selecting the dollar amount and placing the bet. For parlays and round robins, tabs appear in the betting slip, making this process easy. For SGPs, it's a bit trickier compared to most other sportsbooks. A user must click on the game of choice, followed by the Same Game Parlay option, select multiple plays, and click Add to Betslip before placing the wager. Multiple SGPs are able to be combined into parlays. Get started now:Crab Sports promo and bonuses for existing usersLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports features promotions for existing users that can enhance the value of their bets. With both profit boosts and no sweat options, there is plenty for Maryland users to enjoy after the initial welcome bonus.Deposit matchesOccasionally, sportsbooks offer deposit matches in which the user must deposit a required amount or more before receiving additional funds via cash or bonus bets. Most sportsbooks will require the deposit + bonus amount to be wagered before requesting a withdrawal. For Crab Sports, after the first bet, all cash winnings may be withdrawn as any no sweat bets aren't considered cash.No Sweat Bet tokensUsers can apply a token where, if the selected bet loses, the player will get a refund in the form of a free bet, which is not redeemable for cash.Boosted OddsGenerally, two-leg Same Game Parlays are where the sportsbook will enhance the odds to make it more enticing to bettors.Profit boosts / SGP profit boostsLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports offers profit boosts for parlays and occasionally straight wagers. Some profit boosts incentivize adding more legs to the parlay for a greater boost.Crab Sports user experienceThe user experience at Crab Sports is friendly as the sportsbook relies on a simplistic design where the odds pop due to a different color scheme than the rest of the text. The menus are easy to follow and choosing a sport or game is no more difficult than at any other sportsbook. User InterfaceThe design of the site is appealing with several variations of blue mixed with a grey color scheme, with black, white, and blue text. I like that the odds pop on the site, with a larger font and navy-blue text against a grey background. While the design looks a bit antiquated compared to the national competition, I can't say that it's a deterrent by any means from playing on the site.Crab Sports Home Screen LayoutOn desktop, the home screen features rotating banners with promotions and top games for that night. Live betting is prominently featured in the center with the games from around the world currently in play. On the left side, Links, Popular, and All Sports give the user plenty of menu options, as does a bar with each sport's icon towards the top. The My Selections tab on the right is visible throughout so you can see which picks you have selected. Overall, Crab Sports provides a clean look and is easily navigable on computers.On mobile, the home screen shows the sport icons at the very top, followed by rotating banners, and the live games. The menus at the bottom include Home, A-Z Sports, an icon to view your selections, Live, and My Bets. Once again, a very clean design for users and easy to navigate for both new and experienced players.Sportsbook app design, speed, functionalitySimilar to the desktop site, the odds pop on the app with larger navy-blue text against a lighter background. The functionality works similarly to the desktop site and lag doesn't seem to be an issue in my testing. But it's hard to compare Crab Sports' app to the feature-rich national brands such as DraftKings and FanDuel.For players who know what they want to bet when coming to the site, Crab Sports provides a fine experience. But if you're looking to browse random odds and categories, you have to go game-by-game at Crab Sports vs. menu items showing all games on several other sites.Geolocation issues can be common on any sportsbook app, but in most cases, has not been a major complaint of Crab Sports customers thus far. Sign up here:Crab Sports app vs. desktop site (ratings as of February 16, 2026)App store ratings·   \tApple App Store (iOS): 4.2/5 stars (246 reviews)·   \tGoogle Play (Android): 3.7/5 stars (65 reviews)Variety of sports & betting markets on Crab SportsSportMarkets OfferedBaseballMoney lines, run lines, totals, props, futuresBasketballSpread, money lines, totals, props, futuresBoxingMoney lines, moneyline 3-way, method of victory, round betting, go the distanceCyclingWinner, futuresDartsMoney lines, match betting, legs, correct score, 180sEsportsMoney lines, spreads, totals, correct scoreFloorballMoney lines, spreads, totals, correct scoreFootball (American)Money lines, point spread, totals, props, futuresGolfFutures, head-to-heads, propsHockey (Ice)Money lines, point spread, totals, props, futuresHorse / EquestrianMoney lines, top finishesLacrosseMoney lines, point spread, totals, props, futuresMMA / Combat SportsMoney lines, futures, winning method, round totalsMotor RacingFutures, winner, props, specials, finishing positionRugbyMoney lines, point spread, totals, props, futuresSkiingMoney lines, top finishes, futuresSnooker / PoolMoney lines, top finishes, futuresSoccerMoney lines, Asian Handicap, goal spreads, totals, props, futuresTable TennisMoney lines, spreads, set betting, total points, correct scoreTennisMoney lines, set betting, correct score, total match games, futures, totalsVolleyballMoney lines, spreads, set betting, total points, correct scoreQuality of oddsIn terms of the standard money line, spread, and totals, Crab Sports is comparable to most other sportsbooks. When it comes to props, though, the selections are much fewer compared to the larger sportsbooks, which allow more customization as compared to just over/under a set yardage or hits total for example.The Same Game Parlay builder seems like a first-generation version of what we see on the likes of DraftKings, FanDuel, and Fanatics now and can be tedious. You must click on the builder before adding SGP picks, which is a feature of the past on most books. There have been customer reviews stating that live betting cashout offers don't compare favorably to most other sportsbooks, with early cashout offers seemingly lower than other books.Crab Sports key betting featuresCrab Sports offers many of the same betting features found in most apps, including:Early CashoutWhile its offers are not as financially friendly as some of the larger sportsbooks, Crab Sports does offer the ability for users to get out of eligible bets before their conclusion with a profit or loss.Live BettingCrab Sports gives Maryland users the opportunity to bet during just about any sporting event while in progress. Odds changes are easy to note with green and red arrows upon any line movement.SGP generationNot only can users create SGPs, they may parlay multiple SGPs, albeit each one must be created separately. For eligible games, a Same Game Parlay button appears which must be selected before options are chosen.How to track your bets on Crab SportsOn desktop, the My Selection tab on the right side of the page makes it easy to follow along with your bets. The My Bets tab allows you to view your existing wagers. On the app, the icon of a ticket in the center at the bottom makes it easy for players to make their selections. To track selections on the app, My Bets on the bottom right is the place to click.Crab Sports customer supportIn addition to comprehensive help, rules, and FAQ pages, users with an issue may email support@crabsports.com, with the response time usually within an hour or two. Crab Sports does not feature a live chat as most other sportsbooks offer.Crab Sports responsible gaming toolsAt the bottom of the page on both desktop and mobile, users can click on the Responsible Gambling section.The sections on that page's FAQ include:How to play responsiblyWhat is Problem Gambling?What support is available?What tools can you use to manage your gambling?Voluntary ExclusionUnderage GamblingLinks on the page for gambling help resources include:MD Gambling HelpMD Problem GamblingMD LotteryMaryland State Lottery & Gaming Control AgencyNational Council on Problem GamblingGamblers AnonymousGam-AnonInternational Center for Responsible Gaming988 Suicide & Crising Lifeline Crab Sports banking methodsCrab Sports offers a number of ways for customers to deposit and withdraw money.Deposit methodsThese deposit methods are available for most users.Quick deposit methodsFeesProcess timeMin. depositOnline Banking (via Plaid)$0Instant$10Debit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Credit Card ((VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Withdrawal methodsHere are the primary ways to withdraw money at Crab Sports.Withdrawal optionProcess TimeMax withdrawalOnline Banking (via Plaid)1-2 business daysUnknownDebit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)1-2 business daysUnknownCrab Sports review: Final verdictFor Maryland users, Crab Sports is a fine alternative to the national sportsbooks. The design is simplistic but the interface is easy to use. If you're looking for the bells and whistles of additional menus, a search function, and more individual player betting options, then this isn't the right sportsbook for you. But if you're located in the state and want to take advantage of the generous signup offer, Crab Sports is worth a long look.The app works well and betting pregame or during the live action is easy. Betting SGPs is slower than at other sportsbooks, but at least it is still possible. There are limited options for deposits / withdrawals and the customer support is only via email. This sportsbook does not offer a rewards program as of now. Nonetheless, I recommend giving Crab Sports a shot if you're in Maryland.Honest feedback for how Crab Sports can improveEnhance Same Game Parlay betting: Compared to other sportsbooks, betting SGPs is slow. Clicking on multiple lines / props from the same game should automatically trigger an SGP, whereas now it only works if you press a specific button.Offer more menus for betting selected markets: Similar to BetMGM who also falls short in this category, Crab Sports should create menus so users don't have to click on each game separately to add a certain market.More deposit and withdrawal options: It seems almost standard that options such as PayPal and Venmo, which allow seamless money transfers, should be allowed at every sportsbook. This is a necessary addition in due time for Crab Sports.Crab Sports FAQHow do you get the Crab Sports promo?Use promo code CBSSPORTS on the third page of the registration screen and deposit up to $500 to receive a 100% profit boost on your first wager.How long do Crab Sports withdrawals take?Generally 1-2 business days, if not faster for withdrawals via debit card and online banking.Can you cash out bonus bets on Crab Sports?No, all bonus bets must be played through before attempting to redeem them for cash.How do you contact Crab Sports?Email support@crabsports.com with any questions or inquiries.Do you need a promo code for Crab Sports?Yes, use promo code CBSSPORTS when initially signing up.Does Crab Sports have a good rewards program?To date, there has been no mention of a rewards program for Crab Sports.Where is Crab Sports available?You may only play on Crab Sports if you're physically located in Maryland and are 21 years of age or older.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        PEORIA, Ariz. —Nick Castellanos has no regrets about how his time in Philadelphia ended. The newly acquired Padre, signed after his release from the Phillies earlier this week, said he took lessons from the rocky finish.But regret? There's none of that. \"In the moment, I felt how I felt, and I spoke from the heart, and I was honest in every word that I said,\" Castellanos said early Sunday afternoon from the Peoria Sports Complex, San Diego's spring training facility. \"It's not like I was outwardly ever displaying that. I kept it all inside. But when I was asked a question, I shot straight, and then people perceived it how they wanted.\" Perception always trailed Castellanos in Philly, making him a polarizing figure across his four seasons with the Phillies. But the dugout incident in June, reported by The Athletic, when he brought a beer into the dugout and screamed at manager Rob Thomson and hitting coach Kevin Long, didn't earn him much support.That, Castellanos admitted, he wished he handled differently.\"I said I will learn from this,\" Castellanos said. I let the emotions get the best of me in the moment. [Going forward] possibly if I see things that frustrate me or I don't believe are conducive to winning. [It's about ] not letting things just pile up over time so when I address it, it's less emotional.\" \nCastellanos joins an emotional clubhouse. Manny Machado, a friend from their childhood days, is viewed as the leader of the club. Some around the game see that fact as part of the reason why San DIego has yet to reach its potential. Whether Castellanos will only add fuel to what is already a combustible clubhouse will be something to monitor this season.Nonetheless, after vetting Castellanos' sour ending in Philly, A.J. Preller, the Padres' president of baseball operations, decided to take a chance on the veteran. \"We did a lot of homework,\" Preller said. \"Throughout the whole offseason, there was a lot of talk that the Phillies were looking to move him. We talked to a ton of people that have history with Nick. Teammates, coaches, people who have been around him.\" \nSan Diego made Castellanos' role clear, indicating he will DH and play some outfield and possibly first base, a position he has never played in his big league career. With the Padres' outfield set by Fernando Tatis Jr. in right, the position Castellanos is most accustomed to, his playing time in the field could be limited. Still, San Diego is paying only the league minimum of his $20 million salary in hopes he can rediscover the bat that eluded him at times with his former club.Machado is confident that Castellanos will produce. \"For me as a player, seeing it from this side of it, I see a guy who's accomplished a lot,\" added Machado. \"I really don't know the details of what happened over there. Don't really care, honestly. I'm just happy we got him for what we got him for, and he's going to improve our team tremendously.\" San Diego is in an unusual position. The club is in the middle of a sale, and its finances have been reshaped by the collapse of its regional sports network model. Preller, known for handing out hefty deals, was uncharacteristically quiet this offseason with the future of ownership in flux. On the field, you could argue the Padres might have missed their window to win a World Series. Machado will turn 34 in July. Xander Bogaerts turned 33 in October. After presuming that San Diego would be Fernando Tatis' longterm home, a trade down the line isn't out of the question. \nTheir rotation this year, too, leaves a lot to be desired headlined by Nick Pivetta, Michael King, and Joe Musgrove. Spring training will determine the final two spots. Castellanos, however, has his sights set on this season. He spoke about needing a fresh start and how he sensed Game 4 of the NLDS would likely be his last game as a Phillie. He long came to terms with that and with some of the decisions he made during the year.He wants to contribute. He believes he can still do so -- even as he enters his age-34 season coming off of a down one (.250/.294/.400 slash line in 547 at-bats).\nHe does have just one regret overall about his previous stop, though. \"That we didn't win a World Series,\" he said. \"I think winning solves everything. So I think the one thing that I wish would have ended up different is that we would have won.\" He'll now try to change that outcome in San Diego.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Efe Ajagba signed with Zuffa Boxing after a frustrating draw against Martin Bakole that many observers believed Ajagba deserved to win. On Sunday, Ajagba made good on a new opportunity with new promoters, finishing former IBF heavyweight champion Charles Martin with a fourth-round TKO.Martin controlled much of the action through the first three rounds, moving around the perimeter of the ring and forcing Ajagba to come to him. Ajagba didn't utilize a jab while trying to close distance, allowing Martin to land counters and avoid the predictable right hands from Ajagba.For all of Martin's success, heavyweight is a division where things can change in an instant, and that's exactly what happened in Round 3. With Martin moving along the ropes once again, Ajagba landed a heavy right hand that put Martin on the canvas. Martin beat the count and survived the round, but was right back down in the opening 30 seconds of the fourth round, again from a right hand.Ajagba remained patient, hunting down Martin and continuing to land flurries of big shots until the referee was forced to jump in and halt the bout at the 1:11 mark of Round 4.\nZuffa Boxing's heavyweight division is very much still in development, but Ajagba entered the fight on the fringes of the top 10 in the world, and a big knockout win over a former world champion cements him as a man who will likely be competing for Zuffa's heavyweight title in the future.Let's take a look at what else happened at Zuffa Boxing 03.Umar Dzambekov def. Ahmed Elbiali via KO, Round 2Dzambekov dominated a fight that was expected to be one of the best of the night. In the opening frame, Dzambekov was able to work a pinpoint jab and straight, often dipping down to the body with his shots. It was clear from the early moments that the skill differential was massive and that Elbiali's only chance was likely to land a single, fight-changing shot.Unfortunately for Elbiali, that big shot came from Dzambekov. As Elbiali attempted to move forward through Dzambekov's shots, Dzambekov landed a crushing uppercut that sent Elbiali's eyes rolling up into his head as he crashed to the canvas. Elbiali's feet were twitching as the referee began his count, making it clear the fight was over in that moment.\nDzambekov looked like a man with all of the skills to be one of the major players on the still-developing Zuffa Boxing roster. And a fight with Radivoje Kalajdzic could be a huge one for Zuffa Boxing's light heavyweight division.\nJaybrio Pe Benito def. Abel Mejia via TKO, Round 3The main card got off to a wild start as Pe Benito scored a massive upset knockout of Mejia in the third round of their lightweight bout. The fight got off to a fast start with both men landing meaningful shots in toe-to-toe exchanges before things took a massive turn in the second round. As the two exchanged again, Pe Benito landed a short left hook that sent Mejia to the canvas.Mejia beat the referee's count and the bell sounded to end the round. Mejia was not given a chance to get back on track in the third round, as Pe Benito landed a crushing straight right hand that sent Mejia back to the canvas. Mejia again rose to his feet, but this time was unsteady and the referee was forced to halt the action less than a minute into the round.\nPe Benito was a big underdog at +500 but now owns one of the biggest knockouts in Zuffa Boxing's short history, though maybe not quite as thunderous as Dzambekov's uppercut one fight later.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas State fired fourth-year basketball coach Jerome Tang on Sunday, a source told CBS Sports. Athletic director Gene Taylor subsequently revealed late Sunday night he made the decision to fire Tang following K-State's loss at houston on Saturday. The move comes less than four days after Tang's postgame rant went viral following an embarrassing 91-62 home loss to Cincinnati on Thursday. a\"This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men's basketball program,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program's overall direction, have not aligned with K-State's standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.\"  The Wildcats are 10-15 and in the midst of their second-worst season in the past 20-plus years. Kansas State ranks 101st at KenPom.com and is 1-11 in the Big 12. The team is headed toward a second straight sub-.500 season despite being one of the bigger spenders in the transfer portal the past two offseasons. \nKansas State will attempt to fire Tang for cause. Tang has a buyout of more than $18 million, per the terms of his contract, but Taylor believes Tang's public criticisms of the players and the response that press conference spurred in the national media violated the terms of his contract.Tang released a statement disputing Kansas State's assessment of the program.\"I am deeply disappointed with the university's decision and strongly disagree with the characterization of my termination.  I have always acted with integrity and faithfully fulfilled my responsibilities as head coach,\" Tang said. \"I am grateful to the players, staff, and fans who make this program so special. I remain proud of what we built together and confident that I have always acted in the best interests of the university and our student-athletes.\"  Associate head coach Matthew Driscoll has been named interim head coach for the rest of the season. \nLISTEN: Matt Norlander breaks down Tang's final days at K-State on this emergency edition of the Eye on College Basketball podcast.Tang went 71-57 in less than four seasons on the job, including a 29-39 mark in the Big 12. He was hired in 2022 and an immediate success: He guided the Wildcats to the Elite Eight with a No. 3 seed and finished 26-10 thanks to the dynamic duo of point guard Markquis Nowell and forward Keyontae Johnson. Nowell's 19 assists in a Sweet 16 victory vs. Michigan State at Madison Square Garden set both an NCAA Tournament record and an optimistic tone for the Tang era, but it's been a litany of letdowns ever since.K-State is coming off a 78-64 loss at No. 3 Houston on Saturday. Tang had the players' names removed from the back of their jerseys for that game in a questionable move that followed his criticism of KSU players following the Wildcats' loss to the Bearcats.  \n\"This was embarrassing,\" Tang said Wednesday night at his press conference. \"These dudes do not deserve to wear this uniform. There will be very few of them in it next year. I'm embarrassed for the university, I'm embarrassed for our fans, our student section. It is just ridiculous.\"That's the quote that has Tang's legal team and Kansas State's lawyers set to battle in the weeks ahead. If K-State wins, it won't pay Tang another dime. If it loses, Tang will have more than $18.5 million coming his way. There is also the realistic possibility that the parties wind up settling somewhere in the wide gulf between those two numbers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    GoPowerCat's team of Kansas State insiders are providing on-the-ground updates on every development and insider scoop surrounding the Wildcats.

    "body": "\n        No. 22 BYU has won consecutive games for the first time since early January, but Saturday's 90-86 overtime victory over Colorado came at a price. Veteran guard Richie Saunders sustained a season-ending torn ACL in the win, the team announced Sunday.Saunders, the 2024-25 Big 12 Most Improved Player and the 10th-leading scorer in the conference this season, left the contest after just 45 seconds. He fell awkwardly on a drive-and-kick on the Cougars' opening possession and remained on the floor for several minutes as BYU trainers attended to him. Saunders walked into the locker room under his own power and did not return to action.BYU coach Kevin Young did not provide an update on Saunders' status in his postgame media availability and said he was waiting, along with everyone else, to learn about the severity of the injury.\"Unfortunate news last night -- I tore my ACL, ending my season,\" Saunders said in an Instagram post. \"Thank you for all the thoughts and prayers. They mean more than you know. To end my BYU career like this is heartbreaking. I've loved every moment and every challenge that came with representing the school I love. These past four years have shaped who I am -- on and off the court. Cougar Nation, thank you. Through the ups and downs, you've stuck with me. I'll never forget that.\"My story has never been one of ease. And while I didn't plan for this, my career is not over. I will return with more fight and more grit than before. My goals haven't changed. I don't always understand why things happen the way they do, but I trust that God is in the details. I trust His plan. The next chapter begins the same way I've always lived. Work With Faith.\"\nAlong with Texas Tech' JT Toppin, Saunders is one of just two Big 12 players to score more than 1,000 points over the last two campaigns. He averaged a career-best 18.0 points per game across 25 starts this season and was a two-way standout who also tallied 1.7 steals per contest.While BYU still boasts its top two scorers -- AJ Dybantsa leads the nation with 24.4 points per game and Rob Wright III averages 18.7 -- Saunders' absence for the rest of the season could prove devastating to the Cougars' chances of making a deep NCAA Tournament run. They had already fallen out of favor as a Final Four contender after losing four consecutive games against ranked opponents.\"It sucked the life out of the gym, if I'm being honest,\" Young said postgame. \"You never want to see an injury to any player, but definitely to someone who's the heart and soul of our team, bleeds BYU blue. Just didn't like seeing it. Unfortunately, you've gotta move on. You've gotta find a way to come in and channel that emotion.\"\nThe Saunders-less Cougars will have to adjust on the fly against two elite opponents in their next two games. Their first game without the senior guard comes Wednesday at No. 1 Arizona, and they square off against No. 5 Iowa State on Saturday.\n            ",

    "body": "\nBarcelona are still very much in charge of LaLiga's title race, especially so ahead of a trip to Girona in a match that feels like a classic mismatch poised to showcase their dominance in Spain's top flight. There are questions that loom large for Barcelona, though, especially with Thursday's defeat to Atletico Madrid still top of mind.Hansi Flick's side return to play for the first time since a startling 4-0 defeat to Atleti in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals, one in which Atleti unrelentingly exposed Barcelona's weaknesses – perhaps because those vulnerabilities have been easy to spot over the course of the season. Barcelona's defensive shakiness has been a defining feature since Flick took over at the start of the 2024-25 season, a frailty usually overcome by a mighty attack. It is an approach that guided them to the domestic double last season but is not foolproof. It may come as little surprise that a team like Atleti could find a way through Barcelona's porous defense but there have been openings for a wide range of opponents including Club Brugge, who Barcelona tied 3-3 with in the UEFA Champions League, and Slavia Praha, who kept things nervy despite losing 4-2 in the end.It perhaps comes as little surprise, then, that Flick's all gas, no breaks strategy is under scrutiny as Barcelona return to league play on Monday. Players reportedly told Flick that he should adjust his tactical preferences occasionally in the wake of the loss to Atleti, according to The AThletic, especially when the likes of Raphinha and Pedri are unavailable to pitch in from an attacking standpoint. Flick, meanwhile, took issue with the players' intensity levels during the first half.How to watch Girona vs. Barcelona, oddsDate: Monday, Feb. 15 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadi Montilivi -- Girona, SpainTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: ESPN SelectOdds: Girona +600; Draw +470; Barcelona -290Monday's trip to Girona may not provide the answer but as the season progresses, Flick once again faces an existential question about whether or not his preferred style has its limits. The visitors will be the oddsmakers' favorites to take all three points at Girona, in large part because the opponents have their own defensive woes. Girona have conceded 37 goals so far this season, three fewer than the league's worst team in that regard, Levante, putting them just two points above the relegation zone heading into Monday's match. They may like their chances against Barcelona's chaotic back line but even then, Girona are not known for their goalscoring ability – only four teams have fewer than their 22 goals in LaLiga this season.It makes for a favorable situation for Barcelona, who need a win to restore their one point lead over Real Madrid atop the table. Again, though, they are likely to be understaffed – Marcus Rashford and Pedri are dealing with injuries that will keep them out of Monday's match, while there are still question marks around Raphinha's availability. The Brazil international has not played since a win against Elche on January 31 while dealing with a short-term issue, but he did train Friday and could make a much-waited return on Monday.How many minutes he will be able to play is currently unclear, though his importance to the team certainly is not. Ferran Torres, Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski have held down the fort well with 10-plus goals each across all competitions but Raphinha has an oversized impact for Barcelona when he is available. He has 13 goals and five assists in all competitions, a sizable output for someone who has only been able to play 22 games so far this season, almost irreplaceable even though he has spent large chunks of the campaign on the sidelines. Case in point – they have lost just five matches in all competitions this season and Raphinha did not start in any of them, only coming off the bench in one of those matches.Raphinha's return will be a welcome one for Flick and company, who will prefer to call upon him as the push for silverware enters its final stages, and serves as a stark reminder that a closely-contested title race could very much be decided by fine margins, something the comeback of an impactful player should be very helpful with.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA All-Star Game is officially back. After years of embarrassing efforts, even by exhibition game standards, the players finally delivered a showcase that they, and the league, can be proud of -- even if the championship game of the new Team USA vs. Team World format was a bit of a dud. The USA Stars, the younger roster of American All-Stars, destroyed Team Stripes, to more veteran American group, 47-21, in the championship to lift the trophy after a thrilling round-robin series. Anthony Edwards, who poured in 32 points across Team Stars' three games, was named MVP, becoming the first Minnesota Timberwolves player to earn the honor since Kevin Garnett in 2003. After a fun night of action inside the Intuit Dome, here's a look at the winners and losers from the 2026 All-Star Game. Winner: Victor WembanyamaIn the lead up to Sunday's showcase, the French phenom made it clear that he was not happy with what the event had turned into in recent years, and was going to do his best to change it. \n\"I want to push the great players of this sport to play in the All-Star game just as hard as I will,\" Wembanyama said in January. \"We'll see how it goes, but if they don't play hard, I'll do it without them.\"He expanded on those thoughts on Saturday. \"Exclamation-point plays, playing in a solid manner and sharing the ball with energy,\" Wembanyama said, when asked how he planned to set a competitive tone. \"If you share that energy, people feel like they have a responsibility to share it back to you.\"\nWembanyama walked the walk right from the opening tip of the first game. Within the first two minutes, he threw down a huge slam, scored the first seven points for Team World and swatted a Jalen Duren attempt into the crowd. When Team World lost the opener in overtime because of a bad defensive rotation, he threw his hands up and stormed off the court like he had just lost a playoff game. \nEveryone else followed suit. \"I ain't gonna lie, Wemby set the tone,\" Anthony Edwards said. \"He came out and played hard, so it's hard not to match that.\" Winner: The NBABetween all of the tanking discourse, some of Adam Silver's comments during his Saturday press conference and a disastrous All-Star Saturday Night, the league was facing more public criticism than it had in a long time. As an entity, the last thing the NBA needed was another lifeless All-Star Game. Instead, the players delivered the most memorable mid-season showcase since 2020, and one of the most competitive events ever. \nThe first three games of the round robin format were awesome and all went down to the wire. Team Stars defeated Team World in overtime of Game 1 on a game-ending 3-pointer by Scottie BarnesTeam Stripes defeated Team Stars in Game 2 on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by De'Aaron FoxTeam Stripes defeated Team World in Game 3 on a last-second 3-pointer by Kawhi LeonardThe championship turned into a rout, as the much younger Team Stars cruised past the veteran-filled Team Stripes, who seemed to be out of gas. The last few minutes of that contest looked a lot like the previous All-Star Games. But even though the night ended on a low, the overall product was much better than anyone expected, and spared the league another wave of criticism. Loser: The championship gameAs mentioned, the new All-Star Game format pitting the best American players against the best international players was working to perfection through the round robin format, thanks to a big assist from Wembanyama. \nThe two American squads, Team Stars and Team Stripes, advanced to the championship, and everything was set up for a thrilling conclusion to the best All-Star Game in years. So, of course, we got a blowout. The younger Team Stars had way more juice left in their legs, and they jumped out to an early double-digit lead. Team Stripes briefly gave itself some hope with back-to-back 3s from LeBron James and Jalen Brunson to cut the deficit down to nine with seven minutes to play, but never got closer. While the night was an overall success, the way it ended was definitely a bummer. \nWinner: Kawhi LeonardLeonard has had a strange six months. During the offseason, Leonard was the subject of an investigative report by Pablo Torre that alleged the Clippers star had received $28 million via a fradulent marketing agreement that allowed his team to circumvent the salary cap. The NBA's investigation into the matter has not yet concluded. Shortly after the season got underway, Leonard was forced to the sidelines for nearly three weeks with ankle and foot sprains. The Clippers went 2-8 without him, part of a disastrous start to the season for the team, which was expecting to get back to the playoffs. A few days before Christmas, Leonard began one of the best stretches of his career, which included three 40-point outings in the span of five games, including a career-high 55 points in a win over the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons. The hot streak kicked off a stunning turnaround for the Clippers, who went from 6-21 to 26-28 in the span of two months to climb into Play-In Tournament position in the Western Conference. \nDespite an incredible last few weeks, Leonard wasn't initially named to the game, but eventually made it as an injury replacement. He proved to be a wise pick by Silver, and put on an incredible show in front of the Clippers fans on Sunday, as he helped Team Stripes reach the championship game. In Game 3 of the round-robin format, Leonard poured in 31 of Team Stripes' 48 points on 11-of-13 shooting from the field, including a 6-of-7 effort from 3-point range, and hit a game-winning triple over Karl-Anthony Towns (more on that later) in the closing seconds. Leonard's 12-minute bonanza was one of the best parts of the night, and was yet another reminder that when he's healthy, there are few better players in the world. \n\"It was great. Happy that Adam [Silver] let me in. That's what the home crowd wanted to see. I'm glad I was able to do something in that game,\" Leonard said. \nWinner: Anthony EdwardsEarlier this weekend, Edwards was blunt when asked for his thoughts on the state of the All-Star Game (\"It is what it is at this point\") and whether the new format would make a difference (\"No\"). But by the end of the first game, Edwards had changed his tune. \"I ain't gonna lie, Wemby set the tone,\" Edwards said. \"He came out and played hard, so it's hard not to match that.\" Edwards can at times appear aloof and \"too cool for school\" during press conferences, but on the court he's one of the league's most fierce competitors. It's unlikely that he went into Sunday night with a plan to play hard, but once Wembanyama had laid down a marker, he couldn't help but respond. \n\"Yeah, [Wembanyama] set the tone, man, and it woke me up, for sure,\" Edwards added after the game. Edwards had 13 points in Game 1, 11 points in Game 2 and eight points in the championship, for a total of 32 on the night, and was named All-Star MVP for his efforts. \nLoser: Karl-Anthony TownsTowns spends all season hearing about his defensive deficiencies, and how they might prevent the New York Knicks from winning a championship. All-Star Weekend is supposed to be a respite from that sort of talk, but somehow Towns found himself on the receiving end of even more criticism. \nGame 1 between Team World and Team Stars went to overtime, and instead of putting any time on the clock, a winning score of five points was set. Team World was up 3-2, and should have been playing a no-3s defense, but Towns for some reason rotated into the paint to try and stop Jalen Duren, which left Scottie Barnes wide open from behind the arc. Duren found Barnes for the game-winning shot. \nIn Game 3 between Team World and Team Stripes, the score was tied in the closing seconds when Towns got switched onto Leonard. Towns actually played pretty good defense, but Leonard drained a game-winning 3 right in his face. \nPoor Towns. The first time anyone has been expected to show any sort of effort on that end of the floor in the All-Star Game and he immediately finds himself on a defensive lowlight reel.\n            ",

San Francisco 49ers run game coordinator and tight ends coach Brian Fleury is headed to the Super Bowl champions to lead Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the rest of the Seattle offense, per NFL Media.The Seahawks lost Kubiak to the Las Vegas Raiders' coach opening, but they didn't go far to find his replacement -- either in terms of distance or approach. Fleury has been coaching in the NFL since 2013 and with the 49ers since 2019, rising in San Francisco from quality control coach to tight ends coach to run game coordinator and tight ends coach. He overlapped with Kubiak, who spent 2023 as the 49ers' pass game coordinator.Though it will be Fleury's first time calling plays, he'll likely bring over several of the elements that the Kyle Shanahan/Klint Kubiak offenses share, including heavy use of under center formations and play action. As run game coordinator and tight ends coach, Fleury worked with Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and others in San Francisco. McCaffrey had 2,126 yards from scrimmage in 2025, his only season with Fleury as the run game coordinator.The news of Fleury's hiring coincided with ESPN's Adam Schefter reporting the Raiders have hired Seahawks quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko as their offensive coordinator. Janocko was with Kubiak in Seattle and, before that, with the New Orleans Saints.\nThe Seahawks finished third in scoring offense and eighth in total offense in 2025, Kubiak's lone season in Seattle. Mike Macdonald will now hope he's nailed another offensive coordinator hire.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LeBron James is an All Star for a record-extending 22nd consecutive season. Whether or not it's his final one remains TBD. Speaking ahead of Sunday night's All-Star Game, the Los Angeles Lakers superstar remained mum on his basketball-playing future.\"When I know, you guys will know,\" James said about how he's feeling about playing next season. \"I don't know. I have no idea.\"James, 41, is in the final year of a two-year, $104 million deal, the fourth deal he has signed with the Lakers. He's averaging 22.0 points, 7.1 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game this season, with the scoring average on pace to be his lowest since his rookie season (2003-04) when he was still a teenager.James has already missed 18 games this season due to a variety of ailments, meaning he will not be eligible for All-NBA team selection -- there's a 65-game minimum -- which means his 21-year All-NBA streak will end. Still, he has shown moments of dominance, including a triple-double in the Lakers' 124-104 win over the Dallas Mavericks to send the team into the All-Star break.\nIt ended an eventful pre-break stretch for James, who also missed a game with left foot arthritis and, before that, shared a blunt assessment of his team.\"You want me to compare us to them? That's a championship team right there. We're not,\" James told reporters after Monday night's loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. \"We can't sustain energy and effort for 48 minutes, and they can. That's why they won a championship.\"The Lakers (33-21) are fifth in the Western Conference. On one hand, they have a point differential that suggests they should be closer to .500. On the other hand, they've rarely been fully healthy. Luka Dončić has missed 12 games, Austin Reaves has missed 26, and Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart have both missed 10. James acknowledged the health factor Sunday.\n\"It's too hard to really say what we're capable of,\" James said about the team's prospects following the All-Star break. \"I know that we've played some of our best basketball this season, we've looked very good. On the other side, we've been terrible. We've looked disgusting. I think the most important [thing] is if we can get healthy, how many minutes we can be on the floor, how much chemistry with can build with this sprint starting.\"\n            ",

Akshay Bhatia entered the final stanza as the 54-hole leader with a two-shot advantage on the field, but early Sunday, world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler went 7 under across his first seven holes to suddenly become the chief challenger in California.Reigning champion Rory McIlroy is completing his season debut stateside, but he ejected in Round 3. Still, there are some other significant names near the top of the leaderboard with Collin Morikawa seeking his first win since 2023 as the likes of Jordan Spieth, Sepp Straka, Min Woo Lee and Hideki Matsuyama battle for the winner's share.The $20 million signature event purse at Pebble Beach features a $3.6 million payout going to whomever wins the trophy and all top 10 finishers receiving $525,000 or more.Here's how you'll be able to follow all the action on the picturesque California coast as the final round wraps up at the season's biggest event to this point.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am TV schedule All times Eastern\nRound 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 10:30 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 10:30 a.m. - 8 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports AppLive TV coverage: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\nRadio: 1-6:30 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Arizona remained a No. 1 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model following its second straight loss on Saturday, but it did fall in the overall hierarchy. The Wildcats (23-2, 10-2 Big 12) are now the third No. 1 seed behind Michigan and Duke after falling 78-75 in overtime against Texas Tech.From a metrics-based standpoint, the Blue Devils (23-2, 12-1) have the No. 2 overall spot behind Michigan solidly triangulated after beating Clemson 67-54. They are No. 2 in WAB, which is a key resume metric, and they are also No. 2 at KenPom, which is a predictive metric on NCAA team sheets.There was also activity on the 2-seed line following a busy day of action. Iowa State's 74-56 win over Kansas sent the Cyclones back up to No. 2 seed territory in CBS Sports Bracketology. The rise of Iowa State (22-3, 9-3 Big 12) temporarily dislodged Illinois, dropping the Illini to a No. 3 seed ahead of their game against Indiana on Sunday.The Cyclones get another huge home opportunity Monday night against Houston in a Big 12 showdown. The Cougars remain the fourth No. 1 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model as of Sunday following their 78-64 win over Kansas State.Heading into Sunday's action, here's the breakdown of where things stand along the top lines in CBS Sports Bracketology.\n  Bracketology top seeds       \t \t \t \t \tSeedMidwestEastWestSouthNo. 1                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    No. 2                                                     \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    Check out the full field of 68 at the CBS Sports Bracketology hub.Texas Tech moves upOur model's pregame forecast suggested Texas Tech would rise within the No. 4 seed line but perhaps not reach the No. 3 seed line with an upset win at Arizona. However, once all the day's results and metric changes were factored in, Texas Tech emerged as the final No. 3 seed. Given that the Red Raiders now have wins over three of the four teams currently projected as No. 1 seeds, it's no surprise to see them rewarded. Critically, Texas Tech rose four spots from No. 15 to No. 11 in WAB, which is a vital resume metric that recognized the Red Raiders for slaying a highly ranked opponent on the road. Additionally, the Red Raiders enjoyed a six-spot jump at KenPom, rising to No. 16 in that predictive metric.\nFlorida making a charge Florida picked up another gain in WAB, rising from 14th to 13th following its 92-83 win over Kentucky. The Gators are still a No. 3 seed for now, but they are knocking on the door of a No. 2 seed. Alone atop the SEC standings, Florida (19-6, 10-2) rates neck and neck with Houston in barttorvik.com's measurement of who the nation's most-efficient team has been over the past six weeks. While four early-season losses diminished Florida's standing in resume metrics, this team is acing the eye test and looking like a juggernaut in predictive analytics that appear on team sheets. As a result, their standing in the NCAA's early top 16 reveal next Saturday will make for an interesting case study.\n            ",

The Wolverines lead college basketball in scoring margin this season and rank No. 1 at analytics sites KenPom.com and BartTorvik.com. It is also No. 1 in Sunday's NET rankings (and our Top 25 and 1).The Wolverines will be the fourth No. 1 team in the AP poll this season joining Purdue, Houston and the aforementioned Arizona Wildcats. No team besides Arizona has held the top spot for longer than three consecutive weeks.That change is one of many coming to Monday's overhauled rankings. Among top 10 teams last week, six suffered at least at least one loss, including every team ranked in the No. 7-10 range. Those results should have big ramifications in the refreshed ranks.\nBelow is how I suspect voters will react to the week's results.1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Wins by 12 and by 30 over Northwestern and UCLA, respectively, propelled Michigan to 24-1 this week -- and positioned it to take over the No. 1 spot this week. The Wolverines are 14-1 in Big Ten play and in the catbird seat to be the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament.2\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    Another perfect week has Houston moving up for a fourth consecutive polll and into its highest ranking on the season.

But voters aren't likely to punish the Wildcats much given the overwhelmingly great start to the season. I have them falling to No. 3 but it's possible Duke jumps to No. 3 and Arizona slides to No. 4.4\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Duke did not drop in the poll last week after a 71-68 loss at UNC, and I have the Blue Devils remaining at No. 4 after wins over Pitt and Clemson this week. The total number of points in the AP poll should be close between it and Arizona, and a move to No. 3 is in play.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    After last week's 81-72 loss at St. John's, UConn responded with wins over Butler and Georgetown to keep its resume at just two losses.

That should push the Boilermakers back inside the top 10.9\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Florida\n                    \n    \n    Voters could reward Florida, winners of 10 of its last 11, with a spot inside the top 10 this week. It defeated Kentucky at home over the weekend to improve to 10-2 in SEC play and stands alone atop the league standings.10\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Virginia\n                    \n    \n    This would be a big rise for Virginia but if voters take a hard look at every team's resume in this range, it's hard to argue a five-spot rise isn't warranted. Ryan Odom's Cavaliers have won six straight -- and 11 of 12 -- after a victory over Ohio State this weekend.

It's hard to imagine the Jayhawks fall too far, but they are likely to tumble.12\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Nebraska\n                    \n    \n    Three losses in its last five outings could push Nebraska outside the top 10. All three of those losses have come the last three weeks -- and all three make up its entire loss tally on the season -- but the Cornhuskers are trending down, and voters will take notice.13\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            N.

That was part of its 1-1 week that culminated with a home win over Pitt.14\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Texas Tech\n                    \n    \n    Grant McCasland's Red Raiders will be moving up after extending their winning streak to three in style with a 78-75 win at No. 1 Arizona on Saturday.15\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Illinois\n                    \n    \n    Illinois shook off a two-game funk with a much-needed 71-51 win at home Sunday over Indiana. Both its previous losses were in OT, but came at a time when several other teams in this range were positioned to leap teams in the back half of last week's top 10 -- thus the reason for the Illini dropping to the early teens here.16\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    Following an emotional home win over Big East contender UConn last week, St. John's responded with resilient wins over Xavier and Providence this week, extending its winning streak to 11 games. The Johnnies are very much back to playing like the preseason No. 5 team, though their 9-5 start to the season will likely keep voters from moving it much higher than this range.17\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    Three losses in its last four outings will have voters dropping Michigan State several spots Monday. The only win in that span came against a shorthanded Illinois team in OT.18\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    Vandy bounced back from its ugly home loss at OU last Saturday with wins over Auburn and Texas A&M. It has five wins in its last six games.19\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Saint Louis\n                    \n    \n    A Friday night win over Loyola Chicago moved Saint Louis (24-1) to a perfect 12-0 in A-10 play. With six regular-season games remaining, the Billikens are on a trajectory to be one of only a handful of 30-win teams going into March Madness.20\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    Three consecutive wins -- by an average margin of 20.7 points -- has Arkansas sitting alone in second in the SEC standings and just one game back of Florida. John Calipari's team has a tough mid-week test upcoming with a road trip to Alabama.21\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miami (Ohio)\n                    \n    \n    Travis Steele's perfect Redhawks (25-0) will be ranked Monday for a fifth consecutive week after a 90-74 home win over Ohio in their lone outing this week. They should be up at least one spot, too, which would mark their highest ranking on the season.22\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    Louisville's 4-3 January very much feels like history after it defeated NC State and Baylor to push its winning streak to five games. Freshman Mikel Brown has been sensational in that stretch, and he scored 45 and 29 vs. NC State and Baylor, respectively, this week.23\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    Star BYU guard Rob Wright tallied career-highs in scoring twice this week to help the Cougars shake off their four-game losing streak. They enter Wednesday's game against Arizona on a two-game winning streak thanks to 30 and 39 point explosions in wins over Baylor and Colorado.24\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Clemson\n                    \n    \n    Clemson suffered losses in outings to Virginia Tech and Duke and is in jeopardy of falling out of Monday's rankings.

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

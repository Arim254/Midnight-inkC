    "body": "\n        Outside of the Triple Crown, perhaps no horse race generates as much buzz as the Breeders' Cup Classic, with this year's running taking place on Saturday with a 6:25 p.m. ET post time. Del Mar Racetrack in the San Diego area will host the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic, which features nine of the best thoroughbreds competing over 1 1/4 miles. The Breeders' Cup weather is expected to be about perfect at around 65 degrees, likely creating a fast track. The field for this year's race is loaded, even with the scratch of Derby-Belmont double winner, Sovereignty. Among those still in the field are Preakness victor, Journalism, Travers Stakes champion, Fierceness and Sierra Leone, who enters the Breeders' Cup Classic 2025 as the defending winner.Users can jump on the latest TwinSpires promo code CBSSPORTS to receive up to $400 in bonus bets to wager on almost any track:Horses aged 3 and older can compete in this race, which allows Sierra Leone to seek back-to-back wins. Fierceness is the 5-2 favorite, per the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic odds, with Sierra Leone and the Japan-based Forever Young both at 7-2. Journalism is at 5-1 to utilize in horse racing bets, while even a 20-1 longshot like Nevada Beach can't be overlooked as he's trained by four-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner, Bob Baffert. With several of the world's best horses set to enter the starting gate, you'll want to see what SportsLine horse racing expert Jeff Hochman has to say before making any 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic picks or horse racing predictions.Hochman has shown a profit in 22 of the past 39 Triple Crown races. One example of his best picks was Big Brown in the 2008 Kentucky Derby at odds of 2-1. More recently, he swept the 2022 Triple Crown, capped off by Mo Donegal's easy win in the Belmont Stakes. In 2023, he cashed the Preakness with National Treasure. In 2024, he successfully tabbed Straight No Chaser to win, place and show in the Grade 2 Santa Anita Sprint Championship at odds of 3-2.\nHochman delivered exceptional handicapping results during the summer 2025 racing season at two of the country's premier tracks, Saratoga and Del Mar. His combined 65.7% win rate across the two tracks represents elite-level performance that significantly exceeds industry benchmarks for professional handicappers. Anyone who has followed him on betting apps like TwinSpires and 1/ST BET could have been way up, even more if they used the latest TwinSpires offer code or 1/ST BET promo code.For the Breeders' Cup World Championships, Hochman has handicapped the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic field, made his picks, and constructed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.Top 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic predictionsOne of Hochman's surprising Breeders' Cup Classic 2025 picks: He is high on Journalism (5-1), despite not being one of the top three favorites. The horse has placed either first or second in each of his last nine starts, including winning both the Preakness and the Haskell Stakes. He finished as runner-up at both the Kentucky Derby and Belmont, but the horse who beat him in those starts, Sovereignty, is no longer in the Breeders' Cup Classic field.\nThat brightens Journalism's prospects for Saturday, as does the recent jockey change from Umberto Rispoli to Jose Ortiz. While the former led the horse to lots of success, he has zero wins across 18 starts at the Breeders' Cup World Championships. Meanwhile, Ortiz has six victories at the series, including prevailing at the Breeders' Cup Mile last year. With the upgrade at jockey, and with his chief competition being scratched from this race, Journalism shouldn't be overlooked with Breeders' Cup Classic bets. See which horses to back here.New users can target the 1/ST BET promo code 500BET which offers up to $500 in wagering credits for the 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic:How to make 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic   bets, picksInstead, Hochman's top pick is a horse who is \"truly elite.\" He's also high on a double-digit longshot who \"enters on an upward trajectory\" and who he classifies as a \"dangerous outsider.\" Hochman is sharing who he likes, along with his top 2025 Breeders' Cup Classic   picks, over at SportsLine.\nWhich horse wins the Breeders' Cup Classic 2025, and how should you construct your wagers?

    "body": "\n        The Dodgers survived Game 6 of the World Series by the skin of their teeth, doubling off the tying run in the ninth inning to end with a 3-1 victory. So what's there to do but question a managerial move in hindsight?It's pretty simple, really: You don't get to figure out how to win Game 7 unless you actually get to Game 7. That was the problem facing Dodgers manager Dave Roberts late Friday night. He couldn't possibly think about what he was going to do in Game 7 if his team blew Game 6 and they were staring down the barrel. The Dodgers took a 3-1 lead into the ninth inning. Roki Sasaki, converted to a closer for the playoffs, had already pitched the eighth inning. He led off the ninth by hitting Alejandro Kirk with a pitch and then gave up a double to Addison Barger. The tying run was on second base with no outs. The top of the Blue Jays' powerful order was just around the corner. At this point, Sasaki had thrown 33 pitches. He threw 36 pitches on Oct. 9, but the last time he'd thrown more than that was in May. Tyler Glasnow was ready in the bullpen. The complication here, or so some people might think, is that Glasnow was the Game 3 starting pitcher, which means he was lined up for Game 7. Emmet Sheehan could have been used in the ninth. Of course, Sheehan has a 9.95 ERA in five playoff outings. Blake Treinen has a 6.75 ERA. Glasnow's stuff as good as anyone in the majors when he's on. \nRoberts correctly, with his team's back against the proverbial wall, made the move. Glasnow miraculously escaped with a pop up and line-drive double play in just three pitches. Now, the Dodgers' options for Game 7 aren't ideal, but who cares? Again, you're down three games to two in a seven-game series. You can't think about Game 7 until you get there. If you don't win Friday, there is no Saturday. Roberts was asked about a possible Game 7 before Game 6 and he said this:\"It's more of just kind of doing whatever we can to get through [Game 6] and then pick up the pieces and then see what's the best way to attack a potential Game 7. So everything should be on the table and will be, for sure.\"\nYes. Very well said, Mr. Roberts. Shohei Ohtani should be the starter in Game 7 anyway, as long as the Dodgers are planning on using him on the mound at all. Maybe Blake Snell comes back on short rest and works an inning or two (or more). Perhaps Glasnow isn't gassed from his three whole pitches and is helpful in relief of Ohtani. I think we should expect all three to get work. \"I'm not sure the pitching situation, but Glasnow will be available. Everyone will be available,\" Roberts said after Game 6 before catching himself and noting that Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw six innings Friday night, will not be available.  Justin Wrobleski was good in Game 6 and could go again. Maybe Sasaki sees more action, though I'm not sure they'd try to stretch him beyond an inning after his heavy Game 6 workload. Maybe Sheehan or Treinen get a chance. Anthony Banda is ready to face a block that includes a lefty or two. Maybe Clayton Kershaw? \nThe Dodgers can piece this together and they have that chance because Roberts wouldn't fret over using his potential Game 7 starter in Game 6. As an old coach of mine used to say, you can't dance if you don't arrive at the prom.Now the Dodgers are there and they'll piece it together as need be. It's Game 7.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers forced a decisive Game 7 of the World Series with their 3-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays in Friday's Game 6. The outcome was in doubt until the instant the game ended, and that's because of a bottom of the ninth that was as bizarre as it was tense. To open the frame, Toronto catcher Alejandro Kirk reached when an 0-2 splitter got away from Dodgers relief ace Roki Sasaki and struck Kirk on the hand (X-rays were negative). Next man up Addison Barger then scalded a double to the wall in left-center that likely would've scored the hasty Myles Straw, who was pinch-running for Kirk, had things unfolded in standard fashion. Things, though, did not unfold in standard fashion: Barger's ringer immediately upon landing got stuck between the bottom of the wall and the warning track, which made it a dead ball. Dodgers fly-catchers Justin Dean and Kiké Hernández promptly signaled as much, and the umpires agreed, which made it a rulebook double. That, in turn, meant that Straw was allowed to advance just two bases, and that placed him at third and probably took a Toronto run off the board. The ruling was upheld on review. Unlucky ball placement notwithstanding, the Jays were still in strong position. At the start of the home half of the ninth, the Jays, down two runs with three offensive outs to go, had just an 8.9% chance of winning Game 6 and closing out the series, per basic win expectancy. With runners on second and third and no outs, however, that figure was up to 43%. That's not quite coin-flip territory, but it's close to it.\nAt that point, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts summoned Tyler Glasnow, his Game 3 starter, from the bullpen to make a (very) high-leverage bullpen appearance. Straightaway, he retired Ernie Clement on a first-pitch foul pop. That brought No. 9 hitter Andrés Giménez to the dish. Glasnow threw him a 1-0 sinker on the outer edge, and Giménez put a decent swing on it. He lifted it to shallow left -- 247 feet from home plate -- and into the perilous dead zone where batted balls so often find grass between outgoing infielders and incoming outfielders. In the case of Giménez's struck ball, Statcast gave it an expected batting average of .710. In other words, the Jays had a seven in 10 chance of either tying the game or having the tying run 90 feet away with one out. Before we roll tape, here's how two of this writer's CBS Sports colleagues reacted in real time to what you're about to see: Expectations were defied:\nOut in left, Kiké Hernández said he was \"playing a little more shallow than the [defensive positioning] card wanted me to\" on account of Barger's speed at second base. As well, Hernández noted that Giménez had more power to hill pull side, which to his very prescient thinking justified his decision to play more in. The already unlikely snare was even more improbable than you might think. Hernández also said this postgame on the broadcast:\n\"Somehow I was able to hear that the bat broke, even with that crowd. The crazy thing is I had no idea where the ball was 'cause it was in the lights the whole time.\"Perhaps the Hernández catch should be promoted to miracle territory.That, though, was merely the second out. Back at second base, Barger, no doubt wanting to improve his chances at scoring on what he surely read as a single to left, hustled too far off the bag. That gave Hernández enough time to heave the ball to second. There, Miguel Rojas -- in Roberts' starting lineup for the first time since NLDS Game 2 on Oct. 6 -- made an athletic pick that was probably about as difficult as Hernández's catch. Barger was out by inches and, once replay confirmed, Game 6 was over and Game 7 was a reality. \"I was pretty surprised he got to it,\" Barger explained after the game. \"Off the bat, I thought it was going to go over the shortstop's head. I didn't think it was going to travel that far. It was kind of a bad read.\"Those \"coin-flip\" odds the Jays approached earlier in the inning? In the span of three Glasnow pitches, those odds were down to zero. There are many such unforgettable high-intrigue late innings in the annals of World Series history, and this one surely merits a place among them. The Jays did all they could with those final three outs, but the inches, percentage points, miscalculations, and Dodger defense all conspired against a comeback. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays by a 3-1 final on Friday in a thrilling Game 6 of the World Series on Friday night. In turn, the Dodgers evened the best-of-seven set at 3-3 and forced a decisive Game 7 on Saturday night. The question for the Dodgers now becomes: who starts on the mound in the championship-deciding contest?As we laid out during Thursday's travel day, the Dodgers should be able to leverage their outstanding rotation to protect against overexposing a leaky bullpen. At the time, Tyler Glasnow looked like the obvious candidate to work in a bulk capacity in a potential Game 7, with Games 4 and 5 starters (Shohei Ohtani and Blake Snell) available to slot in for a few innings apiece since they no longer had to be held in reserve for a future appearance.Well, Glasnow was needed in Game 6. He got the final three outs on just three crucial pitches. Coming in with runners on second and third and no outs against the World Series-winning run at the plate, Glasnow got Ernie Clement to pop out on one pitch before Andrés Giménez lined into a wild game-ending double play on Glasnow's third offering. It seems unlikely that Glasnow's brief outing will prevent him from pitching (and perhaps pitching a lot) on Saturday. Yet there are other, logistical reasons why Glasnow may again enter in relief rather than getting the nod -- and, furthermore, why Ohtani will likely be used as the official starter, even if it's just as an opener. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did not name a Game 7 starter after the Game 6 win on Friday night. Though Ohtani will get the nod in Game 7, per the New York Post.\nOhtani is the most logical choice to start. Why? MLB rules state that Ohtani can only remain in the game to bat as the designated hitter if he's also the starting pitcher. Here's the pertinent information from the MLB rulebook -- specifically Rule 5.11(b), or the Ohtani Rule:Starting Pitcher as Designated Hitter. It is not mandatory that a Club designate a hitter for the pitcher. However, in the event the starting pitcher will bat for himself, the player will be considered two separate people for purposes of Rule 5.11(a). In such cases, the manager should list 10 players on his team's lineup card, and this player should be named twice – once as the starting pitcher and once as the Designated Hitter. Thus, if the starting pitcher is replaced, he can continue as the Designated Hitter (but can no longer pitch in the game), and if the Designated Hitter is replaced, he can continue as the pitcher (but can no longer hit for himself). If the player is simultaneously replaced both as a starting pitcher and Designated Hitter, he cannot be replaced by another two-way player filling both roles as separate people (this can be done only once on the initial lineup card by identifying that the starting pitcher will bat for himself).Do note that the rulebook makes it clear that it applies only to the starting pitcher. There are no carveouts for relievers. If Ohtani entered Game 7 as a reliever, the Dodgers would only be able to keep his bat in the lineup as long as he was still on the mound.Of course, even if the Dodgers did find some language that would allow them to use this rule with Ohtani entering as a reliever, they may opt against it. In such a scenario, they'd have to navigate the tricky situation of having him warm up while also taking his at-bats as the lineup dictated. That's a tough juggling act given that Ohtani is accustomed to a warm-up routine befitting a starter.\nOhtani's likely nod will come against future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer. The first World Series Game 7 in six years will not lack star power.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Approaching the midpoint of the regular season with NFL Week 9, we're finally starting to see some NFL betting trends emerge in regard to the spread. Favorites have covered in 57.5% of games, while home favorites are at almost 59%. The Week 9 NFL odds have just six of the 14 games with the home team favored, but you can lean into these trends with your Week 9 NFL bets. Among the home favorites are the Lions (-8.5) versus Minnesota, the Packers (-13.5) against Carolina and the Rams (-14) versus New Orleans, as the Saints will see QB Tyler Shough making his first career start. Despite those large NFL spreads, not every home favorite is giving a touchdown or more. Texans vs. Broncos has Houston as 1.5-point favorites as Denver comes to town for a matchup of top-five defenses. Whether you prefer to make Week 9 NFL predictions on contests with narrow lines or large ones, having optimal NFL betting advice from proven experts is essential.

One of his top NFL player props for Week 9 is Chicago going Under 27.5 points (-122) at the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.\"I'm well aware of how bad that Bengals defense is. But I've watched the Bears forever. I'm not saying I can count off the top of my head how many times they have scored at least 28 points in a road game, but I'm probably not far off as it's not that many. Remember the last time: Oct. 5, 2023 at Washington. Would I go any lower on this (a couple of 26.5s on our board)? Nope.

He is 4-1 (+278) over his last five NFL picks and is backing Green Bay (-13.5) to cover at home versus Carolina in a Sunday 1 p.m. ET kickoff.\"This line continues to be on the move and I'm going to go ahead and lock it in. Packers are at home and they're up against either Bryce Young or Andy Dalton behind an injury ravaged offensive line. That same offensive line undertook additional injuries on Sunday against the Bills. The Packers offense looks to be clicking off the bye and is getting healthier at the skill positions.

He is 18-8 (+899) over his last 26 NFL ATS picks and is 5-1 over his last ATS picks in Colts games. He is backing Indianapolis (-3) to cover at Pittsburgh on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.\"Aaron Rodgers is not quite past his sell-by date, but his receivers aren't making enough difficult catches, too reliant upon DK Metcalf (especially if TE Pat Freiermuth is out). It was the defense, however, that alarmed vs. the Packers, as Sunday night became target practice for Jordan Love. Meanwhile the Colts are doing everything right in their 7-1 break from the gate, with Jonathan Taylor supplying the thunder on the ground and Daniel Jones the lightning thru the air.

Yahoo Sports reported that the raise that Lashlee will receive will make him one of the top-10 highest-paid coaches in the sport.Lashlee, 42, guided SMU to the College Football Playoff and an appearance in the ACC title game during the 2024 campaign. Lashlee has been with the program since the 2022 season and has compiled a 34-15 record at the school. The Mustangs are currently 5-3 heading into a showdown against No. 10 Miami on Saturday.Lashlee was connected to the Arkansas job shortly after the program fired Sam Pittman earlier this month. The former Arkansas quarterback has ties to the school, making him a logical candidate for the position. However, when asked about upcoming job openings, Lashlee quickly shot down the rumors.\n\"I don't stand anywhere on speculation and hypotheticals,\" Lashlee said earlier this month. \"I'm happy, I've got a great job. I think when your name gets linked to jobs it means your team has done well, the program has done well. So it's a compliment to what our staff and administration and players have built over the last three-plus years. Then a lot of times there's obvious connections. If it's your alma mater, it's easy to link names. But I haven't given it any thought because there hasn't been anything to give thought to. It's a great, fair question. But I'm really excited with what we're building here.\"SMU rewarded Lashlee with a new contract last fall that previously tied him to the school through the 2030 season.\nLashlee is the latest coach to sign an extension with his school, rather than potentially joining the coaching carousel. Nebraska and Matt Rhule agreed on an extension earlier this week, while Indiana secured a long-term deal with coach Curt Cignetti to keep him with the program.\n            \n    ",

Kevin Gausman had just one bad inning, but that was all it took for the Dodgers' win.The series so far has been a back-and-forth affair. The Blue Jays won Game 5 behind a record-setting Trey Yesavage start and back-to-back home runs to lead off the game, and Game 4 before that by beating Shohei Ohtani. The Dodgers took a wild Game 3 on a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run in the 18th inning Monday. Yoshinobu Yamamoto tossed a complete game in Los Angeles' Game 2 win, while the Blue Jays won Game 1 in an 11-4 blowout, including a grand slam by Addison Barger as part of a nine-run sixth inning.The Dodgers are back in the World Series for the second year in a row, looking to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers last week and had a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, took a tougher route through the ALCS but came out victorious in Game 7 against the Seattle Mariners. This marks their first World Series appearance since 1993. \nBelow is a look at the full 2025 MLB playoff bracket.  2025 MLB playoff bracket \n                                                                    Keytron Jordan, CBS Sports\n                                                             2025 MLB playoff schedule All games on ESPN, ABC, Fox and FS1 are streaming on fubo (Try for free).

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                WWE\n            \n            \n    \n        Seth Rollins is out of action until next year. On Friday, Rollins announced that his shoulder injury will keep him sidelined from WWE well into 2026.Rollins provided the update while guest-hosting \"Good Morning Football\" this week. Dressed in a bear suit and a No. 76 Chicago Bears jersey for Halloween, Rollins told the program that he wouldn't be back in the ring for another six months.\"I wish I could rip this thing off, man, but I'm out, guys. I'm out of action for six months,\" Rollins said. \"My world championship is going to be worn by some schmuck, either Jey Uso or CM Punk. It's awful. It really is the Halloween scaries, but I'm here. I'm here in a full bear suit.\"\nRollins was written off television on the Oct. 13 episode of WWE Raw. The Vision's Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed attack Rollins, sidelining their faction leader for the foreseeable future. It's believed the segment was booked after Rollins legitimately injured his shoulder in a winning effort against Cody Rhodes at Crown Jewel. A new world heavyweight champion will be crowned at Saturday Night's Main Event. CM Punk was granted the match after Rollins was forced to vacate the title. Jey Uso subsequently won a battle royal to qualify for the vacant title match with Punk.\nBack in July, LA Knight prematurely pinned Rollins after Rollins suffered what appeared to be a knee injury. Subsequent reports were split on the legitimacy of the injury, with even Rollins' manager, Paul Heyman, telling CBS Sports that media misdirection was part of WWE's creative direction. The previous injury proved to be a ruse after Rollins returned one month later at SummerSlam, cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase on Punk.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nTottenham will host Chelsea on Saturday for a key Premier League match in London. The side coached by Thomas Frank is currently third in the standings with 17 points after nine games while Chelsea are ninth with 14 points and this London derby can definitely change the direction of this season for both teams. Since beating Burnley on the opening day of 2025-26, Tottenham have lost at home to Bournemouth and Aston Villa, while only a last-minute equaliser spared them defeat to Wolves. Speaking to the media ahead of Saturday's game, Frank spoke about Maresca's job at Chelsea: \"Enzo's done an amazing job at Chelsea. First season, qualifying for the Champions League and won the Conference League, so competing in definitely more than one front. Won the Club World Cup and had a decent start to the season, very impressive. It was very clear what him and his staff want to achieve, how they want to play.\" Here's what you need to know.\nViewing informationDate: Saturday, Nov. 1 | Time: 1:30 p.m. ETLocation: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium -- LondonLive stream: PeacockOdds: Tottenham +171; Draw +253; Chelsea +149Possible lineupsTottenham XI: Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Kevin Danso, Micky van de Ven, Djed Spence; Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur; Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Bergvall, Xavi Simons; Randal Kolo Muani.Chelsea XI: Robert Sanchez; Reece James, Wesley Fofana, Trevoh Chalobah, Marc Cucurella; Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo; Pedro Neto, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens; Tyrique George.PredictionBoth sides will lose some key points if they lose on Saturday and they might be scared of it. PICK: Tottenham 1, Chelsea 1. What's on CBS Sports Golazo Network🥅 Scoreline (Daily): Scoreline is the newest place for fans to catch up on all the biggest news and results impacting global football, match highlights from the top soccer competitions and all the can't-miss goals from the day's action, starting Thursday and airing seven days a week.📺 How to watch: CBS Sports Golazo Network is a free 24/7 channel exclusively dedicated to offering unparalleled coverage of all the top soccer competitions worldwide.

The Dodgers won Game 6 Friday night, tying the series once again. The winner on Saturday takes home the World Series trophy. The loser leaves empty-handed.The Dodgers are trying to become the first back-to-back World Series champions since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees. The Blue Jays are looking for their first title since back-to-back wins in 1992 and 1993.The Jays punched their ticket to the Fall Classic with an ALCS Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners. This is Toronto's first World Series appearance since 1993, when they won their second consecutive title. The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series. They are the first defending champion to reach the World Series the next season since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies, and, in more than a few ways, this year's Dodgers are better than last year's.The Blue Jays (94-68) have home-field advantage over the Dodgers (93-69) in the World Series because they had the better regular-season record.

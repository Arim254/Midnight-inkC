    "body": "\n        The latest DraftKings promo code offers $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. The Monday college basketball schedule features a top-five clash with No. 5 Iowa State hosting No. 3 Houston at 9 p.m. ET, and one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick from this contest as part of Monday college basketball best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. Iowa State is favored by 2.5 points at home, according to the latest college basketball odds.The SportsLine Projection Model has also locked in a pair of Monday college basketball best bets, including Over 142.5 total points for No. 4 Duke vs. Syracuse, and Drexel to cover as 3.5-point underdogs against Stony Brook in an 8 p.m. ET matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times and it enters Week 15 on a sizzling 11-1 run on its top-rated over/under college basketball picks dating back to last season, and is on an 11-5 run on top-rated CBB side picks. Anyone following its college basketball betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookDuke vs. Syracuse: Over 142.5 total points (-112)Drexel (+3.5) vs. Stony Brook (-102)Houston (+2.5) vs. Iowa State (-115)Combining the three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +600 (risk $100 to win $600). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):Duke vs. Syracuse: Over 142.5 total points (-112)The Over is 5-1-1 over the last seven Syracuse games, and 9-2-1 over its last 12 contests. A significant reason why is that Syracuse has the No. 108 scoring defense, allowing 72.2 points per game this season. Meanwhile, Duke is averaging 82.8 ppg this season. Duke vs. Syracuse contests have gone Over this number in six of their last nine meetings, and that's a trend the model expects to continue Monday. Duke freshman Cameron Boozer is fourth in the nation in scoring at 22.2 ppg, and he'll be a problem for the Orange. The model projects the Over to hit in 73% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:\nDrexel (+3.5) vs. Stony Brook (-102)Drexel and Stony Brook have identical 7-6 records in CAA play this season, and the line favors Stony Brook with this contest being played on its campus on Long Island, New York. However, Drexel has split its last four road games, and it is 7-3 over its last 10 contests. Stony Brook has played in tight battles at home recently, with five of its last six home games either decided by five points or fewer or going into overtime. Drexel defeated Stony Brook, 56-37, at home in their first matchup this season, and Drexel defeated Stony Brook on the road, 67-51, last year. The model projects Drexel to cover in 83% of simulations. Back Drexel to cover at DraftKings here:Houston (+2.5) vs. Iowa State (-115)\"Houston (23-2) rides in on a six-game winning streak,\" SportsLine expert Micah Roberts said. \"The Cougars are visiting Ames, Iowa, where they will be underdogs for the first time this season against Iowa State (22-3). Houston has returned to its traditional format of controlling games with defense, staying Under the total in its last five games. Houston is now No. 2 nationally, allowing 61.3 points a game. Iowa State averages 84.2 points and shoots 50.6 percent from the field, and the Cyclones come off a beatdown of Kansas after losing at TCU. Iowa State has stayed Under the total in its last three games. This total is only 134.5, which is built on both teams' defensive trends. While the Cyclones are 14-0 at home, I bet on the Houston defense.\" Back Houston to cover at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

That doesn't mean Judge is content with his game. Rather, he's looking to add a new dimension this year.\"Baserunning's on my mind this year a lot,\" Judge told reporters on Monday. \"I saw a lot of guys around the league with 40, 30 bases that you don't usually normally expect to be running that much. Especially with how the game's changed with the pickoffs and the pitch clock, I think that's one way we can utilize, or, at least, I can utilize some of my skills a little bit more, getting into scoring position.\"With the lineup we have, this was probably the best offense in all of baseball last year. If I can find a way to get myself in scoring position, if they're going to walk me or do something, then some good things are going to happen.\"\nTo Judge's point, 17 different players swiped at least 30 bases in 2025. That group included the likes of Juan Soto (38) and Josh Naylor (30), neither of whom fits the conventional picture of a high-volume thief. In fact, Soto and Naylor both finished in the 13th percentile or worse in Statcast's sprint speed, suggesting their steals were the products of their smarts -- and their leveraging of the aforementioned pickoff limit and pitch clock rules -- instead of their wheels. Judge, for comparison, ranked in the 42nd percentile in that measure, which helps to explain why he's been a legitimate center-field option for the Yankees in the past despite his size.\nJudge, 33, has never stolen more than 16 bases in a single campaign despite succeeding at around a 75% clip. The key matter for the Yankees is whether or not the additional value he'd provide in running more often would be worth the downside of increasing his injury risk. Given how much Judge produces at the plate (he's hit .312/.445/.674 and averaged 49 home runs over the last three years), the Yankees can be excused if they decide by Opening Day to give him the red light just as often as in the past.\n            \n    ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag.

    "body": "\nThe second year pf the new format of the UEFA Champions League, brought plenty of chaos on the final day of the league phase as 18 matches kicked off at the same time. Storylines can get muddled along the way during a jam-packed period of action but one stood out above the rest, fully embodying the drama of the day.Real Madrid started the day well-positioned to finish in the top eight and book a direct spot in the round of 16, a favorable match against a Benfica team who were poised for elimination awaiting them. The script fully flipped, though -- Benfica came out with an improbable 4-2 win, rounded out by a red card for Real Madrid's Raul Asencio and the final goal of the game coming from shot-stopper Anatoliy Trubin. Benfica, coached by ex-Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, snuck their way into the knockout phase playoffs while Los Blancos were doomed to play another two games in the hopes of booking a spot in the last 16.It makes for an unusual but perfect set-up for a rematch three weeks later, a painful reward for Benfica despite their hard work and a golden opportunity for Real Madrid to fully put that Matchday 8 defeat behind them.How to watch Benfica vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Tuesday, Feb. 16 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio da Luz -- Lisbon, PortugalLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Benfica +280; Draw +290; Real Madrid -115Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

We will play the first leg with our heads, with ambition and confidence. We know what we did to the kings of the Champions League … Real Madrid is Real Madrid, with history, knowledge, ambition. The only comparable thing is that we are two giants. Beyond that, there is nothing else. But football has this power and we can win.\"The circumstances could see Mourinho change his approach from the teams' last meeting, too. Benfica were more forward-thinking than usual in their win over Los Blancos, in large part because they simply needed to score to even have a shot at advancing, but the calculus is usually different over a two-legged tie. A team can attempt to grind the opponent down in an attempt to lock their attack out, something Mourinho teams have done time and time again. Benfica's attack-focused approach on Matchday 8 was atypical to their Champions League experiences since Mourinho took over after a Matchday 1 loss to Qarabag – they performed well above their average of 14.1 shots per game and 1.5 expected goals, instead taking 22 shots and generating 3.01 expected goals. Even with the 3-2 defeat to Qarabag factored in, Benfica are a solid defensive side – they have conceded just 10.1 nonpenalty expected goals against in eight games.The question, then, is if this imperfect version of Real Madrid can find a way to break through a tough defense. Even in a season full of ups and downs, it feels hard to bet against the Spanish giants. They rank inside the Champions League's top five for goals with 21 and expected goals with 18.99, their sheer ability to score papering over a handful of cracks. That is especially true since Xabi Alonso's January ouster as the coach, his mission to build a more balanced Real Madrid abandoned despite the progress he made. Since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge, Los Blancos have fully switched to a strategy in which Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior share the field at the same time, kicking the can down the road on the longstanding question about the pair's compatibility.Both in Spain and in Europe, Real Madrid's inherent attacking might is enough to survive their own inconsistencies and notch enough wins to keep them in the conversation for silverware. Mbappe himself is on pace for a career-best season with 39 goals across all competitions so far, while Vinicius has delivered since Arbeloa took charge with four goals and two assists in his last seven matches. Individually, the pair are a cheat code as Los Blancos continue to sort through their issues and will be enough of a challenge for Benfica's defense over the next week and change.The team, though, has received a boost in the return of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who notched his first start since December in Real Madrid's 4-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday. He will provide some attacking balance for a team that is at times overly reliant on Mbappe, already providing a preview of what's to come with an assist over the weekend. The England international is a uniquely creative player as a right back, though his range of passing and positional awareness means he can kickstart an attack from just about every area of the pitch.For all their flaws, Real Madrid have a perfect opportunity to put a sizable loss behind them, even if they are still unwilling to answer the big problems that plague their squad – and their pursuit of trophies, for that matter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n            \n    \n        Green Bay coach Doug Gottlieb went on a rant in his postgame press conference after his team's 75-72 loss at Milwaukee on Sunday. In the tirade, which lasted several uncomfortable minutes, Gottlieb slammed his fists on a table and demanded an explanation from the Horizon League after he was assessed a critical technical foul late in the second half in an eventual one-possession loss.The technical foul came with just under seven minutes remaining in the game and with his Phoenix leading 59-57. Gottlieb defended his actions from the sequence and said nothing he did was enough to warrant a technical, including refraining from cursing and not leaving his coach's box. \"I need the league to explain to me why I got a technical foul when I did not curse, I was not demonstrative, I did not leave my box,\" Gottlieb said. \"All I said was, 'That's the same play as the other end.' All we ask is that it's a fair game. That's all we ask.\"Gottlieb said his issue was not only with the technical, but also with the sequence within the game that eventually led to the technical. From his view, he saw two similar plays with two different outcomes -- both in favor of the other team -- that were officiated differently.\n\"I need Donnie [Ripley] (the Horizon League's Coordinator of Officials) and the new commissioner to explain to me the disparity in the officiating,\" Gottlieb continued. \"You had the exact same play at both ends in the last play of the game. The exact same f****** play. The exact same play. So I need the new commissioner to explain to me what a technical foul is when I don't leave the box, I don't curse, I'm not demonstrative. There was nothing that should've been called a technical foul.\"\nGreen Bay's loss snapped a three-game winning streak and dropped it to 10-7 in league play, putting a .500 finish in conference play on the table.There have been plenty of highs and lows for Green Bay this season -- including an infamous chair-tossing incident from Gottlieb after blowing a double-digit lead -- but it's hard to argue anything other than it's a marked improvement on his first year at the helm of the program. The team finished 4-28 in 2024-25 and at one point endured a 21-game losing streak from late November through mid-February.\nSunday's loss put Green Bay 2.5 games behind league-leading Wright State with three regular-season games remaining, but it's not impossible to think this team could sneak into the NCAA Tournament this year as the league's automatic berth if it wins the Horizon League tourney. Green Bay played Wright State close two weeks ago and defeated Robert Morris on the road in late January.\n            \n    ",

Last season, Hickman started all 17 games and totaled 103 tackles, one tackle for loss and two interceptions.\nPrior to his NFL career, Hickman was a standout with the Buckeyes. In his three seasons with Ohio State, Hickman made 157 total tackles, intercepted three passes and scored a defensive touchdown. In 2021, Hickman earned second-team All-Big Ten honors, and he was named to the third-team in 2022.\n            \n    ",

The Wolverines are once again the undisputed powerhouse in college basketball after a week in which they picked up dominant wins against Northwestern and UCLA. It has now been well beyond a month since Michigan suffered its last loss on Jan. 10 against Wisconsin. In 10 games since, the Wolverines are beating their opponents by an average of 16.5 points per game. That type of dominance alone befits a No. 1 team in the nation, but Michigan's ascendance was helped, in part, by Arizona's first real stumbles of the year. The previously undefeated Wildcats dropped to No. 4 in the Coaches Poll after suffering their first two losses of the season to No. 12 Kansas and No. 13 Texas Tech. Arizona is still positioned well to snag a top four seed nationally once the NCAA Tournament rolls around. Elsewhere in the Big 12, Houston continued to climb ahead of a big week for the Cougars. Houston jumped past Arizona to No. 2 ahead of a monumental clash against No. 6 Iowa State Monday night. Houston also meets Arizona Saturday as the Cougars look to take a commanding lead in the Big 12 race. Here's a look at the Feb. 16 Coaches Poll in its entirety.First-place votes in parenthesis\nCoaches Poll Michigan (31) HoustonDukeArizonaUConnIowa StatePurdueGonzagaNebraskaIllinoisFloridaKansasTexas TechVirginiaMichigan State St. John's ArkansasVanderbiltSaint LouisNorth CarolinaLouisvilleBYU Miami (OH) ClemsonWisconsin Others receiving votes: Alabama 32; Villanova 30; Utah State 20; Tennessee 19; Iowa 7; Kentucky 6; Saint Mary's 2; Miami (FL) 1\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A day like today was always coming for the Dolphins. Maybe it was before the season. Maybe it was when they started 0-3, or when wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered a brutal knee injury in Week 4, or when they fired GM Chris Grier and sold at the trade deadline. When they benched Tua Tagovailoa and, a few weeks later, fired coach Mike McDaniel, the writing was officially on the wall.The Dolphins, as we knew them for the past four seasons, were a thing of the past, and their roster teardown began in earnest Monday when they released Hill, edge rusher Bradley Chubb, offensive lineman James Daniels and wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.Hill and Chubb are the headliners. When the Dolphins were at their best, making the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, so, too, was Hill. He had 1,710 receiving yards in 2022 and 1,799 in 2023. He not only became the first player in NFL history with 1,700+ yards in multiple seasons, but he did it in consecutive seasons. Miami's offense hummed along; it led the NFL in yards and was second in points in 2023.Chubb was part of the effort to elevate the defense to, if not a similar level, at least a viable level. The Dolphins sent a first-round pick to the Broncos in 2022 and signed Chubb to a five-year, $110 million extension. The Dolphins made the playoffs in 2022 and 2023, with Chubb racking up 11 sacks and a league-leading six forced fumbles in the latter.\n\n        \n            \n                Tyreek Hill landing spots: Chiefs, Bills and other AFC contenders among top fits after Dolphins release WR\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe excitement came to an end even faster that it had arrived, a tale as old as time in the NFL. The Dolphins' playoff duds revealed serious flaws. Tagovailoa struggled with concussions. Chubb missed the entire 2024 season with a torn ACL. Miami missed the postseason each of the last two seasons.Now, new GM Jon-Eric Sullivan and new coach Jeff Hafley -- both from the Packers -- are turning over a new leaf. Monday's releases clear $56 million in 2026 cap space, per NFL Media. That duo still has much to do, though.The fact that Sullivan comes from Green Bay shouldn't be lost. The Packers once moved on from a veteran quarterback and didn't skip a beat. They built the NFL's youngest roster and loaded it with talent.\nDon't expect a similar path in the immediate future from Miami, which is in a very different spot. Miami can begin to dig itself out of its mess this offseason, but this is very much a multiyear project. Here are the first steps.Figure out Tua Tagovailoa's futureThis is the elephant in the room. Last week, Sullivan said the Dolphins were \"getting close\" on a decision regarding the embattled quarterback, and he has previously said the team would look at all options at quarterback this offseason.The expectation is that the Dolphins move on. It's much easier said than done. As Jordan Dajani wrote earlier this month:\nThe former No. 5 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft signed a four-year, $212.4 million extension prior to the 2024 season after a career year. Trading Tagovailoa would be ideal, but Miami would have to eat a chunk of the $54 million guaranteed salary he has in 2026. Plus, there would be a $45.2 million dead cap hit if Tagovailoa is traded before June 1 as well. It would appear a cut is more likely, but that has ramifications, too.Tagovailoa release with post-June 1 designation (via Spotrac) 2026 dead cap$67,400,0002027 dead cap$31,800,0002026 savings$-11,132,353Parting ways with Tagovailoa would leave 2025 sixth-rounder Cam Miller (originally drafted by the Raiders) and 2025 seventh-rounder Quinn Ewers as the only quarterbacks under contract for the 2026 season.\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: Tua Tagovailoa, A.J. Brown among 15 players who could be traded or released in 2026 offseason\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFigure out quarterback plans for 2026 (and beyond?)The name that comes up most often with Tagovailoa's impending departure is Russell Wilson. In 2024, the Broncos released Wilson, incurring a $53 million dead cap hit. That's still the record; Tagovailoa's $67.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 would shatter it.Sullivan and Hafley have a blank canvas here. Ewers looked like a seventh-round rookie playing out the string last year. If they want to give him another year -- or see what they have in Miller -- they could, but it would likely mean they're punting on the season. Since the NFL Draft shrunk to seven rounds in 1994, only one rookie drafted in the seventh round won double-digit games in his second year or earlier: Brock Purdy. If Sullivan and Hafley believe they have the next Purdy (and the next Kyle Shanahan in offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik), more power to them. In all likelihood, neither Ewers nor Miller is the answer.One of the main reasons the Broncos were able to rebound from the Wilson disaster is they had the 12th pick in the quarterback-rich 2024 draft. They selected Bo Nix and, alongside coach Sean Payton and a strong defense, emerged as one of the NFL's top teams in short order.The Dolphins don't have the luxury of a quarterback-rich draft. Fernando Mendoza is the only surefire first-round quarterback; the 2024 class had six quarterbacks in the top 12. Miami could opt for a mid-round quarterback if Sullivan and co. find one they like.Before that, though, the Dolphins will have opportunities in free agency. The most obvious tie is Malik Willis, who played well in relief of Jordan Love in Green Bay. Willis is a wild card in this class. Is he viewed as a bridge quarterback or one worthy of a sizable long-term contract? His play in Green Bay was admirable; it also came in very small doses and under a premier offensive mind in Matt LaFleur. If Sullivan and Hafley want to reunite with Willis, it will have to be at a cost that isn't prohibitive given the incoming financial implications of the Tagovailoa departure.Other options include a veteran who could provide a viable baseline -- think Wilson, Joe Flacco or Marcus Mariota -- or a trade for a low-end starter, like Mac Jones. Sullivan might be reticent to give up draft capital, though, and that would make sense given the situation.The best path forward could be a combination of sorts: a veteran plus a mid-round pick, neither of whom would preclude them from drafting a quarterback in 2027, when the quarterback pool is projected to be much stronger.Improve the trenches and the defensive secondaryIn a significant win for the Dolphins, Aaron Brewer came out of nowhere to be one of the NFL's premier centers in 2025. A second-team All-Pro, Brewer is 28 and has one more year left on his deal. He will be a key holdover for Miami in its new era. Left tackle Patrick Paul, a 2024 second-round pick, showed significant improvement in his second year, too.Around them, though, are major questions. Left guard Jonah Savaiinaea, a second-round pick in 2025, struggled mightily as a rookie. Right guard Cole Strange was marginally better. Right tackle Larry Borom was OK.\n2025 Dolphins OLPFF rankLT Patrick Paul43rd out of 84 OTsLG Jonah Savaiinaea79th out of 79 OGsC Aaron Brewer2nd out of 37 CsRG Cole Strange57th out of 79 OGsRT Larry Borom58th out of 84 OTsAn upgrade or two would help whomever plays quarterback in 2026 as well as De'Von Achane, who figures to be a fulcrum after a breakout 2025.The Dolphins have now moved on from both Chubb and Jaelan Phillips (traded to the Eagles at the deadline), two edge rushers who looked to be a significant part of Miami's future just a few months ago. Again, things change quickly in the NFL. Miami would love to see a bounce-back campaign from 2024 first-round pick Chop Robinson and a major leap from 2025 first-round pick Kenneth Grant. Absent those developments, there's a dearth of young talent on the defensive front -- another imposing challenge moving forward.The Dolphins could also use upgrades in the secondary around Minkah Fitzpatrick, who continues to provide solid play, if not his previous All-Pro level. Cornerback will be a major area of focus after injuries derailed the group in 2025.\nRealize it won't all happen in one yearLet's go back to the 2024 Broncos. As outlined above, this isn't the 2024 class at quarterback. The 2026 Dolphins also won't be the 2024 Broncos when it comes to young talent. Denver had three All-Pro defenders in cornerback Patrick Surtain II (the Defensive Player of the Year), edge rusher Nik Bonitto and defensive lineman Zach Allen. All were in their age-27 season or younger. If the Dolphins have one young defender become an All-Pro in 2026, it'd be a significant success in the short and long terms.One of the worst things an NFL team can do is lie to itself about where it is. Sullivan and Hafley need and deserve a long runway, and they need to use every inch of it. This is a roster in a bad spot in terms of current talent and means to acquire it. That's what happens when a $212 million bet on a quarterback goes bust, and the roster was already in a tenuous spot.Miami has its own first- and second-round picks and three third-round picks. That's five picks in the top 90. Before they even get there, though, they owe it to themselves to find the right free agent crop.\nIt doesn't have to be the \"best\" crop -- and it won't be. But it needs to be the right crop. Veterans who can establish a solid, dependable baseline and foster a culture for the youngsters. Swings on players in or approaching their primes who needed a change of scenery.Rome wasn't built in a day; Miami's new era won't be either. But with a smart, measured approach to free agency, hits in the draft and internal development, the Dolphins can gradually build toward a bright future -- something they haven't had in several years.\n            ",

The move, announced by the team on Monday, comes ahead of contract guarantees that take effect during the 2026 season. Hill suffered a devastating, season-ending knee injury in September and is expected to miss much of the offseason in recovery.Hill's extension signed last offseason was worth $90 million, with a final year cap hit of nearly $52 million. It was mostly served to increase the average annual salary mark that is used as the most common metric for ranking player salaries.\"The 2026 contract year has $29.9 million in non-guaranteed base salary, including $11 million in guaranteed salary if Hill is on the roster on the third day of the 2026 league year,\" CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones wrote earlier this offseason. \"A $5 million roster bonus is due on the same day, meaning that the Dolphins would guarantee Hill $16 million if he's on the roster come March 14. Because the final year was mostly cosmetic, the final year of the contract did not include money that would guarantee in the event of injury.\"Hill's fourth season in Miami ended with 21 catches for 265 yards and a touchdown, this coming after his production in 2024 was the lowest of his career.\nThe Dolphins hired Jeff Hafley as their new coach in January, moving on from Mike McDaniel. By releasing Hill before June 1, the Dolphins take a $28.2 million dead cap hit in 2026.Hill, 31, recently said in an interview with People that he is walking without a brace. Hill, who in September was accused several domestic violence-related incidents by his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, has not hinted at retirement despite the injury and off-the-field items.\n\"My focus right now is just playing ball and spending time with my kids and just doing what I'm best at: providing for my family,\" Hill said at the time. \"So all the noise, I feel like if you allow that kind of stuff to get in the way of what you're trying to do, it can only cloud what you're really trying to get accomplished.\"\n            \n    ",

Los Blancos aim to correct course in a season full of ups and downs, anchored by an in-form Kylian Mbappe and Vinciius Junior and boosted by the long-awaited return of Trent Alexander-Arnold during his injury-plagued first season in Madrid.Elsewhere in Europe, reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain resume their title defense with a two-legged tie against fellow Ligue 1 side Monaco.

Inter have looked very, very good lately but anything can happen in knockout football, particularly when the first leg takes place in such trying circumstances.  Pardeep Cattry: Juventus -- Juventus have undoubtedly improved since bringing in Luciano Spalletti as the coach last fall, keeping themselves competitive in a fiercely-contested battle for a top four berth in Serie A. Their imperfections are hard to miss, though -- Weston McKennie's impressive form is a highlight but Juventus are currently a bit porous in defense, which could hamper their chances of making their deepest Champions League run in four years. Galatasaray struggled at times during the league phase, but they tend to hold their own at home and boast two reliable goalscorers in Victor Osimhen and Mauro Icardi. It makes Juventus particularly vulnerable in the knockout phase playoffs, progression no sure thing even if they are the favorites.  Francesco Porzio: Atalanta -- The Italian team is the favourite to make it to the knockout stages against Borussia Dortmund, but will need to be extra careful especially in the first leg that will be played away in Germany. The side coached by Raffaele Palladino is considered one of the best teams of the playoffs and come from three wins in a row against Lazio, Cremonese and Juventus in the Coppa Italia quarterfinals.   Chuck Booth: Juventus -- It may be a stretch calling Juventus favorites, but RAMS Park is one of the toughest places in the world to play. This is a Juve side that has been playing uncharacteristically fun soccer these days, but they're far from consistent, which is where Victor Oshiemen and Galatasaray can make something happen. If Juve leaves this game behind on aggregate, it could be hard to find a way back.\n Underdogs that will get into the round of 16 James Benge: Galatasaray -- Should a team with Victor Osimhen in it be considered underdogs? Perhaps only because Galatasaray have drawn a quite impressive opponent in Juventus. Okan Buruk's side have been flying lately in the domestic game and have already gotten impressive results against Liverpool and Atletico Madrid at home.   Pardeep Cattry: Galatasaray -- Three wins in the league phase does not make for the most impressive record, especially when they came against an out-of-form Liverpool and two inferior opponents in Bodo/Glimt and Ajax, but Galatasaray have always been well-positioned to punch above their weight in a competition like this one. The aforementioned Icardi and Osimhen have 15 goals each across all competitions, the pair alone offering enough might to make things interesting against Juventus, though they have star quality in other areas of the pitch, too. The odds make it improbable -- they have not reached the Champions League round of 16 since the 2013-14 -- but if there's any tie that has upset watch written all over it, it's this one.  Francesco Porzio: Club Brugge -- The Belgian team was probably one of the biggest disappointments of the league phase but at the end managed to qualify for the playoffs. They will face Atletico Madrid and despite being less competitive, the Spanish giants are not living their best season under Diego Simeone and recently lost 3-0 against Rayo Vallecano over the weekend, underlining the issues they are currently facing.   Chuck Booth: Qarabag -- The Azerbaijani side may have cooled off after their hot start to league phase play, but facing a Newcastle United side who are dealing with fixture congestion and one of the longest trips that any team will take during UCL play. That much travel and the pressure of being a Premier League side can lead to upsets, which is something that Eddie Howe will have to watch out for. Team that most needed a bye, yet has to play the playoff James Benge: Newcastle -- If nothing else, can you imagine how embarrassing it is turning up to the next Premier League meeting when you're the only team who didn't get top eight in the league phase? Lads, even Tottenham did that. A 5,000 mile round trip to Baku could scarcely come at a worse time for injury addled Newcastle, who had to dig deep to beat Aston Villa in the FA Cup and will have to keep one eye on Saturday night's game at Manchester City.  Pardeep Cattry: PSG -- The reigning champions have all the tools they need to succeed and boast a favorable tie against Monaco, who have been in middling form in Ligue 1 and the Champions League this season. Paris Saint-Germain, though, enter the knockout phase playoffs in the midst of a rough patch -- they have won just four of their last eight, a run of form that saw them knocked out of the Coupe de France, fail to break into the Champions League's top eight and slip to second in Ligue 1. If anyone can turn things around, it's Luis Enrique's team, but the onus is on them to snap out of their funk in order to do so.  Francesco Porzio: AS Monaco -- The French only won two of the eight games played in the league phase of the Champions League and despite that qualified as the 21th team in the standings. For this reason they will now meet PSG in the playoffs, one of the most difficult matchups they could possibly imagine.   Chuck Booth: Borussia Dortmund -- Faced with one of the toughest matchups in the entire knockout phase, you may not know what you'll get from Atalanta on a day-to-day basis, but they'll give Dortmund all they can handle in these two legs. The German side will expect to make it to the round of 16 due to their success going deep in this competition in previous years, but getting the toughest draw that they could, won't make it easy.\n Playoff team most likely to win it all James Benge: PSG -- The form and particularly fitness that Luis Enrique found at the back end of last season hasn't really returned to PSG for any consistent run of games. When it has, however, this has still proven itself to be a team who can blitz the best that Ligue 1 has to offer, except for some weirdness against Rennes. There is no reason to think that they don't at least belong among the top three favorites to win the Champions League.   Pardeep Cattry: PSG -- Sure, they may not be at their best at this exact moment but the shine of their hisotric treble has not actually worn off PSG. They have been unlucky at times during their recent skid, a signal that they can still hack it amongst Europe's elites as long as they end the streak of inconsistency. The knockout phase playoff tie against Monaco offers a great chance for them to reset but even if they progress in unideal circumsntaces, the teams that await them should discount them at their own risk.  Francesco Porzio: PSG -- The 2024-25 Champions League winners are finally back at their usual level. The French giants are at the top of the Ligue 1 standings and they are gaining their best form after a challenging first part of the season. They are reaching their best form when it counts.Chuck Booth: PSG -- We're unanimous here for a reason. The reigning champions of this competition, there's no reason why PSG can't win it again. When Ousmane Dembele has been on the pitch, this is one of the best teams in the world. They've had to spend more time without him than anyone would prefer, but if PSG are able to get through this round and get healthier as a squad, look out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Now that the preliminary round of the men's hockey tournament at the 2026 Winter Olympics is complete, the playoff round is about to begin. And as expected with NHL players participating in the Winter Games for the first time since 2014, Canada and the United States are the cream of the crop in the sport.The two superpowers were the only teams to win all three of their round-robin games and received a bye, along with Slovakia and defending Olympic champions Finland, to the quarterfinals. Their opponents will be determined on Tuesday when the remaining eight nations compete in the qualification round.Top seed Canada will face the winner of the matchup between Czechia and Denmark, while a meeting with No. 2 seed Team USA is on the line when Sweden takes on Latvia. No. 3 Slovakia will battle either Germany or France, and No. 4 Finland awaits the survivor of the showdown between Switzerland and Italy.The qualification winners will have little time to recover as the quarterfinals take place Wednesday. The semifinals are scheduled for Friday, with the losers facing off for the bronze medal the following day and the winners playing for gold on Sunday.Teams will be reseeded after the quarterfinals based on the preliminary round rankings, meaning Canada and the U.S. won't clash until a medal is at stake, if at all. Considering how they breezed through their round-robin contests, it's very likely they'll be squaring off for gold.Canada is the overwhelming favorite to claim its record 10th Olympic gold medal and first since 2014 as it is priced at -140 at most major sportsbooks. Team USA is listed between +195 and +220, while no other team is priced below +1000.Below are my predictions for medals in the 2026 Winter Olympics men's hockey tournament, as well as the teams' current odds to earn a spot on the podium at DraftKings Sportsbook.

Widely regarded as the best player on the planet, Connor McDavid has not disappointed in his first Olympics as he leads the tournament with nine points. The 29-year-old captain of the Edmonton Oilers has more assists (seven) than any other player has points (six). Teammates Sidney Crosby and Macklin Celebrini both have recorded six points, along with Slovakia's Juraj Slafkovsky, while the 19-year-old Celebrini is tied with Germany's Tim Stutzle for first in the Winter Games with four goals. Crosby and defenseman Drew Doughty helped Canada win gold in 2010 and 2014 while goaltender Jordan Binnington backstopped the club to the 4 Nations Face-Off title last year. Binnington, who guided the St. Louis Blues to the Stanley Cup championship as a rookie in 2019, won both of his starts in these Olympics - including a 26-save shutout against Czechia, the Canadians' potential opponent in the quarterfinals. Canada is -140 to win the gold medal at DraftKings, and the team hasn't given me a reason to expect anything less.Get $100 in bonus bets at FanDuel Sportsbook for Winter Olympics betting:Silver - United States (-350 to win a medal)Team USA also went undefeated in the preliminary round but didn't do so as convincingly as Canada. The Americans faced a bit of a scare in their 6-3 victory against Denmark as they trailed by a goal after one period and led by just one after 40 minutes. Captain Auston Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk have registered five points apiece for the U.S., with the former leading the club with three goals and all of the latter's points being assists. Three-time Vezina Trophy winner and reigning Hart Trophy recipient Connor Hellebuyck has turned aside 40 of the 42 shots he faced in these Winter Games but will be in for his toughest test yet if Sweden defeats Latvia in the qualification round as expected. Team USA would then have to record one more victory before a potential showdown with Canada for the gold medal and I just don't see it getting past McDavid, Crosby and company for its first Olympic title since 1980.Bronze - Finland (-155 to win a medal)Finland has one of the most balanced rosters in the Winter Games. All but two of Finland's 22 skaters have recorded a point in the tournament, and neither of them appeared in all three games. Eleven players have scored at least one goal and there's a four-way tie for the team lead of four points. Kaapo Kakko and Joel Armia each have netted two tallies and set up two others, while Sebastian Aho, Mikael Granlund and Joel Kiviranta also have scored twice. Juuse Saros has played every minute in goal for the Finns and has allowed a total of one goal over his last two outings. Finland's quarterfinal opponent will likely be Switzerland, which should get past an Italian squad that gave Slovakia a tough time in the preliminary round but was demolished 11-0 by the Finns in its last contest. The Finns were upset 4-1 by the Slovakians in their Olympic opener, which cost them the top seed in their group, but rebounded by defeating Sweden by the same score and trouncing Italy. Sweden and Czechia will meet the two juggernauts should they advance to the quarterfinals and while it's not out of the realm of possibility that the Swedes upset the Americans, I believe Finland and Slovakia join Canada and the U.S. in the semifinals and ultimately battle for the bronze. I'd give Saros the edge over Samuel Hlavaj in goal, meaning the Finns medal for the seventh time in the last nine Winter Olympics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture, including the Daytona 500. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $100 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet, Win or LoseCBSSPORTS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel and DraftKings require a user's first bet to win, while bet365 provides bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets, but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook that consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there are season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

    "body": "\nEvery night in the Big 12 conference feels like a heavyweight title bout. In the last week alone, the conference has given the country Arizona vs. Kansas, Texas Tech vs. Arizona and Kansas vs. Iowa State.On Monday night, the Big 12 will stage another scintillating showdown when the No. 2 Houston Cougars and the No. 6 Iowa State Cyclones collide at Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Iowa.The Cougars (23-2, 11-1 in Big 12) lead the Big 12 by one game over Arizona (23-2, 10-2). They have won six in a row behind freshman guard Kingston Flemings and a suffocating defense that ranks second in the country with 61.3 points per game allowed. Meanwhile, the Cyclones (22-3, 9-3) are tied for third in the Big 12. They are coming off an 18-point blowout win over Kansas on Saturday, which was their biggest victory over the Jayhawks since 1973. The win also improved Iowa State's home record to 14-0 this season. The Cyclones are 2.5-point favorites over the Cougars on Monday.While Houston vs. Iowa State is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a partial college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Feb. 16. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchSyracuse at No. 3 DukeTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Durham, N.C. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 142.5\nThe Duke Blue Devils continue their march to the ACC regular season title when they host the Syracuse Orange on Monday at Cameron Indoor Stadium. The Blue Devils (23-2, 12-1 in ACC) lead the conference by one game over Virginia (22-3, 10-2). Duke is anchored by likely national player of the year Cameron Boozer, who ranks fifth in the country in scoring (22.8 points per game) and 14th in rebounding (9.9 per game). On Monday, he and the Blue Devils will take on a Syracuse team that has been relatively mediocre defensively this season, ranking 130th in the nation in points per game allowed (72.2). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says there's a 73% chance the teams combine for 143 points or more and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 142.5.No. 2 Houston at No. 6 Iowa StateTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 134.5 | Expert: Houston +2.5 (Micah Roberts)\nBecause both of these teams are known for their defenses, the offenses have been overshadowed. The Cougars rank 12th in the country in offensive rating (125.0 points per 100 possessions), according to KenPom, while the Cyclones (123.9) are 17th. Both teams feature players who can fill it up. Flemings (16.4 points per game) is on pace to break the program record for single-season scoring average by a freshman. Meanwhile, Iowa State's Milan Momcilovic leads the country in 3-point percentage (51.6). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's an 80.4% chance the teams combine for 135 points or more and gives a \"B\" grade to Over 134.5. Looking aheadChampions League: Atalanta at Borussia DortmundTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Dortmund | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 2.5 | Expert: Over 2.5 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo teams on a roll square off in the first leg of a Champions League knockout phase playoff when Borussia Dortmund and Atalanta face off at Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund have won their last six matches in the Bundesliga to move into second place in the table. Atalanta, which installed Raffaele Palladino as coach midseason, have six wins and two draws over their last eight matches in Serie A. \"My belief is that with this being a two-legged playoff, Dortmund are going to press heavily at home in this first leg, knowing that playing in Italy is going to be tough,\" Eimer says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It projects 3.3 total goals and assigns a \"B\" grade to Over 2.5.Paris Saint-Germain at MonacoTime: 3 p.m. Tuesday | Location: Monaco | TV: Paramount+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: PSG -188 | Expert: PSG -1 (Jon Eimer)\nTwo French sides will meet in European competition for the first time when Monaco host PSG at Stade Louis II. PSG sit in second place in the Ligue 1 table with 51 points, behind only Lens (52). Monaco are eighth with 31 points. At the end of November, Monaco stunned PSG 1-0 in a Ligue 1 match in Monaco. But the reigning league champions currently lead Ligue 1 in both goals (49) and goal differential (+30). \"PSG will be desperate for the chance to correct that abysmal 1-0 loss,\" Eimer says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. Its simulations say the average score for this match is 3.7-0.7 and gives a strong \"A\" grade to the PSG money line (-188). \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The juiced-up DraftKings promo code now gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, and although there's no football to wager on today, the model still finds value in some of the NBA's top matchups for online sports betting. Arguably, the game of the day in the NBA is the Detroit Pistons hosting the New York Knicks in a matchup of the two teams with the best records in the Eastern Conference. Despite the Pistons being home and having a better record, the SportsLine advanced computer model is backing the Knicks as 2.5-point favorites as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Knicks vs. Pistons is 232.5, down three from the opening line. The model is also backing the Clippers to defeat the Warriors. One of SportsLine's top experts also has an NHL pick on the New York Rangers vs. Utah Mammoth on Monday. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 12 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 33-15 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookKnicks (-2.5) vs. PistonsRangers (-118) vs. MammothClippers (-102) vs. WarriorsCombining the model's three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +604 (risk $100 to win $604, odds subject to change). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nKnicks (-2.5) vs. Pistons (-108)The Knicks have lost three straight games, but before their most recent skid, New York went 15-3, including its NBA Cup Final victory over the Spurs. Josh Hart (ankle) and Landry Shamet (shoulder) remain out for the Knicks, but no Karl-Anthony Towns or Mitchell Robinson on the injury report is promising. The Knicks have the No. 4 scoring offense (120.6 points per game this season). New York defeated the Pistons in six games in the playoffs last year, including going 3-0 and clinching the series in Detroit, so the road environment shouldn't be an issue on Monday. The model projects the Knicks to cover in 56% of simulations. Back the Knicks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Rangers (-118) vs. MammothThe Rangers haven't been great at home, but Utah is well under .500 away,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"And certainly the Blueshirts have the superior goalie in Igor Shesterkin. The Russian has helped New York on a 6-1-1 run, and after winning the Winter Classic in Miami, he has one or fewer goals in eight games this season, tied for fourth-most in the league.\" Back the Rangers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers (-102) vs. WarriorsThe Clippers are coming off a bad 146-115 loss to the Celtics on Saturday, but they had a six-game winning streak before that contest, including victories over the Pistons, Lakers and Rockets. The Clippers have rebounded from their awful start to give themselves a chance at competing for an NBA Play-In tournament spot if they keep playing as they have over the last few weeks. The Clippers are just 12-22 this season, but they are home on Monday, and they've gone 5-1 over their last six home games. James Harden and Kawhi Leonard still make a top duo in the league for Los Angeles, and Leonard is averaging 38.8 ppg over his last four contests. The Warriors are 2-3 over their last five road games, and 8-12 away on the season. The model projects the Clippers to win in 64% of simulations, showcasing strong value at near even-money odds. Back the Clippers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA, NHL picks for Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Welcome to UFC's Paramount Era. Starting in 2026, all UFC live events will stream on Paramount+, including the end of pay-per-views, as even numbered UFC events will stream for just the cost of a Paramount+ subscription.This change might mean you've become interested in watching UFC fights for the first time. There are decades of history for the promotion, ranging from the earliest days of a \"wild west\" approach to fight promotion to the current status as a global brand that presents more than 40 events and hundreds of fights every year.With that in mind, it's a huge ask to dig through the more than 8,000 fights that have taken place in the Octagon to find the fights that best exemplify the ideals of a UFC fight, so we took it upon us to create a playlist to introduce you to the sport.Let's take a look at a curated list of the 10 best fights to introduce you to what action inside the Octagon looks like at its most exciting. We kept it to one fight per fighter to give the broadest taste of the sport, and of the fighters who have paved the way to the Paramount+ Era.\nForrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar, The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale (April 9, 2005)What better place to start the playlist than with the fight UFC CEO Dana White credits with saving the UFC? The Fertittas and White had seen their attempts to grow the UFC stall out when they took a last-ditch shot in the most 2005 way possible: a reality show. \"The Ultimate Fighter\" drew in viewers for the standard reality show drama, but it also allowed those viewers to connect with the type of men who enter into a cage to punch, kick, elbow, knee and twist another's limbs. The whole thing led to the live finale on Spike TV (the same network that aired the weekly episodes) and Griffin and Bonnar meeting in the light heavyweight finals. The two men went to war in a fight that generated a ton of buzz, led to a renewal order for the show on Spike and UFC contracts for both men. While it was briefly trendy for MMA fans to claim the fight wasn't great for lacking high-level techniques, it's a brutal example of the kind of fight that speaks to a primitive part of the brain.\n\nMauricio \"Shogun\" Rua vs. Dan Henderson, UFC 139 (Nov. 19, 2011)UFC signing a deal with FOX was the first domino that fell to produce one of the greatest UFC fights in history. The deal was signed in August, and in early September, UFC announced that the heavyweight championship fight between Junior Dos Santos and Cain Velasquez would headline the first FOX broadcast, moving it from the expected UFC 139 main event. The promotion then announced that Henderson had signed to return to the Octagon and would face Rua in the UFC 139 headliner. What followed was an all-out war that saw momentum swing multiple times, from Henderson nearly scoring a first-round stoppage to Rua mounting and pummelling Henderson to nearly score a late stoppage.\nJon Jones vs. Alexander Gustafsson, UFC 165 (Sept. 21, 2013)Dana White has claimed Jones is the greatest UFC fighter ever. There's certainly a case to be made for Jones in that slot, whether you place him there or not. With only a small handful of exceptions, Jones dominated nearly every opponent in his storied career. One of the men who was able to actually push Jones to the limit was Gustafsson. Gustafsson was brilliant in the early rounds, winning most of the stand-up exchanges and even scoring takedowns. Jones was able to come back in the second half of the fight to eek out a narrow win in the best fight of his career, and one of the best in UFC history.\nRobbie Lawler vs. Rory MacDonald II, UFC 189 (July 11, 2015)The second meeting between Lawler and MacDonald is considered by many to be the best fight in UFC history. Lawler was a beloved fighter for his pure-action style and he found a perfect dance partner in MacDonald. The two had fought in 2013, with Lawler winning a split decision in a solid fight. Less than two years later, with Lawler now the welterweight champion, they battled again in a blood and guts fight that saw both men rocked, cut and continuing to come forward. Lawler vs. MacDonald II is the kind of fight you can't watch without your heart racing and thinking you should watch it again just for the dopamine rush.\nConor McGregor vs. Nate Diaz 1, UFC 196 (March 5, 2016)Check out the full fight now on Paramount+Even if you've never watched a UFC event, you are likely familiar with McGregor. One of the last true breakout UFC superstars, McGregor entered UFC 196 having run through his first seven UFC opponents. In his last fight before the event, McGregor knocked out the legendary Jose Aldo in just 13 seconds to become featherweight champion. A series of events led to venue and card changes before a plan to have McGregor challenge Rafael dos Anjos for the lightweight title, only for dos Anjos to break his foot. McGregor faced replacement opponent Diaz, the winner of Season 5 of The Ultimate Fighter and a fan favorite for his rebellious personality, in McGregor's welterweight debut. McGregor had a solid first round, only for Diaz to shock the world in the second, forcing McGregor to tap out to a rear-naked choke. It's not as \"great\" as the other fights on the list, but the thrill of a shocking upset is a compelling watch in its own way.Cub Swanson vs Doo-ho Choi, UFC 206 (Dec. 10, 2016)It's easy to forget that, at the peak of his career, Swanson defeated the likes of UFC legends Dustin Poirier and Charles Oliveira, among a slew of other talented fighters. Back-to-back losses against Frankie Edgar and Max Holloway knocked Swanson from the ranks of featherweight contenders, but Swanson began to again make the climb as Doo-ho Choi exploded onto the UFC roster with three first-round knockout wins. That all led to a crossroads fight at UFC 206, which Swanson won in an all-action fight to prove he still had plenty in the tank.\nRobert Whittaker vs. Yoel Romero II, UFC 225 (June 9, 2018)Whittaker is another fan favorite fighter, both for his style and his personality. Romero presented a fantastic foil for Whittaker during Whittaker's time as middleweight champion. With an action figure build, which betrayed Romero as he missed weight, thus leaving him unable to win the title at UFC 225, Romero looks like what someone dreams of as a professional fighter. Add in an Olympic silver medal in freestyle wrestling and massive power in his punches and kicks, and Romero is as dangerous as any fighter on any given day. Whittaker managed to navigate all of those dangers against Romero not once, but twice, with their UFC 225 clash as the standout in their rivalry. Romero had to survive Whittaker's clever boxing in the opening rounds before he started to connect with heavy power shots that dropped Whittaker several times. Despite those scary moments, Whittaker survived and took a split decision.\nDustin Poirier vs. Dan Hooker, UFC Fight Night (June 27, 2020)During one of the peak stretches of the COVID-19 pandemic, beloved legend Poirier met a dangerous and rangy fighter in Hooker in the empty UFC Apex. Poirier had lost a shot at the lightweight championship against then-champion Khabib Nurmagomedov and was looking to remain in contention for another shot at the belt against Hooker, who was looking to boost his own resume with a win over a future Hall of Famer. The result was a bloody war that saw Hooker win the early rounds before a gutsy comeback from Poirier over the final stretch.\nWeili Zhang vs. Joanna Jedrzejczyk, UFC 248 (March 7, 2020)Check out the full fight now on Paramount+ Great fights aren't only for men. Since UFC welcomed women to the Octagon in 2013, women have produced a ton of memorable moments and great fights. Arguably, no women's fight has produced the drama, skill and violence of Zhang vs. Jedrzejczyk in 2020. The bell-to-bell action left both women visibly damaged, though it was Jedrzejczyk who ended up with a hematoma on her forehead that remains one of the most striking visuals in MMA history.\nGlover Teixeira vs. Jiri Prochazka, UFC 275 (June 11, 2022)Check out the full fight now on Paramount+Teixeira became one of the great stories of the 2020s when he defeated Jan Blachowicz to win the light heavyweight championship at 42 years old. That was a fantastic moment for one of the sport's most beloved figures. His first title defense came against Prochazka, a unique fighter who combined a samurai mentality with a wide-open attacking style. Prochazka tagged Teixeira with his unorthodox striking throughout the fight, but Teixeira stood tall, landing his own strikes and using takedowns to unleash brutal striking on the ground. Despite the narrative that Prochazka couldn't win the fight if much time was spent on the floor, he only only survived Teixeira's assault, but also finished the fight there, forcing Teixeira to tap to a rear-naked choke with just 28 seconds left in the fight.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There is no organization in the NBA that operates with less transparency from the top than the New York Knicks. Team president Leon Rose doesn't speak at press conferences or answer questions from the external media, and owner James Dolan hadn't done an interview in three years. But all that changed on Monday when Dolan joined his friend Craig Carton on New York's WFAN radio for the launch of \"The Carton Show,\" offering a rare chance to hear about the Knicks from their owner. There were a handful of topics discussed, including whether Rose has a long-term contract with the team -- \"As far as I know, Leon's with us for the long-term\" -- and why Dolan refused to hang a banner for the Knicks winning the NBA Cup -- \"We want an NBA championship. We don't want the consolation prize.\" However there were two topics that came up that were the most interesting to get Dolan's thoughts on: the firing Tom Thibodeau, the first coach to get the Knicks back to the Eastern Conference finals in 25 years, and subsequent hiring of Mike Brown and the rumors of trade talks to bring in Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo. \nDolan on firing Tom Thibodeau\"The team is really built on the shoulders of Tom Thibodeau. He built that core, we went as far as we did last year, so you really gotta take your hat off to Tom and the job that he did. But we did come to the conclusion that we had an idea of how we wanted to organize the team, and actually it goes for both teams [Knicks and Rangers], and that meant we needed to evolve beyond the old traditional coaching formulas, etc. And we tried to work that with Tom and it really wasn't his thing ...\"That's some of it [not using the bench, style of play], but it was much more about style of leadership. Collaboration versus sort of [lone wolf] -- yeah. Because of the way, particularly basketball, is evolving, how much more complicated it is, they're very big on development on both clubs, because you can't -- it's not like the old days, the old Yankees where you get Reggie Jackson and this guy and you put together a team. It's almost impossible to do that in the NBA. You have to home grow some of your talent and that also builds up trade currency, etc. But it's a development thing, and that's a team. It's literally 20 people who are specifically dedicated to developing the players, to getting their skill levels up to getting the strategy on the court in[to games]. And that's important for the development of the franchise. But Tom, he liked development, but he didn't really ... [interrupted by Carton] ...\"I won't say you can't win a title with Tom Thibodeau, I don't think that's true, but if you want to build a long-term, competitive, compete for the … you need somebody who's more of a collaborator than Tom was. But still, you really, Tom is still a great coach. He should coach again in the NBA. If I had a franchise I was just starting with, he would be a gold mine to get. He was like that for us when we first started and he first came in. He brought discipline. He brought strategy. He brought us all that way, but we really felt we needed to make a change to go the rest of the way ...\n\"We talked to Tom all the time, and, look, I don't wanna get too deep into the interaction, but I would say that whole last year we were talking with Tom about where we wanted to go, etc. He would probably tell you that he's stubborn, but he'd also tell you that he's right.\"Dolan on whether Knicks came close to trading for Giannis Antetokounmpo\"Not that I'm aware of. And I think -- look, we love our team right now. They have chemistry, they all like each other. I've never seen a locker room more copacetic. There's a lot of energy in there. Leon can always overrule me, but I don't see us making a big change. We gotta keep building up this group. This group can win a championship. I believe that. \"Look how far we got with our group last year. And then take a look at who was playing and who wasn't playing, and we had injuries. We're going into this season, the second half of the season -- Josh [Hart] is still out and Landry [Shamet] is coming back soon -- we got depth. And if we stay healthy, we'll go into the playoffs in much better condition than we went into the playoffs last year.\"\nMain takeawaysDolan might not always like league rules, but even he knows better than to risk a tampering violation regarding Antetokounmpo, so it's not a surprise that he'd sidestep that topic. That said, he genuinely seems excited about this group and I'm inclined to believe him when he says there aren't plans for any major moves midseason and that they'll see what this group, as constructed, can do. That won't stop Antetokounmpo trade rumors, but it should put them on the back burner for six months. The Thibodeau portion was the most forthcoming part of Dolan's interview and he came across as someone a bit torn by parting ways with the coach who laid the foundation for this team's success. The word he kept coming back to was \"collaborator,\" and while he tried to be careful with his words, it was clear that at some point there was a split internally on how the team should operate to create sustained success and Thibodeau wasn't interested in making the changes the front office wanted. Dolan highlighted the importance of developing talent internally for both on-court reasons and creating more desirable trade assets, and it seems some of the frustration Knicks fans had with Thibodeau's tight rotations that resulted in minimal minutes for younger players was shared by those in charge. Dolan pointed to the depth of the Knicks this year and hoped they would enter the two-month gauntlet of an NBA Finals run better rested, and that starts with the reserves doing more to spell core players. \nThere wasn't as much ground-breaking news in the interview, but the Thibodeau portion was interesting and he at least briefly calmed the Antetokounmpo rumblings. His stance on an NBA Cup banner was perhaps the most controversial for Knicks fans, but also not at all surprising. \n            ",

    "body": "\nAre you ready for some basketball?Now that the NFL regular season is over, fans can turn their attention on Monday night to the NBA. And tonight's showcase game is quite the attraction: the Detroit Pistons battling the New York Knicks in a matchup between the top two teams in the Eastern Conference. The Pistons (26-9) own the best record in the East and the second best record in the entire league. The Knicks (23-12) sit three games behind Detroit but enter the game on a three-game losing streak.Monday's matchup is the first between the teams this season and is a rematch of last year's first-round playoff series, which New York won in six games.This season, the Pistons have the second-best defensive rating in the league (110.6 points per 100 possessions), while the Knicks have the fourth-best offensive rating (120.7). New York is a 2.5-point favorite over Detroit on Monday.While Knicks vs. Pistons is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes seven other NBA games and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Jan. 5. All times Eastern.NBA best bets, where to watchKnicks at PistonsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 232.5 | Expert: Mikal Bridges Under 20.5 total points and assists -120 (Prop Bet Guy)\nNew York's Jalen Brunson enters Monday on a serious heater. During the month of December, Brunson averaged 30.6 points and 7.1 assists per game while shooting 40.5% on 3-pointers. For his efforts, he was named the East's December Player of the Month. On Monday, he will face a Pistons team playing the second half of a back-to-back. On Sunday, Detroit won 114-110 in Cleveland. The SportsLine Projection Model says the teams have a 58.7% chance to combine for 232 points or fewer and assigns a B grade to Under 232.5. Meanwhile, Prop Bet Guy notes that Bridges has gone Under 20.5 total points and assists in 14 of his last 20 games. \"Detroit limits spot-up shooters to the fourth-fewest points and overall allows the fewest assists per game,\" he says.Nuggets at 76ersTime: 8:30 p.m. | Location: Philadelphia | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Nuggets +11.5\nHow's this for a Bizarro World? Oft-injured Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid is probable to play on Monday, while ironman Nuggets star Nikola Jokic (left knee) is out. Denver (23-12) has struggled offensively without Jokic running the show; the Nuggets are averaging just 113.8 points per 100 possessions over their last three games, which is a steep decline from their NBA-leading average of 123.0. Most importantly, they are 1-2 over that stretch. However, two formerly injured starters, forward Aaron Gordon and guard Christian Braun, have returned to the lineup following extended absences. The SportsLine Projection Model says Denver has a 67.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Nuggets +11.5.Warriors at ClippersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Clippers +100\nThe holidays were good to the Clippers' Kawhi Leonard. Over the last two weeks, the 34-year-old two-time NBA champion has rekindled past magic, averaging 36.6 points, 7.7 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.7 steals per game while shooting 51.3% from the field and 41.8% from the 3-point line. That includes a 55-point game against the Pistons on Dec. 28. Most importantly for the team, Los Angeles (12-22) is 6-1 over that stretch. On Monday, the Clippers face a Golden State team that is 6-2 in its last eight games. The SportsLine Projection Model says Los Angeles has a 64.0% chance to win and assigns a strong A grade to Clippers +100.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 10 Nebraska at Ohio StateTime: 6:30 p.m. | Location: Columbus, Ohio | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Ohio State -2.5 | Expert: Ohio St. -115 (Thomas Casale)\nWe certainly live in strange times; the Indiana football team and the Nebraska basketball team are 14-0. The Cornhuskers' start is the best in program history, and after the team's 58-56 win over Michigan State at home on Friday, Nebraska players asked fans to stop storming the court. Huskers fans won't get that chance on Monday; Nebraska will be on the road against Ohio State (10-3). \"The Huskers did win their one true road game at Illinois, but I still think there will be opportunities to bet against them away from home this season and this is one of them,\" Casale says. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Buckeyes have a 66.0% chance to cover and gives a strong A grade to Ohio State -2.5.USC at No. 12 Michigan StateTime: 8:30 p.m. | Location: East Lansing, Mich. | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Michigan State -10.5\nTwo Big Ten teams looking to bounce back from a loss will square off when the Michigan State Spartans (12-2, 2-1 in Big Ten) host the USC Trojans (12-2, 1-2) at the Breslin Center. The Trojans are licking their wounds after getting blown out at No. 2 Michigan, 96-66. Meanwhile, the Spartans are coming off that 58-56 loss at Nebraska that prompted the court storming. But Michigan State still ranks fifth in the country in defensive rating (92.2 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Spartans have a 55.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Michigan State -10.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After his benching and later demotion to third-string with the New York Giants this season, Russell Wilson is planning on giving it another go in 2026 with a new team. The 10-time Pro Bowl quarterback and free agent-to-be said Monday his is not considering retirement following his 14th season in the NFL.\"I'm not blinking,\" Wilson said, via SNY. \"I know what I'm capable of. I think I showed that in Dallas, and I want to be able to do that again. You know, and just be ready to rock and roll, and be as healthy as possible and be ready to play ball.\"Wilson signed a one-year, $10.5 million deal that had double that amount in incentives tied to performance and playoffs. Then-coach Brian Daboll and the Giants named Wilson the unquestioned starter at the time of his signing and that continued despite selecting former Ole Miss standout Jaxson Dart in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft.Through an 0-3 start, New York's offense was sinking, ranked 27th in points despite being 12th in yards gained through three weeks. Wilson's passer rating sat at 78.5, the lowest of his career, and forced Daboll's hand to go with Dart.\nThe 37-year-old vet said Monday he played with an injury this season.\"You know, I played that (Week 2) game, you know, I tore my hamstring on Friday in practice -- the last play of practice. And I had a Grade 2 (tear). I couldn't tell anybody. I had to go and play on it just because I knew the circumstance, I had to play on it, no matter what,\" Wilson said. \"I actually ended up going to the Dallas Mavericks' facility, training. And, you know, kept it quiet, just trying to get treatment on it and just knowing that I probably couldn't run from the goal line to the 10-yard line if I wanted to, but I feel like, you know, I got to play this game.\"Potential landing spotsThe likelihood of Wilson being a premiere starter next season is slim, but there are several teams with varying quarterback situations in need of help -- assistance he could provide in a backup role or potentially with first-team reps.The New York Jets don't have a QB1 coming out of the 2025 season after benching Justin Fields in November for Tyrod Taylor. After a 2-8 start, Taylor went 1-5 over the Jets' final stretch in games he started.\nIn CBS Sports' latest 2026 NFL Mock Draft, Mike Renner has the Jets selecting Oregon signal caller Dante Moore at No. 2 overall, behind the Las Vegas, who are also expected to go quarterback with their top selection.The Cleveland Browns fired coach Kevin Stefanski on Monday, which means general manager Andrew Berry and the new coaching staff have decisions to make within their quarterback room without a justifiable starter. That group consists of Shedeur Sanders, Dillon Gabriel and a costly Deshaun Watson, who signed a five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract in March 2022 and has only made 19 starts since -- a result of NFL suspension and several injuries.Perhaps the Kansas City Chiefs and Wilson would be a marriage that works, at least temporarily until Patrick Mahomes is ready to return from the field following his torn ACL. For now, backup Gardner Minshew, who also tore his ACL, isn't under contract for next season and neither is practice-squad quarterback Chris Oladokun. \nWilson and his agent may have to wait until after the draft shakes out in a few months to see which teams have a spot available and decide on options -- or at least where interest is mutual.Six seasons removed from his NFL-best 40 touchdown passes for the Seattle Seahawks in 2020, the former Super Bowl champion was effective in Denver during the 2023 campaign but has played below his career QBR avg. of 99.3 the last four years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Calls for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to make a coaching change were amplified when the team squandered a clear path to the playoffs and finished the 2025 season with seven losses in nine games. With the campaign now complete, coach Todd Bowles said he has not yet met with team ownership and made a public case as to why he should retain his job.Four teams canned their coaches in the first 24 hours following the end of the regular season. Bowles said his track record speaks for itself as to why he should not join that group.\"All I can do is coach and be myself,\" Bowles said on Monday. \"I've earned the chance. I've won three straight division titles, so that says a lot, as far as I'm concerned. But I don't really have a message for fans other than true fans are true fans. We're going to try and do our best to go out there and win for them. They're going to feel how they feel. That's not the coach's problem. The coach's problem is to make the team better. That's all I'm looking forward to.\"The second half of the season eliminated some of the goodwill Bowles built with the Buccaneers fanbase throughout the prolific three-year run to start his tenure. Tampa Bay opened at 6-2 but finished the campaign below .500 after rattling off two separate losing streaks of at least three games. It won just twice since October.According to CBS Sports' NFL insider Jonathan Jones, the losing season is unlikely to spell the end of the Bowles era in Tampa. The Buccaneers awarded Bowles a three-year contract extension last offseason. Changes to the assistant coaching staff, however, could be in store for a franchise that seeks to get back to the postseason as quickly as next year.\n\"I understand their frustrations, and I understand our own frustrations, as well,\" Bowles said. \"It's well warranted and well warranted within the building, as well.\"Reasons for optimism as Bowles enters Year 5Barring an ouster in the coming days, Bowles will gear up for his fifth year at the helm in search of a bounce-back run to the NFC South title. The division's shortcomings should be a source of optimism for Buccaneers fans, who just watched their team rattle off three consecutive NFC South titles. The Carolina Panthers won the division this season with a losing record, and neither them nor the Atlanta Falcons or New Orleans Saints project as powerhouses in the immediate future.Bowles has taken Tampa Bay to the playoffs more often than not, and with his current roster construction, he should be squarely in the mix to do so again in 2026.\nThe offense has all of the tools it needs to run the division with a young and talented supporting cast around Baker Mayfield. Wide receivers Emeka Egbuka, Tez Johnson and Jalen McMillan give the Buccaneers a youthful trio, and if Mike Evans re-signs and Chris Godwin stays healthy next year, they should round out one of the NFL's top receiving units. Standout running back Bucky Irving will also be back.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- If there's one area to blame when it comes to the Dallas Cowboys' 7-9-1 2025 season that resulted in the team missing the playoffs for the second year in a row, it's the defense.Dallas' offense averaged 27.7 points per game, the seventh-best in the NFL, but the defense allowed 30.1 points per game, the most in the league and the second-most points per game allowed in the 66-season history of the Cowboys. Only Dallas' inaugural 1960 squad that finished 0-11-1 was a worse scoring defense than the 2025 unit, allowing 30.8 points per game. The lack of defensive production this season came in defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' first season in this capacity for Dallas and All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons' first season away from the Cowboys. Owner/general manager Jerry Jones traded him away a week before the season began and didn't make any big moves to compensate for that loss until acquiring former All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams from the New York Jets at the NFL trade deadline during the Cowboys' Week 10 bye. Williams racked up 32 quarterback pressures from the time he made his Dallas debut in Week 11 through the end of the season, a figure that ranks as the 12th-most in the NFL in that span and the third-most among defensive tackles in that time. That's why he ended up being the Cowboys defense's sole Pro Bowl player in 2025. \nDespite ex-Cowboys Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs clashing about zone vs. man coverage usage all seasons before Dallas released him after Week 17, Williams vouched for the embattled Eberflus to return as defensive coordinator in 2026 as he took accountability for what went on in between the white lines this season. Eberflus himself took accountability for the defense's performance on Thursday, but he also said he wouldn't go back and do anything differently if he could. \"I love 'Flus man. I haven't really kind of been here [long enough] to know him from a personal standpoint, but the defensive scheme, the things that we did, I think was very, very good. Very smart,\" Williams said Monday at Cowboys locker room cleanout. \"I think us as players had a lot of hand in the pot to kind of execute and do the things that we can do. Because at the end of the day, around the NFL and around the world, Cover 3 is Cover 3. Man [coverage] is man [coverage]. Cover 2 is Cover 2. You got to win your one on ones in all aspects of the game. As players, you got to compete.\" The acquisitions of three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark in the Parsons trade, and Williams midseason boosted the Cowboys' run defense: Dallas was 29th in run defense in 2024 (137.1 rushing yards per game allowed) and 23rd in 2025 (125.5 rushing yards per game allowed). However, the Cowboys ranked as the NFL's worst passing defense, allowing 251.5 passing yards per game because of a lack of sack production without Parsons (35 in 2025, tied for the 11th-fewest in the league) and disarray in coverage in the secondary.   \nCowboys defense under Matt Eberflus in 2025, NFL ranksNFL rankPPG allowed30.1* LastTotal YPG allowed377.030thYards per play allowed6.131stPassing yards per game allowed251.5LastThird down conversion rate allowed 47.3%LastRed zone TD rate allowed 66.7%29thCompletion percentage allowed68.5%30thPass yards per attempt allowed8.131stPasser Rating109.631st* Second-most PPG allowed in a season in the Cowboys' 66-season historyThat's why Williams knows it's on the defense to make great strides this offseason. He forced a career-high three fumbles in 2025, but his sack total of 2.5 tied his career low from his rookie year in 2019. That's an area he knows he needs to improve upon going forward. Williams peaked in that category in 2022 with 12.0 sacks with the Jets. \"I know that we got to get better, especially having the offense that we have,\" Williams said. \"Whatever we got to do to get better, is going to happen. ... I just have to analyze, talk to the coaches and look at things, but I know first and foremost, to point the finger at myself, to try to get better. Especially with being able to be a game-changing tackle and get those big time sack-fumbles and affect the game at a higher level than I did this year. I think that's one step that is going to help us go in the right direction, so I'm super excited. ... I'm super excited for this coaching staff. ... Having 0 [linebacker DeMarvion Overshown] a fully healthy this offseason in his leadership. Having [defensive tackle] Osa [Odighizuwa] in his leadership. [Defensive tackle] Kenny [Clark] a full offseason in his leadership. Me in a full offseason in leadership. So we have the right guys in that unit to get things going in the right direction. No matter who Dallas' defensive coordinator is going forward, he would like to continue playing in an attack front scheme, a scheme that asks the defensive line to play up field and be the aggressors instead of just playing off of the offensive line's blocks. \"It's super important, no matter what scheme I'm in. I want to win,\" Williams said. ... \"What I'm asked to do, I'm willing to do if for the betterment of this team and the betterment of getting better as a defense.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood will return for his sophomore season, he announced, giving first-year Wolverines coach Kyle Whittingham a cornerstone around which to build his debut roster.Retaining Underwood was priority No. 1 for Whittingham upon his arrival at Michigan. The firing of Sherrone Moore and staff turnover that occurred in the wake of the stunning ouster cast uncertainty over the prized former five-star recruit's future. That Whittingham was able to keep Underwood in Ann Arbor is a major early victory for the veteran coach and could help him hit the ground running with a competitive first year in the Big Ten.Teams in search of quarterback help would have knocked down the doors to land Underwood had he entered the transfer portal, but his contract with Michigan may have factored in his decision to stay. Underwood signed a multi-year deal out of high school that, per CBS Sports' Chris Hummer, pays him more than $2 million per season. His deal also comes with a significant buyout that would have made a transfer more challenging.While Underwood's freshman season came with a number of hiccups, including his three-interception day in the Citrus Bowl loss to Texas last week, the Michigan quarterback also dazzled at times and displayed immense upside as a potential star in the making. He led the Wolverines to a 9-3 regular-season record, passed for 2,428 yards and ran for six touchdowns with a display of dual-threat talent.\nWhittingham constructed an identity at Utah that revolved mostly around defense, but the staff he brings with him to Michigan has the potential to turn Underwood into a stellar playmaker. Offensive coordinator Jason Beck is a bright mind who produced statistical anomalies from his past quarterbacks and most recently developed Devon Dampier into a dual-threat standout. His track record suggests he can turn Underwood into a refined passer while utilizing his legs to construct a dynamic, yardage-eating attack.If Underwood takes his expected step forward as a sophomore, the Michigan offense in total should benefit and improve upon its mediocre 2025 production. The Wolverines were just the 69th-highest-scoring team in the country and ranked No. 107 in passing offense during his debut season.\nDespite all of the upheaval inside the Michigan program, retaining Underwood gives Michigan a bright outlook for 2026 and beyond. With three years of eligibility remaining, the former No. 1 overall recruit has ample time to reach his ceiling. If he taps into that potential this season, the Wolverines could contend for a College Football Playoff berth in Year 1 of the Whittingham era. After all, they were effectively one win shy of earning a spot in the bracket in 2025.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL playoffs are here, and I love doing playoff challenge leagues. Why stop setting Fantasy lineups if we don't have to just yet?Now, there are many different forms of playoff challenge leagues, so knowing your rules are important. There are total points leagues throughout the postseason, leagues where you can only use someone once in each round and Guillotine leagues, among others.The best way to approach any playoff challenge league is to map out the NFL postseason. Decide on what teams you think will advance to Super Bowl LX, and build out playoff scenarios from there. And this year the playoffs feel wide open, which makes it tough.For example, here is my playoff picture. In the AFC, I expect the Patriots, Bills and Texans to advance past the wild-card round. I have Buffalo beating Denver and New England winning against Houston, and then I have the Bills advancing to the Super Bowl with a win over the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.I know that seems crazy with how poorly Buffalo has looked at times this season. And the Bills don't have an easy path to the Super Bowl, starting with the opening game against the Jaguars. But I'm backing Josh Allen and James Cook to help Buffalo represent the AFC in San Francisco this season.In the NFC, I have the Eagles, Packers and Rams winning in the wild-card round. Seattle will then beat Green Bay, and the Rams will upset Philadelphia. The Rams then beat the Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game to advance to the Super Bowl.While the Rams have struggled to close the season, I'm still a believer in Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay, especially with Davante Adams (hamstring) back for the postseason. It won't be an easy path for the Rams, especially if they have to play Philadelphia and Seattle on the road, but I still like Los Angeles as the best team in the NFC.My playoff-challenge rankings are reflected in those predictions. Again, I encourage you to build your own path to the Super Bowl -- and check your league settings. But this is how I expect the playoffs to go and which players will be around the longest in the upcoming NFL postseason.These playoff rankings will be updated each week until Super Bowl LX. And make sure you check out our playoff preview each week with in-depth breakdowns and DFS suggestions for each game.Quarterback1. Josh Allen2. Matthew Stafford3. Drake Maye4. Jalen Hurts5.

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers missed last week's 31-28 loss to the Chicago Bears due to a fracture in his left wrist, but he will be back in the saddle for Pittsburgh's Week 13 matchup against the Buffalo Bills. Mike Tomlin told reporters on Friday that Rodgers was a full participant in practice, and carries no game designation into Sunday.\"It's all systems go,\" Tomlin said. Tomlin said Tuesday that they were optimistic Rodgers could return this week. The veteran signal-caller did not participate in practice on Wednesday, but returned as a full participant on Thursday and Friday. \"We'll start this week with great optimism although we certainly will limit him at the early portions of the week, provide opportunities for the other quarterbacks while preserving him,\" Tomlin said. \"But again, we're comfortable with the general trajectory, but I'll keep you updated in his level of participation and the quality of his participation over the course of the week will be the greatest indicator.\"\nTomlin told CBS Sports' Evan Washburn shortly before kickoff last Sunday that Rodgers did everything he could to put himself in position to start after suffering the injury during the Week 11 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, but it was the \"prudent play\" to start Mason Rudolph. \"He fought his tail off all week, but that's the prudent play for us to make as a collective,\" Tomlin said on NFL Today+. \"He won't be playing this week. We'll let Mason start, and obviously, he's absorbed most of the reps this week.\" Rudolph completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception in his first start of the season. The Steelers out-gained the Bears 345 yards to 328, but 186 of Pittsburgh's total yards came on the ground.\nWhen it comes to Rodgers' return to the lineup, the wrist issue is not so much about pain tolerance as it is the ability for the veteran signal-caller to protect himself. The Steelers, now at 6-5, blew a 3.5-game lead in the AFC North to the Baltimore Ravens. However, the Ravens fell back to second place following their Thanksgiving night loss to Joe Burrow and the Bengals. \n            ",

Multiple players were whistled for offsetting unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after the Rebels and Bulldogs had to be separated following a sack and strip of Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss.After video review of the play, the fumble was ruled an incomplete pass and penalties were assessed. Bulldogs defensive tackle Jaray Bledsoe appeared to throw a punch, but was not penalized after the melee, which began when Ole Miss tight end Dae'Quan Wright began jawing with Tyler Lockhart, leading to him pulling on the Mississippi State player's facemask.\nOle Miss wideout Deuce Alexander and offensive lineman Delano Townsend were called for unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, along with Mississippi State linebacker Malick Sylla.Rebels coach Lane Kiffin told ESPN as he went into the halftime locker room that the officials let the game get out of hand with extra-curricular activities. He also made sure to call out the Mississippi State side, including athletic director Zac Selmon. \n\"We just try to play clean football, for a whole sideline to try to fight and leave the [sideline], including their athletic director, I've never seen anything like it,\" Kiffin said. \"I'm just reminding the [officials], we're just trying to play clean football here. We're not trying to start a fight here. Our guys stayed on the sideline like they're supposed to.\"Before kickoff in Starkville, Mississippi State students reportedly broke into the Ole Miss locker room and stole the jersey of Chambliss, per Kiffin. The competitive on-field battle may be overshadowed by Kiffin's murky future with the Rebels. In spite of Ole Miss' success over the past few seasons, Kiffin is mulling a move to fill the head-coaching vacancy at either LSU or Florida. \nThe buzz grew so loud that Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter had to release a statement revealing that Kiffin will make his final decision on Saturday after the Egg Bowl. \n            \n    ",

Mayfield, who reportedly sustained a low-grade strain to his shoulder, was a limited participant Thursday but was back in practice Friday, leading to a more positive outlook for Sunday's game. \"He was very limited on Wednesday, he did a little more yesterday and he moved around perfectly today, so he's fine,\" Bowles said Friday.After Mayfield's initial injury in the first quarter of the Week 12 game, Mayfield re-aggravated his shoulder on a Hail Mary attempt in the second quarter. Mayfield did not play the rest of the game and spent the second half in a sling as Tampa Bay lost its third straight game. On Wednesday, Bowles said Mayfield was \"sore\" and his availability would come down to how he felt at the end of the week.\nThe Buccaneers (6-5) started the season 6-2, but this rough patch in recent weeks squandered their lead in the NFC South. Now tied with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the division, the Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed in the NFC with six games to play. Tampa Bay is gunning for its sixth straight divisional crown, but Mayfield's availability is paramount to reaching the postseason.Mayfield threw a touchdown pass and two interceptions in the first half of Sunday's loss in Los Angeles before exiting the game. He was among the league's leading MVP candidates through the first six games before the schedule stiffened.The Buccaneers host the Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons over the next three weeks. Now in his third season with the Buccaneers, Mayfield made 45 consecutive starts and has not missed a game since 2022, when a high ankle sprain with the Panthers caused him to miss time. \nMayfield has thrown for 2,406 yards and 18 touchdowns this season with a 60.8 QBR, the second-highest rating of his career.\n            \n    ",

The defense will need to prevent too many big plays by Reed, but Arch Manning has played his best games in November, and the Horns offense is starting to click.

Thanksgiving provided a triple serving of high-stakes drama, with the Dallas Cowboys outdueling the reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, the Joe Burrow-led Cincinnati Bengals stunning the Baltimore Ravens and the Green Bay Packers outlasting the rival Detroit Lions. And the playoff picture is still forming as we speak!Not to be forgotten amid the Turkey Day hysterics: Friday's critical Black Friday clash between the Chicago Bears and Philadelphia Eagles, who each took the field at 8-3 vying for top three seeding in the NFC postseason race. Sunday will also bring a treasure trove of holiday treats, with marquee matchups including the Buffalo Bills' road date with the Pittsburgh Steelers, plus the Minnesota Vikings visiting old friend Sam Darnold in a showdown with the red-hot Seattle Seahawks.As we anticipate more fireworks across the NFL, which teams could warrant more attention as Super Bowl bets? Which clubs register as potential \"Black Friday deals\" with underrated championship odds? Here are a few of our top discount picks:Note: Odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Detroit Lions (+2500)Wait, the team that just lost a critical divisional matchup on Thanksgiving? Remember, these are discount bets. And right now the Lions look far removed from the video-game juggernaut of the 2023-2024 seasons, with a banged-up front and a fading defense. But it's just so hard to believe that a team with so much electricity (i.e. Jahmyr Gibbs, Jameson Williams, Aidan Hutchinson) is going to miss the dance entirely. Coach Dan Campbell has rallied the troops at the last moment before (see: 2022 finale). Maybe, instead of entering the postseason as high-octane darlings, he needs the Lions to go all the way by scratching and clawing instead.Remaining schedule: vs. Cowboys, @ Rams, vs. Steelers, @ Vikings, @ BearsProjected final record: 10-7\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Buffalo Bills (+1100)The Bills are far from the dominant force many expected them to be this year, and things might get uglier on Sunday, with Josh Allen set to face off with the Pittsburgh Steelers without top left tackle Dion Dawkins. But we've seen Allen is still capable of elevating the entire operation alongside James Cook, who barely trails Jonathan Taylor for this year's rushing title. And let's just say Buffalo manages a wild card berth behind the upstart New England Patriots; the entire AFC field feels relatively weak, with even top seeds like the Denver Broncos and Indianapolis Colts juggling shakier quarterback situations, leaving the door open for a late-year spoiler. Remember the Bills were also 6-6 before winning five straight back in 2023.\nRemaining schedule: @ Steelers, vs. Bengals, @ Patriots, @ Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsProjected final record: 11-6\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Green Bay Packers (+1000)The Packers are going to be a popular pick after their Thanksgiving shootout with the Lions, which saw both Jordan Love and Micah Parsons ball out to inch closer to first place in the NFC North. Still, oddsmakers currently like fellow NFC heavyweights in the Eagles (+700) and Los Angeles Rams (+380) a bit better. Which means, if you truly buy into Green Bay's trajectory, now is the time to hop aboard the bandwagon. Matt LaFleur's offense has been streaky, but Love is liable to zip it well against any defense, and Parsons' pass rush should have the \"D\" ferocious into January. If they can also swipe the conference's top seed to ensure the road to the Super Bowl runs through Lambeau, that'd be just a bonus.Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, @ Broncos, @ Bears, vs. Ravens, @ VikingsProjected final record: 12-4-1\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

I plan to use Shakir in plenty of my DFS lineups for this scoring period.Shakir is $5,500 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel, and he has the chance for a big game against the Steelers. Pittsburgh is No. 2 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers, and 13 guys have scored at least 15.3 PPR points against the Steelers this season.Shakir has at least seven targets in four of his past five games, and he scored at least 17 PPR points in two of those outings. In Week 12 at Houston, Shakir had eight catches for 110 yards on 10 targets.\nWe'll see if Dalton Kincaid (hamstring) can play this week for the Bills after missing the past two games, and we know Buffalo doesn't trust Keon Coleman, who has been a healthy scratch for the past two weeks. The Bills are so desperate for receiver help that they signed Brandin Cooks, 32, after he was released by New Orleans.Allen has one reliable receiver, and that's Shakir. And he should have the chance for another big game against the Steelers. \nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 13, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season is entering the home stretch. As we march further into Week 13 after Thanksgiving's tripleheader, only five full weeks of regular-season action remain until the start of the playoffs. That means, while the postseason picture is far from finalized, the race for playoff berths -- and top seeding -- is well underway.Some preseason favorites like the Los Angeles Rams and Philadelphia Eagles are well on their way to the dance. Others, like the reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs and defending AFC South champion Houston Texans, are on the outside looking in. Meanwhile a slew of surprise contenders, from the New England Patriots to the Denver Broncos to the Chicago Bears, are currently challenging for the right to an early-playoff bye.Where, exactly, do all the playoff contenders sit? Which teams would be in the postseason if the schedule were halted today? And which clubs still have a shot to sneak into the mix down the stretch? Below is an updated rundown of the entire playoff picture, complete with remaining schedules for primary contenders:Complete playoff pictureThis is the NFL playoff picture as it stands, with the following teams tabbed for postseason spots:\nAFC standingsNew England Patriots (10-2)Denver Broncos (9-2)Indianapolis Colts (8-3)Pittsburgh Steelers (6-5)Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4)Buffalo Bills (7-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New England Patriots (10-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Giants, vs. Bills, @ Ravens, @ Jets, vs. DolphinsDrake Maye is still on an MVP-caliber run as the face of Mike Vrabel's lineup, and the remaining slate sets them up well for the Patriots' first AFC East title since Tom Brady's final season with the club in 2019. Three of the Pats' final five opponents have losing records, and three of those five fall within the division.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Denver Broncos (9-2)Remaining schedule: @ Commanders, @ Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, @ Chiefs, vs. ChargersDenver is buoyed by Bo Nix's late-game composure and a stellar defense led by Vance Joseph. Dates with the rival Chiefs and Chargers in the final two weeks of the season will likely determine whether the Broncos can rob Kansas City of its 10th straight division crown. But this group is all but a lock to play January ball.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Indianapolis Colts (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Texans, @ Jaguars, @ Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, @ TexansCan Daniel Jones rediscover the early-year efficiency that made him a stunning breakout? He'll have to do so against some stingy defenses down the stretch, with almost every one of Indianapolis' remaining opponents boasting a top 10 scoring \"D.\" Accordingly, the Colts might be the safest bet to slip in these standings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Bills, @ Ravens, vs. Dolphins, @ Lions, @ Browns, vs. Ravens\nThe Steelers hold the North due not so much to their own prowess but rather the shakiness of their rival Baltimore Ravens, who clearly aren't enjoying a fully healthy and/or confident Lamar Jackson. Aaron Rodgers has flashed vintage touch at age 41, but he's coming off an injury of his own, and perhaps more concerning, Mike Tomlin's defense has proven incredibly streaky.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (7-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Raiders, vs. Eagles, @ Chiefs, @ Cowboys, vs. Texans, @ BroncosAmong the current wild card contenders, the Chargers might be in the most danger of losing their spot entirely. The Raiders in Week 13 should be very beatable. Otherwise, however, the Bolts will be up against some of the NFL's best defenses while struggling to keep Justin Herbert comfortable behind a depleted offensive line.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Jacksonville Jaguars (7-4)Remaining schedule: @ Titans, vs. Colts, vs. Jets, @ Broncos, @ Colts, vs. TitansThe mercurial Jaguars roared back to life in Week 11 by smashing the Chargers and escaped with an OT win against the Cardinals in Week 12. They've got a very favorable schedule moving forward. Two dates with the rival Titans bodes well for Liam Coen's squad, as does a matchup with the Jets.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (7-4)Remaining schedule: at Steelers, vs. Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. Jets\nJosh Allen is still capable of playing Superman, as evidenced in Buffalo's Week 11 win over Tampa Bay. But Sean McDermott's defense has been more volatile. New England may be out of reach atop the AFC East, but the Bills have a relatively clear path to a wild card berth if they can claim three or four of their final six matchups.In the huntThe Texans (6-5) aren't to be written off in the South despite C.J. Stroud's recent absence, with DeMeco Ryans' defense ranking No. 1 in the NFL. The Chiefs (6-6) finally rediscovered their late-game flair against the Colts in Week 12, but Patrick Mahomes' last-gasp heroics weren't enough to mask greater offensive issues on Thanksgiving. And the Ravens (6-6), though talented, are just so sloppy, with Lamar Jackson in a funk and John Harbaugh's group losing the ball like crazy on Thanksgiving.NFC standingsLos Angeles Rams (9-2)Chicago Bears (9-3)Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-5)Seattle Seahawks (8-3)Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)San Francisco 49ers (8-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (9-2)Remaining schedule: @ Panthers, @ Cardinals, vs. Lions, @ Seahawks, @ Falcons, vs. Cardinals\nMatthew Stafford is slinging it with as much, if not more, confidence than he did in his title-winning Rams debut. That means L.A. is poised to feast on lesser clubs like Carolina, Arizona and Atlanta moving forward. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (9-3)Remaining schedule: @ Packers, vs. Browns, vs. Packers, @ 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears are proving to the naysayers that they are true contenders after knocking off the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles in convincing fashion. Up next is holding off the Packers, who they face in Week 14, in the NFC North race.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Remaining schedule: @ Chargers, vs. Raiders, @ Commanders, @ Bills, vs. Commanders\nThe reigning Super Bowl champions are struggling down the stretch, losing their past two games to the Cowboys and Bears and dropping down to the No. 3 seed in the NFC.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Cardinals, vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, @ Panthers, @ Dolphins, vs. PanthersEvery year, the Bucs scrape their way through the NFC South race, regardless of who's healthy around Baker Mayfield. The remaining schedule suggests a fifth straight division crown is well within reach, although Week 12's blowout loss to the Rams showed the Bucs may not be ready to hang with the heavyweights in the NFC.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (8-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Vikings, @ Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, @ Panthers, @ 49ersEven after falling to the rival Rams in Week 11, Seattle should hang around in the race for the NFC West title due to Mike Macdonald's physical defense. It helps the Seahawks have a couple upcoming matchups with young and/or replacement quarterbacks; Week 13's date with Sam Darnold's old friends in Minnesota should be spicy.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, @ Broncos, @ Bears, vs. Ravens, @ VikingsMatt LaFleur's offense has been more scattershot than usual over the course of the year, but the NFC North is still up for grabs with three divisional matchups still on tap. And the Pack took care of business on Thanksgiving with a showcase by Jordan Love and Micah Parsons, who could make Green Bay a sneakily scary contender.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. San Francisco 49ers (8-4)Remaining schedule: @ Browns, vs. Titans, @ Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksBrock Purdy has been up and down since his return from a long injury. Regardless, all year, the 49ers have hung around, and now their defense should get some confidence-boosting matchups. The first one came against the Panthers; despite Purdy's three first-half interceptions, the 49ers held on to defeat Carolina.In the huntThe Lions (7-5) aren't the juggernaut they were a year ago at this time, with Dan Campbell's signature fourth-down gambles coming up short, but their young playmakers should keep them in the fight until the end. The Cowboys (6-5-1) are still finding their defensive footing, but Dak Prescott is playing lights out at quarterback, wheeling and dealing with George Pickens at his disposal.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas plays host to No. 3 Texas A&M in a fierce rivalry game to end the regular season at Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin on Friday. The Longhorns will be trying to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive after moving to 8-3 after a dynamic victory against Arkansas. Texas A&M has blazed out to a historic 11-0 start for the first time since 1992. The last time the Aggies won 10 games was 2012, the year Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy. In their most recent SEC game, Texas A&M overcame a 30-3 halftime deficit to shock South Carolina 31-30 to stay unbeaten and virtually clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. Texas has not hosted this rivalry game since 2010, a 24-17 victory for Texas A&M. However, the Longhorns took down the Aggies 17-7 in the return of the rivalry last year at Kyle Field. Emotions will be high for the return to Austin. Where to watch Texas vs. Texas A&M liveDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium -- Austin, TexasTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nFollow along for live updates, highlights and analysis as Texas and Texas A&M renew their longstanding rivalry.  Texas vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  Breakout pass rusher: Texas A&M lost multiple defensive linemen to the NFL last season. However, Cashius Howell has stepped up and emerged as one of the best in the sport. The former Bowling Green transfer was a rotation player last season, but has since emerged to lead the SEC with 11.5 sacks. Amazingly, he has recorded a sack in seven of his eight Power Four games. Against a Texas offensive line dealing with major issues, Howell can change the game. Resurgent Arch: Texas quarterback Arch Manning had a slow start to the year as he acclimated to the job of being QB1, but has found his footing in the second half of the year. Manning now has four straight games of completing more than 60% of his passes with 13 touchdowns to only two interceptions. Texas is 3-1 in those games. Against Arkansas, he became the first Texas QB to score touchdowns via pass, rush and receiving in one game. Texas A&M will be a substantially tougher challenge, but Manning is playing his best ball. \nStrength on weakness: Despite coming into the year with a highly-rated defense, Texas' secondary has been a major liability. In SEC play, the Longhorns rank last in the conference in passing defense, surrendering more than 295 yards per game. Over the last four games, they're giving up 325 passing yards per game. Texas A&M boasts the SEC's best receiving corps behind standouts Mario Craver and KC Concepcion. The Longhorns will have their hands full.   Texas vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  From a matchup perspective, Texas A&M clearly has the upper hand. Their passing offense will gave Texas' defense fits. Top pass rusher Cashius Howell is a matchup nightmare against an inconsistent Longhorns offensive line. Even their special teams has created opportunities. But in a rivalry game of this magnitude, it will be a mental game above all. Mike Elko's squad has stepped up in the biggest moments, and they will do the same to clinch their first spot in the SEC Championship Game and finish 12-0. Pick: Texas A&M -2.5\n                    \n

The seventh-round rookie teamed up with D'Andre Swift to help lead the Bears to a dominant 24-15 upset win over the Eagles on Friday. The biggest surprise was how easy the Bears were able to run the ball. Monangai rushed for 130 yards and a TD while Swift added 125 yards and a TD of his own on a day where the Bears totaled 281 on the ground. It was the most yardage the Eagles have given up on the ground since 2015. Going into Week 12, no team had topped 175 yards rushing against the Eagles this season. The win by the Bears capped a wild 48 hours for underdogs. There were three games on Thanksgiving and the underdog came out on top in each game with the Packers, Cowboys and Bengals all pulling off an upset. The Bengals, who closed as an 8-point underdog, pulled off the biggest upset of the weekend, but the Bears (+7) weren't too far behind. \nWith that in mind, let's get to our holiday grades.Chicago 24-15 PhiladelphiaGreen Bay 31-24 over DetroitDallas 31-28 over Kansas CityCincinnati 32-14 over Baltimore\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

And after what we saw this week from Dusty May's Michigan team in Vegas, the Wolverines left no doubt about whether their newfound standing at the top is deserving. In a Players Era event whose criteria of advancing in a nonbracket tournament was solely scoring differential, Michigan accepted the challenge and, stunningly, destroyed everyone in its path. Case in point: After entering the week with an 18.3 point scoring margin against opponents that ranked, on average, 96.8 at KenPom.com, it defeated three teams in three days this week in Las Vegas whose average KenPom rating is 25.7 -- and by an average margin of 36.7 (!!!) points.Of those three wins, two (Monday vs. San Diego State and Wednesday vs. Gonzaga) were by more than 40 points.There are teams in college basketball whose resume is perhaps better than Michigan's right now, I will concede. (I see ya still, Arizona.) But this is the Power Rankings, after all. It's all about who is peaking right now. And as of right now, no one is hotter than Michigan.\n        \n            \n                Who's college basketball's best team? Michigan makes case with emphatic, history-making Players Era title run\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's dive in to the latest Power Rankings where there are plenty of changes across the top 16. \nWeek 1: Purdue | Week 2: ArizonaCollege Basketball Power Rankings1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Michigan has back-to-back wins over ranked opponents coming out of the Thanksgiving break after beating Auburn and Gonzaga by 30 and 40 points, respectively, on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Players Era. Its big week changed projections at KenPom to now have Michigan, not Purdue, as the favorite to win the Big Ten. Last week: 142\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arizona\n                    \n    \n    No team has three wins over top-15 opponents on its resume like Arizona does at this juncture. Two of those wins came against teams ranked No. 3 in the AP Top 25. The Wildcats defeated Denver 103-73 on Monday to improve to 6-0. 3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Purdue\n                    \n    \n    Purdue flexed its muscles in a big way last Friday at the Baha Mar with an 86-56 beatdown of Texas Tech. It is 6-0 now on the season with wins over Alabama, Memphis and Texas Tech. Last week: 54\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan St.\n                    \n    \n    If you're talking best overall resumes in college basketball, Michigan State deserves a mention in the conversation. It has defeated Arkansas, Kentucky and now North Carolina in its 7-0 start, with a 74-58 victory over the Tar Heels on Thanksgiving Day just their latest feat. The Spartans face Iowa and Duke in their next two games. Last week: 45\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    Iowa State had a perfect week in Vegas at the Players Era despite finishing the week playing outside the money games. It went 3-0 with wins over St. John's, Creighton and Syracuse to coast to 7-0. Last week: 116\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Cameron Boozer had 35 points, nine boards and three assists Thursday in an impressive 80-71 win over Arkansas. He's second among all ACC players in points per game and has Duke 8-0 for the first time since 2017-18. Last week: 27\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Louisville\n                    \n    \n    Louisville is 7-0 and yet it feels like we still hardly know about this team because of its lacking nonconference schedule. That'll change soon with the Cardinals facing Arkansas, Indiana, Memphis and Tennessee up next. Last week: 68\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Gonzaga\n                    \n    \n    After smacking everyone around for much of the first few weeks of the season, Gonzaga was on the receiving end of its own medicine, as Michigan on Wednesday beat the Zags 101-61. I did not see that coming. Rarely do we see face-plants like that from teams like this. Gonzaga gets dinged considerably but still top-10 overall. Last week: 39\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Vanderbilt\n                    \n    \n    Mark Byington has Vanderbilt 7-0 for the first time since 2007-08 with Saint Mary's and SMU on deck this week. The Commodores have six double-digit scorers on the season and hilarious depth that even some of college basketball's royalty might envy.10\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UConn\n                    \n    \n    UConn stands pat in the Power Rankings this week after rebounding from its 71-67 loss to Arizona with a 72-49 beatdown of Bryant at home earlier this week. It faces Illinois on Friday and then travels to KU for a true road test Tuesday. Last week: 1011\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            BYU\n                    \n    \n    BYU dropped out of the Power Rankings after falling to UConn in mid-November but it is back comfortably in the mix after consecutive double-digit wins over Wisconsin and Miami in its last two outings. Last week: NR12\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kansas\n                    \n    \n    Reports of Kansas' death were premature, as it turns out. Despite playing without Darryn Peterson this week, the Jayhawks won three games in three days, culminating with an impressive 81-76 win over Tennessee. The backcourt duo of Melvin Council and Tre White have stepped up in a big way in Peterson's absence. Last week: NR13\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Tennessee\n                    \n    \n    Michigan's 40-point win over Gonzaga and Tennessee's five-point loss to Kansas on Wednesday overshadowed what was arguably the best win of the week in Vegas: Tennessee's 76-73 win over No. 3 Houston. The Vols are playing well despite coming off a loss. And per usual, they are doing it playing some of the best defense in college basketball. Last week: NR14\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Houston\n                    \n    \n    There's lots of room for this Houston team to improve this season. So far they are playing their C+ game. That should be scary for the rest of the sport. Cougars are 7-1 on the season. Last week: NR15\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Indiana\n                    \n    \n    First-year coach Darian DeVries pushed his Indiana team's hot start to 6-0 this week after downing the Hoosiers' highest-rated opponent yet, Kansas State, by a cool 17 points. IU's 6-0 for the first time since 2022-23.Last week: NR16\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa\n                    \n    \n    Speaking of first-year coaches, Iowa's Ben McCollum -- the previous successor to the aforementioned DeVries at Drake who is in his first season in Iowa City -- has the Hawkeyes cruising into December. They are 7-0 coming off wins this week over Ole Miss and Grand Canyon. And with the way Bennett Stirtz is playing, something tells me this team'll be a constant feature in this space all season.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\nQuarterback injuries are again a key factor in NFL betting for Week 13, with some star signal-callers ruled out, others returning to action and one important starter on a playoff-caliber team deemed questionable to suit up. Here, we break down the most important NFL injuries that bettors need to know and what NFL betting lines look like per the latest SportsLine consensus odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. Saints at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee, out)NO WR Chris Olave (back, questionable)\nA struggling Saints team that's starting a rookie quarterback will be very shorthanded here against the Dolphins with star running back Alvin Kamara ruled out and top receiver Chris Olave questionable to suit up in Week 13. The Dolphins are favored by 5.5 points, while the total is 41.5.Texans at Colts (1 p.m. ET)HOU QB C.J. Stroud (concussion, will play)IND QB Daniel Jones (fibula, will play)\nBoth teams will have their starting quarterbacks, which is good news for this AFC South tilt. C.J. Stroud has missed the last three weeks with a concussion, while it was reported this week that Daniel Jones is playing through a fracture in his leg. Jones' mobility against an elite Texans defense will be worth keeping a close eye on.Indy is a 3.5-point favorite. The total is 44.5.Falcons at Jets (1 p.m. ET)ATL WR Drake London (knee, out)\nThe Falcons' season is in a rough spot and only got worse with the recent injury to quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Kirk Cousins will start the rest of the way for Atlanta, and at least for this matchup with the Jets, he won't have top receiver Drake London, who again has been ruled out with a knee injury. The Falcons are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 39.5.49ers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nNeither team has any major injuries of note here. Christian McCaffrey missed practice Wednesday and Thursday, but those were veteran rest days after heavy usage on Monday. The 49ers are favored by 4.5 points, and the total is just 36.5.Rams at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)CAR CB Jaycee Horn (concussion, out)\nThe main injury of note here comes on the Carolina defense with star cornerback Jaycee Horn out with a concussion. The Rams have an elite offense with arguably the best receiver duo in the NFL in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, so Horn's absence is a big one for this matchup.The Rams are 10.5-point favorites on the road. The total is 45.Jaguars at Titans (1 p.m. ET)JAX WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle, will play)TENN TE Chig Okonkwo (foot, questionable)\nThe Jags' offense will get a key weapon back here with the return of Brian Thomas Jr., who missed the last three weeks with an ankle injury. Thomas has had a disappointing Year 2 after a monster rookie season, so the Jaguars will hope to get him more involved over the last few weeks of the season. Tennessee tight end Chig Okonkwo is questionable, which could lead to more reps and looks for rookie Gunnar Helm.  Jacksonville is a 6-point favorite on the road. The total is 41.5.Cardinals at Buccaneers (1 p.m. ET)AZ RB Trey Benson (ankle, out)AZ RB Emari Demercado (ankle, out)AZ RB Bam Knight (knee, questionable)AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (illness, questionable)TB QB Baker Mayfield (left shoulder, questionable)TB RB Bucky Irving (foot and shoulder, questionable)\nThis game features the most injury news of the weekend, starting with Tampa QB Baker Mayfield being questionable after a left shoulder injury knocked him out of last week's loss to the Rams. Head coach Todd Bowles said Mayfield is on track to play, but if he can't, Teddy Bridgewater would start. The team also seems optimistic that running back Bucky Irving will finally return after not playing since Week 4. The Cardinals' running back room is beat up bad, with James Conner out for the year, Trey Benson not yet cleared to return and Emari Demercado out this week. Additionally, Bam Knight is questionable. The good news is the team may get receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. back after he's missed two games due to appendicitis. Tampa is a 4.5-point favorite. The total is 44.5.Vikings at Seahawks (4:05 p.m. ET)MINN QB J.J. McCarthy (concussion, out)\nJ.J. McCarthy has had an abysmal start to his playing career, and he'll be out once again, this time with a concussion. The Vikings will turn to Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie from Minnesota. Brosmer will have good weapons to turn to, but the Vikings have listed two starting offensive linemen as questionable against a tough Seattle defense.The Seahawks are favored by 11.5 points, and the total is 41.Bills at Steelers (4:25 p.m. ET)BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring, questionable)BUFF OTs Dion Dawkins and Spencer Brown (both out)PITT QB Aaron Rodgers (left wrist, will play)PITT WR DK Metcalf (ankle, will play)\nThe Steelers get a boost this week with the return of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who missed last week's loss to Chicago with a fractured left wrist. The veteran signal-caller is good to go in this tough bout with the Bills, and he'll have star receiver DK Metcalf, who missed practice earlier this week with an ankle injury. The Bills are hoping to get tight end Dalton Kincaid back as he's missed the last few weeks, but their O-line will be missing two key starters against a tough Steelers front. Buffalo is a 3-point favorite. The total is 45.5.Raiders at Chargers (4:25 p.m. ET)L.A. RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, out) \nThe Chargers will have to wait at least one more week to get dynamic running back Omarion Hampton back in the mix as the rookie is out after returning to practice this week. With Hampton out, Kimani Vidal will again serve as L.A.'s lead back against a struggling Vegas defense.The Chargers are favored by 9,5 points against the Raiders while the total is 40.5.Broncos at Commanders (8:20 p.m. ET)WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out)WASH WR Terry McLaurin (quad, will play)\nJayden Daniels isn't yet ready to return after an ugly left elbow injury a few weeks ago, but Washington will finally have Terry McLaurin back and catching passes after a lengthy quad injury. Marcus Mariota will start under center against a Broncos team that has the No. 3 scoring defense in the NFL. Denver is favored by 5.5 points, and the total is 43.5.Giants at Patriots (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)NYG QB Jaxson Dart (concussion, will play) \nThe Pats will have a depleted offensive line after losing left tackle Will Campbell for a few weeks as he's on IR, and the team will likely be without starting guard Jared Wilson as well. The Giants will have rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart back after missing two weeks with a concussion, which paved the way for Jameis Winston to start. This will be Dart's first start under interim head coach Mike Kafka.New England is favored by 7.5 points. The total is 46.5.\n            ",

With second-year quarterback Caleb Willams progressing, the Bears have surged into the top 10 of the NFL in scoring offense. The Eagles, on the other hand, have struggled to pile up points coming off their Super Bowl season, entering Week 13 ranked 17th in the NFL in scoring offense.That won't keep DFS players away from big names like Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and A.J. Brown in their NFL DFS lineups, but how much should you weigh Philly's offense struggles against an emerging Chicago offense?

Despite that mediocre number, Hurts is still the fourth-highest scoring Fantasy quarterback in the league. That's thanks in large part to his 17-1 TD-INT ratio as well as his eight rushing touchdowns as Philadelphia has mastered the \"Tush Push\" that helps Hurts pile up touchdowns at an extremely high rate. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Chicago rookie wide receiver Luther Burden III. The second-round pick out of Missouri is becoming Fantasy relevant after back-to-back weeks with five targets, notching a new season high in that category. The speedster already has a 65-yard and a 37-yard reception this season. With a higher use rate in this offense, he has a chance to return huge value as one of the more affordable receivers in the NFL DFS player pool. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Black Friday NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Friday.

    "body": "\n        Anthony Davis recently was No. 2 on the Fanspo NBA trade machine's list of trending players, but I do not recommend trying to come up with realistic deals for him. It is a frustrating exercise, and there's a decent chance it will bum you out. In theory, the situation for Davis -- who is returning to the court Friday night after missing a month with a calf injury -- should be simple: He's turning 33 in March, and the Dallas Mavericks aren't set up to succeed on his timeline. Both sides would be better off with a trade that sends him to a win-now team in exchange for a package of younger players and draft picks.Every expert agrees, though, that the Mavericks can't expect anybody to give up all that much for Davis. It doesn't matter that he was the centerpiece of the Luka Dončić trade less than 10 months ago, and it doesn't matter that he made Second Team All-NBA 17 months ago. \"There's not a lot of teams that are lining up\" to acquire Davis, ESPN's Tim Bontemps said on Monday's episode of the Hoop Collective. In the immediate aftermath of the Nico Harrison firing, The Ringer's Zach Lowe said that the difference between what the Mavs gave up for Davis and what they'll eventually get for him \"will set the world record for the biggest delta in trade returns for one single player in the history of professional sports.\"The big issue is not that Davis arrived at training camp well above his normal playing weight. It's not that he strained his calf a week into the regular season, either. It's his contract.Davis is making $54.1 million this season, is owed $58.5 million next season and has a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28, the season in which he will turn 35. Next August, he'll be eligible to sign an extension that would pay him as much as $275 million over four years and as much as $76 million in 2030-31, the season in which he will turn 38.\nThe first hurdle is finding a team that is mechanically capable of putting a trade package together. That front office not only needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention; it needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention even after taking into account the loss of the players it is trading away. Those players' 2025-26 salaries must total at least $43.1 million, and that team's post-trade payroll cannot exceed the first apron.The second hurdle is finding a team that isn't scared of what it will have to pay Davis down the road. It doesn't necessarily have to be willing to offer him a four-year max extension next summer, but it must be confident that it can extend him on a more team-friendly deal or be comfortable with Davis either hitting free agency in 2027 or picking up his 2027-28 option. Negotiating with future Hall of Famers in their mid-30s can be difficult.And these obstacles are just about one side of the equation. Let's say Davis plays at an All-NBA level for the next few weeks and motivates a few teams to try to trade for him. Will these hypothetical suitors be willing to -- or even have the ability to -- trade multiple first-round picks for him? If not, will the Mavericks be interested in the young players that are on the table? It's easy to say that the Mavs \"should\" trade Davis, but I have yet to see a fake trade involving him that seems both plausible and a no-brainer for them. It is not clear what bar must be cleared for them to find an offer acceptable.\nIf all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's essentially the same story that we've seen with a number of stars under the NBA's latest collective bargaining agreement. There was not a robust trade market for Jimmy Butler, and the Miami Heat ended up accepting a package of Andrew Wiggins, Davion Mitchell, Kyle Anderson, a 2025 first-round pick (that landed at No. 20 and turned into Kasparas Jakučionis) in exchange for Butler, Josh Richardson and two second-round picks. The Phoenix Suns traded Kevin Durant for a fraction of what they'd given up to get him. The trade that ended Brandon Ingram's tenure with the New Orleans Pelicans wasn't strictly a salary dump -- they got a protected first-round pick out of it -- but it felt a lot like a salary dump, didn't it?In Jake Fischer's latest newsletter at The Stein Line, he writes that the Charlotte Hornets aren't interested in moving LaMelo Ball in part because they are \"unlikely to get the sort of offers for Ball they'd be hoping for,\" which he describes as \"somewhat reminiscent of the situation Anthony Davis faces in Dallas.\" He also writes that the Sacramento Kings are \"unlikely to bring back a significant haul\" for Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine or DeMar DeRozan. All of these players are former All-Stars, and it's not as if the whole league has decided they're bad. DeRozan is the only one making less than $38 million this season, though, and, in this landscape, acquiring any of them is complicated.Generally speaking, good teams are not looking for complicated. They don't want to blow up what's working, reorient everything in the middle of the season or set themselves up to be in salary-cap hell a couple of years from now. As trade season approaches -- it unofficially begins on Dec. 15, the day that most players who signed new contracts last summer will be eligible to be traded -- big names like Davis are bound to get the most attention, but they're not the ones who will have the most suitors.\nIf you're a buyer, your ideal target is probably a younger player who complements your core players on both ends, can defend multiple positions, doesn't need tons of touches and is on a relatively cheap contract. This is why the only player ahead of Davis on the Fanspo's NBA trade machine's trending list is a fourth-year guard who is making $2.3 million this season: the Kings' Keon Ellis. According to The Stein Line, more than half the league has called about him.\n            ",

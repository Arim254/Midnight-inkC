    "body": "\n        In case anyone needed a reminder, Aaron Rodgers—the 41-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, vet of 21 seasons, four-time NFL MVP and future Hall of Famer—attended his press conference after the Steelers' 23-9 win over the Browns on Sunday while wearing a black baseball cap with the following words emblazoned on the side: NOT MY FIRST RODEO.So when he was asked about whether he believed his team is trending toward being a contender in the AFC, Rodgers' words carried extra weight.\"Well, that's where we want to be, and we're putting ourselves into position to start entering the conversation,\" he said. \"But a lot can happen.\"You can bet Bengals vs. Steelers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and Projection Model agree with Rodgers that it's time to start taking Pittsburgh seriously in the AFC. The Steelers (4-1) already lead the AFC North by 2.5 games over the Cincinnati Bengals (2-4) and can increase their lead with a victory over the Bengals on Thursday night at Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati. The injury-ravaged Ravens and Browns sit at the bottom of the division at 1-5 each.According to the projection model, no team in the AFC has a better chance to win its division than the Steelers (87.8%). Only the Buccaneers of the NFC South have a better chance in the entire league, at 93.5%. Only the Bills (22.4%) have a better chance of winning the AFC than Pittsburgh (16.5%) according to the model. The numbers are more remarkable when you consider the model projects the Steelers to finish with just the third-best record in the conference behind both Colts (5-1) and Bills (4-2). AFC teamProjected winsWin divisionReach playoffsWin AFCWin Super BowlColts11.471.1%93.2%15.3%6.3%Bills11.268.1%91.7%22.4%11.7%Steelers10.787.8%92.5%16.5%7.4%Broncos10.737.5%81.8%12.9%6.7%Chiefs10.334.4%76.4%15.7%8.7%Patriots9.831.6%65.5%3.1%0.9%Chargers9.828.0%70.7%5.9%2.5%Jaguars9.419.6%56.7%2.7%1.0%Texans8.79.3%44.3%3.8%1.8%So for the Thursday Night Football game against Cincinnati, keeping pace with Buffalo and Indianapolis will be what's on the line for Rodgers &. Co. The Bills have an easier remaining strength of scheduled than Pittsburgh down the stretch, while the Colts have the advantage of an extra win and a bye week remaining over the Steelers.Pittsburgh enters Thursday's game on a three-game winning streak, while the Bengals have dropped four in a row since losing starting quarterback Joe Burrow indefinitely due to a turf toe injury. Defense has led the Steelers during their hot stretch. Over the last three games, they have allowed just 14.7 points per game while forcing seven turnovers and registering 17 sacks. Pittsburgh has sacked the quarterback at least five times in three straight games and in Sunday's win over Cleveland, the Steelers hit Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel 16 times, the second most by any NFL team in a game this season.The defense has forced 10 turnovers this year, which is tied for third most in the NFL. That's bad news for a Cincinnati team that has turned the ball over 11 times, which is tied for the most in the league.The Steelers are 5.5-point favorites over the Bengals.\nBut Thursday games on the road haven't been friendly to Pittsburgh. The Steelers have lost eight of their last nine Thursday road games under coach Mike Tomlin, including four in row. Given the roll Pittsburgh is on, that trend seems to be in jeopardy.\"Thursday is all about the league and making money, and we understand that,\" Rodgers said. \"It used to be just Thanksgiving Thursdays, and they added obviously Thursday games. And then Amazon coming in with a nice chunk of change. So we know what it's all about. But it's the same; everybody's got at least one of these, so we just suck it up. We go on the road and take care of business, and we get a little break.\"No one would know better than Rodgers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After losing to the Golden State Warriors in an intense seven-game playoff series back in 2023, it seemed like the Sacramento Kings had finally escaped the mediocrity that surrounded the franchise for the better part of the last decade. The Kings broke the longest playoff drought in North American sports, finished with the No. 1 offensive rating in NBA history (at the time), and finally, for once, had a clear direction with Mike Brown as coach and De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis as co-stars.Since that moment, most of the transactions the franchise has made -- highlighted most recently by the signing of former league MVP Russell Westbrook on Wednesday -- are more signs that Sacramento is heading in the wrong direction with a roster that lacks balance and makes no sense.A metaphor to describe Sacramento's current roster -- that has an influx of guards and very little playable forwards -- is to think of your local all-you-can-eat buffet, which probably serves a variety of cuisines. Sure, on the surface, having all the food options you could imagine sounds amazing, but would cheese pizza really pair well with seafood? Probably not. And that's exactly what Sacramento's current roster is -- a bunch of dishes that could make sense individually (in this case, on different teams), but paired together would make your stomach turn. The on-court product has a similar senetiment.\n\n        \n            \n                Kings sign Russell Westbrook: Former league MVP heads to seventh different team for 2025-26 season\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWestbrook is approaching the twilight of his career. There is no denying he has had his moments -- for better or worse -- while playing for five different teams since 2019. Westbrook is still a good leader and someone who can provide a spark off the bench, but does he really make sense for a team that has a logjam of guards already?Sacramento entered this offseason without a true point guard on the roster, which, to Westbrook's credit, he still is. The Kings signed Dennis Schröder to a three-year deal after a sign-and-trade with the Detroit Pistons, which ended up dragging along during the start of free agency because Sacramento had strong reported interest in restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga.But with Westbrook, Schröder, Malik Monk, DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine -- the headliner in the trade that sent Fox to the San Antonio Spurs at last season's trade deadline -- the Kings have a team built to compete for a play-in berth instead of looking in the mirror, having the uncomfortable conversation about how everyone fits together on the roster and developing the young talent the franchise has.\nSacramento is +185 (on FanDuel) to make the Play-In Tournament. The Kings have the sixth-best odds to make the play-in behind the Spurs, Mavericks, Grizzlies, Lakers and Warriors.So, what direction should Sacramento take?Going back to the winter of 2022 -- before that season's trade deadline -- the Kings had a logjam of point guards on the team, with Tyrese Haliburton, Davion Mitchell and Fox on the roster. The fit of Haliburton and Fox never quite worked out. It was part of the reason why the front office could stomach trading Halliburton to the Indiana Pacers for Domantas Sabonis because Sacramento believed he could elevate their offense while serving as the playmaking hub, which he did during the 2022-23 season.The problem, however, dating back to the playoff loss in 2023, is that the Kings failed to make the big swing under former general manager Monte McNair. The Kings were linked to various trade targets in recent years, including OG Anunoby, Pascal Siakam, Lauri Markkanen, Alex Caruso and more. All of those names would've filled a clear need at the wing next to Keegan Murray, who is now set to miss at least the next four to six weeks after undergoing surgery on his thumb.\nIt's part of the reason why the Houston Rockets' big swing on trading for Kevin Durant was so admirable. After catching lightning in a bottle and having a remarkable turnaround en route to the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference, Houston parlayed that by making a substantial upgrade to its roster that puts the franchise in a position to make a run at the title this season.Without Murray, the Kings don't have a serviceable starting-level replacement on the roster. Sure, you can play DeRozan or even rookie Nique Clifford -- who was a star during summer league -- at the four, but both players would be undersized and overmatched for their respective matchups on a given night. That's part of the reason why Sacramento this offseason was reportedly so infatuated with the idea of pairing Murray with Kuminga in the frontcourt. Sacramento would have two forwards to build around who would complement each other's skill sets. Kuminga, who is eligible to be traded by the Golden State Warriors on Jan. 15, 2026, would've been the youngest player on Sacramento's roster.\nThe direction Sacramento should take is a simple one that owner Vivek Ranadivé has shown he is not willing to do since buying the team in 2013: rebuild. The 2026 NBA Draft is loaded at the top, and the Kings (outside of a 2031 pick swap with the Spurs) have all their future firsts. There are three players in particular worth keeping an eye on: BYU's AJ Dybantsa, Kansas' Darryn Peterson and Duke's Cameron Boozer. Even outside of that, Tennessee's Nate Ament and Louisville's Mikel Brown Jr. look worth losing for.All of those players would give Sacramento a true building block and clear direction heading into the 2026-27 season and beyond. However, the signing of Westbrook signals the Kings aren't ready to take that necessary step to one day return to the playoffs. \nInstead of playing former first-round pick Devin Carter, soon-to-be free agent Keon Ellis, Clifford, Murray and other young pieces on the roster substantial minutes, they will likely be relegated to smaller roles with the veterans taking the front seat toward a berth in the play-in.Signing Westbrook for the minimum isn't the problem at the end of the day. In fact, most of the moves Sacramento made to put itself in this position in the first place were by (current Kings general manager) Scott Perry's predecessor. Perry, who has experience rebuilding rosters, once again finds himself behind the eight ball with an expensive roster that lacks a clear identity.With one week until the Kings begin their season against the Phoenix Suns, Sacramento has a roster that makes no sense -- with no clear resolution in sight. If Ranadivé's goal is to fill the arena by adding big-ticket players, then signing Westbrook accomplishes the mission and fulfills the shortsided vision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. women's national team will finally take the pitch after a long summer. The program had no matches with global tournaments across Europe, Africa, and South America this year, and head coach Emma Hayes has named a 26-player roster for the upcoming October friendlies.The Stars and Stripes will play three games during the international window, beginning with two games against Portugal before closing out against New Zealand. Hayes spoke with the media about her roster selections and vision for the senior team as the group looks ahead to FIFA World Cup qualifiers on the horizon.Qualifiers closer than you thinkThe Concacaf W Championship, set for Nov. 2026, is the official World Cup qualifying competition for the region. The USWNT, alongside Canada, is the top-ranked nation in Concacaf, and they will await the six winners from the Concacaf W Qualifiers, which begin next month.\"This is really the build towards qualification for next year. That's what the start of this cycle actually means. And that's not to say that this is the pool of players, solely. You know, It was difficult to make roster selections for this camp,\" Hayes told the media on Wednesday.\n'We felt that by taking 26 players, one, I want to honor the place where NWSL is with playoffs and want to maximize. We take 26 so that I can play players, and also send them back to their clubs in a really good condition. But I think this was the one camp I had to make some really, really hard decisions, and that's the place that I wanted to be in, but it's the build for qualification for next year.\"U-23 program an extension of the senior teamThe USWNT manager was clear that three months away from competition isn't ideal, but time away is necessary sometimes and there's fresh energy about a reunion between staff and players. There's also continuing the work around \"futures camps,\" with the U-23 team that was relaunched earlier this year. \"Three months feels like a long time, that's, you know, we're really excited to get back in with the players. Second of all, we've always looked at the futures, initially in the under-23 as an extension of a larger playing pool,\" said Hayes.\n\"I won't bore you with it now, but we know that we have to provide so many more development opportunities for younger players, and that's why there'll be a flip-flopping between [USWNT] and under 23s.\"The U-23 roster will be announced on Thursday, and the training camp will run concurrently with the senior team while they're in camps preparing for friendlies in Philadelphia and Connecticut. Hayes and the staff are also integrating the U-20s team, with a camp that will join the senior team in Kansas City for the final match against New Zealand. Jaedyn Shaw example of youth and senior collaboration Midfielder Jaedyn Shaw is back in the mix with the senior team after for the first time since February. The 20-year-old was recently traded to Gotham FC and has been more productive in the attack since the move. She's split time with senior camps and U-23 teams throughout 2025. \n\"I think Jayden Shaw, even Jordan Bugg, maybe Lily Reale, are good examples of like the integration between under-23s and seniors,\" said Hayes.\"Do I think that Jaden Shaw will stay solely playing for the seniors from here all the way? No, I don't. I think there is a possibility, especially next camp, we may make the decision as a collective to give her games against top European teams. But what I feel is that Jaedyn has taken on board everything that we've been asking of her ... I think she's really starting to put all of those things together. She's an incredible goal threat in so many ways. And I think this is an opportunity for us to see from the last time, to now, how much of that gap she has closed.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        New veteran acquisitions, either by trade or signed as free agents, paying dividends were highlighted last week. The opposite end of the spectrum gets the focus this time around. Several veteran newcomers who haven't lived up to expectations so far have been identified. Contribution, availability, salary and draft capital to acquire were taken into account when making the selections. Joe Flacco and Russell Wilson aren't included because each was expected to be replaced by a rookie quarterback at some point this season. It happened sooner than anticipated. Wilson was benched for New York Giants first-round pick Jaxson Dart, who was taken 25th overall, after three games. Flacco lasted four games before Cleveland Browns third-round pick Dillon Gabriel took over. Obviously, neither was playing well. Both ranked near the bottom in completion percentage and passer rating. Flacco's six interceptions when he was benched were the NFL's second most through four games.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Justin Fields, QB, New York JetsFields' preseason struggles were dismissed instead of being seen as a warning sign after he played well against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular-season opener. It's been downhill for Fields ever since the Steelers game. Fields had a dubious distinction in Week 6's loss to the Denver Broncos, which dropped the NFL's only winless team to 0-6. Fields was sacked nine times in producing a franchise-worst minus-10 net passing yards. The 2021 first-round pick has a tendency to hold the ball too long and doesn't see the field as well as he should in his fifth NFL season.Coach Aaron Glenn was taken aback at questions about whether Fields should be benched in favor of Tyrod Taylor. Fields may have a fairly long leash because of economics. The Jets signed him to a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed as an unrestricted free agent in March.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Geno Smith, QB, Las Vegas RaidersThe Raiders dealt a 2025 third-round pick to the Seattle Seahawks for Smith in March to provide quarterback stability after having six players start at quarterback since releasing Derek Carr, following the 2022 season. Shortly after the trade, Smith was given a two-year, $75 million contract extension, averaging $37.5 million per year with $50.5 million in guarantees where $42.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Incentives and salary escalators make the deal worth as much as $84 million.\nThe trade reunited Smith with Pete Carroll, who was hired as Raiders coach in January. Carroll was Smith's coach during the first five years of his six years in Seattle. Smith hasn't resembled the player who was named 2022's NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He leads the NFL with 10 interceptions while the Raiders are off to a 2-4 start. Smith is the first to throw 10 interceptions in the first six games since Kirk Cousins in 2020. His 77.6 passer rating is 31st in the NFL.Smith could have a short stint in Las Vegas if he can't get the interceptions under control like Cousins did. Cousins only had three more passes picked off for the rest of the 2020 season. \nOut of Smith's $26.5 million base salary in 2026, $18.5 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The Raiders would pick up $8 million of 2026 salary cap space by releasing Smith before the remainder of his base salary becomes fully guaranteed next March 13 on the third day of the 2026 league year.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dan Moore Jr., OT, Tennessee TitansMoore received a four-year, $82 million contract with $50 million in guarantees, of which $42.51 million was fully guaranteed at signing to be a key upgrade for the Titans on the offensive line. The signing allowed JC Latham, 2024's seventh overall pick, to move to right tackle, his position in college at Alabama. Things haven't gone as planned. The four sacks Moore has surrendered are tied for the NFL's fourth most among left tackles, according to Pro Football Focus. The 18 quarterback pressures (combined sacks, quarterback hurries and quarterback hits) Moore has allowed are also the sixth most for a left tackle as tracked by PFF. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Evan Engram, TE, Denver BroncosEngram quickly found a home in Denver after being a salary cap casualty of the Jacksonville Jaguars in early March. He signed a two-year, $23 million contract worth up to $26 million through incentives with $16.5 million fully guaranteed. \nCoach Sean Payton envisioned Engram operating in the \"Joker\" role as an offensive weapon who moves around to create mismatches like he utilized to great success with his offenses during his 15 years coaching the New Orleans Saints. Engram, who has been slowed with calf and back issues, has 17 receptions for 137 yards and one touchdown in five games this season. The Broncos will need to get Engram more involved in the offense to reach his potential.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Paulson Adebo, CB, New York GiantsThe Giants signed Adebo to a three-year, $54 million deal (worth up to $57 million through incentives) with $38.5 million in guarantees where $34.75 million was fully guaranteed at signing to be their No. 1 cornerback. Adebo has allowed the second most receptions (29) and the fifth most receiving yards (308) among cornerbacks this season, according to PFF.Adebo struggled in coverage against both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens in Week 2's game with the Dallas Cowboys. A.J. Brown got the better of Adebo in Week 6's contest against the Philadelphia Eagles. \nUnder PFF's lockdown percentage metric, which measures how well a defender prevents a receiver from getting open, Adebo is at 31.07%. By contrast, Charvarius Ward, who signed a similar $18 million per year deal with the Indianapolis Colts, has a 55.56 lockdown percentage this season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Haason Reddick, EDGE, Tampa Bay BuccaneersReddick was one of the NFL's most effective pass rushers before an ill-convinced 90-day holdout that ended during the latter part of October last season. He had one sack in the 10 games he played with the Jets after ending his holdout. NFL teams didn't give Reddick the benefit of the doubt for his 2024 performance as a big payday in free agency eluded him. Reddick signed a one-year, $14 million contract where $12 million was fully guaranteed with the Buccaneers. \nReddick has yet to resemble the two-time Pro Bowler who was coming off four straight seasons with double-digit sacks prior to his holdout. The 31-year-old has 1.5 sacks in six games this year, which puts him on pace for four sacks.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dre Greenlaw, LB, Denver BroncosThe Broncos ignored durability concerns about Greenlaw when signing him to a three-year, $31.5 million contract, averaging $10.5 million per year worth up to $34.5 million. Greenlaw looked great when making his short-lived 2024 season debut in Week 15 after recovering from a torn Achilles suffered in Super Bowl LVIII. Left knee soreness sidelined Greenlaw during the third quarter of his return game. A calf injury the following week landed Greenlaw on injured reserve. Greenlaw was on the field for just 34 defensive snaps last season. He was also limited to three games in 2021 because of a groin injury.Greenlaw is on IR with a quad injury. He initially hurt his quad while training and couldn't participate in the offseason workout program because of the injury. A setback during training camp kept Greenlaw out of action in preseason games and the first two regular-season games before landing him IR. Greenlaw is now eligible to be activated from IR after missing the requisite four games after going on the list. He is expected to give an already stingy Broncos defense a boost once he returns. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cam Robinson, OT, Houston TexansRobinson was signed to a one-year, $12 million contract worth a maximum of $14.5 million through incentives as a part of wholesale changes the Texans made in revamping the offensive line. The assumption was Robinson would replace Laremy Tunsil, who was traded to the Washington Commanders in March, at left tackle. Robinson's minor left knee injury during training camp opened the door for 2025 second-round pick Aireontae Ersery to take the starting role. Robinson had started all of the 101 games he had played in his eight NFL seasons prior to this year.The Cleveland Browns losing starting left tackle Dawand Jones to a season-ending knee injury in Week 3 led to a trade for Robinson. The Texans acquired a 2027 sixth-round pick in exchange for Robinson and a 2027 seventh-round pick. Robinson was a healthy scratch in his final game with the Texans against the Titans in Week 4 before the trade. The Texans paid $9,415,032 for his four-game stint, which mostly consisted of an $8.75 million signing bonus.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Najee Harris, RB, Los Angeles ChargersHarris signed a one-year prove-it deal for a fully guaranteed $5.25 million, with an additional $4 million in incentives, despite rushing for over 1,000 yards in each of his four NFL seasons. An eye injury sustained in a Fourth of July fireworks mishap cost Harris practically all of the preseason. He wasn't cleared for full contact until a couple of days before the Chargers' regular-season opener. The Chargers were starting to gradually increase Harris' workload when he tore his left Achilles in Week 3 against the Broncos. Harris, who was expected to split time in the backfield with 2025 first-round pick Omarion Hampton, had 61 yards on 15 carries in the three games he played prior to his injury. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chauncey Gardner-Johnson, S, Houston TexansThe Super Bowl champion Eagles sent Gardner-Johnson and a 2026 sixth-round pick to the Texans for offensive guard Kenyon Green and a 2025 fifth-round pick in March. Only $2 million of Gardner-Johnson's $7.75 million base salary was fully guaranteed until $6.58 million of this $7.75 million was converted to signing bonus a few days before Houston's regular-season opener. The remaining $1.17 million left as base salary was fully guaranteed.Gardner-Johnson, who tied for the NFL's third most interceptions with six in 2024, started Houston's first three games, before he was released. Key missed assignments in those games, all one-score losses, and reported locker room friction led to Gardner-Johnson's departure. Gardner-Johnson joined the Baltimore Ravens' practice squad ahead of Week 6's games. He was granted his release after the Ravens subsequently acquired safety Alohi Gilman from the Chargers in a trade. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There is little doubt throughout the coaching industry from administrators, agents, and college football coaches themselves that the 2025 coaching cycle is setting up to be unprecedented. There are already nine open jobs, including seven that have opened midseason, and more are expected to pop soon.  You rarely get more than a couple changes before Halloween in a normal year. This is the first year since the FBS era began in 1978 that seven or more jobs have opened before November, according to CBS Sports researchers. Last year saw 30 jobs change, but only five Power Four jobs among them. This cycle will be similar to 2021, when LSU and USC fired coaches early in the cycle -- leading to serious downstream effects. We've already seen one of college football's bluest of blue bloods open in Penn State, which has only had four total coaches since 1950. Industry sources are bracing for as many 40 jobs to open, especially given the likelihood of head coaches getting poached for jobs like Penn State or UCLA.\n        \n            \n                College football coaching carousel tracker: Grades, analysis on coach changes, 2025-26 firings and hirings\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn addition to the coaches fighting for their jobs and the many disruptions to the industry that will come via coaches moving jobs, there's another category that could shake the carousel -- retirements. \nAll of it comes together for a cycle that in the words of one source is \"about to get f***** wild.\" CBS Sports surveyed sources around the country to paint a picture of just where the coaching carousel sits halfway through the season with so much already spinning.    Hot seat scale on jobs that could come open Note: Schools listed by degree of heat (the more flames, the hotter the seat) which can of course swing swing by the week.  \nFlorida 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Billy Napier's been perpetually on the hot seat for almost 18 months at this point. A 1-3 start did him no favors. The Gators have a winnable game at home this weekend against Mississippi State ahead of their bye week, but a bye week is an opportune time to make a change, win or lose. Of note, Napier would be owed around $20 million if fired with half of that due within 30 days, per his contract. Wisconsin 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥In the words of one industry source: \"The job I'm hearing is the hottest is Wisconsin.\" Luke Fickell is in his third year and is 15-17 at Wisconsin, a program that didn't post a losing season between 2002 and 2023. Fickell's buyout is sizable at around $25 million, and is a concern sources have brought up. However, unlike with Napier, Fickell would be paid out monthly through 2032. Wisconsin has games with Ohio State and Oregon over the next two weeks ahead of its bye week. Coastal Carolina 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Tim Beck picked up a needed win last week over ULM, but industry sources continue to point to Coastal as a job that could open. Coastal's athletic director, Chance Miller, did not hire Beck, and Beck's record over the last two years is just 9-10. \nColorado State 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 As several have written about before, Jay Norvell has not received a contract extension with just one year left on his deal after this season. That's a sign change could come as it's rare for coaches to work under that type of uncertainty. Industry sources continue to circle this job as one that's trending toward coming open after the Rams' 2-4 start. Auburn 🔥🔥🔥🔥 With Auburn in the midst of a three-game losing streak, industry sources have pointed to Hugh Freeze's seat as getting warmer by the week. \"If they lose the next two, I think he's out,\" one source said. \"The pressure is real. I don't think they want to do it. I think he's coaching for his job. Back against the wall.\"  \nAthletic director John Cohen delivered a tacit vote of confidence when he said that a coaching change is \"not my expectation at this point.\"  When asked whether or not he expects Freeze to be Auburn's head coach in 2026, Cohen said he has a \"never say never\" attitude, and used a metaphor about a car not starting to explain his thought process. \t \t\"I don't know if I'm going to walk outside and my car is going to start or not, I think it is,\" Cohen said. \"I have an expectation it will. But if my car doesn't start enough, then I will evaluate that and make decisions about my car. But that's not my expectation at this point about our football program.\" \t \tFlorida State 🔥🔥🔥The heat is starting to turn back up on Mike Norvell after the goodwill he created with a 3-0 start. Recent losses to Virginia and Pittsburgh have kicked up the hornet's nest again. But the reality is Norvell would be owed around $58 million if he were to be fired. As one industry source put it: \"That's a lot of money, man.\" Especially so at a place like FSU that's been trying to find ways to generate more revenue. Still, it's a job worth monitoring as the season continues.   Kentucky 🔥🔥🔥 Things have gone sideways in Lexington the last two seasons. Mark Stoops suffered his first non-COVID losing season since 2016 last year, and the Wildcats are off to a 2-3 start in 2025 with a brutal schedule ahead. Still, Stoops does have a fair amount of protection via his contract. The winningest head coach in program history, Stoops' buyout is close to $38 million and it would be owed in a lump sum within 60 days. That's a lot of money for an athletics department that just took $141 million in loans from the university to offset stadium renovation costs and as a cash infusion to offset a budgetary deficit.  Akron 🔥🔥🔥One of the toughest jobs in the entire FBS, Joe Moorehead is just 10-33 in four seasons with the Zips. Many in the industry speculate that Moorhead could eventually leave Akron and take an offensive coordinator job elsewhere. Of note, Moorhead's youngest child, Donovan, is a high school senior and is committed to play quarterback at Jacksonville State.The North Carolina conversationIf we had to place North Carolina in a flame meter discussion, truthfully it would be 2.5 out of five. Last week's theatrics are emblematic of the lack of alignment that underscored Bill Belichick's hire in the first place. Things are not going well in Chapel Hill, where the Tar Heels have one of the worst rosters in the Power Four. \n\n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick shuts down buyout talk, focused on winning at North Carolina: 'It's a learning curve'\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelichick addressed the rumors in a press conference on Monday. \"Reports about my looking for a buyout or trying to leave here is categorically false,\" Belichick said. \"There's zero truth to any of that. I'm glad I'm here.\"A safe landing?While many jobs are heating up at the midway point of the season, the seats of several coaches have cooled considerably thanks to strong starts. ArizonaBrent Brennan's seat was warm coming into his second season following a 4-8 debut that saw the Wildcats lose all the momentum they had generated under Jedd Fisch. But the Wildcats have gotten off to a strong start this season at 4-2 with plenty of opportunities to pick up wins down the stretch. Conversations around that job have cooled considerably.\nCaliforniaIn the ACC there was some scuttle that Cal head coach Justin Wilcox could be in trouble after five straight losing seasons and an offseason of roster losses. But the Bears look resurgent at 4-2 and have a building block for the future in true freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele. CincinnatiThere was a lot of pressure on Scott Satterfield entering this year after back-to-back losing seasons with the Bearcats. But thanks to strong portal classes and internal development, the Bearcats have raced out to 5-1 and look like a burgeoning Big 12 contender.Louisiana TechCoach Sonny Cumbie may have had the hottest seat in the country entering the year, but that's cooled thanks to the Bulldogs' 4-2 record. Louisiana Tech did suffer a bad 35-7 loss to Kennesaw State over the weekend, though, so it's not like Cumbie is totally safe. \nLatest on open jobs \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Arkansas   Athletic director Hunter Yurachek said last month that the program was not set up to win a championship in football and a clear vision for future resources is a must. One personnel executive questioned Arkansas' front office setup with an overarching general manager with a basketball background, Remy Cofield, overseeing negotiations for multiple sports. Arkansas has multiple mouths to feed resource wise as John Calipari will expect ammunition to build on a Sweet 16 debut season, and baseball is also a significant concern to the school's fanbase.   The obvious name is Rhett Lashlee, a Springdale, Arkansas native and Razorback alum. He will certainly have support, including from Dallas Cowboys owner and Jerry Jones. For Lashlee to consider it, however, Arkansas will have to prove that it has resources that would entice Lashlee away from an SMU job with nearly unlimited resources. Industry sources have indicated other jobs that could come open this cycle are far more likely to tempt Lashlee than Arkansas. Lashlee is also said to be quite happy at SMU, a school that's given him almost everything necessary to compete in the ACC.   Sources told CBS Sports the current Arkansas football roster is worth around $14 million in revenue share and NIL combined, which is considered on the very low end of the SEC resource wise.   \nParker Search firm is assisting Arkansas' search and sources expect a sitting head coach to be the first place Hogs look with North Texas head coach Eric Morris and USF's Alex Golesh also potentially in play among others.   \"I think they're all over the place. I think they've got a top two to three but they're all over the place outside the top three,\" an industry source said.  There is also, obviously, the matter of interim head coach Bobby Petrino, who will certainly have his supporters. The length of this interim tenure (seven games) offers a true trial run for Petrino to prove if he still has what it takes to be a big-time college football coach and win over a fanbase divided over him as the head hog. If Petrino ends up with the job permanently one of two things likely happened: Best case is Arkansas shocks some combination of their remaining opponents (Texas A&M, Auburn, Mississippi State, LSU, Texas, and Missouri) or worst case, nobody Arkansas deems worth hiring actually wanted the job.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kent StateOut of 136 FBS head coach jobs, Kent State is annually in the running to be the very worst. Interim head coach Mark Carney has been at the helm since the offseason firing of Kenni Burns, and multiple industry sources had little clarity about where Kent State was at in the process even with its sizable head start on the rest of its peers in the bottom rung of the sport. Even though Kent State announced its intent to do a full search when he was named Carney the interim, it's unclear where they would turn to as many in the industry view it as a dead end. There's a chance the interim tag gets removed if the Golden Flashes can find a way to squeak out a couple wins in the MAC. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Oregon State  Beavers athletic director Scott Barnes has been an AD at multiple stops and promoted Trent Bray, a former OSU linebacker, to permanent head coach in 2024 after an interim spell. He was frank about Bray's limitations after firing him after OSU began the season 0-7. \"The difference between those hires and this one was Trent didn't embrace the enterprise as a whole,\" Barnes told John Canzano. \"The CEO seat and the enterprise and the tough decisions. All coordinators are a work and progress but you see an appetite for wanting to take on the tough decisions, wanting to command the enterprise, and I didn't see that.\"   There is an open question from industry sources about whether Barnes will be in his post longterm. Oregon State has funding issues as an athletic department as one of the two teams left behind in the Pac-12's implosion, not to mention dwindling contributions from its state government (a growing concern for universities nationwide). There is also an open question as to the fairness of its deal with NIL marketing agency Blueprint sports.   Whoever takes the job, as usual for the Beavers, will have to do more with less and middle-of-the-road resources in the new-look Pac-12. One name floated by sources is Montana State head coach Brent Vigen. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Oklahoma State  The Cowboys are conducting a head coaching search in football for the first time since 2004 when Les Miles left the program for LSU and the program promoted a 38-year-old Mike Gundy to the head job.   There are questions as to whether athletics director Chad Weiberg would make the next hire given he's been working without a contract since June. But sources indicate he's expected to soon sign an extension and is fronting the search. Weiberg is getting assistance from the search firm TurnkeyZRG.   Whoever is the next head coach will have to invest more in the current era of NIL and rev share. Gundy said earlier this year the Cowboys had only spent \"around $7 million\" over the last three years on its roster. A common complaint among the Cowboys' brass was Gundy's unwillingness to embrace both NIL and the transfer portal.   As for candidates to know, there's overlap with the Arkansas job, another program with a similar geographic profile. Industry sources have indicated names like Texas State head coach GJ Kinne, UTSA head coach Jeff Traylor and potentially even Oklahoma offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle should be on the radar along with rising Group of Six coaches like Ryan Silverfield and Alex Golesh.   But other names have been linked heavily with this job in talking with sources. One is Morris, who will be a candidate for multiple jobs this cycle. The other two are both Oklahoma State alumni.   Multiple sources have linked Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson with the Cowboys. Robinson is a former Oklahoma State quarterback and has been an on-the-rise name in NFL circles for years. Said one source of the search: \"That's who I think is getting the job.\" Robinson hasn't coached in college, however, and it's not quite clear he'd be willing to leave the NFL for college football.   The other alumnus to know is Purdue offensive coordinator Josh Henson. A lineman for the Cowboys in the 90s who's made multiple stops with the program as an assistant, Henson is a popular name among Oklahoma State's booster class and is gaining some traction.   A quote to note from Weiberg's press conference in the wake of Gundy's firing: \"We're not going to be afraid to talk to people who are assistant coaches.\"  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Penn StateThe Nittany Lions sent a shockwave through the college football world when AD Pat Kraft fired James Franklin on Sunday in a decision that came together rapidly after Saturday's loss to Northwestern (the second loss in a row as a 20+ point favorite). When asked before the Northwestern game about Franklin's job security, one industry source said \"if they don't make the playoff, let's have this conversation again.\" The reason many were surprised was due to the massive price tag of Franklin's approximately $48 million buyout. Kraft declined to go into any specifics of the financials of Franklin's buyout, and Penn State is not compelled to release Franklin's full contract under Pennsylvania public records laws. According to Front Office Sports, Franklin has a duty to mitigate clause in his contract. The clause, which is standard in college head coaching contracts, states that Franklin must actively seek new employment. If he gets it, the buyout owed to him is offset by his new salary. \n        \n            \n                The Buyout Bubble: Why college football keeps paying millions to make coaches disappear\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpeaking to sources across the industry, the name that comes up in any conversation about Penn State is Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule. The 50-year-old is a Penn State alumnus and is close to Kraft, who hired him at Temple in 2012. Rhule didn't exactly tamp down any Penn State speculation with his initial comments on the job earlier this week: \"(Nebraska) is elite. And I want to be a great father, and I want to be a great college football coach. And so I'm not going to talk a lot about job openings when they come.\"Outside of the obvious connections between Rhule and the Nittany Lions, many conversations with industry sources didn't stray too much from a list any common message board fan could put together due to the timing of Franklin's firing. Though, names like Curt Cignetti, Matt Campbell, Clark Lea, Manny Diaz, Eli Drinkwitz, Alex Golesh and even Urban Meyer have come up in conversations. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Stanford   General manager Andrew Luck is at the helm for a search that will serve as his official stamp on the future of Stanford football. Industry sources differ on the expected impact his father, Oliver, will have on the search. Some say the former West Virginia AD is a de facto co-leader of the search, while another termed his as more of a confidant -- which makes sense if your father had run double-digit executive hiring processes.   Stanford recently announced a $50 million influx into the football program by a donor which made headlines, but when asked if the funds are immediately accessible in full, a Stanford spokesperson told CBS Sports that some of it is and \"some of it is pledged over time.\" The spokesperson was unable to provide a breakdown of how much of the money can be used now and in the future.It is not expected that Stanford will relax admissions standards for football players in the future and it is almost certain that Luck's search will end up being wide ranging, including NFL assistant coaches like the Commanders' Tavita Pritchard or Troy Walters and former NFL assistants like current Maryland OC Pep Hamilton. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UABAnother unclear AD situation lies in Birmingham where Mark Ingram remains in the job after firing Trent Dilfer. \"Ingram took a risk with Dilfer, it might cost him his job,\" an industry source said.  UAB president Ray Watts is not considered deeply involved in athletics, and any move on Ingram would likely come from the school's board of trustees. One name floated for the job is SMU offensive coordinator Casey Woods, who was once an assistant. Another is ULM head coach Bryant Vincent, who is also interim AD for the Warhawks and was formerly interim head coach of the Blazers. There is potential, if Ingram is no longer in the job, to reunite with former head coach Bill Clark as well. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      UCLA     The tenor around UCLA has changed considerably in recent weeks following back-to-back wins over Penn State and Michigan State. Interim head coach Tim Skipper is 2-1 and offensive coordinator Jerry Neuheisel, the son of former Bruins head coach Rick Neuheisel, might be the most popular person on that campus.   Whether Skipper is given a real opportunity to get the job remains to be seen. Skipper, 47, served as Fresno State's interim head coach last year and many in the industry expected him to get the full-time job. But a 6-7 finish sunk any chance he had. Could Skipper change his fate a year later? Industry sources are skeptical, but if Skipper continues to win he may force the administration's hands.   UCLA's search effort is fronted by athletic director Martin Jarmond and senior associate athletics director Erin Adkins, the same pair who led the abrupt 2023 search that led to DeShuan Foster. That pair will be assisted by a committee that is fronted by entertainment executive Casey Wasserman, former Warriors GM Bob Myers, former NFL pro Eric Kendricks and current Washington Commanders GM Adam Peters, each of whom are Bruin alums.   There is considerable industry doubt as to UCLA's investment in football. The Bruins have lagged considerably behind other Big Ten programs in NIL investment the last few seasons, per multiple sources, but the Bruins brass has indicated there will be additional investment for the new regime.   UCLA has already begun its initial round of conversations with potential candidates, per a source. Preliminary names that have come up early as possibilities include Washington's Jedd Fisch, North Texas' Morris, UNLV's Dan Mullen, Arizona's Brent Brennan and New Mexico's Jason Eck among others. Sources have indicated Florida State defensive coordinator Tony White, an alumnus who's been in the mix for multiple head jobs over the last few years, is interested. But the UCLA admin has communicated to agents that they'd prefer to hire a sitting head coach.   Quick note with Mullen: The 53-year-old, who is off to a 6-0 start, strongly denied interest in any other jobs when asked at a recent press conference.    \"Listen, I'll make it real simple. Want me to do that? I'm going to be the head coach at UNLV next year,\" Mullen said.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Virginia Tech  The Hokies' search committee includes former coaches Bruce Arians and Bud Foster in addition to former player Eddie Royal and multiple alums from the business world. The search had a bit of a false start when Arians went on the Pat McAfee Show and said the school was \"going to hire a general manager and get him in charge of football\" before they \"get into the coaching search\" in late September. The Hokies have since walked that back, according to athletic director Whit Babcock, who is not leading the search, but assisting it. That is due to feedback Virginia Tech received that its candidate pool would be limited if it took a GM-first hiring approach.   His longterm future in the job is a very open question according to industry sources as Virginia Tech looks to re-do its entire athletic department, including hiring a CEO-type leader of the department to modernize a department that multiple industry sources called \"outdated.\"   The Hokies are expected to start with sitting head coaches and then go from there, and have their own budgetary concerns. Recently, the school's board of rectors greenlit a $229.2 million infusion of funds over the next four years, with $47.1 million coming next year, and approximately $61 million in the next three years. But when looking into the funding sources, $30 million each year are due to come from fundraising efforts, which implies that the funds are not already on hand at the university.   Requests for comment by CBS Sports from multiple members of the board charged with designing the budget were not returned, but Babcock said on a school-produced podcast he is confident the athletic department can secure the funds.   \"We certainly have a high degree of confidence that we will operate with the additional $47.1 million budget resources committed to us this fiscal year and the out years too.\"  Babcock said athletics will be able to use fundraising staffers from the university side, which raised $225 million last year. Don't expect much more public comments from the search committee as it was reported the committee signed non-disclosure agreements and will no longer be speaking about it.   But industry sources do not discount the possibility of a return by South Carolina head coach Shane Beamer to Blacksburg, where his father's legacy looms large.   Asked about his possible interest in the Virginia Tech job in September, Beamer said: \"I think the week of the Virginia Tech game, I told everyone how I feel about South Carolina and my love for this place. That's where my focus is at right now, just getting our football team better.\" \n            ",

The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings.   Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Milwaukee Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr., who is barely being picked in the top 100 picks in many drafts. Despite struggling from deep through the first 45 games of last season with the Los Angeles Clippers, he turned things around in a big way once he was acquired by the Bucks. He finished the regular season connecting on 40.8% of his 3-pointers in his final 30 games with Milwaukee, averaging 11.7 points per game.In the postseason, he continued to light it up from deep, hitting on 46.7% of his 3-pointers, averaging 11.2 points in five games. Porter is expected to be the Bucks' starting point guard, and is just one of two players on the 2025-26 roster to average 2.9 assists or more. For his career, Porter has averaged 4.6 assists per game. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier, who has an ADP of 137. The No. 1 ranked prospect in the Class of 2023, Collier starred at USC for one season before being the 29th overall pick by Utah in 2024. He began as a backup but then wrestled the starting job away from Keyonte George, who was an All-Rookie selection the year prior. Collier really hit his stride towards the end of the season and averaged 15.9 points and 7.1 assists over his final seven games of his rookie year.Already one of the league's youngest teams, Utah then jettisoned vets Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton and John Collins in the offseason as it has fully embraced a youth movement. Thus, the 21-year-old Collier should have no shortage of opportunities, and he plays in an offense conducive for lots of stats. The Jazz ranked fifth in pace last season as they want to utilize those young legs to their advantage. The model slots Collier ahead of Klay Thompson and Jalen Suggs, despite those two being drafted earlier on average. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was one of the major pieces in a trade between the Wizards and Pelicans in the offseason. The 26-year-old now goes to New Orleans, where he'll have to be a bit more of a complimentary player to Zion Williamson. New Orleans also brings in two lottery picks -- Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears -- so Poole could lose some of his scoring opportunities as the season progresses. Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are being picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well. How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts. This player is a top-3 Fantasy option at his position and is ranked ahead of stars like Kevin Durant and Paolo Banchero. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings for every player, at SportsLine.So which 2025-26 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which forward shocks the NBA as a top-3 player in positional rankings? Visit SportsLine now to get 2025-26 Fantasy basketball cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that's nailed its Fantasy basketball picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets are in free fall, off to an 0-6 under first-year coach Aaron Glenn.New York's 2025 0-6 start is just the third such winless beginning to a season in team history along with the 1996 season (0-7) and the 2020 season (0-13). The Jets will certainly be in the midst of a rebuild next offseason or two, which puts the future of talented, 24-year-old running back Breece Hall up in the air. The 2022 second-round pick is set to become a free agent next offseason, and the team drafted promising Wisconsin running back Braelon Allen in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft a year ago. New York is projected to have the seventh-most effective cap space ($58.2 million) in the NFL next offseason, according to OverTheCap.com, but there's a decent chance the franchise won't prioritize that money on a running back next year with plenty of other holes to address. That's why it would make sense for the Jets to at least shop Hall around to see what they could get for the talented, well-rounded back. Which teams would make the most sense for Hall? Here is a look at five possible landing spots for the young running back ahead of the NFL's Nov. 4 trade deadline.\n\n        \n            \n                Alvin Kamara to Chiefs? New WR for Giants' Jaxson Dart? 10 NFL trades that should happen before 2025 deadline\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThe Chiefs could use more juice on offense, including an upgrade at running back since quarterback Patrick Mahomes is currently Kansas City's leading rusher with 222 yards this season. Isiah Pacheco has rushed for under 55 yards in every game this season, and he's gone 12 consecutive games without a rushing touchdown. He's second on the team in rushing with 214 yards this season. New York would certainly be happy to absorb as many draft picks as it can get amid a rebuild, and the Chiefs are obviously in win-now mode. Following an encouraging 30-17 victory over the Detroit Lions on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 6, this is a deal that Kansas City should look to make.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersThe Chargers offense is as beaten down with injuries as it gets with offensive tackle Rashawn Slater (torn patellar tendon, out for the season), offensive tackle Joe Alt (ankle), running back Omarion Hampton (ankle, on injured reserve) and wide receiver Derius Davis (knee) all wounded. Quarterback Justin Herbert could use some assistance, especially a reliable checkdown release valve out of the backfield given his ragged offensive line.\nHall could aid Herbert and the Chargers both in the ground game and through the air. Hall's 150 catches and 1,224 yards receiving since 2023 are both the second most in the entire NFL among running backs in that span while his seven receiving touchdowns in that time are tied for the fifth most at the position with Saquon Barkley. Los Angeles needs to inquire about Hall, especially since Hampton is on a rookie deal. Plus, he could be a nice mentor for their first-round rookie back.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers are all in on the 2025 season after signing 41-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers, signing 34-year-old cornerback Darius Slay, trading for soon-to-be 31-year-old cornerback Jalen Ramsey and trading for 30-year-old tight end Jonnu Smith. This is a team in win-now mode, and that approach is working for Pittsburgh thus far with the Steelers out to a 4-1 start and in first place in the AFC North. \nHowever, the Steelers currently have the fourth-worst run game in football, averaging just 84.0 yards rushing per game through six weeks. That's surprising considering Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith can typically scheme up a capable run game no matter who is in the backfield. Perhaps he and the Steelers are missing the between-the-tackles consistency Najee Harris provided them the prior four seasons when he went for over 1,000 yards each year from 2021 to 2024. Hall could complement the speedier Jaylen Warren to beef up the Pittsburgh rushing attack. Plus, the Steelers also have an extra third-round pick for 2026 thanks to trading wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys in the offseason. Not necessarily saying a third-round pick is the right price for a rental running back, but the Jets would likely be interested in that offer.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsThe Arizona Cardinals are off to a tough 2-4 start to the 2025 season, but their record is somewhat deceiving. All six of their games have been decided by seven points or fewer this season: they won their first two and are currently on a four-game losing streak. Pro Bowl starting running back James Conner suffered a season-ending ankle injury and 2024 third-round pick Trey Benson is now on injured reserve with a knee injury. \nThe Cardinals don't have much time to right the ship. If they want to get their run game back on track and potentially give Hall an extended tryout to be a part of their future plans, the trade makes sense given he is only 24 years old. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston TexansThe Houston Texans are 2-3 this season, but it's not their defense's fault. Coach DeMeco Ryans' unit is the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense, allowing just 12.2 points per game. That's the fewest points per game allowed by a team with a losing record through five games in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), per CBS Sports Research. On the other hand, Houston's offense is averaging just 21.6 points per game, 22nd in the league this season. They've been league average on the ground, averaging 116.2 rushing yards per game this year. Their offense sorely lacks juice with just 31 explosive plays this season, tied for the fifth-fewest in the NFL, per TruMedia. The Texans' nine explosive runs are tied for the seventh-fewest in the league in 2025. Quarterback C.J. Stroud is still on his rookie deal, and with Joe Mixon out and Nick Chubb not looking the same after multiple, serious knee injuries throughout his career, Houston should pursue Hall in an attempt to salvage its season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 WNBA season came to a close last week when the Las Vegas Aces completed a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercury in the Finals -- the league's first ever best-of-seven series  -- to win their third title in the last four years. While much remains up in the air about the 2026 season, it's never too early to start thinking about next season. The 2026 title odds have been released by Caesars, and to no surprise, the Aces have been installed as co-favorites alongside the Minnesota Lynx, who were the top seed in the 2025 playoffs. The Indiana Fever are just behind those two at +340. Here are the odds for all 15 teams, including the two expansion clubs that will join next season, the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo. 2026 WNBA title oddsTeamTitle oddsAces+325Lynx+325Fever+340Liberty+500Mercury+1000Dream+1500Storm+2000Valkyries+3500Sparks+4000Mystics+5000Wings+5000Sky+15000Sun+15000Fire+17500Tempo+17500This will be the most consequential offseason in league history. First and foremost, the Women's National Basketball Players Association and the WNBA are still negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, which is expected to bring substantial raises for all players, and perhaps a new economic model. As a result, nearly every veteran will be a free agent this winter. Kalani Brown and Lexie Brown are the only players not on rookie-scale deals who are under contract for 2026. There will also be a double expansion draft at some point, which will allow the Fire and Tempo to fill out their initial rosters. The date and exact rules for that event will not be known until the new CBA is in place, but however the process works, it will have a major impact on all of the current teams. Add in the draft and potential trades, and there figures to be more player movement than ever this winter. Rosters around the league could look substantially different, which makes it tricky to analyze the 2026 title odds in any serious depth at this point. Still, it's worth making note of a few things here. Should the Aces actually be the favorites?Except in rare circumstances, such as a star player retiring, the reigning champions in every sport are always the early favorites for the next season. Repeats are quite rare, though, and the Aces had a unique season. So while it's not a surprise to see them atop this list, it's fair to wonder if they should actually be the favorites. On the one hand, A'ja Wilson, the reigning MVP, co-Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP, will almost surely be back. Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray will probably return to Vegas as well, and they have an excellent coach in Becky Hammon and a supportive ownership group. They'll also have a chance to reset their depth after really struggling in that department for a few seasons. However, they weren't super convincing en route to their title. They were below .500 after the mid-point of the season, needed a last-second basket from Jackie Young in the deciding Game 3 of the first round to sneak past the Seattle Storm, were taken to overtime in the winner-take-all Game 5 of the semifinals by an extremely shorthanded Indiana Fever team and had some harrowing moments in the Finals against the Mercury. As long as Wilson, Young and Gray are back, the Aces are going to be in the mix next season, but it doesn't make sense to bet them at this number after the season they just had. Why the Fever are nearly co-favoritesThe Fever showed incredible resilience to get within five minutes of the Finals despite losing five players, including Caitlin Clark, to season-ending injuries. They upset the Atlanta Dream in the first round of the playoffs, then forced the Aces to overtime in the deciding Game 5 of the semifinals. They are just behind the Aces and Minnesota Lynx in the 2026 title odds, and at +340 are nearly co-favorites. Why?The Fever's youth is a major advantage this offseason. While you'd expect many stars to return to their current teams in free agency, nothing is guaranteed. But because Clark and Aliyah Boston are still on rookie scale deals, the Fever are guaranteed to return two of their best players. No other team has as much talent under contract for 2026If the Fever are able to re-sign Kelsey Mitchell, they'll have a terrific Big Three. They also have a top coach in Stephanie White, a rabid fanbase and an ownership group that is all in. They should be an attractive destination for free agents this winter and could easily have one of the best rosters in the league in 2026. The Fever's outsized popularity is another factor here. Just like the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Yankees and Dallas Cowboys in their respective sports, the sportsbooks know that more people are going to bet on the Fever than any other team, so they have to price their odds accordingly to avoid a massive liability. Are the Liberty being disrespected?The Liberty got off to a 9-0 start in 2025, but had major injury problems the rest of the way and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Mercury. A few days after their season-ending loss, they parted ways with long-time coach Sandy Brondello less than a year after she led them to the title. The Liberty currently do not have a coach, and their best players are all free agents. Still, it's a bit surprising that they have the fourth-best odds at +500. Their Big Three of Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones have all expressed interest in returning. The Liberty had a plus-21.2 net rating when those three were on the floor together this season and they went 13-0 in games they all started and finished. If those three do indeed return to Brooklyn, the Liberty are going to be a contender regardless of what happens with their coaching search and the rest of their roster. Betting on the title before free agency is obviously a risk, but you likely won't be able to get the Liberty at this number next spring. Valkyries are an interesting long shotThere were a lot of questions about the Valkyries' direction after their expansion draft last year, but they nailed every decision they've made, both on and off the court. They went 23-21 last season to earn the No. 8 seed and become the first expansion team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season. Natalie Nakase was named Coach of the Year, Veronica Burton was named Most Improved Player and they set WNBA records for average (18,064) and total (397.408) attendance. While they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Lynx, they walked off the court with their heads held high. No one knows what the Valkyries' roster is going to look like in 2026, but they've built an incredible infrastructure and have one of the most forward-thinking, aggressive ownership groups. Notably, during the press conference to officially announce the team back in 2023, Joe Lacob proclaimed that they would win a title within five years. Could they do so as soon as 2026? The sportsbooks clearly don't think so, as they've given them the eighth-best odds at +3500. With respect to Burton, the Valkyries do not have a true star player in place, which is the main reason for the title skepticism. They have an electric homecourt advantage, a great coach and play in the Bay Area, though, so it's well within the realm of possibility that they add some big names in free agency this winter. That makes them an interesting long shot right now. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        When trying to solve any issue, one of the first steps is identifying possible solutions. For the Jaguars and Travis Hunter, both parties know the keys to getting the No. 2 overall pick more involved in the offense.  Through six games, the Jaguars' rookie dual threat has caught 20 of 31 targets for 197 yards. He is still looking for his first touchdown entering Jacksonville's Week 7 showdown with the Rams in London. \"Scheming him open is part of it, No. 1,\" Jaguars coach Liam Coen said. Coen added that the Jaguars are prioritizing getting Hunter more involved in the offense. \"Our job as an offensive staff [is] to make sure we're putting him in the progression and putting him in the position to be No. 1 [option] a little bit more often in some ways. And then when he is the primary [option], we've got to throw and catch. We've got to make sure that we identify it, find him, be able to be at the right spot at the right time. So, I think it's a combination of a lot of those things that ultimately can all be controlled.\"\nWhile he hasn't been overly involved in the offense, Hunter has made an impact when he has gotten the ball. During the Jaguars' Week 5 over the Chiefs, Hunter caught each of his three targets for a season-high 64 yards. He made a nifty 44-yard catch early in the second half that led to Trevor Lawrence's game-tying touchdown run. Later in the game, Hunter caught an eight-yard pass that set up Cam Little's 52-yard field goal that gave the Jaguars their first lead in an eventual 31-28 win. \nIt's important to note that Hunter is being asked to contribute on both sides of the ball, something that hasn't been done at a high level in the NFL since his college coach -- Deion Sanders -- did so roughly 30 years ago with the Cowboys. Sanders, however, never caught more than 36 passes in a season; Hunter is currently on pace to catch 57 passes. While Coen and the Jaguars' coaching staff know what they have to do, Hunter is also aware of the things he can do to increase his productivity as a receiver. \"It is very important for me to be patient,\" Hunter said. \"Just got to let the game come to me. Coach is trying to dial up a couple things for me, and I've just got to continue to just work and just having the guys trust me because I'm doing my job every time.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Aaron Rodgers will get his induction into the Steelers vs. Bengals rivalry on 'Thursday Night Football' to kick off NFL Week 7. Several NFL prop picks will center on Rodgers, Jaylen Warren, DK Metcalf and other Steelers considering Cincy's poor defense, but Pittsburgh hasn't been a Steel Curtain on that side of the ball either. It ranks 27th in passing defense, so Joe Flacco, Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins will also be popular with NFL player props and Thursday Night Football betting.Rodgers has an NFL prop bar of 216.5 passing yards, after he threw for 235 yards in Week 6 and hit the Over. However, he went under this NFL prop total in three straight games prior to Sunday, and with Cincy possessing the No. 28 run defense, Pittsburgh may lean more on the ground game. With the same prop odds of -114 for the Over and Under, this may be one TNF prop to simply avoid altogether. Before betting any Bengals vs. Steelers props for Thursday Night Football, you need to see the Steelers vs. Bengals prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.You can make NFL prop picks at DraftKings, where you can get $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass. Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. For Bengals vs. Steelers NFL betting on Thursday Night Football, the Machine Learning Model  has evaluated the NFL player prop odds and provided Steelers vs. Bengals prop picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Cincinnati vs. Pittsburgh here.Top NFL player prop bets for Bengals vs. SteelersAfter analyzing the Steelers vs. Bengals props and examining the dozens of NFL player prop markets, the SportsLine's Machine Learning Model  says Bengals WR Chase goes Over 69.5 receiving yards (-114 at FanDuel). The Steelers have always struggled to contain Chase, who has at least 81 receiving yards in four straight versus Pittsburgh. He's averaged 98 receiving yards over this stretch, and many of those defenses were much better than this year's unit in Pittsburgh. The Steelers are giving up 178.8 receiving yards to opposing wideouts, which is the third-most in the NFL.Chase is also coming off 94-plus receiving yards in each of the last two weeks, and he showed great rapport with Flacco on Sunday, posting a stat line of 10-94-1. It's also important to note that Thursday's game will take place in Cincinnati, where Chase has gone over his receiving yardage prop in each of his last five home games, which includes a Week 13 contest versus the Steelers last season. The AI model projects Chase to have 86.8 receiving yards, giving this NFL prop bet a 4.5-star rating. See more NFL props here.New users can also target the FanDuel promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins:How to make NFL player prop bets for Bengals vs. SteelersIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has six additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better.

The Volunteers have been without their two top corners all season and it shows. Tennessee ranks 119th in pass defense, allowing 277 yards per game. Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson should feast on the Volunteers and strengthen his Heisman Trophy candidacy Saturday after facing tough defenses in Georgia, Vanderbilt and Missouri the last three weeks.\"Tennessee has allowed 30+ points in its three SEC games against Arkansas, Mississippi State and Georgia.

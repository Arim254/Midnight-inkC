Boise State tops the Mountain West and is coming off of a big 56-31 win against UNLV. Meanwhile, the Wolf Pack occupy the conference cellar and are looking for their first victory since Week 2 against Sacramento State. Kickoff from Mackay Stadium is set for 10 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network. The Broncos are 21.5-point favorites in the latest Boise State vs. Nevada odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 51.5.

The offense leads the Mountain West with 478.6 average yards per game and is holding opposing quarterbacks to 189.7 passing yards. Starting quarterback Maddux Madsen is coming off of a four-touchdown day against the Rebels where he also threw for 253 yards, and he should comfortably move the ball down field against a mediocre Nevada passing defense. Boise State's defense is allowing 351.3 total yards and 26.1 points per game but is expected to contain a weak Wolf Pack offense. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Nevada can coverThe Wolf Pack might be struggling overall, but they are still 3-4-0 ATS this season and have covered the spread in two of their last three games. That includes covering in a 24-22 loss to New Mexico as 13.5-point underdogs in Week 8. Nevada also covered as a 42.5-point underdog against Penn State in Week 1.

The entire Dodgers organization is sending our thoughts to the Vesia family, and we will provide an update at a later date.\"In light of the apparent gravity of the situation, Vesia's availability for the series against the Toronto Blue Jays that starts Friday is a secondary concern. Even so, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts on Thursday told reporters that the team is \"going day to day with no expectations\" insofar as Vesia's status for the World Series is concerned. This year, the 29-year-old left-hander made 68 appearances for the Dodgers during the regular season with an ERA of 3.02 and 80 strikeouts and 19 unintentional walks in 59 ⅔ innings. During the team's current playoff run, Vesia has a 3.86 ERA in 4 ⅔ innings. Over that span, he's allowed a run in only one of his seven appearances. Vesia has been a reliable fixture in the Dodger bullpen since they acquired him from the Miami Marlins via trade in February of 2021. \nGame 1 of the World Series is scheduled for Friday in Toronto at 8 p.m. ET.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's talent is not in question, but his methods are the subject of furious debate. His first two games of the 2025-26 season will do nothing to change that. On Thursday night, the reigning MVP showed exactly why he's the most frustrating player in the league to guard.Gilgeous-Alexander poured in a career-high 55 points in the Thunder's 141-135 double-overtime win over the Indiana Pacers -- the Thunder are the first team in NBA history to go to double-overtime in each of their first two games of a season -- on 15 of 31 from the field and 23 of 26 from the free throw line. He also added eight rebounds and five assists. His 55 points on Thursday were the third-most by a Thunder player since the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, and he's already up to 90 points for the season. Only Wilt Chamberlain, Anthony Davis and Michael Jordan have scored more in the first two games of a season in NBA history. \nGilgeous-Alexander is also already 33 of 40 from the free throw line. His 23 makes and 26 attempts against the Pacers were both career-highs, and his 40 attempts are the most by a player in the first two games of a season in NBA history. He obviously won't average 20 free throws over the course of the season, but he already has a massive lead in that department and is once again on pace to be among the league leaders. \nSince Gilgeous-Alexander emerged as an All-Star during the 2022-23 season, he has finished third, second and second in total free throw attempts over the last three seasons. During that time, only Giannis Antetokounmpo (2,261) has shot more free throws than Gilgeous-Alexander (2,057). No one else even had 1,700. Free throw attempts from 2022-23 to 2024-25 seasonPlayerFTAGiannis Antetokounmpo2,261Shai Gilgeous-Alexander2,057Luka Dončić1,697Trae Young1,607DeMar DeRozan1,576Jayson Tatum1,559At times, the discussion about Gilgeous-Alexander's ability to get to the line can go too far and overshadow his unique gifts as a scorer and athlete. Thursday night's showing, however, was a reminder of why it keeps coming up. It's not just that Gilgeous-Alexander shoots so many free throws -- it's how he gets to the line. Whereas Antetokounmpo bullies his way there with brute strength, Gilgeous-Alexander is a trickster. He fools defenders (and occasionally officials) with an array of hesitations, fakes and pivots. No player makes opponents shake their heads or raise their arms in dismay more often than Gilgeous-Alexander. The Pacers spent seven consecutive games guarding him in the Finals just a few months ago, and even they couldn't help but be deceived. Here's a sampling from Thursday. Aside from the third clip, perhaps, all of these are clear fouls. But that doesn't make them any less frustrating for the Pacers. \nJust look at Jarace Walker's face after the one in overtime. Jarace Walker wishing he hadn't bit on a Gilgeous-Alexander pump fake Nothing sums up the experience of trying to defend Gilgeous-Alexander better than that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Say this about the first three nights of the 2025-26 NBA season: It absolutely sucks that a federal gambling probe seemingly fell out of the sky to overshadow what has been one of the most electric starts to a season you could possibly imagine. First the Rockets and Thunder go to double-overtime on Tuesday. Then the Pacers take the Thunder, again, to double-overtime on Thursday. OKC, thanks to some incredible defense against Houston and a career-high 55 points from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at Indiana, escaped both with a win, and both times it was the Golden State Warriors waiting on the back end on of the national TV schedule for 12 quarters of OKC basketball to finish. On opening night, the Warriors discarded the Lakers despite 43 points from Luka Dončić. On Thursday, they backed that up with a 137-131 overtime victory over the Denver Nuggets, who were led by Aaron Gordon's unbelievable 50-point performance. Gordon, a career 33% 3-point shooter who came out of nowhere to shoot 44% last season, showed that it might not have been an anomaly as he canned 10 of his 11 triples and 17 of 21 field goals overall. How on earth could the Nuggets have lost a game in which Gordon, Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray combined for 96 points? \nI'll tell you how. His name is Stephen Curry. If you're looking for signs that Curry has fallen off, even slightly, in his 17th season at 37 years old, you better get out one hell of a high-powered microscope. The guy went for 42 points, 35 of which came in the second half and overtime, with six 3-pointers, single-handedly lifting Golden State with 16 straight points over a six-minute run spanning the end of the fourth quarter and the start of overtime. From the 2:42 mark of the fourth quarter, Curry outscored the Nuggets, 18-15, all by himself. Multiple times the Nuggets looked like they were about to put the game on ice, and Curry just wouldn't let it happen. With under two minutes to play in regulation and the Warriors down three, he did this:\nWith 25 seconds left and the Warriors again down three, he did this:\nHe started overtime with another 3, and sealed the deal with a bucket and a pair of free throws in the closing 25 seconds of overtime to push the Warriors to 2-0 with the sort of \"what the hell did I just watch?\" performance that only he can pull off. \nWhat's crazy is Curry only had seven points at halftime. Even at this advanced stage of a career that continues on an upward trend toward one of the five best in history, he can still go from zero to 100 faster that any player probably ever. Still, at 37 years old, it feels like he can wake up from a nap and hit the nuclear button whenever he wants. He tossed in seven assists, six rebounds and three steals for fun. \nSeriously, Curry has not lost one mph on his fastball. If anything, he's actually better now than ever. Maybe not quite as shifty, but still among the shiftiest players alive with his handle and ability to leverage the threat of his shot into downhill advantages, where he's as strong as he's ever been in terms of finishing through contact. And the shooting? Obviously that's still there. As is his seemingly endless supply of energy to stay on the move with an entire defense chasing him for as long as it takes to get a shot, and ultimately, a win. This guy is out of this world. I know I'm not breaking any news with that statement, but good grief. What an absolute treat it is to still be watching him do his this after all these years, and also to know that he's far from done.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill had his season come to an abrupt halt in Week 4 when the eight-time Pro Bowl pass-catcher suffered a devastating knee injury in the win over the New York Jets. Hill dislocated his knee, and tore multiple ligaments, including his ACL. When Hill was loaded onto the cart and driven off the field, he was seen clapping his hands and smiling. Hill waved to the crowd and blew kisses to fans as well. It was an odd reaction after a painful, season-ending injury, but there was a reason behind it. During a recent appearance on Terron Armstead's podcast, \"The Set,\" Hill said that after he realized his leg was \"crooked,\" he immediately felt grateful for all the incredible moments football has given him, and thought about the time he would now have to spend with his family. \"So I immediately started laughing man, because I feel like I've been able to play this game my whole entire life, and I've been blessed with great talents and great gifts, and the amount of support that I get from my family is amazing, man,\" Hill said. \"I really wasn't even thinking about the injury. I was just thinking about the great times I've had playing this game and just me being in Miami. It all came full circle. I know this (wasn't) it, but I was just happy bro. Because I'm always trying to find the good in everything. I get time to think about my kids, I get time to travel, I get time to like really sit down and enjoy my life and not always train.\"\nHill said his entire life has been about training, living in the gym, on the track, on the jugs machine. He wasn't sacrificing his time for his family or other things he wanted to do. Now, he has this opportunity to get close to his kids, go to church on Sundays and improve the man he is off the field.Anytime a 31-year-old speedster suffers an injury like the one Hill did, it's fair to wonder if his football career could be over. Armstead asked what Hill's response is to the doubters out there, and he had a pretty surprising yet honest answer.  \"Well, at the end of the day, I feel like that decision is all based upon how I feel and where my mindset is at the moment,\" Hill said. \"Like right now, I'm happy. I'm happy with being with my kids, I'm happy with the career that I've had. I love playing football. I love it, but it takes a lot. It takes a lot to be the best and to stay at the top and make a lot of money and help your team win games and stuff like that. It takes a lot. It takes a lot on you mentally, it takes a lot on you physically. I'm at the point now where I need to have a conversation with mom, family, everybody ... I don't want to make any rash decisions, obviously. I just want to be in the moment.\"\nHill says rehab is going well and he's attacking every day. Following the injury, Hill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said that the goal is to be ready for Week 1 in 2026. When or if Hill returns, it likely won't be with the Dolphins. CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported that the Dolphins are expected to release Hill prior to the start of the new league year in March. Hill has $29.9 million in non-guaranteed base salary on the books next year, but $16 million is guaranteed on the third day of the new league year, March 14, 2026. If Hill's football career is over, it was one remarkable ride. \"Cheetah\" was the fastest receiver of his time. He won a Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs, was named a First Team All-Pro five times and led the NFL in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns in 2023. In six of Hill's 10 NFL seasons, he crossed 1,000 yards receiving. In his first two seasons with Miami, Hill became the first player in NFL history to cross 1,700 yards receiving multiple times, and caught 20 total touchdowns. \nAs Hill explained, the time to make a decision on his football future is not right now. It's about living in the moment off the field. \n            ",

The former Oregon standout has quickly established himself as one of the premier young signal-callers in the NFL. In the 2024 season, he threw for 3,870 yards, completing 65.9% of his passes, tossed 23 touchdowns and only three interceptions, finishing with a 101.7 passer rating. He gets to face a Vikings defense in which its last five offensive touchdowns allowed have come via the passing game.Through the early portion of the 2025 campaign, he has already totaled 1,913 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, and six interceptions in seven games while leading the league in passing yards. Despite his impressive production, Herbert has been selected to the Pro Bowl just once, back in 2021, which many consider an underrepresentation of his talent. His combination of arm strength, pocket awareness, and mobility has made him the centerpiece of the Chargers' offense under coach Jim Harbaugh, and he continues to trend toward the elite tier of NFL quarterbacks. See who else to roster right here.\nPart of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson. The former LSU standout has rapidly ascended into the elite tier of NFL wide receivers, already earning four Pro Bowl selections by the 2024 season. In 2024, he caught 103 passes for 1,533 yards and 10 touchdowns, continuing his streak of five consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. In the 2025 campaign he's maintained that high standard, posting 34 receptions for 528 yards and one touchdown in limited play so far, with an impressive 15.5 yards per catch.

    "body": "\n        As Abby Wambach nodded the ball downwards in the penalty area at Subaru Park 15 years ago, Alex Morgan – in her trademark pink, DIY pre-wrap headband – made a well-timed run and came through with a simple finish, a perfect set-up for her first international goal. In retrospect, Morgan described it as \"the start of something great,\" almost an understatement for what came next.Morgan went on to score 123 goals for the U.S. women's national team, earn 220 caps over 14 years, win two Women's World Cups and an Olympic gold medal along the way – and those are only her accolades on the international stage. Her on-field accomplishments are just one aspect of the collection of great moments that made up her USWNT career, though. Morgan will return to the stadium where she scored her very first international goal on Thursday nearly 15 years to the day, taking part in one final retirement ceremony after she hung up her cleats last year. Instead of the 2,505 who filled the venue the day of her debut USWNT goal, though, Morgan will likely be greeted by a full house, the legacy she leaves behind in full view.\n\"I think for everyone on this team, she's just a hero for all of us and I think is someone who epitomizes what it means to leave something better than you found it,\" midfielder Sam Coffey, whose USWNT rise came towards the end of Morgan's national team career. \"I grew up watching her. I think every young girl growing up and playing, you're like, 'I love Alex Morgan!' I had a poster of her up on my wall. I had to take it down recently in my childhood bedroom.\"Morgan will be a spectator to a new-look version of the USWNT on Thursday in a friendly against Portugal, the first game in head coach Emma Hayes' preparation for next year's Women's World Cup qualification tournament. Hayes' youth-skewing team is made up of players who had her example to follow growing up, supported by a handful of veterans who have been tasked with instilling the USWNT's longstanding competitive and winning culture to the newcomers. Before Coffey and Rose Lavelle became the players responsible for passing on wisdom, there was Morgan and an entire generation of stars who shared the tricks of a very unique trade with them.\"I've been saying she and all these players that have been retiring recently, that's who taught us how to be excellent in this environment and I think that's what we try to consistently match and uphold,\" Lavelle, a member of the 2019 World Cup-winning team, said. \"I think it's the reason that this this program has been in such a good spot, is because of that legacy on the field that they've all left so I think she's taught me so much and I think now being in a position where I'm now a veteran leader, having her to look up to and learn from leading up to this moment has really been huge and has put all of us in a better position to be the best version of ourselves.\"\nIt is almost difficult to recall a time when Morgan was not a larger-than-life figure in women's soccer. She went from a player on the rise to a bonafide star in almost no time, breaking out during the 2011 Women's World Cup, the team's run to the final commanding a new level of attention that has not waned since. Morgan inherited the attention Mia Hamm left behind, becoming not only the face of the team but of the sport as a whole less than a year after scoring her first international goal in the Philadelphia suburbs. She was the rare professional women's soccer player who became a household name, always boasting the on-field credentials to back it up.\"There was nothing she didn't achieve,\" Hayes, who worked with Morgan briefly as the USWNT coach, said. \"She was a player that epitomized what this program is about. An unbelievable credit to her family because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none. You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan and I think this sport should show a lot of gratitude to that because it's important for our players to be recognizable and she is, without question, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport. … She's got so many telling moments that were difference-making moments in her career and the impact she's had on this team is immeasurable.\"Morgan's true greatness, though, lies in the fact that she coupled her unprecedented profile with the will to create meaningful change. Her legacy will always be two-fold, impressively becoming a rare athlete to leave such an indelible mark on the sport they played. She was not only the face of the USWNT as they won two World Cups; she was one of its faces as they waged an equal pay battle with the U.S. Soccer Federation that finally ended in a hard-fought victory with a historic settlement in 2022. Many of the players on the current roster have only ever known the pleasure of sharing equal working conditions with their USMNT counterparts and full stadiums, the potential of what women's soccer now fully visible for anyone to see.\n\"I think what she's done and continued to do for women's sports in general has been huge,\" Lavelle said, \"and I think we've all benefitted greatly from that and hopefully we can continue to pass on that legacy in the same way but it's huge shoes to fill.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We're at the point of the college football season where teams are who they are. Sure, there are rare cases where you see mediocre teams level up, or great teams fall apart, but for the most part, we know who's who in the zoo.That team that's struggled to block all year? Yeah, they're probably not going to figure it out this week. The quarterback who has struggled against the blitz? He will continue to struggle against the blitz.You can bet college football games this week at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager. Claim your offer here:In theory, it makes it easier to figure out how matchups will play out. In reality, the folks setting the lines know all of this stuff, too. Still, there are a few games this week on the board I'm feeling confident about, which isn't something I've been able to say much this season. I mean, the results in this column speak for themselves.\nGames of the Week\nNo. 8 Ole Miss at No. 13 Oklahoma: When you think of Ole Miss' offense, you don't typically think of the team's rushing attack first because Lane Kiffin and company have done such a great job of scheming explosive plays in the passing attack during their tenure. This season has been no exception. The Rebels' offense ranks 19th nationally in explosive pass rate. The rushing attack ranks 77th in explosive rate, but while it's not ripping off huge chunks, it's been something the Rebels have routinely relied on to move the ball.In their first six games, all of which were wins, Ole Miss averaged 204 rushing yards per game. Last week, Georgia took it away. Ole Miss rushed for 88 yards and only 3.7 yards per carry. It lost. Now, some of that was Ole Miss not throwing often, but when you look under the hood, it's not difficult to see that the Rebels' worst games have all come when they had their lowest EPA per rush efforts.This week, they're facing an Oklahoma defense that ranks fifth nationally in EPA per rush allowed and second in success rate against the run. Honestly, Oklahoma's defense is great at everything. It's much better than the Georgia unit Ole Miss faced last week, and being at home, I suspect the Oklahoma defense will do a better job of slowing Ole Miss down than any other team. The fact that this is Ole Miss' second consecutive road game won't help matters for the Rebels, either.\nOffensively, Oklahoma has not been nearly as impressive. Essentially, the Sooners' offense is \"Mateer or bust.\" He either makes it happen or he doesn't. This feels like a matchup where Mateer can make it happen enough to get the Sooners what they need, and it also feels like a game where Oklahoma's defense can earn the offense some short field opportunities. For all the Sooners' struggles on offense, when they get in scoring range, they finish drives in the end zone frequently. The Pick: Oklahoma -4.5 (-115) at Fanduel\nNo. 3 Texas A&M at No. 20 LSU: Earlier, when I wrote about a team that hasn't been able to block anybody all season, and won't learn how to block, LSU was most definitely a team I had in mind. When LSU's offense got off to a slow start to the season, there were plenty of available excuses. They began the year on the road against Clemson and were replacing four starters on the offensive line. You figured that as the competition eased a bit and those guys gained experience, they'd figure it out.Even if we remove Clemson from the equation, LSU's offensive line hasn't figured out anything other than how to let a defender get past them in new and sometimes exciting ways. Garrett Nussmeier has been under fire all season long and looks like a soldier who has been at war for too long. Now the Tigers are facing yet another excellent defense in A&M, and I don't think being at home in Tiger Stadium at night will be enough to overcome the reality of the situation.\nDefensively, the Tigers are good enough to keep them in games, but at some point, the dam will burst. It would not surprise me if that point was this weekend, because this is an Aggies offense that's not easy to deal with. They aren't truly elite at anything, but they're good at everything, and those teams are tough to stop. You look to take one thing away, and they just do the other thing.These are the things you can do when you have a good offensive line, and A&M's is one of the best in the country. Marcel Reed has taken steps forward as a passer, but a big reason why is that he rarely finds himself under duress while in the pocket. The few times he is, he's able to escape because he's one of the best scramblers in the country. And that's another thing that will break a defense's will. When you do everything right to get the stop and then the QB just takes off and picks up the first down, it's mentally deflating.I would never rule out LSU at home. It's certainly possible the Tigers' defense can force a bunch of turnovers and make this game a rock fight that allows the offense to squeeze just enough points to win, but that outcome isn't nearly as likely as the Aggies winning. The Pick: Texas A&M -2.5 (-115) at DraftKings\nLock of the Week\nNo. 11 BYU at Iowa State: Iowa State comes into this game on a two-game losing streak, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise. It's hard to win games when you suffer as many injuries as this team has on both defense and special teams. If you didn't know, the Cyclones have spent games without a kicker in recent weeks, and they've lost multiple cornerbacks to injury. Last year, this team dealt with injuries to every linebacker within 100 square miles of Ames, Iowa, but was able to overcome them.Well, no shade to linebackers, but in this era of football, it's easier to scheme around your linebackers than it is your corners.What's truly concerning about this matchup in particular is what happened a couple of games ago. Iowa State gave up 260 yards on the ground against Cincinnati in a 38-30 loss. While they aren't exactly the same, there are a lot of similarities between the Bearcats' offense and the BYU offense the Clones will face here.\nBYU ranks sixth nationally in EPA per rush and ninth in explosive rush rate. They also run the ball a lot, as their 60.8% rush rate is the ninth-highest rate in the country. I expect the Cougars will find success running the ball here, even if I do worry about a possible letdown coming off last week's Holy War win against Utah. The Pick: BYU +3 (-112) at DraftKingsOver of the Week\nBaylor at No. 21 Cincinnati: I'm not sure there's a more slept-on team in the country right now than the Cincinnati Bearcats. Like BYU, they're undefeated in the Big 12, and if not for one bad decision by Brendan Sorsby late in the season-opener against Nebraska, the Bearcats might be undefeated period. Well, Sorsby hasn't made a mistake since and is putting up exceptional numbers that nobody is paying attention to.My thought here is that Cincinnati's offensive prowess will once again be on display against Baylor because everybody's offensive prowess is on display against Baylor. You know that Auburn offense that hasn't cracked 20 points in SEC play this season? It put up 38 against Baylor! The only team Baylor has held below 27 points this season is Samford. FBS opponents are averaging 35.5 points per game against the Bears.\nThe Bears' only defense is their offense. It's not as explosive or efficient as Cincinnati's has been, but that's mostly because the Bears don't run the ball as effectively. They throw it pretty dang well, and Cincinnati's defense ranks 103rd nationally in EPA per dropback. The Pick: Over 66.5 (-115) at DraftKingsMACtion of the Week\nUMass at Central Michigan: Sometimes it's as simple as finding the worst team in the world and betting against them. Perhaps UMass isn't the worst team in the world, but it's the worst team in the FBS, and I can't help but wonder about its mental state right now. Last week, the Minutemen held a 21-20 lead over Buffalo in the fourth quarter but missed a field goal that would've given them a 24-20 lead. They recovered by getting an interception with 59 seconds left in the game.The first win of the season was so close they could taste it. The Minutemen were then hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that put them in second-and-20. The next thing you knew, it was fourth-and-24 at the UMass 5-yard line, and only 10 seconds had come off the clock. You know what happened next. They punted, and the Bulls went 50 yards in 20 seconds for the game-winning touchdown.\nCan UMass get off the mat after that? I don't know. Even if they do, I don't know if they can hang with the Chippewas, who look like one of the better teams in the MAC this season. The Pick: Central Michigan -15.5 (-115) at FanduelUpset of the Week\nBall State at Northern Illinois: Let's stay in the MAC a little longer so we can fade a favorite that hasn't done a whole lot to deserve being favored this year. It's one thing when a MAC team struggles in nonconference play, because they're often playing much stronger programs. For instance, Miami (Ohio) started the season with losses to Wisconsin, Rutgers and UNLV, getting outscored 103-55, but they're 3-0 in MAC play and have outscored opponents 89-51.One of those opponents was Northern Illinois, which started the season slowly and has continued moving slowly. The Huskies are winless in MAC play, including a loss to an Eastern Michigan squad that hasn't looked very good itself. Yes, they're home here, but if you were to ask the Huskies what the one thing they do well is, I don't know that they'd have an answer for you. It used to be running the football, but they've been worse in the MAC than they were coming in! Don't get me wrong. I don't look at Ball State as some kind of juggernaut being slept on, but that's an awfully big price on the Cardinals considering how Northern Illinois has looked all season. After all, the Cardinals beat the Ohio team that beat Northern by 27 last week. The Pick: Ball State (+185) at DraftKings\nBetsLast WeekSeasonUnitsGames of the Week2-08-8-1.75Lock of the Week1-02-6-4.61Upset of the Week0-11-7-5.07Overall3-322-26-7.25SportsLine's proven computer model has simulated every Week 9 college football game 10,000 times. Visit SportsLine now to see all the picks, all from the model that is 42-30 since the beginning of last season on top-rated money-line and over/under picks. \n            ",

The Athletic reports that Lawson will be added to the practice squad. Lawson, who turned 30 this offseason, spent 2024 with the Dallas Cowboys. In 15 games played with three starts, he recorded 15 tackles, 15 QB hits and five sacks. Lawson makes his return to the AFC North, as he was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of Auburn. Lawson spent his first four NFL seasons with the Bengals and recorded 20 sacks in his first 51 games played. That includes 8.5 sacks notched in his very first NFL season. In 2021, Lawson signed a three-year, $45 million deal with the New York Jets but suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in training camp. He bounced back to record seven sacks in 2022.\n        \n            \n                Steelers' Aaron Rodgers says he will end his career 'with Green Bay' ahead of Sunday's showdown vs. Packers\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Ravens are certainly in need of some help at pass rusher, as defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike is tied for the team lead in sacks with two and hasn't played since Week 2. Additionally, Baltimore traded pass rusher Odafe Oweh to the Los Angeles Chargers for safety Alohi Gilman earlier this month in a deal that included a couple of Day 3 picks. The eight total sacks the Ravens have recorded this season is tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars for fewest in the NFL.\nUp next for the Ravens are the Chicago Bears, who have won four straight games after beginning the season 0-2. Baltimore's defense enters Week 8 ranked third-worst in yards allowed per game (380.8). \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Bengals linebacker Logan Wilson wants out of Cincinnati, as ESPN reported on Thursday that the 29-year-old has requested a trade.Wilson has started in all seven games played this season, but he has seen his snap count decrease recently. After playing 100% of the team's defensive snaps in the Week 5 loss to the Detroit Lions, Wilson played just 19.7% in the Week 6 loss to the Green Bay Packers and 45.6% in the Thursday night win over the Pittsburgh Steelers.The Bengals appear poised to move forward with rookies Barrett Carter and Demetrius Knight Jr. as their starting linebackers. Knight, who was selected by Cincinnati in the second round, has played the majority of defensive snaps in every game this season, and is tied for the team lead in tackles with 50. Carter, who was a fourth-round pick out of Clemson, played just 18.4% of defensive snaps in Week 1, but has played every snap on defense in the last two games.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL trade deadline tiers: Which big-name stars and surprise candidates could be dealt?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite the change in snap count, Carter told ESPN that Wilson has continued to be a great leader. \n\"It hasn't changed our relationship at all,\" Carter said. \"I still lean on him heavily with stuff, still ask him questions every single day. He's been a great leader, just like the man he is since the day I got here.\"Wilson was a third-round pick of the Bengals in 2020 out of Wyoming. He became a full-time starter in his second NFL season, which was the year Cincinnati made its run to Super Bowl LVI. In four playoff games that postseason, Wilson recorded 39 tackles, three passes defensed and one interception. That 2021 season marked the first of four straight in which Wilson recorded 100 combined tackles. In 2023, Wilson signed a four-year extension that was worth up to $37.25 million. He responded with a career year, racking up 135 combined tackles, five tackles for loss, one sack, two forced fumbles, nine passes defensed and four interceptions. \nNow he's one of the players that could be moved before the Nov. 4 trade deadline. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        We've now seen all 30 NBA teams play at least one game. The Thunder and Warriors have gone twice. Does that mean we can say anything meaningful about the 2025-26 season? Maybe. Maybe not. Last year, the Hornets beat the Rockets on the road. Charlotte wasn't the surprise No. 2 seed among those teams. Both of the Tuesday matchups were won by teams that would eventually lose to those same opponents in the playoffs -- the Lakers to the Timberwolves and the Celtics to the Knicks. Again, not exactly predictive. But there were at least a few games that gave us meaningful insight.The Cleveland Cavaliers dropped 136 points in a 30-point decimation of the Toronto Raptors, for instance. They had the best offense in the league across a 64-win season while the Raptors tanked. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander beat Nikola Jokić on the road and then took his MVP award. Opening night is the first real opportunity for players and teams to show the world what they spent the summer working toward. Sometimes it takes a while, as it did for the Rockets. Sometimes it's immediate, as it was for the Cavaliers.We have a whole season to offer measured takes on reliable samples. Opening night is for overreactions. So let's go through each of these games in search of one extreme takeaway. Will any of these pan out? Well, if last year is any indication, some of them will, and others will look ridiculous. This is the NBA. It's an ever-changing league, and it's better to be too early on these changes than too late.NBA opening night overreactionsNuggets-Warriors: Nikola Jokić will have his first All-Star teammateIt was a Twilight Zone sort of night for the Nuggets. They made it to overtime despite losing Jokić's minutes. Aaron Gordon chipped in 50 points, but Denver lost because Jokić had a miserable shooting night. Still ... Aaron Gordon scored 50 points, and he did so on a career-best 10 3-pointers. He was a 29% 3-point shooter as recently as two years ago, but after making 43.6% of his triples last season, it's fair to be optimistic that Thursday's shooting is at least somewhat sustainable.\nMeanwhile, Jamal Murray scored 25 points on 11-of-20 shooting. That might not sound especially notable, except that for his career, Murray has averaged only 10.5 points in season openers. He's a notoriously slow starter, especially lately because of injuries. But if Murray is healthy and Gordon is making 3s, the Nuggets won't need Jokić to be Superman every night. If Thursday was any indication, they'll be able to carry enough of the load to not only keep him fresher throughout the season, but also give him the first All-Star teammate(s) of his career.Pacers-Thunder: Bennedict Mathurin is the Most Improved Player favoriteBennedict Mathurin was drafted into pretty unusual circumstances. He immediately joined a team that had just acquired its franchise player. That franchise player plays a specific sort of basketball, and his team rose to prominence in part by surrounding him with teammates who fit that style. It was an awkward fit. Mathurin needs the ball in his hands to thrive. He's an athletic, slashing scorer, one that sometimes stood out on the freewheeling Pacers for his shot-selection and ball-dominance.But with Tyrese Haliburton injured, the Pacers don't have any choice but to put the ball in Mathurin's hands, and in his first game as one of Indiana's primary scorers, he soared, scoring 36 points against the best defense in the league. Last season, the only two players to do that against the Thunder were Fred VanVleet and Stephen Curry, both of whom did so on at least five made 3-pointers. Mathurin did it by barreling towards the basket, drawing 17 free-throw attempts in what was almost one of the best season-opening victories in Pacers history. They may have lost the game, but if this is Mathurin taking that crucial next step, they'll wind up winning the war. He flashed star upside on Thursday, and he'll have 81 more chances to show voters he deserves a trophy for it.\nMavericks-Spurs: Victor Wembanyama is the best player in the worldLook past the numbers for a moment. I know that's going to be difficult on a night in which Wembanyama scored 40 points, pulled in 15 rebounds, blocked three shots and made over 70% of his shots, but his stat lines are always gaudy.What we saw on Wednesday was different.This was no longer a baby bird spreading its wings. This was a dragon laying waste to any who would dare oppose him. The entire theory of the Dallas Mavericks was to build a team so gigantic that nobody could score against it. Wembanyama made it look easy. How many 7-5 centers have you ever seen pump fake into a drive that ended in a reverse dunk? How about blocking an opposing center on one end and then crossing him up for a four-point play on the other?\nHe's running the floor like a small forward now, but he's added enough bulk to bully centers. When Anthony Davis is so lost against you that he has no option but to foul, you know you're doing something right. Maybe Nikola Jokić is still more valuable. Maybe Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hoists the trophy again at the end. But Victor Wembanyama's season 3 premiere made the impossible look routine. No one else on Earth can do what he does. If he isn't the best player in the NBA today, he will be in the very near future.\nTimberwolves-Trail Blazers: Minnesota is still light on playmakingYes, the Timberwolves won, and yes, Anthony Edwards was spectacular with 41 points, but this game was closer than the Timberwolves likely suspected in part because this team remains light on playmaking. They assisted on only half of their 42 field goals and committed 19 turnovers. With Donte DiVincenzo replacing Mike Conley in the starting lineup and Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr. expected to take on bigger roles this season, the Timberwolves are seemingly moving away from traditional point guards. Yes, 41 points from Edwards are nice. He's capable of playing hero. But given the construction of this roster, the Timberwolves need more than one assist out of Edwards if they're going to get by the many Western Conference teams that are better than the Blazers.Kings-Suns: Signing Russell Westbrook was a mistakeIt's a bit cliche to blame Russell Westbrook, especially after a single game. The problem here is less what he did on the court, though a 2-of-8 shooting night in 19 minutes was hardly encouraging. The issue here is what he does to Sacramento's roster. He got on the floor before Keon Ellis, the only reliable defender the Kings have, and that in turn limited Ellis to only 13 minutes. Meanwhile, the Kings closed their loss to the Suns with Dylan Caldwell, a two-way player, at center. Westbrook's slot on the team probably should have gone to a defensive-minded big man. The roster is enormously unbalanced. They have too many players who need the ball and not enough frontcourt players to do the dirty work. Westbrook's reputation affords him playing time that this specific roster needs to be spending elsewhere. Clippers-Jazz: The Clippers are too oldThe Clippers built the oldest roster in NBA history this offseason, and they likely felt justified in doing so because of how well their older players fared a year ago. James Harden was an All-Star and Kawhi Leonard looked like his peak self down the stretch, so they added Chris Paul, Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez to their basketball remake of The Expendables. Well, what happened when they tipped off on Wednesday? They were run off the floor by the younger, more athletic Jazz.\nThe Clippers scored just eight fast break points in defeat, and the starting trio of Leonard, Beal and Harden combined for only 30 points. Aside from Derrick Jones Jr., there isn't much athleticism to speak of here. The Clippers need to out-execute opponents largely on skill, and if there is any slippage whatsoever from where those players were a year ago, that's going to be very tough. They came out completely flat on opening night, and if that's a sign of where they are physically now, things are only going to get harder in the dog days of the schedule.Bulls-Pistons: Detroit doesn't have enough shootingMalik Beasley, as a reserve, was responsible for more than 30% of Detroit's made 3-pointers last season. To put that number into perspective, Stephen Curry was responsible for around 32% of Golden State's 3-pointers in 2021, the year he played without Klay Thompson. The Pistons hoped that Duncan Robinson would be enough to replace his shooting, but Robinson hasn't made 40% of his 3s since 2021 and he missed all five of his attempts on Wednesday. Robinson is virtually unplayable when his shots don't go in, but the Pistons have no choice.Considering how much they have invested in Ausar Thompson and Jalen Duren, who are non-shooters, they need Robinson to space the floor properly. They got the worst of both worlds on Wednesday, as Robinson did little for their offense while suffering defensively. Meanwhile, Cade Cunningham spent the game driving into traffic en route to an 8-of-24 shooting performance. The Pistons are at least one shooter short right now, but given how historic Beasley was a year ago, even that might not be enough to lift this offense.\nGrizzlies-Pelicans: Ja Morant will return to the All-Star GameJa Morant more or less lost the 2023-24 season to injuries and suspension. He was back on the court last season, but injuries continued to weaken him, and so did a revamped offense that all but removed the pick-and-roll. His 11.4 paint points per game and 6.4 free throw attempts per game both represented meaningful dips from his 2022 peak, when he made his first All-Star Game. But with Tuomas Iisalo now locked in as head coach and an offseason of recovery behind him, Morant put up 20 paint points and eight free-throw attempts against the Pelicans on Wednesday, en route to 35 points on the night.\nEverything Morant does offensively flows out of his ability to get to the basket and get to the line, and Iisalo has reconfigured the offense to maximize his opportunities to do so. This version of Morant is an All-Star, and if he can play like this when half of his team is injured, he'll only get stronger as the season progresses.Bucks-Wizards: Khris Middleton is back!The Bucks are ineligible for any overreactions by virtue of having played the Wizards. We're not even going to pretend to take anything away from their opening performance. But a former Buck that was on the other side Wednesday? That's fair game. Can you guess the last time Khris Middleton scored 23 points in an NBA game? I'm almost certain you can't, because it wasn't even last season. No, it was Game 4 of Milwaukee's five-game loss to Indiana in the 2024 postseason.\n\n        \n            \n                Khris Middleton shows love to Bucks fans in return to Milwaukee: 'I think that's every player's dream'\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA variety of injuries tore Middleton down to the point that he was essentially just salary filler in the Kyle Kuzma trade last February. But Middleton looked healthier than he has in quite some time with his 9-of-14 shooting performance against the Bucks on Wednesday. He can't get to the rim like he used to, but he looked comfortable finding his patented mid-range looks against the Bucks, and if that persists, he immediately becomes a pretty interesting trade or buyout candidate come midseason.Hawks-Raptors: Toronto can build a viable offense without shootingThe 2024-25 Toronto Raptors never scored more than 133 points in a game. They scored 138 on opening night this season, and here's the kicker: They only shot 7-of-25 from 3-point range. This is Toronto in a nutshell. Dating back to the Nick Nurse years, they always lagged behind in shooting and playmaking, but made up for it by getting to the basket and scoring in transition. The Raptors had 34 fastbreak points on Wednesday to go along with 86 points in the paint. This is a weird group of players, and one that will probably need some mixing and matching from a lineup perspective. But they're big, athletic, and relentless defensively. They'll generate enough easy offense on that alone to survive, even if the shooting never quite comes around.76ers-Celtics: Philadelphia belongs to the guards nowJoel Embiid played 20 minutes, scored four points against arguably the NBA's thinnest front court and ultimately got benched for crunch time. His movement looked completely compromised. It should be panic time in Philadelphia, except VJ Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey just announced themselves as perhaps the most unguardable backcourt in the NBA.\n\n        \n            \n                Joel Embiid looks like a shell of himself during 20 painful minutes in 76ers' season-opening win vs. Celtics\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe pair combined to make 12 3-pointers on the way to their 74 points, and that shooting makes their elite speed that much more lethal. Philadelphia's big man may be slow and relatively unathletic at this stage of his career, but the 76ers can build a new identity around their backcourt's skill and dynamism. A star was born in Edgecombe on Wednesday, and Maxey reaffirmed that status for himself after an injury-plagued tanking year.Knicks-Cavaliers: Mike Brown and Leon Rose fixed the benchIf Tom Thibodeau had his way, his teams would rely on only five players. Maybe four. Luol Deng can play two positions at once, right? Mike Brown was hired in part to make the most of a bench built with limited resources, and he did just that in their 119-111 win against Cleveland. The Knicks used 11 players against the Cavaliers on Wednesday, and with Mitchell Robinson and Josh Hart injured, that meant every player with a standard contract except Pacôme Dadiet and Mohamed Diawara saw real action. The result? The Knicks got 35 points from their bench after averaging a league-low (by a country mile) 21.7 a year ago.\nEvery reserve except Landry Shamet had a positive plus-minus. Ariel Hukporti stood out starting in Robinson's place early on thanks to his energy and rebounding, but just about everyone did their part for the Knicks in their season-opening victory.\nMagic-Heat: Orlando will end its 13-year streak as a bottom-10 offenseDeath, taxes and bad Orlando offense. The Magic have ranked in the bottom 10 offensively 13 years in a row. That's what compelled their offseason blockbuster for Desmond Bane, and against a stout Miami defense, Bane absolutely delivered. His 23 points obviously helped, but really, just having a threatening shooter on the floor changed everything for this offense. After ranking 24th in the NBA with 45.8 paint points per game a season ago, the Magic dropped 56 on a Heat frontline led by star defender Bam Adebayo. If Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero can take the next step with this newfound space, the Magic won't just avoid the bottom-10, they might even sneak into the top 10.Hornets-Nets: Charlotte has its centersThe Hornets traded Mark Williams twice and Nick Richards once, and to the naked eye, it looked like they just didn't seek viable replacements. Well, it turns out, they've managed to fill the position for pennies on the dollar. Second-round rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner and former two-way player Moussa Diabaté combined to give Charlotte 23 points, 20 rebounds and three blocks in their 136-117 win over the Nets. Diabaté was a plus-minus darling on the defensive end a year ago, and Kalkbrenner won four consecutive Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards, so while they were pretty unheralded by typical NBA standards, the Hornets were justified in betting on them. That bet paid off on Wednesday. At least for now, they can roll forward with this duo.Thunder-Rockets: Alperen Sengun is an MVP candidateIt's been burbling all summer, especially at EuroBasket, where he drew comparisons to Nikola Jokić. Well, Tuesday was proof of concept. Alperen Sengun was for large stretches the best player on a court with Kevin Durant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, ultimately scoring 39 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in the Houston loss. He made a career-high five 3-pointers -- he'd previously topped out at three, and even that was a rarity. His finishing at the rim was a bit suspect last season, but he made four of his five restricted area shots against the Thunder. He led both teams with seven assists, no small feat considering he's playing on a roster with very little ball-handling or shooting.\n\n        \n            \n                Rockets haunted by glaring lack of point guard competence in season-opening defeat\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWe came into the season not knowing how Houston's offense would fare without Fred VanVleet. Tuesday gave us our answer: Through Sengun, and it's going to vault him into some very lofty conversations.Lakers-Warriors: Not even skinny Luka can fix this rosterHere's a distressing statistic: 97 of the 109 points scored by the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday were scored or assisted on by Luka Dončić or Austin Reaves. Not great. Neither is a home loss when your best player has a 43-point, 12-rebound, nine-assist stat line. The Lakers shot 8-of-32 from deep, distressing in percentage of course, but also in volume given how much JJ Redick has talked about hoisting 3s.\n        \n            \n                The Lakers keep making the same mistakes, but now the stakes are higher than ever for Rob Pelinka\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe perimeter defense was a mess, fouling Jimmy Butler constantly and doing little to impede Stephen Curry's movement. Deandre Ayton's debut was everything Blazers and Suns fans warned it could be. He demanded the ball too much, didn't get to the line, didn't rebound and didn't really mix it up near the basket much at all. Getting LeBron James back will help, but if the Lakers can't get the role players right, no amount of star power will matter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the Week 8 edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" the Los Angeles Chargers play host to the Minnesota Vikings.L.A. enters this game at 4-3 after dropping a wild game to the Colts last week, in which its defense got absolutely set in flames. The Chargers have now lost three of their last four since starting the season 3-0, and they're still dealing with a rash of injuries as they look to keep pace in the AFC West.You can bet Vikings vs. Chargers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Minnesota came out of its bye with a loss to the Eagles, dropping the Vikings back to .500 on the season. Two of their three wins have come against the Bengals and Browns, so they should be looking to prove that they can compete with actual competitive teams as they move into a considerably tougher stretch of schedule over the next two months.\nWhich of these two teams will bounce back and get into the win column? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Chargers vs. Vikings liveDate: Thursday, Oct. 23 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)Stream: Amazon PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chargers -3, O/U 44.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet NFL Week 8 games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.When the Vikings have the ballThe Vikings' passing game has, somewhat surprisingly, looked better with Carson Wentz under center than it did with J.J. McCarthy. Kevin O'Connell has been willing to pass the ball at a higher rate with Wentz in the lineup, and the backup QB has done a better job of both getting the ball out (his sack rate is less than half of McCarthy's) and getting it down the field to his pass-catchers than did the rookie during his early-season stint. \nWentz has had the advantage of having Jordan Addison in the lineup for three of his starts, while McCarthy didn't have him at all, and that's been of tremendous benefit to the offense. Addison has gone for 4-114-0, 5-41-1 and 9-128-0 in his three appearances, and he'd helped take advantage of the coverage rolled Justin Jefferson's way while also allowing more space for Jefferson himself to operate. Jefferson has gone for 22-328-0 in Addison's three games after totaling 12-200-1 in the three games prior to his return.But while Wentz has gotten the receivers going a bit, he's also unsurprisingly undermined the offense himself at times with ill-timed sacks and incomprehensible turnovers. He barely had to do anything in his first start against the Bengals thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns, and in his other three games, he has three touchdown passes against four interceptions. His pick-six against the Eagles last week was entirely inexplicable. Sometimes, he seemingly just has his processor go offline for a play or two or seven, and it looks like he hasn't played football before. \nAgainst a Chargers pass defense that ranks fourth in the NFL in success rate, that could be dangerous. Then again, we also saw the Chargers get absolutely torn apart by Daniel Jones last week, and part of their high success rate ranking is having played games against the Raiders, Broncos and Dolphins. So perhaps Wentz has more of a chance to get going here than it might appear on the surface. At the very least, O'Connell will scheme him into position for success, and then it's up to him to take advantage of being put in those good situations.\nThe Vikings may have more luck running the ball against a Chargers front that has gotten licked to the tune of 5.1 yards per carry and the league's third-highest rushing success rate. Jordan Mason should probably be expected to lead the backfield whether Aaron Jones returns from his hamstring injury or not (he's listed as questionable), and Mason has averaged 4.5 yards a pop so far this year. If Jones is out, I expect to see a lot of downhill runs for Mason, with the Vikings trying to work the play-action passing game off of that. Pick NFL at Underdog Fantasy, where new users who play $5 now get $100 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.When the Chargers have the ballThe Chargers have been one of the pass-heaviest teams in the NFL all season, dropping back on 64.9% of their plays, according to Tru Media. They also have the league's second-highest pass rate over expectation (PROE), according to Establish the Run, and that holds true for both the entire game and in neutral situations. They've been slightly less pass-happy over their last four games as they have dealt with injuries at tackle and running back, but they're still seventh in PROE during that time.\nThe reason this is particularly relevant for this game is that the Vikings have a pretty wide split between their effectiveness against the pass and against the run. According to Tru Media, they rank fifth so far this season in opponents' passing success rate and just 19th in success rate against the run. Opponents have thus been extremely run-heavy against the Vikes, calling a rush on 49.0% of their plays. \nThe Chargers, of course, may decide to go pass-heavy either way. The strength of their team at the moment is Justin Herbert and the pass-catchers. Even nominal starting running back Kimani Vidal, who is filling in for Omarion Hampton, is a better pass-catcher than a runner. He clocked the Dolphins on the ground two weeks ago, but so does everybody. In his career outside of that game, he's averaging around 3.4 yards per carry on his 56 totes. So, don't be surprised if it's a lot of Herbert dropping back and looking for the likes of Ladd McConkey, Quentin Johnston, Keenan Allen and Orande Gadsden II on Thursday night. If and when he does drop back, the Chargers will be faced with a pass rush that blitzes at one of the highest rates in the NFL. The Vikings have sent extra rushers on 41.9% of dropbacks, via Tru Media, which ranks second-highest in the league behind only the Falcons. Minnesota has killed teams when rushing five or more players, ranking third in the league in EPA per dropback. \nWith L.A.'s issues up front (we still don't know whether the starting tackles will actually suit up; they're each listed as questionable), it'll be important for Herbert to get the ball out quickly, which could lead to more work for the underneath targets like McConkey, Allen and Gadsden than for Johnston, who does more of his work down the field. Around 44% of opponent passes against the Vikings have traveled 0 to 5 air yards, according to Tru Media, which is the third-highest rate in football. They've faced bottom-10 rates of throws in the 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and 20-plus air-yard range.The Chargers should definitely at least try to get the run game off the ground, but it could prove difficult with Vidal and practice-squad passing-down back Nyheim Hines in the backfield. (Hassan Haskins is also out -- not that he was particularly effective rushing the ball anyway.) They're not a particularly good run-blocking unit to begin with, and it's not like the Vikings are slouches against the run; they're just not as good against the run as they are against the pass. Instead, this is likely to be a strength-on-strength matchup, with Herbert facing Brian Flores and his creative schemes. That's one of the most potentially exciting matchups you can draw up in the league. \nPrediction\nIn a game where two teams seem likely to have more success running the ball than throwing due to the respective strengths of the opposing defenses, but also probably still want to rely on their passing game to some extent, I'm going to lean toward the team with the quarterback I trust more. That's pretty clearly the Chargers here.Pick: Chargers 24, Vikings 20\n            ",

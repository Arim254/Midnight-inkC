    "body": "\n        The available Week 7 survivor pool teams has dwindled even further. Couple that with a number of upsets, including the Thursday night New York Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, and many survivor pool players' hopes are in tatters. For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football', Broncos (-7) vs. Giants and Mike Vrabel's return to Tennessee in Patriots (-7) vs. Titans.Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

    "body": "\n        Through six weeks of the NFL season, it's hard to find a team who doesn't have a serious question mark. Two weeks ago, we would've been raving about the undefeated Eagles and Bills. Now both teams have lost two straight games. How about Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, one of the preseason favorites? With Jackson having been out each of the last two weeks, Baltimore enters its bye week 1-5 and is in serious danger of missing the postseason. Even the three-time defending AFC champion Chiefs aren't immune. They sit 3-3 heading into a Week 7 home date with AFC rival Las Vegas, though Kansas City is the largest favorite of the week at -11.5.Which teams would you take today to make the Super Bowl?

The Eagles struggled mightily on defense last week, and it's uncertain if defensive lineman Jalen Carter (heel) will be available this week.\"I think it's fair to call this game a must win for Philadelphia coming off two straight losses. We've already seen one Eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit. Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well. This is the type of game where I would bet both sides +7.5 at something like -125 odds and prepare for a close game no matter who wins.

    "body": "\n        Developing a successful NFL DFS strategy can take many forms, but one of the most common approaches is focusing on games with the highest projected point totals when identifying top NFL DFS picks and building NFL DFS stacks.The highest over/under in the Week 7 NFL odds for the Sunday main slate is 54.5 in the Cowboys vs. Commanders matchup. Other potential high-scoring matchups on Sunday include Colts vs. Chargers (over/under of 48.5), Saints vs. Bears (over/under of 46.5), and Raiders vs. Chiefs (over/under of 45.5). Thus, you can expect stars like Dak Prescott, Jayden Daniels, Jonathan Taylor, Ladd McConkey and Travis Kelce to be core players in many NFL DFS lineups. Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cap, forcing you to search for more potential NFL DFS sleepers and NFL DFS values. Should players like Daniel Jones or Justin Herbert find their way into your quarterback slot for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Saquon Barkley and Tua Tagovailoa finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Sunday or locking in NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, where they can pick at Underdog and get $100 in site credits after making a $5 wager:The DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel.

The former first-round pick out of North Carolina had a solid season as a rookie in 2024, as he threw for 2,276 yards with 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, and a passer rating of 88.1. He also added 421 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns on 54 attempts, showcasing his mobility and poise under pressure. In 2025, Maye has taken a big leap forward, throwing for 1,522 yards with 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions while completing over 73% of his throws. His improved accuracy and decision-making have helped the Patriots' offense become more efficient and balanced. Maye has shown impressive command of the playbook and confidence in the pocket, cutting down on turnovers while still attacking downfield. See who else to pick here.The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Cowboys running back Javonte Williams ($6,700 on DraftKings and $7,500 on FanDuel). The former second-round pick out of North Carolina signed with the Cowboys this past offseason after spending the first four years of his career with the Denver Broncos. Williams battled multiple injuries during his career in Denver, but still managed to rush for 2,394 yards and 11 touchdowns and catch 158 passes for 966 yards and five scores in 54 games. Williams has enjoyed a resurgence in Dallas, totaling 92 carries for 476 yards and five touchdowns through six games. He's also contributed 22 receptions for 83 yards and a receiving score, proving to be a reliable dual-threat option. Williams has shown renewed burst and confidence in the Dallas offense, thriving behind a strong offensive line. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to build Sunday Week 7 NFL DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        Miami hasn't played many interesting games this season -- and that's a compliment. There haven't been roller-coaster performances, just competent victories. To date, Miami had shown control and an ability to come out on top in a variety of ways. The Hurricanes could win a slugfest, like they did against Notre Dame; an ugly game, like they did against Florida; or one where they went into a hostile environment and held an overmatched opponent at bay, like they did against Florida State.They seemed built too solidly along both lines of scrimmage -- with too many playmakers, an elite defense and a veteran quarterback -- to fall victim to the ups and downs that plagued them in 2024. But this was a trap game, and the Canes fell right into it. In a 24-21 loss to Louisville, last year's Canes showed up.Carson Beck threw Miami out of this game, to the tune of four interceptions. (He had only three all season entering the night.)\"The first one, the kid made an unbelievable play,\" Beck said of Antonio Watts' diving interception early in the second quarter on a deep shot to his favorite target, Malachi Toney. \n\"The second one, the ball just didn't come out good. He had a beat,\" Beck said of the second interception, a play by Jabari Mack where Mack bites on Beck's pump fake but still recovers to sink under an underthrown ball.\nThe third interception, according to Beck, was just a missed throw. It was actually the second interception he threw on that drive, but a roughing-the-passer penalty wiped away the first. The one that stood ended up in the hands of JoJo Evans -- a crucial turning point in the game, as Louisville had just extended its lead to 11 points.\nBut it was the fourth and final pick that killed Miami's chance at a game-tying field goal to force overtime. The Hurricanes had all three timeouts and felt confident they could move the ball to gain extra yards for their kicker. Louisville walked multiple extra defenders up to the line of scrimmage but ended up bringing five of seven threats. One of the players who dropped out was T.J. Capers, who came down with the second interception of his career.\n\"We have a perfect play for it, we just had a miscommunication with the route and what we were doing,\" Beck said. \"So [Elija Lofton] just ran the route wrong, and I went to go throw it, because we're hot off of the pressure, and again, he made a good play on it, but it definitely didn't help that we ran the wrong play.\"Miami had played only one game since Sept. 20, and the rust showed early. On its opening drive, Louisville -- coming off its own open date -- marched 75 yards in 11 plays, including a fake field goal near the goal line. The Cardinals scored again on their next drive to put Miami in a 14-0 hole, unfamiliar territory for this team. It was the first time all season the Hurricanes had trailed by more than 10 points. They clawed back from the deficit but never led. The closest they came was the three-point final margin, which Louisville gifted them after an Isaiah Brown fumble gave Miami a short field following Beck's third interception.\nLouisville shredded Miami in the middle of the field, with Caulin Lacey and Chris Bell routinely turning drag routes into big gains. Quarterback Miller Moss got the ball out quickly, neutralizing the Canes' vaunted pass rush. Miami's lone sack came on a blitz by a defensive back.\"After those 14 points, I thought we settled down, got our cleats in the ground and started playing good defense, and they're a really good offense, really good play caller, but certainly we gotta be able to move the sticks and put some points on the board to help the defense do well,\" Miami coach Mario Cristobal  said. \"At the end of the game I think we only had 59 plays. A lot of that is due to not sustaining drives. That's not a good play count for our offense.\"The troubling thing about this loss is that the core idea behind this Miami team failed. The theory was that Beck, in a new setting with a stable offensive line in front of him, would be able to do just enough with playmakers C.J. Daniels and Malachi Toney in an Air Raid-style passing game tied to a physical run game. But when the run game faltered and the pressure shifted to the passing attack, the pipe burst.\nThe sloppiness that prevented them from playing for an ACC title or a College Football Playoff berth last year returned in full force -- and with a conference title race expected to feature a logjam of teams at the top, Miami's margin for error is gone.It makes the rest of their season a whole lot more interesting.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        What follows is not hyperbole. It is the truth. Shohei Ohtani just had the best individual playoff game in the history of Major League Baseball. Hopefully you got to witness it -- the Dodgers' pennant-clinching NLCS Game 4 win that completed their sweep of the Brewers -- whether live in person or somewhere on a monitor. If not, just let the stat line soak in. Ohtani came to the plate four times. He made zero outs. He walked once. He hit three mesmerizing home runs. Ohtani also pitched. He threw six scoreless innings and only allowed two hits. He struck out 10. \nDespite having a very quiet first three games of the series, Ohtani was named NLCS MVP after Game 4. Again, let that all soak in.\nWe've known for years that we've never seen anything like Ohtani. I remember in 2023 talking to CC Sabathia and listening to him explain why Ohtani was the greatest player of all-time. I've gone through the old stats before to point out that Babe Ruth's pitching and stellar hitting seasons didn't overlap much. That was three years ago. Ohtani has won two MVPs since then and is going to add another this year. He's won a World Series in 2025 and might very well win another in the next two weeks.This is simply ridiculous.Bill James once wrote that Rickey Henderson was so good that you could cut him in half and have two Hall of Famers. You don't even need to divide Ohtani up. He's clearly a Hall of Fame level offensive player. When he's been able to stay healthy enough to pitch, he pitches at a Hall of Fame level, too. \nIt was all on display in Game 4 of the NLCS. \nJust walk through it chronologically. Ohtani issued a leadoff walk, but then struck out the next three Brewers batters he faced in the top of the first. He led off the bottom of the first with a home run.In the top of the second, he induced two groundouts and a popout from the Brewers' offense.In the bottom of the second, he drew a walk.In the top of the third, he walked a batter, got a strikeout and then a double play. In the top of the fourth, he gave up a leadoff double, but then got a groundout and two strikeouts to strand the runner.In the bottom of the fourth, he homered. It went 469 feet.In the top of the fifth, he got a flyout and two strikeouts on the mound.In the top of the sixth, he got a flyout and two strikeouts. Again. In the bottom of the seventh, he hit another home run.You can't find anyone in postseason history who can compare with that. It's impossible. The following players have three-HR games in their postseason careers: Babe Ruth (twice), Bob Robertson, Reggie Jackson, George Brett, Adam Kennedy, Adrian Beltré, Albert Pujols, Pablo Sandoval, Jose Altuve, Kiké Hernández and Chris Taylor. None of them pitched. No, not even Babe Ruth. None of them.Not only did Ohtani pitch, he dominated the team that had the most wins in the regular season for six scoreless innings in the pennant-clinching victory.\nAnd if you're curious, one pitcher in history has ever had a three-homer game in the regular season. It was Jim Tobin of the 1942 Braves. He went 3 for 4 with three homers and four RBI. He threw a complete game, too. He also allowed five runs (three earned), though. The bar is raised in the playoffs, too, you know? Teams are facing the best teams in the league with higher stakes than the regular season. You see where I'm going, right? Shohei Ohtani just played arguably the greatest baseball game anyone has ever played.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Toronto Blue Jays designated hitter George Springer exited the seventh inning of Friday's ALCS Game 5 loss against the Seattle Mariners after he was struck on the right knee by an errant sinker from right-hander Bryan Woo. Springer suffered what the Blue Jays described as a knee contusion. Manager John Schneider expressed hope that Springer will play in Sunday's Game 6, a must-win contest for Toronto.Here's a look at the pitch in question, which was 95.6 mph:\n\"He's got a right knee contusion. He had X-rays, which were negative, which is a good thing. He'll probably do some more testing tonight when we get home. George is about as tough as they come. I think he'll have to really, really be hurting to not be in the lineup on Sunday, Schneider said after Game 5.  \"So we'll see how he is. On that note, I know this is an awesome atmosphere to play in, and it's really, really cool to play here, and I think the fans that were booing him should take a look in the mirror and understand what kind of player he is and -- I'll stop there, because when a guy gets hit in the knee and is in obvious pain and have you 40,000 people cheering, not the right thing to do.\"\nSpringer initially tried to stay in the game, but after heading to first base he retreated to the dugout, all the while visibly limping. Springer was replaced by fellow outfielder Joey Loperfido, who was only added to the roster on Thursday, replacing injured outfielder Anthony Santander.Springer, 36, had enjoyed a resurgent season this year for the Blue Jays. He batted .309/.399/.560 with 32 home runs and 18 stolen bases. His 161 OPS+ represented a new career best, and his contributions were worth an estimated 4.8 Wins Above Replacement.The Blue Jays held a 2-1 advantage at the time of Springer's departure. He hit a game-tying double in the fifth inning.\nMajor League Baseball's rules surrounding playoff rosters dictate that if a player is removed during the course of a round, he is ineligible for the subsequent round. As such, it's plausible to suggest that the Blue Jays -- if they do advance -- would have to manage without either Springer or Santander.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL trade deadline is fast approaching, and rumors are swirling about various players who could potentially be dealt in the days and weeks to come.One of those players is All-Pro Cincinnati Bengals edge rusher Trey Hendrickson. Hendrickson requested a trade multiple times this offseason amid a contract dispute with the team, but the Bengals ultimately did not honor that request and kept him around.With Cincinnati now 3-4 after a win over the Steelers and potentially back in the mix for a wild card playoff spot, the Bengals might not be inclined to deal Hendrickson. But with the star defensive lineman in the final year of his deal and the team apparently not willing to meet his long-term contract demands, they might also want to get out ahead of things and make sure they don't lose him for nothing in return this coming offseason.With that in mind, we wanted to create a list of potential landing spots for Hendrickson in the event the Bengals do decide to move him ahead of the deadline.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Carolina PanthersFor the second year in a row, the Panthers have a dreadful pass rush. Last season, they generated pressure on just 25.2% of dropbacks, which ranked dead last in the NFL. This year, they've somehow gotten pressure at an even lower rate: 24.3%, which again ranks dead last in the league. They are in desperate need of anybody who can get to the opposing quarterback. Hendrickson does that better than almost anyone else. The Panthers are surprisingly 3-3 and could look to add some talent at the deadline. With their $17 million or so in cap room, they can add the prorated amount remaining on Hendrickson's $16 million base salary.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsWe already know that there's a connection between Hendrickson and the Colts: Indy's defensive coordinator, Lou Anarumo, ran the Bengals' defense when Cincinnati spent big bucks to lure Hendrickson from the Saints; he personally oversaw each of Hendrickson's prolific seasons in the AFC North prior to this one. We also know the Colts could use some help in the pass rush department. They are in the bottom third of the league (tied for 21st) in pressure rate, per TruMedia. Between the need and the personal connection to the coaching staff, it's not hard to connect some dots here if you want to.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit LionsDetroit actually has a league-average pressure rate so far. (Like, exactly league average. The average pressure rate to date is 35.9% and the Lions have pressured quarterbacks on 35.9% of their dropbacks.) But with injuries mounting on the back end of the defense and some holes up front, it might be wise to lean into the pass rush as a foundation. Pairing Hendrickson and Aidan Hutchinson would give Detroit one of the best pass-rush duos in the league, if not the best. And the Lions have plenty of cap room available to make a move like this if they want to go in that direction: Only the Patriots, Cowboys and Commanders are further under the cap than Detroit at around $26.4 million.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore RavensStop me if you've heard this before: the Ravens are not getting very much pressure on opposing quarterbacks. They're actually 28th in the NFL in pressure rate, just ahead of the Bengals. They also just traded away Odafe Oweh, leaving themselves even more shorthanded up front than they were due to the various injuries that have afflicted their defensive line. We know the Ravens love to try to buy in on elite players, especially if they come at a somewhat discounted cost. With Hendrickson in the final year of his deal, it's possible he could be had for a mid-round pick. If that's the case, Baltimore should be interested.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia EaglesSpeaking of teams that like to buy in on star players at potentially discounted prices, we have the Eagles. Philadelphia's pass rush this year has paled in comparison to what it was a year ago. The defense doesn't look the same and that lack of a dominant defensive line is a big part of it. Pairing Hendrickson on the edge with the likes of Jalen Carter on the interior would go a long way toward restoring the Eagles' advantage up front. We know that Howie Roseman is always looking for any and every avenue to improve his team midseason, and that he's not afraid to swing a major deal to upgrade a position of weakness. This could be one of those opportunities.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's only the second year of the 12-team College Football Playoff era, but discussion about the future format of the postseason -- particularly adding more teams to the field -- has been a major storyline in the sportNotre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua is among those who believe expanding the playoff field is the right move, even after the Fighting Irish made the national championship game in the first season with a 12-team field. Speaking Friday on the \"Dan Patrick Show,\" Bevacqua was strong in his endorsement of a 16-team playoff with five automatic qualifiers and 11 at-large entrants rather than various proposals that would guarantee a number of spots for the Big Ten and SEC.\"100% answer in my opinion,\" Bevacqua said of expansion. \"16 teams is the way we should go. Five automatic qualifiers, one each for the Power Four conference champions, one for the highest G5 champion, 11 at large, prove it on the field. If we're lucky enough to be in, we're in. If, because we happen to be independent, we have three losses or four losses and we're out, we're out. I think there's almost unanimity in that feeling. I hope that's where we end up. I feel passionate about that. I think it's the best thing for college football and the best thing for the future of college football.\"\nBevacqua, a member of the CFP Management Committee alongside the 10 FBS conference commissioners, also advocated for a 16-team field over the summer and made it clear at the time that he opposed the idea of four automatic qualifiers for the Big Ten and SEC.\nBevacqua saying there's unanimity in the idea of adding four more teams to the playoff appears to be a change from September, when the CFP management committee only briefly discussed expansion. At the time, CFP executive director Rich Clark said, \"My sense is the room's comfortable with (staying at 12) if that's where we go, and that's probably why they're not too pressed with rushing to a decision.\"CFP leaders must decide on a format for the 2026 playoff by Dec. 1, a deadline set by television partner ESPN.\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff leaders 'comfortable' with 12-team format, not in rush to decide on 2026 expansion\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn Friday, Bevacqua pointed to the makeup of the current AP rankings as proof that the sport has shifted in a more competitive direction and that giving more opportunities to make the playoff would reward teams for good play and a strong schedule, ultimately doing even better to identify a \"true\" national champion.\n\"Look at the top 10 this year, look at the different teams in there,\" Bevacqua said. \"Look at the success Texas Tech is having. You want that. You want every team to wake up at the end of summer and as they go into their first game and say, 'Hey, if we get it done and go 12-0 or go 11-1, if we schedule tough opponents and have a strong strength of schedule, we can earn our way in there.' Nobody wants a head start; that's not the way to do it. We want to prove that we can identify a true national champion and a team that earned it on the field. I feel very strongly about that.\"The 2024 season marked the move from a four-team playoff field. Bevacqua saw Notre Dame suffer an early-season disaster with a home loss to Northern Illinois. But Notre Dame rallied from there and finished the regular season 11-1 before being slotted into the playoff as the No. 7 seed. The Irish battled to the National Championship Game, where they lost to Ohio State. Bevacqua identified the importance of the regular season schedule as even more reason to expand the playoff field, even pointing at Notre Dame's Week 7 game with USC, which will likely eliminate the loser from consideration for this year's playoff.\n\"I think the move from four to 12 was terrific and smart,\" Bevacqua said. \"I think the move from 12 to 16 brings additional teams in, obviously. It creates those four additional narratives around the country. It brings those fanbases in and brings in other geographies. Yet, there's that delicate balance it achieves and maintains of identifying a true national championship, but protecting the integrity and importance of the regular season.\"There's no sport where the regular-season games are more important than they are in college football. Here we are in Week 7 and we have a game tomorrow night that, for us, will determine if we can make the playoffs or if we're on the outside looking in. That doesn't happen in other sports. That's the beauty of college football and why there's so much passion around these games.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A dream season for the Milwaukee Brewers is over. After winning a franchise record 97 games during the regular season, the Brewers were unceremoniously swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS. The Brewers scored four runs in the four games and pitched with a lead for exactly one-third of an inning. Holding the Dodgers to 15 runs in four games was good work, but the offense no-showed, and the Brewers are going home.Milwaukee's 97 wins led baseball and were the fewest by MLB's best team since the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals tied for the league lead with 97 wins in 2013. You have to go back to 2007, when Cleveland and the Red Sox both finished with 96 wins, for the last time the league leader won fewer than 97 games. The Brewers' season can be split into three unequal parts:RecordRun differentialFirst 53 games25-28 (.472)minus-6Next 69 games53-16 (.768)plus-168Final 40 games19-21 (.475)plus-19The Brewers were the first team to win 53 times in a 69-game stretch since the Dodgers from July 5 to Sept. 20, 2022. Milwaukee stumbled a bit down the stretch, though they had baseball's best record and nine-game lead in the NL Central through 122 games, so we have to allow for the possibility (likelihood) that they took their foot off the gas. That certainly appeared to be the case given some of their apparent load management in September.Milwaukee has the fifth-best winning percentage in baseball since 2018, a remarkable accomplishment given the market size, but the Brewers are only 11-20 in the postseason during that time. For all intents and purposes, the Brewers keep falling short in the postseason because they run into teams that operate the same way, only with more money. That's tough to overcome and it is something they will again set out to do in 2026. Here are three pressing questions facing the Brewers this offseason.What happens with Peralta (and Woodruff)?I can tell you this much: Milwaukee will exercise their bargain $8 million club option for 2026. What happens with ace Freddy Peralta after that is a bit more up in the air. The Brewers have a recent history of trading their top players a year before free agency (Corbin Burnes, Josh Hader, Devin Williams, etc.) and Peralta, one of the game's top starters the last five years, is at that point now. He is scheduled to become a free agent for the first time after next season.For what it's worth, Peralta reportedly approached the Brewers about a contract extension at some point, but no deal was struck. Is that because the two sides were apart on dollars/years, or because the team is not interested in locking itself into what figures to be Peralta's decline phase? I suspect it was the former more than the latter. I'm sure the Brewers would love to make Peralta a Brewers for life, but as a small-market team, they have to be smart with their money.Milwaukee's M.O. is to trade its best players a year before free agency for cheap young players who keep the perpetual motion machine moving, and there is no reason to think Peralta will be an exception. That $8 million salary is so cheap. He's worth three times that on the open market. The one-year term figures to limit Peralta's trade market to contenders only, but there will be no shortage of interested teams if the Brewers do indeed make him available.There is also the case of Brandon Woodruff. Milwaukee's longest-tenured player returned from shoulder surgery this season and made 12 starts with a 3.20 ERA before a lat strain ended his season in September. His contract includes a $20 million mutual option with a $10 million buyout. Mutual options are usually pointless. They're a way to move money to next year's payroll (via a buyout) more than they are a way for the team and player to stay together for another year.With Woodruff, I do wonder if this is one of the ultra-rare cases where both sides will pick up their end of the mutual option. The buyout makes it a $10 million decision for Woodruff. Can he get that as a free agent? Yeah, maybe, though he would open himself up to a pre-signing physical a year after major shoulder surgery and a few weeks after a lat strain. There's risk there. The Brewers have to pay Woodruff $10 million no matter what. Keeping him for another $10 million is a good outcome for them.The Brewers used an opener four times in nine postseason games, which is not automatically a bad thing -- Milwaukee's offense let them down in the NLCS, not pitching -- though it does speak to a lack of innings and a lack of trustworthy three-times-through-the-lineup starters. This is the team's 2026 rotation depth chart without Peralta and Woodruff:RHP Jacob MisiorowskiRHP Quinn PriesterRHP Chad PatrickLHP Robert GasserRHP Tobias MyersRHP Logan Henderson (elbow inflammation ended his season in August)RHP Carlos RodriguezRHP Coleman Crow (flexor strain ended his season in July)Lefty DL Hall never threw more than 3 ⅔ innings or 56 pitches in a game this season. He's had several injuries the last two years (lat, knee, oblique) and it seems like his days as a starter may be over. If they're not, great. We could slot Hall into that depth chart somewhere in that case. Otherwise that's solid rotation depth with upside (Misiorowski in particular), though it is a collection of guys more than capital-G Guys. Guys who can get you through 162 games worth of innings more than guys who start in October.As good as they were this season, the Brewers still needed 24 starts from Jose Quintana plus a handful more from Tyler Alexander, Aaron Civale, Nestor Cortes, Elvin Rodriguez, and others. A Peralta trade is a distinct possibility, and it will remove the team's best starter and most reliable source of innings. Even if the Brewers do bring Woodruff back, there's room to add to the rotation. At least a Quintana type who soaks up innings and helps get them to the finish line of the regular season.How do they add more power to the lineup?Collectively, we make too much of the postseason, and I'm including myself in that \"we.\" We read too much into 3-7 game series. The postseason is good team vs. good team, so a good team has to lose, and when they do lose, it can often be ugly, as the NLCS was for the Brewers. Sometimes you just get beat though. Not every postseason defeat happens because a team's weakness gets exploited or because they lacked some intangible quality. Sometimes you just lose.\nIn Milwaukee's case, it was hard not to notice that the team that hit only 166 home runs during the regular season, ninth fewest in baseball and second fewest by a postseason team (the San Diego Padres hit 152), had a hard time scoring runs in the NLCS. Part of that is the Dodgers' pitching, absolutely, but is it really a surprise that a Brewers team that ranked among the league's worst in various batted ball metrics had a hard time against top tier pitching? BrewersMLB rankMLB averageAverage exit velocity88.6 mph28th89.4 mphBarrel rate (what's this?)6.7%29th8.6%Hard-hit rate39.2%25th40.9%The Brewers scored 806 runs this year, third most in baseball behind the New York Yankees (849) and Dodgers (825). The low-power offense worked for them, largely because they were baseball's best team with runners in scoring position. Power and home runs are an important piece of the pie though. It's hard to beat an ace-caliber pitcher or a lockdown bullpen by stringing together hits and walks. Look at the league-wide numbers since the 12-team postseason field was implemented in 2022:Runs per gameHome runs per gameRegular season4.451.16Postseason4.051.21Run scoring goes down and home runs go up in the postseason. The Dodgers hit the second most home runs during the regular season and they're in the World Series, where they'll play either the Seattle Mariners (third most homers) or the Toronto Blue Jays (11th most). The 2024 World Series featured two of the top three teams in homers. The No. 3 team in homers won the 2023 World Series. The 2022 World Series was two of the top six teams in homers. On and one we could go.\nI understand the Brewers have a style of play that works (very) well for them, but I don't think it's outlandish to say they would benefit from more power. Adding it is doable. It will just take some creativity because they have payroll limitations that will prevent them from winning a free-agent bidding war for, say, Kyle Schwarber. A full year of Andrew Vaughn, William Contreras having a healthy finger, and Jackson Chourio leveling up will help. There's room to add more thump around them though.Milwaukee's top eight and 12 of their top 13 players in plate appearances this season are under contract or team control in 2026. They can return largely the same offense next season and that's not a bad thing given this year's success. It just means that, if they do make an effort to add power, it will require some difficult decisions. Someone will have to get traded to make room, lose at-bats, etc. The lack of power is not a fatal flaw even though it looked like one in the NLCS, but it is a flaw that can be addressed.How do they get over the hump?In a way, the Brewers did get over the hump this year. Their NLDS win over the rival Chicago Cubs was their first postseason series win since 2018. Five postseason trips in six years from 2019-24 brought five quick exits. That's not the hump I'm talking about here though. Win as much as the Brewers have the last few years, and you should start focusing on the World Series, especially when you've never won one. Successful regular seasons count for only so much, and they can get stale after a while when they come with swift postseason defeats year after year.\nThe answer to the \"how do they get over the hump\" question could be as simple as sticking with what works, and hoping things break your way one of these years. It's an unsatisfying answer but it might be the correct answer. Clearly, the Brewers are doing a lot right. They contend every season despite running very small payrolls, and that's not easy to do. There's room to add some power here, and maybe more impact pitching, though that applies to almost every team. The Brewers are maybe 95% of the way to a World Series title. That last 5% is the hardest to figure out, and sometimes it's not even in your control.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bradley Chubb has been one of the few bright spots for the Miami Dolphins during the 2025 NFL season. At 1-5, the AFC East club probably doesn't stand much of a chance of resurging for a playoff run. But the defense has gotten some vintage performances from Chubb one year after the longtime pass rusher missed a full season due to injury; he leads the unit with four sacks in six games.Now it might be time for Chubb to take his quarterback-chasing talents elsewhere. Why, you say? Wouldn't the Dolphins be especially motivated to keep him in town, given their widespread struggles on both sides of the ball? Isn't he one of the few reliable talents still left on a franchise that's already facing big-picture questions? The trouble is, he might be more valuable to Miami as a trade chip than a long-term building block, considering he's approaching 30 with a contract set to pay him more than $30 million in 2026.Where, exactly, might Chubb be headed if the Dolphins look to sell him ahead of the in-season deadline on Tuesday, Nov. 4? Here are some potential landing spots:\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jacksonville JaguarsThe Jaguars are already paying top dollar to Josh Hines-Allen off the edge, and their defense ranks in the top 10 in terms of points allowed per game. Jacksonville ranks in the bottom five in sacks, however, logging just eight quarterback takedowns in the first six games. Chubb might like to stay in-state with a Florida relocation, and this swap might mean an actual chance at a division title and playoff run. New Jags general manager James Gladstone has shown an interest in splashy gambles (see: Travis Hunter deal), so this kind of upgrade could be par for the course.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Philadelphia EaglesVic Fangio maximized the talent at his disposal in the Eagles' 2024 Super Bowl run. His current pass rushing outfit leaves a lot to be desired, however, with Nolan Smith Jr. banged up and veteran bargains like Azeez Ojulari and Joshua Uche hurting for sacks. Chubb isn't a spring chicken, so general manager Howie Roseman might be unwilling to part with a premium pick for such a short-term gamble. Still, Chubb is a Pro Bowl-caliber talent who also has experience playing under Fangio from their time with the Denver Broncos. Adding him might provide just the kind of spark the Birds need.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersThe 49ers have gotten occasionally decent push from Bryce Huff off the edge, but Robert Saleh's unit is otherwise in danger of depletion: With both Nick Bosa and Fred Warner lost for the year due to injury, San Francisco could sorely use some front-seven reinforcements. Chubb has been more of a standard 3-4 outside linebacker for much of his career, but pocket disruption is pocket disruption, and his veteran force could help preserve the 49ers' physicality in the trenches for the stretch run. They might really need the \"D\" if the offense can't stay healthy, too.\n            ",

Meanwhile, Jakobi Meyers made his return to practice on Friday as a limited participant and is officially questionable. \nKansas City is remarkably healthy heading into Week 7 but will again be without left tackle Josh Simmons.

He was again limited Friday and is officially questionable.

Carter was a limited participant on Thursday and Friday due to a heel injury and is officially questionable. Head coach Kevin O'Connell announced Friday that Carson Wentz will start for the Vikings in Week 7 against Philadelphia. Max Brosmer will serve as the backup to Wentz, while McCarthy, who is still recovering from an ankle injury, will be the emergency quarterback. Miami Dolphins at Cleveland Browns (-2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+  TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusDolphinsElijah CampbellDBQuadOutTyrel DodsonLBConcussionQuestionableStorm DuckCBAnkleQuestionableBrownsDavid NjokuTEKneeOutJack ConklinOTConcussionQuestionableMason GrahamDTKneeQuestionableMike HallDTKneeQuestionableGage LarvadainWRConcussionQuestionableJoe Tryon-ShoyinkaDEHipQuestionableCampbell was unable to practice with the Dolphins at all this week and has since been ruled out. Meanwhile, despite questionable statuses, both Dodson and Duck practiced fully this week. \nThe Browns will be without Njoku after he did not practice this week due to a knee injury. On the defensive side of the ball, the most intriguing development revolves around first-round rookie Mason Graham, who popped up on the injury report Friday as a DNP due to a knee injury.

Given the success of Rico Dowdle in his absence, it will be curious to see how the backfield carries are split up. None of the players the Jets listed as doubtful, including Wilson, practiced this week. CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported Friday that Wilson will not play vs. Carolina. As for Carter and Weston, both practiced fully throughout the week. \nNew England Patriots (-7) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET on CBS | Stream on Paramount+ TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPatriotsJaylinn HawkinsSHamstringQuestionableHarold Landry IIILBAnkleQuestionableStefon DiggsWRChestQuestionableCharles WoodsCBKneeQuestionableTitansBlake HanceOLShoulderOutArden KeyOLBQuadOutBryce OliverWRKneeOutCalvin RidleyWRHamstringOutMarcus HarrisCBCalfQuestionableDre'Mont JonesOLBKneeQuestionableT'Vondre SweatNTAnkleQuestionableNew England is relatively healthy coming into Week 7.

On a more encouraging note in the secondary, head coach Shane Steichen said that Kenny Moore II is \"ready to go\" after missing Weeks 4, 5 and 6. Khalil Mack headlines the group of six players listed as questionable for the Chargers. The veteran pass rusher had his practice window opened on Wednesday and was limited throughout the week. Meanwhile, Alt did log back-to-back limited practices on Thursday and Friday, but is doubtful to play in Week 7. Green Bay Packers (-6.5) at Arizona CardinalsSunday, 4:25 p.m. on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPackersDevonte WyattDLKneeOutChristian WatsonWRKneeOutLukas Van NessDLFootOutDontayvion WicksWRAnkleQuestionableZach TomOLOblique, backQuestionableJacob MonkIOLHamstringQuestionableBrandon McManusKRight quadQuestionableJosh JacobsRBIllness, calfQuestionableNate HobbsCBKneeQuestionableAnthony BeltonOTAnkleQuestionableCardinalsWalter NolenDLCalfOutEmari DemercadoRBAnkleOutKitan CrawfordSAnkleQuestionableWill HernandezOLKneeQuestionableZay JonesWRKneeQuestionableKyler MurrayQBFootQuestionableDarius RobinsonDLPectoralQuestionableGreen Bay has seven players listed as questionable for Week 7, including running back Josh Jacobs. He was limited on Wednesday and Thursday due to an illness and calf injury, but did bump up to a full participant on Friday, which is a good sign. Arizona did not give Marvin Harrison Jr. a designation for Week 7 after he logged a full practice on Friday after clearing concussion protocol. While Harrison will play, it still remains to be seen about Kyler Murray. The quarterback practiced on a limited basis throughout the week and is officially questionable. If he's unable to go, it'll be Jacoby Brissett again that gets the nod. Washington Commanders at Dallas Cowboys (-1)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. on Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) TeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusCommandersTerry McLaurinWRQuadOutDorance ArmstrongDEHamstringQuestionableSamuel CosmiGKneeQuestionableZach ErtzTEShoulder, calfQuestionableJonathan JonesCBHamstringQuestionableDeebo Samuel Jr.WRHeelQuestionableCowboysTrevon DiggsCBKnee, concussionOutTrevor KeeganGNeckOutCaelen CarsonCBKneeQuestionableAjani CorneliusOTKneeQuestionableMarshawn KneelandDEAnkleQuestionableJonathan MingoWRKneeQuestionableMazi SmithDTAnkleQuestionableJuanyeh ThomasSMigraineQuestionableMcLaurin will be sidelined for his fourth consecutive game as he deals with a quad injury.

Sticking at receiver, Deebo Samuel said, We'll just have to see\" when asked following Friday's practice if he'll play Sunday. The Cowboys will see the return of CeeDee Lamb in Week 7 as the wideout carries no designation for Sunday.

Meanwhile, head coach Raheem Morris said he sent McCloud home with an \"excused absence,\" as the team is \"working through some things that are private with the young man.\" The Niners will once again be without Brock Purdy as the franchise quarterback has been ruled out with his toe injury. That means Mac Jones will get another start for the organization, despite dealing with knee and oblique injuries of his. own. On a more positive note, George Kittle will make his return in Week 7 and head coach Kyle Shanahan relayed that the tight end will not be on a pitch count of any sorts. Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Detroit Lions (-5.5) (Monday)Monday, 7 p.m. ET on ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Buccaneers: TBALions: TBAAnalysis to come. Houston Texans at Seattle Seahawks (-3) (Monday)Monday, 10 p.m. ET on ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Texans: TBASeahawks: TBAAnalysis to come. \n            ",

Mullen, a former SEC coach himself at Mississippi State and Florida, said he had 0.0% interest in succeeding Sam Pittman, and instead urged the school to hire current Florida State offensive coordinator and former Auburn coach Gus Malzahn instead.\"0.0 interest in Arkansas,\" Mullen wrote on X on Friday. \"Thanks for the shout out though. Y'all need to hire Gus Malzahn.\"Mullen has UNLV off to a 6-0 start (2-0 in Mountain West) in his first season at the helm of the program. Mullen spent 13 seasons as a head coach in the SEC, which included guiding Mississippi State to eight consecutive bowl games. Mullen had served as an on-air analyst for ESPN since 2022.\n        \n            \n                Arkansas coaching candidates: Rhett Lashlee, Bobby Petrino among options on hot board to replace Sam Pittman\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEarlier in the week, Mullen addressed being linked to potential open jobs and reaffirmed his commitment to staying at UNLV.\n\"I'll be here,\" Mullen said. \"I'm going to be the head coach at UNLV next year. I'll be here. I'm not going anywhere.\" Arkansas fired Pittman last month after a 56-13 loss to Notre Dame, which dropped the Razorbacks to 2-3 at the time. Pittman finished with a 32-34 overall record at the school, which included going 14-29 against SEC opponents during his five-plus seasons as the coach.\nIf Arkansas did give Malzahn a look -- per Mullen's recommendation -- the school would get a coach with experience coaching in the SEC. The former Auburn coach left his post at UCF last fall to become the offensive coordinator at FSU under Mike Norvell. Malzahn helped orchestrate a 31-17 upset win over Alabama in Week 1, but FSU is just 2-3 since that dramatic victory.\n            \n    ",

Dallas (6-5-1) defeated Kansas City on Thanksgiving, 31-28, for its third straight victory. Detroit (7-5) fell to Green Bay on the holiday, 31-24, as the Lions have alternated wins and losses over their last eight games. However, the Lions won the last meeting between the teams, 47-9 in 2024, which is Dallas' largest margin of defeat since 1988.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Ford Field in Detroit. The Lions' victory in their 2024 matchup ended a six-game win streak by Dallas in the head-to-head series. Detroit is a 3-point favorite in the latest Lions vs. Cowboys odds, as the line has held steady since first opening. Meanwhile, the over/under for total points is 54.5. Before making any Cowboys vs. Lions picks, make sure to check out the 'Thursday Night Football' predictions from SportsLine NFL expert R.J.

Meanwhile, Detroit has lost three straight versus the spread, and it has lost some of its best playmakers. Sam LaPorta (back) could be out for the season, while Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) is in danger of missing this game after not practicing all week. While Detroit still has its backfield of Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery to lean on, the run defense has been the biggest improvement for Dallas recently. Since acquiring Quinnen Williams from the Jets, Dallas has allowed just 69.7 rushing yards, which is less than half of the 143 yards per game it allowed in nine games prior to his arrival. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Lions can coverThese teams met in October 2024 -- in Dallas -- in which the Lions' 38-point victory was their third-largest road win, ever, while the game also marked Dallas' fourth-largest home loss in franchise history. So, Detroit should feel very confident it can take care of business at home, as the Cowboys average 6.9 fewer points on the road than in Dallas. Dan Campbell also knows how to get the best out of his team after a defeat, as the Lions have remarkable resiliency in terms of spread success. Since the start of the 2023 season, the Lions are 10-1 ATS (90.9%) following a straight-up defeat, while Dallas is just 11-13 ATS (45.8%) after a win over that same time frame. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest BetMGM bonus code to get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:How to make Cowboys vs. Lions  picksWhite has analyzed Lions vs. Cowboys from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

The Nets have won back-to-back games for the first time all season, defeating the Hornets, 116-103, on Monday before knocking off the Bulls, 113-103, last night. Brooklyn is 5-16 on the year, but the Nets have received steady contributions from players such as Michael Porter Jr. and Nic Claxton. Porter is averaging 25.3 points per game in his first season in Brooklyn, including 34 points over his last two games. Claxton had 14 points, eight rebounds and nine assists against the Bulls. The Jazz are 7-13 and have lost their last four road games. The model projects the Nets to cover in 68% of simulations. Back the Nets at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Cowboys (+3) vs. Lions (-108)The Cowboys have won three straight games, knocking off the Eagles and Chiefs over the last two weeks, and any time you defeat both Super Bowl teams from the previous season over a short stretch, your team is clearly doing something right. For Dallas, they are doing things right on both sides of the ball, which has been a rarity this season. Dallas had one of the worst defenses in the NFL before the trade deadline, but adding defensive lineman Quinnen Williams from the Jets and linebacker Logan Wilson from the Bengals has changed that. The Cowboys are allowing 21.7 ppg over their last three games, compared to 30.8 ppg over their first nine contests. Offense has never been the issue, with Dallas ranking second in the league at 29.3 ppg, and with the Lions' offense battling some key injuries, the model projects Dallas to cover the spread in 50% of simulations. Given the possibility of a push with a 3-point Lions victory, the model sees Dallas +3 as the strongest option for Thursday Night Football. Back the Cowboys at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:UC Davis (+9.5) vs. Hawaii (-115)\"I have these teams rated closer than the large spread indicates,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"Both teams have played well the two times they stepped up in class. Hawaii has close losses to Arizona State and Oregon, while UC Davis upset Nevada and played tough at Colorado. I think the Rainbow Warriors' metrics are a bit overrated right now, thanks to a soft schedule. Another factor could be turnovers. Hawaii's biggest weakness is turnovers, and UC Davis pressures the ball at an above-average rate. Ten of the last 13 games between these two have been decided by eight points or less.\" Back UC Davis at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Thursday Night Football, NBA, college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The manager of the two-time defending World Series champions and the most expensive team in baseball history is in favor of limiting player salaries. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said he would support a salary cap, with the caveat that it comes with a salary floor.  \"You know what? I'm all right with (a salary cap),\" Roberts said during an appearance on Amazon Prime's \"Good Sports.\" \"I think the  NBA has done a nice job of revenue sharing with the players and the  owners. But if you're going to kind of suppress spending at the top, I  think that you got to raise the floor to make those bottom-feeders spend  money too.\"As our R.J. Anderson explained, MLB's owners have pushed for a salary cap since the 19th century, and they will do so again when the collective bargaining agreement expires next Dec. 1. The league regularly cites competitive balance -- the Dodgers were MLB's first back-to-back champs in a quarter-century -- and unverifiable claims of financial hardship as the reason behind their efforts.\nA salary floor is a necessary part of the conversation, not a concession. The MLB Players Association has resisted a salary cap to date and the smart money is on them doing so again next year, but any discussion of a salary cap that does not include a salary floor is a non-starter. From there, MLB and the MLBPA have to agree to what constitutes revenue, which would be another major battle.The Dodgers had a $415 million payroll for competitive balance tax purposes in 2025, per Cot's Baseball Contracts, which is a $62 million increase from their 2024 payroll and $40 million clear of the previous record (the 2023 New York Mets). That $415 million payroll will come with a $167 million or so competitive balance tax bill, so, all-in, it was a $582 million team.\nRoberts, who is baseball's highest paid manager at $8.1 million per season, poked fun at those who criticized the Dodgers for their spending after the club swept the small-market Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, saying, \"Before the season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball. Let's get four more wins and really ruin baseball!\"\n            \n    ",

The  latest   news, a      historical      question,         thoughts     about         the future  of         baseball,   all   sorts of   stuff. Two weeks ago we discussed a potential Nolan Arenado trade. This week we're going to tackle next week's Winter Meetings.Who will be the best player traded at the Winter Meetings?Dayn Perry: I think it's unlikely that Tarik Skubal is traded this  offseason and thus even less likely he'll be dealt during the Winter  Meetings. So I'll have to go lower on the list. I'll land on Brendan  Donovan from the Cardinals to the Yankees in exchange for a package led  by young pitchers. Bigger names will be dealt in the weeks and months  ahead, but Donovan's a notable sort. He's a quality bat from the left  side who has the ability to play multiple positions and be a defensive  plus at the key position of second base. He'll be a nice fit in the  Bronx. R.J. Anderson: Donovan is a good guess. I'll stick in the NL Central and  say Freddy Peralta. There've already been public murmurs about  Milwaukee's payroll following Brandon Woodruff's return. The Brewers  have shown a real skill for turning one year of a quality pitcher into  capable returns -- be it Corbin Burnes a couple of years ago or Devin  Williams this past winter. I think contenders are going to look at the  free-agent market and decide they'd rather meet Milwaukee's ask on  Peralta than pony up for a lesser pitcher.\n        \n            \n                MLB Winter Meetings bold predictions: Mets bring home their guy(s), Yankees add a surprise starter, more moves\n                \n                    Mike Axisa                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMatt Snyder: I'm gonna agree with R.J. and go with Peralta. In addition  to only having one year of team control left before free agency -- with  the Burnes and Williams examples from the recent past -- I think Peralta  just had his career year. He'll be 30 next season and posted several  career highs. His ERA+ from the previous three seasons was 113, 112 and  113, respectively, before jumping to 154 last season. Some of the  \"expected\" stats say he's due regression, perhaps significantly so, in  2026. The Brewers have a very astute front office and know all this  stuff and more. If they're getting blown away with offers, they'll  strike. \nMike Axisa: I'll go off the board a bit and say Royce Lewis. Lewis had a pretty rough 2025, so maybe it's incorrect to say he'll be the \"best player\" traded at the Winter Meetings, but he's not short on talent and we've seen him be very good at times. The Twins sold hard at the trade deadline and ownership seems determined to shed payroll. Lewis is projected for a modest $3 million through arbitration next year and he's only 26 with another three years of control, so keeping him is more than sensible. I can see a path to the Twins trading him though. They're selling and a team could swoop in with a good offer. Lewis is my off-the-board answer.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Siena lacrosse coach Liam Gleason has died after suffering a traumatic injury in a fall at his home on Sunday, the school announced on Wednesday. He was 41 years old. Gleason led Siena's lacrosse program for seven years. Last season, he led the Saints to Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference championship and a berth in the NCAA Tournament. He received MAAC and Eastern College Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honors after securing the program's first national ranking in 14 years. \"The Siena community is devastated by this unspeakable tragedy,\" Siena vice president and director of athletics John D'Argenio said. \"As one Siena family, we give our support, prayers, and love to Jaclyn, Kennedy, Penn, Tate, and the entire Gleason family, as well as our men's lacrosse student athletes and alumni, and those whom Liam touched while both a coach and player at University of Albany. Liam was an amazing human being, a great teammate in the department, and made Siena a better place.\"An accomplished player at Albany, Gleason spent seven seasons as the associated head coach at his alma mater while helping guide the Great Danes to six consecutive NCAA tournament appearances. Gleason's first coaching opportunity was at Siena, where he served as the team's defensive coordinator from 2008-10. During that time, the Saints enjoyed one of their best three-year runs in program history that included its first MAAC Tournament Championship and NCAA Tournament appearance in 2009. The Saints also won MAAC regular season titles in both 2009 and 2010.\nBeyond wins and losses, Gleason left a profound impact on and the athletes he coached. On Wednesday afternoon, dozens of people -- including Siena players, school officials and members of the University at Albany athletic community -- lined a hospital hallway on Wednesday afternoon to pay tribute to Gleason as he was being wheeled into surgery to donate some of his organs, Siena officials said told the AP. The school announced his death several hours later.Gleason, who leaves behind his wife of 12 years and three children. At the request of the family, donations in his memory can be made to the Siena Men's Lacrosse Coaches Discretionary Fund. \nA public funeral service will be held on campus Saturday morning. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With just five weeks left in the regular season, the field seems as wide-open as it has ever been. At least in recent years, I cannot remember a season that felt like this one does, where nobody knows who the favorite is or should be this late into the year.That's especially the case in the AFC, where there are two teams whose records stand out above the rest but who do not necessarily fit the traditional look of heavy favorites. Behind those teams (the Patriots and Broncos) is a group of eight squads that are fighting for five playoff spots -- two division titles and three wild cards. Each of the Bills, Ravens, Steelers, Jaguars, Colts, Texans, Chargers and Chiefs has a record between 6-6 and 8-4, and they all have a chance to make it to the postseason, either by winning their division (the AFC North and South teams) or by landing one of the wild-card spots. So in the space below, we're going to rank these eight teams by how much trust we have in them at the moment. That doesn't necessarily mean we're ranking their actual likelihood to make the playoffs, to be clear -- just how much we trust them to get a win in any given week, which will obviously help them along the way.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Houston TexansThe Texans are here mostly because they have the single-best unit out of every team in contention for an AFC wild card spot. Their defense is not just the best among this group of teams, but arguably the best in the NFL. With Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter pressuring quarterbacks and a smothering secondary, they can shut down just about any team in the league. Their offense is also improving in recent weeks. If they can be elite on defense and above-average on offense, that might be enough to contend in the AFC, given how wide-open the conference seems to be at the moment. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Buffalo Bills The Bills have shown this year that they can reach a high ceiling, but also that they have a decently high floor. They have several different ways they can win games because of their power rushing attack (led by an offensive line that has looked very, very good except when playing against the Texans defense) and the presence of Josh Allen, who obviously can win a whole lot of games by himself. The defense is good but not great, mostly because pretty much anyone can run the ball on the Bills pretty much at will. So, there are flaws here. But they can be overcome by the extreme strengths in the right circumstances.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Kansas City Chiefs Yes, we are still going with the Chiefs here. And, cards on the table, we originally had them at No. 2 before remembering that the Bills are really good at running the ball and the Chiefs are, well, not. The Chiefs have better underlying numbers pretty much across the board than they did last season. They just cannot seem to win the close games this year that they have consistently won otherwise during the Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid era. Even when it looks like the offense is operating in a small box, they still find a way to be efficient and put points on the board, and the defense is basically a league-average unit. This is a good team that's gotten some bad luck.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Los Angeles Chargers It might seem strange to have the Chargers next given all of their injuries to the offensive line, and now to quarterback Justin Herbert. But even after left-hand surgery Herbert should be back in short order, and this ranking is more about a level of confidence in their defense than it is about their offense. Jesse Minter's group is one of the more smothering units in the NFL, particularly against the pass, and that's a good basis around which to build a potential contender. You can run the ball a bit on the Chargers, but if you can't throw it at all, that's not much comfort. If Omarion Hampton comes back healthy, the offense should get a boost, too. \n        \n            \n                Ranking seven NFL Week 14 games with huge playoff implications: Lions-Cowboys, Chiefs-Texans loom large\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Baltimore Ravens It's really hard to put much faith in the Ravens right now given the way they have looked even while going 5-1 in their last six games. The defense has gotten better as it's gotten healthier, but the offense has been a slog even with Lamar Jackson back in the lineup -- mostly because Jackson does not look healthy, and that has knock-on effects for the entire rest of the operation. But at any time, we could get LAMAR JACKSON back and the entire thing could be flipped on its head. The Ravens have among the easier tracks to actually get to the playoffs among this group of teams because all they have to do is beat out the Steelers, and then they get to play at least one home game. But you're still just betting on the hope that the QB gets healthy.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Jacksonville Jaguars Yeah, I do not trust the Jaguars at all. Sue me. They've won four of their last five, including one against the Chargers in blowout fashion; but their other three wins came against the Raiders, the Cardinals in overtime and the Titans. I'm not exactly impressed just yet. Trevor Lawrence is probably playing better than he was earlier in the year but will also still throw the occasional mind-boggling pick. The run game has been very inconsistent despite Travis Etienne's fantasy scores. And the defense can stop the run but doesn't rush the passer as well as it should given the dual presences of Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker. There's just something about this team that leaves me cold.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Indianapolis Colts All that said, I am more confident in the Jags right now than I am in the Colts, whose quarterback is playing on a fractured leg and looks like he can't really move, and who just lost Sauce Gardner for several weeks due to injury. They've now lost three of four and have scored 20 points or fewer in all three of those losses after scoring 29 or more in seven of their first eight games. The Colts were already treading a very narrow path given that they were relying on Daniel Jones not turning into a pumpkin, and that path has gotten even narrower due to these injuries. Jonathan Taylor can carry a team in any given week, but it's a lot to ask to do it over the final five weeks of the season and into the playoffs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL playoff picture is finally taking shape. Or is it? As CBS Sports Research notes, we might be in the midst of the most unpredictable Super Bowl race ever, with five different first-place teams holding less than a one-game division lead going into Week 14, plus 10 different teams with championship odds of 20-1 or shorter. In other words, \"any given Sunday\" truly applies this year.  Which means there's plenty of hope even for those on the outside of the current playoff picture. No stunning defeat is too damaging, it seems, in such a wide-open competition for postseason berths. Just ask the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, who can't stop trading the top spot in the AFC North, where even the Cincinnati Bengals are clinging to improbable playoff chances.  Why, exactly, can fans of uneven clubs believe in their respective teams? Here's one reason for hope for seven notable teams currently lurking outside the projected playoff field:  Note: Projected playoff chances courtesy of SportsLine simulations.  \n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: Here are the 14 teams projected to make the postseason with Packers taking NFC North\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n  AFC teams on the bubble  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tHouston Texans (7-5)  Playoff chances: 58.7%  DeMeco Ryans' defense is championship-caliber. The Texans may not have a chart-topping offense as C.J. Stroud settles back in under center, but one year after the Philadelphia Eagles dominated the Super Bowl with a stingy defense, it's not a stretch to suggest Houston's unit can rival such production. Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. are a freakish edge rushing duo, and there isn't a single defense surrendering fewer points or yards per game entering the home stretch.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tKansas City Chiefs (6-6)  Playoff chances: 37.6%  The remaining schedule is relatively light. It's odd to have a dynasty listed as a long shot to make it to the dance, but the Chiefs have relied far too much on last-minute heroics. Still, with Patrick Mahomes doing more through the air as of late, a strong finish is conceivable. The Chiefs' next two opponents (Texans, Chargers) have proven vulnerable with injury-riddled offenses, and two of their last three are against lowly squads in the Las Vegas Raiders and Tennessee Titans.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tMiami Dolphins (5-7)  Playoff chances: <1%  The defense is turning a corner. Mike McDaniel might not be able to squeeze Pro Bowl production out of Tua Tagovailoa anymore, but Miami has avoided the catastrophic collapse for which it seemed destined by tightening the screws on \"D.\" Seasoned veterans like Bradley Chubb, Jordyn Brooks and Minkah Fitzpatrick have all stepped up to limit opponents, including heavyweights like the Bills, to an average of just 14.3 points per game over the last three weeks.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6)  Playoff chances: 45.1%  The Ravens refuse to secure the North. In truth, there's not a lot to like about Pittsburgh right now. Aaron Rodgers fully looks his age (41) as he battles a wrist injury and, apparently, unreliable support from his middling pass catchers. Mike Tomlin's big-name defense has way more bark than bite. And yet Baltimore, the current frontrunner in the division, is maybe just as volatile at 6-6 with a negative point differential. Tomlin also has a solid track record against the Ravens.  \n  NFC teams on the bubble  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tCarolina Panthers (7-6)  Playoff chances: 15.6%  Bryce Young won't quit. All year, the former No. 1 overall pick has offered plenty of evidence to suggest he's simply not built to weather the pace and size of the NFL. He's also sandwiched four different fourth-quarter comebacks and five game-winning drives between the ineptitude. Typically that boom-or-bust operation wouldn't be enough to forecast a playoff push, but Carolina also boasts a top-10 rushing attack thanks to the emergence of a new bruiser in Rico Dowdle.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tDallas Cowboys (6-5-1)  Playoff chances: 24.5%  Dak Prescott is on an MVP-level tear. There have been a few duds from the Cowboys' longtime quarterback this year, but it's saying something that he's mostly overshadowed the drama of Jerry Jones' defensive makeover. Even with CeeDee Lamb producing untimely drops, Prescott has zipped it all over the yard, displaying all-star downfield chemistry with George Pickens. He's easily been the most prolific passer of the NFC East, which could haunt the slumping Eagles.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tDetroit Lions (7-5)  Playoff chances: 37.8%  They can still move the ball with the best of them. It's not that Detroit isn't racking up the yards and points; the Lions rank third in both categories, ahead of title favorites and potential No. 1 seeds like the Green Bay Packers, Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots. The fundamentals and trenches just haven't been nearly as solid, leading to iffier results on coach Dan Campbell's notorious fourth-down efforts. We're not counting out home run hitters like Jahmyr Gibbs, and we've seen Campbell turn adversity into improved focus before.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Detroit Lions won five of their first seven games of the 2025 NFL season and appeared to be on their way to at least a third consecutive playoff appearance, and possibly a third straight NFC North title. Meanwhile, the Dallas Cowboys recorded only three victories over their first nine contests and seemed destined to miss the postseason for the second year in a row.Detroit (7-5) has had its issues since returning from its Week 8 bye and finds itself on the outside looking in, while Dallas (6-5-1) has reeled off three consecutive wins following its bye in Week 10 and suddenly is back in the NFC playoff picture. The Lions and Cowboys will be looking to remain in the hunt when they kick off Week 14 at Ford Field on Thursday Night Football at 8:15 p.m. ET.The Lions find themselves in third place in the NFC North and eighth in the conference after dropping a 31-24 decision to the Green Bay Packers last week. Detroit is 1 1/2 games behind Green Bay and trails the first-place Chicago Bears by two with five contests remaining on the schedule.Thanks to their current surge and back-to-back losses by Philadelphia, the Cowboys are within 1 1/2 games of the NFC East-leading Eagles. Dallas trounced the Las Vegas Raiders 33-16 in its return from its bye and posted an astounding 24-21 comeback victory against Philadelphia in Week 12 after falling behind by 21 points. The Cowboys then upset the Kansas City Chiefs 31-28 on Thanksgiving Day.The Cowboys enter Thursday's showdown just one-half game behind the Lions in the NFC and will be facing what could be a severely limited Detroit aerial attack. Already missing tight end Sam LaPorta (back) for what may be the rest of the season, the Lions will be without Kalif Raymond (ankle) for a second straight week, and fellow wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown is listed as questionable due to the ankle injury he suffered against the Packers last week.\nConversely, Dallas' passing game is firing on all cylinders. Dak Prescott, who is second in the NFL in both passing yards (3,261) and touchdown tosses (25), has posted back-to-back 300-yard performances and has made eight TD throws against just two interceptions during the Cowboys' current winning streak.Offseason acquisition George Pickens is second in the league with 1,142 receiving yards and third with eight touchdown catches, while CeeDee Lamb has hauled in a scoring pass in two of his last three contests. Meanwhile, tight end Jake Ferguson has seven TD receptions this year after registering the same amount in 47 games over his first three NFL seasons.Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the Cowboys have the league's top passing offense with an average of 271.3 yards per game. Dallas also is first in the NFL in total offense (393.1 yards) and ranks second in scoring (29.3 points).Even if they are thin on receivers, the Lions still have enough pieces to compete with the Cowboys. Jahmyr Gibbs is the NFL's fourth-leading rusher with 1,019 yards and is tied for third in the league with 13 total touchdowns - including 10 on the ground. Veteran David Montgomery also is a threat, as he has six TD runs, and Jared Goff is even with Prescott in scoring passes with 25.Detroit is third in the NFL in both total offense (376.3 yards) and scoring (29.2 points) while ranking fourth in rushing with an average of 138.1 yards. The club is seventh in passing offense (238.2 yards), but the potential absence of St. Brown - who is fifth in league with 884 receiving yards and second with nine TD catches - would be a major blow.SportsLine's Inside the Lines team feels both teams must win in order to seriously keep alive their playoff hopes. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, a loss would drop Detroit's postseason chances under 19%, while Dallas' prospects would sink below 10%.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 14 WINWITH WEEK 14 LOSSDIFFERENCEDetroit Lions37.8%53.4%18.6%34.8%Dallas Cowboys24.5%41.5%9.8%31.7%The Lions have a much more difficult road ahead of them, as they have matchups against the NFC West-leading Los Angeles Rams (9-3), Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6) and Bears (9-3) on their schedule following their meeting with Dallas. The Cowboys will face just one team with a winning record - the 8-4 Los Angeles Chargers - over their final four contests, as they have meetings with the Minnesota Vikings (4-8), Washington Commanders (3-9) and New York Giants (2-11) ahead of them.Chicago and Green Bay both have tough battles remaining. In addition to facing each other twice, the Bears also take on the San Francisco 49ers (9-4) and Lions while the Packers square off against the AFC West-best Denver Broncos (10-2)  and AFC North-leading Baltimore Ravens (6-6). However, the model still gives Detroit just an 11% chance to win the NFC North with a victory over Dallas.As for the Cowboys, their outlook for overtaking the Eagles in the NFC East is bleak. Philadelphia has showdowns with the Chargers and Buffalo Bills (8-4) on its slate, but it also faces Washington twice and Las Vegas. Even with a triumph on Thursday night, the model says Dallas' chances to win the division are less than 23%.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC NORTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 14 WINWITH WEEK 14 LOSSDIFFERENCEDetroit Lions6.9%11.0%1.9%9.1%Chicago Bears40.5%69.6%27.0%42.6%Green Bay Packers52.7%66.8%22.1%44.7%CHANCES OF WINNING NFC EASTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 14 WINWITH WEEK 14 LOSSDIFFERENCEDallas Cowboys13.5%22.5%6.2%16.3%Philadelphia Eagles86.5%94.0%79.3%14.7%The Cowboys are 17-12 against the Lions in the regular season and won five consecutive meetings prior to last year, when Detroit cruised to a 47-9 victory at Dallas in Week 6.

    "body": "\n        Arkansas entered its game against Louisville with a 5-2 record that featured no good wins and no bad losses. In simple terms, the Razorbacks had beaten everyone they were supposed to beat and lost to everyone they were supposed to lose to.That changed Tuesday.Despite closing as a 2-point home underdog, Arkansas controlled the game from start to finish, led by as many as 20, never trailed and walked out of Bud Walton Arena with an 89-80 victory.Coach John Calipari is now 20-8 all-time against Louisville, including a 14-3 mark since leaving Memphis for Kentucky in March 2009. Naturally, Calipari was asked about his relationship with the Cardinals after spending 15 seasons coaching their chief rival.\"Louisville's fine with me,\" Calipari said, noting his long and friendly relationship with the late Denny Crum. \"We played them a bunch, beat them more than we lost to them. Tried to downplay the game, tell them it's just one game so people wouldn't lose their minds -- but they didn't listen to me.\"No, they did not.\nEither way, how about Arkansas? In front of a capacity crowd -- and with new football coach Ryan Silverfield firing up the students -- the Razorbacks got 21 points and five rebounds from Trevon Brazile, the lone holdover from the Eric Musselman era, and handed Louisville its first loss of the season.

The Longhorns moved up one spot to No. 2 after wins over South Carolina and UCLA during the Players Era Tournament in Las Vegas.Vic Schaefer's group put on a defensive clinic while also proving their offense has improved significantly from last season -- which says a lot about how dangerous this team is since they made it to the Final Four even without 3-point shooters. South Carolina is the No. 3 team this week because the Gamecocks could have won the trophy, or at least gone to overtime in the Player Era championship game, had it not been for Rori Harmon hitting a clutch winning shot. Despite losing to Texas, UCLA got to stay at No. 4 because the Bruins responded well with dominant wins over Duke and Tennessee.This is a fun week for college basketball because of the ACC/SEC challenge. No. 5 LSU has scored 100+ points in each of its first eight games, but Duke's defense should challenge the Tigers a little more than their previous opponents. Another game worth watching will be Ole Miss vs. Notre Dame, who are ranked No. 16 and No. 19, respectively. Coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin's team is currently undefeated, but the Fighting Irish, led by Hannah Hidalgo, will be giving them their toughest test yet.NC State almost fell out this week, but their 103-98 overtime loss to Oklahoma on Wednesday might have been the Wolfpack's best performance so far. The Sooners' win helped them slide up to No. 7, and Wes Moore's team gets to hang around a little longer at No. 25. Meanwhile, Stanford almost pulled off an upset against Tennessee and was just a few points away from entering the top 25.Iowa State entered the top 10 thanks to a win over Indiana in which star Audi Crooks scored 47 points, breaking the same program record she set last month in her own version of a Michael Jordan flu game. Next Wednesday, Iowa State faces the biggest test of its season when the Iowa Hawkeyes come to town. Considering Iowa vaulted to No. 12 this week, that game is sure to have a big impact on the standings next week.Here are the latest CBS Sports women's college basketball Power Rankings.\nWomen's

    "body": "\n        Conference championship games are upon us and, with that, a few Heisman Trophy contenders have one final opportunity to impress voters before the Dec. 13 ceremony. The battle for college football's top honor often comes down to championship week, and that was the case just a year ago, when Boise State's Ashton Jeanty made a last-minute push and nearly jumped ahead of eventual winner Travis Hunter. This season, all eyes are on Ohio State's Julian Sayin and Indiana's Fernando Mendoza.The Big Ten Championship Game could decide the Heisman winner. Things have been trending in this direction for weeks, and with both Ohio State and Indiana completing perfect regular seasons, they set up a war between two longtime award frontrunners. Sayin and Mendoza have been neck and neck at the front of the Heisman race for much of the season and this weekend will have an opportunity to notch a critical head-to-head win.That data point, which directly compares Sayin to Mendoza, may be the deciding factor for voters split between the two. The wild card is whether Vanderbilt's Diego Pavia has done enough to win the award regardless of what happens in the Big Ten title bout.Here is the full Heisman Trophy outlook for conference championship week.Heisman Trophy odds entering championship weekOdds via FanDuelQB Fernando Mendoza, Indiana (+165)QB Diego Pavia, Vanderbilt (+165)QB Julian Sayin, Ohio State (+220)RB Jeremiyah Love, Notre Dame (+5000)WR Jeremiah Smith, Ohio State (+20000)LB Jacob Rodriguez, Texas Tech (+25000)QB Gunner Stockton, Georgia (+30000)QB Ty Simpson, Alabama (+30000)Stock up: Diego Pavia vaults into frontrunner conversationSince Vanderbilt will be watching the SEC Championship Game from home, all Pavia can do is hope that his 12-game body of work is enough to justify the required number of first-place Heisman votes for a victory. There is a decent chance he will command strong support from regional voters in the south regardless of what happens in the Big Ten Championship Game, and if neither Sayin nor Mendoza has a particularly strong outing, that should help him gain more traction nationwide.\nEven with his two interceptions last week against Tennessee, Pavia's season-long numbers are phenomenal. The sixth-year star finished the regular season as the SEC leader in completion rate (71.2%), passing touchdowns (27) and efficiency with excellent per-attempt numbers and a stellar passer rating. He is also among the premier running threats at the quarterback position nationally and put that on display with a 165-yard outburst in the rivalry win over the Volunteers.All of those statistics pair beautifully with the fact that Pavia spearheaded the greatest regular season in Vanderbilt history with 10 wins and its highest AP Top 25 ranking (No. 9) in the modern era. His publicity does not hurt either. Arguably no candidate has campaigned harder nor boasts the same kind of social media support that Pavia possesses. That goes a long way.Stock down: Jeremiyah Love likely a finalist at bestAn ill-timed injury might have dashed Jeremiyah Love's hopes of hoisting the trophy. The dominant Notre Dame running back missed part of last week's rout of Stanford after taking a hit to his midsection, and while he did return to the contest, the time off the field prevented him from posting one of his typical outrageous stat lines.\nIt would have taken another monster effort from Love to assert himself as the Heisman frontrunner to begin with. Considering the Fighting Irish do not have a conference championship game, Love needed to close the regular season with a bang. Instead, the momentum is simply not in his favor.That is not to say that Love will not receive Heisman votes. In fact, he may well earn enough to claim a seat at the ceremony. He is the most prolific running back in college football and perhaps the most likely non-quarterback to be a finalist. But it takes a lot for a running back to win this award nowadays, and even with 1,652 scrimmage yards and 21 total touchdowns, he may not have done enough.Longshot of the week: LB Jacob Rodriguez, Texas Tech (+25000)Texas Tech is working hard to prove otherwise, but a defensive player simply is not going to win the Heisman this year. It will take a special set of circumstances for a strictly-defensive player to win in any year. But Jacob Rodriguez sure could be a finalist. He would be far from the first linebacker or edge rusher to clinch a spot at the ceremony, and voters have a tendency to go outside the box with their second- and third-place votes.\nThose who look beyond the quarterback position may be inclined to toss a vote Rodriguez's way after his dominant final campaign with the Red Raiders. The fifth-year senior leads the country with seven forced fumbles, and he racked up four interceptions, too. One of those takeaways came last week, when he also ran for his second touchdown in as many games. Coach Joey McGuire has been using Rodriguez as a goal-line rusher of late in a not-so-veiled attempt to pad his stats, and it just might work.Championship week performances to watchWhether it be for determining the Heisman winner or for rounding out the field of finalists, conference championship week presents an opportunity for a handful of hopefuls to make a last-minute push. Watch closely in the Big Ten, SEC and Big 12 for indications as to how the votes will be distributed.Julian Sayin vs. Fernando MendozaThis one is for all the marbles in multiple capacities. The Big Ten title is on the line. So, too, is the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. The Heisman Trophy may be at stake in this head-to-head fight between Sayin and Mendoza. The winner of the Ohio State-Indiana battle will almost certainly be the betting favorite for the award, so long as he does not play poorly. That victor will also have a perfect record as the leader of the nation's best team, not to mention a spectacular statistical profile, as well.\nGunner Stockton vs. Ty SimpsonUnder the assumption that Pavia is a finalist, there may be room for one other SEC quarterback at the Heisman ceremony, but anything beyond that is a stretch. The winning quarterback at the conference title game will have a strong case to pick up voting consideration, perhaps even as the No. 1 choice on a couple of outlier ballots. One of Stockton or Simpson could earn a ticket to New York this weekend, but not both.Jacob Rodriguez vs. BYUIf Rodriguez is to stand favorably enough among the other contending non-quarterbacks to clinch finalist status, he cannot be silent in the Big 12 Championship Game. He was far from quiet in his first meeting with BYU, when he tied his season-best mark with 14 tackles and added a tackle for loss, interception and fumble recovery. A repeat performance, maybe with a rushing touchdown for show, could get Rodriguez on enough ballots to matter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In June of 2024, Art Rooney II gave Mike Tomlin a three-year extension while exuding confidence that Tomlin could get the Steelers \"back to winning playoff games and championships, while continuing our tradition of success.\"Flash forward to this past Sunday night, when chants rang out from Steelers fans calling for Tomlin's firing amid one of the franchise's worst home losses in recent memory. After a 4-1 start, the Steelers' recent slide -- they've lost five of their last seven games -- has led to increased frustration from fans who no longer want to hear about Tomlin and the franchise's consecutive non-losing seasons streak. The recent losses have also led to rampant speculation about Tomlin's future in Pittsburgh. \n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin on hot seat? Coach offers legitimate reason why Steelers fans are justified calling for his head\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere's no denying that Tomlin has had a long and successful tenure with the Steelers that includes a Super Bowl win, another Super Bowl appearance, seven division titles and 12 playoff appearances. But it's also necessary to point out that the Steelers haven't won a playoff game in nearly nine years and have won just three playoff games since 2011. That is the main source of frustration for a fan base that desperately wants to return to its glory years. Where will the Steelers go from here? Is this really Tomlin's final season in Pittsburgh, or will the Steelers go on another patented run during the season's final five games that will put Tomlin's future with the franchise on the back burner? \nMost likely outcome: Tomlin remains with SteelersWhile it's noisy now, Tomlin remaining in Pittsburgh next season remains the most likely outcome for several reasons. Let's start with the fact that the Steelers are currently tied for first place in their division and will be in sole possession of first place in the AFC North if they defeat the Ravens Sunday in Baltimore. If the Steelers win the division and the subsequent playoff berth that comes with it, you can kiss any thoughts of Tomlin and the Steelers parting ways goodbye. There is a good chance Tomlin will have to make changes to his coaching staff, especially on defense, as that unit has woefully underperformed so far. \nTomlin's status for next year likely has nothing to do with whatever happens in the playoffs (if Pittsburgh makes the postseason). While Rooney wants to see the Steelers end their drought without a playoff win, it's hard to fathom him going as far as to part ways with Tomlin after yet another playoff berth. The most likely long-term outcome is Tomlin finishing out his contract (which runs through the 2027 season) and pursuing another opportunity after that, whether it's in coaching, broadcasting, or something else. Unless the Steelers have another deep playoff run before now and then, it's a safe bet that the two sides amicably part ways when Tomlin's contract expires after the 2027 season. Least likely outcome: Steelers fire Tomlin There's a better chance of August snowfall than the Steelers firing Tomlin. It just won't happen, unless the Steelers lose every game from here on out and finish with their worst record since 1988. But even in that scenario, the more likely outcome would be a mutual split (we'll revisit that later). \nThe Steelers don't fire coaches, especially one who has added to their collection of Lombardi Trophies. There's also the fact that Tomlin still has two years left on his current contract. Unlike at some major college football programs, coaching contracts still mean something to some people, including Rooney. You could make a case for firing Tomlin if the Steelers' drought without a playoff run continues into 2026. But it's not a strong one, given that Pittsburgh's projected win/loss total prior to this season was set at 8.5 games. This team wasn't considered a legitimate Super Bowl contender then, and that has been reinforced through the season's first 12 games. According to the oddsmakers at FanDuel, the Steelers (-300) are favored to miss the postseason next month.This would be a good place to point out the fact that Tomlin is coaching a team with several gaping holes, especially at receiver (why Steelers GM Omar Khan never pulled the trigger on acquiring another wideout after trading George Pickens is nothing short of baffling). While Tomlin does have a big say in personnel decisions, he ultimately is not the general manager. He can only coach the players he has available. \nAgain, barring a complete collapse, the odds of you winning the lottery are better than the odds of the Steelers firing their first head coach in over 55 years. Other possible outcomes Steelers and Tomlin mutually split This one is starting to pick up steam, especially if the Steelers don't win a playoff game, miss the playoffs altogether and/or finish with a losing record. Rooney gave Tomlin his most recent contract extension, hoping he could get the Steelers back to competing for Super Bowls. While he's only two years into his extension, a second consecutive season that falls well short of expectations could compel Rooney to go in a different direction. \nRooney is likely willing to give Tomlin the end of his contract to deliver that long-awaited playoff win, but the fan base is quickly running out of patience. Fans typically don't drive decisions this big, but they can if money is involved. A notable number of Packers fans, for example, managed to get tickets for Green Bay's win in Pittsburgh back in Week 8. Scenes like that could become more frequent if the number of disillusioned Steelers fans continues to increase. More so, a second straight season that ends with a long losing skid -- Pittsburgh lost its last five games last season -- could be enough to convince Rooney that change is needed. If Tomlin also feels that it's time for a change, it's certainly possible that the two sides amicably split. \nFrom Tomlin's perspective, it's easy to see why he may be ready for a change. While he has said numerous times that he has the best job in football, Tomlin may nonetheless want to continue his career in a place where he will be more appreciated by the fan base. A 9-8 record with the Giants or Falcons, for example, isn't the same as going 9-8 in Pittsburgh.  Steelers trade Tomlin While it doesn't happen much, NFL coaches have been traded before. In fact, Tomlin's old boss, Jon Gruden, was traded from Oakland to Tampa Bay ahead of the 2002 season. Ironically, Gruden defeated his former employer in that year's Super Bowl with Tomlin serving as his defensive backs coach. Steelers fans always hear that Tomlin would get another coaching job quicker than a DoorDash delivery if he ever parted ways with Pittsburgh. If that's truly the case (it undoubtedly is), then why wouldn't the Steelers try to get something in return? This would likely require Tomlin's blessing, which he may be willing to do. \nIf he were traded, Tomlin would join Gruden and Bill Belichick as notable head coaches who have been dealt from one team to another. That's not bad company to be part of. In fact, being traded could elevate Tomlin's legacy if he were able to mimic the success that Gruden and Belichick had after being dealt. The 53-year-old Tomlin has built a Hall of Fame-worthy career during his 19 seasons in Pittsburgh. A trade would not only give him a new opportunity to make an impact elsewhere, but it would also ensure his legacy in Pittsburgh as a championship-winning coach who successfully carried on the franchise's winning tradition. \n            ",

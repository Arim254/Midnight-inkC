Head to SportsLine to see them. \nBautista vs. Oliveira   preview Bautista, 32, should have the locals in his corner come Saturday as he's a Nevada native but is fighting out of Scottsdale, Ariz. His background is in BJJ, and he began his professional MMA career in 2017. He made his UFC debut two years later, and after splitting his first four bouts with the promotion, he then ripped off a lengthy winning streak. Bautista won eight straight fights, which included a victory over UFC Hall of Famer, Jose Aldo, in 2024.The eighth victory then came in his next fight before the streak ended with a decision defeat to Umar Nurmagomedov in October 2025. That was the first decision loss of Bautista's 19-match career, as he also has a lone defeat via knockout and one via submission. Most of his victories have come via submission or the scorecards as he hasn't won by knocking out his opponent in any of his last 10 bouts, despite posting an 8-2 record. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 30-year-old Oliveira hails from Brazil and won each of his first 10 pro MMA fights in the first round, eight coming with a knockout. He'd then suffer losses in two of his next three bouts but has rebounded since and been nearly unbeatable. In his dozen fights since then, which span nearly seven years, Oliveira sports an 11-1 record. He won via first-round KO in Dana White's Contender Series in 2023 to earn a UFC contract, and he's won his four bouts with the promotion.\nOver the span of those four, Oliveira has been awarded Fight of the Night twice and Performance of the Night once. With a 70.5-inch reach, the Brazilian is a knockout specialist as 16 of his 23 wins have come via the KO, compared to five from a decision and two via submission. Oliveira has never submitted in his MMA career, nor loss via the judges, as all three of his defeats have come via knockout. You can only see the model's UFC picks and analysis at SportsLine. UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira   predictionsOne of the model's top UFC Fight Night picks: It is backing Julius Walker at +140 (8.3% edge) against Dustin Jacoby (-166).\"Jacoby's experience is reflected in the betting line, but Walker's metrics suggest this fight is much closer than the odds imply. Walker lands with higher accuracy, absorbs less damage, and carries legitimate knockout upside. The SportsLine model projects Jacoby to win just 53.2% of the time, making the underdog price on Walker particularly attractive given his finishing potential,\" McClure told SportsLine. See who else to back here. \nYou can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira   picksThe model has picks for Bautista vs. Oliveira   and other bouts on the UFC card.

    "body": "\nSuper Bowl 60 will be the 10th rematch in the history of The Big Game as the New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. The Pats won their Super Bowl 49 meeting, and the winner of the first Super Bowl meeting is 6-3 all-time in the rematch. The Pats are the AFC's No. 2 seed after a 14-3 regular season and wins over the Chargers, Texans and Broncos in the 2026 NFL playoffs as New England has won six in a row overall. The Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed after also going 14-3, followed by postseason victories over the 49ers and Rams, as the Seahawks are on a nine-game win streak. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds via DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5.

His team set the record for the highest winning percentage in the contest's history at the time, nailing 72.5% (58-22-5 ATS). Kannon has also crushed his recent NFL picks, going 29-15-2 (+1208) in his last 46 NFL against the spread picks. Now, Kannon has set his sights on Seahawks vs. Patriots and just locked in his picks and predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see his picks.

The 8.7 ppg allowed by the Patriots in the 2026 NFL playoffs are the fewest through three playoff games since the Super Bowl-winning 2000 Ravens. On offense, Drake Maye who is +240 in the Super Bowl MVP odds, is the first quarterback to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason since the 1970 merger, and as a whole, the Pats finished the regular season in the top 3 in both points scored and yards gained. Additionally, the underdog has outright won in three straight Super Bowls and covered in five straight, with each of those the longest streaks in Big Game history. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverSeattle has played turnover-free ball over their last three games, and it is the only undefeated team (10-0) this season when committing 1 or fewer turnovers. Not giving the ball away keeps its No. 3 scoring offense on the field, and it's an explosive unit that leads the NFL in yards per pass completion (7.5). The other side of the ball ranks even better, topping the league, and No. 1 scoring defenses are 14-4 in the Super Bowl since 1970. The Seahawks are also the first team in a decade to rank in the top two in both yards per rush allowed (3.7, 1st) and yards per pass allowed (5.5, 2nd). In terms of the spread, Seattle is a league-best 14-5 ATS this season, as well as 8-1 versus the line away from home. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Seahawks  picksKannon has analyzed Seahawks vs. Patriots from every possible angle.

Seattle lost its opener to San Francisco and fell to 3-2 after a Week 5 loss to Tampa Bay, but ripped off wins in 13 of the next 14 games to earn its way into the Big Game. Meanwhile, New England lost two of its first three but has won 16 of its last 17.Sam Darnold and Drake Maye both looked like NFL MVP candidates at points throughout the season, though they'll likely fall short to Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Darnold has rejuvenated his career by throwing 60 touchdown passes in the last two seasons and Maye became the youngest player in NFL history to lead the league in completion percentage (72.0%). Darnold is the +120 favorite to win the Big Game MVP, while Maye is +240. Both teams were top five in the NFL in scoring offense and scoring defense, and the SportsLine Projection Model is predicting thin margins against the spread and with the over/under. It's slightly leaning towards Seattle to cover against the spread based on the percentages and also projects that the Under hits in 59% of its 10,000 simulations of the Big Game, higher than the implied odds of 52.2%.Exact score prediction: Seattle Seahawks 24, New England Patriots 20 (best odds +15000 at BetMGM):Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Two of those three wins came on the road in Chapel Hill, where Saturday's contest takes place, including an 82-69 final last year. Duke is 21-1 overall and 10-0 in ACC play with another star-studded young roster, led by star freshman Cameron Boozer. The son of 13-year NBA forward Carlos Boozer and projected NBA lottery pick is averaging 23.3 points and 9.9 rebounds per game this season. Duke has won 10 straight, with nine of those victories coming by at least six points. The model projects Duke to cover in 55% of simulations. Back Duke to cover at DraftKings here:Illinois (+1.5) vs. Michigan State (-110)\"Michigan State has lost its only two conference games against ranked opponents (Michigan and Nebraska),\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"They have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten, inflating their defensive stats. When faced with a Tier-1 offense (like Michigan's), their defense cracked. Illinois presents an even more potent offensive challenge than Michigan. Close Game Separation Metrics heavily favor Illinois. In tight games, Illinois has consistently executed in the half-court, whereas Michigan State has suffered from subpar backcourt play from everyone not named Jeremy Fears Jr. Illinois has validated these numbers away from home. Their Strength of Schedule adjusted performance includes road wins at Purdue and Nebraska — two of the toughest environments in the Big Ten. I like the road team in this spot.\" Back Illinois to cover at DraftKings here:Lakers (-2.5) vs. Warriors (-118)Luka Doncic (hamstring) is out for the Lakers, but the model still gives the Lakers the nod in this matchup. The Lakers defeated the 76ers, 119-115, on Thursday despite losing Doncic after he played just 16 minutes. Los Angeles rallied from an eight-point halftime deficit without Doncic, led by an Austin Reaves takeover. Reaves had 35 points and LeBron James added 17 points and 10 assists Thursday. Stephen Curry (knee) is out for the Warriors as well, so both teams will be without some of their star power.

Bet it at bet365 here:Duke (-5.5) vs. North CarolinaDuke is unbeaten in ACC play this season, sitting alone atop the league standings. North Carolina has dropped three games against conference opponents and nearly blew a 32-point lead against Syracuse on Monday. The Blue Devils are led by one of the best freshmen in college basketball, as Cameron Boozer ranks second nationally with 23.3 points per game. Duke has covered the spread in five of its last six games, and SportsLine's computer model has the Blue Devils covering this number in 54% of simulations. Back Duke at bet365 here:\nOver 232.5 in Bulls vs. NuggetsChicago plays at the seventh-fastest pace in the NBA, and that has not changed after some new acquisitions earlier this week. The Bulls added Jaden Ivey from the Pistons and Anfernee Simons from the Celtics, giving them more firepower to keep pace with Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets. Jokic had 30 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists against the Knicks on Wednesday. The Nuggets have gone Over in five straight games, and these teams have gone Over in five straight head-to-head meetings.

They have feasted on the bottom of the Big Ten, inflating their defensive stats,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"When faced with a Tier-1 offense (like Michigan's), their defense cracked. Illinois presents an even more potent offensive challenge than Michigan. Close Game Separation Metrics heavily favor Illinois. In tight games, Illinois has consistently executed in the half-court, whereas Michigan State has suffered from subpar backcourt play from everyone not named Jeremy Fears Jr. Illinois has validated these numbers away from home. Their Strength of Schedule adjusted performance includes road wins at Purdue and Nebraska—two of the toughest environments in the Big Ten.

    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -230 money line favorites (risk $230 to win $100), while the Patriots are +190 underdogs. Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III is -190 (risk $190 to win $100) to score a touchdown, and his over/under for rushing yards is 70.5. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

    "body": "\nFrom Super Bowl props like Kenneth Walker III anytime touchdown (-190) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl 60 three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+330). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the divisional round and then got a red-zone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC title game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which matches Hunter Henry for the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The final NFL DFS slate of the season arrives on Sunday at Levi's Stadium when the 2026 Super Bowl unfolds between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots (+4.5, 45.5 at DraftKings) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Some of the year's biggest daily Fantasy producers will be on display as Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was second among receivers in Fantasy points, while New England quarterback Drake Maye was third among quarterbacks. They'll be popular NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60, but who are the daily Fantasy sleeper picks who can create salary cap space to build a winning roster? Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the 2026 Super Bowl, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.\nNow, McClure has turned his attention to the 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60 is Smith-Njigba, who is looking to cap a monster season where he led the NFL in receiving yardage at 1,793. After a relatively quiet week in the divisional round, he got back to his dominant ways against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, posting a 10-153-1 receiving line. By Super Bowl standards, the Patriots did not have an elite Fantasy defense against receivers this season, ranking 10th in Fantasy points allowed to that position group. They've also given up a touchdown to an opposing receiver in three of the past four games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Smith-Njigba to go Over 94.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp. The 32-year-old has become a secondary option this season, but he has seen his target share increase a bit in the NFL playoffs. That helped lead to a touchdown against the Rams in the NFC title game. With elite New England cornerback Christian Gonzalez likely shadowing Smith-Njigba for much of the game, there's a great chance that Kupp will get more opportunities on Sunday, all at a very affordable NFL DFS price. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Kupp to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in Patriots vs. Seahawks. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for the Super Bowl, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        North Dakota State and the Mountain West Conference are engaged in deep discussions on a deal that would bring the FCS powerhouse into the conference as a football-only member starting this fall, a source familiar with the negotiations told CBS Sports on Friday.A deal had not been finalized as of Friday night, but progress was being made toward an agreement that would elevate North Dakota State to the FBS level. Such a move would require a negotiated entry fee paid to the Mountain West, in addition to the NCAA's $5 million FBS transition fee. The size of the Mountain West's entry fee remains under discussion, a source said.If completed, the move would mark one of the most significant FCS-to-FBS transitions in recent history. North Dakota State has won 10 national championships since 2011, including its most recent title in 2024. They are 9-5 all-time against FBS opponents, with five wins over power conference programs.The program has publicly signaled its desire to move to the FBS level in recent months under athletic director Matt Larsen and outgoing university president David Cook, who is set to become president at Iowa State University on March 1. Cook's final day at North Dakota State is Sunday, potentially setting the stage for a notable final act.\nLarsen said last month that the school's interest in exploring FBS membership was \"as strong as it's ever been.\"\"I would say in terms of our position, I think both myself and president Cook, we want to play at the highest level,\" Larsen said on \"Hot Mic with Dom Izzo\" on Jan. 22. \"And right now, the highest level is FBS football. The things that we've done over the course of the last decade have positioned us to be able to do that. And if there's an opportunity, I think it's something we would absolutely explore. If there's not an opportunity, we're poised to continue competing at FCS at a really, really high level and compete for championships.\"At the time, Larsen said the Mountain West had not initiated contact with NDSU. Talks between Mountain West leadership, conference presidents and North Dakota State administrators intensified earlier this week, sources told CBS Sports.\nThe negotiations come during a pivotal stretch for the Mountain West. The conference announced new media rights agreements this week with CBS Sports, FOX Sports and Kiswe through the 2031-32 season, and added The CW under a five-year deal running through 2030-31.The league is also preparing for the departures of Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Utah State, all of which will join the re-formed Pac-12 next fall. The Mountain West has backfilled those openings with UTEP, UC Davis, and Northern Illinois. Hawaii was added as a football-only member in 2012 but joins in all sports beginning in 2026. Northern Illinois will join as a football-only member in 2026, while UC Davis' football program will remain in the FCS as a member of the Big Sky Conference.The Mountain West will continue to play an eight-game conference schedule in football next season, a source said. Matchups for the 2026 season were announced in December, though dates have not yet been finalized. Projected schedules that include North Dakota State are now being modeled and would require minor adjustments.\nIf North Dakota State finalizes a move to the Mountain West, the program would be required to complete a two-year transition period at the FBS level, rendering it ineligible for the College Football Playoff and bowl games in 2026 and 2027. The school could still accept a bowl bid if there are not enough bowl-eligible teams to fill available slots.There are currently 136 FBS programs. Delaware and Missouri State completed their first full FBS seasons in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pro Football Hall of Fame is weighing possible adjustments to its selection process after a contentious voting year that left former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick outside the Class of 2026. Hall of Fame president Jim Porter told the Associated Press that the organization plans to review both procedure and enforcement following backlash from fans and some voters, though he emphasized the discussion extends beyond any single candidate. Belichick, eligible for the first time, failed to secure the required 80% support from the 50-member selection committee despite a résumé that includes six Super Bowl titles as a head coach and eight overall.Among the most immediate changes under consideration is a return to in-person voting. The committee has met virtually since the COVID-19 pandemic, but Porter said face-to-face discussion could improve clarity and accountability. The Hall of Fame is also likely to move the final vote closer to the NFL Honors ceremony, a shift aimed at limiting leaks that surfaced during the more than three-week gap this year.\n        \n            \n                Bill Belichick's snub demands a Hall of Fame reckoning\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPorter added that the Hall of Fame may revisit whether to disclose vote totals or even individual ballots in the future, though no such information will be released for the 2026 class. He also said the Hall of Fame will evaluate whether any selectors violated voting rules, including discussing confidential deliberations publicly or failing to follow instructions to vote strictly for the most deserving candidates.\nThat issue came into focus after Kansas City Star columnist and voter Vahe Gregorian publicly explained his decision to select senior-era players Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood over Belichick. Gregorian wrote that he viewed the senior candidates as facing potential \"last chances\" for induction. Porter said that rationale runs counter to the rules.\"That's not an option,\" Porter said, noting voters are repeatedly instructed to choose only the most deserving candidates, regardless of category or future eligibility.The controversy has renewed criticism of rule changes implemented last year that combined senior players -- those retired at least 25 years -- with coaches and contributors into a single ballot. Under the format, voters select three of five finalists, with only the top vote-getter and anyone exceeding the 80% threshold earning induction. Craig was the lone candidate to clear that bar this year.\nIt marked the third straight year without a coach being elected, prompting calls from some selectors to once again separate coaches and contributors from senior players. Porter said he is not inclined toward that change, noting that for decades all groups were evaluated together.\n        \n            \n                Pro Football Hall of Fame 2026: Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Roger Craig headline five-member induction class\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nStill, the Hall of Fame is assessing broader trends. It is the second consecutive year with fewer than five modern-era inductees after another rule change narrowed the final ballot. After 12 straight years with at least seven inductees, only five were elected this year and four last year.\"We'll do some tweaks and we'll take a look,\" Porter said. \"We're going to do what's best for the Hall of Fame. My job is to protect the integrity of the Hall, protect the integrity of the process.\"\nBelichick, now coaching at North Carolina, was described by associates as \"puzzled\" and \"disappointed\" by the outcome. Some voters cited past Patriots scandals as a factor, underscoring the tensions the Hall of Fame now hopes to address through potential procedural changes.\n            ",

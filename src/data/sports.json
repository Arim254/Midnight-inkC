The former has advantages over his opponent in a number of metrics, including significant strikes landed per minute, significant strikes accuracy and takedowns average. Bukauskas also lacks a diversified attack as just one of his last 17 bouts have seen him win via submission, while Krylov has over a dozen MMA wins via both submission and with a knockout.\"[Krylov] seems very focused in this training camp and is still only 33 years old,\" Vithlani told SportsLine. \"If Krylov can find his old form, his MMA game will be a lot more diverse than Bukauskas.

    "body": "\n        Dabo Swinney set the scene, delivered the facts and even revealed documented timestamps highlighting Ole Miss coach Pete Golding's efforts to swipe Clemson transfer portal signee Luke Ferrelli this week. After initially signing with the Tigers, Ferrelli re-entered the transfer portal and committed to Ole Miss on Thursday.The NCAA's pending decision, following written validation from the Tigers, could set off a chain reaction of tampering disclosures across college football, where rampant tampering is assumed, but left mostly up to interpretation in the NIL and transfer portal era.Rules enforcement is supposed to be top priority for the NCAA.\"We have a broken system, and if there are no consequences for tampering, then we have no rules and we have no governance,\" Swinney said Friday.Swinney said he had previously warned the Rebels that he would blow the whistle on what he considered under-the-table recruiting if Golding and Ole Miss failed to back off the former California linebacker, who signed with Clemson on Jan. 7 and moved from the West Coast to South Carolina four days later.\nFerrelli was the ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2025, leading all first-year players in solo tackles (87). \"The GM (Ole Miss' Austin Thomas) assured (Clemson GM) Jordan (Sorrells) that he had communicated to the agent that he wanted no part of this and that his relationship with Jordan was more important to him than Luke Ferrelli, but that 'Pete Golding just does what he does,'\" Swinney said. Swinney said he spoke with his athletic director, Graham Neff and ACC commissioner Jim Phillips and NCAA compliance about the situation with a formal complaint. He said the SEC commissioner, Greg Sankey, was also looped in. \nSwinney alleged that Golding texted Ferrelli a photo of a \"$1 million contract\" and asked about his buyout at Clemson.\"The NCAA will investigate any credible allegations of tampering and expect full cooperation from all involved as is required by NCAA rules,\" NCAA Vice President of enforcement Jon Duncan said in a statement Friday to On3. \"We will not comment further on any ongoing investigation.\"Ironically, it was Golding and Ole Miss who were concerned over tampering during the College Football Playoff with fear former Rebels coach Lane Kiffin was targeting players to join him at LSU. Numerous Ole Miss players left for LSU even after reportedly signing rev-share contracts, including pass-rusher Princewill Umanmielen; Rebels247 says Ole Miss is getting a collective $1 million in buyout money paid back because Umanmielen and offensive lineman Devin Harper reneged on their executable contracts. \nDuke sued former quarterback Darian Mensah this week in the wake of his last-minute portal request with intentions to sign with Miami. In a 44-page document filed Tuesday morning, Duke argues that Mensah broke his contractual agreement with the Blue Devils should not be allowed to enter the portal so the two sides can enter and engage in arbitration the two sides agreed within the terms of the deal to settle disputes. The NCAA placed Michigan State on three years probation and vacated 14 wins in November following violations committed by former staff members during Mel Tucker's tenure. The NCAA found that Tucker and his former staff failed to properly oversee the program, resulting in violations involving three ineligible players. Investigators determined that staff arranged impermissible recruiting inducements and benefits, covered unofficial visit expenses and engaged in improper contact with recruits.In June 2025, Wisconsin sued Miami for alleged tampering with former player Xavier Lucas, who signed with the Hurricanes during the winter transfer portal cycle last year. According to legal documents, the Badgers accused Miami of poaching Lucas away from their roster ahead of the 2025 season and reaching out to the player despite his contract situation in the Big Ten.\nThese are only three of many examples in college football's new era of no-holds-barred recruiting in the portal.Potential punishment for Ole MissAccording to NCAA bylaw 13.1.1.4, tampering is against the rules and falls under the category of reaching out to players on opposing teams.\"An athletics staff member or other representative of the institution's athletics interests shall not communicate or make contact with the student-athlete of another NCAA Division I institution, or any individual associated with the student-athlete (e.g., family member, scholastic or non-scholastic coach, advisor), directly or indirectly, without first obtaining authorization through the notification of transfer process,\" the rulebook states. \"Before making contact, directly or indirectly, with a student-athlete of an NCAA Division II or Division III institution, or an NAIA four-year collegiate institution, an athletics staff member or other representative of the institution's athletics interests shall comply with the rule of the applicable division or the NAIA rule for making contact with a student-athlete.\"If the NCAA finds the Rebels guilty of contacting Ferrelli while he was enrolled at Clemson, that would likely result in a Level II recruiting violation for Ole Miss, per NCAA rules. If it's discovered that Ferrelli was offered money to leave the Tigers for the Rebels, as Swinney says he has proof, there's a chance Ole Miss could get hit with a more severe Level I violation.Under a Level I designation relating to illegal benefits, NCAA rules determine that as a \"cash payment or other benefits provided by a coach, administrator or representative of the institution's athletics interests intended to secure, or which resulted in, enrollment of a prospective student-athlete.\"\nFurthermore, a Level I reprimand within recruiting is defined by \"third-party involvement in recruiting violations in which institutional staff members knew or should have known about the involvement.\"Ole Miss currently holds the No. 2 transfer portal class in the country, per 247Sports. That includes the arrival of former Auburn quarterback Deuce Knight, former LSU offensive tackle Carius Curne and ex-Oregon edge Blake Purchase.The only team, right now, with a better collection of talent in its portal group is LSU. \n            ",

Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 46 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in nearly 60% of simulations in an A-rated pick. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Rams vs. Seahawks, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time in an A-rated pick?

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to four teams, with both conference championship games taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the latest NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC title game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are now 4.5-point home underdogs to utilize in NFL picks after opening at -5.5.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with that NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. Thus, there is a lot to consider before making any NFL playoff bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (42.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under (-102) using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        Saturday marks the first UFC event of the year, as well as the first UFC event of the Paramount Era, when UFC 324 comes to Las Vegas. The stacked card is headlined by an interim lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett.Gaethje has already held the interim lightweight title once in his career, as well as holding the ceremonial BMF title, but has never managed to hold an undisputed UFC championship. Regaining the interim title on Saturday is likely Gaethje's last path to finally achieving that feat.\"Of course, I have to that [title] in my body [of work],\" Gaethje told CBS Sports this week. \"I want to be the best in the world and prove that I am the best in the world. People need to understand how crazy this sport is. It's the most intriguing sport in the world because anything can happen at any moment. When a [football] team is up 42-10, there is no chance the [other] team is coming back. But when I was up 4-0 [in rounds] against Tony Ferguson, there was still a chance he could knock me out.\"To do so, Gaethje will have to get past a rising star in Pimblett, who is undefeated in his Octagon career and looking to score the biggest win of his career when he faces one of the most exciting fighters in MMA history.\nSign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 324 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!As with any UFC pay-per-view event, there's sure to be plenty of action at the sportsbook window, and with that in mind, we are taking a look at the best bet to make for every main card fight at UFC 324.  \n        \n            \n                UFC 324: Now more mature, Paddy Pimblett can make good on lofty expectations he had upon his UFC debut\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter going 31-25 for our best bets in 2025, we'll look keep our roll going to start the year on Saturday, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Bet UFC 324 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nArnold Allen\tvs.\tJean SilvaJean Silva via KO/TKO/DQ or submission +120Silva is a -258 favorite and you can get a line on him to win via either KO or decision at -250. Still, it seems the value is in taking Silva by some form of stoppage. Allen is a tough fighter who has never been stopped in his career. But Silva is nasty and dynamic in his attack, presenting a lot of problems for opponents. Allen has also been sidelined since a July 2024 win over Giga Chikadze. Coming back after a year and a half on the sidelines and having to face someone who brings the kind of wild pace that Silva does is a big ask. Silva's game is a little too wild at times, and Diego Lopes delivered a crushing reality check with a TKO win over Silva in September, but Silva has the right kind of opportunity to bounce back in a big way against Allen, who has lost two of his three most recent fights.Natalia Silva\tvs.\tRose NamajunasNatalia Silva via decision (-225)The line has moved slightly, with Namajunas having been around +320 a few days ago and now sitting at +300. This is a tough fight for the multiple-time former strawweight champion. Silva is on an absolute tear right now, with a 7-0 record in the Octagon and back-to-back wins over former UFC champions Jessica Andrade and Alexa Grasso. Namajunas' best chance to win is to get the fight to the ground, but Silva has shown excellent takedown defense against very good fighters. Namajunas has found ways to claw back from the brink of falling out of contention several times in her career, but Silva appears to be at the head of the next wave of flyweights. Five of Silva's seven UFC wins have come via decision and Namajunas seems unlikely to get stopped in a three-round fight, even if Silva gets the win.Waldo Cortes-Acosta\tvs.\tDerrick LewisOver 1.5 rounds (-145)Heavyweight is always something of a crapshoot, and it's entirely possible that picking the over in a fight involving UFC's all-time leader in knockouts (Lewis with 16) is the wrong play. Still, Lewis is facing a man in Cortes-Acosta who has played it safe in many of his fights. While he has back-to-back impressive knockouts of Ante Delija and Shamil Gaziev, it feels like Cortes-Acosta knows that the easiest path to victory is probably to work for takedowns off of leg kicks and try to score a grinding win. Lewis is good at getting up after being taken down, but he only defends takedowns at a 52% clip. That should lead to a fight that gets past the halfway point unless Lewis can find the opportunity to land one of his patented bombs for an early knockout.\nSean O'Malley\tvs.\tSong YadongSean O'Malley moneyline (-205)After winning the bantamweight title, O'Malley ran into the exact wrong kind of opponent in Merab Dvalishvili. Dvalishvili's relentless pace and takedown attack served as the perfect kryptonite to O'Malley's game. Fortunately for O'Malley, Yadong's game is nothing like that. Yadong does not have a strong takedown game and wants to operate on the feet. In the striking realm, O'Malley had the edge, with more creativity and sharpness, as well as high-level accuracy that should be enough for him to win almost every exchange. Add in that O'Malley knows this fight is close to do-or-die for his standing as a top bantamweight, and I expect the former champion to roll on Saturday night.\nJustin Gaethje\tvs.\tPaddy PimblettPaddy Pimblett moneyline (-230)Gaethje is the quintessential all-action fighter, and he has enough power to be a threat at any moment in any fight. Pimblett's length, creativity in pressuring with grappling and dynamic top game are going to present challenges for Gaethje, however. Gaethje is 37 and with a lot of miles on his body. He also has fought just once since his April 2024 last-second knockout loss to Max Holloway at UFC 300. There are too many things working in Pimblett's favor entering this fight to pick against him getting the biggest win of his career in the first main event of the Paramount era.Who wins Gaethje vs. Pimblett, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

Walker, 25, was taken into custody at the airport's Terminal C after telling a Delta Air Lines employee that his luggage contained a locked box holding a firearm, according to a criminal complaint obtained by the New York Post. Port Authority police were alerted and searched the bag, where they found a 9mm Glock pistol and 36 rounds of ammunition secured inside the locked case.Walker was charged with two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and one count of criminal possession of a firearm. He later appeared in Queens County Criminal Court on the gun charge and was released on his own recognizance. He is scheduled to return to court on March 19.Walker's attorney, Arthur Aidala, said the incident stemmed from a misunderstanding and that the firearm was legally licensed in Wisconsin, adding that Walker was unaware he could not travel with it in New York.\"It was in a locked box and he disclosed it to the people at the airport,\" Aidala told the New York Post. \"He told a person from Delta he was traveling with a firearm. He mistakenly thought because he had a licensed firearm and it was in a locked box that he was able to travel with it. We are confident the case will be dismissed.\"Selected by the Packers in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft, Walker has developed into a starting left tackle over his four pro seasons. Over the past three seasons, he has appeared in 51 games, making 48 starts. He started 16 of the team's 17 games this season -- the final year of his rookie contract -- and is about to enter free agency.\nThe Packers have not issued a public statement regarding Walker's arrest.\n            \n    ",

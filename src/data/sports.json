And the Raptors, on normal rest after cashing for us Sunday, are not a bad team that might well take care of business regardless. Toronto is also likely to get starting center Jakob Poeltl back from a three-game injury absence.\" Back Toronto at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Duke -8.5 vs. Texas (-115)The Longhorns hired Sean Miller away from Xavier last year and he did well to compose an experienced roster for his first season, but Texas will be much better off when he has a full recruiting cycle under its belt. Meanwhile, Duke lost its top five scorers from last season's Final Four team to the NBA but Jon Scheyer reloaded with the No. 1 recruiting class in the country. Cameron Boozer and Nikolas Khamenia could both be lotto picks next year and Caleb Foster, Isaiah Evans and Maliq Brown were all key depth pieces last year. The model predicts that the Blue Devils cover in 59% of simulations. Back Duke at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Over 233.5 points in Warriors vs. Suns (-115)The Over has hit in five of seven games for both the Suns and Warriors so far this season, and if you drill down a little further, the Over has hit in all three of Phoenix's road games while Golden State is 2-1 to the Over at home. The Over has also hit in six of the last 10 head-to-head matchups between these two franchises. Al Horford (toe) and Dillon Brooks (groin) have both been ruled out already, taking a solid defender off the board for both teams. The model predicts that the Over hits in 62% of simulations, and this is one of its A-rated picks for Tuesday. Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:\nWant more NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

The Cowboys' 397.4 yards per game allowed is the second-worst in the league, and they are last in the league, allowing a 52.6% third-down conversion rate. Opponents have a 112.3 passer rating against Dallas; only the Miami Dolphins allowed a better number.Williams, 27, made the Pro Bowl each of his past three seasons and was a first-team All Pro in 2022, when he racked up 12 sacks. He has just 13.5 sacks in the two and a half seasons since -- including just one this season -- but is still one of the NFL's top interior defenders. He fills one of several needs for the Cowboys.\n\n        \n            \n                Cowboys' Jerry Jones should cancel potential trade because Dallas can't contend with this defense\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith Gardner and Williams gone, the Jets (1-7) have essentially a blank slate when it comes to franchise building blocks on the defensive side of the ball. Garrett Wilson and a few young offensive linemen qualify on the offensive side of the ball, but coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey now have two first-round picks and two second-round picks in the 2026 NFL Draft and three first-round selections in 2027. Finding a quarterback and replenishing the defense will be top of mind.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The UFC has released Isaac Dulgarian following a firestorm of controversy involving suspicious betting patterns ahead of Dulgarian's loss to Yadier del Valle at this past Saturday's UFC Fight Night event, according to multiple reports. In addition to releasing Dulgarian from his contract, a UFC statement claimed the promotion's betting integrity partner, IC360, is conducting \"a thorough review of the facts\" surrounding the fight.Dulgarian was listed by sportsbooks as a solid favorite at roughly -250 to defeat del Valle as of Saturday morning. As the fight drew near, Dulgarian's moneyline dropped all the way to anywhere from nearly -170 to -130. That kind of severe line movement in such a short time indicates large amounts of money coming in, and is highly unusual.IC360 notified its clients, including UFC, on Saturday to a suspicious amount of wagers on del Valle to win in the first round, according to ESPN.Dulgarian shot for a single takedown attempt at the start of the fight and did little else before he was submitted by rear-naked choke at the 3:41 mark of the first round, cashing the aforementioned wagers on underdog del Valle to win in the first round.After the fight, some sportsbooks informed customers that they would receive credit for wagers placed on Dulgarian.\nAfter releasing Dulgarian, the UFC released a statement regarding IC360's investigation.\"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events,\" the statement read. \"Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"Darrick Minner was cut by the UFC in 2022 after losing a fight that saw similar suspicious line movement. Minner and his coach, James Krause, also received suspensions from the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Tae Hyun Bang was sentenced to 10 months in prison in South Korea after accepting a bribe to throw a 2015 fight against Leo Kuntz. Bang allegedly wagered money on Kuntz to win, though Bang ultimately won the fight by split decision.\nGambling scandals involving athletes have been put under an even brighter spotlight as of late, with NBA players and coaches among those arrested in a wide-ranging FBI probe into bettors using non-public information, such as when a player would miss a game or exit it early, to place bets, as well as illegal and rigged poker games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL trade deadline is in full swing. The latest deal to come down the wire features two teams that went toe-to-toe just a couple of days ago in the Jacksonville Jaguars and Las Vegas Raiders. After the Jags narrowly escaped Las Vegas with an overtime win in Week 9, they landed the team's top wideout, Jakobi Meyers, for a pair of draft picks.Meyers was a popular name on the trade block before the deadline, and his name has been floated around in talks for months. It dates back to the offseason when the veteran requested a trade out of Las Vegas, but that request was denied until now.For Jacksonville, it improved to 5-3 on the season with its win over the Raiders this past Sunday, staying on the heels of the AFC South-leading Indianapolis Colts (7-2). The Jags are currently slotted as the conference's No. 7 seed. With Travis Hunter currently on injured reserve, it makes sense that they targeted a pass catcher.But let's dive a bit deeper into this deal and, in the process, hand out our grades for both the Jaguars and Raiders.\nThe tradeJaguars get: Jakobi MeyersRaiders get: Fourth- and sixth-round picksJacksonville Jaguars: B-\nMeyers is a solid No. 2 option at receiver, making him a strong complement to Brian Thomas Jr. in the Jaguars' offense. As noted, Hunter is currently on injured reserve, which created a bit of a hole at the position group for Jacksonville. If/when Hunter returns after he's eligible following the next three games, it'll be interesting to see how the offense operates. It's possible for Hunter to see more time at cornerback with Meyers now in the fold, so the addition gives them flexibility.Meanwhile, the is a move that the Jags are hope to improve Trevor Lawrence's's production. The Jaguars' quarterback is 30th in completion percentage and passer rating when targeting wide receivers this season.Trevor Lawrence when targeting WRsStatsNFL RankCompletion percentage56%30thYards per attempt6.926thTD-INT5-628thPasser rating73.030thThe sticking point, at the moment, is Meyers' looming free agency. Giving up fourth- and sixth-rounders for someone who could be gone in a few months is a little rich, especially since the Jaguars have already invested quite heavily at the position.Las Vegas Raiders: B+The Raiders were going to lose Meyers one way or another. The wide receiver had requested a trade this summer, and the team decided against moving him. Then, when he was recently asked if he still had a desire to be dealt, Meyers confirmed that a trade would still be his preferred outcome.Does that sound like someone who is going to re-sign when he becomes a free agent this offseason when his contract expires? Don't think so. At 2-6, Las Vegas made the prudent move to ship off Meyers and has gained a solid return for him, considering that he's in the final year of his deal. For a rebuilding team, like the Raiders may become this offseason, bolstering the draft cupboard is critical.As for this current version of the Raiders, Meyers didn't jell with quarterback Geno Smith, who had zero touchdowns and four interceptions when targeting him this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 trade deadline in the NFL has been kicked into overdrive. While smaller deals filtered throughout Tuesday morning, the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets took it to a new level. The first blockbuster of deadline day has been agreed to with All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner being dealt from New York to Indy in exchange for two first-round picks. This is as big of an in-season trade as you'll find in NFL history and one that came out of left field. While the Jets do find themselves with one of the worst records in the NFL at 1-7 and at the bottom of the AFC East, Gardner was not on the bingo card to be dealt at the deadline. That's especially true given that the team had just inked him to a four-year, $120.4 million contract extension back in July. For the Colts, this is a home run swing as they double down on their 2025 roster that has exceeded expectations and is currently the No. 1 seed in the NFL, entering Week 10 at 7-2. \nThis is a deal that will have the NFL buzzing, but how did each club do in the blockbuster? Below, we'll hand out our grades for this mega trade between the Jets and Colts. \nThe tradeColts get: CB Sauce GardnerJets get: 2026 first-round pick, 2027 first-round pick, WR AD MitchellIndianapolis Colts: A\nAfter a 7-2 start to the season that has them slotted as the No. 1 seed in the AFC at the moment, the 2025 Colts were worth investing in, and the front office did just that with a massive swing for Gardner. Offensively, they have one of the top units in the league with Daniel Jones, Jonathan Taylor, and Tyler Warren leading the way. One of their key weaknesses, however, came on the defensive side of the ball, specifically in the secondary. There, the club ranked at the bottom of the league in some vital areas. Colts defenseStatNFL rankPassing yards per game244.826thThird down defense46%29thPassing yards per game outside the numbers152.232ndCompletion percentage on throws of 20+ air yards44%26thGardner is just the type of player who can come in and turn the tide in a more positive direction for the Colts and make them even more of a serious contender in the AFC. Not only is this a fantastic move for the 2025 Colts, but Gardner is under team control through the 2030 season. At the end of this deal, Gardner will have played through his age-30 season, meaning Indy has an All-Pro caliber corner in-house for his entire prime. Because of that team control, it makes sending those two first-rounders much more palatable. Players like Gardner do not become available quite often, so credit to Chris Ballard for pulling off one of the more stunning trades in recent deadline memory. \nNew York Jets: AAfter you get past the initial shock of moving on from a player with a name value like Gardner, the Jets came out well in this trade. In a perfect world, you're not sending a player of his caliber out the door, but New York is going nowhere fast. Not only are they 1-7 in 2025, but it feels like they are years away from truly being in contention. They've already benched Justin Fields and are going to be in the quarterback market again this offseason. Also, the jury is still out on whether first-year head coach Aaron Glenn will see Year 2. By the time they actually get to a point where they are competing, Gardner's prime may have come and gone. The front office seems to have made that determination and decided he was more valuable now as an asset, despite inking him to that massive contract extension this offseason. They get a king's ransom in return for him and are now armed with two first-round picks in each of the next two NFL Drafts. That should allow them even more flexibility to find that elusive franchise quarterback. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Last Thursday, one day before the Oct. 31 deadline, the WNBA and WNBA Players Association (WNBPA) announced they had agreed to a 30-day extension for the current CBA, giving the two groups at least 30 more days to negotiate a new deal. This takes a potential lockout off the table for now -- though according to The Athletic, both sides have the ability to terminate the extension with 48 hours notice -- and shows that the two sides can at least agree on something. It also shows that there is reason to be optimistic that the transformational deal the players are seeking is within reach. If you've been following the labor fight over the last few months, you might not share my optimism. Things have gotten ugly. The players initially opted out of this current CBA one year ago, but they turned up the heat on negotiations this summer when 40 players attended a bargaining session before the WNBA All-Star Game in Indianapolis, and felt \"disrespected\" by meeting. Ahead of the All Star game, players wore t-shirts that read, \"Pay Us What You Owe Us.\"\n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: Everything to know after two sides agree to extension\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDuring the playoffs, WNBPA vice president and Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier escalated tensions when she delivered a pre-written statement at her exit interview declaring that the WNBA had the \"worst leadership in the world.\" A couple of weeks ago, NBA commissioner Adam Silver (who oversees WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert) said in an interview with the Today Show that while WNBA players deserve a big raise, \"share\" of revenue was the wrong framework for the conversation; instead, he said the salary numbers should be fixed.\nThe WNBPA took umbrage with that characterization, and WNBPA executive director Terri Jackson issued a statement saying that \"the league's response has been to run out the clock, put lipstick on a pig and retread a system that isn't tied to any part of the business and intentionally undervalues the players.\"The crux of the dispute is over revenue sharing. The WNBA does want to give the players a significant raise -- Front Office Sports reports that the WNBA has proposed a deal with a max salary of about $850,000, up from $250,000, and a minimum salary of $300,000, up from about $80,000. But the league wants to keep the current framework in place -- a fixed salary cap that increases by a pre-determined percentage each year. In this model, revenue sharing is only triggered if certain financial targets are met. The players want a model more similar to the one in the NBA, where salary caps are directly tied to a percentage of basketball-related income. This would allow them to reap the benefits of the WNBA's growth in real time. In the NBA, players receive about 50% of basketball-related income; it's unlikely that WNBA players would be able to achieve a 50% split because operating costs are high and there isn't as much revenue to cover them as there is in the NBA. But right now WNBA salaries only account for approximately 9% of basketball-related income.\nThese are two fundamentally different ways at looking at compensation and growth, and it's undoubtedly worrisome that the two sides are still approaching negotiations in such disparate ways this late into the process. But my optimism remains, because for perhaps the first time in women's team sport history, there is enough money in the pool to make all parties happy, and enough momentum to provide motivation to make uncomfortable moves in the short term to set the stage for more riches for everyone in the long run. WNBA revenue hasn't just increased in the past few years; it has exploded. The league just signed an 11-year, $2.2 billion television deal, with supplemental broadcast deals still to come. Mark Davis bought the Las Vegas Aces for $2 million in 2021. Four years and three championships later, the Aces are valued upward of $300 million. Owners of the three most recently announced expansion teams -- Cleveland (2028), Detroit (2029) and Philadelphia (2030) -- ponied up $250 million expansion fees each. Sportico reports that the Golden State Valkyries, who just completed their inaugural season, are already worth $500 million and should make about $70 million in revenue this year. The 2025 season smashed attendance records and saw ratings soar. The business is healthy and shows no sign of slowing down.\nWomen's sports have, historically, been treated with kid gloves by investors and owners, with operating structures created to minimize losses and prioritize stability above all else. Since women's team sports are so new in the professional marketplace compared to their men's counterparts, and face layers upon layers of systemic sexism in media, advertising, fandom and business, the conservative approach was somewhat understandable. But when you let the worst-case scenario dictate every decision, you put a cap on the best-case scenario. It's a testament to the players that the league has grown as much as it has despite this limiting governance. With this next CBA, players are asking the league to take the training wheels off. It's going to take a mindset shift from owners and, most likely, some compromises from the players to help grease the wheels. But there is too much money to be made by all parties for good sense not to prevail. The WNBA is no longer in survival mode, and it's time for a CBA that reflects that. Hopefully by Nov. 30 that will be a reality.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Injuries from last Sunday will have a big impact on Week 10 Fantasy football lineups with Tucker Kraft (knee) out for the season, Jayden Daniels (elbow) out indefinitely, and the likes of Puka Nacua (ribs), C.J. Stroud (concussion) and Aaron Jones (shoulder) being day-to-day. The ailments to Kraft and Daniels will undoubtedly have a ripple effect for the likes of Jordan Love, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Deebo Samuel and Zach Ertz. Fortunately, lots of star players are coming off byes, but with everything going on, that only creates more of a need to seek out Week 10 Fantasy football advice.Among those returning to action off a bye are Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Breece Hall and Emeka Egbuka. However, star-studded teams like the Cowboys and Chiefs are going on a bye this week, and combined with the injuries, you could be looking at several Fantasy football start/sit decisions.

Despite that, he may not warrant a spot in Week 10 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 30 in WR rankings. Diggs has salvaged his Fantasy value over the last two weeks with a touchdown in each game, but he had only 52 total yards and three catches in each. Over his last four games, the veteran is averaging just 37.3 receiving yards, and for the season, Diggs has only two games with at least 70 yards.The Patriots are seeing their younger receivers, namely Pop Douglas and Kayshon Boutte, emerge as each player has more touchdown catches than Diggs' pair on the season. Additionally, Diggs doesn't have the best Week 10 matchup versus Tampa, which has done a good job at keeping receivers out of the endzone. Over the last 14 touchdowns scored against the Bucs, just three of them have come via wideouts, as Diggs is a player to fade this week.Another curveball: The model is high on Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart. The rookie has rushing touchdowns in each of his last four games and also has a 7:1 TD:INT over that stretch. Dart's legs are one of his biggest Fantasy assets as only Jayden Daniels is averaging more rushing yards per start, amongst quarterbacks, and only Josh Allen has more rushing touchdowns at the position.On Sunday, he gets to face one of the most Fantasy-friendly defenses to running quarterbacks as just six teams allow more rushing yards per game to QBs than the Bears. Chicago was also shredded thru the air by Joe Flacco on Sunday, to the tune of 470 passing yards and four touchdowns. With Chicago having the No. 29 scoring defense and ranking 25th versus the pass, Dart finds himself in the top 10 of positional rankings.

    "body": "\n        The Indianapolis Colts have made what will go down as the most surprising trade of the 2025 NFL trade deadline. The Colts have acquired star cornerback Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets in exchange for two first-round picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones.According to CBS Sports Research, Gardner is the sixth player to be traded in-season for multiple first-round picks in the last 40 years. Believe it or not, the Cots were involved in half of these six trades, as they acquired running back Eric Dickerson from the Los Angeles Rams for multiple first-round picks in 1987, and linebacker Fredd Young from the Seattle Seahawks the following season. Jones reports that the Jets were not actively shopping their No. 1 cornerback, but the return from Indy was too good for the front office to pass up. Gardner appeared to confirm the news himself, posting on social media, \"New York it's been real.\"\nColts general manager Chris Ballard issued a statement following the blockbuster trade, saying that Gardner is going to elevate the Colts defense as a whole.\n\"Having the opportunity to acquire a talented player like Sauce Gardner was one we did not want to pass on. He was a player that we scouted heavily coming out of college and there's a reason he was the fourth overall pick. Sauce is a proven cornerback. His skill and competitive nature will elevate everyone's play on the defensive unit. We're thrilled he's a Colt. On the same note, AD Mitchell is a great person and a great player. We believe he will have success in New York, and we wish him the best as he enters the next chapter of his career.\"Just four months ago, the Jets made Gardner the highest-paid cornerback in NFL history, as he signed a four-year, $120.4 million extension that averages $30.1 million per year with the franchise that selected him with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Now, the 25-year superstar is embracing a change of scenery.Two first-round picks is quite an expensive price to pay, but it shows how much the Colts value a young, legitimate CB1, and how serious they are about winning now. Gardner earned Defensive Rookie of the Year honors after recording 75 combined tackles, two interceptions and a league-leading 20 passes defensed in his first NFL season. He became the first rookie cornerback to ever be named a First Team All-Pro, and earned a trip to the Pro Bowl as well. In seven games played this season, Gardner recorded 20 combined tackles and six passes defensed. He allowed 7.2 yards per attempt in coverage over the last two seasons after allowing 4.6 yards per attempt in his first two seasons, and has registered the lowest completion percentage allowed (46%) since entering the league. Gardner has three career interceptions, but picked off just one pass in his last 46 games. Gardner joins a secondary that allows 244.8 passing yards per game, which ranks seventh-worst in the NFL through nine weeks. The Colts rank 29th in third-down defense (46%), 26th in completion percentage allowed on throws of 20+ air yards (44%) and last in passing yards per game outside the numbers (152.2).\nAs for the Jets' new wideout, Mitchell caught nine passes for 152 yards this season for the Colts after recording 23 receptions for 312 yards as a rookie in 2024. He infamously fumbled a walk-in touchdown against the Rams in Week 4 while celebrating early. The No. 52 overall pick played his college football at Texas after transferring in from Georgia, and earned the 2023 Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year after leading the conference in receiving touchdowns with 11.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LSU's search for a football coach continues to draw national attention and one of the school's most famous faces isn't staying quiet. Shaquille O'Neal, the four-time NBA champion and Basketball Hall of Famer who played for the Tigers from 1989 to 1992, said he heard LSU may be in talks with former coach Nick Saban about a return to Baton Rouge.\"I heard through the grapevine that they were having conversations with Nick Saban,\" O'Neal told Us Weekly. \"That'd be awesome if we can bring Nick back.\"Saban, 74, led LSU from 2000-04, capturing a national championship before departing for the NFL. He returned to college football in 2007 at Alabama, building one of the most dominant dynasties with six more national titles before retiring in 2023. This past weekend on ESPN's College GameDay, Saban addressed speculation of a potential return to coaching and emphasized that tradition alone does not guarantee success in modern college football.\"You've got all these external factors that are constantly changing,\" Saban said. \"Whether it's the transfer portal, how much you can pay guys, revenue sharing, what kind of collective do you have? So, traditionally, how have you been able to adapt to that? ... Some of the traditional jobs, like LSU, that people always looked at as one of the best jobs, have they adapted to all these things like they need to to continue to be one of the best jobs in the country?\"\nSaban later clarified that he has no plans to return to coaching.For O'Neal, the focus remains on patience and optimism for LSU's next hire. \"We're just gonna sit and see who they choose,\" he said. \"I know it will definitely be a winner and I know it'll be somebody that's in line with our culture. I know it's somebody who's going to bring us back to winning. We realize if you lose more than two games, we don't get a significant bowl game.\"\nLSU fired Brian Kelly Oct. 26 after a 5-3 start in his fourth season. Kelly finished 34-14, with a single SEC Championship Game appearance, but was unable to get the Tigers to the College Football Playoff to contend for a national title. The decision led to the resignation of athletic director Scott Woodward, who had fallen out of favor with LSU stakeholders, including Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the second time in two months, the Atlanta Falcons have waived their starting kicker. The latest move came on Tuesday when the team decided to move on from John Parker Romo and replace him with Zane Gonzalez, according to NFL Media. Parker Romo had been the team's kicker since Week 2, but the Falcons lost confidence in him on Sunday after he missed a key kick against the Patriots. During Atlanta's 24-23 loss to New England, Parker Romo missed an extra point that would have tied the game at 24 with just 4:40 left to play in the fourth quarter. Following the loss, Falcons coach Raheem Morris made it clear that he wasn't going to make any rash decisions about his kicker, but he was also noncommittal about Parker Romo's future in Atlanta. \"Everything is always going to be talked about, but I don't make emotional decisions,\" Morris said Sunday. \"Those things happen. We have to go back and look at the tape, see what went wrong.\"\nWith Gonzalez expected to kick on Sunday in Germany against the Colts, that means that the Falcons are now on their third kicker of the season. Younghoe Koo started the year as the kicker, but the team lost all confidence in him after he missed a 44-yard field goal in Week 1 with just six seconds left to play in a 23-20 loss to the Buccaneers. \nKoo had been the Falcons kicker since 2019, but he was on thin ice heading into the 2025 season after hitting just 73.5% of his kicks in 2024. \nAfter Koo's miss, the Falcons brought in Parker Romo and he ended up being beating out Koo for the starting spot. Parker Romo took over the kicking job in Week 2 and he got off to a hot start by hitting 5 of 5 field goals in a 22-6 win over the Minnesota Vikings. However, Parker Romo has hit just 66.7% of his field goals (6 of 9) since that perfect game, which is likely one big reason why the Falcons were willing to move on following his missed extra point against the Patriots. The Falcons will now be handing their kicking job over to Gonzalez, who has only kicked in six games over the past three years. He's been in the NFL since 2017, but he didn't kick in a single regular-season game in either 2022 or 2023. In 2024, he spent six games with the Commanders during a stint where he hit just 71.4% of his field goals, so he might not be a huge upgrade over Parker Romo. If the Falcons don't feel like Gonzalez is the answer, they could call Justin Tucker. The former Ravens kicker will be eligible to return next week after serving a 10-game suspension to start the season. \n            ",

    "body": "\nFour of the five teams we had rated at least five points better than average lost last week as underdogs struck back following two weeks of favorite domination. The Chiefs, our clear top team heading into the week, had trouble handling a Bills defense that has looked inconsistent this season, but Buffalo came in with a great plan to get pressure on Patrick Mahomes, which led to a disappointing day for the Kansas City offense.We still have the Chiefs ranked No. 1, but the Bills shoot to No. 2 with the defense seeming to get a boost from returning players, including Maxwell Hairston. After missing the first six games of the season, the rookie recorded the only interception of Mahomes in just his second career appearance while making several other quality plays and limiting speedster Xavier Worthy (who the Bills passed on drafting the previous year) to just three catches and 23 yards. Cole Bishop also came up big for a unit desperate for something positive from the safety position, and if those two young players can solidify the back end the rest of the way, the Bills should move from the defense being a major problem to a unit that could help the team collect wins in January.The Rams have an argument to be the best team in the NFC after a third straight easy win. They'll get the chance to avenge their latest loss in a matchup this week with the 49ers, who continue to be one of the least healthy teams in the league with another member of the defensive line lost for the season in Mykel Williams. However, the 49ers showed with more limited offensive weapons in the first meeting that they can hang with the Rams, so I'm surprised that the line is above 3. Everything about this yearly battle between Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay tells me there's always value taking the hook if it's available, and we get to do it with the home team here.\nI'll have several more spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and highlight a few more teams of note.Week 10 power ratingsTeam109876KC77.56.55.54BUF64.54.54.56.5DET5.5664.55.5BAL5500-5SEA54.54.532LAR54.54.534GB55454IND4.554.52.53PHI4.54.53.534NE2.52.5211LAC1.52122DEN10123TB11132PIT00110ATL0-1010HOU00-100SF0-10-1.50MIN-1-1.5-1-1-1ARI-1-1-1.5-1.5-1.5CHI-1-1.5-1-1.5-1.5JAC-1.5-1-1.500DAL-1.5-11-1.5-1.5WAS-3.5-102.53NYG-3.5-3.5-2-3-5LV-3.5-3.5-4.5-4-4CAR-3.5-4.5-3.5-4-4.5CIN-5-4.5-4.5-5.5-5MIA-5-4.5-5-4.5-4.5CLE-5.5-5.5-5-5-4.5NO-6-5.5-4.5-4-4.5NYJ-6-6-6-6.5-6TEN-8   -8-7-6.5-6I'm giving the Lions a little bit of a pass by keeping them as the top NFC team in the power ratings following an ugly loss to the Vikings. Their run game was surprisingly pedestrian, and I wonder if the interior offensive line, which I had questions about coming into the season, ends up being their Achilles heel. But if you made them a pick 'em on a neutral field against the other top NFC teams, I'd still lean their way.That includes the Seahawks, a team that looks elite at many things but terrible at running the ball. While they were able to beat the elite defense they just faced in the Texans, that was more a product of Houston not being able to do anything offensively as Seattle turned the ball over four times, including two interceptions and a lost fumble by Sam Darnold. The true test for them is going to come in their two games against the Rams, who have the passing defense to give Darnold problems and the offense to score points on the Seahawks. If they can at least split those games, I'll feel better about the team heading into the playoffs.The Chargers rank first in yards differential on the season, gaining 87.8 more per game than they surrender, but I wonder if the latest blow to the offensive line will ultimately be the nail in the coffin as none of the remaining tackles inspire a lot of confidence. Maybe Justin Herbert can continue to play well enough to make it work, and I have enough hope that I'm willing to keep the Chargers slightly ahead of the Broncos, but the Steelers defense could provide an immediate test at their breaking point this week.While Marcus Mariota has done a fine job filling in for Jayden Daniels when called upon, I don't have much hope for the Commanders with how poorly the defense has played. Washington ranks last in the league in passing yards per play allowed by a significant margin after Darnold carved them up on national TV Sunday night. Only the Saints and Giants have more losses in the NFC, so it feels like Washington is cooked. Considering the high expectations coming into the season, we'll see how competitive the Commanders play down the stretch facing that reality.Full Week 10 projected linesAwayHomeLookaheadConsensusPR SpreadNotesLVDEN-10.5-9-7LV gassed after OT loss?ATLIND-7-5.5-4.5In BerlinBALMIN+3.5+4+4BUFMIA+8.5+9.5+7.5CLENYJ-1.5-2-1.5JACHOU-3-1.5-3PR line assumes Stroud inNYGCHI-3-3.5-5NETB-2.5-2.5+0.5Surprised market is fading NENOCAR-3.5-5.5-4.5ARISEA-6.5-6.5-7DETWAS+3.5+8.5+7LARSF+3+3.5+2.5Purdy, Pearsall could returnPITLAC-4.5-3-2.5PHI   GB   -3   -2.5   -2.5   This is how I would set each game based on my power ratings and home field advantage data for this week.

    "body": "\n        Now in his 11th NBA season, Suns superstar Devin Booker is well-established as one of the league's best scorers, but he's also evolved into a more capable distributor over the years, and he isn't afraid to crash the glass from time-to-time as a bigger guard. Booker has averaged at least 4.0 rebounds per game for the last eight years, and he's averaging 4.0 again in 2025-26 through seven games. However, you can still find Booker's over/under for total rebounds for as low as 3.5 and with a plus-money payout for a Tuesday night matchup against the Warriors in the latest NBA odds.

His over rate on the road, 57.5% is actually higher than his rate at home (54.8%), and other guards who average between 3.5 and 4.5 rebounds do go over this line at a higher rate at Golden State (46.8%) than at home vs Golden State (42.2%),\" SportsLine senior data analyst Stephen Oh said. \"We are getting a little better line because without KD or Beal on the team anymore Booker has to both score a ton and play point guard, but his rebounding average is basically unchanged from a year ago because his minutes will be 36+.\" Bet on Booker with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins and three months free NBA League Pass:Nikola Vucevic, Bulls, Over 3.5 assists (+108)\"He is projected for 3.7 and has averaged 3.5 since last season, so we'll stick with the strategy of taking +$$$ on a line at or below both his average and projection. The over/under trends do not support us as he is only 32-48 over this line since last season, but recently he's shown some big assist numbers (9 on 10/27 and 7 on 10/29),\" Oh said. \"Since last February, Josh Giddey has become super aggressive on offense, and once he became a high-end scorer, Vucevic's assists has increased from 3.43 to 3.69 and his over rate went from 18-30, 37.5% to 14-18, 43.8%.\"Bet on Vucevic and get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins along with three months of free NBA League Pass:Jakob Poeltl, Raptors, Over 16.5 points + rebounds (-102)\"He practiced on Monday and appears to be ready to go tonight. The Bucks are on a road trip back-to-back, were outrebounded by the Pacers last night, and allowed Indiana to shoot 57% from 2pt range. I like the situation here for Poeltl. I figure the worst case scenario is the bet is nullified if he doesn't play,\" Oh said. His average since last season is 24 points + rebounds so this line is assuming he may play reduced minutes. The over 16.5 is hitting at a whopping 82% (50-11), but if you isolate his games where he played a reduced 22 to 26 minutes, he still averaged 20.7 with a 9-5 over trend. He only had 11 PTS+REB in their 10/24 matchup vs Milwaukee, but before that he had been 3-0 over this line.\"Bet on Poeltl with Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBS20X, which gives new users 20 100% profit boosts after their first $1 wager.Want more Tuesday NBA picks?You've seen the model's NBA picks for some popular NBA player props for Tuesday.

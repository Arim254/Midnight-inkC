This week, they look to do much more, and once again, they'll have to do it against a tough opponent. The Broncos host the Jacksonville Jaguars, who look to make some playoff noise of their own, in a battle of two of the hottest teams in the NFL.Plenty is on the line beyond Denver's 11-game winning streak and Jacksonville's five consecutive wins. With a win, the Broncos can clinch the No. 1 seed, which guarantees homefield advantage and a first-round bye. Jacksonville, meanwhile, can clinch a playoff spot with any of the following scenarios:Jaguars win + Indianapolis Colts loss or tieJaguars win + Houston Texans loss or tieJaguars tie + Colts lossJaguars tie + Colts tie + Texans lossDenver's 11-game winning streak is the longest in the league, and the Broncos' most recent win was its most impressive: a 34-26 comeback victory over the Green Bay Packers. Bo Nix threw four touchdown passes, and the vaunted Broncos defense came to life in the second half, picking off Jordan Love twice and sacking him three times. Denver improved to 10-2 in one-score games, and Nix's clutch gene has been on display all season.\nThe Jaguars cruised past the New York Jets, 48-20, with a dominant performance by Trevor Lawrence: 330 passing yards, five passing touchdowns, 51 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown. He did not take a sack or have a turnover, and he has been playing the best football of his career during Jacksonville's five-game winning streak.\n        \n            \n                Trevor Lawrence playing the best football of his career as Jaguars quietly grow into dark horse contender\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere's how to watch this critical AFC showdown, followed by betting information, keys to the game and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Broncos vs. Jaguars liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 21 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoTV: Fox | Stream:  Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -3, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Broncos vs. Jaguars: Need to knowBoth quarterbacks are playing well, but face tough tests. Lawrence is arguably the NFL's best quarterback over the past five weeks, leading the league in yards per attempt (8.6) and touchdown passes (13) over that span. But Denver brings arguably the best defense in the NFL, led by reigning Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain II (who reeled in his first interception of the season last week) and a ferocious pass rush. Denver's 58 sacks through 13 games are the most by any team since the 2000 Saints. Nix, meanwhile, has an NFL-best six game-winning drives. He faces a Jaguars defense that's 10th in yards per game allowed and has the league's fourth-highest interception rate.Can either running game get going? These are two of the best run defenses in the NFL, so the answer to that question is likely \"no.\" Since the start of November, the Jaguars rank 27th in yards per carry, and the Broncos are 29th. Still, lead running backs Travis Etienne Jr. and RJ Harvey are finding ways to contribute. Etienne has 12 touchdowns this season -- including three through the air last week. Harvey has 10 touchdowns, including one last week.Can Jaguars' pass rush disrupt Nix? Nix has just a 3.1% sack rate this season, the lowest in the NFL. His offensive line has been outstanding, and he has done a great job extending plays. But the Jaguars have some talented pass rushers in Josh Hines-Allen (seven sacks), Travon Walker and Dennis Gardeck.Broncos vs. Jaguars pick, prediction\nLawrence has been on fire lately, but his best performances have come against poor defenses. Denver's defense is arguably the league's best. The Broncos have won 12 straight at home and are increasingly looking like the AFC's best team. They continue that trend on Sunday.

Two of the worst teams in the league will meet in New Orleans, but the Saints seem to have found some life late in the season.The Saints have strung together back-to-back wins, and they've come against division rivals fighting for first place in the NFC South. Compared to that, this meeting with the Jets looks like a cakewalk. That's especially true when you consider how well rookie Tyler Shough has been playing. After losing out on the starting role in training camp, Shough has come a long way and looks like the quarterback of the future in New Orleans. Defensively, the Saints have limited opponents to 24 points or fewer in their last five matchups.If the Saints have started to gain some traction, the Jets have been spinning their wheels while sliding in the wrong direction. In each of the last two weeks, New York has gotten crushed, losing those games by a combined 52 points. The Jets have recently turned to a rookie quarterback of their own with third-stringer Brady Cook taking over for the injured Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields. Cook tossed three interceptions in a 48-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars and will need a major bounce back to notch his first career win in the Superdome.Here is everything you need to know about this AFC vs. NFC matchup.\nWhere to watch Jets vs. Saints liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 21 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Caesars Superdome -- New Orleans, LouisianaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Saints -5.5, O/U 40.5 (via DraftKings)Jets vs. Saints: Need to knowDefensive changes in New York: The Jets' performance against the Jaguars was so bad that it cost defensive coordinator Steve Wilks his job. New York allowed 330 passing yards and 108 rushing yards as it got torched for 48 points. The Saints offense may not present the same level of challenge, but interim coordinator Chris Harris will still have his hands full trying to organize what has been a mess of a defense for most of the season.Shough showing promise: It wasn't the easiest transition to the NFL for Shough -- he struggled enough in camp that Spencer Rattler won the starting job. That said, he has shown signs of legitimate improvement lately. Shough is the first rookie quarterback in team history to win back-to-back starts, and another victory would give him four, surpassing Archie Manning's franchise record for rookie wins.Rookie QB battle: We have another rookie quarterback matchup on our hands this week, but this one is on the older end of the spectrum. This is just the seventh clash of rookie quarterbacks aged 24 or older since 1950. All of the previous six have come since 2002. Shough appears to have the clear upper hand in this showdown, but maybe Cook and the Jets can pull out a surprise in The Big Easy.Jets vs. Saints prediction, pick\nTo say that the Jets are a mess these days would be an understatement. They're down to their third-string quarterback, their star wide receiver is hurt and the defense is a disaster. I don't love the idea of taking the Saints to cover 5.5 points, but would anyone be surprised to see New Orleans win by a touchdown based upon how the two teams have played lately?

The 2025 college football season was filled with drama and intense conference championship races, but now it's time to find out who the best in the nation truly is. Indiana's enters this year's playoff as the No. 1 seed on the heels of a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. Despite the loss, however, the Buckeyes did not fall very far from the top spot they previously held, as Ryan Day's team came in at No. 2. SEC champion Georgia enters as the third seed, while Big 12 champion Texas Tech rounds out the top of the field as the No. 4 seed. Those teams all earned first-round byes, but we have some tantalizing matchups coming in the first round. The playoff opens with four first-round games on Friday and Saturday before advancing to the quarterfinals at some of college football's most iconic bowl venues. Quarterfinal winners will move on to the semifinals Jan. 8 and 9, leading up to the College Football Playoff National Championship Monday, Jan. 20, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports Graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama at (8) Oklahoma: 8 p.m. | ABC/ESPNGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner: Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner: 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner: 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

In his first year as a full-time starter, he completed 61.8% of his passes for 2,932 yards and 25 touchdowns with 10 interceptions. Reed is also Texas A&M's second-leading rusher with 466 yards and six touchdowns on 89 carries, making him a dual-threat quarterback who can impact the game both through the air and on the ground.KC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&M: The Aggies' offense is loaded with weapons, and Concepcion has quickly emerged as the top target. The transfer from NC State made an immediate impact in his first season in College Station, tying for an SEC-leading nine touchdown catches while totaling 886 receiving yards. His counterpart Mario Craver complements him well, adding 825 yards and four touchdowns on the season, giving Texas A&M a dynamic duo that can stretch defenses.Cashius Howell, DL, Texas A&M: A CBS Sports' first-team All-America selection, Howell finds himself in elite company as the first Aggies' defender to post 11.5 sacks in a season since Myles Garrett in 2014. He led the SEC in that category in 2025.\nCarson Beck, QB, Miami: Beck has been somewhat unstoppable recently, topping Power Four quarterbacks since Week 11 with 12 touchdown passes while completing nearly 80% of his throws. Miami's strong season has leaned heavily on his steady decision-making -- the Hurricanes are 8-0 when he limits interceptions to fewer than two, but slip to 1-2 when he tosses multiple interceptions.Malachi Toney, WR, Miami: Few newcomers to college football made a louder first impression than Toney did this season. Once an under-the-radar three-star recruit, he quickly became central to Miami's offense, stacking 84 receptions -- the sixth-most in the nation -- and leading the ACC with seven receiving touchdowns. His impact extended well beyond the passing game, as his speed translates to gadget runs and special teams duties.Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami: The ACC Defensive Player of the Year, Bain is a projected first-round pick for the 2026 NFL Draft. He has 37 total tackles, including 7.5 for loss with 4.5 sacks, an interception and a forced fumble this season.\nMiami vs. Texas A&M prediction, pick\nThis really does feel like a coin-flip game, but Miami has enough subtle edges to make a strong case for the road upset. Both teams boast elite pass-protecting offensive lines and disruptive defensive fronts capable of affecting the quarterback, so clean execution will matter most. There's understandable concern about Carson Beck's history with turnovers in a hostile environment, yet Texas A&M hasn't consistently capitalized on those mistakes, with the second-fewest interceptions forced (3) this season in the FBS. If Miami protects the football -- something it has done well in big moments -- the Hurricanes' ability to create takeaways and manufacture explosive plays could be the deciding factor. Pick: Miami +3.5\n            ",

The latter will be the case in the contest between the Arizona Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons, both of whom are hoping to find some success amid disappointing seasons. While a five-game losing streak essentially crushed their playoff hopes, the Falcons showed considerable resolve during last week's come-from-behind victory over the Buccaneers that included three unanswered scores during the game's final 10 minutes. In the win, Atlanta racked up a season-high 476 yards that included 373 yards and three touchdowns from veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins. Like the Falcons, the Cardinals also fell victim to a brutal losing streak. The difference is that the Cardinals' losing streak has lasted virtually the entire season after their 2-0 start. Since their 2-0 start, the Cardinals have won just one game and are entering Sunday's game on a six-game losing streak. \nWhere to watch Falcons vs. Cardinals liveWhen: Sunday, Dec. 21 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETWhere: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Arizona  TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Falcons -3, O/U 48.5 (via DraftKings)Falcons vs. Cardinals: Need to know You like that! Last week was easily Cousins' best game of the season since he replaced the injured Michael Penix Jr. In addition to throwing three touchdowns, Cousins completed an impressive 68.2% of his passes (which is more impressive when you consider that he had 44 attempts) while not throwing an interception. He was only sacked once, which is a testament to the Falcons' offensive line. Life is good in the Pitts. Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts is coming off his monster performance against the Buccaneers that included 166 yards and three touchdowns on 11 receptions (and 12 targets). Pitts' 166 yards and three touchdown catches are single-season highs for any NFL tight end. Lucky No. 7. The NFL has several elite backs, including the Eagles' Saquon Barkley, the Ravens' Derrick Henry, the Colts' Jonathan Taylor, the Bills' James Cook and the 49ers' Christian McCaffrey. The Falcons have one of those elite backs in Bijan Robinson, who might be having the best season of any NFL running back. Through 14 games, Robinson is fourth in the NFL in rushing and is second among all running backs with 684 receiving yards. He is just 142 yards away from becoming the third player in franchise history to eclipse 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a single season. History-making TE. Arizona's Trey McBride recently made history by becoming the first tight end in NFL history to catch 100 passes in consecutive seasons. McBride currently leads the NFL with 105 catches. Improved pass rush. Atlanta aggressively went about improving its pass rush this past offseason, selecting both James Pearce and Jalon Walker in the first round. Both players have played well this year while helping the Falcons rank second in the NFL with 48 sacks. Brissett lighting it up. While it hasn't led to many wins, Cardinals quarterback Jacoby Brissett has been piling up impressive numbers while playing in relief of Kyler Murray. The 10-year veteran has attempted at least 40 passes in each of Arizona's last six games. In Week 11, he went 47 of 57 passing while setting the NFL single game record for completions. Falcons vs. Cardinals prediction, pick \nWhile Brissett and McBride give the Cardinals' a puncher's chance, the Falcons' offensive firepower should result in the Falcons winning consecutive games for only the second time this season, especially if Drake London returns after missing the last four games with a knee injury. Pick: Falcons -3, Over 48.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        There was a time when a coach doing double duty in pursuit of a national championship was rare. There were times it worked well (Kirby Smart staying with Alabama on its 2015 title run) and times it didn't (Lane Kiffin struggling to balance Alabama OC role with Florida Atlantic job), but it was treated as a particularly arduous challenge that should only be accepted in unique circumstances.Now, everywhere you look in this year's 12-team College Football Playoff field you'll see a coach attempting to do two jobs at the same time.There are the Group of Five head coaches in Tulane's Jon Sumrall and James Madison's Bob Chesney who are putting together new staffs and teams at Florida and UCLA, respectively, while hoping to go on one last run.\nTwo programs, Texas A&M and Oregon, have both coordinators doing double duty through the playoff. Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein took the Kentucky job while defensive coordinator Tosh Lupoi has stayed on the West Coast as Cal's new head coach. Texas A&M defensive coordinator Jay Bateman will join Stein in Kentucky full-time once the Aggies' season is over. Texas A&M OC Collin Klein is balancing his new duties as Kansas State's head coach. Ohio State offensive coordinator Brian Hartline is South Florida's new coach. Oregon State hired JaMarcus Shephard and will get 100 percent of his attention once Alabama's season wraps up.And then, of course, there is what happened at Ole Miss. The Rebels famously would not let Lane Kiffin do both after he made clear his intentions to accept the LSU job. Instead, defensive coordinator Pete Golding was promoted and will make his head coaching debut in the playoff. No pressure.\nEvery single first-round game has been impacted in some way by a coach trying to manage two jobs at the same time. The only two schools not affected are No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 10 Miami. What will it all mean? It's the biggest question of this first slate of playoff games. Will the impact be felt most by play-callers now balancing head coaching responsibilities for the first time? By head coaches who already have one foot out the door for a bigger job? Or by the mishmash of Ole Miss assistants, some of whom -- including offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. -- will follow Lane Kiffin to Baton Rouge at the conclusion of the season.\n        \n            \n                College Football Top 150 Players of 2025: The names that defined the season\n                \n                    Blake Brockermeyer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCan the Cinderellas deliver?There is an extraordinary opportunity this weekend for the Group of Five. The smaller schools get two David vs. Goliath opportunities that could change the narrative that they don't belong in the College Football Playoff. That is especially timely as playoff expansion discussions continue to heat up ahead of a January deadline. \nConversely, two blowout losses for Tulane (at Ole Miss) and James Madison (at Oregon) provide even more ammunition for a growing group of critics. In recent weeks, a host of prominent college football personalities, including former Alabama head coach Nick Saban, have openly questioned whether Group of Five teams should be included in the field. Two non-Power Four teams making this year's field has seemingly kicked up a hornet's nest. Tulane is the better bet to keep it close, but that's not saying much given the Green Wave already played Ole Miss this season and lost 45-10. Tulane is a 17.5-point underdog and will need all the change over at Ole Miss to play in its favor. James Madison is an even bigger underdog at 21 points against the Ducks. The Dukes are a wonderful story, edging out Duke as the fifth-best conference champion, but they face a massive test on the road in Eugene. Oregon should have way too much talent for JMU to hang around Saturday night. \nIt's not fair to Tulane and JMU, but small schools everywhere need them to put on a good show on Saturday. Pressure on DeBoerI would listen to arguments for Ole Miss' Pete Golding and Miami's Mario Cristobal, but Kalen DeBoer sticks out to me as the head coach with the most riding on this weekend's results.It's been a wild rollercoaster ride of the first two years for DeBoer as Nick Saban's replacement. There have been high highs like the wins over Georgia and the 4-0 October record this season. There have been low lows like the season-opening loss to Florida State and back-to-back losses to the Oklahoma Sooners. And, in recent weeks, there have been reports of Penn State and Michigan interest in DeBoer, though the Alabama coach has done his best to tamp down the speculation. \nAlabama eked into the playoff, but could be staring at three losses to Oklahoma in two seasons if the Tide can't emerge with a road win in Norman. Oklahoma coach Brent Venables has been DeBoer's kryptonite so far.  A loss Friday night would give DeBoer a 19-8 record, one playoff appearance and a bad loss in his lone SEC Championship game. That's not a disaster by any means, but it isn't exactly meeting the standard Saban set during his 17 seasons in Tuscaloosa. Making matters worse, Alabama comes limping into this game after that blowout 28-7 loss to Georgia in Atlanta. The running game has been nonexistent pretty much all season. Ty Simpson, who was a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidate at one point, hasn't looked like himself in recent games. The defense will again be without LT Overton. Alabama is a 1.5-point underdog against Oklahoma, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. Losing to a solid SEC team on the road shouldn't be a reason to freak out, but it would leave a bad taste in Tide fans' mouths for the second consecutive offseason headed into a critical Year 3. Unless it's the title game, one game shouldn't make or break how you perceive a season. But Friday night's result could have a big impact on shaping the discussion around DeBoer and his Alabama program headed into 2026. \nSALTY TALTYEach week, this space will be my airing of grievances, my opportunity to let the audience know what has been really grinding my gears. Hopefully, it'll be mostly college football-related, but it's a good bet travel, family and other day-to-day life annoyances will find a way in. In many ways, Frank Costanza is the spirit animal of this segment. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, he is a character, played by Jerry Stiller, on the iconic comedy \"Seinfeld.\" And, in one of my favorite episodes, he comes up with a holiday called \"Festivus,\" a holiday for the rest of us where each of us has an opportunity to air our grievances. In honor of Mr. Costanza and Festivus (celebrated on Dec. 23rd), here are some of my final grievances for this college football season because I've got A LOT of problems with you people. \nTo the leaders of the sport: FIGURE. IT. OUT. Eject the bad actors and understand what actually makes college football unique. Trying to become a mini-NFL isn't the way. Evolution and adaptation are crucial and should be commended, but don't lose the soul of the sport along the way. For once, try to consider what would make the sport healthier and not simply what would line your pockets with the most cash. To recruits and players considering transferring: Please stop making your announcements on major national holidays. There can be exceptions, sure, but there are few things more frustrating as a reporter than having to tell your family at a Christmas or Fourth of July party you need to step away because a three-star just committed. There are 354 days a year that aren't federal holidays -- ample opportunity to use the Notes app to announce your big decision that won't lead to everyone in your favorite reporter's family mad at another holiday ruined because of work. To the football gatekeepers: If you only want to be a fan of major brands, that's great. If you want to watch every Group of 5 and FCS game, that's great, too. But I'm sick of the clash of who gets to comment on college football and who doesn't. College football is one big tent that has plenty of room for the most ardent ball-knowers and those who are just starting to pay attention now that it is playoff time. It's what makes the sport great and should be embraced, rather than turning everything into a contest on who is allowed to like the sport. \nTo Diego Pavia: You don't have to follow every step of Johnny Manziel's path. I understand the kinship between two of the most electrifying and polarizing SEC quarterbacks ever, but Pavia has lost a lot of goodwill with his recent antics. Learn from Manziel's mistakes and stop antagonizing everyone who may have otherwise liked you. The reaction to the Heisman Trophy going to Fernando Mendoza was childish and embarrassing from the 23-year old. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Pirates, Houston Astros, and Tampa Bay Rays agreed to a three-team, six-player trade on Friday involving, among others, All-Star second baseman Brandon Lowe. While Lowe heads to Pittsburgh, the Astros gain a starting pitcher and the Rays take in two promising young talents.As is always the case at CBS Sports when a notable MLB trade happens, I'm here to break it down from all angles. Below, you'll find analysis on every player in this swap, as well as commentary on their fits. You'll also find letter grades summarizing my thoughts on the deal. Those are the least important part of this process, even if they tend to receive the most attention. Before we get to that, here is the deal in its entirety: Pirates receive: 2B Brandon Lowe, LHP Mason Montgomery, OF Jake MangumAstros receive: RHP Mike BurrowsRays receive: OF Jacob Melton, RHP Anderson BritoNow, let's conduct some business.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pirates grade: BThe Pirates had a clear objective entering the offseason: upgrade one of the majors' worst lineups so that they can compete for the franchise's first playoff berth since 2015. Pittsburgh's lineup ranked last in home runs and runs scored, and only two Pirates, regardless of sample size, finished with an above-average wRC+ (FanGraphs' park-adjusted offensive metric). That's why you've seen them connected to everyone, from stars Kyle Schwarber and Ketel Marte to non-stars Luis Robert Jr. and Willi Castro. When the bar is this low, a team almost has to try to not find improvements.The Pirates may have landed one such improvement earlier this winter, nabbing outfielder Jhostynxon Garcia from the Red Sox. Here, they've grabbed a bigger one. Lowe, 31, isn't on the level of a Schwarber or a Marte. He's not a transformative talent despite being named to two All-Star Games in his career. Thankfully, he doesn't have to be in order to provide the Pirates with more offense than the Nick Gonzales-Adam Frazier connection did in 2025. \nLowe has been at least a league-average producer in all of his big-league seasons, even in those years where he was compromised by injury. To an extent, he fits the blueprint for the modern overachieving slugger. He's a free-swinger who will expand and chase, but he's adept at lofting the ball hard, particularly in the air and to his pull side -- he hasn't averaged more than 30 home runs per 162 games for his career by accident. There are some downsides to Lowe's game and fit to be aware of if you're the Pirates. He's not nearly as effective against lefties, and his defense at the keystone has fallen off in recent years. (He has experience in the outfield, but he hasn't played an inning out there in three seasons.) PNC Park is also a tough slugging environment for lefty bats. Statcast suggests Lowe would have 22 fewer career home runs if he had played all his games there. Some would-be home runs will turn into doubles, others outs. On the bright side, Lowe will probably feast on road trips to Cincinnati and Milwaukee.\nThe other potential negative with Lowe is the opportunity cost. He's under contract for 2026 at an $11.5 million wage that will make him the third-highest-paid Pirates player. Given Pittsburgh's history, it's possible he ends up being the winter's big splash. In turn, he may be exposed to expectations he may not be able to meet. Let's hope not, because Lowe at face value is a good addition: a bat-first, most-days starter who'll almost surely rank among Pittsburgh's two or three best hitters in 2026.\nMontgomery, 25, should enjoy the longest stay in Pittsburgh of the incoming players. He's a hard-throwing lefty who creates an optical nightmare for hitters thanks to his tall and deep release point. His fastball sits in the upper 90s and appears to defy gravity with above-average rising action. When he wants to take a little off, he turns to a gyro slider that grades well in isolation but that doesn't necessarily tunnel well off the heater -- batters are able to detect which of the two pitches is coming with high accuracy before they have to make a swing decision. Factor in Montgomery's below-average control, and he may continue to veer between stretches of dominance and inconsistency.Mangum, 29, is a switch-hitting, speed-and-D outfielder who notched a 96 OPS+ in his rookie season. Take the under on that figure going forward. He swings at everything and, often to his detriment, he usually makes contact. Mangum has the speed to beat out his share of mishits and squibbers, but he's without the bat speed to slug or the discipline to walk. In an ideal world, he's leveraged as a reserve.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Astros grade: CYou can argue the Astros, with a farm system that's long been depleted by win-now trades and late-round draft picks, gave up two of their three best prospects here. Evaluations of those players will differ -- I talked to an executive right after the deal who thought Houston fared well here -- but it is worth contemplating how this trade may impact the Astros' ability to do more later. \nAnyway, the prize here is Burrows, fresh off a rookie year that saw him compile a 3.94 ERA (109 ERA+) and a 3.13 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 23 appearances. He's sort of your classic No. 4 starter type in that he throws strikes with five pitches, including a good cambio and above-average slider. If I had to guess, I suspect he won't throw his four-seamer 40% of the time again heading forward. The catch is that Burrows also doesn't have much history of staying healthy, with his age-25 campaign representing the first time he's ever thrown more than 100 innings in a single season. Thinking of him as a safe quantity, then, is ignoring a very, very big part of this career story to date.The Astros have a better read on Burrows' health than I do. They also have a demonstrated track record of unlocking better work from pitchers than other teams have mustered. The second part makes this deal tougher to square, because I think a reasonable forecast for Burrows puts him within a performance range that would have been accessible to them in other pitchers who would not have necessitated sacrificing the top of their farm system. Clearly they disagree in that assessment. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Rays grade: BIn exchange for a year of Lowe, probably less of Mangum, and potentially several years of Montgomery, the Rays net two of the most interesting young players in the Astros system.\nMelton, 25, was terrible for the Astros last season during a 32-game big-league stint. That's life sometimes. He's a potential most-days option in the outfield thanks to his athleticism and his combination of strength and zone control against right-handed pitching. It wouldn't surprise me if the Rays tweak his swing a bit, since batters with his amount of loft generally have a pull-centric barrel angle. Depending on how that goes (if it goes at all) and what the Rays do the rest of the winter -- they've already added two veteran lefty hitters, in Cedric Mullins and Jake Fraley, to their outfield depth chart -- Melton could get a real, extended big-league opportunity by the summertime. Brito, 21, is a short right-hander with a lively arm who posted a 3.28 ERA and a 2.32 strikeout-to-walk ratio in the South Atlantic League. He later made four appearances in the Arizona Fall League, raising his stock by striking out 22 batters in 11 innings. Brito has touched 100 mph with his almost-cutting fastball, and the heater plays hotter thanks to him getting further down the mound than his 5-foot-10 frame suggests he should. He shows promise with a few secondary pitches, too, including a sweeper, curveball, and a changeup that features occasional sink. \nIn a past era, Brito would've already been assigned to a life in relief because of his size and delivery. He may end up there anyway, but the Rays have every reason to work with him on throwing more strikes as a starter.\n            ",

With all these factors in mind, we'll take Joshua to finish the job in the second round because any result other than early stoppage from the former champion will give legitimate fodder to the \"everything's scripted\" crowd, an omnipresent bunch that will undoubtedly watch regardless.\" Back Joshua at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Alabama vs. Oklahoma, Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua, and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

The NFL is about to find out. The Carolina Panthers (7-7) host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7) in a battle of division co-leaders coming off disappointing divisional losses to the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons, respectively.Tampa Bay technically is on top of the standings. Though, with both this game and a Week 18 rematch in Tampa Bay remaining, it's essentially a tie atop the NFL's most woeful division.Tampa Bay blew a 14-point fourth-quarter lead in a 29-28 \"Thursday Night Football\" loss to Atlanta last week, with a leaky defense, a Baker Mayfield interception and an ineffective running game all playing roles. Coach Todd Bowles unloaded on his team in an uncharacteristic, explicit post-game tirade.\"That's what you tell them in the locker room: 'Look in the f---ing mirror,'\" Bowles concluded.\nCarolina comes in with similar motivation after it blew a chance to take hold of the division lead with a 20-17 loss to New Orleans. The Saints outscored the Panthers 10-0 in the fourth quarter and out-gained them 172-42 in the final 15 minutes as well.Still, both teams have a chance to get right back on track with three weeks left.Below, you can find information on how to watch, betting odds, keys to the matchup and a prediction.\nWhere to watch Panthers vs. Buccaneers liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 21 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North CarolinaTV: Fox | Stream:  Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -3, O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Panthers vs. Buccaneers: Need to knowBuccaneers offense finally has all of its wide receivers. Last week, Tampa Bay had each of its four top wide receivers -- Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Emeka Egbuka and Jalen McMillan -- active together for the first time. In fact, it was the first time Evans, Godwin and Egbuka were together. Evans caught six passes for 132 yards in his first game since Week 7, and McMillan reeled in two catches for 38 yards. Overall, the Tampa Bay offense ran hot and cold, but still, this pass-catching group should take advantage of a Carolina defense that's allowing 7.0 net yards per pass attempt, 25th in the NFL.Panthers look to establish the run. Carolina is 6-4 when it rushes for at least 100 yards and 1-3 when it doesn't this season. It's also 4-0 when it rushes for at least 150 yards, with its two most impressive wins (over the Los Angeles Rams and the Green Bay Packers) coming in games where it went over 150. In the Panthers' ideal world, they get Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard going on the ground and allow Bryce Young to manage the game, making some throws downfield when he has to but mostly just keeping the offense on track. Tampa Bay is just middle of the pack defending the run this season, so establishing control in the trenches is key for Carolina.Massive stakes. SportsLine projections say Tampa Bay has a 91% chance to make the playoffs if it wins and only a 49% chance if it loses. Carolina, on the other hand, would have a 48% chance to make the playoffs if it wins and only an 8% chance to make it with a loss. The Buccaneers have an edge because they has a much easier Week 17 matchup in the Miami Dolphins while the Panthers must face the Seattle Seahawks, and the Week 18 Buccaneers-Panthers rematch is in Tampa. Long story short, Carolina really needs to win this one.Panthers vs. Buccaneers pick, prediction\nMayfield was the king of the clutch early in the season, but he struggled ever since a Week 7 shoulder injury. The Buccaneers' struggling defense hasn't helped matters, either. This is a massive opportunity for both teams, and one that could have a big say in Young's future in Carolina. It's the first meaningful December game for the Panthers in a while. Mayfield and the Buccaneers are used to it, and it will show.

The Vikings are trying to make it three wins in a row, and the Giants are hoping to snap an eight-game losing streak.Minnesota has two straight wins over NFC East opponents in the Washington Commanders and Dallas Cowboys, and they'll try to make it three in a row on Sunday. We'll also see whether J.J. McCarthy can keep his recent run of form going. In his past two games, McCarthy has thrown for a combined 413 yards, five touchdowns and one interception. Against a Giants defense that's been awful for most of the season, McCarthy has the opportunity to keep rolling. On defense, it'll be interesting to see what Brian Flores cooks up for the rookie quarterback on the other side.The Giants haven't won a game since beating the Eagles on Oct. 9, but five of those eight losses have come by one score. New York has been unable to get out of its own way -- and there isn't much incentive to stop now. The Giants currently own the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, and winning another game could jeopardize that. Of course, the team also wants to see continued development from rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart. He has been a bright spot in what has otherwise been a rather miserable campaign for the Giants.Here is everything you need to know about this showdown featuring two young NFC signal callers.\nWhere to watch Giants vs. Vikings liveDate: Sunday, Dec. 21 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: MetLife Stadium -- East Rutherford, New JerseyTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Vikings -3, O/U 43.5 (via DraftKings)Giants vs. Vikings: Need to knowJefferson needs a jumpstart. Justin Jefferson is in the midst of a nightmare season, and his production in recent weeks has been particularly anemic. Jefferson hasn't topped 80 receiving yards since Oct. 5, and he's averaging 59.4 yards per game. That's the lowest number of his career, and it's 28.1 yards fewer than his pervious career low of 87.5. Can this matchup against the Giants act as a slump buster?Giants getting gashed. Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason have to be licking their chops ahead of this matchup because the Giants haven't been able to stop anyone on the ground this season. New York is allowing 153.6 rushing yards per game, and only the Cincinnati Bengals allow more. Even if McCarthy does struggle a bit in the passing game, Kevin O'Connell should be able to take solace in the fact that his offense will be able to run at will.Anything but special teams in New York. The Giants special teams have been an unmitigated disaster in 2025, and the kicking carousel continued to spin this week. New York cut Younghoe Koo after he missed both of his field goal attempts in the team's Week 15 loss to the Washington Commanders. The team is now expected to elevate rookie kicker Ben Sauls from the practice squad, and he has yet to attempt a kick at the NFL level.Giants vs. Vikings prediction, pick\nThe Giants are a complete disaster, and the matchup of O'Connell's offensive scheme against this New York defense seems as lopsided as it gets. There may be a world wherein McCarthy comes back to Earth and Dart plays well enough for the Giants to pull off the upset at home, but the Vikings defense may prevent that scenario from unfolding. I'll go with Minnesota because of how discombobulated New York has looked in each of the last two weeks. Pick: Vikings -3, Over 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        There's good values, and there's bad values. We went over the good values in way-too-early drafts earlier this week, so for the last Fantasy Baseball Today Newsletter of 2026, let's take a look at some of the picks I wouldn't be making at their current price.That's not to say I don't like these 10 players, or that I won't be drafting them at all in 2026. Of course, there are a few players here whose price will likely prove too rich for my taste all offseason long, but for the most part, these 10 players just need to be a little cheaper to be worth buying into.This highlights something I've said a lot over the past few years but is always worth repeating: It's just a lot harder these days to find obviously overpriced players in Fantasy drafts. It still happens occasionally, but because every analyst and player is so sharp, there just aren't as many obviously mispriced players as there were even 10 years ago. You have to look a lot harder, and you have to pick a lot more nits to make the case against the wisdom of the crowds in Fantasy drafts nowadays. That's what we're doing today, but before we get to that, I just want to say thank you to everyone who subscribes and reads this newsletter and supports the Fantasy Baseball Today team in our podcasts, YouTube channel, or our writing. This is a dream job for us, and we can't do it without the support of our readers and listeners, so I just wanted to say thank you before signing off until January. We'll be back in a few weeks, rested and ready to get you through draft season with the best advice possible to build your teams. That's what we're here for, after all.\nNow, let's get to those 10 overpriced players in early ADP: \n10 early ADP fadesYoshinobu Yamamoto, SP, Dodgers (23.6)Yoshinobu Yamamoto is a great pitcher. And he's a great Fantasy player. But he's not a great pick with a second-round pick. The reason why mostly comes down to volume and workload – there just isn't much of a ceiling beyond the 173.2 innings he threw in 2025. The Dodgers have allowed him to throw on less than five days of rest in his career exactly once – when he got the win to close out the 2025 World Series. Otherwise, they have allowed Yamamoto to stay on an every-six-days plan, and that is almost certain to continue in 2026, especially with Shohei Ohtani and Roki Sasaki expected to be in the rotation with at least some kind of workload limitations. Now, of course, being limited to 170-175 innings doesn't mean Yamamoto can't be an impactful Fantasy pitcher, especially coming off a season where only 21 pitchers even got to 180 innings. It doesn't put you at that much of a deficit, especially when we're talking about a pitcher with high-end skills like Yamamoto. But it does mean that his ceiling is just a bit lower than some of the guys coming off the board behind him; someone like Chris Sale or Logan Gilbert might not be as safe a bet as Yamamoto for 170 very good innings, but Yamamoto doesn't have the 180-plus-inning ceiling those guys have. And if you're picking a starter in the second round, I think they probably need to have legit difference-making upside. I just don't know if Yamamoto has that. James Wood, OF, Nationals (29.9)I like Wood. In a draft I'm currently doing, I actually took him as my second outfielder to pair with Jackson Chourio (Elly De La Cruz was my first pick), and I'm happy with that combination's upside. But the key here is the price: I got Wood with the 39th pick, nearly 10 picks later than he typically goes. And that's just a much easier price to swallow for a guy with Wood's obvious limitations. \nWe saw those limitations in stark detail in the second half of 2025, as he slumped to a .223/.301/.388 line while striking out an alarming 39% of the time. And he largely earned those struggles, with his xwOBA dipping to .319 over his final 250 plate appearances compared to a .361 mark for the season as a whole. The full-season numbers were still very solid – .256-87-31-94-15 – and full-season numbers tend to be more predictive than partial-season numbers, so I'm not saying I expect Wood to hit in 2026 like he did in the second half. But that near-40% strikeout rate is just such a massive red flag when we're talking about a second-round pick in a 15-team league and an early-third in a 12-teamer, especially if he isn't going to be the high-volume base-stealer we hoped he would be. Aroldis Chapman, RP, Red Sox (58.0)Just … don't pay for the career year, especially for a 37-year-old. Chapman cut his walk rate from 14.4% in 2024 to 6.6% in 2025, going from a major liability in his game to a legitimate strength, and it fueled arguably the best season of what might end up a Hall of Fame-caliber career. Maybe he can sustain it, but Chapman hasn't had a walk rate below 10% since 2017 (outside of the shortened 2020 season), so it's fair to bet against it. Especially when we're talking about a reliever who throws just 60 or so innings every season. That's a small sample size, roughly the equivalent of two months from a starting pitcher. Now, it's worth noting that closer prices tend to get pushed up very aggressively in these early drafts, especially for the relatively few closers without much role risk. Chapman is going to be the Red Sox's closer in 2026; of that, we can be very sure, so pushing him up makes sense in that context. But I still think pushing him up as high as sixth among closers – ahead of Josh Hader! – just doesn't strike me as an especially wise move. \nFreddy Peralta, SP, Brewers (62.0)Say it with me: Don't pay for the career year! Peralta was more or less the same guy as always in 2025. His 3.47 xERA was within spitting distance of the 3.35 and 3.84 marks he posted in each of the previous two seasons, while his 2.70 actual ERA was nearly a full run better than he managed in either season. There's a similar story to be told with his other ERA estimators, which were all maybe slightly better than his previous couple of seasons, but not nearly by the same margin as his actual ERA. He's a good pitcher, albeit a pretty frustrating one at times, and he'll generally get you close to 200 strikeouts, a mark he has hit three straight seasons. But he's also never thrown 180 innings in a season and is coming off both an ERA and win total (17) that will be hard to repeat even if he isn't eventually traded by the Brewers at some point this offseason. This time last season, Peralta was a target for me with an ADP of 112.1. Now? He's a pretty easy fade at his current price, since nothing much has actually changed in his skill set. Josh Naylor, 1B, Mariners (69.2) What do we do with the steals? He stole 30 while ranking in the third percentile in sprint speed last season, and there's basically no precedent for that, including in Naylor's career, which featured a high of 10 steals prior to 2025. The fact that he is returning to Seattle helps his case – he stole 19 of his 30 bases in just 54 games after being traded there last summer – but expecting anything like a repeat of 30 steals is probably asking too much. \nAnd when you look at the rest of Naylor's skill set … It's fine. He hit .295 in 2025, which is terrific, but he's also been notoriously inconsistent with his batting average over the years, going from .256 to .308 to .243 in three seasons prior to 2025. He's also topped 20 homers just once, and while he held his own in his partial season in Seattle, it's still a very tough ballpark to call home. Naylor was the No. 21 hitter in 2025, per the FanGraphs.com Player Rater, worth $23.8. $4.9 of that came from stolen bases; if he reverts back to being a single-digit stolen base source like he was for most of his career pre-2025, you're probably looking at more like a $15 player. And with the batting average fluctuations we've seen in the past, that's not as safe a $15 player as you'd like. Oneil Cruz, OF, Pirates (85.8)Now this one I just don't get. Is there some kind of collective delusion going on with Cruz? I understand the argument for his upside, given his world-class athleticism and top-of-the-scale raw power, but … he's 27 years old! He has over 1,500 plate appearances to his name in the majors. If he was going to level up significantly, wouldn't it likely have already happened? Does it really make sense to talk about potential with a player with this much experience in the majors?Cruz did take a big step forward in the stolen base category in 2025, which helped keep his value from totally cratering, but even then, he was actively harmful in three of the five Roto categories, hitting just .200 with 62 runs and 61 RBI. And there is real playing time risk here for Cruz, who just looks totally overmatched against left-handed pitching, hitting just .177/.255/.311 when he didn't have the platoon advantage in 2025. Given that he is, at best, just a fine defender, there's some real risk of the Pirates simply turning a significant chunk of his playing time over to someone else in a season where they are seemingly trying to actually win games. \nDrake Baldwin, C, Braves (92.7)Baldwin is a terrific player. As a rookie catcher, he went out there and hit .274/.341/.469, and very little of it seemed like a fluke. He won't turn 25 until shortly after Opening Day and has the prospect pedigree and minor-league track record to back up what he did en route to winning Rookie of the Year. Even in a more stacked catcher landscape than I can remember for Fantasy, Baldwin's skill set stands out.I'm just not sure his playing time does. Not after the Braves signed Mike Yastrzemski to a deal big enough to at least assume he's going to see plenty of playing time in 2026. That signing likely moves Jurickson Profar to a full-time DH role, and that makes it tough to project Baldwin for the kind of playing time some of the true difference makers at the catcher position can get. I would bet on Baldwin being the primary catcher for the Braves in 2026, making him a good bet to top the 446 plate appearances he got as a rookie. But unless Sean Murphy is traded, it seems unlikely the Braves are just going to outright bench him when he's making serious cash. The one caveat here is that Murphy is coming back from hip surgery, and while he could be ready for Opening Day, that hasn't been quite confirmed. If Murphy's season is delayed and he isn't capable of being an impact bat coming off the injury, Baldwin's path to 550-plus PA becomes a lot more clear. I'm still not sure I'd be comfortable with a top-100 pick on him, but I can at least make the case for it. \nMichael Busch, 1B, Cubs (110.5)Here's the question with Busch: How much do you buy his age-27 breakout? He went from an interesting corner infield option to one of the better power hitters in the league in 2025, and the underlying data backs it up – he went from an 89.9 mph average exit velocity to a 92.2 mph mark in 2025, while his expected wOBA on contact jumped from .399 to .461. And he cut his strikeout rate from 28.6% to 23.5%. He basically got better at everything … though he didn't really improve his most notable shortcoming much, as Busch hit just .207/.274/.368 while still being shielded from many of the toughest lefties. He was so good against righties (.910 OPS, 30 homers in 497 plate appearances) that it didn't really matter very much, but it's still an awfully high price to pay for a guy who was pretty much just a platoon bat last season, starting 11 of 42 games against left-handed starters. If he's able to replicate last season's success against righties, it won't matter much, but it doesn't give him a huge margin for error at this cost. Andy Pages, OF, Dodgers (127.9)Anytime you can spend an 11th-round pick on a guy who was benched for the most important games of the season, I think you've pretty clearly got to do it.\nIn all honesty, I just don't think Pages is a particularly good hitter. He's not terrible, but I think even his .774 OPS in 2025 was probably an overperformance – he put up a .315 expected wOBA to an actual mark of .332. There's a bit of pop here, but the quality of contact here on the whole is pretty average, with Pages' ability to pull the ball in the air consistently helping him outrun that a bit. But when you combine average-ish quality of contact skills with poor plate discipline, that's a recipe for inconsistency at best. We saw a big second-half slump, and I think there's a real chance that's the guy we get in 2026. Emmet Sheehan, SP, Dodgers (137.6)I love Emmett Sheehan. I just wish I was more confident that the Dodgers love Sheehan. There should be a role for him in the team's rotation, with one spot left in their likely six-man alignment. That should be Sheehan's spot after he put together a 2.82 ERA in 73.1 innings in 2026, but that's no guarantee at this point. The Dodgers kept Sheehan in the rotation for much of the second half of 2025, but when they looked to skip a spot in the rotation, it was usually his, and by the time the playoffs rolled around, Sheehan was plucked from the rotation to serve in a relief role … which did not go well, by the way. Maybe his struggles pitching out of the bullpen will convince the Dodgers he needs a set routine and a spot in the rotation for good. I hope so, because Sheehan has massive strikeout upside and could be a must-start Fantasy option with a consistent role. But being the sixth man in a six-man rotation narrows your margin for error considerably, and with Gavin Stone and River Ryan expected back in 2026 and the Dodgers' usual cohort of viable options hanging around in the high-minors, Sheehan won't have much room for things to go wrong. A poor run in Spring Training could cost him his expected rotation spot, and guys with that kind of workload concern typically don't go this early in drafts. \n            ",

It is also a major risk for Joshua, who is no longer at his peak but isn't ready to hang up the gloves yet.Both fighters are getting huge paydays, and bettors are looking for their own hauls, with 83% of DraftKings bets on a winner coming in on Paul and 95% looking for it to go the distance. A whopping 95% of bets made have the fight going Over 2.5 rounds.   Joshua is using this as a tune-up fight for a potential showdown with Tyson Fury next year, and he isn't taking it lightly. Early skepticism and rumblings that the fight is somehow not on the up-and-up have the former champ fired up. He says anything short of a first-round knockout would be a failure, and he even made controversial comments about killing his opponent in the ring.  The 36-year-old gives up eight years to Paul, but he is 5 inches taller at 6-foot-6 and weighs about 27 pounds heavier, with Joshua coming in just below the contract-stipulated 245-pound threshold. Joshua also has a 6-inch reach advantage and a massive experience edge on Paul. Joshua has a 28-3 professional record with 25 knockouts, and his three career losses have come to Oleksandr Usyk, Andy Ruiz Jr. and Daniel Dubois. His last fight was a fifth-round loss via knockout to Dubois in September 2024, and he needed elbow surgery following that fight. Joshua has also been in the ring with the likes of Wladimir Klitschko and Alexander Povetkin and has been in 13 world-title fights. In addition to holding the unified heavyweight title twice, Joshua won gold at the 2012 Summer Olympics when he edged Italy's Roberto Cammarelle in a super heavyweight bout in his hometown of London.  Joshua is hoping to avoid a major misstep as he eyes a chance to settle the question of who the best British heavyweight of the generation is. Assuming he wins Friday, Joshua expects to fight another tune-up in early 2026 before what he hopes is a fight against fellow two-time world heavyweight champion Fury this time next year.  There have been rumblings about the matchup for more than a decade, and a fight was agreed to in 2020 before Deontay Wilder threatened legal action that forced Fury to fight him instead. Talks are ongoing, and Fury has indicated he will come out of retirement again to face Joshua if the right deal can be reached.   Paul has the advantage of youth and has fought twice in the 14 months that Joshua has been out of action. He is 12-1 in his career with seven knockouts, but the 28-year-old has mostly faced retired UFC fighters and aging boxing stars. His only loss was by split decision against Tommy Fury in February 2023, and he has won six fights since then. He defeated a 57-year-old Mike Tyson by unanimous decision in a widely-panned fight last November, and Paul's most recent bout was a unanimous decision over 39-year-old Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. in June.   A fight against WBA lightweight champion Gervonta Davis was expected in November, but unrelated Davis legal issues derailed those plans. Paul's other fights have included bouts with former UFC stars Nate Diaz, Anderson Silva and Tyron Woodley.   Paul vs. Joshua will consist of eight three-minute rounds, and the fighters will wear 10-ounce gloves, the standard for heavyweight bouts. There are nine fights on the undercard, including four title fights in lower weight classes.

    "body": "\n        As part of a pair of notable Friday trades involving Tampa Bay, the Orioles have acquired hard-throwing right-hander Shane Baz from the Rays in exchange for outfielder Slater de Brun, catcher Caden Bodine, right-hander Michael Forret, outfielder Austin Overn, and a Competitive Balance Round A pick in this year's MLB Draft, the Athletic reports. The other Rays Friday deal was a three-way trade with the Pirates and Astros that saw them part with slugging second baseman Brandon Lowe. Baz, 26, is coming off a 2025 season in which he registered an 84 ERA+ and an FIP of 4.37 in 166 ⅓ innings for the Rays. That marked the first time Baz had logged a qualifying number of innings in a major league season. Indeed, he underwent Tommy John surgery in September of 2022, and that cost him all of the 2023 season and a good chunk of 2024. For his career, Baz has an ERA+ of 95 across parts of four big-league seasons. The Orioles, though, are betting on Baz's stuff. Last season, he averaged 97 mph with his fastball – elite velocity for a starting pitcher – and his knuckle curve has wipeout potential. Baz is under team control through the 2028 season, after which he'll be eligible for free agency. The Rays originally acquired Baz as part of the 2018 trade that sent Chris Archer to the Pirates in exchange for Tyler Glasnow and Austin Meadows. Baz was the player to be named later in the deal. On the Tampa Bay side, Bodine was the No. 30 overall pick in last year's draft, and de Brun was No. 37. Forret, 21, has an ERA of 2.90 and a K/BB ratio of 3.31 across parts of two minor league seasons. In 2025, he reached Double-A. Overn, a former third-rounder out of Southern Cal, has an OPS of .772 in 135 minor league games. He likewise reached Double-A last season. The other trade in which the Rays were involved in on Friday sent Lowe to the Pirates from the Rays and right-hander Mike Burrows from the Pirates to the Astros. The Rays, meantime, received a pair of young players. \nHere's how the full trade, if finalized will look, according to Ken Rosenthal: To Astros: RHP Mike BurrowsTo Rays: OF Jacob Melton, RHP Anderson BritoTo Pirates: INF Brandon Lowe, LHP Mason Montgomery, OF Jake MangumLowe, 31 and going into his walk year, is a primary second baseman with good power. He's coming off a 31-homer season in 2025, and in 2021 he hit a career-high 39 home runs for the Rays. For his career, Lowe has an OPS+ of 123 and a WAR of 17.8 across parts of eight MLB seasons. Burrows, 26 and a rookie last season, pitched to a 109 ERA+ and a 4.00 FIP in 96 innings last season. Of his 23 games pitched in 2025, 19 were starts. Burrows averaged 95.5 mph with his fastball last season and earned a 43.1% whiff rate on his changeup.Melton is a lefty-swinging outfielder who popped up on the occasional top-100 prospect list coming up through the Houston system. He made his MLB debut last season, and he's 25 years of age. Brito, 21, has an ERA of 2.36 in two minor league seasons. He's struck out 147 batters in 103 professional innings, and he spent the majority of last season at High-A. \nFrom the Rays' standpoint, these deals restock their reserves of young talent, give them more years of control, and shed the arbitration salaries of Lowe and Baz. As well, the recent signing of Steven Matz gave the Rays some measure of flexibility when it comes to trading from their rotation depth. \n            ",

That set up the Broncos to blow through their MAC schedule, losing just once SU. Their calling card is defense. The unit yields just 18.2 ppg, 14th best in FBS, and the yardage allowance is 15th. On offense, QB Broc Lowry is a dual threat, with six rushing and no passing TDs in the past four games -- all victories. Kennesaw State has lived a charmed life this season after winning twice outright a year ago. Fairy tales usually end, and the Owls' wondrous journey should close out with a loss. \n                                    \n            ",

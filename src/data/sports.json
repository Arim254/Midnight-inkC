    "body": "\n        The latest bet365 bonus code CBSBET365 gives new users $200 in bonus bets after placing a first wager of $5 or more, and Friday features a top 10 college basketball rivalry matchup to utilize this promotion when No. 3 Michigan visits No. 7 Michigan State (+2.5) on Friday at 8 p.m. ET. One of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a pick on Michigan vs. Michigan State to feature in Friday best bets at bet365.Friday also features a nine-game NBA slate, and the SportsLine proven computer model has picked out a pair of NBA best bets, backing the Toronto Raptors to upset the Orlando Magic (-2.5) at +105 odds and the Denver Nuggets to cover as 2.5-point underdogs against the Los Angeles Clippers. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns. Bet games at bet365 here:Friday's top picks, best betsRaptors (+105) to defeat the MagicMichigan State (+1) vs. Michigan (-110)Nuggets (+6.5) vs. Clippers (-115)Combining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at bet365 would result in a payout of +632 (risk $100 to win $632). Bet it at bet365 here:Raptors (+105) to defeat the Magic\nThe Raptors had their four-game winning streak snapped in a 119-92 loss to the Knicks on Wednesday, but the Knicks are one of the favorites to win the Eastern Conference and are tied for the second-best record in the conference, so that's certainly not a bad loss. The game before, the Raptors defeated the Thunder, 103-101, on the road, proving they have the talent to knock off any team in the league. A recent win in Oklahoma City means a trip to Orlando shouldn't intimidate the Raptors, who are 29-20 this season. The Magic (24-22) are coming off a 133-124 win over the Heat on Wednesday, but they lost four straight before that contest. The Raptors have won four straight games against Orlando, including a 107-106 win in December. The model projects Toronto win in 64% of simulations, showcasing strong value at plus-money odds. Back the Raptors at bet365 here:Michigan State (+2.5) vs. Michigan (-110)\"Both of these teams enter their first of two regular season rivalry showdowns coming off sweaty mid-week wins, with Michigan snatching victory from Nebraska and Sparty having to roar back from a potential upset spot against Rutgers,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"But while Michigan State might have been caught in a lookahead spot, I think Michigan's close win is more in line with its recent form. The Wolverines have failed to cover in each of their last seven games, and there are some matchup points that will allow Michigan State to negate some of what has made Michigan so excellent this season. Plus, Tom Izzo at home as an underdog in a rivalry game? I'll take those points all day.\" Back Michigan State at bet365 here:Nuggets (+2.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Nuggets play the second half of a back-to-back following a 107-103 victory over the Nets, which could signal multiple players sitting out Friday given the amount of injuries currently facing Denver. However, the Nuggets retain homecourt advantage for Friday, and they are 13-9 in Denver this season. The Clippers aren't at full health either, including Kawhi Leonard (knee) as questionable. The Clippers are on a roll, winning nine of their last 10 games, but six of those wins came against losing teams. Even with Denver's injury situation, which has featured Nikola Jokic (knee) out for weeks, only the Thunder and Pistons have more wins than the Nuggets this season. Denver enters at 32-16 and the Clippers are 22-24. The model projects the Nuggets to cover in 59% of simulations. Back the Nuggets at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Friday.

    "body": "\n        It's time to kick off one of the best times of year for wrestling fans. The Road to WrestleMania gets underway on Saturday night in Saudi Arabia when WWE takes the Royal Rumble to Riyadh. One of the promotion's tentpole events, the Royal Rumble began running annually in 1988. It presents the 30 participants with the opportunity to be in a championship match at WrestleMania. Last year saw an incredible bit of theater in the men's match as it came down to Jey Uso and John Cena, who was participating in his final Royal Rumble amid his retirement tour. Uso managed to finish things off by tossing Cena over the top rope and he capped it off by besting Gunther for the world heavyweight title in April.While there are some superstars who have declared their entry into the over-the-top-rope elimination match, there's always a handful of surprises fans don't see coming between both the men's and women's matches.\n        \n            \n                WWE burning questions for the Road to WrestleMania 42: Who wins the Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber and more\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere are two supporting matches to the card on Saturday. One is a world title match between undisputed WWE champion Drew McIntyre and Sami Zayn. McIntyre finally got over the hump and bested Rhodes in Three Stages of Hell earlier this month to claim the title. Now he takes on a familiar foe who he is undefeated against in singles competition in Zayn, who just so happens to also have never held a world title. \nPlus, Gunther is set for a singles match against AJ Styles where if Gunther wins, Styles will be forced to retire. Gunther retired two legends of the industry in 2025 when he beat Goldberg and John Cena. Now, Styles, who already said this would be his last year of in-ring competition, faces the potential of his retirement tour being cut short early on. Take a look below at the confirmed matches for the Royal Rumble as well as our staff picks and predictions for each match. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited with the main card starting at 2 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Royal Rumble matchesMen's Royal  Rumble match -- Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, Gunther, Jey Uso, Rey Mysterio, Jacob Fatu, Solo Sikoa, Dragon Lee, Penta, Bron Breakker, Logan Paul, Bronson Reed, Austin Theory, Je'Von Evans, Oba Femi, Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar and 13 more: The match already has a who's who of entrants that we know. There's five surefire Hall of Famers, former world champions and plenty of upstart talent set to participate. Be on the look out for The Vision and the four members who are set to enter. They could pose a united front and take out much of the field.\nUndisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: McIntyre learned the identity of his first title challenger at Saturday Night's Main Event. Randy Orton, Trick Williams, Damian Priest and Zayn met in a No. 1 contender's match after winning their qualifying matches. Zayn stood tall in Montreal, catching Priest with a Helluva Kick to punch his ticket to the Rumble. Zayn has never won a world title in WWE, and has made it his mission to change his fortunes this year.Women's Royal Rumble match -- Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, Roxanne Perez, Liv Morgan, Raquel Rodriguez, Bayley, Lyra Valkyria, Asuka, Chelsea Green, Jordynne Grace, Charlotte Flair, Alexa Bliss, Nia Jax, Lash Legend, Giulia, Maxxine Dupri, Becky Lynch and 13 more: The women's Rumble is stacked. Eight former women's world champions are among the 15 superstars currently announced for the match. Expect more stars to throw their names into the hat before the Rumble begins.AJ Styles vs. Gunther: Gunther is turning into a new age Legend Killer. Last year, \"The Ring General\" retired both John Cena and Goldberg. He wants to do the same to Styles. \"The Phenomenal\" one previously announced he'd retire in 2026, but Gunther hopes to expedite the process. Gunther stole a victory from Styles on Monday Night Raw, and only granted him a rematch under the condition that Styles retires if he loses at the Rumble.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Sports Commission is currently investigating LSU for potential unreported NIL deals in violation of rules governing player compensation, per an email obtained by The Athletic. In that email sent on Jan. 15 to LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry, the CSC's head of investigations, Katie B. Medearis, informed the school that they were investigating whether they \"failed to report one or more third-party Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals,\" and requested a phone call with Ausberry or the LSU compliance staff. While the timing suggested it could be related to LSU's active transfer portal activity in football, where Lane Kiffin and the Tigers put together the No. 1 class in the country, NOLA.com reports the investigation is not related to the football program. This is the first known investigation by the CSC, which was formulated by the power conferences last year to govern revenue sharing and verify NIL deals under the new rules set by the House settlement in 2024. \nThe CSC issued a brief statement to The Athletic, confirming they have reached out to multiple schools regarding investigations.\"As previously indicated, the CSC has reached out to several schools to inform them of investigations into unreported NIL deals,\" a CSC spokesperson said. \"We will not comment further at this time.\"The specifics of the CSC's investigation into LSU are unknown, as nothing in their email to LSU detailed what players, sports or deals may be under scrutiny. \nThere remains a question of how much teams will cooperate with CSC investigations, and LSU figures to be the first -- and biggest -- test case for the commission. Their first task will be finding firm evidence to confirm any unreported NIL deals, but what the college sports world will really be looking at is what punishment they're able to levy if they do. LSU released a statement to NOLA.com stating they expected the investigation to be resolved quickly. \"We have been in regular communication with the CSC since the organization's formation and appreciate their ongoing collaboration and guidance,\" LSU spokesperson Zach Greenwell said in a statement. \"We anticipate this specific inquiry will be resolved shortly. We will not comment further on regulatory matters.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        UFC 325 is set to go down in Australia this Saturday, making for a second consecutive weekend with a numbered UFC event. In the night's main event, featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski will face Diego Lopes in a rematch.Volkanovski won the first meeting at UFC 314 by unanimous decision. That win kicked off Volkanovski's second reign as champion after he'd dropped the title to Ilia Topuria in February 2024.There's fun action fights to be found all over this event. Rafael Fiziev and Mauricio Ruffy are sure to deliver the goods when they clash in a lightweight contest on the main card. Plus, fan favorite Tai Tuivasa is always willing to lay it all on the line when he enters the Octagon. He gets a stiff test from rising contender Tallison Teixeira. And the main card opener could give us another highlight to remember when Quillan Salkilld returns to take on veteran Jamie Mullarkey. Salkilld scored a pair of incredible knockouts in 2025 that left fans speechless, including a head kick of Nasrat Haqparast that earn CBS Sports' KO of the Year.As with any UFC pay-per-view event, there's sure to be plenty of action at the sportsbook window, and with that in mind, we are taking a look at the best bet to make for every main card fight at UFC 325.\nSign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!After going 31-25 for our best bets in 2025, we kicked off 2026 by going 3-2 at UFC 324. Now we look ahead to this weekend, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.  Bet UFC 325 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nQuillan Salkilld\tvs.\tJamie MullarkeyQuillan Salkilld via KO/TKO/DQ (-145)Salkilld scored two massive knockouts in three 2025 victories, including the CBS Sports Knockout of the Year. Mullarkey is 4-4 since 2022, and he has been stopped by knockout or TKO in all four of his losses. Salkilld averages 1.3 more strikes landed per minute and absorbs nearly one less. All of that adds up to a fair chance that Salkilld scores yet another viral knockout to rile up his countrymen.Tai Tuivasa\tvs.\tTallison TeixeiraTallison Teixeira via KO/TKO/DQ (-225)Teixeira is coming off a disappointing TKO loss to Derrick Lewis on a somewhat questionable stoppage. That said, Tuivasa is on a five-fight losing skid and lacks the unique physical tools Teixeira has. Teixeira is a towering 6-foot-7, giving him a five-inch advantage in height over Tuivasa. Teixeira utilizes all four limbs well in his attack and that should allow him to bully Tuivasa both at distance and in the clinch. This seems like it will be Tuivasa's last ride in the UFC.Rafael Fiziev\tvs.\tMaurício RuffyRafael Fiziev moneyline (+100)Fiziev vs. Ruffy is a very even fight on paper, which means you have to find the little edges where the fight can be decided. Both men have power in their strikes, though Ruffy may be a little more fluid in his attack. But in Ruffy's most recent fight, a second-round submission loss to Benoit Saint Denis, he was taken down repeatedly and showed no ability to get off his back. Fiziev has never been a guy who focuses on his grappling, except that he has six takedowns in his two most recent fights. His team has no doubt planned for exploiting that weakness in Ruffy's game and that gives Fiziev enough of an edge to take him in this pick'em fight.\nDan Hooker\tvs.\tBenoit Saint DenisBenoit Saint Denis via KO/TKO/DQ or Submission (-130)Saint Denis suffered a pair of brutal back-to-back losses to Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano in 2024 but has rebounded with three impressive victories. Hooker represents the exact kind of opponent that Saint Denis can unload his entire game on. Hooker is very wide-open in his attack, absorbing as many significant strikes as he lands per minute and with good, but not great, takedown defense. Saint Denis averages nearly five takedowns per 15 minutes, while Hooker defends takedowns at 77%. Saint Denis should be able to take advantage of Hooker's defensive holes, both in striking and in grappling. Once Saint Denis gets rolling, he should be able to find a finish against Hooker, who has seven stoppage losses in his career.Alexander Volkanovski vs.\tDiego LopesAlexander Volkanovski moneyline (-148)I struggle to see any reason why this rematch looks much different from the first meeting. Volkanovski is one of the craftiest fighters of the era, rarely making mistakes. There's no shame in losing to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria, who may be the two best fighters on the planet. Is Lopes in that group? I don't believe so. Lopes is good enough to get the win, as he showed when he hurt Volkanovski late in their first meeting. But Volkanovski is the better all-around fighter, and he is the favorite for a reason. We'll roll with Volkanovski to repeat his victory and continue to build his resume as one of the greatest featherweights in history.Who wins Volkanovski vs. Lopes, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

It's a busy month on Paramount+ with consecutive weeks of numbered events. UFC 325 takes place in Sydney on Sunday (Saturday in the United States), a week after the incredible scenes from UFC 324 in Las Vegas.Volkanovski, the UFC featherweight champion, has deja vu. While he had pictured a fight against Movsar Evloev or Lerone Murphy, Volkanovski instead fights Lopes for the second time in a row. Volkanovski shushed retirement rumors, but conceded that he's closer to the finish line than the start. Already one of the best featherweights in history, Volkanovski is determined to savor every moment of his second reign as champion.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Lopes took a short detour between Volkanovski fights. Lopes, who graduated from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years, is coming off a knockout win over Jean Silva that was in the running for CBS Sports' 2025 Fight of the Year. Lopes is an impressive dual threat who captured fans' attention with his ability to knock people out or submit them with equal efficacy. Speaking of knockouts, it's very unlikely UFC 325's co-main event makes it to the scorecards. Dan Hooker is one of the best action athletes in the sport, but his chin will be tested by his upcoming opponent. Benoit Saint Denis' last 10 fights ended with a finish. He touches down in Australia on a three-fight winstreak, most recently knocking out ranked contender Beneil Dariush in 16 seconds.\nBet UFC 325 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:There's fun action fights to be found all over this event.

The event will take place on April 4 from the 02 Arena in London.\"The Bronze Bomber\" will be looking to win back-to-back fights for the first time since 2019, as the once undefeated heavyweight champion has gone 2-4 in his last six fights. Wilder did pick up a knockout win over Tyrrell Anthony Herndon back in June, bouncing back into the winner's circle after losses to Joseph Parker and Zhilei Zhang. Chisora enters the bout on a three-fight winning streak, defeating Gerald Washington, Joe Joyce and Otto Wallin in his three most recent fights. The 42-year-old \"War\" Chisora is among the most experienced heavyweights still fighting and has faced many of the biggest names in the division over the past two decades. Of his 13 losses, many are to former world champs, including Tyson Fury (three times), Joseph Parker (twice), Oleksandr Usyk and Vitali Klitschko. \nThis fight will be important for both men as they look to re-establish themselves as contenders in the heavyweight division. \nWilder and Chisora's bout sets up a big April for the heavyweight division. Tyson Fury, the former champ with five combined wins over Wilder and Chisora, will end his latest retirement and return to the ring one week later on April 11 in a fight with Arslanbek Makhmudov in the United Kingdom. That fight could be the precursor to a highly anticipated bout with Anthony Joshua, although Joshua's future in the ring remains in question after sustaining injuries in a fatal car crash in Nigeria in late December. \n            \n    ",

Epstein, who died by suicide in a federal jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in August 2019, directly communicated with Tisch in the correspondence. Epstein appeared to be not only scouting women for Tisch but also facilitating introductions between women and Tisch. The two also exchanged follow-up commentary after meetings.In several email exchanges, Epstein and Tisch discussed whether women were \"pro or civilian\" or a \"working girl.\" Epstein sent descriptions of women's backgrounds, appearances and personalities, and in some cases, followed up with reports on such meetings. Tisch responded to a number of those messages.Neither the NFL nor the Giants immediately responded to requests for comment by CBS Sports.Fisch, a film producer responsible for the likes of \"Forrest Gump\" and \"American History X,\" took his role with the Giants in 2005. Epstein, a former banker, has faced charges of human trafficking, child sex offenses and serial rape.There are three primary periods of communication between Fisch and Epstein uncovered in the DOJ release.\nMay 2013Emails show Epstein communicating with Tisch, who was attending NFL meetings. After Tisch replied that he was, \"Still in NFL meeting,\" Epstein suggested arranging a meeting with a woman he identified as Russian. Tisch responded minutes later by asking, \"Is she fun?\" The exchange continued that afternoon.June 2013Emails show Tisch asking Epstein directly about specific women. In one exchange, Epstein described a woman as \"exotic,\" noting she spoke mostly French. Tisch replied by asking, \"Working girl?\" Epstein responded, \"Never.\"In a separate exchange, Tisch asked, \"Is my present in NYC?\" Epstein replied, \"Yes.\" Tisch followed up the next morning, asking, \"Can I get my surprise to take me to lunch tomorrow?\"In another exchange, Epstein described a woman in explicit terms, noting she had a \"10 ass,\" and encouraged Tisch to contact her. Tisch replied, \"Thanks Jeffrey,\" and asked about another woman, inquiring as to whether she was \"pro or civilian?\" Epstein responded that she was a \"civilian,\" adding further personal commentary.Epstein sent messages offering detailed commentary after meetings had taken place. In one follow-up, Epstein wrote that Tisch \"did very well,\" adding that the woman was \"a little freaked by the age difference\" and advising him to \"go slow.\" Epstein also referenced attempting to influence her not to return to Ukraine, writing that \"having her crying worked.\" Tisch replied, \"Nice report … Funny comment on crying!!!\"September 2013Emails show social exchanges between Epstein and Tisch tied to the Giants. Tisch offered Epstein two tickets to his suite for a game and invited him to attend other games during the season. Epstein, in turn, invited Tisch to visit him on his private island in the Caribbean, though the emails do not indicate whether Tisch accepted.In another exchange, Epstein wrote to Tisch that he was \"happy to have you as a new but … shared interest friend.\"In 1991, Tisch's family purchased a 50% stake in the Giants franchise. He has accepted the Vince Lombardi Trophy on behalf of the organization following Super Bowl victories after the 2007 and 2011 seasons. His brother, Jonathan Tisch, serves as the team's treasurer.\nThe DOJ has said the release of communications involving Epstein is part of an effort to make previously undisclosed materials public, noting that a person's inclusion in the documents does not, by itself, indicate criminal conduct. The department has come under fire for the delayed release of these files as it missed a Dec. 19, 2025, deadline established by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, as passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 rookie class is phenomenal – if you play in IDP leagues.       Defenses dominated the week's Senior Bowl practices, leaving offensive highlights fairly sparing by comparison. It meant for an underwhelming week, which may very well be par for the course in a draft cycle where people across the league believe that there is far more talent on defense than on offense, especially among skill-position players.       Last year there were 17 rookies taken within the first 12 rounds of redraft leagues according to CBS Sports Average Draft Position. Of the 17, five averaged a selection within the first six rounds.       Expect those numbers to slide a little bit with the 2026 class. Simply put, the talent pool isn't as deep, and it would be criminal to try and sell you on this year's rookie class as if it were as rich as last year's.       That being said, there were some skill-position players who differentiated themselves through the Senior Bowl practices. Don't think of them as rising to the point where they'll be first-rounders, but rather rising above the average-level prospects. They'll have a chance to be good for Fantasy if they can find the right spot – which is always the case but especially important this year given the lack of high-level talent.      \nHere's a look at the players who stood out during the week – strictly based on what I saw this week and not taking into account anything they or anyone else did during the college season.              Quarterbacks      Cole Payton, North Dakota State: I thought Payton was the most accurate and anticipatory thrower all week who also made a handful of off-schedule plays. Not until the third practice did he start showing some flaws in his passing, and even then he still made some quality throws. He was known just as much for his rushing as his passing playing at the FCS level but really let his arm do the talking this week. That's a good thing since both factors can eventually make him a potential Fantasy option when and if he gets the chance to play.       \nTaylen Green, Arkansas: Green is tall, lanky and lean with a big arm and real good mobility. As project-QBs go he's great, but he doesn't have the consistency needed to be an NFL starter anytime soon. A team will draft him for his traits and put him on a pathway to be a starter in a year or so if he improves. Fantasy managers can hope for such a thing because if he does then his aggressive throwing and rushing combo will yield some nice stats.       \n      Running backs      Mike Washington Jr., Arkansas: It was Washington's acceleration that separated him from the rest of a decent running back group. That quick speed will translate to the pro game, and his thicker-than-most frame will create problems for defenses that can't wrap him up at first contact. Washington's receiving skills were also on display throughout the week and even his pass protection wasn't bad (he told CBS Sports he was working on it for the combine). If there was a RB in Mobile who had a chance to be a three-down player at some point before the end of next season, it would be Washington.       \nKaytron Allen, Penn State: I like Allen for his one-cut downhill running style and good speed. He can run with physicality, and he's not a finished product in pass protection but he's not bad at all. I wouldn't be surprised if he began his career getting around eight touches per game.       \n      Wide receivers      Malachi Fields, Notre Dame: Tall and rangy with good footwork, Fields could compete for maybe a 50% route participation rate right away. His ball tracking skills were great and he had this nuance in his technique to know just how to separate from coverage at just the right time to make a catch. He won't win a lot of races with pure speed but that's to be expected from someone as big as he is.       \nJosh Cameron, Baylor: Cameron might have been the most versatile receiver at the Senior Bowl. He had the speed to blow past coverage, the quick feet to change directions and separate by a yard or two at will, the eyeballs to track downfield throws properly, the ability to adjust his body to off-target throws and the hands to reel them in. Built in the mold of A.J. Brown and Anquan Boldin, Cameron has the traits teams look for when they need a real good complementary receiver, but he might have just enough to become a No. 1 someday.       \nCaleb Douglas, Texas Tech: A little leaner than most would want from a 6-foot-3 receiver, but that lack of weight is what gives him a little more speed compared to other big men. I thought he had some real good hands and flashed some explosiveness in his breaks at times.       \nTyren Montgomery, John Carroll: Not the biggest guy and certainly not the most experienced receiver considering he played in Division III, but Montgomery put himself on the radar with a solid week's worth of work. The top trait was his footwork, be it off the snap or at the top of his route to get himself open. He had the speed and route discipline to beat FBS-level cornerbacks on several occasions. And Montgomery still has more room to grow – he's only been playing football for two years!     \n     Tight ends     Tanner Koziol, Houston: This is the only tight end who flashed over multiple practices. He leaped high for a pass in the back corner of the end zone and otherwise was that sweet combination of sure-handed and physical. You won't see big-time speed, but his size and hands make him a differentiator compared to the rest of the class.       \nNate Boerkircher, Texas A&M: Great size, good technique and really good concentration was always a part of his game at school, but it took the Senior Bowl for him to show it often enough in practice and prove he can be a good receiving threat.     \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens are expected to hire Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Declan Doyle for the same role on new coach Jesse Minter's inaugural staff, sources tell CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. Doyle, who mentored Bears quarterback Caleb Williams to a career year on Ben Johnson's staff in Chicago in 2025, now gets to work with another top NFL signal caller in Lamar Jackson. Doyle, just 29, is expected to handle primary play-calling duties on Minter's staff. The 2025 season was Doyle's first as an offensive coordinator, as he joined Bears coach Johnson's first staff in Chicago. Johnson, who spent three seasons as the offensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions, was the primary playcaller for the Bears. Doyle helped develop the game plan and studied film with Johnson as the Bears climbed out of the NFC North cellar and into the postseason for the first time since 2020. Now he will become the youngest offensive playcaller in the NFL.Under Johnson and Doyle's guidance, the Bears finished sixth in the NFL in total offense (369.2 yards per game) and ninth in scoring offense (25.9 points per game). Chicago's 144.5 yards rushing per game also ranked third in the league, behind only the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore. Williams, a former first overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, threw for a career-high 3,942 yards and 27 touchdowns on 6.9 yards per attempt. Chicago's offensive line also took a big step forward, as it went from allowing a league-worst 68 sacks in 2024 to just 24 in 2025. \n\n        \n            \n                Ravens introduce Jesse Minter: What we learned about new Baltimore coach's plans for Lamar Jackson, more\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMinter is taking over in Baltimore for John Harbaugh, who was fired after 18 seasons. Minter was a former assistant on Harbaugh's Ravens staff and is coming off a two-year stint as the defensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers under Jim Harbaugh, John's brother. With Minter a defensive coach, Doyle will take on a significant role in the direction of the Ravens' offense on the heels of an injury-plagued season for Jackson, a two-time MVP. The Ravens went 8-9 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2021, taking a big step back on offense in the process. Due in large part to Jackson's injuries, the Ravens finished 27th in the league with just 175.6 yards passing per game. Baltimore missed out on the NFL playoffs for the first time since 2021. \nDoyle, a former student assistant at Iowa, broke into the NFL in 2019 as an offensive assistant with the New Orleans Saints. He reunited with Sean Payton in 2023 as the tight ends coach of the Denver Broncos, a role he served in for two seasons before he was hired by Chicago. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Former UCLA star Amari Bailey, who appeared in 10 NBA games with the Charlotte Hornets, has hired a lawyer to petition the NCAA with the hopes of returning to college basketball on one more season of eligibility, according to ESPN. The 21-year-old Bailey spent one season with the Bruins before declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft. \"Right now I'd be a senior in college,\" Bailey told ESPN. \"I'm not trying to be 27 years old playing college athletics. No shade to the guys that do; that's their journey. But I went to go play professionally and learned a lot, went through a lot. So like, why not me?\"  Bailey was selected by the Hornets in the second round of the draft and logged 10 games as a rookie on a two-way contract. In that span, he averaged 2.3 points on 33.3% shooting from the field. He signed with the Brooklyn Nets in September 2024 and eventually joined the Long Island Nets of the NBA's G League. Bailey most recently spent time with the Iowa Wolves, the G League affiliate of the Minnesota Timberwolves. \nNo basketball player has ever returned to college after playing in an NBA game. \"The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any players who have signed an NBA contract,\" NCAA senior vice president of external affairs Tim Buckley told ESPN. \"Congress can strengthen NCAA rules so professional athletes cannot sue their way back to competing against college students.\"  Bailey's case will be the latest test of NCAA eligibility as several former players seek a return to the collegiate level. Alabama's Charles Bediako was recently allowed to return to the Crimson Tide after spending three years with various G League teams. \nBediako initially played at Alabama from 2021-23 before declaring for the 2023 NBA Draft, where he went undrafted. He has since appeared in games with the Austin Spurs, Grand Rapids Gold and Motor City Cruise. A key point in Bediako's argument for eligibility is that he is within the NCAA's five-year window for eligibility. The clock started when he enrolled at Alabama as a freshman in the 2021-22 season, and the 2025-26 season marks Year 5 on his clock. Bediako's representation argues that, since Bediako never appeared in an actual NBA game, he should be allowed to return for a fifth year of eligibility. Bediako has already appeared in two games for Alabama this season. He played 25 minutes and scored 13 points in a loss to Tennessee and appeared for 18 minutes with 14 points in a win against Missouri.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Business is booming for the NFL. And if you need any evidence of that, just look at how rapidly the salary cap has increased over the last decade. Ahead of the 2026 season, the salary cap will break $300 million for the first time, NFL Network reported Friday, as the league's financial explosion continues.The NFL has informed its clubs that the 2026 salary cap will land anywhere between $301.2 million and $305.7 million next season. That will be an increase of more than $20 million from one season to the next, and that hasn't been unusual in recent years. The cap has increased nearly $100 million since 2022, when it was set at $208.2 million.Going back over a decade, the NFL salary cap has risen exponentially with the only period of contraction coming during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the cap dipped from $198.2 million to $182.5 million, but the numbers have ballooned in each subsequent season.\nYou can thank the NFL's lucrative TV rights deals with its broadcast partners for these huge upticks, this trend doesn't seem like it'll stop anytime soon. This increase should only help teams who are up against a cap crunch, and it will provide more ammo to teams who already are loading up the money cannon in anticipation of free agency.\nPerhaps no one is happier about seeing the salary cap cross the $300 million mark than this year's crop of pending free agents, headlined by players like George Pickens and Trey Hendrickson who are set to command massive paydays.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers have officially signed coach Matt LaFleur to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced Friday. Terms were not disclosed. The extension comes after reports that LaFleur's future in Green Bay was uncertain following a 31-27 wild-card loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFL Playoffs.The Packers also announced multi-year contract extensions for general manager Brian Gutekunst and executive vice president/director of football operations Russ Ball. Gutekunst joined the Packers in 1999 and worked his way up to general manager in 2018. Ball has 38 years of NFL experience, including the last 19 with the Packers. \"We are excited to extend our commitment to Brian, Matt and Russ as the leaders of our football operations. Their steadfast dedication, passion and collaboration have remained constant in our drive to compete at the highest level,\" Packers president and CEO Ed Policy said. \"While we are all disappointed with the way this season ended, we remain aligned in purpose and have spent considerable time over the past weeks collaborating on a path forward. I am exceedingly confident we have the right people to achieve our goal. The entire Packers organization looks forward to supporting every effort to bring our community and fans another championship that they very much deserve.\"LaFleur is 76-40-1 in Green Bay with six postseason appearances in seven years -- with a 3-6 overall record in the playoffs. The coach said after the loss in Chicago that he wanted to remain with the Packers. Green Bay conceded an 18-point lead in the second half despite four touchdown passes from franchise quarterback Jordan Love.LaFleur was adamant that he wanted to remain with the Packers. \n\"Of course [I want to return]. This is one of one,\" LaFleur said. \"I love this place. I love the people. As much as you guys drive me nuts sometimes, I love you guys. I love our players, the locker room, everybody in our organization. I mean, this is a unique place. The community has been outstanding.\"Love gave LaFleur his seal of approval after the Packers' ill-fated fourth quarter against the Bears, who scored 25 points in the final frame to win.\"Yeah, I definitely think Matt should be the head coach. I've got a lot of love for Matt. I think he does a great job. And that's it,\" Love said.\nLaFleur is currently the Packers' fourth-winningest coach with 76 victories, trailing only Vince Lombardi (89), Mike McCarthy (125) and Curly Lambeau (209). His 76 regular-season wins are tied for the second-most by a coach in his first seven seasons in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Paul Brown.\n            ",

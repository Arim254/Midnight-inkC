    "body": "\n        After spending last week Down Under, UFC returns to its home base of Las Vegas with UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira on Saturday. The preliminary card got underway at 5 p.m. ET, with the main card set to begin around 8 p.m. ET from the Meta Apex, and it will stream on Paramount+. The main event will feature a bantamweight bout between two ranked contenders as No. 9 Mario Bautista (16-3) will face No. 11 Vinicius Oliveira (23-3).

Riding an undefeated streak of nearly four years, Horiguchi is the -360 favorite as he looks to improve upon his No. 8 ranking, and the bout's over/under for total rounds is 2.5 (-280/+210).

It also got off to a hot start for the new era of UFC on Paramount+, hitting both Justin Gaethe to win outright (+195) and the Over in total rounds in the main event at UFC 324.Now, the model has analyzed Bautista vs. Oliveira               from every angle and revealed its top betting picks and best bets. Head to SportsLine to see them. \nBautista vs. Oliveira   preview Bautista, 32, should have the locals in his corner come Saturday as he's a Nevada native but is fighting out of Scottsdale, Ariz. His background is in BJJ, and he began his professional MMA career in 2017. He made his UFC debut two years later, and after splitting his first four bouts with the promotion, he then ripped off a lengthy winning streak. Bautista won eight straight fights, which included a victory over UFC Hall of Famer, Jose Aldo, in 2024.The eighth victory then came in his next fight before the streak ended with a decision defeat to Umar Nurmagomedov in October 2025. That was the first decision loss of Bautista's 19-match career, as he also has a lone defeat via knockout and one via submission. Most of his victories have come via submission or the scorecards as he hasn't won by knocking out his opponent in any of his last 10 bouts, despite posting an 8-2 record. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 30-year-old Oliveira hails from Brazil and won each of his first 10 pro MMA fights in the first round, eight coming with a knockout. He'd then suffer losses in two of his next three bouts but has rebounded since and been nearly unbeatable. In his dozen fights since then, which span nearly seven years, Oliveira sports an 11-1 record. He won via first-round KO in Dana White's Contender Series in 2023 to earn a UFC contract, and he's won his four bouts with the promotion.\nOver the span of those four, Oliveira has been awarded Fight of the Night twice and Performance of the Night once. With a 70.5-inch reach, the Brazilian is a knockout specialist as 16 of his 23 wins have come via the KO, compared to five from a decision and two via submission. Oliveira has never submitted in his MMA career, nor loss via the judges, as all three of his defeats have come via knockout. You can only see the model's UFC picks and analysis at SportsLine. UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira   predictionsOne of the model's top UFC Fight Night picks: It is backing Julius Walker at +130 (8.3% edge) against Dustin Jacoby (-155).\"Jacoby's experience is reflected in the betting line, but Walker's metrics suggest this fight is much closer than the odds imply. Walker lands with higher accuracy, absorbs less damage, and carries legitimate knockout upside. The SportsLine model projects Jacoby to win just 53.2% of the time, making the underdog price on Walker particularly attractive given his finishing potential,\" McClure told SportsLine. See who else to back here. \nYou can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your first $5+ bet wins. How to make UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira   picksThe model has picks for Bautista vs. Oliveira   and other bouts on the UFC card.

    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -230 money line favorites (risk $230 to win $100), while the Patriots are +190 underdogs. Darnold is the +120 favorite to win Big Game MVP, with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye second at +240. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jeremy Fears Jr. made history but didn't make any new friends in Big Ten country Saturday. The Michigan State point guard etched himself in Spartan lore with a 26-point, 15-assist showing to help No. 10 MSU outlast No. 5 Illinois 85-82 in an overtime thriller.For a program that has housed legendary point guards like Magic and Cleaves and Cassius and Valentine, it's Fears who will stand alone as the first Michigan State player ever to notch multiple 15-dime games. He did it in the last two weeks.The same 14-day span where Fears has turned into a legitimate All-American contender and one of college basketball's biggest villains after numerous acts that span between reckless, shady and downright dirty. \n        \n            \n                College basketball scores, winners and losers: North Carolina, Kentucky, Alabama rally to win rivalry games\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFears attempted to trip Michigan star Yaxel Lendeborg on Jan. 30 in a move that Wolverines coach Dusty May dubbed intentional. He kicked Minnesota's Langston Reynolds in the groin in Michigan State's 76-73 loss in a move that earned him a technical, a tongue-lashing from Tom Izzo and a warning that he might not even start against Illinois. \nBut on gameday, Fears was back in the starting five and involved in another controversy. Fears drew 14 fouls, but it was a play that didn't earn a whistle that had Illinois' bench riled up. Fears appeared to trip Illini big man David Mirkovic on a runout in the open floor, but after review, it was not upgraded to a flagrant foul.\"There was nothing on the trip, they looked at it,\" Illinois coach Brad Underwood said in the postgame press conference. \"It's always going to be a judgmental thing. He stops. It's what he does. But yeah, he was terrific. We didn't do a very good job of squaring him up. He plays with great speed and pace. I was disappointed in the fact that we fouled him that much. He's not a very good shooter, and we wanted him to have to shoot the ball in even if it was a layup. He's crafty, he's smart and did a nice job tonight.\"\nThis saga feels far from over, but one thing is clear: Fears' debt to his team has been repaid.\nHis actions against Minnesota objectively cost his team the game, but the Spartans don't beat the big, bad Illini without him. \"To be honest, it was kind of rough,\" Fears told Fox in a postgame, on-court interview. \"That's not my character. That's not who I am. I want to be able to help my team. I wasn't able to help my team in the last few games. I wanted to help my team get the win today. No matter what.\"Fears scored 22 of his 26 after halftime, including a remarkable 11 points in overtime. Illinois battled brilliantly in the Breslin Center until the very last second, showing it has what it takes to be heard from in the chase for a Big Ten Championship and a Final Four, but it could not defend without fouling in the final moments. For Fears, drawing fouls is an art of sorts, even if it drives the opposition into a tizzy (or to another swig from the bottle). \nFears told CBS Sports at Big Ten Media Days that he studies the rulebook intently, trying to understand and/or uncover any tricks of the trade that will get him to the free throw line. He shot 13 more free throws in Saturday's victory, bringing his season total to a whopping 148. It's the fifth time this season that Fears has double-digit attempts from the charity stripe, and no Big Ten player is drawing more fouls per 40 minutes than Fears (7.2), according to KenPom.com\"This team has confidence in each other; we've played bad, we got controversy, distractions,\" Izzo said. \"The best way to stick ahead is avoid dirtbags and distractions.\"Let the bobbing and weaving begin even more because the microscope on Fears isn't going away.\nSomewhere, in another life, Fears just toed the free-throw line yet again.Cash.\n            ",

After trailing by as many as 13 points in the second half, No. 14 North Carolina rallied down the stretch to secure a dramatic 71-68 win over No. 4 Duke after star guard Seth Trimble knocked down a 3-pointer before the buzzer sounded. But the drama was hardly over.After Trimble hit his shot, the clock showed nothing but zeros and North Carolina fans stormed the court. Following a video review, it was determined there was time remaining on the clock (0.4 seconds) for Duke. That meant all the fans had to be cleared off the court before they stormed it again when the game was (officially) final.In the midst of the court storm(s), Duke coach Jon Scheyer described the situation as a \"scary ending\" while saying that members of his staff got \"punched in the face.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Anatomy of a comeback: How UNC overcame its largest deficit in 25 years vs. Duke to stun Blue Devils\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's hard to talk about the game when I was most concerned for the safety of our players,\" Scheyer said in his postgame press conference. \"I don't wanna make it about that because Carolina, they played a great game to win. And that's a heartbreaking loss for our team. I got staff members that got punched in the face. My family, pushing people away trying to not get trampled. That's not what this game is about. ... That was a scary ending.\"\nNorth Carolina athletic director Bubba Cunningham apologized after the game for the court storming and confirmed at least one person was injured.\"Rivalry games are tremendous,\" Cunningham said. \"Court stormings are absolutely fabulous. It's really tough. I feel for our event staff. When they rushed the court, a number of people got knocked over. But then we had to clear the court again. So, when we normally have something like just rushing the court when the game is over we do have a line by the benches to get people off safely. Again, I apologize to (Scheyer), his family and obviously if someone got injured, that's really disappointing.\"\nThis weekend wasn't the first time Duke has been on the wrong side of a court storming. In 2024, former Duke star Kyle Filipowski injured his knee after Wake Forest fans rushed to the center of the floor following an upset win. \n            \n    ",

Gore spent parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball. While he logged just 85 total plate appearances in those eight seasons with the Royals, Cubs, Dodgers, and Mets, his elite speed and base-running smarts made him a bench weapon in three different postseasons. For his career, Gore batted .216/.310/.270 with 43 stolen bases in 52 attempts and time spent at all three outfield positions. In the playoffs, Gore played in 11 games, each time as a pinch-runner. While he batted just twice in postseason play, he also stole five bases in six attempts and scored three runs. One of those runs came in Game 2 of the 2014 World Series, a series that the Royals eventually lost to the Giants in seven games. The next year, Gore earned a World Series ring as a member of those same Royals, the team that originally drafted him with a 20th-round selection in 2011. Gore was also a member of the Dodgers in 2020 and, for a time, on their playoff roster, but he did not appear in a playoff game during Los Angeles' run to the title in that COVID-abbreviated season. As well, Gore appeared in a playoff game for the Braves in 2021, when they went on to win the World Series. \nA Georgia native, Gore attended college in Panama City, Florida. According to MLB.com, Gore is survived by his wife and three children, who live in Panama City. At the time of his passing, Gore was working as a baseball trainer and also coaching his son's youth team. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Super Bowl is the most-watched television program every year, and people are not just turning into the game. The halftime show is also a major draw to the event. This year, in between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks battling for the Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl LX, Bad Bunny will take the stage to entertain football fans, and casual fans, around the world.The game and halftime show, will take place in Santa Clara, California at Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, February 8.These days, we can expect the halftime show to be a massive event, with props, dancers, musicians, lights, sometimes pyrotechnics and often special guests. But it wasn't always like that. Over the history of the Super Bowl, the halftime show has evolved and grown into a spectacle that is one of the most highly anticipated musical performances each year.Throughout the 59 Super Bowls, there have been bands, pop singers, rappers and surprise guests take the stage in front of a stadium full of fans. Wild stunts, visual effects and props are often used to make the performances stand out. \nThere are many options to choose from when it comes to the most wild, exciting and iconic moments, but we did our best to put together some of the best of the best ahead of Super Bowl LX.10. Destiny's Child reunion (2013)Beyonce is one of the most-talked about and beloved artists of all time and is often put on a pedestal above most others. She has performed at the Super Bowl twice, the first time coming in 2013. That year, she made many '90s and early '00s pop fans dreams come true with a Destiny's Child reunion, bringing out Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.\n9. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent share a stage, win an Emmy (2022)Getting this many hip-hop and R&B legends on one stage, and not just any stage the biggest stage, was iconic in and of itself. This was one of the most exciting Super Bowl halftime shows, with energy that could be felt from the television. The 2022 SoFi Stadium performance was received so well that it went on to win an Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), marking the first-ever halftime show to win in the category.\n\n        \n            \n                Every Super Bowl halftime performer ever: Full list as Bad Bunny headlines Super Bowl LX in 2026\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n8. Michael Jackson stands still (1993)Jackson is known as one of the greatest performers of his generation and his presence was so powerful that he would often stand motionless on the stage and still receive the loudest of cheers. The \"King of Pop\" put his star power to the ultimate test during the 1993 Super Bowl, beginning his set by standing absolutely still for well over a minute. Performers do not get much time on the halftime stage, so most use every minute to its maximum capacity, but M.J. knew he would make an impact even without singing a word.\n7. Left Shark (2015)Even if you do not remember many details about Katy Perry's halftime show performance, you probably remember Left Shark becoming an instant viral meme. The person in the shark costume decided now was their chance to make their mark on the halftime show and earn their fame, and they did just that. The seemingly off-the-cuff dance moves will go down in halftime history.6. Rihanna's pregnancy revealed (2023)Performing the Super Bowl halftime show is a lot of pressure and takes dedication, time, lots of planning and the stamina to keep up with the fast pace while singing. This year, Rihanna performed the halftime show while pregnant, adding an extra layer of difficulty to an already impressive career highlight. This was the first-ever halftime show pregnancy announcement, and will go down as a memorable moment. Rihanna performed on floating stages with her special guest, though it was not the guest people were predicting. She also did the entire halftime performance alone, something that is becoming more rare, and fit 12 songs into the setlist. \n5. Lady Gaga jumping from the roof (2017)Lady Gaga certainly knows how to make an entrance. The jump at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas was prerecorded, but the live impact was still there. It was far from the most graceful dive, but that almost made it even better and so Lady Gaga.\n4. U2 honoring 9/11 victims (2002)This was by far the most emotional halftime performance to date. The game was a few months after Sept. 11 and U2 took the opportunity and the stage to honor those lost in the tragedy. The 2002 show included a screen that showed the names of the victims. While the halftime show is often an upbeat celebration, the band recognized the moment and appropriately delivered a powerful performance.3. 'Indiana Jones' performance (1995)Patti LaBelle, Tony Bennett and actors portraying an \"Indiana Jones\" scene brought a performance that was slightly confusing, but epically entertaining. The 1995 performance had the typically \"Indiana Jones\" imagery and props, while mixing in some football aspects, including setting someone on fire and the actors holding up a replica Lombardi Trophy. It was perfectly chaotic.\n2. Diana Ross leaves in a helicopter (1996)There have been some incredible entrances to the halftime show stage, but Diana Ross owns the title for best exit. When her set was over, she took off in a helicopter. She sat with open arms in the open cabin and it not only was a wild moment, but also looked pretty dangerous. 1. Janet Jackson wardrobe mishap (2004)The most well known and infamous halftime moment is the one featuring Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake. During the performance -- which also featured Kid Rock, P. Diddy and Nelly  Jackson -- Timberlake removed a piece of Janet's clothing, exposing her breast in a moment that will debated and discussed for years to come. Eighteen years later, Timberlake even penned an apology to Jackson for the scandalous moment.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are the main attraction when Super Bowl LX kicks off in two days, but the roster of singers on Super Bowl Sunday are all stars in their own right. In addition to the announcement of Bad Bunny being named the featured halftime performer months ago, we know that Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones have been added to the list of singers for the big game on Sunday, February 8.The pregame entertainment will come ahead of the 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff on NBC and Peacock at Levi's Stadium, and the halftime show will be after 30 minutes of play.\"Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them -- alongside our extraordinary deaf performers -- on Super Bowl LX's world stage,\" said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. \"This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.\" The Bad Bunny announcement followed months of rumors and predictions, and was made in a subtle way back at the end of September. Headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the top singing gigs of the year, and this was how the 31-year-old singer made the announcement on social media. \nThe Puerto Rican singer is the most-streamed artist in the world. Bad Bunny has 16 Grammy nominations, with six wins. His first three Grammy wins were for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album for YHLQMDLG, Best Musica Urbana Album for El Último Tour Del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti. He also took home one of the biggest awards, Album of the Year, at last week's Grammys for DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. It was the first Spanish-language album to win the award.Some of his other awards include the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist, the BET Award for Single of the Year for his hit song \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and J Balvin and Billboard Top Latin.Bad Bunny's top songs are \"Vete,\" \"Titi Me Pregunto,\" \"Que Pasaria\" and \"BAILE INoLIDABLE.\" \nUsually the special guests are announced closer to the championship game. One early guess for a special guest is Cardi B, who is also connected to the NFL because she recently gave birth to a boy, the son of Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs. Rapper Kendrick Lamar, who brought out multiple special guests including SZA and Serena Williams, was last year's headliner. Some other iconic halftime performers include Prince, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few. The halftime show become a cultural moment for the masses as it is typically the most-watched performance of the year. Here's a look at who will perform each pregame song on Sunday:\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"Charlie Puth and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the national anthem ahead of the big game. Puth is a multi-award winning and multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer. His hits include \"See You Again,\" \"Attention\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore.\" Beam is a actor, dancer, poet, educator, choreographer, director and visual artist.\n\"America the Beautiful\"Brandi Carlile and Deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will perform \"America the Beautiful.\" Carlile has an impressive resume that includes an Oscar nomination, two Emmy wins and a book that reached No. 1 on The New York Times' bestsellers list. \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" will be performed by Coco Jones and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam. Jones has quickly made a name for herself in R&B music, with eight Grammy nominations. Her hit \"ICU\" is platinum certified. She is an actress as well as a musician.The 60th edition of the Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, on NBC. The backdrop of the game and performances will be Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Davis won't be appearing in another NBA game until the 2026-27 season, as he's expected to be sidelined for the rest of this year to focus on getting healthy from hand and groin issues, per Chris Haynes.Davis was traded by the Dallas Mavericks to the Washington Wizards on Feb. 4 in what was a shocking move given the lackluster return Dallas got for him. However, it was clear the Mavs were selling low on Davis in an effort to fast track the Cooper Flagg era. It closed a chapter where Davis' presence served as a painful reminder of what Dallas gave up -- Luka Doncic -- to get him in the first place.\n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis trade grades: Mavericks, Wizards both make questionable decisions in deadline puzzler\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDavis will now join another rebuilding team in the Wizards, though we won't see the newly formed duo of him and Trae Young (who Washington also acquired ahead of the deadline) until next season. Davis has been out since Jan. 10 after suffering ligament damage in his left hand, so it was expected that he would continue to miss some time. However, while he was still with the Mavericks, the team's phrasing suggested he could return this season. There were even conflicting reports about Davis needing surgery to repair the ligament damage. Ultimately, after seeking a second opinion, he opted not to, which left the door open for a return at the end of February or March.Now, though, it appears the Wizards aren't chancing any further injury risk to their new star forward. Although we won't see Davis in game action until next season, he's already trying to set the record straight before even taking the court.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the trade, there was some suggestion that Davis wouldn't be happy to be joining the Wizards. Given Washington hasn't made the playoffs in five years and has only made it past the first round four times in the last 26 years, certainly one could assume that an aging 10-time All-Star who still wants to compete for championships wouldn't be enthused by the idea.But Davis is focusing on the positives as he joins a Wizards team that wants to compete next season.\"The visit's been great,\" Davis said of his first visit with the Wizards via The Athletic. \"They definitely welcomed me with open arms, spent some time with [team owner] Ted [Leonsis] and [president] Zach [Leonsis]. It's totally different from what they make it seem. I know it's like, 'Oh, they have the stigma of they're not a good team.' I haven't seen the practice facility yet, but the arena is top notch, world class for sure. Seen the chefs and how they take care of the families. It's been great.\"When asked about the outside assumption that he was unhappy with where he landed in the trade, Davis said, \"They said I said a lot of stuff in the other city, too, that I didn't say.\"But as far as his long-term future with the Wizards, Davis isn't making any sort of commitments or promises just yet.\n\"It's hard to say [I would definitely stay in D.C.] without the proper plan,\" Davis said. \"Obviously, it's tough right now with the team. It shows with their record, but adding certain pieces that can change. It's year by year. They just beat the No. 1 team in the East.\"Davis has two years left on his current contract, including a $62.7 million player option for the 2027-28 season. One of the reasons that the Mavericks traded Davis was because they weren't too keen on extending the oft-injured big man who will be 34 by the time his current contract is up. Davis has been seeking an extension, and reports prior to the trade indicated that his agent, Rich Paul, would've preferred Davis be traded elsewhere, as he believed the Mavericks weren't going to give him one.But now that Davis has been traded to the Wizards, a team not exactly associated with a winning culture, talks about an extension may be put on the back burner. At least until Davis sees Washington is committed to building a contending team.\n\"I need to talk with [general manager] Will Dawkins, Ted, Zach, and kind of figure out what the actual plan is, and then just kind of go from there,\" Davis said. \"I talked briefly [Friday] with Will. Obviously, at this time, every year, you want to compete for championships and stuff like that. That's obviously the main focus, getting to that place. Conversations are going to be held to see about getting to that space. I've been everywhere the last two years. I want to see the plan, hear the plan, see the vision. Bringing Trae [Young] here and other things in store, what they're thinking of doing, I want to have those conversations with them and see what happens. The city is obviously phenomenal.\"On paper, the Wizards will certainly have a better product on the floor next year than they do currently. The pick-and-roll partnership between Davis and Young should create a potent offense, and having Davis to mentor Alex Sarr should do wonders for his continued development. But as it has been for the last few seasons with Davis, all of that will greatly depend on his health. At his peak, Davis is one of the best two-way big men in the league. An All-Defensive forward who can easily give you 20+ points on the other end. But we haven't seen that version of him since he was traded to Dallas. Perhaps another change of scenery will get him back to his All-Star, All-Defensive ways, and he and Young can lead the Wizards to the playoffs next season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons are barreling toward another quarterback reset, and this one may finally bring clarity -- not just for the future of the position, but for Kirk Cousins' next act as well. According to ESPN, the Falcons are expected to release Cousins before the start of the new league year in March, a move that would allow the veteran quarterback to choose his next destination -- or decide whether he wants one at all -- while reopening the quarterback picture in Atlanta.That uncertainty looms especially large for Michael Penix Jr., the 2024 first-round pick who is recovering from a torn left ACL suffered in November. With a new front office and coaching staff now in place, Atlanta has yet to commit to Penix as its long-term starter, making Cousins' contractual situation one of the first dominoes to reportedly fall in defining the position's future.Atlanta recently restructured Cousins' contract in a way that made a breakup feel inevitable. His 2026 base salary was slashed from $35 million to $2.1 million, with the remaining $32.9 million pushed into 2027. That 2027 salary balloons to $67.9 million and becomes fully guaranteed if Cousins is still on the roster when the league year begins in mid-March. The Falcons, not surprisingly, are expected to avoid that scenario.Releasing Cousins gives Atlanta financial flexibility and gives Cousins something he has long valued: control. Few quarterbacks have navigated free agency better than the 37-year-old, who has consistently landed fully guaranteed deals. Whether that market still exists is an open question, but Cousins is expected to be open to continuing his playing career, while also weighing television opportunities -- including a postseason appearance on NFL on CBS -- and even retirement.\nOn the field, Cousins' stint in Atlanta was uneven but not ineffective. He completed 61% of his passes for 1,721 yards with 10 touchdowns and five interceptions this past season, going 5-3 in his starts. In 2024, Cousins opened the year as Atlanta's starter and made 14 starts before eventually ceding the job to Penix.That instability carried into 2025, when Penix started nine games before his season-ending knee injury forced Cousins back into the lineup. The Falcons went 3-6 with Penix under center, a split that only added to the questions facing the new regime.Those questions intensified after the Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot following a second straight 8-9 season. Atlanta hired Kevin Stefanski as coach and Ian Cunningham as general manager under new president of football Matt Ryan, who spent 14 seasons with the franchise and led it to a Super Bowl LI appearance. \nPenix has said he expects to be ready for the 2026 season opener, but Ryan has been careful not to anoint him the starter.\"Neither of us are the head coach of the football team, so we can't answer your question on that,\" Ryan said earlier this week while introducing general manager Ian Cunningham. \"But I think all of us are going to get together. Ian's been a part of it for, I guess, three days, and has had a lot on his plate during that time. I think as we start to get into this process and dive deeper into the roster, how it currently stands, where it's going in the future, I think those are conversations that'll be a part of it.\"Cousins' release would formally reopen the quarterback door in Atlanta. For Penix, it means opportunity paired with uncertainty. For Cousins, it means freedom. And for the Falcons, it underscores how unresolved the most important position on the roster remains, even as one expensive chapter appears ready to close.\n            ",

Anthony, who is averaging 8.9 points and 1.6 rebounds during the 2025-26 season, has appeared in 23 games (two starts) and has been the Orange's leading scorer off the bench.Despite that, Anthony didn't play in the key ACC matchup against the Cavaliers. The reason why? It was the decision of Syracuse coach Adrian Autry, who stated that the reason Anthony didn't play was not due to an injury.\"It was my decision,\" Autry said. \"This is a physical team, experienced team and it was just my decision. Nothing else. No injuries or anything like that. No narratives about any of this stuff. Again, I made a decision that was my decision today.\"\nAnthony not playing for the first time this season comes days after he logged just 16 minutes against North Carolina earlier this week. In that game against the Tar Heels during an 87-77 loss, Anthony scored 10 points, which was the fourth-most on the team behind Donnie Freeman, Naithan George and J.J. Starling. Syracuse trailed by as many as 32 points before cutting the deficit to six in the final minute.The elder Anthony likely isn't going to be to happy wit the latest development after he appeared to voice his frustration after his alma mater lost to UNC earlier this week. He commented \"SMFH\" on a post from the official Syracuse basketball account on Instagram after the Orange lost to UNC 87-77 on Monday.\nSyracuse sits at 13-11 overall (4-7 ACC) after the loss to Virginia. The Orange are tracking to miss the NCAA Tournament for the fifth consecutive season.\n            \n    ",

I'm looking forward to getting things worked out so George can be a Cowboy [for] a long time.\"Pickens was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft. After three productive seasons in Pittsburgh, he was traded to Dallas.\nThis past season, Pickens had the best year of his career, catching 93 passes for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns as the Cowboys went 7-9-1 and missed the playoffs. He was selected for the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career.Pickens' counterpart, fellow elite receiver CeeDee Lamb recently said that he would have no problem should Pickens end up with a larger contract than his own.\n\"I don't care about that, I just want my man to get what he deserves,\" Lamb said during Super Bowl radio row. \"As for me, I know I'm good. I'm fine. Me and my family, we're straight, and I just want to compete at the highest level and I want to compete for a ring. \"The money will come if you play good, so just play good and let everything else take care of itself. As for GP, he's well deserving. He deserves every penny that he gets. And if he gets more than me, I'm going to congratulate him on that.\"\n            \n    ",

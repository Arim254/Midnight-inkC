    "body": "\n        December football begins with an NFL Week 13 clash on 'Monday Night Football' as the New York Giants visit the New England Patriots. The Pats (10-2) are riding a nine-game win streak and most recently knocked off Cincinnati, 26-20, last Sunday. The Giants (2-10) have a streak of their own -- a six-game losing streak -- with the last of those being a 34-27 overtime loss to Detroit in Week 12. Jaxson Dart has been cleared to return after missing the last two games with a concussion. The Pats list outside linebacker Harold Landry (knee) as questionable. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The all-time series between the franchises is tied 7-7, with the Giants winning the last matchup in 2023. New England is the 7.5-point favorite in the latest Patriots vs. Giants odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 46.5.

Jameis Winston had the same number of turnovers (three) as touchdowns during his two starts, compared to Dart who had 13 total touchdowns versus just two giveaways over his previous five starts. The Giants have gone 6-3 against the spread over their last nine games, with Dart the signal caller for most of that stretch.

The Patriots' defense is also miles ahead of New York's, as the former ranks second in run defense and fourth in points allowed.

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos and Washington Commanders meet in the penultimate game on the Week 13 schedule as they play on 'Sunday Night Football' at 8:20 p.m. ET. With Denver bringing an elite defense into this game and Washington quarterback Jayden Daniels (elbow) ruled out, the over/under is down to 43.5 after opening at 45.5. Further making life difficult for Washington receivers, Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) is back in the lineup for the Broncos.How should those injury updates impact your NFL DFS picks for 'Sunday Night Football,' and which sleepers should you insert into your NFL DFS lineups? The likes of Troy Franklin, Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Zach Ertz could be low-cost additions to your daily Fantasy football strategy.

Nix is not a quarterback known for putting up Fantasy numbers, but he is coming off a 295-yard day against the Chiefs in his last game. The Commanders, meanwhile, have given up the third most Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season, making this an ideal spot for Nix to return value. See who else to roster at SportsLine.McClure is also building his 'Sunday Night Football' NFL DFS strategy around Washington receiver Terry McLaurin. He does not have an injury designation, clearing the way for him to play for the first time since Oct. 27. He's a veteran presence that backup quarterback Marcus Mariota can depend on. With the Commanders listed as underdogs, there's a great chance they'll need to throw late, giving McLaurin plenty of opportunities to pile up production. McLaurin had 54 yards and a touchdown in the last game he played, and he also had the same stat line of 54 yards and a score when he last played the Broncos. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Broncos vs. Commanders NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Sunday Night Football'.

    "description": "\n        Just minutes before the current collective bargaining agreement was set to expire, the WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Assoc",
    "body": "\n        Just minutes before the current collective bargaining agreement was set to expire, the WNBA and the Women's National Basketball Players Association agreed to a 40-day extension, the league announced Sunday night. The new expiration date for the current CBA is Friday, Jan. 9, 2026. Either party can terminate the extension at any point with a 48-hour notice. This is the second time that the current CBA has been extended. It was originally set to expire on Oct. 31, but days before that deadline the two sides agreed to a 30-day extension that pushed the expiration date back to Nov. 30. There was little movement -- at least publicly -- over the last 30 days, and it seemed as though the two sides may be heading for a status quo period until their last-minute extension late on Sunday night. Extensions are not a new phenomenon in CBA negotiations. In fact, the two sides needed a 60-day extension to come to terms on the current CBA, which was not ratified until January of 2020. It appears as though the ongoing negotiations could follow a similar timeline. WNBA's most recent offer didn't move the needleIn November, the WNBA made a new offer to the players that included substantial salary increases, including a new minimum salary (more than $220,000) that would be more than the 2025 regular max salary ($214,466), according to the Associated Press. However, the players did not believe that offer moved negotiations forward, per ESPN. \n\n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: League's latest offer would raise minimum salary above 2025 maximum, per report\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the players want more money, a new revenue-sharing model is their top priority, not just higher salaries. \"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share [and] salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. \nCurrently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the WNBA's latest offer reportedly included a revenue sharing component, ESPN's report indicated that the players were still not satisfied with how the salary cap, and thus player salaries, would grow. What happens next?There are four paths forward from here. Let's quickly run through them:1. A new CBAThe ideal outcome would be a new CBA. The sooner the two parties can come to terms on a new CBA, the sooner the offseason can commence. While the draft lottery was finally held late last month -- the Dallas Wings won the No. 1 pick for the second year in a row -- none of the other major offseason activities can take place until a new CBA is ratified. \nA new CBA by Jan. 9 would also ensure that the 2026 season can start on time, which is extremely important for the continued growth of the league. 2. Another extension to the current CBAIf, for some reason, the two sides still cannot agree to a deal by Jan. 9, they could negotiate another extension. While that would not be ideal, it would be better than the risk of a work stoppage. 3. A status quo periodIf Jan. 9 passes without a new CBA or another extension, there would not automatically be a work stoppage. Instead, the two sides would enter a status quo period, which appears to be the most likely next step. \nPer the Cornell Law Review: \"Courts developed the 'status quo' doctrine from the Katz prohibition of unilateral changes. This doctrine requires employers 'to maintain, during ther period of negotiations, the status quo concerning conditions of employment in order to avoid committing [a violation of the duty to bargain in good faith].'\"The key difference between status quo and an extension is that either side could announce a work stoppage at any point during status quo, while an extension would lock in the current CBA until a set date (or until a new CBA is agreed upon).4. A work stoppageAt any point during a status quo period, either side could enact a work stoppage. That would most likely come via the owners locking out the players, though the players could also go on strike. \nIn the event of a lockout, all league business would cease and players would be prevented from accessing team facilities. That would mean no expansion draft, no free agency, no trades, no 2026 WNBA Draft, nothing until a new CBA is in place. Depending on how long the lockout lasted, it's possible that the 2026 season could be delayed or, in a worst-case scenario, cancelled. The WNBA has never lost games due to a work stoppage. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State is hiring Pat Fitzgerald to fill its coaching vacancy, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. The Spartans acted quickly to replace former coach Jonathan Smith, who was fired Sunday afternoon after two seasons in East Lansing. Fitzgerald was initially reported as a top target in Michigan State's search. This will mark a return to the Big Ten for the 50-year-old coach, who spent 17 seasons at Northwestern from 2006-22. He has not coached at the collegiate level since. Fitzgerald, who was a hall of fame linebacker and a longtime defensive assistant with the Wildcats, departed Evanston with a 110-101 overall record. His 110 wins and 64 Big Ten conference wins were both program records. As were his 10 bowl appearance and his five wins in bowl games. Fitzgerald also became the first Northwestern coach to ever lead the Wildcats to back-to-back bowl appearances. Northwestern made it to the postseason five straight times from 2008-12 and four straight times from 2015-18. \nHe was named the 2020 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year after guiding Northwestern to a 7-2 record, including an appearance in the Big Ten Championship Game and a win against Auburn in the Citrus Bowl. The Wildcats also finished top 10 in the AP poll for the first time since 1995. Fitzgerald's tenure ended in controversy Though he had his fair share of successes at Northwestern, Fitzgerald's career with the Wildcats ended quickly. Outside of that COVID-shortened 2020 season, he won just seven games from 2019-22. Northwestern also finished with just one win in Big Ten play each year in that span except 2020. Northwestern went 1-11 in 2022 -- Fitzgerald's final season -- with losses to Miami (Ohio) and FCS Southern Illinois. Fitzgerald's 14-31 record from 2019-22 was the worst of any four-year span during his tenure. \nOn July 8, 2023, Fitzgerald was suspended without pay for two weeks after reports emerged alleging graphic incidents of hazing within the program. He was fired three days later after university administrators opted to revisit his status when The Daily Northwestern student newspaper published details of the hazing provided by two former players. Fitzgerald claimed that he was \"not aware of the alleged incidents.\" An investigation conducted by Northwestern also found that the hazing was \"well-known by many in the program,\" though it was not determined whether or not Fitzgerald knew about it. In Aug. 2025, Fitzgerald and Northwestern reached a settlement regarding the former coach's wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. \nMichigan State acts quickly Michigan State fired Smith and moved to hire Fitzgerald in a span of less than two hours. That's big for the Spartans, as it seems they had a solid plan in place with the high school early signing period approaching this week. That means Fitzgerald will have at least a couple of days to evaluate Michigan State's roster and its current recruiting class, which ranks No. 32 in the 247Sports Team Composite. That's good for 10th among Big Ten schools. He'll likely prioritize retaining the commitment of wide receiver Samson Gash, a four-star product of Novi, Michigan's Catholic Central High School. Gash is one of two four-star prospects in Michigan State's 2026 recruiting class. \nFitzgerald will also have plenty of time to assess things before the winter transfer window opens in January. He may need that time to adjust, given how long he's been out of coaching. \n            ",

However, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh revealed after the game that quarterback Justin Herbert broke a bone in his left hand, his non-throwing hand, and will undergo surgery on Monday. Herbert injured his hand on the Chargers' opening drive, which was capped by a 10-yard Quentin Johnston touchdown. The star signal-caller hurt his hand after taking a big hit from Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn, but he appeared to be OK. \nFollowing the opening scoring drive, Herbert exited the sideline and jogged to the locker room. Trey Lance took over at quarterback on L.A.'s next drive. When Herbert returned to the game that very same drive, he sported a large protective glove. \nHerbert completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception vs. the Raiders, and passed Dan Marino for the third-most passing yards (23,935) in a quarterback's first six seasons in NFL history. Los Angeles relied on its rushing attack Sunday, as Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson combined for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. \nThe first question Chargers fans will have is when will Herbert return? That remains unclear right now, although Herbert did tell reporters he's treating this week as if he's playing, per ESPN. The Chargers' next game comes in eight days against the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles on \"Monday Night Football.\" Herbert will surely be pushing to play, and will need to wear a protective device on that injured hand, but it's possible Lance could make his first start for L.A. in Week 14. \n            \n    ",

Once 3-5-1, Dallas has strung together three straight wins thanks to a defensive turnaround, and now, more defensive help is on the way. On Sunday, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer told reporters that the team has designated cornerback Trevon Diggs to return from injured reserve, and opened his 21-day practice window. Diggs has missed the past six games after he was placed on injured reserve following an accident in his home that landed him in the concussion protocol. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones referred to it as a \"fluke situation.\"\"I don't know the combination of the injury and how it impacted, regarding concussion issue, I'm not sure that I know the detail of how that happened,\" Jones said last month. \"He said what happened, and I'm not saying that didn't happen, but a lot of times, you're not the best viewer of what happened to you. … Yeah, no I won't get into that [what Diggs said happened], but the bottom line is that I do expect him back.\"\nIn six games played this season, Diggs recorded 18 combined tackles with zero passes defensed or interceptions. Diggs is a two-time Pro Bowl player, and was named a First Team All-Pro in 2021 when he led the league in interceptions with 11.The Cowboys are off this weekend after defeating Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Thanksgiving, 31-28. With that win, the Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to defeat both of the previous year's Super Bowl teams in a five-day span. In Week 12, the Cowboys overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Philadelphia Eagles. \nEntering NFL Sunday, the Cowboys are the No. 9 seed in the NFC, one spot above the 6-6 Carolina Panthers, and one behind the 7-5 Detroit Lions. Dallas is also 1.5 games back of the 8-4 Eagles in the NFC East, who lost to the Chicago Bears Friday. Up next for the Cowboys are the Lions in Detroit this Thursday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        While Lane Kiffin toyed with three programs late in the week before ultimately picking LSU, the rest of the SEC coaching board was convulsing behind the scenes. For a moment, Auburn and Arkansas believed they had their men. Then one conversation -- not involving Ole Miss -- sent the entire carousel swerving off its tracks.Everyone expected this potentially record-breaking cycle to get messy, but the speed at which things flipped late last week blindsided more than a few power brokers, industry sources told CBS Sports.Yes, Kiffin's soap-opera two-step between Ole Miss and LSU set the tone, but that wasn't the twist that ultimately pushed multiple coaches into jobs they didn't quite anticipate seven days earlier.The pivot was visible by Saturday.\nThe actual turn started midweek, when South Florida's Alex Golesh appeared close to accepting an offer from Arkansas. The sides had met, discussed contract terms, and were trending toward the finish line. But as the week unfolded, Florida sensed the ground shifting with its search. Kiffin's erratic communication convinced leaders in Gainesville that he was no longer seriously considering the Gators, so they tracked candidates already on their radar.\nAt the same time, Auburn's two- to three-week pursuit of Tulane's Jon Sumrall suddenly bogged down. Auburn officials had spoken with Sumrall and his camp repeatedly, even meeting with him in New Orleans, sources told CBS Sports. A deal felt inevitable -- until more questions surfaced from Sumrall's side about the job, staffing and other details. Auburn was caught off guard by the tenor. By Thursday night, communication halted. Auburn pivoted to two primary options: interim coach and defensive coordinator DJ Durkin, or Golesh -- who was simultaneously the frontrunner at Arkansas.But Golesh's camp cooled on the Razorbacks. So Arkansas doubled back, giving fresh looks to Memphis' Ryan Silverfield and Alabama defensive coordinator Kane Wommack. Both were interviewed multiple times by the Razorbacks' administration, and Silverfield had been high on Arkansas' board since the search opened in late September, sources said.\n        \n            \n                Lane Kiffin to LSU timeline: How the Ole Miss coach kept all of college football waiting with bated breath\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAuburn, meanwhile, braced for its fork in the road: promote Durkin, or lure Golesh with an incentive-heavy deal worth $7.4 million -- roughly $500,000 more than Arkansas initially put on the table. By Saturday afternoon, Auburn felt solid about either direction and began prepping a Sunday announcement: Durkin or Golesh.\nA win in the Iron Bowl might have sealed the full-time job for Durkin, sources said. Instead, the Tigers fell 27-20, their sixth straight loss to Alabama, prompting more late-night discussions at Auburn. Then, late in the night, a 10 a.m. team meeting was scheduled for Sunday.By this time, Florida was locked in on Sumrall and had an offer. Sources believed Friday Sumrall was set to be named the Gators' head coach on Sunday, but with a caveat: what if Kiffin shocked everyone and stayed at Ole Miss? Would LSU then pivot to Sumrall as one of its top candidates?By early Saturday, industry sources were convinced the Kiffin-Ole Miss marriage was ending, even if Kiffin was dragging his feet through red tape behind the scenes. LSU was no longer a threat for Sumrall. Auburn had moved on. \nAnd with that, the entire map shifted. Deep in the bayou at LSU and Tulane was the center pole of the coaching carousel.Auburn nearly closed on Sumrall. Arkansas nearly secured Golesh. Both discussions drifted apart. LSU's pursuit of Kiffin and Sumrall's decision to pursue Florida as talks with Auburn cooled reshaped the futures of at least five programs in a span of 72 hours. Will any of these moves work? Nobody knows. Every hire is a gamble, particularly in an era defined by NIL volatility and revenue sharing.And that's the magic of this sport. It thrives on the belief that tomorrow will be better than today.\nWhat we do know: every school will now claim they hired their top choice. In this sport, that's rarely true, but it's always the sales pitch.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Despite the Cleveland Browns scoring just one touchdown in a 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, quarterback Shedeur Sanders will get another look as the starter next week against the Tennessee Titans. Coach Kevin Stefanski declined to comment on whether he locked up the role for good or if he remains in a week-to-week competition with Dillon Gabriel.The announcement came after an ESPN report stated the Browns are open to giving Sanders an \"extended look\" in the starting job. They previously gave Gabriel a six-game opportunity, but after he suffered a concussion in the last of those starts, he ceded the job to his fellow rookie.Sanders made his second career start in the loss to the 49ers and completed 16 of 25 passes for 149 yards and a touchdown. He also ran once for a 6-yard gain.\"He's battling like all of our guys are battling,\" Stefanski said of Sanders. \"I know there's plays he wants back, but we'll look at it and we'll correct it.\"\nAlthough it came in a losing effort, Sanders at times looked more comfortable running the offense than in his previous two outings. He was more accurate than in his starting debut against the Las Vegas Raiders when he went just 11 for 20, and he was dramatically more effective than his 4-for-16 relief appearance against the Baltimore Ravens.\"Obviously we lost, so I ain't play well,\" Sanders said. \"It's definitely things on film I'm gonna look back and want to get back and want to see, but at least moving forward I know what we could do differently going about the week and being able to get fully prepared for every possibility.\"Sanders, Cam Ward set for rookie duelIt will be a rookie-versus-rookie battle next week when the Browns host the Titans' No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward. Tennessee (1-11)  heads to Cleveland (3-9) on the heels of another blowout loss, this time a 25-3 defeat at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nSanders and Ward were often compared in the pre-draft process as first-round prospects. Ward lived up to expectations when he came off the board at No. 1, but Sanders experienced one of the most dramatic draft slides in recent memory when he slipped all the way to the fifth round. Neither found much success in the early going of their NFL careers.PlayerComp-AttYardsTDINTShedeur Sanders31-61 (50.1%)40522Cam Ward246-412 (59.7%)2,35176One of the quarterbacks will earn his second win of the year. A victory would give Sanders a winning record as a starter, while Ward is already in a much deeper hole with his larger sample size of 12 starts. If Sanders improves to 2-1 in his role, he could strengthen his grip on the job and distance himself from Gabriel, who logged just one win in his six opportunities atop the depth chart.\"In the midst of everything that's going on -- wins, losses, anything -- I remember when I wasn't playing,\" Sanders said. \"So I never forget that feeling. I try my best to not let that happen again, for me to be in that position.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Cleveland Browns fell to 3-9 on Sunday with a 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. There weren't many highlights from this matchup, as both teams did not cross 254 yards of total offense, but there were some fireworks after the final whistle. When Browns defensive lineman Maliek Collins went down with an injury in the third quarter and was carted off the field, 49ers wide receiver Jauan Jennings apparently took the opportunity to talk some trash. At least, that's what Browns defensive lineman Shelby Harris said. And he wants the world to know that Jennings \"Is a hoe.\" \"He's a hoe, and I want that known,\" Harris told reporters in the locker room. \"Like I see why he got punched in the nuts, because he said some things that you should not say to another man, ever. But, like, I don't respect it because you say that then run behind your O-line. That's some real soft shit, and I want that known. I see exactly why they punched him in the nuts, I'm surprised nobody punched him in the jaw yet.\"\nIf you recall, Jennings was punched below the belt by Carolina Panthers defensive back Tre'von Moehrig last Monday night. After the game, Jennings chased Moehrig down and struck him across the face. Moehrig was suspended one game without pay for his low blow. \nBrowns superstar Myles Garrett also addressed the Jennings matter during his postgame press conference, saying, \"I can't speak for how he was raised.\" His take on the issue was much more measured. \"He had a lot to say that was demeaning and disparaging towards some of our players,\" Garrett said.\nJennings caught four passes for 39 yards and a touchdown during Sunday's victory. He also apparently made a few enemies as well. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Giannis Antetokounmpo made a bold claim Saturday night after becoming the sixth-youngest player in NBA history to reach 21,000 career points. The two-time league MVP tallied 29 points in a 116-99 win over the Brooklyn Nets, bringing his point total to 21,002. Only nine active players have reached that milestone, but Antetokounmpo is reaching for a far higher goal before he retires.  The NBA champion shared that he hopes to break LeBron James' scoring record before it's all said and done.  \"I think to get to the top of the scoring list is not six, seven, eight years, I think it's -- in my opinion -- four years away,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Four, five years away. I think I'm going to be 35 years old sitting in this chair having a discussion of I am the top [of the all-time scoring list]. I would have talked that into existence. And not just talked it into existence, because I believe I'm going to do it. It's something that I want to do. But that's too far away. Four, five years from now I might have four other kids. You know, my wife might have left me, who knows four, five years from now.\" In Year 13, Antetokounmpo is about halfway to James' record of 42,250 career points and counting. But how long would it actually take the Greek Freak to surpass James? By his own account, he thinks four to five years, but that seems like a lofty goal, even for someone as dominant as he is.  \nIf Antetokounmpo wanted to reach James' current point total in the next few years, he'd have to average an incredibly unrealistic 64.7 points over the next four years, or 51.8 points over five years. And that's assuming he's playing all 82 games in each of those seasons, which is also highly unlikely. Unless he's planning on scoring every single point for the Bucks or whichever team he's on in five year's time, that's not happening. Surely Antetokounmpo wasn't thinking about the logistics of actually accomplishing that goal in the next five years, so let's break down when he could realistically reach that number.  This is all assuming that Antetokounmpo stays relatively healthy into his 30s, and given he's averaged 67.2 games played per season over his 13 years, his body shouldn't entirely break down given the health he's experienced so far. Antetokounmpo is probably the closest thing we have to James in regards to minimal health issues over their careers, as LeBron is only now starting to witness the effects of Father Time in the last couple seasons.  So let's say Antetokounmpo continues to average 67 games over the rest of his career. He needs to score 21,249 points to break James' current record. Realistically, Antetokounmpo could reach that number in 10 years, by averaging 31.7 points a game.  \nGiannis' 10-year scoring planPoints needed to pass LeBron James (as of Nov. 30)21,249 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTotal points needed per season over 10 years \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2,124.9 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tPoints per game needed (67 game average) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t31.7 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tLet's take a look at that possibility over an 11-year span. He'd need to average 28.8 points over 11 years to pass James. That seems like a more doable timeframe, especially since his career average is 24 points per game.Giannis' 11-year scoring planPoints needed to pass LeBron James (as of Nov. 30)21,249 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTotal points needed per season over 11 years \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1,931.7 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tPoints per game needed (67 game average) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t28.8 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tThe asterisk to all of this, though, is that 10 or 11 years from now, Antetokounmpo would be 41 or 42 years old. So unless he's planning on playing into his 40s like James, the thought of passing the scoring record may be out of reach. There's also the fact that James is still playing, and with every point he scores the more distance he puts between him and whoever else wants to break his record.It's not impossible for Antetokounmpo, and given he's averaged over 30 points in each of the last four years, he's on the trajectory to reach 30,000 points in at least the next five years. But breaking James' record will come down to health and how long Antetokounmpo wants to play. We could very well see him play into his 40s like James because he keeps himself in great physical shape to do so. And if this is the goal he's set out for himself before he hangs it up, then perhaps we will see him accomplish it. But for now, it seems like something that might be at bit out of reach for the future Hall of Famer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the early window of games on Sunday of Week 13 in the NFL, the New York Jets and New Orleans Saints -- both of whom had two wins headed into the day -- had opportunities to win. The Jets won on a walk-off field goal from Nick Folk whereas a late potential go-ahead drive by the Saints fell short on fourth-and-1. There are two games featuring teams with four wins or fewer next week: Titans at Browns and Commanders at Vikings. All four of those teams are in the top 10 overall range. Week 14 is also the last week of byes. The Giants have played one more game than most other teams, so next week is an equalizer of sorts. As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon) as well as potential team needs:\n1. Tennessee Titans (1-11)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEJacksonville did not play with its food Sunday as the Titans were washed away with the tide. Tennessee has a firm grip on the No. 1 overall pick with a date against the Browns next weekend. 2. New Orleans Saints (2-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans was driving with a chance to take the lead over Miami in the final minute, but the Saints failed to convert a 4th-and-1 that would have kept the drive going in Dolphins territory. 3. New York Giants (2-10)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTNew York travels to New England for \"Monday Night Football.'' Jaxson Dart is back in the driver's seat after clearing concussion protocol. \n4. Las Vegas Raiders (2-10)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTThe Raiders offense was no more threatening in a post-Chip Kelly world. Ashton Jeanty has only broken 75 rushing yards once this season. 5. Cleveland Browns (3-9)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLShedeur Sanders started the second game of his young NFL career, but, like others before him, was unable to get the Browns offense in gear.6. Washington Commanders (3-9)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington lost a heartbreaker in OT to Denver on \"Sunday Night Football.'' Jayden Daniels is said to be nearing his return to the football field, but a return to the postseason is already out of reach.  \n7. New York Jets (3-9)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TERedemption for Nick Folk! The 41-year-old converted a 56-yard field goal after the Jets had a false start earlier. 8. Arizona Cardinals (3-9)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBArizona attempted to become the latest thorn in Tampa Bay's side, but its upset bid fell short. Since winning the first two games of the season, the Cardinals have lost nine of their last 10.9. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (4-8)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta and Kirk Cousins were involved in a tightly contested affair Sunday. Their loss was Los Angeles' gain as the Rams are currently in position to pick top 10 overall. \n10. Cincinnati Bengals (4-8)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Burrow must have shaken off the rust in practice because it looked as though he was back in midseason form; earlier than scheduled. The Bengals are still on the prowl. 11. Minnesota Vikings (4-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBMax Brosmer, J.J. McCarthy, the outcome is all the same. Minnesota has failed to score 20 points or more in four straight games. 12. Miami Dolphins (5-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami has won four of its last five games, including three straight. In theory, the Dolphins still have an outside shot at the playoffs.\n13. Kansas City Chiefs (6-6)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEKansas City's playoff hopes are very much hanging in the balance after losing to Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. There is a logjam in the AFC playoff race and the Chiefs can ill afford to lose any more ground. 14. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLPittsburgh could not capitalize on Baltimore's Thanksgiving loss. The Steelers failed to score in the second half against the Bills.15. Carolina Panthers (7-6)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina has been one of the most inconsistent teams of the season. The Panthers were demolished by the Bills and lost to the Saints, but then defeated the Packers and Rams. The Panthers may be just as capable of winning every game as they are losing. \n16. Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas has won three straight games with critical victories over the Eagles and Chiefs. The Cowboys' final five games set up well for the franchise to push for the NFC playoffs. 17. Detroit Lions (7-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTSince winning four consecutive games in September and early October, the Lions have neither won nor lost back-to-back games. To continue on that trajectory, Detroit would need a win against the Cowboys on Thursday night. 18. Houston Texans (7-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SAlthough the quarterback may have been different -- C.J. Stroud returned to the starting lineup for Davis Mills -- Houston, with backs against the wall, won its fourth consecutive game as the Colts loosen their grip on the AFC South lead.\n19. Baltimore Ravens (6-6)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBBaltimore had surged to regain the AFC North lead, but Cincinnati put an end to its five-game win streak on Thanksgiving.20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TETampa Bay narrowly avoided losing its fourth consecutive game. Carolina is suddenly pushing for the NFC South title. 21. Buffalo Bills (8-4)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRThe Bills have an opportunity to achieve some positive momentum going into the playoffs.\n22. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLIn each of the past two weeks, A.J. Brown has eclipsed 100 receiving yards and in each of those two games, the Eagles have lost. Perhaps it would serve them well to have a bit less pressure on them. 23. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-4)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLJets and Browns fans are equally attentive to the AFC South race, which has suddenly drawn even with five games to play. Cleveland holds the rights to Jacksonville's first-round pick and the Jets hold Indianapolis' pick.24. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TESan Francisco did not need much to put away the Browns given its opposition's lack of offensive consistency. The 49ers were set up for an initial score by a long punt return and used a few well-timed explosives to score their remaining points. Cleveland actually outgained San Francisco, 253-252.\n25. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLJustin Herbert suffered a fractured left hand against the Raiders, but helped the Chargers continue to keep pace in the AFC playoff hunt. 26. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville has won three consecutive games and is now in the mix to win the AFC South. Sunday's outcome against the Titans was never in doubt.27. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBAlthough the jerseys may have changed, Micah Parsons continued his personal tradition of playing on Thanksgiving. His new team and former team were victorious.28. Seattle Seahawks (9-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRSam Darnold enacted revenge on his former team as Minnesota has struggled to lock in on his replacement. Three teams in the NFC West have nine wins. 29. Los Angeles Rams (9-3)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLLos Angeles' season suffered a surprising setback with Sunday's loss to the Panthers. Puka Nacua delivered a few highlight-reel moments.30. New England Patriots (10-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEThe Patriots host the Giants on \"Monday Night Football.''31. Chicago Bears (9-3)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTWith five games remaining, it is neither the Eagles, Packers, 49ers or Lions with the NFC's best record; it is the Bears (along with the Rams). Ben Johnson has revitalized what had been a self-deprecating fan base in recent years. 32. Denver Broncos (10-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTDenver escaped in OT in a wild game against Washington on \"Sunday Night Football\" and took over the No. 1 seed in the AFC in the process.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin, the top candidate of the 2025 college football coaching carousel, has decided to leave Ole Miss for LSU and will not coach in the College Football Playoff, he announced Sunday after a days-long saga. \"After a lot of prayer and time spent with family, I made the difficult decision to accept the head coaching position at LSU,\" Kiffin said on social media. Kiffin leaves Ole Miss after six seasons and a 55-19 record. Defensive coordinator Pete Golding will be named the school's new coach, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz, as the Rebels look to prevent a massive exodus with the school's first CFP appearance on the horizon. 247Sports' Neal McCready reports Ole Miss is looking to double the pay of its offensive coaches to keep them on staff. Kiffin released a statement around 2 p.m. local time Sunday laying the blame for his early exit at the feet of athletics director Keith Carter.\nI was hoping to complete a historic six season run with this year's team by leading Ole Miss through the playoffs, capitalizing on the team's incredible success and their commitment to finish strong, and investing everything into a playoff run with guardrails in place to protect the program in any areas of concern. My request to do so was denied by Keith Carter despite the team also asking him to allow me to keep coaching them so they could better maintain their high level of performance. Unfortunately, that means Friday's Egg Bowl was my last game coaching the Rebels.While I am looking forward to a new start with a unique opportunity at LSU, I will forever cherish the incredible six years I spent at Ole Miss and will be rooting hard for the team to complete their mission and bring a championship to Oxford.A decision was expected on Saturday by Kiffin after he met with athletic director Keith Carter and university administration, but both parties left the meeting without a public resolution. A team meeting was called at 9 a.m. local time on Sunday but was later pushed to 1 p.m. as the football world scrambled to fill in the blanks of Kiffin's decision and Ole Miss' next move. One of the highest-profile coaches in college football since joining the Rebels in 2020, Kiffin led the program to four 10-win seasons and three finishes of No. 11 or better in the AP Top 25. His tenure marked the most successful period at Ole Miss since integration. However, at LSU, Kiffin has the chance to elevate his resume. Three of the last four coaches in Baton Rouge have won national titles, which have been elusive to Kiffin. Additionally, Brian Kelly won an SEC West division championship in 2022 before the league moved to a divisionless format. \"I am incredibly honored to have the opportunity to lead the storied LSU Football program,\" Kiffin said in an LSU statement. \"From national championships to iconic players, LSU is synonymous with excellence and is among the most powerful brands in all of sports. I'm grateful to President Rousse, Verge Ausberry and LSU's leadership for placing their faith in me to lead this program. Our staff will recruit the very best student-athletes in the country – starting at home in the state of Louisiana -- and will work tirelessly every day to bring championships that the LSU fans deserve. Geaux Tigers!\"Kelly was fired in only his fourth season after the program invested heavily in his roster. The Tigers limped out to a 5-3 start, including a 49-25 decimation at the hands of Texas A&M. Kiffin defeated Kelly 24-19 in what appeared to be a marquee matchup in Oxford, Mississippi, but the Tigers ultimately fell from No. 4 to unranked. While Kiffin is one of the most well-traveled coaches in college football, he has never coached in the state of Louisiana. However, he worked under former Tigers coach Nick Saban at Alabama, as well as Pete Carroll at LSU. Kiffin has previous stints as head coach at Tennessee (2009), USC (2010-13) and with the Oakland Raiders (2007-08). \n\"We are thrilled to welcome Coach Kiffin as the next head coach of the LSU Football program,\" LSU athletic director Verge Ausberry said. \"We shared when we began this search that LSU would secure the best coach in the country and Lane Kiffin is just that. Lane is a proven winner who has thrived in an era of college athletics that requires coaches to adapt and innovate. His passion, creativity and authenticity make him the ideal leader to guide LSU into the future and consistently position us among the sport's elite. I want to welcome Lane and his family to Baton Rouge, and I'd like to thank our search committee, as well as our university and state leadership, for their critical support and counsel throughout this process.\"At LSU, Kiffin is tasked with bringing the Tigers back to national contention. The program has not won a national championship or SEC championship since firing coach Ed Orgeron after the 2020 season. What's next for Ole Miss?The timing of Kiffin's decision really couldn't be worse for the Rebels, who secured the program's first College Football Playoff appearance on Friday after a 38-19 win over rival Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl. \nCarter will hope to keep the current formula intact with the 41-year-old Golding, who got his first big break as the defensive coordinator and cornerbacks coach at UTSA and parlayed that into an opportunity as defensive coordinator at Alabama from 2018-22, where he coached under Nick Saban. Golding left for Ole Miss in January 2023. In August, Ole Miss made Golding the highest-paid defensive coordinator in the SEC with a three-year contract extension worth around $2.61 million annually. How does leaving now affect Kiffin's legacy?On one hand, Ole Miss fans should be thankful for Kiffin's time in Oxford. He's delivered some of the greatest seasons in program history and singlehandedly improved the Rebels' SEC outlook. To even have Ole Miss in the conversation as a consistent national contender in the modern era is a testament to Kiffin's efforts. \nOle Miss fans also have every right to be outraged. A coach abandoning a school for a perceived better opportunity stings, but it isn't unheard of; a coach abandoning a school on the precipice of its first College Football Playoff run is unprecedented, however, and it smacks of betrayal. It's reminiscent of the time, just under 16 years ago, when Kiffin suddenly left Tennessee in the cold after one season with the Vols to replace Pete Carroll at USC. Kiffin's decision precipitated Tennessee's fall into a decade of irrelevancy. There's no telling if the same thing will happen at Ole Miss, but this move is arguably worse from the onset. Kiffin gave the Rebels six seasons, the longest he's ever stayed in one place as a coach. He took the program to heights it hasn't seen since Johnny Vaught was patrolling the sidelines. \nIn an era where sustained success is harder than ever, Kiffin more than acclimated -- he thrived and molded Ole Miss into the model of a bought-in program. Now, he could use some of those same tactics to take Ole Miss' stars with him to Baton Rouge, which would plunge the dagger even further. The offseason campaign pointing towards Kiffin's growth -- professionally, at least -- rings hollow. It's fair to question whether he's motivated by anything except the almighty dollar, since winning and resources obviously weren't issues at Ole Miss. What will Kiffin inherit at LSU?Kiffin is inheriting an LSU roster that could look a lot different next year. The Tigers went all-in on building a roster meant to compete for championships in the offseason, which meant adding a lot of veterans via the transfer portal while investing significant capital into retaining top talent. \nLSU has 18 seniors or draft-eligible juniors/redshirt sophomores listed atop its depth chart. That includes standout names like quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, cornerback Mansoor Delane and safety A.J. Haulcy. Maybe Kiffin can convince a few of LSU's impact players with eligibility to come back, but there's still going to be plenty of turnover. Not that that's necessarily a problem for Kiffin, who touts the well-earned moniker of \"Portal King.\" Flipping rosters isn't anything new to him; Kiffin leaned heavily on the transfer portal to inject Ole Miss' roster with talent on a yearly basis. The Rebels landed a top-five transfer class in every cycle between 2022 -- when 247Sports started ranking transfer hauls -- and 2025. Expect much of the same at a place like LSU, which hasn't shied away from talent acquisition in recent years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss will not look to have a full scale coaching search after Lane Kiffin's departure for LSU. Instead, the  the Rebels will elevate defensive coordinator Pete Golding to the full-time position, the team announced Sunday.\"Coach Kiffin and I met yesterday, and he informed us that he is accepting the head coaching position at another school,\" Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said in a statement. \"For our program to begin preparing for its future -- both the short and long term, he will be stepping away from the team immediately. With this development, we could not be more excited to announce Pete Golding as the next head coach of the Ole Miss Rebels. His tenure will begin immediately as he leads our program in the pursuit of a national title. Today's team meeting was a clear indicator of his ability to galvanize our squad. All of our players and coaches are ecstatic and ready to lock arms for a playoff run.\"Players were told Golding would be \"the guy\" in an afternoon meeting in which they were informed officially that Kiffin was leaving for Baton Rouge. Golding has been the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach in Oxford for the past two seasons after serving in the same roles for Nick Saban at Alabama from 2018-2022 -- where he first worked with Kiffin. The most immediate question for Golding is who of the current Ole Miss staff will stay with him in Oxford, and who will leave with Kiffin for LSU. Initial reports indicated much of the offensive staff will join Kiffin, but we await official word on who exactly will be going where. \nHow Golding's hire impacts Ole Miss in the PlayoffThere are long-term concerns, but with the Rebels in the midst of their most successful season in decades, the immediate priority is keeping everything on track as they prepare for their first College Football Playoff.Golding's hire should alleviate many of the committee's questions about whether we'll see the same Ole Miss team we've seen all season. Some have compared the Rebels' situation after losing Kiffin to Florida State in 2023, when the Seminoles lost their top two quarterbacks late in the year and were left out. That was not only a unique injury scenario, but it also happened in the four-team Playoff era.An 11-1 Ole Miss shouldn't have had any concerns about making a 12-team playoff, but keeping things in-house with Golding could also help preserve a first-round home game.\nWho stays with Ole Miss and who leaves for LSU?This is a question for both coaches and players. We'll find out which of the former are joining Kiffin in Baton Rouge soon, as he reportedly told assistants they can either leave with him immediately or they won't have offers later.There's an expectation that some of the offensive staff will follow Kiffin to LSU, but Golding can still make a push to retain select Rebels assistants by offering larger roles and salaries than they'd receive in Baton Rouge. Neal McCready of 247Sports reports those offers are already being made as Ole Miss tries to hold things together as best it can.Once the CFP ends and the transfer portal opens, we'll learn how large a rebuilding job Golding will face with this roster. The Rebels were already aggressive in the portal under Kiffin, but if he's able to bring some of his top players with him to LSU, Golding's task of keeping the roster at a Playoff-caliber talent level becomes even tougher.\nThe two biggest names the programs will battle over are quarterback Trinidad Chambliss (pending an eligibility waiver) and running back Kewan Lacy. But the competition won't stop there. Expect overtures up and down the roster, especially on offense, as Kiffin looks to hit the ground running at LSU with players who already know his system.The portal window will mark the first showdown between Golding and Kiffin -- with the on-field meeting to come next fall, when Kiffin brings the Tigers to Oxford.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame entered 2026 still smarting from last season's College Football Playoff snub. The Fighting Irish were passed over for the final at-large spot in favor of Miami, which went on to finish as the national runner-up. But this new year offers a chance for redemption, and the 2026 schedule aligns perfectly with the opportunity. Only four true road games -- at BYU, North Carolina, Purdue and Syracuse  -- and neutral-site matchups at Navy and Wisconsin limit travel, while most opponents are projected to be manageable for Marcus Freeman and his team.With potential Heisman Trophy-contending quarterback CJ Carr returning, the Irish are the way-too-early favorites to win the national championship (+600) on FanDuel Sportsbook. Beginning this season, Notre Dame is also guaranteed an at-large bid in the field if it finishes anywhere inside the top 12 of the final CFP Rankings. While marquee matchups like Miami and SMU in November will provide real tests, the overall slate gives the Irish a clear structural advantage, setting up one of the cleanest paths to playoff contention the program has had in years.Notre Dame football 2026 scheduleSept. 6 Wisconsin (Green Bay)Sept. 12 RiceSept. 19 Michigan StateSept. 26 at PurdueOct. 3 at North CarolinaOct. 10 StanfordOct. 17 at BYUOct. 31 at Navy (Foxborough)Nov. 7 MiamiNov. 14 Boston CollegeNov. 21 SMUNov. 28 at SyracuseSo just how easy is the road in 2026? With limited travel, favorable matchups and only a few true tests on the slate, Notre Dame's schedule is built more for opportunity than survival. Here's a ranking of Notre Dame's 12 opponents, ordered from easiest to toughest heading into 2026.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    12. RiceThere are only two Group of Six teams on the 2026 schedule for Notre Dame. The home-opener against Rice in Week 2 is just the second meeting between the two in the 21st century. The Fighting Irish are 5-0 all-time against the Owls, who are expected to return just four starters from this past season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    11. at NavyThe rivalry with Navy has been one-sided in recent years, with Notre Dame winning each of the last eight matchups, including the most recent three by an average of 38.3 points. The Midshipmen will turn to a new starting quarterback in 2026 following Blake Horvath's departure. Maybe the unpredictable conditions in Foxborough on Halloween will give Navy a small edge and keep the game interesting. Still, the Fighting Irish should avoid any scares.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. at PurdueThe Boilermakers have struggled against top-tier competition, failing to beat an opponent that isn't FCS or Group of Six in 790 days. That drought will stretch past 1,000 days by the time Notre Dame heads to West Lafayette in late September. While Purdue has leaned on the transfer portal to add new talent, the gap between them and the Fighting Irish remains significant. Notre Dame enters with a 10‑game winning streak over Purdue.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. at SyracuseRemember the 70‑7 drubbing Notre Dame delivered to Syracuse this past season? That lopsided score was the Orange's worst loss in more than a century, dating back to the 1890s. Fran Brown will surely be looking for some measure of payback, but Notre Dame will enter the matchup with a massive psychological edge.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Boston CollegeBoston College enters a rebuild under third-year coach Bill O'Brien, with only five starters expected to return in 2026. Division II transfer quarterback Mason McKenzie could be dangerous if he adjusts to the FBS level, but heading into South Bend in mid-November -- when Notre Dame could be among the nation's top-ranked teams -- the Eagles will face an uphill battle to keep the game competitive.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. at North CarolinaYear 1 of the Bill Belichick experiment was a rough introduction for the Tar Heels. While the second season could bring improvement, there's little reason to expect North Carolina will pose a serious threat. Notre Dame has dominated historically, holding a 21‑2 all-time record against UNC.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. StanfordAlthough Stanford brought in Tavita Pritchard as its new coach, the offseason has been relatively quiet in terms of roster turnover, with only six incoming transfers. That's partly because the Cardinal expect to return 11 starters and more than half of the players who logged at least 100 snaps last season. Notre Dame has dominated the series since Marcus Freeman's loss to Stanford in 2022, winning the next three matchups by a combined 154‑50.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Michigan StateMichigan State isn't expected to be a Big Ten contender just yet, but the arrival of Pat Fitzgerald as coach should inject some energy and toughness into the program. The Spartans will be the second of three Big Ten opponents Notre Dame faces in the 2026 regular season, and the only one in South Bend. It's also a bit of a renewed rivalry, meeting for the first time since 2017.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. WisconsinFor the sixth straight season, Notre Dame will open on the road, this time heading north to Green Bay to take on Wisconsin. The game shouldn't be overly daunting, but it carries an intriguing subplot: Marcus Freeman played under Luke Fickell at Ohio State and later coached alongside him at Cincinnati. That shared history adds an extra layer to the matchup as the Fighting Irish look to start 2026 strong.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. SMUSMU will actually be the third team on Brandon Marcello's way‑too‑early top 25 for 2026 that Notre Dame is scheduled to face next season. This matchup marks the first meeting between the two programs since 1989, when the Fighting Irish rolled to a 59‑6 win.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. at BYUPlaying in Provo is always a tough test, and BYU enters 2026 with plenty of continuity, expected to return 14 starters from last season after it narrowly missed out on the CFP. The Cougars have proven dangerous against top competition, going 5‑1 vs. AP Top 25 teams over the past five seasons. Notre Dame has dominated the series in the 21st century, winning five of six matchups, with the lone loss coming on their most recent trip to Provo in 2004.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. MiamiNotre Dame undoubtedly circled this matchup after being left out of the CFP. While the Hurricanes will have to navigate some key departures, the assumption that they will land Duke quarterback transfer Darian Mensah suggests they could maintain much of the firepower that carried them to a national runner-up finish in 2025. Miami won the last two meetings on its home turf, but this will be the first trip to South Bend in a decade, where Notre Dame's last loss to the Hurricanes came in 1984.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- The Zuffa Boxing era kicks off on Friday night with Zuffa Boxing 01, a card headlined by a middleweight bout between Callum Walsh and Carlos Ocampo. The event is the first in TKO's foray into boxing and will stream live on Paramount+ from the Meta Apex in Las Vegas.Walsh (15-0, 11 KO) is undefeated as a professional and has steadily worked his way up in level of competition. In his most recent outing, Walsh picked up the biggest win of his career, scoring a decision win over undefeated Fernando Vargas on the undercard of Terence Crawford's vs. Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez this past September, which was co-promoted by Zuffa Boxing.Subscribe to Paramount+ now to get access to Zuffa Boxing 01 for just $8.99 per monthWalsh has long been close with UFC president and CEO Dana White, who has helped guide Walsh's career. This made Walsh a no-brainer as the first marquee signee for Zuffa Boxing.\n\"You know, I think it makes sense,\" Walsh told CBS Sports of being selected for such a prestigious spot. \"I've been around Dana, I've been around boxing for a while. I've been proving myself in the ring. I've been getting the wins. I've just had a big win in my last fight, and just the fact that I've been around Dana so long, you know, pushing him to get involved in boxing. I've proved that I will fight anybody and that I'm really bringing the same mindset as the UFC to boxing. So, I think it's only right to be the first main event and be given an opportunity to prove myself and to prove to everyone that's really what I'm about.\"White, when asked about the event and promoting Walsh, made sure to note that he's here for all the fighters, not just Walsh.\"Every time that I do something, I build a team around me that's extraordinary. This is what the matchmakers for boxing came up with,\" White told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"We believe that this is a strong card. Obviously, Callum is a kid that I've supported for a long time. People thought that I was his manager ... I've never made a dollar off Callum. I've just liked him from the time I met him and I've backed him, and here we are today. Just because I've had a relationship with this kid and he's in this position ... I don't determine who wins the fights.\"  \nIn Ocampo (38-3, 26 KO), Walsh faces a fighter with several high-level fights, though he has come up short in all of his biggest outings.Ocampo fought for the IBF welterweight title in 2018, losing by first-round stoppage. He then fought twice for interim junior middleweight titles, losing a decision to Sebastian Fundora and by first-round knockout to Tim Tszyu in 2022 and 2023, respectively.Aside from those moments where Ocampo faced fighters who rate among the best of the best in the game, he has been perfect and is frequently runs through his opposition. Since the loss to Tszyu, Ocampo has rattled off three consecutive stoppage victories, though against opposition well below Walsh's level.\nStill, Walsh believes Ocampo's experience makes him a dangerous opponent.\"I'm expecting an all-action fight, you know,\" Walsh said. \"I'm expecting a real fight. You know, this is a real opponent. This is a real test for me to prove myself. He's been in there with big names. He has a lot of experience, and if I can beat him, if I can get him out of there, then I'll prove that I am up there with the best of him.\"Friday's main card also features a middleweight bout between undefeated fighters Misael Rodriguez and Austin Deanda and opens with a junior welterweight bout between Cain Sandoval and Julian Rodriguez.Sandoval vs. Rodriguez stands out as an excellent kickoff to the first Zuffa Boxing main card. The undefeated Sandoval is getting a big opportunity, but has shown big knockout power throughout his career. Rodriguez is coming off a 10th-round knockout of Avious Griffin, the highly-touted Most Valuable Promotions prospect, on the undercard of Jake Paul's bout with Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.\nElsewhere on the card, Omar Trinidad takes on Max Ornelas at featherweight, Floyd Diaz returns to face off against Guillermo Gutierrez at bantamweight and Emiliano Cardenas takes on Marcus Harris also at bantamweight.Let's take a closer look at the rest of the card set for Friday with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Zuffa Boxing 01 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookCallum Walsh -700 vs. Carlos Ocampo +450, middleweightsMisael Rodriguez -700 vs. Austin Deanda +450, middleweightsCain Sandoval -230 vs. Julian Rodriguez +180, junior welterweightsOmar Trinidad -265 vs. Max Ornelas +205, featherweightsFloyd Diaz -1100 vs. Guillermo Gutierrez +600, bantamweightsEmiliano Cardenas -1100 vs. Marcus Harris +600, bantamweightsRobert Meriwether III -3000 vs. Cesar Correa +1000, junior lightweightsTroy Nash -1600 vs. Jaycob Ramos +750, featherweightsPredictionsOcampo is a fine fighter, but he's someone who has built a career where he is seen as an opponent more than a contender. That said, Ocampo brings the fight to his opponents, and Walsh has an opportunity to deliver a result that will be directly compared to Ocampo's results against Spence, Fundora and Tszyu.\nOcampo leaves himself open to be hit, and Walsh has good pop. There is one interesting angle here, which is Walsh moving up from fighting at junior middleweight (154 pounds) to middleweight (160) for this fight. Sometimes, fighters see a dropoff in their punching power as they move up in weight; other times, they have more power because they aren't affected by cutting extra weight.Expect Walsh to find the stoppage in this one, but how quickly he gets there and how he looks doing it will be intriguing things to follow. Pick: Callum Walsh via TKO3\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Seattle Seahawks are a perfect 3-0 in NFC Championship Games, but the Los Angeles Rams have won each of their last four conference title game appearances. Something's got to give when these NFC West rivals meet with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line on Sunday in Seattle. The top-seeded Seahawks (14-3) look to earn their first Super Bowl berth since the 2014 season when they host the No. 5 seed Rams (12-5) in the 2025 NFC Championship Game at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Lumen Field.The Seahawks lost their lone AFC Championship Game appearance back when the team was part of the AFC West in 1983, but they're perfect in conference title games since joining the NFC, winning the game in 2005, 2013 and 2014. The Rams are no stranger to the NFC Championship Game, but after losing six of their first seven appearances, they've won four straight, most recently in 2021 before the franchise won its second Super Bowl trophy.These teams split their regular-season series, with both games being very close and the home team winning both times. L.A. won the first matchup 21-19 thanks to four interceptions by the defense despite Matthew Stafford throwing for only 130 yards. Seattle won at home in a wild Thursday affair in Week 16, rallying from a 16-point deficit to defeat the Rams 38-37 in overtime.Los Angeles prevailed in both of the previous playoff matchups between the division rivals, winning 27-20 in 2004 and 30-20 in 2020. The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 46.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for the Los Angeles vs. Seattle NFC Championship Game showdown.Rams vs. Seahawks odds\nOpening spread: Seahawks -2.5Opening money line: Seahawks -155, Rams +130Opening total: 47.5The point spread for this matchup hasn't budged at DraftKings. There's only a one-point difference from when these teams met in Seattle on Dec. 18, when the Rams covered as 1.5-point underdogs. The total has dipped slightly, though, to 46.5.Rams betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 14-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 12-7 (including playoffs)O/U record: 11-8 (Including playoffs)The Rams covered the spread in five of their final seven regular-season games but have yet to do so in the playoffs. They were favored by 10 points on the road against the Carolina Panthers in the Wild Card Round but only managed to escape with a 34-31 victory. As 3.5-point road favorites in the Divisional Round, Los Angeles advanced with a 20-17 overtime triumph in Chicago.All five of the Rams' regular-season losses were by one score, but only the setback in Seattle was by fewer than three points. Stafford was superb in that Thursday night contest, throwing for 457 yards and three touchdowns -- including a pair to Puka Nacua, who finished with 12 receptions for 225 yards. Stafford put up those numbers without the presence of Davante Adams, who missed the game with a hamstring injury.Stafford had 304 passing yards and three scoring tosses in the Rams' playoff opener against Carolina but failed to throw for a TD versus Chicago, marking the first time he has gone without a touchdown pass since the team's 13-9 victory against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17 last season. Nacua made 10 catches for 111 yards and a TD while also running for a score versus the Panthers but was kept out of the end zone by the Bears as he hauled in five passes for 56 yards. Seahawks betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 15-3 (including playoffs)ATS record: 13-5 (including playoffs)O/U record: 10-8 (including playoffs)The Seahawks covered the spread in their final two regular-season contests after failing to do so in their previous two and did so with ease against the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round. Seattle followed a 10-point victory as a 2.5-point favorite at San Francisco in Week 18 with a 41-6 rout of its NFC West rival at home last week while favored by seven points.Seattle covered as a three-point underdog in its first meeting with Los Angeles in 2025 but defeated the Rams by just one point as a 1.5-point favorite in the second encounter. Sam Darnold had a performance he'd like to forget in the Week 11 clash as he had 279 passing yards but threw four interceptions without a touchdown in a two-point loss. The 28-year-old was picked off by Los Angeles two more times in Week 16 but had a pair of TD tosses and threw a game-winning 2-point try in overtime.Darnold entered the Divisional Round against the 49ers nursing an oblique injury but wasn't required to do much as he completed 12-of-17 pass attempts for 124 yards and a touchdown. Kenneth Walker III provided most of the offense for the Seahawks, rushing 19 times for 116 yards and matching Shaun Alexander's franchise playoff record with three TD runs.Walker ran for a score in both regular-season meetings with the Rams and gained 100 yards on the ground in the Week 16 victory. The 25-year-old will be asked to come up with another big effort Sunday as Darnold still is showing up on the injury report and running mate Zach Charbonnet, who led Seattle with a career-high 12 rushing touchdowns, suffered a season-ending torn ACL versus San Francisco last week.Rams-Seahawks prop pick: Kenneth Walker III Over 19.5 carries\nWith Charbonnet out and Darnold unlikely to do any running because of his oblique issue, Walker likely is in for a busy day. Velus Jones Jr. rushed six times in mop-up duty last week but was ineffective, gaining only 10 yards. Jones, who had only four carries -- all in one game -- during the regular season, was placed back on the practice squad. George Holani (hamstring), is set to serve as Walker's backup here as the second-year back was activated from injured reserve on Friday. Holani had 73 yards on 22 carries this season. The Seahawks also have former Rams running back Cam Akers as an option, though he hasn't registered a carry this season despite appearing in three games. That leaves me thinking Walker will have a heavy workload. He matched his season high with 19 carries in the Divisional Round victory and has had 20 or more attempts just three times over the last three campaigns after having at least 21 on six occasions as a rookie in 2022. But he had 25 carries against the Rams last year and set a career high with 29 versus Los Angeles in his debut season. What's more, Walker was rested last week after his third TD run early in the fourth quarter. With head coach Mike Macdonald having very few options, I expect the two-time 1,000-yard rusher to carry the ball at least 20 times with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are down to the final four teams, with the 2026 Championship Round NFL schedule taking place on Sunday. Both No. 1 seeds will host, though one is a favorite and one is an underdog, per the Championship Round NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. Seattle is giving 2.5 points to the Rams in the NFC title game at 6:30 p.m. ET, and the Seahawks have made the Super Bowl in each of its three previous times being a top seed. However, the first Super Bowl participant will come from the AFC Title Game at 3 p.m. ET, and the top-seeded Broncos are 4.5-point home underdogs to utilize in Championship Round NFL picks. That makes Denver the biggest conference championship home underdog of all-time.Of course, Bo Nix (ankle) being done for the year has much to do with that NFL spread as Denver's new starting quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, hasn't thrown a pass in two years. Thus, there is a lot to consider before making any NFL playoffs bets for the title games. All of the updated Championship Round   NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Championship Round   NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Championship Round NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Championship Round   NFL predictionsOne of the model's strongest Championship Round   NFL picks is the Under (42.5) hits in Patriots vs. Broncos at 3 p.m. ET. Denver has been an underdog five times this season, and the Under has hit in four of those games. Meanwhile, the Pats have failed to reach the total in four of their last six games as an away favorite. With Nix out, the Broncos' offense will take a step back, but Sean Payton will also adjust his game plan and run the ball more to eat up the clock. For the Pats, Maye has looked shaky during the postseason with six total fumbles (three lost), two interceptions and getting sacked 10 times across two games. Thus, many New England drives end up in kicks, or turnovers, which prevents the scoring running up. The model has the teams combining for 40 points as the Under hits in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Under (-105) using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Championship Round   NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in both games of the Championship Round   NFL schedule, and it has two A-rated picks, including one versus the spread. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what NFL Championship Round picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you lock in now?

Though no games have been canceled as of yet, many are being rescheduled in the hopes that they can be played before the worst of the weather arrives. Icy and snowy conditions are expected to make travel difficult or impossible in some places, which obviously changes how teams approach their respective journeys. A total of 22 teams ranked inside the latest AP Top 25 poll are in action Saturday, when the worst of the winter storm is expected to hit a majority of states. While some Midwestern and Northern schools are undoubtedly used to adverse winter conditions, universities in the South and Southeast United States often don't have comparable infrastructure.

Thursday was just the latest step in his star turn.In a 107-97 win over the Washington Wizards, Watson finished with 35 points, eight rebounds, four blocks, three assists and two steals. You can take that with a grain of salt, sure. It was the Wizards, after all. But since Jokić went down, Watson is averaging over 23 points per game. After years of struggling to develop a 3-point shot, he's up to 42.1% from deep this season on by far the highest volume of his career. Years of playing off of Jokić have honed his off-ball instincts, but in an NBA increasingly reliant on having multiple ball-handlers, the fact that more than one-third of his field goals have been unassisted since Jokić went down looms large. He's exactly the sort of big, athletic, multi-positional defender teams crave. He is, in short, becoming a perfect modern basketball player.This bodes incredibly well for the 2025-26 Denver Nuggets as they attempt to win their second championship in franchise history. Depth limitations cost them their last two shots at the title. They've effectively lacked exactly this sort of player. If Denver wins it all this season, Watson's ascendance is probably going to be a big reason why.But it creates some potentially significant financial problems for the 2026-27 Nuggets. Watson hasn't just grown into exactly the sort of player Denver needs. He's grown into exactly the sort of player everyone needs. The timing works out nicely for Watson. He's an impending restricted free agent, and demand is going to be high. There are quite a few teams at the bottom of the standings with cap space that are seemingly planning to be competitive next season. The Jazz, Nets, Wizards and Bulls could all use someone like Watson. The Lakers loom here as well, though it's unclear how they'll manage their potential cap space.\nDenver not only has full Bird Rights on Watson, but the right to match any offer he gets in restricted free agency. Here's where things get tricky: as of right now, with just 11 players under contract for next season along with their first-round pick, the Nuggets are already projected to exceed the second apron. That's without Watson. With him? You can bet interested parties will try to frontload offer sheets to make Denver sweat. That could mean a payroll $25-30 million above the second apron. For reference, the most expensive team this season is Cleveland. The Cavaliers are around $22 million above the second apron, and will therefore pay roughly $392 million for their roster with luxury tax included. Denver would have to pay far more than that, because the Cavaliers aren't paying the repeater tax penalty. The Nuggets would. Depending on how expensive Watson gets, they'd potentially have the highest payroll in NBA history.Let's make this clear from the jump: the Nuggets should just pay it. There's a time for frugality. That time is not when you have the greatest player in franchise history at the absolute peak of his powers. It might be 50 years before Denver has a player as good as Jokić or a team as good as this one. The Kroenke family, owners of this team, the Colorado Avalanche and the Los Angeles Rams, can afford a brief payroll bump. But they're not exactly Steve Ballmer or Joe Lacob. While they've paid the tax to keep the Nuggets in contention, they're not unlimited spenders. They let Kentavious Caldwell-Pope walk for free in 2024 to duck the second apron. Part of the motivation for last summer's Michael Porter Jr. trade was saving money. Sure enough, Denver has a pretty clear path to ducking the luxury tax this year if it wants to, though that would not reset their repeater tax clock. Their history would suggest some degree of caution when it comes to payroll. They're not the Warriors. The budget might be high, but it exists.That's probably going to mean finding savings somehow, and it's probably going to be a more significant move than. So let's go through the options the Nuggets are likely weighing here as they figure out Watson's future.\nOption No. 1: Trade Watson nowLet's make this clear from the jump: Denver shouldn't do this. Even if the Nuggets know for certain that they're losing Watson over the summer, his presence is meaningful enough to their 2026 championship odds that keeping him now is still the correct choice. The Nuggets really shouldn't be thinking long-term here. That isn't just because Jokić is in his prime, but because the Thunder and Spurs aren't. In all likelihood, no matter what course the Nuggets take with Watson, their 2026 team will be better than their 2027 team and their 2027 team will be better than their 2028 team. Their core is getting older. Oklahoma City and San Antonio are still so young that the natural course of time will help them as much as it hurts Denver. The Nuggets have several years of contention ahead of them, but their best chance at another title is here and now. Their odds probably decrease with each passing season.This is only worth bringing up because of the haul Watson could generate. Every team needs wings. Every team needs youth. Every team can afford to trade for Watson's $4.4 million cap hit. There would probably be multi-first-round pick offers out there for Watson right now. Even with his raise coming next season, his restricted free agent rights would be that valuable. They could also combine him with other matching salary to pursue win-now help that makes more financial sense moving forward.Of course, if you asked what the Nuggets would need in a world without Watson on their roster, the answer would be \"someone like Peyton Watson.\" So that more or less eliminates this concept. There's no price that would make it worthwhile for this year's team.\nOption No. 2: Sign-and-trade him over the summerThis option is slightly more desirable than trading Watson now for the simple reason that it allows him to be a part of this year's championship push. However, an offseason sign-and-trade would come with significantly more complications than an in-season deal involving his meager rookie contract. Why? Because under the 2023 CBA, when a player is signed-and-traded, the trading team can only bring salary back in the deal if it agrees to remain below the second apron for the rest of the league year. That wouldn't be plausible for the reasons we've already covered. Denver is slated to be a second-apron team next season. Therefore, the Nuggets would have to sign-and-trade Watson to a team with the cap space to absorb him so as to avoid that second-apron hard cap. In other words, the field is smaller. It would just be the teams with the money to pursue him as a free agent anyway.However, those teams would still be incentivized to cooperate with Denver because of those match rights. Signing Watson to an offer sheet means tying up your cap space for 48 hours as you wait for the other team to potentially match the deal. Considering how quickly free agency moves now, by the time Denver potentially matched, there would be no other good way for the team in question to spend its money if not on Watson. Agreeing to a sign-and-trade guarantees that you'll actually secure Watson, provided he is on board with the contract. It would require cooperation from all three parties, but it's potentially doable. If the Nuggets decide Watson is the odd man out of their payroll, this is probably the course they take. If they decide Watson is essential for the long haul, well, we move on to other options.Option No. 3: Nickel and dime the depth over the summerWe can broadly say that Denver's core consists of Jokić, Murray, Aaron Gordon, Christian Braun, Cam Johnson and now, Watson. Say the Nuggets could find someone to take the $7.5 million or so owed to Zeke Nnaji. That would likely mean attaching their first-round pick, which means shedding another $3 million or so in salary. And then there's Jonas Valančiūnas. His $10 million salary for next season is non-guaranteed, and given his offseason desire to return to Europe, he might not mind getting waived anyway. Between just those maneuvers, Denver could clear out a decent chunk of change.\nThen you'd look to the structure of the Watson contract. The longer it goes, the lower you could theoretically set his starting salary. Consider the contract the Nuggets just gave Braun last offseason. He's getting paid $125 million over five years, or an average of $25 million. His salary in the first year of the deal, however, is at $21.5 million. He just gets 8% annual raises. Denver could structure a Watson deal this way if it needed to save every last penny for the 2026-27 deal.Say Watson's deal starts where Braun's did. That six-man core would cost Denver roughly $207.3 million. The projected second apron is around $223.1 million. Denver couldn't duck it entirely, but with rookie deals and minimum salaries everywhere else, it could at least stay reasonably close to the line rather than bolting miles beyond it as Cleveland has this season.Of course, that would mean betting big on minimum-salary players and cheap youngsters as depth. Valančiūnas has been the best backup center of the Jokić era. Would DaRon Holmes really be ready to replace him? Could Jalen Pickett and Hunter Tyson play consistent rotation roles as Booth once intended? Would they dump Julian Strawther and his $4.8 million considering how poorly he's played this year?\nDenver would immediately become the most desirable minimum-salary destination in the NBA. Second-apron teams usually are because high-level minimum players know they can get minutes on those teams. It's how Milwaukee has done so well on the minimum market lately. Denver was already succeeding on that front having gotten Tim Hardaway Jr. and Bruce Brown for the minimum this season. But go ask the 2024 Suns or the 2022 Lakers what happens when you bet too big on minimums. There's a reason those players are available for that price. You might hit on one or two. It's very, very difficult to build an entire bench that way.Option No. 4: Trade someone expensive over the summerWe've covered the \"cheap out on the bench\" path. Now, we consider that five-man core. Jokić is obviously untouchable. Murray almost certainly is too, not only now that he's headed for his first All-Star selection, but because, given the market we've seen for players like Ja Morant and Trae Young, there just isn't a worthwhile trade market out there for small guards on max contracts anyway. So really, the question becomes, would Denver potentially value Watson more than Gordon, Braun or Johnson? There are interesting conversations to be had about any of them.Gordon is the player of those three that Watson theoretically overlaps with the most. Part of the reason Watson struggled to get consistent minutes early in his career was that he was, to an extent, a worse version of Gordon. They were both athletic freaks valuable primarily for defense and cutting, but since they both struggled to make 3s, playing them together would cramp the offense's spacing too much. Well, now both of them can shoot, so that limitation is gone. They've played 289 minutes together this season with a +13.5 net rating. The only real motivation for trading Gordon would be trying to get ahead of any age- or injury-related decline. He's 30, so that may be coming, but he's still so good and has so much equity with that organization that a trade feels almost impossible. Denver likely wants to lean further into the Gordon-Watson pairing for its defensive upside, not split it apart.\nThat leaves Braun and Johnson. Braun is homegrown. He was drafted by the old front office, but extended by the current one. Johnson is the external addition. The Nuggets gave up a valuable first-round pick to get him, so there is plenty of investment there, but he's had an up-and-down first season in Denver. He's making his 3s now, but he hasn't brought quite as much as a creator or defender as the Nuggets likely hoped. Braun is the more well-rounded player, but Johnson has the skill set they need more given his shot. Braun's hesitance to take any 3-pointer that isn't wide-open is a meaningful offensive detriment even if he makes the ones he takes. The Nuggets will always be a low-volume shooting team, so they've needed someone like Johnson or Michael Porter Jr. to help balance their shot diet.It's always easier to predict a trade for the recent addition than the team lifer. Johnson is older and the team is probably less attached to him. But depending on how the rest of the season goes for Watson, either would be plausible candidates for a trade in order to facilitate keeping him. Watson has been better than Johnson this season. He's been better this year than ever version of Braun has ever been. Watson may not be at the Jokić-Murray-Gordon level of importance in Denver, but there's a real chance he passes the other two before the dust settles in June. At that point, it might just come down to who Denver can get a better offer for.Option No. 5: Wait until 2027, let existing contracts expireEverything we've covered thus far would involve changes for the 2026-27 season. But, as we argued from the beginning, the Nuggets should just pay the giant tax bill. After all, the way they're set up, it could theoretically just be a one-year blip. Even if Valančiūnas comes back, his contract expires in the summer of 2027. So does Johnson's. Maybe the move here is to get really expensive for one year, try to make the most of the next 18 months in pursuit of another ring or two, and then let some money come off of the books and re-evaluate where you stand.\nThere's one other notable Nugget whose salary will be different for the 2027-28 season, and that's Jokić. He was eligible for an extension last offseason and declined it. The expectation is that he will re-sign this summer, and that deal will include declining his 2027-28 player option and adding multiple years in its place. He's worth every cent he's eligible to sign for, but maybe the Nuggets could convince him to shave just a little bit off of his max to help keep more of the team together. Likely? Probably not. The best player in the world shouldn't offer discounts. But he's already cycled through multiple max deals, and the cap is rising so quickly that contract figures have gotten big enough for some players to willingly accept a bit less. Jalen Brunson and Kevin Durant have done so recently, albeit under somewhat different circumstances.In a perfect world for Nuggets fans, ownership would keep this team together for as long as it is capable of contending for championships. That just isn't realistic. The Kroenkes should pay whatever it takes to do that. Their history running the Nuggets suggests they'll likely be a bit thriftier. If this team can't sustain a historic payroll indefinitely, fine. Denver is a small market. It doesn't generate the revenue teams like the Warriors and Clippers did when they were racking up monster tax bills on an annual basis. Having some line is reasonable. But punting on a team this good because of one expensive season would be an enormous disappointment. This is the appropriate middle ground. Play out the next two years. See how it goes. Adjust accordingly. And don't let this breakout player walk for nothing.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a pretty straightforward schedule next week with most teams playing four games. However, there is one team that will take the floor five times. With the schedule in mind, let's hit the waiver wire and discuss five players to consider adding who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues.Jalen Smith, Chicago Bulls (49% rostered)The Bulls are the one team that plays five times next week. They will be making up a game against the Heat that was previously postponed because of condensation on their home court. The oddity is that the Bulls will play the Heat three straight games next week over a four-day span. Two of the three games will be in Miami.Smith has already been a valuable contributor lately, averaging 11.5 points, 9.0 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 1.8 three-pointers over his last 13 games. He logged 25 minutes a night during that span, with his playing time aided by the absence of Zach Collins (toe). Even if the Bulls didn't play the most games next week, Smith would be worth adding. The additional games are an added bonus.Kyle Filipowski, Utah Jazz (40% rostered)The Jazz have already started to rest players. Lauri Markkanen has missed six straight games with an illness. Jusuf Nurkic has missed seven of their last 13 games. In a couple of those games, the Jazz didn't even announce beforehand that Nurkic was going to sit out for rest. He just never checked into the game. As they try to rack up losses and improve their lottery odds, plenty more rest days could be coming for their top players.\nWith the Jazz shorthanded up front, Filipowski has averaged 26 minutes over the last six games. During that stretch, he provided 11.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, 2.5 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.0 three-pointers a game. He also shot 50.0% from the field and 81.8% from the charity stripe. The Jazz play four games next week, which includes a back-to-back set that figures to see players rested. Filipowski shouldn't be available in more than half of leagues at this point.Sandro Mamukelashvili, Toronto Raptors (30% rostered)Jakob Poeltl (back) has been out for over a month for the Raptors. It wasn't encouraging to hear earlier this week that he was headed back to Toronto to visit with a specialist. To complicate matters for the Raptors, Collin Murray-Boyles (thumb) has missed back-to-back games.Over his last 15 games without Poeltl, Mamukelashvili has averaged 12.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.4 three-pointers. He continues to be an efficient scorer, shooting a career-high 52.7% from the field for the season. Although the Raptors only play three games next week, the potential for Poeltl to remain sidelined long term makes rostering Mamukelashvili appealing.\nJock Landale, Memphis Grizzlies (27% rostered)Landale had never averaged more than 14 minutes a game for a season in his career before becoming a member of the Grizzlies. This season, he has provided 11.3 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.1 three-pointers over 23 minutes a night. He has even averaged 25 minutes over his last 14 games, generating 12.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.3 three-pointers during that span.Unless the Grizzlies make a trade, they won't have reinforcements coming for the frontcourt anytime soon. Zach Edey (ankle) is likely out into March, and Brandon Clarke (calf) is on a similar timeline. Not only is Landale worth adding for the Grizzlies' upcoming four-game week, but he has long-term fantasy value.Sam Hauser, Boston Celtics (24% rostered)Hauser started the first two games of the season for the Celtics before being moved to the bench. He played limited minutes in that role, but the Celtics recently inserted him back into the starting five. Over nine games since the change was made, Hauser has averaged 28 minutes. That's five more minutes per game than his overall average for the season.\nWith Hauser playing more, he averaged 14.4 points, 4.3 rebounds and 4.0 three-pointers during that nine-game span. He shot 50.6% from the field and 46.2% from three. He has never finished a season shooting worse than 40% from behind the arc and is on pace to average at least 2.3 three-pointers for the third straight campaign. The Celtics have four games on the docket for next week, making Hauser a top target for fantasy managers in need of three-pointers. All four of his games will also be played in Boston, where he has shot 42.7% from deep this season. All four of his opponents (Trail Blazers, Hawks, Kings and Bucks) also rank inside the bottom-half of the league in defensive rating.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fresh off the first losing season of the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes era, the Kansas City Chiefs are turning to a familiar face to help the team rebound in 2026. The Chiefs announced Friday that they have agreed to terms with Eric Bieniemy to return as the team's offensive coordinator.Bieniemy, who spent the 2025 season as the running backs coach of the Chicago Bears, is replacing Matt Nagy, whose contract is set to expire and has been interviewing for other jobs around the league. Bieniemy, 56, helped the Chiefs win two Super Bowls during his five-year run as the team's offensive coordinator from 2018-22. During that time, the Chiefs boasted one of the NFL's most potent offenses, led by Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. Kansas City continued to have success on offense even after former All-Pro receiver Tyreek Hill was traded to the Miami Dolphins after the 2021 season. Despite the Chiefs' success over that span, Bieniemy did not receive any serious consideration for available head-coaching positions at that time. Because of that, he accepted a lateral move to the Washington Commanders in 2023, allowing him to call plays. He lasted just one year in Washington as the team struggled through a 4-13 season. \nBieniemy then had a brief tenure as UCLA's associate head coach and offensive coordinator before landing in Chicago as part of Ben Johnson's initial staff. This season, the Bears finished third in the NFL in both rushing yards and third in average yards per carry as running backs D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai respectively ran for 1,087 and 783 yards and a combined 14 touchdowns. A former NFL running back, Bieniemy spent five years as a running backs coach in the college ranks before serving the same role with the Minnesota Vikings in 2006. During that time, he worked closely with Adrian Peterson, who was named to four straight Pro Bowls during his time with Bieniemy. Bieniemy served as the Chiefs' running backs coach for five years before being promoted to offensive coordinator in 2018, Mahomes' first season as the team's starting quarterback. That season, the Chiefs led the NFL in scoring while Mahomes threw a league-high 50 touchdowns. The Chiefs won their first of three Super Bowls over a five-year span the following season. \nThere are several questions surrounding the Chiefs entering the offseason with Mahomes coming off a torn ACL and Kelce mulling retirement. At least one question has now been answered with Bieniemy back in place orchestrating the offense alongside Reid. \n            ",

Johnson, 55, died from \"blunt head trauma and stab wounds,\" the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner said. His death has been ruled a homicide.Authorities are investigating and believe Johnson was living at the homeless encampment at the time of his death. According to the AP, Johnson's friends believe health issues in his post-playing career contributed to his unstable living situation.The New England Patriots selected Johnson out of Texas Southern in the fourth round of the 1993 NFL Draft. The Patriots released him before the season, but he caught on for a brief stint on the Minnesota Vikings' practice squad.\nJohnson's NFL career found some traction in August 1995 when the Eagles claimed him off of waivers. That season, Johnson appeared in 11 games, starting one, while accumulating 19 tackles, six sacks and a defensive touchdown. Johnson also saw action in two playoff games that season, notching two tackles.In 1996, Johnson appeared in 12 games for Philadelphia and started in five. He totaled 24 tackles and a sack that fall, but the Eagles released him in December. Johnson signed with the Raiders ahead of the 1997 season, and he played in 15 games while recording 11 total tackles.\nAfter his NFL career came to an end, Johnson went to the Arena Football League, where he won an Arena Bowl championship with the Orlando Predators in 1998 and lost in the Arena Bowl in 1999. Johnson also played for the Los Angeles Avengers from 2000-01.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Florida coach Todd Golden made his stance clear Thursday regarding the ongoing Charles Bediako eligibility saga -- but he's equally unshaken about the Gators' chances when they face Alabama on Feb. 1 in Gainesville.Bediako, who declared for the 2023 NBA Draft after two seasons with the Crimson Tide, went undrafted and later signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. Earlier this week, he filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after it denied his appeal to return to college basketball. On Wednesday, Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts -- an Alabama donor -- granted a temporary restraining order allowing Bediako to suit up immediately for the Crimson Tide. The order is valid for 10 days, expiring just before Florida and Alabama meet. A hearing on a preliminary injunction is scheduled for next Tuesday.\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Charles Bediako's case could crater college hoops; inside Virginia's rapid rise\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSpeaking on a university sponsored radio show Gator Talk on Thursday, Golden expressed frustration with the situation. \"The reality is, I don't agree with it, and I don't think he should be playing,\" Golden said. \"I also don't fault (Alabama coach) Nate Oats because this is a very competitive space, and it's our jobs to win games and do everything you can to be the best program in our specific league.\"\nGolden also said Bediako's potential presence won't distract Florida.\"We are going to beat them anyway,\" Golden said. \"If he plays, we'll beat them anyways.\"The 16th-ranked Gators (14-5), who are the reigning national champions, have won five consecutive games and sit tied atop the SEC standings ahead of Saturday's matchup against Auburn. Meanwhile, No. 17 Alabama (13-5) has struggled particularly with interior defense and rebounding -- areas Bediako could immediately impact if he suits up.Golden also addressed the broader implications for college basketball if situations like this become more common. He expressed concern about rules being bypassed through legal maneuvers and the potential \"slippery slope\" it could create for future players.\n\"I think there are a lot of people that aren't necessarily happy about it and don't necessarily agree with it,\" Golden said. \"This guy had a great opportunity. He was at Alabama for two years. He played there and was there during the NIL era. He was aware of what he was giving up by declaring to go to the draft. He stayed in past the date. It's always been that if you stay in and you sign a contract, you are done, so I think this is a slippery slope.\"Golden added that schools and conferences often have limited options in these cases, but he believes more needs to be done to uphold the integrity of college athletics. \"With all this intervention from judges, there's only so much the league can do, there's only so much other member schools in the league can do,\"Golden said. \"We just need some people to stand up and start taking a stand.\"\n            ",

The headliner is the Rams at Seattle, but hopefully we'll get a great game with New England at Denver.  The AFC Championship Game has lost some luster with Bo Nix (ankle) out, and we'll see how the Broncos offense looks with Jarrett Stidham under center. I don't have a lot of confidence in Denver's players for any Fantasy leagues this weekend.  Here, we have all your Fantasy needs covered with starts, sits, and sleepers for each game for the Championship Round. We also have DFS lineups you can use on DraftKings and FanDuel.  In DFS, I'd take some fliers on Broncos like Marvin Mims Jr. and Lil'Jordan Humphrey, which you'll see below. But you have to keep an eye on the injury report to see if Troy Franklin (hamstring) and Pat Bryant (concussion) will play against the Patriots.  Franklin and Bryant were injured in the Divisional Round against Buffalo, which allowed Mims and Humphrey to play well. Mims had eight catches for 93 yards and a touchdown on eight targets against the Bills, and Humphrey had two catches for 33 yards and a touchdown on five targets. He also dropped another touchdown against Buffalo.  Courtland Sutton will be tough to trust since he's scored 9.3 PPR points or less in three games in a row, and that was with Nix. Sutton will likely see a lot of New England's top cornerback, Christian Gonzalez, and Sutton should struggle in that matchup.  As for Denver's backfield, we could see J.K. Dobbins (foot) play for the first time since he went on injured reserve after getting hurt in Week 10. That would make things messy for RJ Harvey, and I'll tell you below why Harvey is someone to avoid against the Patriots. Start 'Em & Sit' EmPatriots at BroncosStart: Rhamondre Stevenson  Stevenson had 16 carries for 70 yards and four catches for 11 yards on four targets against Houston in the Divisional Round. He has now scored at least 12.1 PPR points in five games in a row, and I expect Stevenson to have another solid outing against Denver this week. The Broncos have allowed three running backs in their past five games to score at least 14.1 PPR points, and James Cook and Ray Davis combined for 24 carries for 117 yards and four catches for 57 yards on five targets last week. Stevenson will continue to share work with TreVeyon Henderson in this game, but Stevenson is clearly the running back to trust for New England right now.  Sit: RJ Harvey  I'm going to stay away from Harvey altogether if J.K. Dobbins (foot) plays for the first time since Week 10, but I would avoid Harvey also if he's a solo act. The Patriots are tough to run on with defensive lineman Milton Williams on the field. In the past three games against Miami, the Chargers, and Houston since Williams returned from a five-game absence with an ankle injury, those backfields have combined for 52 carries for 93 yards and eight catches for 51 yards on 12 targets. And in the first 11 games of the season, when Williams was healthy, the Patriots allowed just two rushing touchdowns to running backs. This could be a bad week for Harvey, who was held to six carries for 20 yards and five catches for 46 yards on six targets against Buffalo.  Sleeper: Hunter Henry  Henry had a quiet game against Houston last week with one catch for 5 yards on two targets, but he had scored at least 10.6 PPR points in each of his previous four outings prior to the Divisional Round, including three touchdowns. Denver has struggled with tight ends of late, with five guys scoring at least 14.6 PPR points against the Broncos in their past eight games, including Dalton Kincaid last week with six catches for 83 yards and a touchdown on six targets. I'm expecting Drake Maye to lean on Henry quite a bit in this matchup.Rams at SeahawksStart: Kenneth Walker III  Zach Charbonnet (ACL) is out, and Seattle will lean on Walker against the Rams. Charbonnet was injured in the Divisional Round against the 49ers, and Walker had 19 carries for 116 yards, three touchdowns, and three catches for 29 yards on three targets. Charbonnet also missed one game during the season in Week 3 against New Orleans with a foot injury, and Walker had 16 carries for 38 yards and two touchdowns and one catch for 12 yards on one target. Walker also did well against the Rams in two games this season in tandem with Charbonnet. In Week 11 at Los Angeles, Walker had 16 carries for 67 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 44 yards on three targets for 20.1 PPR points. And in Week 16 against the Rams, Walker had 11 carries for 100 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 64 yards on three targets for 25.4 PPR points. The Rams just allowed the combination of D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai to get 32 carries for 112 yards and four catches for 36 yards on four targets. And in the Wild-Card Round, Chuba Hubbard scored 19.9 PPR points against the Rams.  Sit: Davante Adams  Adams has struggled in the two playoff games since he returned from a three-game absence with a hamstring injury, and he could be tough to trust in this matchup against Seattle. Against Carolina and Chicago, Adams combined for seven catches for 96 yards and no touchdowns on 19 targets. He missed the last game against the Seahawks with the hamstring injury in Week 16, and he only had one catch for a 1-yard touchdown against Seattle in Week 11 despite eight targets. The Seahawks secondary is tough against outside receivers, and no receiver has scored a touchdown against Seattle in the past three games. That said, I would still trust Puka Nacua in this matchup, and he had 19 catches for 300 yards and two touchdowns on 24 targets in two games against Seattle this year.  Sleeper: Colby Parkinson and Terrance Ferguson  I wouldn't be surprised if Parkinson and Ferguson played well in this game, and both were heavily involved in the Divisional Round against Chicago. Parkinson had seven targets for three catches and 56 yards, and Ferguson had five targets for one catch and 19 yards. Parkinson now has seven targets in three of his past four games, with three touchdowns over that span, and he scored against Seattle in Week 11 with two catches for 14 yards on two targets. Ferguson had three catches for 33 yards and a touchdown on four targets in Week 16 against the Seahawks, and he has two touchdowns in his past three games overall.

    "body": "\n        The women's college basketball season has been absolutely wild, and now that we're a few weeks into conference play, CBS Sports thought it was a good time to take stock of the season so far and hand out some midseason awards. For these awards, we picked the player we believed deserved the award right this moment -- so through the games on Thursday, Jan. 22. We also revisited our preseason predictions and updated our picks for regular-season conference winners, Final Four and national champs. Without further ado, here are our midseason award winners and end-of-season predictions:Midseason awardsAward\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Jack Maloney\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isabel Gonzalez\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Lindsay Gibbs\n                            \n            Player of the YearSarah Strong, UConnSarah Strong, UConnSarah Strong, UConnFreshman of the YearAaliyah Chavez, OklahomaAaliyah Chavez, OklahomaAaliyah Chavez, OklahomaDefensive Player of the YearSarah Strong, UConnHannah Hidalgo, Notre DameSarah Strong, UConnMost Improved PlayerGabriela Jaquez, UCLAJordan Lee, TexasAva Heiden, IowaCoach of the YearShea Ralph, VanderbiltGeno Auriemma, UConnShea Ralph, VanderbiltFirst-team All-AmericanSarah Strong, Mikayla Blakes,   Lauren Betts, Madison Booker, Olivia MilesSarah Strong, Madison Booker, Azzi Fudd, Audi Crooks, Mikayla BlakesSarah Strong, Mikayla Blakes, Lauren Betts, Madison Booker, Hannah HidalgoExpert explanationsMaloney: Strong is running away with Player of the Year honors as the best player on the country's best team. She should also be recognized as the Defensive Player of the Year, though she has more competition on that front. Strong leads the country in defensive win shares (2.8) and defensive box score plus-minus (plus-13), is second in the country in Hakeem rate, which combines steal rate and block rate, (15%) and tied for third in defensive RAPM (6.1). \nThe Freshman of the Year race is tough to call. Aaliyah Chavez and Aubrey Galvan are doing the most for contending teams, Jazzy Davidson has been forced to carry USC on her back and Lauren Whittaker is putting up the best stats against the weakest competition. This one really could go any way, but Chavez has the slight edge right now, especially after her brilliant performance in Oklahoma's upset win over South Carolina.  There shouldn't be much debate about Vanderbilt's Shea Ralph as Coach of the Year. She has the Commodores off to a 20-0 start that no one saw coming. Most Improved Player was another difficult pick due to the vast number of candidates. Gabriela Jaquez earned the nod for the major strides she's made, particularly as a shooter. She's scoring 14.8 points per game on 48.5% from 3-point range (both career-highs), which has not only helped the Bruins start off 18-1, but turned her into a first-round WNBA prospect.Gonzalez: The easiest choices for these awards were Sarah Strong for Player of the Year and Geno Auriemma as Coach of the Year. UConn looks like the most dominant team in the nation and the fact that we often talk about how the Huskies can go undefeated says a lot about the leadership of this group. As for Jordan Lee being Most Improved, she has shone in a bigger role this season, particularly as a consistent shooter, which was something Texas lacked last year.\nDespite Notre Dame struggling during this rebuilding season, the way Hannah Hidalgo disrupts opponents is still impressive enough to earn her Defensive Player of the Year. Meanwhile, the Freshman of the Year race didn't have a clear leader up until Thursday night. Aaliyah Chavez changed that with her ability to take over in Oklahoma's overtime win against South Carolina.Gibbs: Sarah Strong is obviously the Player of the Year and Aaliyah Chavez's OT explosion against South Carolina on Thursday night put her ahead in the Freshman of the Year conversation, at least at this midseason point. We will know much more about Vanderbilt after they play South Carolina on Sunday, but at this moment, Shea Ralph is clearly the Coach of the Year. Not not many expected the Commodores to take such a big step forward this season, especially after Khamil Pierre transferred out.I bounced around Hannah Hidalgo and Lauren Betts for Defensive Player of the Year, but Strong leading the country in defensive win shares ultimately swayed me to the UConn star once again. I could make an argument for about 15 players as Most Improved, including Ava Heiden's Iowa teammate Chazadi \"ChitChat\" Wright, but the way Heiden went from being a rotation afterthought her freshman year to a bonafide star running mate to Hannah Stuelke in the Hawkeyes' frontcourt this season, averaging 16.3 points and 7.7 rebounds a game, really stood out to me. Hidalgo earned my final spot in the first-team All-American list because, despite Notre Dame's struggles, she is third in the nation in scoring with 24.6 points per game, and leads the nation with 5.7 steals per game  -- a staggering 1.5 steals per game more than anyone else in women's college basketball.\nConference champion predictionsConference champion predictions\n                    \n    \n

it's really hard to imagine someone beating this UConn team right now. They have everything a team needs to win a national championship: elite talent leading the way (Sarah Strong and Azzi Fudd), an excellent coach (Geno Auriemma), a top-level defense (69.7 defensive rating, 1st in the country), strong outside shooting (39% from 3-point range, 4th in the country) and plenty of depth. The Huskies are a tier above everyone else, and have a real chance to pull off their seventh perfect season.Gonzalez: I really struggled with picking the fourth team for the Final Four because UCLA has really proven itself too. However, Kim Mulkey has a lot of talent on her roster and the way LSU bounced back from an 0-2 start in SEC play shows how dangerous the Tigers can be when they truly lock in.The Big Ten and ACC regular season champions were not too difficult to decide, but the SEC is too deep for an obvious winner. The Longhorns got my vote because of how tough they've played all season. Their two losses have been to LSU and South Carolina, and those were on the road and only by a combined eight points. \nAs for the Big 12, this conference has taken us on a roller coaster ride. Earlier in the season I would have picked Iowa State, but the Cyclones' recent struggles have opened the door for other competition. Although Baylor seems to have the most momentum right now, the fight TCU has shown in tight games could give the Horned Frogs an edge as the season continues to develop.Gibbs: I was the lone person from our team not to pick UConn to win it all in the preseason, and while I am still pretty high on Texas' potential, especially if the Longhorns can get and stay healthy, UConn just looks head and shoulders above everyone else. I feel pretty good about my Final Four picks of UConn and UCLA, but right now it's a bit of a toss-up as to which two SEC teams I think will join them. Ultimately, I leaned towards the ceilings of LSU and Texas, but strongly considered South Carolina, too. For the conference picks, UCLA was the only one that wasn't a tough call at this point of the season. Duke will threaten Louisville, but I think Louisville's depth gives them the edge, and while the SEC feels like a complete question mark, I'm sticking with my faith in Texas.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Even in his 18th NBA season, Kevin Durant remains one of the league's most dominant scorers, ranking 12th at 26.1 points per game in his first year with the Houston Rockets. However, playing on back-to-back nights can be a difficult proposition at 37 years old, and with the Rockets traveling to a new city off a grueling 128-122 overtime loss to the 76ers on Thursday, the SportsLine Projection Model is expecting Durant to fall shy of his season average on Friday night against the Pistons.

However, Durant has failed to reach 20 points in two of his last three games, and he's coming off a 36-point performance in 44 minutes in an overtime loss to the 76ers on Thursday. At age 37, though, that many minutes on the front end of a back-and-back can take a toll, and Durant goes against a top-three defense on Friday. The Rockets play the Pistons, who are third in the league in scoring defense. The model projects Durant for 22.4 points in 35 minutes, both below his season averages, in this short turnaround. FanDuel offers the best odds on Durant's Under at -118 odds.Bet on Durant with the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks, Over 6.5 assists (-115)The 31-year-old had seven assists in his last game on Wednesday, and he has at least five assists in six of his last seven games to at least consistently finish near this total. The Bucks play the Nuggets, who could be fatigued and resting some key starters in the second half of a back-to-back. Denver has multiple players battling injuries over the last few weeks and continues to play without Nikola Jokic (knee). Antetokounmpo is averaging six assists per game at home this season, but going against a fatigued, depleted Denver team should help him add at least one dime to that average to go Over on Friday. The model projects Antetokounmpo for 7.1 assists on Friday, and you can find the best odds at BetMGM.Bet on Antetokounmpo with the latest BetMGM bonus code CBSSPORTS, which gives new users up to $1,500 back in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Shaedon Sharpe, Trail Blazers, Under 22.5 points (-108)The No. 7 overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft has increased his scoring in each of his first four NBA seasons, and he's averaging 21.9 ppg this year, up from 18.5 ppg last season. He's scored 27 points in back-to-back games and has gone Over in four straight contests. But he went Under this number in three of four games before the most recent streak. The Trail Blazers play the Raptors, who have the sixth-best scoring defense in the league, and have allowed fewer than 110 points in three of their last six games. The model projects Sharpe for 18.5 points on Friday, and FanDuel offers the best odds on his Under.Bet on Sharpe with the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Want more Friday NBA picks?You've seen the model's NBA picks for some popular NBA player props for Friday.

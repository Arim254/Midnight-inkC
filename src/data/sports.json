    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> quarterback room has dominated headlines throughout 2025. Going back to the spring, the franchise double-dipped at the position in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26710004/shedeur-sanders/\">Shedeur Sanders</a>. They were then part of a four-player quarterback battle this summer that also included <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804969/kenny-pickett/\">Kenny Pickett</a>. Both of those veterans have since been traded, and the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-trade-joe-flacco-to-bengals-cincinnati-acquires-veteran-qb-from-division-rival-in-late-round-pick-swap/\" target=\"_blank\">Flacco deal to Cincinnati</a></span> that went down on Tuesday comes just a week after he was benched in place of Gabriel. It's enough to give any Browns fan whiplash when trying to keep up with the position group. </p><p>And then there's the \"other\" Browns quarterback: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2133482/deshaun-watson/\">Deshaun Watson</a>. Remember him? </p><p>He was supposed to be the franchise's savior, but his off-the-field issues, coupled with poor play when he was on the field (9-10 as Cleveland's starter), have made his acquisition arguably the worst trade in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history. That's particularly true given his unprecedented $230 million fully guaranteed extension that was agreed to following the trade to the Browns. </p><p>He's still with the team, albeit on the physically unable to perform list as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury. Watson initially suffered the injury during Cleveland's Week 7 matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> last season. Then, underwent surgery in January of this year after he re-ruptured his right Achilles. </p><p>Given the volatility that the Browns quarterback room is currently experiencing, it's fair to ask if Watson could be the latest quarterback to enter the conversation if he's closer to returning to form. </p>\n<h2>How is Deshaun Watson's recovery going? </h2><p>Again, Watson is looking to get back onto the field after multiple ruptures to his Achilles, with the most recent coming this offseason, so he has an uphill battle to climb on the rehab front. Watson has continued to chronicle his recovery on social media, and multiple video clips do show the veteran quarterback sprinting, dropping back, and throwing passes. </p><p>These clips below were from August. </p>\n<h2>Will Deshaun Watson play in 2025?</h2><p>In the lead-up to Dillon Gabriel's first NFL start on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/examining-browns-qb-room-dillon-gabriel-joe-flacco-shedeur-sanders\" target=\"_blank\">NFL Media</a> reported that Watson, who has his entire 2026 salary already guaranteed, would be part of the Browns' evaluation of the quarterback position and future planning around it, if he ends up on the field at some point this season. However, the report also notes that Watson playing in 2025 is considered unlikely. <a href=\"https://x.com/ScottPetrak/status/1975264512812196070\" target=\"_blank\">The Chronicle-Telegram's Scott Petrak</a> also noted on Monday that Cleveland would not be opening up Watson's practice window this week, leading up to the team's Week 6 matchup vs. Pittsburgh. </p>\n<p>Even if Watson is activated off of PUP and begins practicing with the Browns at some point this season, it's no guarantee that they'd slot him in as a starter in 2025. As the team figures out what they have, Sanders may warrant a look over Watson if Gabriel fades as Cleveland would likely want to get a firm look at their other first-year signal-caller over a known commodity in Watson. </p>\n            </div>",

Yes finally.               </p><p>The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. <strong>Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart. </strong>              </p><p>By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, <strong>Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has <em>two or more</em> players than the other</strong>. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).              </p>\n<p>This list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.               </p><p>Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/all/articles/?authorId=3828\" target=\"_blank\">updated projected rest of season schedule rankings</a> available on SportsLine later this week.                   </p>\n<p>You can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at <strong>drichard@cbs.com</strong> or at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daverichard\" target=\"_blank\">@daverichard on X</a>.                            </p><h3>              Running back              </h3><table><tbody><tr><td>\t\t\t\t<strong>player</strong></td><td>\t\t\t\t<strong>tm</strong></td><td>\t\t\t\t<strong>non</strong></td><td>\t\t\t\t<strong>0.5</strong></td><td>\t\t\t\t<strong>PPR</strong></td></tr><tr><td>B.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League kicked off on Tuesday with the league phase, and the new era didn't disappoint. There were heavyweight clashes and massive individual performances, setting a thrilling tone for an exciting season ahead. The opening night was headlined by a marquee rematch of last season's semifinal between OL Lyonnes and Arsenal, and this time the French club defeated the Gunners 2-1. </p><p>Elsewhere, Champions League regulars FC Barcelona made a stellar statement against German giants Bayern Munich with a resounding 7-1 victory. Opening week continues with more games on Wednesday, as Chelsea FC open against Twente, and Paris Saint-Germain meet Wolfsburg. CBS Sports is the official home of the UWCL, and fans can watch every match across <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\">Paramount+</a>  with select games on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/ny3ywBQBBjb\">CBS Sports Network</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e\">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a>.</p><h2>Scores</h2><p>Juventus 2, Benfica 1<br />OL Lyonnes 2, Arsenal 1<br />Barcelona 7, Bayern Munich 1<br />Paris FC 2, OH Leuven 2</p><h2>Juventus vs. Benfica</h2><p>Serie A side Juventus got off to a solid start in the league phase. Plenty of activity in dangerous spaces by veterans Cristina Girelli and Barbara Bonansea, but it was defender Cecilia Salvai who was the star of the match.</p>\n<p>The two goals are Salvai's first of her career and her first goals in the UWCL in 28 appearances for the 31-year-old defender. Bonansea recorded her 7th UWCL career assist. </p><h2>Arsenal vs. OL Lyonnes</h2><p>Current title holders Arsenal drew a huge challenge with their opening league phase game against eight-time Champions League winners OL Lyonnes. The North London side have a target on them as they navigate the new tournament format, and there might be a bit of fortune in facing their toughest opponent early in the competition. </p><p>Despite an early opening goal by Alessia Russo, her 11th career UWCL goal, the Gunners immediately felt the pressure from OL. A huge momentum shift by Haitian international Melchie Dumornay was the difference maker. The forward scored two goals in five minutes to zap any control of the game that Arsenal had in the first half. </p>\n<p>The French side cranked up the attack and Arsenal's defensive efforts to sustain the attacking waves paid off. Goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar delivered a double save in stoppage time to keep the game narrow and allow the squad to regroup at halftime.</p>\n<p>Despite impressive attacking collaboration between Melchie Dumornay, Kadidiatou Diani, Marie Antoinette Katoto, and Tabitha Chawinga, the finishing betrayed them. Arsenal's elevated effort in the second half stifled some of the potential threats, but it never translated into the extra momentum for an equalizer. A good start for OL's journey back to the knockouts while Arsenal's questionable form continues.  </p><h2>FC Barcelona vs. Bayern Munich</h2><p>Last season's runners-up FC Barcelona stepped into their opening league phase match with a purpose. The Catalonian side made a statement in their 7-1 win over Bayern Munich on Tuesday. Midfielder Alexia Putellas kicked off the goalscoring with a stunner from distance just four minutes into the game. </p>\n<p>Bayern Munich had zero answers for the Champions League juggernauts, down 5-1 by halftime. </p><p>\"This is an absolute nightmare from Bayern. I honestly expected so much more from them, but they're just they're soft. They're not defending. They're late to every play. They're allowing Barcelona all the time in space. They're not cutting off the passing lanes. It's just a nightmare. They gotta adjust,\" said UWCL analyst Janelly Farias during halftime.</p><p>Unfortunately, the adjustments past the hour mark weren't enough for the Bavarian squad. They conceded two more goals in a sloppy, terrible performance and they were never in the mix. The club's lone goal scorer, Klara Buhl, emphasized the need for a better performance by the team.</p>\n<p>\"It was really hard. We thought that we could have maybe a bit more of the ball, that we had our own actions to get to the goal, to get some chances. But yeah, I think this night, it's, it's really, really tough. They played the great game. They created a lot of chances, and we were just, yeah, a bit passive every time we went too late. I think this was one, yeah, I think that we were not good enough,\" Buhl said.</p><p>\"I think this is Champions League, and that's, that's the good thing about it, that we have opponents. They're great, they're the highest level. Of course, we want to play these games, but in a different way. But I think that's why we have to reflect on it. We have to take the right solutions out of it, and then prepare for the next game and show a different face.\"</p><h2>Paris FC vs. OH Leuven</h2><p>UEFA Women's Champions League debutants OH Leuven checked off several tournament firsts and marked their arrival with a come-from-behind draw against Paris FC. The first-ever Belgian side to compete in the tournament rallied in the second half to earn their first point of the competition. </p>\n<h2>What's next</h2><p><strong>Wednesday, Oct. 8<br /></strong>Twente vs. Chelsea, 12:45 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)  <br />Real Madrid vs. Roma, 12:45 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)  <br />Man Utd vs. Vålerenga, 3 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)    <br />St. Pölten vs. Atlético de Madrid, 3 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)    <br />Wolfsburg vs. PSG 3 p.m. (<a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>)    </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\">Paramount+</a> will be a one-stop shop for all things Champions League, while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/ny3ywBQBBjb\">CBS Sports Network</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/cbs-sports-golazo-network?ftag=CBS-03-10ade4e\">CBS Sports Golazo Network</a> will have select matches and additional coverage.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. --  Even after throttling a then-top 10 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ILL/illinois-fighting-illini/\">Illinois</a> in Week 4, the narrative hasn't fully gone away for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a>.</p><p>All last season the Hoosiers had to fight back against a notion that they didn't play tough competition on their way to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff berth. Indiana was the surprise story of the 2024 season, ripping off 10 consecutive wins to start the Curt Cignetti tenure at a place known as a basketball-first school.</p><p>That 10-0 start included wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a>, but the critics painted Indiana as a paper tiger. That criticism only amplified when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> beat Indiana, 38-15, and every flaw came under the microscope during playoff campaigning season. </p><p>Add in a 27-17 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> in the CFP opener and it was easy to hand-wave Indiana away as a pretender. Few expected Indiana to be back in the playoff hunt again this season, an easy regression candidate for those who didn't believe in the Hoosiers' magical run a season ago.</p>\n<p>And, yet, No. 7 Indiana is very much in the hunt for a playoff spot midway through the season. The Hoosiers (5-0) have a chance to prove the criticism is outdated if they can get a challenging road win over No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> this weekend (3:30 p.m. ET on CBS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/college-football/?ftag=CBS-03-10ada3a\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/Mleetu8HWsb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a>, <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a>).</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/b1g-time-indiana-meets-oregon-for-early-leg-up-in-cfp-race-obvious-missing-link-limiting-penn-state/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>B1G Time: Indiana meets Oregon for early leg up in CFP race, obvious missing link limiting Penn State</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Nagel                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"B1G Time: Indiana meets Oregon for early leg up in CFP race, obvious missing link limiting Penn State\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/7e7acfd9-81fe-4383-9f3c-bca4e4797a2f/thumbnail/270x152/fbb66b017e36f1be892ff0abfbd38fd2/mendoza.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Inside the Indiana program, there is a strong belief that the Hoosiers can compete with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football's</a> elite teams. When reviewing last year's two losses, Indiana coaches were more encouraged than discouraged about where their program stood. </p><p>\"I still feel like I left both of those games thinking, 'Man, we weren't that far off,'\" defensive coordinator Bryant Haines told CBS Sports this offseason. \"I felt like the margin of error was just so small. I think we can compete with those teams and I thought we did compete well in moments. I think if anything, it validated us. We can beat Ohio State. I still think we can.\" </p>\n<p>The Notre Dame playoff loss was the tougher pill to swallow. Indiana gave up a 98-yard touchdown run to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133405/jeremiyah-love/\">Jeremiyah Love</a> early in the first quarter that immediately put it behind the eight-ball at Notre Dame. The offense that dominated the competition all season was stymied by Al Golden's defense. By the fourth quarter, it was 27-3 and the result was clear. Indiana made the final score a bit more respectable with two late touchdowns, but it crystallized to some that Indiana didn't belong. </p><p>That loss, of course, looked better as time went on as the Fighting Irish made it all the way to the national championship game with wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a>. Still, there was no getting around Indiana went 0-2 against the two best teams it played in 2024. There were lessons in those defeats, though. </p><p>\"Notre Dame I was really disappointed with the way we played but we learned what we needed, sort of personnel wise, to take the next step,\" Cignetti told CBS Sports this offseason. \"I think the positive thing about Notre Dame was a bitter taste left in everybody's mouths headed into this year. You didn't have those warm fuzzy feelings like you had a great year.\"</p>\n<p>Part of what Indiana needed was actually in that game on the opposing sideline. Offensive lineman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26713460/pat-coogan/\">Pat Coogan</a>, who has been the key cog to Indiana's O-line this season, started for Notre Dame in that game. In Indiana's hard-fought 20-15 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a> two weeks ago, Coogan had the best pass-blocking grade out of any Power Four center, according to Pro Football Focus. </p><figure><p><img alt=\"COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SEP 20 Illinois at Indiana\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/2a60b09f-b7f0-49cd-9748-854262bc7f03/resize/670x377/7d435e0706eea700c070db95ab2517da/coogan.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>Indiana center Pat Coogan (78), who transferred from Notre Dame in the offseason, has been among the Hoosiers' top impact newcomers of 2025. </span><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not just Coogan who has elevated Indiana to another level this season.

It's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland</a> transfer running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26700412/roman-hemby/\">Roman Hemby</a>, who leads the team with 351 rushing yards.

On both sides of the ball, Indiana made smart transfer additions to an already talented returning roster. </p><p>Indiana didn't just step up financially to improve its roster. The program fended off rival suitors for Haines and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/indianas-fernando-mendoza-illinois-luke-altmyer-are-both-dynamic-qbs-meet-the-two-men-trying-to-stop-them/\" target=\"_blank\">made him one of the nation's highest-paid assistant coaches</a></span>. Cignetti engenders real loyalty from a staff that has followed him up the ranks, some all the way back to IUP, but it still takes real financial resources to keep that group intact. </p>\n<p>Under Cignetti, Indiana is all-in on football not only because the results are there on and off the field (ticket sales are up more than 50% year-over-year) but because it no longer feels farfetched that Indiana could compete for a national championship.</p><p>\"We believe in (his blueprint), he believes in it and we continue to work on it every day,\" Indiana AD Scott Dolson told CBS Sports. \"That's how we feel we'll have consistent success.\"</p><p>Saturday's road showdown against Oregon won't make or break this season for Indiana. The remainder of the schedule feels very manageable again, with the toughest tests likely coming against 4-1 Maryland and a 3-2 Penn State team that just lost to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>. A loss Saturday and Indiana could be in the same boat as it was a year ago with a 11-1 record and criticism that it just beat up on lesser teams on the way to the playoffs.</p>\n<p>This team is more talented and better prepared than it was a year ago. It has a difficult road win over Iowa under its belt. The defense ranks top-10 nationally in scoring defense (No. 3), total defense (No. 5) and pass defense (No. 7). All of that will be put to the test against the Dante Moore-led Oregon offense that is averaging 46.6 points and 503.8 yards per game. The Ducks have the most talented roster Indiana has faced this season, one that Cignetti himself <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/the-race-to-keep-up-with-40-million-rosters-is-shaking-college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">told CBS Sports earlier this year </a></span>was in rarefied air of roster costs. The top end of the college football ecosystem were $40 million rosters, according to the coach. </p><p>When you play the game's top teams like Oregon, it is a \"game of inches,\" Haines says, \"and we have to win those inches.\" </p><p>Indiana will soon find out if its lessons from its losses a year ago will lead to the breakthrough its coaches believe possible, or instead have to suffer through the same narrative that hung over their success last season. </p>\n            </div>",

This week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3126952/jacory-croskey-merritt/fantasy/\">Jacory Croskey-Merritt</a> joined the party. It is fair to wonder whether this spike week will go the way that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3171045/woody-marks/fantasy/\">Woody Marks</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121207/rj-harveys/fantasy/\">RJ Harvey's</a> did last week. Those two rookies combined for 47.7 PPR Fantasy points in Week 4 and 8.4 in Week 5. I do not believe we should expect the same outcome with Croskey-Merritt.</p><p>For one thing, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/WAS/washington-commanders/\">Commanders</a> signaled a big change in the first quarter of this game. Croskey-Merritt did not have a single first quarter carry in the first four games of the season. He had the Commanders' first three running back carries in the first quarter in Week 5. Also, on the broadcast, it was mentioned multiple times that Washington had an expectation that Croskey-Merritt would take this job over at some point in the near future. Finally, when Croskey-Merritt fumbled late in the game, he was not punished, and instead, he received the next carry.</p><p>I don't think the Commanders' rookie running back is going backwards any time soon. The question now is how much further he can go. In Week 16, he played a career-high 47.5% of the snaps. If his ceiling remains half the snaps, then he will be an upside-down RB2 rest of the season. If that climbs closer to 70%, he could be a borderline RB1. I am more likely to buy high on Croskey-Merritt than sell high. </p><p>Now let's get to the rest of the Week 6 RB Preview:</p>\n<h6>\n        Week 6 RB Preview\n    </h6>\n<p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    RB Preview\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Numbers to know\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><ul><li><strong>6.6 </strong>-- Croskey-Merritt's 6.6 yards per carry leads the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>.

Warren to get his job back when he's healthy. But until that happens, Gainwell needs to be rostered. He had a role before Warren went down and could be a bye-week replacement as the 1B in Pittsburgh against the right matchup. This week against the Browns is probably not that matchup, unless Warren is out again.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><p>Stashes (RB

Now he's 65% rostered, so I did not include him, but go get him if he's available. Smith has seen seven targets in the past two weeks and caught six of them for 59 yards. He's not playing enough snaps to be viable yet, but Andy Reid is notorious for easing rookies in and then letting them loose in the second half. He is a great bench stash, and he is available in 75% of leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n

But people really do not like Kyren Williams. Everyone always wants their backup to get more work. In this game, the backup may get some work because the Rams face a Ravens defense that is getting gashed by both the pass and the run. They are also one of the worst teams against pass-catching running backs. It should not be a surprise if Kyren Williams is the top-scoring running back this week, and I do not expect his roster rate to reflect that.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    RB Preview\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Heath's Projections\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><p>My full set of Week 6 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/fantasy/football/\">Fantasy football</a> projections for every position are now available on SportsLine. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/fantasy-football-week-6-projections-for-2025-josh-allen-should-rebound-nicely-vs-falcons-porous-pass-defense/?ttag=SL23_lk_cbssports_cummings_positionpreview\" target=\"_blank\">You'll find them here</a>.

The All-Pro running back has been listed on the team's injury report this week with a knee issue. </p><p>Barkley received a \"did not participate\" designation on Monday before being labeled as limited during Tuesday's practice, which was an estimate as Philadelphia didn't practice either day. </p><p>While he understands the outside buzz his injury status created over the past two days, Barkley feels it is being widely overblown. </p><p>\"I know a lot of people are reacting because it said I wouldn't practice,\" <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/eagles-giants-injury-report-saquon-barkley-jaxson-dart-landon-dickerson\" target=\"_blank\">he said</a> Tuesday. \"None of us practiced yesterday. I know the Eagles are doing what they're supposed to do, but nothing (I'm) too worried about. Just some general soreness. I'm excited to go play.\" </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/did-eagles-forget-about-saquon-barkley-offensive-frustrations-could-be-extending-to-rb/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Did Eagles forget about Saquon Barkley?

Barkley rushed for 30 yards on just six carries but did have a 47-yard touchdown reception. On the heels of his historic 2024 season, Barkley and the Philly offense have been inconsistent despite a 3-1 record. Barkley has only 267 yards on 83 carries -- a 3.2-yard average. </p><p>After blowing a 17-3 lead in the Denver loss, the Eagles have a quick turnaround for Thursday against the Giants, where Barkley spent the first six seasons of his career. While there are several injury questions regarding the Eagles, Barkley made it clear he is confident that he can play at his usual level against his former team. In his only previous game against the Giants, Barkley ran for 176 yards and a score while helping lead the Eagles to a 28-3 win. </p><p>Along with Barkley, linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28875305/jihaad-campbell/\">Jihaad Campbell</a> (biceps) and defensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123718/byron-young/\">Byron Young</a> (triceps) were labeled as limited participants on Tuesday. Linebacker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123073/nakobe-dean/\">Nakobe Dean</a> (knee) -- who hasn't played this season after tearing his left patellar tendon during the Eagles' 2024 postseason run -- was a full participant. </p>\n<p>Conversely, tight end <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804129/grant-calcaterra/\">Grant Calcaterra</a> (oblique) and guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2253017/landon-dickerson/\">Landon Dickerson</a> (ankle) received \"did not participate\" labels for a second consecutive day. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

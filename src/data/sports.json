    "body": "\n        Teams on the fringe of the NFC playoffs will wrap up Week 12 as the San Francisco 49ers host the Carolina Panthers on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. The over/under in this matchup is 49.5, up two points from the opening line. San Fran's offense runs through former Panthers standout Christian McCaffrey as daily Fantasy managers always have him top-of-mind when making NFL DFS picks. But the Niners also have the No. 2 passing offense, which makes Brock Purdy, Ricky Pearsall and George Kittle, all back in the lineup after recent injuries, desirable for NFL DFS lineups, despite their injury-plagued seasons. As for Carolina, its top-10 rushing attack makes the backfield tandem of Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard an intriguing MNF DFS stack.Any NFL daily strategy must include affordable options to balance out the big names with big price tags. Can Bryce Young, coming off a 448-yard, 3-TD game, be one of those options amongst the NFL DFS player pool?

Since coming off IR in October, Kittle has looked every bit like the six-time Pro Bowler he is. He has four touchdowns over his last four games, also averaging 5.8 receptions and 56.5 yards over this span. He's been the TE2 in Fantasy during this stretch and has at least five catches in all three career games versus Carolina. This year's Panthers have struggled defending tight ends, as just six teams have allowed more receiving yards to tight ends than Carolina, while only seven teams have allowed more touchdowns to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Panthers RB Rico Dowdle, who is averaging over 100 scrimmage yards with three total touchdowns over his last three games. He's clearly unseated Chuba Hubbard as Carolina's No. 1 RB, as the latter hasn't had more than five carries over this three-game stretch. Dowdle entered Week 12 ranking fourth in rushing yards (833) and eighth in scrimmage yards (1,030), and one shouldn't overlook the impact he could have out of the backfield. He tied a career high with five catches last week, going for 55 yards, and only one team has allowed more receptions to running backs this year than San Fran. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy threw three interceptions across his team's first four drives against the Carolina Panthers. It's the first time a player has thrown three interceptions on his team's first four offensive drives of a game since Purdy did it on Christmas Day, 2023.Purdy started off the game well enough as San Francisco marched down the field methodically, covering 72 yards on 15 plays, and Purdy found Jauan Jennings for a 12-yard touchdown. Then things started to fall apart. Deep in his own territory, Purdy tried a deep ball down the middle to Jennings, but the ball came out late and didn't have enough velocity, allowing Jaycee Horn to step in front.\nThe 49ers defense got a goal-line stand, with Ji'Ayir Brown picking off Bryce Young, but Purdy gave it back again, this time trying for Ricky Pearsall in the end zone. Mike Jackson made the athletic grab.\nPurdy completed the unwanted trifecta when Horn undercut a ball intended for Pearsall. Unlike the first two throws, this one was more of a case of Purdy being fooled by the coverage, as the replay below shows: Horn came across the field to earn the takeaway.\nPurdy has missed much of the season due to injury. He suffered a \"variant of turf toe\" as well as a shoulder injury in Week 1 and returned in Week 4 -- only to aggravate the turf toe injury. The 49ers went 5-3 with Mac Jones as the starter, but coach Kyle Shanahan was unequivocal when reinstating Purdy as starter ahead of Week 11.\"We've got a lot of confidence in Brock, and we know Brock will play at a high level too as long as he's healthy.\"The second part of that statement hasn't been true, though. Purdy has multiple interceptions in three of his four games this season, and through the first half, he had just one touchdown compared to seven interceptions on throws 15 or more yards downfield.\nThe 49ers led 10-3 at halftime, making Purdy the first quarterback to lead by at least seven points at halftime despite throwing three first-half interceptions since Ben Roethlisberger in 2018.\n            ",

Chase, who initially denied spitting on Ramsey, will play in Cincinnati's Thanksgiving Day game against the Ravens after he served his suspension for a Week 12 loss to the New England Patriots. \"What I did was wrong,\" Chase said in a statement he posted on Instagram. \"The circumstances don't matter. My passion for the game is no excuse. There's zero place in our sport -- or life -- for that level of disrespect.\" Chase apologized \"to everyone within the Pittsburgh Steelers organization.\" He also extended an apology to his coaches, teammates, the Bengals' organization and his fans while vowing that he \"won't let it happen again.\" \n\"I do not take anyone who wears my jersey for granted,\" he said. \"I do not take my position as a role model lightly. As someone who strives to lead with character and authenticity, I should have taken immediate accountability for what happened. I am committed to earning back your respect -- not just with words, but with my actions, day after day, on and off the field.\" \nWith his suspension behind him, Chase will now resume the task of helping the 3-8 Bengals get back on track, staring with Thursday night's road game against the Ravens. Helping his cause will be the return of Joe Burrow, who is slated to play for the first time since he suffered turf toe back in Week 2. \nThe Bengals will not, however, have fellow wideout Tee Higgins against the Ravens after he sustained a concussion during this past Sunday's loss to the Patriots. \n            \n    ",

The Big Ten seeks multiple automatic qualifiers for its conference, while the SEC prefers more at-large spots, which would historically favor the SEC. The CFP's decision-making power is weighted in favor of the Big Ten and SEC, and both must agree on a format to move forward.There is growing confidence that the playoff will remain at 12 teams during the 2026-27 season, sources said, though an extended deadline allows more time to digest data and selection trends in the second year of the 12-team format, which could spark renewed discussions around 16- and 24-team brackets. Selection Sunday this season is set for Dec. 7, six days after the initial deadline.\nThe CFP's management committee is scheduled to meet virtually Dec. 2. The CFP's annual wrap-up meeting for the season is scheduled for Jan. 18 in Miami, the site of the national championship game on Jan. 19. It's believed the new deadline could extend beyond that meeting.The Big Ten has supported a new 24-team format with multiple automatic qualifiers since August, but its proposal has received pushback as a viable plan in the 11th hour of discussions. Another proposal that would reward four autobids to each of the four power conferences has garnered interest in the ACC and Big 12, but there have been few formal discussions as the conferences' leadership focuses on implementation of revenue sharing and the launch of the College Sports Commission, the new governing arm overseeing terms of the recently-settled House v. NCAA lawsuit.The SEC has leaned toward a 16-team field.\nESPN's new contract with the CFP spans from 2026-33 when executed.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Everyone wants to be in business with Caitlin Clark, even NBA superstars like Stephen Curry. According to a new report from Bloomberg, Under Armour's inability to sign Clark played a role in Curry's long-term relationship with the brand deteriorating before ultimately ending earlier this month. Curry had been with Under Armour since 2013, prior to his ascension to the top of the sport, but the two sides parted ways earlier this month. Curry's standalone venture, \"Curry Brand,\" will continue independently, and, as a sneaker free agent, he is free to wear other brands. \"Under Armour believed in me early in my career and gave me the space to build something much bigger and more impactful than a shoe,\" Curry said in a press release. \"I'll always be grateful for that.\"While Under Armour believed in Curry earlier than most, the Warriors star and his camp had grown \"frustrated\" with the company in recent years. Via Bloomberg:\nCurry and his advisers became frustrated by what they viewed as underinvestment in the brand, according to people familiar with the situation who asked to not be identified because details of the relationship are private. Meanwhile, the division's sales weren't meeting the company's or Curry's expectations, the people said.Part of Curry's frustration reportedly stemmed from Under Armour's failed attempt to sign Clark when the women's basketball phenom was on the market early last year. Clark ultimately signed an eight-year, $28 million deal with Nike, which included a signature shoe. Here's Bloomberg again:One sore point for Curry was the attempt last year to recruit Caitlin Clark to join his brand, according to people familiar with the matter. He and the company pursued the phenom, but Under Armour's offer trailed the total value of Nike's pitch, the people said. Clark, now a star in the WNBA, opted to sign with Nike.After Clark signed with Nike, The Wall Street Journal reported the respective offers she received at the time. While Under Armour's offer was better on a per-year basis, it was significantly shorter than Nike's offer. Caitlin Clark's reported shoe deal offersCompanyOfferNike8 years, $28 millionUnder Armour4 years, $16 million Adidas4 years, $6 millionPumaWalked awayIn August, Nike made Clark a \"Signature Athlete,\" introduced her unique logo and confirmed that her first signature shoe will be released in 2026. Sneaker insider and expert Nick DePaula told Front Office Sports that the shoe could be worth over $100 million to Nike. However much Nike ends up making on Clark's shoe, it will be far more than the $28 million they gave her -- nevermind what they make on merchandise and Clark's \"Player Edition\" shoes. \nUnder Armour's decision to not do whatever it took to sign Clark -- one of the most popular athletes in America with a rabid fanbase -- seemed short-sighted at the time. It only looks worse now that Curry has walked as well. \n            ",

Mayfield did not play the rest of the game and spent the second half in a sling as Tampa Bay lost its third straight.Monday's MRI has revealed that Mayfield has sustained a low-grade strain, according to NFL Media. This means that Tampa Bay could get Mayfield back as early as Sunday's game against the Cardinals.The Buccaneers (6-5) started the season 6-2 overall, but this rough patch in recent weeks squandered their lead in the NFC South. Now tied with the Carolina Panthers at the top of the division, the Buccaneers are the No. 4 seed in the NFC with six games to play. Tampa Bay is gunning for its sixth straight divisional crown, but Mayfield's availability is paramount to reaching the postseason.Mayfield threw a touchdown pass and two interceptions in the first half of Sunday's loss in Los Angeles before exiting the game. He was the league's leading MVP candidate through the first six games before the schedule stiffened.The Buccaneers host the Cardinals, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons over the next three weeks as they turn to Teddy Bridgewater if Mayfield is sidelined. Mayfield experienced pain in his non-throwing shoulder before in his career after tearing his labrum during the 2021 season.\nA shoulder sprain usually takes a few weeks to heal, but quarterbacks have returned in short order with rest as well.\"You never want to see guys injured, especially your leader,\" Bridgewater said. \"But Baker's a tough guy, man. He tried to come back out there and tough it out for the guys. That says a lot about him.\"Now in his third seasons with the Buccaneers, Mayfield made 45 consecutive starts and has not missed a game since 2022 when a high ankle sprain with the Panthers caused him to miss time. \nMayfield has thrown for 2,406 yards and 18 touchdowns this season with a 60.8 QBR, the second-highest rating of his career.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Georgia coach Kirby Smart dismissed offensive lineman Nyier Daniels Monday after authorities arrested the redshirt freshman Sunday in Jackson County. Daniels faces multiple felony and misdemeanor charges following an incident in which he allegedly fled law enforcement, according to jail records provided to WXIA-TV. Daniels' mother, Brandi Canada-Green, was also charged with one felony and five misdemeanor charges in the incident.\"I have not had a chance to talk to him or his family, but obviously he'll no longer be with us,\" Smart said in his Monday media availability.Daniels, who appeared in his third game during Saturday's 35-3 win against Charlotte, was booked at 10 a.m. local time with four pending felonies -- fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, affixing materials that alter window transparency and two counts of second-degree cruelty to children. He also faces multiple misdemeanor traffic charges, including reckless driving, speeding, stop-sign violations and no-passing-zone infractions.The police incident report, obtained by ESPN, states that an officer stopped Canada-Green for running a stop sign and that Daniels then passed the officer at more than 100 mph in a 25 mph zone. The officer left Canada-Green to pursue Daniels, and the former allegedly used her vehicle to block the officer's supervisor from joining in the chase.\nDaniels, who had siblings in his vehicle, allegedly drove more than 150 mph during the pursuit. Officers lost sight of his vehicle and pulled over, waited for Canada-Green to pass and arrested her.An official from the University of Georgia transported Daniels back to Commerce, Ga., where the Bulldogs football player turned himself into police.Daniels rated as a four-star prospect, per 247Sports, coming out of Oradell (N.J.) Bergen Catholic in the 2024 recruiting class. He ranked as the No. 223 overall prospect and No. 22 offensive tackle nationally.\nDaniels' arrest adds to a pattern of driving-related issues that have shadowed the Georgia football program for nearly three years, with more than 20 incidents involving players or staff since January 2023.

    "body": "\n        Matt Norlander is on the Vegas Strip and bouncing back and forth between the two arenas hosting this year's Players Era Championship. He'll be providing frequent updates and insider information throughout each day of the event, so check back in regularly. This is his Monday notebook.   LAS VEGAS — The Big 12 had a really good Monday in Las Vegas. The league started the day by announcing a landmark five-year deal worth purportedly at least $50 million in revenue with Players Era. I've got a lot more on that further down the story, so be sure to scroll down and scope the details.Let's open with the on-court stuff from Monday, though. The league went 4-0, albeit with four close games: Baylor beat Creighton (81-74), No. 15 Iowa State won out in a great fight against No. 14 St. John's (83-82), Kansas (without Darryn Peterson) got separation down the stretch against Notre Dame (71-61) and, the surprise of the day: third-ranked Houston needed overtime to beat Syracuse (78-74). In the preseason, I said on Eye on College Basketball that I thought the league would ascend back to its status at the No. 1 conference. There's a long way to go, but through Monday night, the Big 12 has six teams still undefeated and a collective record of 75-14. \nAnd with four of the nine teams that will be 1-0 after Monday's slate here at Players Era, the conference has a healthy shot to have the eventual winner come Wednesday night. We'll see what Tuesday brings, when Iowa State plays shorthanded Creighton, Baylor gets tested against St. John's, Kansas faces suddenly interesting Syracuse and Houston gets the biggest test of all: No. 17 Tennessee.You can check the tip times for all those games at the very bottom of this story. Let's tour through the other action I saw on Monday. ISU loses Lipsey to injury; St. John's PG concerns remain The theme coming out of Iowa State's 83-82 win over St. John's: point guard play. And lack thereof. \nIowa State's Tamin Lipsey went down with a tough shot to the groin area with 2:09 remaining, prompting him to sit the rest of the game. Lipsey, a senior, is one of the better floor generals in college basketball. His status is uncertain for Iowa State's Tuesday morning Vegas-time tilt against Creighton. \"We're still evaluating,\" ISU coach TJ Otzelberger said after the game. \"The training staff, medical staff, just told us it's going to be a day-to-day, lower body extremity, so I don't have great detail on it. We haven't had time to really, truly evaluate him over time. So we'll get back to the hotel, check him out and see what that means.\" I caught up with Otzelberger one-on-one after the presser and he told me the injury is on the opposite leg from the groin issue that beleaguered Lipsey last season. Given how soft-tissue/groin/hamstring injuries can be fickle, it would be no shock if Lipsey didn't play Tuesday, or even Wednesday.  \nBut we'll see. Thanks in part to one of the better games of Milan Momcilovic's career (23 points, 5-of-9 3-point shooting), ISU was able to win out without its point guard on the floor in the pivotal final two minutes. The win improved ISU to 5-0 and was the Clones' second victory against a Power Five school this season (Mississippi State is the other).  St. John's also didn't have its starter at the 1 available down the stretch. The Johnnies dropped to 3-2 with their second loss vs. a power-conference opponent (Alabama being the other), as the glaring weakness of not having a true high-major point guard reared its head. Dylan Darling, a transfer from Idaho State, got his first start of the season and wound up fouling out with just four points and three assists.  As St. John's and ISU traded blows in the final minutes, the Red Storm had a chance to tie and send it to OT, but Pitino opted not to call timeout on SJU's final possession. I asked Pitino afterward why the no-call and he dismissed the question, citing St. John's getting two stoppages in final minute of game time. Still, St. John's wound up with a busted play that led to center Zuby Ejiofor launching a prayer from deep that didn't fall. Dillon Mitchell put back an offensive board as time expired.  \n\"With the game on the line, we didn't come up with the rebounds to put the game away,\" Pitino said afterward.  And that was pretty much his talking point: losing out on box-outs and not winning enough of the physical, one-on-one battles. Despite being irked by the loss, Pitino said he wasn't disappointed in the team's effort — and in fact was satisfied with the overall execution of the offense against a quality opponent. \"I have no gripes with the way our guys played,\" he said. \"It's a disappointing loss, very disappointing loss for us. But we've got to do something. You can't lose the game by giving second shots up. You're not going to win games that way. So, we'll make the adjustments.\" \nIt's important to not overstate or knee-jerk on Day 1 of these three-day/game MTEs, but with that said, St. John's game on Tuesday vs. Baylor is a matchup to monitor. A preseason top-10 team, SJU would be one of the bigger disappointments of the first three weeks of the season if it leaves Las Vegas 1-2 or worse.   New-look Baylor passes test vs. Creighton One of the more under-discussed bizarre stories of the offseason was Scott Drew having to replace his entire roster. A high-major program flipping over every scholarship is the kind of thing that happens due to a coaching change.  For a coach with a national championship on his résumé, it was bizarre. He also hasn't complained, at least not to my knowledge, about being put in a predicament not coach wants to be in.  \nAnd because of all the turnover, Baylor didn't enter the season ranked. The Bears weren't even projected to be in the top six of the Big 12. The hesitation was understandable. Baylor slipped last season, after all (20-15, a No. 9 seed in the NCAAs). But in BU's second test of the season against a power-conference opponent, the new-look Bears looked pretty nice. Drew's team beat Creighton 81-74 in the lid-lifter at Michelob Ultra Arena, leading wire-to-wire. When I talked to Drew in recent weeks, he felt great about this team's ability to jell and truly embrace each other. They didn't feel like a group that had just met a few months ago.  \"You work as hard as you can in the portal and trying to put together a team in a short period of time,\" Drew said after the win. We're always prayerful. We get who God wants us to have. We've got a good group that we enjoy going to practice with. They enjoy being together, and life is short. You want to be around people you enjoy, and that's been a blessing.\" \nThat chemistry played out nicely: Baylor's starters all hit double figures with Tennessee transfer Cameron Carr leading the way with 21 points. Carr could emerge as one of the breakout players at this event by the end of it if he keeps this up and Baylor can go at least 2-1.  Baylor's 4-0 and will get No. 14 St. John's on Tuesday. The Bluejays are 3-2, with both their losses to power-conference teams (the other at No. 12 Gonzaga) and faces No. 15 Iowa State. Greg McDermott's team is trying to be NCAA Tournament caliber after losing one of the best players in school history, Ryan Kalkbrenner, in addition to the likes of Steven Ashworth and Jamiya Neal. Making matters more difficult for the Jays, 6-10 starter Jackson McAndrew is out for the year due to a broken foot suffered less than a week ago.  Big 12, Players Era agree to massive five-year deal The Big 12 is getting into the equity space. But by investment, not loan.  The conference, Players Era and EverWonder Studio jointly announced Monday a partnership that will guarantee eight of the league's 16 teams inclusion in the Players Era Championship over the next five years. \nThe 18-team event that is paying out millions to schools and players will increase to a 32-team field in 2026 and beyond, Players Era organizers told CBS Sports. The expansion plan and the economics of how Players Era is pulling off something unprecedented has prompted a lot of reaction around college basketball.   In exchange for at least 25% representation in Players Era, the Big 12 hopes to earn back big money on its commitment. \"Over the next six years, Players Era will commit no less than $50 million dollars to Big 12 basketball programs in rights fees,\" Players Era co-founder Seth Berger said. \nPlayers Era is ballooning to 32 teams beginning in 2026. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The league is represented in the 2025 field by Baylor, Houston, Iowa State and Kansas. The informal arrangement is to send the top eight teams in the Big 12 standings at the end of each season into the ensuing season's Players Era event, though that will not be a hard-and-fast rule. For example, Arizona will likely be a top-eight team in the Big 12 this season, but the Wildcats are scheduled to play in the 2026 Maui Invitational.   \"If a school has prior commitments, we're never going to hurt a school, but ultimately, in the long-term the vast majority of [the top eight] Big 12 schools will play every year,\" Players Era co-founder Ian Orefice told CBS Sports.   The Big 12 could potentially end up with more than eight of the 32 spots, as Kansas, Baylor, Houston and Iowa State all have deals with Players Era into the end of the decade, Berger told CBS Sports, with Kansas' being the longest at six years and Houston's being a \"lifetime\" agreement so long as Kelvin and/or Kellen Sampson are coaching the Cougars.   \"The Big 12 Conference is thrilled to grow its partnership with Players Era,\" Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark said. \"The tournament is a tremendous platform to showcase our conference, student-athletes and coaches as the best in college basketball, and we look forward to continuing to make Players Era a national marquee event.\"   \"You think about, if you're anchoring Players Era with the eight best Big 12 teams every year, it is already the best event in the country,\" Orefice said. \"With the commitments we've received now from the Big 12 and best teams in the country, we believe we are where we need to be to make sure Players Era is around for the long-term. We want all of the best teams, so we are actively talking to a few of the other select schools to figure out where we land in 2026 and beyond.\"    In addition to the 18 teams playing in this year's event, other teams that recently agreed to join Players Era include Louisville, Florida, Virginia, Miami and Texas A&M. Should all 18 schools playing in 2025 return for 2026, that means 24 of the 32 spots for next year are accounted for, per Berger, who's been involved in deep discussions with a few more schools trying to secure spots in the weeks to come.    Players Era has been under consistent scrutiny from competitors over its claims that it's a sustainable long-term model. The event will pay out more than $20 million to schools this year and has received major sponsorships from Geico, MGM Resorts, Publicis Groupe, Lilly, Sam's Club and more.   \"The 2025 men's tournament itself is profitable,\" Orefice said. \"We are incredibly proud to have made the financial commitment to schools.\"   Other high-major leagues were approached by Players Era about multi-year deals that would ensure representation in the event, per sources, but the Big 12 was the only conference willing to make the commitment. Monday's announcement is the next step in what organizers see as a huge evolution of what's now overtaken the Maui Invitational as the most prominent nonconference regular-season event in college hoops.   Berger and Orefice told CBS Sports they hope to secure a four-year media rights deal by the end of December. They have had discussions with \"four premium distributors.\" Players Era is currently a property under Warner Bros. Discovery, with the games airing on TNT and truTV.     \n        \n            \n                Big tournament, bigger money: How the Players Era event is changing college basketball in just its second year\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I think we're really close to getting this done. And when it's done, I think the number of teams that want to fill these last remaining spots is going to be many,\" Berger said. \"I feel like this is an opportunity to have a global impact for thousands of college basketball players.\"   2026 FORMAT: The 2026 Players Era will include four eight-team pools. The Big 12 will get at least two teams per pool, with the expectation that Big 12 schools will not play each other in the group stage. The tournament will play out over approximately three weeks in November 2026, with 16 teams one week, 16 more the next. From there, the four champions of each group will exclusively playing as the \"Four Kings\" of their respective pools in a final stage, with all four of those schools earning prize money that will total approximately $1 million. The winners of each group/pool will be determined by record, head-to-head, margin of victory (with a cap, as to not run up the score) and points per game allowed as tiebreakers.   \"There were many people who challenged the premise that early season college basketball can bring meaningful revenue for the event organizer and for the broadcast networks. Typically that's been left to broad season packages, conference championships and March Madness,\" Orefice said. \"If Players Era is even 10% of March Madness, it is a runaway financial success for the players, the schools and everyone involved.\"    2025 Players Era schedule, scores Games played in Las Vegas | All times ET Monday's gamesNo. 17 Tennessee 85, Rutgers 60RecapBaylor 81, Creighton 74 RecapKansas 71, Notre Dame 61RecapNo. 15 Iowa State 83, No. 14 St. John's 82RecapNo. 3 Houston 78, Syracuse 74 (OT)RecapNo. 21 Auburn 84, Oregon 73RecapNo. 12 Gonzaga vs. No. 8 Alabama9:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 7 Michigan vs. San Diego State10:30 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaUNLV vs. Maryland12 a.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden Arena Tuesday's games Rutgers vs. Notre Dame1 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 15 Iowa State vs. Creighton2 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaKansas vs. Syracuse3:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 14 St. John's vs. Baylor4:30 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaNo. 3 Houston vs. No. 17 Tennessee6 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 7 Michigan vs. No. 21 Auburn8:30 p.m. (TNT) at Michelob Ultra ArenaNo. 13 Gonzaga vs. Maryland9:30 p.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden ArenaOregon vs. San Diego State11 p.m. (TNT) at Michelob Ultra ArenaUNLV vs. No. 8 Alabama12 a.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden Arena Wednesday's games \t\t\t\tPremier Four\t\t\t\t Third-place game7 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaChampionship9:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaConsolation games TBD\t\t\t\t  Thursday's games Consolation games TBD   \n            ",

The Rams have looked dominant at times, but they lost at home to Mac Jones and the 49ers earlier this year.The Patriots have ripped off nine straight victories, but do you see that team being unbeatable?Putting together my weekly Power Rankings has been a major challenge this season since the top changes on a weekly basis.\nThe Rams stay in the top spot this week, but the Eagles and Colts — two of my top-five teams heading into last week — slip a bit after both lost road games on Sunday.It was 10 days ago we were talking about the Eagles and Colts possibly being the best in their respective conferences. Now there are questions for both.Then again, all the teams have questions. That's why we wonder if anybody is truly any good.Nobody looks dominant aside from maybe the Rams, and it was nine days ago when the Seahawks had a chance to beat them despite a four-interception performance by Sam Darnold.It really is still so wide open.\nAnd the NFL higher-ups wouldn't have it any other way.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                3\n            \n                Seahawks\n            \n                6\n            \n                Buccaneers\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Rams\n                                \n                            They are clearly the best team in the league right now.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels will return to practice this week but has not been cleared for contact and is considered unlikely to play in Week 13 against the Denver Broncos on \"Sunday Night Football,\" coach Dan Quinn announced Monday. Daniels suffered a dislocated elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks and has not played or practiced since. Daniels, 24, has battled a bevy of injuries this season. He also sprained his knee late in the Commanders' Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed two games due to a hamstring injury. In total, Daniels appeared in just six of Washington's 11 games this season and emerged healthy from just three of them. Overall, he has thrown for 1,184 yards, eight touchdowns and two interceptions and run for 262 yards and two touchdowns, though most of his numbers are down from his Offensive Rookie of the Year-winning 2024 campaign.Quinn said the team had not had internal discussions about shutting Daniels down for the year, even given the team's record. He also did not have an exact timetable for Daniels' return. The Commanders face the Vikings in Week 14 and the Giants in Week 15.\nQuinn said getting Daniels reps down the stretch was important as he's \"learning to play the position at the highest level,\" though he later said the team will be smart with his return.\"You just gotta try to do what's best,\" Quinn said. \"By no means are we careless about that. It's important, not just for Jayden, but for the entire team.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Jayden Daniels' elbow injury is latest cruel knife twist in Commanders' season gone awry\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMarcus Mariota has played in Daniels' stead. Injuries have been a major issue for Washington this season, with wide receiver Terry McLaurin (quad) having played in just four games and fellow starting wide receiver Noah Brown having played in just two games. Starting running back Austin Ekeler, top pass rusher Dorance Armstrong and a plethora of other players are out for the season, and Washington has lost six straight games to fall to 3-8 one year after going 12-5 and reaching its first NFC Championship game in over 30 years.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline isn't until Feb. 5, but with a month of the season in the books, team's are starting to assess what moves they want to make. There could be several big names on the trading block, but it's still too early for anything substantial to happen. But that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning before we've even reached Thanksgiving.But that's the nature of the NBA nowadays, things move fast and you have to get a jumpstart on the trade market if you want to make championship moves or changes that can position you better for the draft. With that in mind, here's the latest rumors circulating around the NBA.Clippers interested in DeMar DeRozanAn upcoming fire sale appears to be on the books for the Sacramento Kings, and teams are starting to set their sights on some players who could be available. DeMar DeRozan is drawing some interest from the Clippers, according to The Athletic's Sam Amick, in part because of his partially guaranteed contract for next season that could pay him only $10 million of a $27 million deal. The Clippers have struggled through the first month of the season with a 5-12 record, and have an offense that ranks 21st in the league.DeRozan's scoring would certainly help L.A., but at 36 years old it would only make the Clippers an even older roster that is already relying too much on veterans in a fast-paced NBA landscape. DeRozan has also never been a quality defender, and the Clippers' defense is undoubtedly a bigger issue that needs solving right now.Mavericks will have a difficult time trading Anthony DavisThe moment Nico Harrison was fired, Davis became a trade chip. The issue, though, is that he hasn't played since Oct. 29 as he's been dealing with a calf strain. And when Davis was healthy, he appeared out of shape and struggled defensively. So it's no surprise that those around the league think the Mavericks will have a hard time trying to trade Davis whose injury history is a red flag for opposing teams. ESPN's Tim Bontemps is reporting that Davis' injuries and his contract, which pays him $54.1 million, $58.4 million and $62.7 million over the next three seasons, are why there have not been very many suitors for the veteran forward. \nIf Davis, 32, manages to come back and show a sustained level of success without injury, then that could change. But this situation appears to be something that will drag out closer to the trade deadline.LaMelo Ball trade talk is premature, but doesn't mean it won't happenHeads started to turn when it was reported by Yahoo Sports' Kelly Iko that Ball was growing disgruntled with the direction of the Hornets and that he would be open to a trade. Ball shot down those rumors, but that doesn't mean a trade won't happen, either initiated by Charlotte or Ball. Jake Fischer is reporting that while talks of Ball getting traded are premature, it's something the Hornets could explore ahead of the deadline.Ball, 24, comes with his own red flags, primarily his continuous ankle injuries that have allowed him to play only 20 games more than Zion Williamson over his career. But amongst the big names mentioned, Ball certainly has the most trade value given his age, talent and a contract that isn't completely egregious.\nGrizzlies will explore Ja Morant trade marketMorant recently said he has lost his joy for playing basketball, he's been suspended a game for conduct detrimental to the team and the Grizzlies are 6-11. He's currently sidelined with a calf strain, but even when healthy, the 26-year-old is averaging near a career low across the board, and still hasn't been able to improve as a shooter. Combine that with the off-court issues he's had over the years and it creates a situation where he might be more trouble than he's worth for the Grizzlies. Bontemps reports that Memphis will explore the trade market, but it won't be an easy sell to find a package worth considering. That's not surprising given everything I just cited above, and who knows, maybe the Grizzlies turn things around and these trade rumors fizzle out. \n            ",

    "body": "\nIf Thursday's sports schedule is the main course of the Thanksgiving week sports-viewing feast, then Monday's is the pass-around appetizer. It's just satisfying enough to whet your appetite but not too much to ruin what's to come. Today's action centers around a Monday Night Football game with playoff implications: the San Francisco 49ers and Carolina Panthers battling at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The 49ers (7-4) sit in third place in the NFC West and are clinging onto the third and final wild card spot in the NFC. Meanwhile, the Panthers (6-5) have been one biggest surprises in the NFL this season and can overtake the struggling Buccaneers (6-5) for the lead in the NFC South with a victory on Monday.The matchup will pit San Francisco running back Christian McCaffrey against his former team for the first time. The all-around star played his first 5½ seasons in Carolina before he was traded to the 49ers midway through the 2022 season for a package of picks. This year, he leads the NFL in scrimmage yards (1,439) and is just the third player in NFL history with 700-plus rushing yards and 700-plus receiving yards through 11 games, joining Marshall Faulk (1998) and Roger Craig ('85).On Monday, McCaffrey will face a Panthers defense that ranks 18th in the league in yards per game allowed (325.9). San Francisco is a 7.5-point favorite against Carolina.While 49ers vs. Panthers is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes and a 10-game NBA slate and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Nov. 24. All times Eastern.NFL best bets, where to watchPanthers at 49ersTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Santa Clara, Calif . | TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: 49ers -7.5 | Expert: Panthers +7 (Larry Hartstein)\nAfter missing the previous six games with a turf toe injury, quarterback Brock Purdy returned for San Francisco last week and played well, completing 19-of-26 passes for 200 yards and three touchdowns and zero interceptions in a 41-22 victory against the Cardinals. On Monday, he will line up against a Carolina defense that ranks 16th in the NFL in pass defense (212.8 yards per game). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, says the 49ers have a 56% chance to cover and assigns a strong \"A\" grade to San Francisco -7.5. However, Panthers quarterback Bryce Young is coming off the best game of his career: 31-of-45 passing for a franchise-record 448 passing yards and three touchdowns against what was the No. 1 pass defense in the NFL (Atlanta). \"Over the past four games, San Francisco ranks 30th in success rate allowed,\" Hartstein says. \"Since Week 4, the 49ers are last with a 27% pressure rate.\"More NFL best betsBest sportsbook promos for 49ers-PanthersModel's anytime touchdown scorer props for Monday nightModel's Bryce Young and Brock Purdy player propsModel's Christian McCaffrey, Rico Dowdle player propsSportsLine AI's same-game parlay picksWill Brinson's top Monday Night Football playsNBA best bets, where to watchCavaliers at RaptorsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Toronto | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cavaliers -2.5\nTwo of the top teams in the Eastern Conference standings collide when the streaking Toronto Raptors host the Cleveland Cavaliers at Scotiabank Arena. After starting the season 1-4, the Raptors (12-5) have won 11 of their last 12 and sit in second place in the East, 2.5 games behind the red-hot Pistons. Toronto also has won its last five home games. Meanwhile, the Cavaliers (12-6) are in third place in the East. They will be playing the second game of a back-to-back after beating the Clippers in Cleveland 120-105 on Sunday. The Cavaliers rank sixth in the NBA in defensive efficiency (111.9 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says Cleveland has a 58% chance to cover and gives a \"C\" grade to Cavaliers -2.5.Rockets at SunsTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Phoenix | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Suns +6.5 | Expert: Alperen Sengun Over 16.5 total rebounds + assists -114 (Mike Barner)\nThis was supposed to be Kevin Durant's first game back in Phoenix after the organization traded him to the Houston Rockets in the offseason. But Durant will miss Monday's game (as well as Wednesday's at Golden State) due to a family matter. The 37-year-old Durant leads the team in scoring (24.6 points per game) while shooting 48.5% from the field, so multiple Houston players will have to take on a bigger offensive load on Monday. That's one of the reasons why Barner is backing Sengun. \"For the season, he is averaging 10.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists,\" Barner says. In addition the SportsLine Projection Model says the Suns, who have won eight of their last nine, have a 68.0% chance to cover and assigns a moderate \"B\" grade to Phoenix +6.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 13 Gonzaga vs. No. 11 AlabamaTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Las Vegas | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Alabama +4.5 | Expert: Alabama +4.5 (Thomas Casale)\nThe four-day Players Era tournament tips off on Monday with nine games. None arguably is bigger than the Alabama Crimson Tide (3-1) taking on the Gonzaga Bulldogs (5-0) in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The Crimson Tide already have played a murderous schedule this season, beating No. 5 St. John's, losing to No. 2 Purdue and knocking off No. 8 Illinois. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs have faced only one ranked team, No. 23 Creighton. Monday's game may come down to Alabama's backcourt against Gonzaga's frontcourt. The Tide are led by guards Labaron Philon Jr. (20.5 points per game) and Aden Holloway (17.7), while the Bulldogs rely on forwards Graham Ike (17.0) and Braden Huff (14.8). The SportsLine Projection Model says Alabama has a 51% chance to cover and gives a \"C\" grade to Crimson Tide +4.5. Meanwhile, Casale actually makes Alabama a small favorite. \"I'll take the 4.5 in a run-and-gun game that the Tide love to play,\" he says.\n            ",

The Blues slipped down to 12th in the group stage table after drawing 2-2 with Qarabag last time out. Manager Enzo Maresca rested several key players for that game, and Chelsea ultimately paid the price. He certainly won't make the same mistake against Barcelona. They're one of the best teams in Europe, so Maresca should field his strongest starting XI. It promises to be an entertaining game as both teams struggle defensively, but they're stacked with attacking talent.Neto and Fernandez keep Chelsea tickingChelsea moved up to second in the Premier League table after securing a routine 2-0 away win against Burnley at the weekend. The Blues are on a three-game winning streak in the league, and they're unbeaten in their last five matches. Star player Cole Palmer has  been out injured for most of the season and he'll miss this game after breaking his toe. Fortunately, his teammates have stepped up. Winger Pedro Neto and midfielder Enzo Fernández both scored in the win against Burnley. They're the club's joint top scorers this season with four goals apiece. João Pedro also has four goals, while Moisés Caicedo has found the back of the net three times. Defenders Trevoh Chalobah, Reece James, Malo Gusto, and Josh Acheampong have all chipped in with vital goals, along with forwards Estêvão and Alejandro Garnacho. Liam Delap has now recovered from an injury, and former Barcelona striker Marc Guiu offers another solid option in attack. Chelsea boast a great deal of firepower, so they should be able to exploit Barcelona's defensive weaknesses. Barça have conceded 15 goals in 13 La Liga games this season and they've also conceded seven times in four Champions League matches.However, Chelsea are also vulnerable in defense. Levi Colwill is injured, so Maresca normally pairs Chalobah with Toisin Adarabioyo at center back. They never look entirely convincing. The Blues have conceded four goals in six Champions League matches, and they concede about a goal per game in the Premier League on average. It's hard to see them keeping the likes of Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski at bay for 90 minutes, so this should be a high-scoring match.Barcelona might be Europe's most entertaining teamBarcelona also dropped points in their last Champions League game. They comprehensively outplayed Club Brugge in Belgium but defensive lapses cost them, and the game finished 3-3. They bounced back by beating Celta Vigo 4-2 in a league match, and they then thrashed Athletic Club 4-0 on Saturday. They've fired in 36 goals in 13 La Liga games this season, which is a remarkable record.However, the defense has been their Achilles' heel. They've only kept one clean sheet in their last 11 games, which is concerning. They play a high defensive line, and pacy wingers like Neto and Jamie Gittens could exploit it. Barcelona are arguably the most entertaining team in Europe. Their last six games have seen 30 goals - an average of five per game - and we've seen 4.8 goals per game in their last 20 Champions League matches. Key midfielder Pedri is likely to miss this game, so Marc Casado could partner Frenkie de Jong in the middle of the park. They'll have their work cut out against Caicedo and Fernández, two of the best midfielders in the world. The team that wins the midfield battle should go on and win this game. It could be tight as these teams look evenly matched. They're level on points in the Champions League group, they're both flying in their domestic leagues and both have extremely talented players in most positions.Ultimately, home field advantage could swing things in Chelsea's favor. The Blues have won both Champions League matches at Stamford Bridge this season. They'll face a much sterner test of their mettle against Barcelona but they could ultimately prevail if Caicedo and Fernández grab this game by the scruff of the neck.\n            ",

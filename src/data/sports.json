Drake Maye is second in the MVP odds (+145), while Jaxson Dart is second in the Offensive Rookie of the Year odds (+230), as both will be popular in NFL player props and with a Patriots vs. Giants SGP. New England is a 7.5-point favorite to utilize in NFL picks, but the over/under of 46.5 points may be of even more interest. That's because the Over is a combined 9-3 for the two teams over their last six games.Your 'MNF' SGP could include a combination of predictions related to the total or spread, as well as NFL props in regard to a player, team or the game in general. Dart has seven rushing touchdowns across his seven pro starts, so are his +340 prop odds as an anytime touchdown scorer worth gambling on with an NFL same-game parlay? Dart also has an over/under of 201.5 passing yards and 27.5 rushing yards.

In his last game, Henry had a career high of 115 receiving yards which came on seven receptions, one of which ended in a touchdown. The seven grabs were one shy of tying a career high, and over New England's last five games in which it was favored, as is the case on 'MNF', Henry's gone over his receptions bar in four of those contests.New York has a bottom-10 pass defense and has already seen a pair of tight ends go off with nine-reception games against it this season. Henry will also enjoy the comforts of Gillette Stadium as he has more catches, yards and touchdowns at home than on the road, despite playing the same number of games. Henry is projected to have 5.2 receptions on average, as this plus-money NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here, and bet this prop here:How to make Giants vs. Patriots SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has seven other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better, including one that returns plus money, that could be a part of your Patriots vs. Giants SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Giants vs. Patriots predictions?

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots (10-2) host the New York Giants (2-10) on Monday Night Football to wrap up the Week 13 NFL schedule between two franchises with plenty of history. The Patriots and Giants have played in some of the most memorable games in NFL history, but Tom Brady or Eli Manning won't be stepping on the field Monday. It's unfair to compare anyone to Brady, but the Patriots may have found their quarterback of the future in Drake Maye. Meanwhile, the Giants have struggled to find consistency at that position since Manning retired. These two franchises are trending in opposite directions, as the Patriots have won nine straight while the Giants have lost six straight. The Patriots are favored by 7.5 points, according to the latest Giants vs. Patriots odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 46.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Patriots vs. Giants.

New England has taken advantage of a softer schedule, going 7-1 against teams entering Week 13 with a losing record. And the Patriots find themselves against an inferior team again, with the Giants at 2-10 this season and on a six-game losing streak. New England has won nine straight games en route to a 10-2 start. Jaxson Dart (concussion) is back for the Giants, but he could show some rust as he's missed the last two weeks. Drake Maye is third in the NFL in passing yards (3,130) and near the top of the odds board for the NFL MVP race, and a big-time Monday Night Football performance can enhance his MVP chances. The model projects the Patriots to cover in 53% of simulations.Over 46.5 pointsAgain, not calling these two quarterbacks Tom Brady and Eli Manning yet, but both Maye and Dart have shown a high upside early in their NFL careers. Many were unsure if Dart would play his rookie season, but a strong preseason was the first sign he was ready for NFL competition. And once he took over for Russell Wilson, Dart proved worthy. The Giants are averaging 23.6 ppg in Dart's seven starts this season, compared to averaging 16.1 ppg last season. Meanwhile, the Patriots have the No. 7 scoring offense in the NFL at 26.5 ppg this season, including 28.7 ppg during their nine-game winning streak. New England has at least 24 points in seven straight games, and the Giants have the No. 30 scoring defense at 27.8 ppg allowed this season. The model projects 48 total points in this matchup.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        From one glance at the Championship Week college football odds, there is a clear outlier amongst the Power 4 title games. That's over in the Big 12, which has Texas Tech favored by 13.5 points over BYU, per the latest Championship Week college football lines. Meanwhile, the other power conference championship games all have college football spreads of under 6 points. They include Georgia vs. Alabama (+2.5) in the SEC, Ohio State vs. Indiana (+5.5) in the Big Ten and Virginia vs. Duke (+3.5) in the ACC.Whether you prefer to make Championship Week college football bets on smaller lines or larger college football spreads is a matter of preference. However, having the proper college football betting advice will set you up for success during the conference championship schedule.

No team has a better point differential than IU (+401), which is 50 points greater than what Ohio State has. Indiana also has the Heisman favorite in Fernando Mendoza, who leads FBS with 32 passing touchdowns, while topping the Big Ten in total touchdowns and yards per attempt. His counterpart, Julian Sayin, has thrown picks in his last two games away from home, and the Buckeyes haven't won the turnover battle in five straight games. In addition to the Hoosiers sticking within the spread, the model also says the Under hits nearly 70% of the time in an A-rated pick. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Duke (+3.5, 57.5) covers versus No. 16 Virginia in the ACC Championship Game on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET. The model projects the Blue Devils to cover almost 60% of the time. While UVA prevailed when these teams met on Nov. 8, the Cavs' offense is limping into this rematch. UVA averaged 36.4 points over its first nine games but is averaging over 13 fewer points over its last three. Meanwhile, Duke is coming off a season-high of 49 points in a victory over 8-win Wake Forest, as the Blue Devils have one of the most efficient offenses around. They rank 19th in the nation, and second in the ACC, with 34.6 ppg, and only two teams in all of FBS have thrown fewer interceptions. Virginia has as many turnovers (five) over its last three games as Duke has over its last nine games, and the turnover margin is one reason why Duke sticks within the spread. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Championship WeekThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every Championship Week matchup, and it's calling for three underdogs to outright win. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which three teams should you jump on?

Smith was put on leave effective Dec. 1.Smith was named the interim coach last year when Tim Albin left to take the Charlotte job. Albin led Ohio to its first Mid-American Conference title since 1968 but departed prior to the Cure Bowl. Smith then was promoted to full-time head coach. Before arriving at Ohio in 2022, Smith was the offensive coordinator at Hawaii, his alma mater, and Washington State. \nHauser has spent most of his career coaching in the MAC, with time at Northern Illinois and Miami (OH) before joining the Bobcats' staff in 2022. He's risen from safeties coach to defensive coordinator and associate head coach, and will now get a crack at the interim head coaching position. The Bobcats went 6-2 in conference play this season, but missed out on a second straight trip to the MAC title game due to tiebreakers with Miami (OH). Miami will face Western Michigan for the conference crown on Saturday. CBS Sports' bowl projections have Ohio in the GameAbove Sports Bowl against Penn State on Dec. 26. \nThe Bobcats will officially find out their bowl destination on Selection Sunday on Dec. 7. \n            \n    ",

The video includes audio of someone telling Patullo to \"Get the f--- out of Philly.\" The Moorestown Police Department has stated that the investigation is ongoing. Patullo's home was vandalized following another tough outing for the Eagles' offense. Against the Bears, Philadelphia's offense managed to score just 15 points while committing two turnovers. The Eagles' running game was once again a non-factor as Saquon Barkley carried the ball just 13 times for 56 yards. Through 12 games, the Eagles' offense is currently 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing, 22nd in rushing and 28th in third down efficiency. Philadelphia is getting it done in the red zone, however, as it is currently tops in the NFL with a 75.9% touchdown rate inside the opponents' 20-yard-line. \nWhile he said that he will evaluate everything following the loss to Chicago, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni stated that Patullo will continue to serve as his offensive play-caller. Patullo, 44, has been on Sirianni's staff since he took over as the Eagles' coach back in 2021. \"I have confidence in the entire group,\" Sirianni said. \"I know it will keep coming back to Kevin. If I thought it was one thing, I'd make those changes. Obviously, it's a lot of different things. I don't think it's Kevin.\"\nDespite their offensive struggles, the Eagles will head into their Week 14 with the Chargers with an 8-4 record and in first place in the NFC East. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin had plenty of people to give him guidance while he was trying to decide between staying at Ole Miss and leaving for LSU. In an interview before he hopped on the plane to Baton Rouge, Kiffin credited mentor Pete Carroll, whom he coached under at USC, with encouraging him to leave for the Tigers. But during his introductory press conference at LSU on Monday, Kiffin revealed that none other than Nick Saban also had a huge hand in the process. \"Coach Saban kind of coached at another place in this conference so I can't really say exactly what he said,\" Kiffin said. \"I will say, I think the world of coach Saban and I respect him. So there's a reason I'm here.\" \n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSaban won a national title at LSU before a brief foray in the NFL gave way to his legendary career at Alabama, where he spent 17 seasons from 2007-23. Kiffin was his offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2014-16. The two won three consecutive SEC titles and one national title together. \nThough he had the support he needed to make the move to LSU, Kiffin noted that it wasn't an easy process. He had several meetings with Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter and the university's administration in the hours before he made his final decision. Kiffin doubled down on the claim that, in spite of the fact that he had player support after a team meeting Sunday morning, Ole Miss determined that he would not coach in the Rebels' expected College Football Playoff appearance. According to Kiffin, the timing of Ole Miss' decision also prevented him from telling the team that he was leaving. None of that deterred Kiffin, who made his final announcement via social media Sunday. \n\"I hate that I didn't get to explain to the players why,\" Kiffin said. \"But I also totally respect and understand the decision they felt they had to make for the program.\" He left for Baton Rouge the same day. Kiffin, who agreed to a seven-year, $91 million contract, had to contact a police officer that he knew to guide him and his son to the airport, where Ole Miss fans met him with boos and middle fingers. \"That airport scene, and all the things being said, I understand it's the passion,\" Kiffin said. \"But they're saying that about you and you thought you did a really good job for six years for them. That affects you.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's Toyotathon time again, which means it's once again an opportunity for Jordan Love to put up big numbers while leading the Packers to wins. During the previous two Toyotathons -- which annually run from mid-November to early January -- the Packers went a combined 11-5 with Love throwing 28 touchdowns, two interceptions and completing 68.3% of his passes. In non-Toyotathon games, Green Bay was 7-9 with Love throwing 29 touchdowns, 20 interceptions and completing just 59.0% of his throws. The Packers' quarterback has embraced his success during Toyotathon, which has carried over into this season. This year, Love and Toyotathon teamed up to create 250 Panini cards that include Love's numbers during the previous two Toyotathons. Each card also includes a piece of Love's Toyotathon sweater. \nAs alluded to earlier, Love's success during Toyotathon (which began Nov. 19) has continued this year. During his first two games of Toyotathon, Love has thrown four touchdowns and no interceptions while leading the Packers to wins over the Commanders and Lions. \nAgainst Detroit, Love was awarded the John Madden Thanksgiving MVP trophy after throwing for 234 yards and four touchdowns during Green Bay's 31-24 win. \nToyotathon vs. non-Toyotathon performance (2023–25) CategoryToyotathonNon-ToyotathonRecord13–513–12–1TD Passes3244Interceptions223Completion %67.8%62.7%Packers fans are obviously hoping that Love's success during Toyotathon continues for the remainder of the 2025 regular season, starting with Sunday's crucial matchup between the NFC North-leading Bears. The Packers will play Chicago twice in a three-week span with a home game against the 10-2 Broncos sandwiched in between. While fans are hoping the Packers' regular season will end with some readily available playoff merch, getting hold of one of Love's exclusive Toyotathon cards may be harder to come by. But if you are determined to get one, the majority of them are currently in the trusted hands of Wisconsin Toyota dealers. \n\"Our dealers are the longtime guardians of Toyotathon magic. They know how to recognize the chosen few. The cards will find their way -- by destiny, not application,\" according to a news release for the promotion. \"Maybe it's for buying a vehicle or wearing a Jordan Love jersey while taking a test drive, but our dealers will find a way to identify those who are destined to carry the magic with them.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Florida athletic director Scott Sricklin introduced Jon Sumrall as the school's next football coach on Monday. And after that introduction was made, Stricklin spent a bulk of time answering questions about the candidate who did not accept the job. We, of course, would be talking about Lane Kiffin.The Gators' interest in Kiffin was no secret, but the two sides never came to an agreement, and Kiffin was introduced as the new LSU coach shortly after Sumrall took the podium in Gainesville. Stricklin admitted he didn't know why Kiffin turned down the Florida job but felt like they had some \"productive conversations\" throughout the process.\"He's a fascinating guy, and I respect his decision,\" Stricklin said, per The Independent Florida Alligator. \"I don't know why he made the decision he did, but, I would say we had productive conversations.\"Stricklin denied the rumors that he and Kiffin didn't mesh well in interviews, saying that there is a lot of \"false information\" going around about the coaching search.\"There's a lot of twisted information, and a lot of people trying to create narratives that benefit themselves,\" Stricklin said. \"And so look, I said earlier, I'm not gonna talk about any other candidates, but Lane was a pretty visible candidate.\"\nCBS Sports' own John Talty chronicled the chaos that was the Kiffin courtship by Florida, LSU and Ole Miss. In that article, Talty reports that initial talks between Kiffin and Stricklin weren't exactly smooth. Part of the disconnect was Florida's insistence on having a general manager who would report directly to the next coach.\n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUltimately, Kiffin passed on the opportunity to coach the Gators and wound up in Baton Rouge. Stricklin was pleased that Florida ended up where it did -- with Sumrall in charge after another great season at the Group of Five level. Stricklin also said he holds no ill will toward other parties involved in the process.\"I'm really happy with where we are,\" Stricklin said. \"I wish him the best. I wish all the schools involved the best, except for when we play them.\"\nWhen it became clearer that Kiffin was leaning away from Florida, Stricklin said he knew the Gators had to act fast because there would be \"a line out the door\" for Sumrall, who came recommended by Urban Meyer. Auburn was reportedly interested in Sumrall, but Florida was able to lure him away from Tulane after pivoting away from Kiffin.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We have a jam-packed schedule for week 7, with the majority of teams playing four games. A loaded slate typically means deciding on who to start and who to sit can be difficult, given the number of choices available. Despite the return of Kevin Durant, Reed Sheppard remained in the starting lineup for Sunday's win over the Jazz. Is this going to be a trend moving forward or simply an anomaly?Week 7 brings with it plenty of NBA action, with 22 teams suiting up four times and just six teams taking the court three times. That leaves the Suns and the Kings as the only two teams with two games.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players during the home stretch.Four Games: ATL, BKN, BOS, CHA, CHI, CLE, DAL, DEN, DET, GSW, HOU, LAC, LAL, MIA, MIL, NYK, ORL, PHI, POR, TOR, UTA, WAS\nThree Games: IND, MEM, MIN, NOP, OKC, SASTwo Games: PHO, SACHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the seventh week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.GuardsConsider starting: Reed Sheppard, HOUOpponents: @UTA, SAC, PHO, @DALDespite the return of Kevin Durant, Sheppard remained in the starting lineup during Sunday's win over the Jazz. His role had been a point of contention prior to Durant's absence, with Sheppard continuously coming off the bench. In his three starts, Sheppard has averaged 15.7 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 2.0 three-pointers and 4.0 combined steals and blocks. It remains to be seen whether Sheppard will continue to start, although Sunday was an encouraging development. With four games on the slate, it's time to activate Sheppard across all formats.Consider sitting: Zach LaVine, SACOpponents: @HOU, @MIAThe Kings continue to be one of the more disappointing teams in the league. The roster construction raised a lot of questions coming into the season, questions that remain relevant six weeks into the season. LaVine has been solid enough on the offensive end, providing Sacramento with a consistent scoring threat. In seven games over the past two weeks, LaVine has averaged 17.4 points, 1.1 steals and 1.9 three-pointers. However, his supporting stats are less than ideal, averaging 2.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 0.0 blocks during that time. With only two games coming up, LaVine is someone to seriously consider moving to the bench, especially if your squad is ripe with scoring threats.\nConsider sitting: Grayson Allen, PHOOpponents: @LAL, @HOUAllen has been fantastic thus far, averaging 17.9 points, 4.2 assists, 1.6 steals and 3.8 three-pointers per game through his first 14 appearances. However, having recently returned from an injury-related absence, Allen could remain on some sort of minute restriction for at least the next week. He scored 10 points in his first game back, logging 25 minutes. Given there are so many teams suiting up four times, it makes sense to have Allen on your bench, factoring in all the variables that could still be present regarding his short-term role.ForwardsConsider starting: Noah Clowney, BKNOpponents: CHA, @CHI, UTA, NOPAfter showing promise for the past two years, it appears as though Clowney has finally carved out a consistent role in the Brooklyn rotation. Prior to Saturday's blowout loss to the Bucks, Clowney had played at least 35 minutes in four straight games. In six appearances over the past two weeks, he has averaged 17.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 3.0 three-pointers and 2.1 combined steals and blocks. He has scored double digits in 11 of his past 13 games, while his defensive numbers have started to trend in the right direction. The Nets have four games this week, three of which are against favorable opponents. It's simple. Get him active.Consider starting: Peyton Watson, DENOpponents: DAL, @IND, @ATL, @CHAWatson has taken full advantage of the fact that Denver is dealing with a couple of significant injuries, those being to Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun. He has moved into the starting lineup, subsequently putting up career-best numbers. He has been a top 50 player over the past two weeks, averaging 16.3 points, 6.9 rebounds, 2.3 three-pointers and 1.6 combined steals and blocks in seven appearances. Both Gordon and Braun are likely to miss at least another month, likely making Watson a key piece of the rotation moving forward. Denver is another team with four games, three of which are team-friendly. Get Watson into your starting lineups.\nConsider sitting: DeMar DeRozan, SACOpponents: @HOU, @MIAMuch like LaVine, DeRozan has been a little up and down thus far, not surprising given the state of things in Sacramento. While he has stepped things up over the past two weeks, his numbers are still somewhat underwhelming. During that span, he has averaged 17.6 points, 3.7 assists and 1.6 steals in 31.4 minutes per contest. Understandably, his motivation is lacking at times, meaning another poor performance could be just around the corner. In a case of quantity over quality, DeRozan moving to the bench for a quiet week could be the smart move.CentersConsider starting: Moussa Diabate, CHAOpponents: @BKN, @NYK, @TOR, DENDiabate continues to come off the bench behind Ryan Kalkbrenner and yet has been able to remain relevant in standard leagues. Through 20 appearances, Diabate is averaging 9.3 points, 8.1 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in just 22.9 minutes per game. His playing time is tough to project, with head coach Charles Lee opting to make rotation-based decisions on the fly, based on the individual matchup. However, starting a player who could hypothetically get you 40 rebounds and 10 defensive stats could be worth the risk.Consider sitting: Derik Queen, NOPOpponents: MIN, MIN, @BKNQueen remains in the starting lineup despite his recent play, turning out a combined -63 in his past three games. He has been outside the top 180 in the past week, averaging 8.8 points, 4.3 rebounds and 4.0 assists in just 21.0 minutes per game. It's hard to get a good read on what is going on in New Orleans, meaning Queen's potential value is really up in the air. He is worth holding, given what we saw from him earlier in the season. However, moving him to the bench until things settle down seems like a viable option.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots will host the New York Giants for Monday Night Football in Week 13 with kickoff scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET. The Giants are hopeful that Jaxson Dart will be cementing himself as a franchise quarterback this time next year, just as Drake Maye has done for the Patriots. Maye is an MVP candidate and tight end Hunter Henry has become one of the second-year quarterback's favorite targets. Henry is tied for the team lead with five touchdowns on the season and is coming off a 100-yard game last week, but he's still priced as high +210 in the Patriots vs. Giants anytime touchdown scorer odds. That's why he's one of the SportsLine Projection Model's top MNF anytime TD scorer picks. Targeting NFL player props is one way to approach NFL odds at online sports betting sites for Monday Night Football in Week 13.

New England has had more wide receiver involvement with Stefon Diggs joining the roster this offseason, but Henry still ranks second on the team in targets (61) and receiving yards (537). He's also tied for first with five touchdowns and he's coming off his biggest game of the season last week in Cincinnati, with seven catches for 117 yards and a TD. The model predicts that he scores 0.46 touchdowns on average while the implied scoring probability is 32.3%. Use the latest bet365 bonus code to find this price and get $150 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (+220, bet365)Stevenson has been surpassed by rookie TreVeyon Henderson as New England's top back, but he's still the more bruising back and Henderson has had mixed results as a short-yardage runner despite being the more explosive back. Against New York's putrid run defense, there might be plenty of opportunities for both. The Giants rank last in the NFL in rushing yards allowed and yards allowed per carry (5.9). The model predicts 0.46 touchdowns on average for Stevenson while the odds imply a 31.3% chance to score. Get $150 in bonus bets after your first $5 wager win or lose.Theo Johnson, Giants (+280, FanDuel)The second-year tight end out of Penn State has been by far the team's most reliable red-zone threat since Malik Nabers went down with a season-ending knee injury. He leads the team with five receiving touchdowns and four of those scores have come from inside the 20-yard line.

    "body": "\n        Welcome back to the NBA Hater Report: A breakdown of some of the players, teams and trends around the league that are drawing the ire of yours truly. If you're not a fellow pessimist, proceed with caution. LaMelo Ball's one-legged bricksOne-legged 3-pointers have become a thing in the NBA. I remember when Stephen Curry pulled one out against the Spurs in the second round of the 2013 playoffs when he was on a postseason heater and he could've shot left handed and justified it. He made that shot, by the way. Everyone laughed. It was just part of the Curry experience. It wasn't something anyone thought they would ever seen on any sort of a regular basis. And as a rule, that's held true. Victor Wembanyama has tossed up a few. Trae Young and LeBron James will do it from time time to time. But the exception to this rule is LaMelo Ball, who basically now takes all of his step-back 3s off one foot. Seriously. Pretty much all of them (and a handful of others off any kind of dribble) look like some version of this:And this ...And this ...And this ...And this ...For the most part Ball still takes his catch-and-shoots off two feet, but he's not immune to firing up one-leggers in this context, either.\nNow listen, I'm not going to be the get-off-my-lawn traditionalist that says you have to do everything by the instructional manual. In fact, I'm the opposite of that. Doing anything because \"that's the way it has always been done\" is a fool's logic. That's true in all of life, and it's certainly true in sports, where you have to ask hard questions about the way things have always been done and challenge tradition and ultimately to the things that work best for you in your context. Nobody played like Stephen Curry until Stephen Curry. Half the shots he takes would be considered awful shots by traditional standards. I don't care about tradition. What every basketball player should care about are results, and in Ball's case, they're not good. So far the Hornets star is making just 28% of his 3s, and specifically he's 7 for 27 (25.9%) on step-backs according to NBA.com tracking and 27.5% on all of-the-dribble 3s. He really started doing this last year. The \"pull-up jump shot\" tracking classification encapsulates most of the non-step-back off-the-dribble 3s and Ball was 28% on those last year. He typically does it when he is already moving in a direction that it makes the release more rhythmic or when he needs to create space to get off a cleaner shot, but for a guy who already struggles to shoot consistently to have inconsistent form seems, shall we say, less than ideal. \nNever mind the optics of it. Here you have this free-wheeling player who already has circus-act aspects of his game, and he's launching up H-O-R-S-E shots as a matter of routine and barely making any of them, relatively speaking. None of this is meant to suggest Ball isn't a good player. He's outrageously talented. The Hornets are actually a plus team when he's on the floor this season and have gotten worse when he leaves the floor in each of the last five seasons. Some of that is because the Hornets haven't had very many good players in Ball's time there, but he's probably not the losing player he's made out to be if he ever ends up in a winning situation. Although that remains to be seen.What we do know about Ball to this point in his career is he hasn't been even a league-average 3-point shooter since his third year in the league and he's gotten significantly worse in each of the last three seasons, bottoming out so far this year. And now he's jacking up one-leggers like he's in the driveway. \nWarriors turning their season overThere was a time when the Warriors could throw the ball all over the arena and it didn't matter because they had enough firepower to overcome their many and oftentimes ridiculously careless mistakes. That is not the case anymore. These Warriors are small and athletically inferior to most opponents. When Stephen Curry is off the floor they basically have no offense. Even when he's on the floor they're not that great. To win, these Warriors have to actually take care of the margins. Specifically, they have to take care of the ball. Instead, they're fumbling it around like it's lathered in grease, turning it over two more times per game than last season and on 16.2% of their total possessions -- the fourth-worst mark in the league per Cleaning the Glass. It is absolutely the difference between them winning and losing games, and Steve Kerr knows it. \n\"I have zero doubt that the number one thing keeping up from winning consistently is out turnovers,\" Kerr recently said. \"Zero doubt. The numbers show it. The tape shows it. ... If there is one thing that ie keeping us from winning more games, it's the turnovers. Make no mistake.\"\nKerr is right. The Warriors are 10-1 this season when they win or tie the turnover battle, and they are 1-9 when they lose it. In other words, there is, at least so far, almost a 100% guarantee that they will win the game if they manage to commit fewer turnovers than their opponent, and they just can't bring themselves to do it more than half the time. That's going to make you a .500 team. Understand, the Warriors play a style that invites turnovers. They anticipate openings and push pace and throw needle-threading passes, all of which comes at a heightened level of risk. When it works, the rewards look beautiful. Back-door layups. Slips to the basket. Transition and early offense buckets. But when it goes bad, it goes really bad. So far this year it's been too much bad, and it's costing the Warriors big time. \nEvery Clippers loss is OKC's gainThe Clippers have gone from one of the offseason's supposed biggest winners to one of the biggest losers in the league. They're 5-15. They've lost 15 of their last 17, with their only two wins in that stretch coming against the Hornets and Mavericks, two of the only teams actually worse than the Clippers. There's been a lot of talk about injuries. Sure. Bradley Beal is out for the season and Kawhi Leonard is, well, playing about as often as he usually plays. Derrick Jones Jr. has missed some time, too. Fine. That is the sort of absence every team in the league deals with. But even when Leonard has played the Clippers have stunk. They're 3-7 in the 10 games he's played and minus-8.6 points per 100 possessions when he's on the floor. James Harden is having a terrific season and it doesn't mean a thing. He's getting frustrated, too. How long until this guy demands a trade? \nNone of this would matter beyond the Clippers being a very expensive mess if they didn't owe the defending champion Thunder their 2026 first-round pick. But they do. And it's unprotected. In a class that is so talented that Yahoo's Kevin O'Connor recently cited some league executives that believe Cooper Flagg wouldn't go any higher than third had he not reclassified and was still set to become draft eligible next summer. Now the Thunder are going to get that pick? Think about the ramifications of that on a league-wide scale. This is an almost unfairly deep and talented team. And just when it's about to start getting too expensive to keep together, along comes a lower-paid standout like Ajay Mitchell and Aaron Wiggins on a clearance-rack contract ... and now this almost-certain lottery pick coming from the Clippers next season. As it looks right now, the Clippers could have a legit shot at a top-three pick. If the Thunder go back-to-back, which at this point they look poised to do, and also have a top-three pick in this 2026 class, the Clippers will have screwed every team in the league beyond their own disastrous season. \nLet's not even get into the fact that OKC also own Utah's 2026 pick if it ends up outside the top eight. Joel Embiid's contract is a disasterThe 76ers didn't have to sign Joel Embiid to a three-year, $193 million extension last September. He still had two years on left on his what is his current deal, including a player option in 2026-27. They could've, and clearly should've, waited to see how his health was going to play out for as long as they could. They might've been out of the Embiid business as soon as this summer if he didn't want to pick up that player option. But now they could be paying him $67.4 million three years from now.I've seen some Sixers fans suggesting Embiid deserves this money even if he can't play anymore, literally, given all he's done for the franchise. Excuse me? He's never been healthy enough to take the Sixers past the second round. We're not talking about Kobe's last thank-you deal with the Lakers here. Embiid was a great player in his prime, obviously, but not even close, ultimately, to meaningful enough to \"deserve\" this kind of equity cash out. \nThe only way Embiid is worth this money is if he's at least somewhat valuable enough on the court to justify it, and that just isn't the case and there's no reason to believe it ever will be again. Embiid's played in seven games this season. Seven. The latest being Philly's loss to Atlanta on Sunday in which Embiid was a minus-11 for the game. Even if he still serves a diminished offensive purpose as a two-man partner with Maxey, midrange scorer and post presence to attract occasional double teams (to whatever degree the Sixers want to grind their possessions down by playing through him), he cannot be any sort of focal point and cannot jump over a phonebook to rebound, and he cannot, and does not, move at all defensively. When Embiid has been on the floor, the Sixers have posted what would ranked as the second-worst defensive rating in the league, per Cleaning the Glass. \nNow add to this Paul George's disastrous deal, which is set to pay him $54.1 million next season and potentially $56.6 million the year after that, and yeah, the Sixers' books are absolutely cooked for the foreseeable future for two guys who have played a total of 12 games this season and just one actually together. The George deal, at least, made sense to most people at the time. The Embiid extension didn't have to happen when it did. The Sixers could have collected more information. They are going to regret not doing that for quite some time. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Who are the Chicago Bulls? It's one of the more persistent questions of the early 2025-26 season. Their 6-1 start -- which came on the heels of a successful end to last season -- suggested that this was a team on the rise. They've lost nine of their 12 games since. That, in itself, doesn't necessarily need to be damning. Growth isn't linear, and developing identities is usually a bumpy process. The 2022 Celtics were below .500 in mid-January before reaching the Finals. Last year's Pacers were 16-18 on New Year's Day.That Pacers comparison is appropriate. Chicago has emulated components of what made Indiana so successful in recent years, most notably its speed. That hasn't been an accident. In a deeply reported Bulls feature for ESPN, multiple sources cited the Pacers as a source of roster-building inspiration for Chicago. \"That's who we have to be,\" head coach Billy Donovan said. \"We have to be better than the sum of our parts. ... Everybody sees Indiana play, and the thing that everybody goes to right away is oh, their pace, their pace, their pace.\"Another Bulls source cited the Pacers as an example of what might come next for Chicago. \"They have Haliburton, who is an All-Star, and they have Siakam,\" the source said. \"If Giddey can develop into an All-Star and be what Hali was, when do we pull the trigger to get our Siakam?\"\n        \n            \n                NBA quarter-season grades for every East team: Knicks, Cavs can improve, Pistons get 'A+' and one team fails\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe concept of following another team's blueprint gets bandied about in roster-building discussions somewhat frequently, but it's worth asking how often that approach really works. Look at the best teams in the NBA today. Did Oklahoma City copy anyone? They tanked aggressively for two years, but nobody has a patent on losing. They are stylistically defined by one MVP-level scorer and wave after wave of All-Defense-caliber role players. There's not exactly a model for what they've built.\nDenver? Of course the Nuggets didn't copy anyone. They have Nikola Jokić, who is one of a kind. Their roster build has more or less boiled down to finding players that make sense next to him, specifically: defensive-minded, athletic forwards that can cut (Aaron Gordon, Peyton Watson, Bruce Brown on the smaller side), shooting wings (Michael Porter Jr., Cam Johnson, Tim Hardaway Jr.), a backup center who can serve as an offensive hub in the best of times (DeMarcus Cousins, Jonas Valančiūnas) and of course, a high-level guard creator who developed a unique chemistry with their big man (Jamal Murray).Houston? They certainly modeled their asset accumulation after Oklahoma City, but their playing style is distinct. Think of their historic offensive rebounding. That was seemingly a market inefficiency they identified early. They led the league in offensive rebounding rate by a mile during the 2022-23 season. At that point, league-wide offensive rebounding was at an all-time low. The 2022-23 season saw the eighth-lowest league-wide offensive rebounding rate in history, but the seven seasons with lower ones were the seven preceding seasons. Houston jumpstarted the league's shift toward offensive rebounding last season, when they won playing Alperen Sengun and Steven Adams together primarily to maximize their offensive rebounding.The best teams by and large tend to be trendsetters, not followers. This season has had the highest league-wide offensive rebounding rate since the 2012-13 campaign. The Rockets are primarily responsible for that. League-wide 3-point attempts are down year over year, and so are ball screens. Denver isn't the only team responsible for that shift, but it's hard not to view the Nuggets as a model of how a team can win with ball-movement and limited 3-point shooting. The Thunder have led the league in drives in four of the past five seasons. Last year, only the Grizzlies and Thunder averaged at least 54 drives per game. This year, seven teams have crossed that threshold.\nCommon teams look at the best organizations in the league and try to emulate them. They usually just build pale imitations of the true contenders they're copying. We see versions of this story play out almost every year. Remember when the Lakers won the title in 2020? Everyone assumed that the only way to keep up with them would be to stockpile big men to throw at Anthony Davis and their enormous front line. Several contenders threw ill-fated contracts at centers specifically to combat the Lakers. Utah gave Derrick Favors a three-year mid-level deal that's still the Jazz today, as they had to give the Thunder a valuable first-round pick just to dump the contract a year later. The Clippers swung and missed on Serge Ibaka, and Boston did the same with Tristan Thompson. Mason Plumlee was a backup who hardly played in the Western Conference finals against the Lakers. He still managed to parlay his size into a big three-year deal with the Pistons. The entire league shifted off of one championship run.And it didn't exactly pay off. The Bucks played big lineups when they won the 2021 championship, but Giannis Antetokounmpo is inimitable. The Western Conference champion Suns were a one-big team. And then the Warriors reclaimed the title a year later with Draymond Green starting at center in the last three games of the Finals, much as he did in 2015, when the Golden State dynasty began. Time, in the NBA, is a flat circle.This is the danger in chasing trends. They change so quickly that by the time you've successfully copied whoever you're trying to copy, the league has adjusted to whatever made that original team so successful. That doesn't put an expiration date on stylistically distinct teams. The best ones are capable of some measure of adaptation, but are also so good at what makes them special that they can overcome league-wide adjustment in ways that copycats often can't.\nSo let's compare the Pacers and the Bulls. Josh Giddey does share stylistic similarities with Tyrese Haliburton. They're both transition maestros, after all, and Giddey has improved markedly as a 3-point shooter lately, which is a Haliburton staple. But Giddey only really makes 3s off the catch. Haliburton made 39 pull-up 3s in last year's playoffs alone. Giddey has made 35 in total over the last four seasons. Giddey has never shot better than 53% on 2s, and he's at just 50.9% as a Bull in a higher-usage role. In Haliburton's three full seasons as a Pacer, he's made 58% of his 2s. Giddey can do some of the things that Haliburton does, but that doesn't mean he can be for Chicago what Haliburton has been for Indiana.The notion of finding their own Siakam is similarly fraught. All-Star forwards very rarely become available. When they do, they typically either come with enormous prices (we live in a world in which Mikal Bridges went for five first-round picks) or they have a specific destination in mind that is usually closer to contention than the Bulls are now. The Bulls could aim for a star trade, but there's no guarantee they could make one without gutting their team. Even trading for Anthony Davis, as ESPN reported they've considered, comes with taking on a max salary. The Siakam trade, for Indiana, was in many ways a case of \"right place, right time.\" A player who made sense for them was available at a price that made sense for them. Siakam's age, his shooting, and his impending free agency made him gettable for the Pacers without sacrificing anything from their core. They pounced, and the rest is history. If anything, Chicago's best chance at a Siakam-esque forward is probably internal with Matas Buzelis, but he has a long way to go before that becomes a possibility.The Pacers have had a ton of success with so-called \"second draft\" players, highly drafted youngsters who didn't quite pan out with their original teams. Think Aaron Nesmith and Obi Toppin. This is another tactic the Bulls have tried to copy. They by and large seem happy with Giddey thus far, though again, they may be setting expectations a bit too high for him. Isaac Okoro is still more or less the same player he was in Cleveland: a decent defender who can make wide-open looks, but still shoots at modest volume and likely won't be guarded in high-leverage moments.\nIf you squint at Chicago's roster, almost everyone seems like a slightly worse version of an Indiana equivalent. The Pacers hit a home run with Andrew Nembhard at top of the second round. The Bulls hit a solid double with Ayo Dosunmu in the same range of the drafts. The Pacers had shooting center in Myles Turner. The Bulls do too in Nikola Vučević, but he doesn't defend nearly as well as Turner. That has made it far harder for the Bulls to copy the Pacers defensively. In 2024, the Pacers, sensing their defensive vulnerability, decided to essentially punt on rim-protection in favor of 3-point defense. They were the only team to allow fewer than 30 3-point attempts per game, but in exchange, they allowed the most paint points per game in the league. The Bulls allow the second-most paint points per game this season behind only the tanking Wizards, but their opponents take the seventh-fewest 3s per possession in the league.This is the real pitfall of trying to copy another team's roster-build. What are the odds that you're going to build a better version of the Pacers than the Pacers did? Especially since the Pacers still exist, and Chicago will have to compete against them moving forward. The irony of all of this is that it seems as though the Bulls are trying harder to be the Pacers than the Pacers did.The Siakam trade was opportunistic. So, frankly, was the Haliburton acquisition. Rick Carlisle was never locked into the idea of playing fast. In fact, his last six Mavericks teams were below league-average in terms of pace. Because that's what his rosters dictated. The Pacers formed their style around their players. They drafted well and traded aggressively for who was available, not a predetermined set of players that they wanted. What they built was organic to the players they had. They made the most of who they could acquire.\nThe danger of locking into someone else's course is that you're not going to be presented with all of the same roster-building opportunities that they were. A Siakam-esque addition might never be available to the Bulls. Giddey probably won't ever be Haliburton. The Bulls don't have a top-five pick in a loaded draft coming as the Pacers do. But the Bulls may at some point in the next few years have access to roster-building opportunities that the Pacers didn't, things that might force them to adjust the way that they're playing or the sort of players they intend to target.When that happens, they're going to have to keep an open mind, because there's just no way to out-Pacers the Pacers, or out-Thunder the Thunder, or out-Nuggets the Nuggets. What the Bulls can do is become the best possible version of the Bulls. That's how you build a contender in the NBA. You can only get so far playing the copycat game.\n            ",

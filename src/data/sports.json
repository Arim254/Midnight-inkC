    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        From fifth-round pick to Pro Bowler. Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders has been added to the Pro Bowl as a replacement, as first reported by Jordan Schultz. Sanders is the first fifth-round rookie to make the Pro Bowl since Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua. The original AFC quarterbacks selected to the Pro Bowl were Josh Allen, Justin Herbert and Drake Maye. With Maye off to the Super Bowl, there is at least one spot open for a new quarterback in the NFL's all-star games. Sanders went 3-4 as the starter this season, and completed 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions in eight total games played. After being made the inactive emergency third quarterback for the first half of the season, Sanders got his first career start in Week 12 against the Las Vegas Raiders. Sanders led the Browns to a 24-10 victory, and completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He became the first Browns quarterback to win his first career start since 1995.While Sanders won his first NFL start, he registered the second-worst completion percentage since Week 11, which was his NFL debut, and threw an NFL-high 10 interceptions in the last eight weeks of the season as well. Sanders was pressured on an NFL-high 51% of his dropbacks, yet blitzed at the seventh-lowest rate (24%). \nThe son of NFL legend Deion Sanders fell to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft despite winning Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year during his final season at Colorado. Sanders was the second quarterback Cleveland selected, as the Browns drafted Dillon Gabriel out of Oregon in the third round. Questions remain about where Sanders stands with the organization, as Deshaun Watson is expected to return to the active roster in 2026 and the Browns are still in the process of selecting their new coach, but Sanders joins the elite club of rookies to make the Pro Bowl. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open begins Thursday with a strong field headed to the Torrey Pines South Course in San Diego. Scottie Scheffler, who won his 2026 season debut at The American Express, isn't playing this week, opening up the field a bit for big names such as Xander Schueffele, Ludvig Aberg and Patrick Cantlay. Schauffele is the +1300 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds from FanDuel Sportsbook. Aberg is close behind at +1700, with Cameron Young at +1900 and Cantlay joining Si Woo Kim, Jason Day, J.J. Spaun and Hideki Matsuyama at +2500. Brooks Koepka is also set to make his return to the PGA Tour after leaving LIV Golf, and he's a +5000 longshot. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open 2026 picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its golf betting picks since that point, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Farmers Insurance Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the Farmers Insurance Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, one of the favorites, stumbles and falls well out of the top 5. He's a golfer to fade this week. Kim is off to a hot start this season with a T11 at the Sony Open and a T6 at The American Express last week. He was in the final group on Sunday before before a fourth-round 72. This event has been a struggle for Kim, however, as he has no top-10 finishes in eight tries and has missed the cut twice in his last appearances at this tournament. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Patrick Cantlay a top-two contender this week despite slightly longer odds at +2500. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. He finished T13 at The American Express with four sub-70 rounds. The California native doesn't have a great track record at this event, but he did shoot a first-round 65 last year at Torrey Pines before struggling over the weekend. The model is projecting a more consistent effort for him this year and has him as one of its top 2026 Farmers Insurance Open contenders. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Farmers Insurance Open picksThe model is targeting five other ongshots with odds of +2500 or higher in its list of the top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        For the second time in eight days, the UFC will present a numbered event on Saturday as UFC 325 touches down in Sydney, Australia, for an exciting card emanating from Qudos Bank Arena. Native son Alexander Volkanovski will make his fifth UFC appearance on Australian soil when he defends his featherweight title in the main event in a rematch against Diego Lopes. All-action lightweights Dan Hooker and Benoit Saint Denis will lock horns in a much-anticipated co-feature fight. As we draw closer to the UFC's eighth visit to Sydney in company history, let's take a closer look at the biggest storylines surrounding the event. Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 325: Fight card, date, complete guide as Alexander Volkanovski takes on Diego Lopes in Australia\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n1. How much longer can Alexander Volkanovski stay on top? At 37, the two-time featherweight champion is considered by many as the greatest 145-pound fighter in UFC history thanks to victories over Chad Mendes, Jose Aldo, Max Holloway (three times), Brian Ortega and Yair Rodriguez. And his hard-fought decision win over Lopes last August at UFC 314 awarded Volkanovski the vacant title and a bit of much-needed resurgence following consecutive knockout losses and a skid of three defeats in four fights. Granted, those defeats all came against the current top two fighters in the world (Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria) and two of those came at lightweight. But with Topuria having moved up to 155 pounds, Volkanovski remains the class of the division and sits just two title defenses away from equaling the UFC featherweight record of seven by Aldo. Few fighters have maintained their elite status in the smaller weight classes this deep into their careers and Volkanovski appears as if he still has enough left to add a few more accomplishments to his Hall-of-fame resume entering the Lopes rematch. Even though Volkanovski was dropped in Round 4 of their first fight and visibly hurt twice, he bent but never broke.Watch the first meeting between Volkanovski and Lopes on Paramount+ for as little as $8.99 per month2. Expect a more calculated and dangerous Lopes in the rematchWhen Lopes, a 31-year-old native of Brazil who fights out of Mexico, faced off with Volkanovski in their first meeting last April, it marked his first time in the UFC competing for a title and fighting the five-round championship distance. Ultimately, his inexperience showed as Lopes now admits he completely abandoned his gameplan off the start and found himself desperately searching for a knockout that wasn't to be. One will never confuse Lopes with a technical master like Volkanovski. It's his aggressiveness and fighting spirit that will likely forever be his true calling card. But a more refined and patient Lopes will almost certainly be a more dangerous one on Saturday. And one can expect Lopes to be buoyed by a strong performance in September at Noche UFC when he survived a wild duel with Jean Silva by using his grappling skills early before patiently setting Silva up for what became the finishing blow on a spinning back elbow. In between, Lopes showed his trademark chin and durability in a crazy fight. Should Lopes bring a similarly smart and calculated strategy into the rematch with Volkanovski, it isn't out of the question for him to build upon the success he had late in their first fight and pull a resounding upset to commandeer control of the division. \n3. A refocused Benoit Saint Denis is a legit threat to the lightweight titleIt may have taken two stoppage defeats in 2024 for the former French Army Special Forces soldier to seek a much-needed change after absorbing tremendous punishment against Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano, but the rejuvenated BSD appears to be a new man. Saint Denis switched gyms and now fights under the tutelage of French trainer Nicholas Ott, who also works with middleweight contender Nassourdine Imavov. And the change in both tactics and mindset have done wonders for Saint Denis without muting any of the danger that he brings to the table. Under Ott, BSD is now riding a three-fight win streak following stoppages of Kyle Prepolec, Mauricio Ruffy and Beneil Dariush. In fact, all eight of his UFC wins have come via finish, with his UFC debut loss to Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos in 2021 marking the only time in BSD's 20-fight pro career that the judges were needed. Saint Denis returns Saturday against Dan Hooker in a fight that all but guarantees action and carnage. But the sizable betting favorite BSD, who enters as the No. 8-ranked lightweight, has an opportunity with a win to move within striking distance of the title. 4. It might be win or go home for lovable heavyweight Tai TuivasaDespite still being just 32, which is young for a heavyweight, it's difficult to deny just how much Tuivasa, the hard-charging brawler known for his celebratory shoey beer chugs, could be fighting for his job on Saturday. The native of Sydney will not only snap a 17-month layoff when he faces 6-foot-8 Brazilian slugger Tallison Teixeira, \"Bam Bam\" will be looking to snap a five-fight losing skid which includes four losses by stoppage. Tuivasa has never hidden the fact that fitness and training typically take a backseat to his love of partying but it's time to take his career more seriously before it's over. Tuivasa once won five straight fights -- all by knockout -- from 2020 to 2022 to become a surprising darkhorse title contender. His quick and heavy hands, mixed with his iron will, have made for a number of memorable performances for the crowd favorite who could certainly use a big one this weekend.5. Don't sleep on a pair of lightweight bouts that round out the main cardThe co-main event of Hooker-Saint Denis isn't the only 155-pound bout worth making some time for this weekend. Of the five bouts on the main card, three of them will be contested at lightweight, with a matchup between No. 9 Rafael Fiziev and No. 14 Mauricio Ruffy having all the potential to be a sleep action fight. Fiziev, who has battled injuries in recent years, snapped a three-fight losing skid (which included two decision losses to interim champion Justin Gaethje) by outpointing Ignacio Bahamondes last June. Ruffy, meanwhile, saw his red-hot start of three dynamic wins to open his UFC run get humbled in a big way at the hands of Saint Denis in September when BSD exposed Ruffy's wrestling vulnerabilities in a submission defeat. With lightweight in the midst of major turnover, look for the combination of urgency and desperation to create nothing but fireworks. And don't miss out on the continued rise of Australian prospect Quillan Salkilld, who opens the main card against veteran countryman Jamie Mullarkey. Salkilld may not be getting the same attention as middleweight Ateba Gautier following his breakout 2025 campaign, but three big wins to start his UFC run and a stunning head-kick knockout of Nasrat Haqparast have many taking notice.

Headlined by a thrilling fight that saw Justin Gaethje defeat Paddy Pimblett to win the interim lightweight championship, UFC 324 registered as the platform's largest exclusive live event to date, delivering nearly five million streaming views and seven million households.   By officially saying goodbye to the pay-per-view model, streaming live for Paramount+ subscribers, UFC 324 reached more homes than any UFC live event in nearly a decade across linear, broadcast and streaming. The UFC 324 stream hit a concurrent peak of more than 5.9 million streams.The event was also a hit on social media, serving not only as Paramount+'s most social telecast ever, but also the No. 1 trend for six consecutive hours. UFC 324 saw a 127% increase in mentions from December's UFC 323 PPV.Every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night will stream live on Paramount+ -- no additional fees -- for the duration of the seven-year deal.\nIn Saturday night's main event, Gaethje outworked Pimblett in a five-round bout ended via unanimous decision, becoming the first two-time interim champion in UFC history. He scored multiple knockdowns as part of a performance that may be seen as among the best of the year in mixed martial arts. Gaethje is now in line to unify his interim belt with full champion Ilia Topuria, who has been sidelined while dealing with a contentious divorce.\nUFC 325 is next up on Saturday, airing live internationally from Sydney, Australia. The main card, headlined by Alexander Volkanovski's featherweight title defense against Diego Lopes, will stream live on Paramount+ beginning at 9 p.m. ET.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Our Super Bowl matchup is set, as the New England Patriots will play the Seattle Seahawks at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8. The Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game during a blizzard, 10-7, while the Seahawks outlasted Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams, 31-27. This will be a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX back in 2015 when the Patriots defeated the Seahawks, 28-24, after Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson at the 1-yard line with 20 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Tom Brady threw for 328 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions in that matchup, while Marshawn Lynch rushed for 102 yards and one touchdown. Too bad he didn't get the ball when he should have!Patriots vs. Seahawks feels like an appropriate matchup to end what has been a wonky, unpredictable season. Below, we will examine 10 crazy facts about Super Bowl LX, courtesy of CBS Sports Research. \n        \n            \n                Why an NFL graphic from Week 1 is sparking Super Bowl conspiracy theories after wins by Seahawks and Patriots\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n1. Super Bowl rematches usually favor the original victorPatriots vs. Seahawks will be the 10th Super Bowl rematch in NFL history. The winner of the first meeting is 6-3 in the second meeting, but keep in mind that the Philadelphia Eagles got their Super Bowl revenge on the Kansas City Chiefs just last year.\n2. The Patriots are the most improved team in NFL history (including playoffs)If someone told you they knew the Patriots would be in the Super Bowl before the start of this year, they're lying. New England finished 4-13 in 2024, and fired Jerod Mayo for Mike Vrabel. That was clearly a good decision, as the Patriots just surpassed the 1999 Rams in being the most improved team in NFL history. The Pats went from 4-13 to 17-3 -- a difference of 13 wins including playoffs! The Patriots are also the first team to reach the Super Bowl after a 13-loss season. 3. This is the first Super Bowl matchup since 1981 between teams who had preseason Super Bowl odds of 50-1 or longerNo one expected the Patriots to make the Super Bowl this year, but the same could be said about the Seahawks. After a 10-7 season last year, Seattle made the decision to trade quarterback Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, DK Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers, and release Tyler Lockett. The Seahawks replaced Smith with Sam Darnold, who was coming off a career year with the Minnesota Vikings. There were questions about if he was going to be able to elevate the Seahawks in the most competitive division in the NFL. He certainly did. 4. This will be the first Super Bowl since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger between teams that both ranked top four in scoring offense and scoring defenseWhile this Super Bowl matchup is surprising, the Patriots and Seahawks were undoubtedly two of the best teams in the NFL this season.\n5. This will be the first Super Bowl matchup to ever feature two starting quarterbacks and two head coaches who are in their first or second seasons with their teamsDarnold is in his first season with the Seahawks and Vrabel is in his first season as the Patriots head coach. Maye and Mike Macdonald are in their second seasons with their respective franchises. 6. This could be the third time in the past six years a QB wins a Super Bowl in their first season after joining a teamIt sounds counterintuitive, but apparently riding the quarterback carousel pays immediate dividends. If Darnold wins the Super Bowl, he will be the third quarterback in the past six seasons to win a ring in his first year with a new team. Brady did it in 2020, and Stafford accomplished this in 2021. Before them, this had previously happened just twice in NFL history. 7. Drake Maye will be the second-youngest QB to start a Super BowlIt feels just like yesterday when the Patriots selected the former North Carolina quarterback No. 3 overall in the 2024 NFL Draft. Now, he's on the doorstep of returning the Patriots to glory. Maye will become the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl, behind Dan Marino. He can surpass Ben Roethlisberger as the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl. Maye can also become the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl in the season of his first playoff start since ... Tom Brady. \n8. Mike Vrabel is the second person ever to reach a Super Bowl as a player and a head coach with the same franchisePatriots legend Mike Vrabel joins Gary Kubiak in being the second person to ever reach a Super Bowl as a player and a coach with the same team. He can become the first to win a Super Bowl as a player and head coach with the same franchise. Vrabel played linebacker for the Patriots for eight seasons and won three Super Bowls.9. Mike Macdonald is the third-youngest head coach to make his first Super Bowl appearanceMacdonald (38 years, 213 days) is the third-youngest head coach to make his first Super Bowl appearance behind Sean McVay and Mike Tomlin. 10. Patriots have allowed the fewest points through three playoff games since 2000The Seahawks finished the regular season with the No. 1 scoring defense, allowing 17.2 points per game, but the Patriots' defense this postseason has been historic. The 26 total points New England has allowed through three playoff games are the fewest since the 2000 Baltimore Ravens! Sure, the Patriots had the help of some weather and a backup quarterback in the AFC Championship Game, but this defense suffocated legitimate starting quarterbacks like Justin Herbert and C.J. Stroud. \n            ",

It's the highest that Illinois has been ranked since Nov. 17, when it landed at eighth amid a 4-0 start to the 2025-26 season. The Illini are on a nine-game winning streak, dating back to Dec. 22's victory against SEC foe Missouri, with seven of those wins coming against Big Ten opponents. None were bigger than Illinois' Jan. 24 triumph against Purdue, which plummeted to No. 12 after suffering its first two Big Ten losses of the season last week. Illinois freshman Keaton Wagler put on one of the best performances that college basketball has ever seen from a first-year player. He scored 46 points, a program record for Illinois freshman and tied for the second-most ever from an Illinois player, on 9-of-11 shooting from 3-point range, which set another Illinois record. He also scored all 14 of his team's points to open the game. Texas Tech, meanwhile, continued its ascent to No. 11 after downing Houston on Jan. 24. That was the Red Raiders' second top-15 victory since Jan. 15.

    "body": "\n        After a judge issued a temporary restraining order last week allowing Alabama center Charles Bediako to play for the Crimson Tide despite declaring for the NBA Draft playing in the NBA G League, he made a successful return Saturday, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes in a 79-73 loss to Tennessee. The 10-day court order issued by a local judge was set to expire Tuesday, but the judge extended the temporary restraining order for an additional 10 days due to travel issues for the attorneys representing the NCAA. \nThe extended order would expire on Feb. 6, allowing Bediako to play in Alabama's games vs. Missouri on Tuesday, at Florida on Sunday and vs. Texas A&M on Feb. 4.Bediako doesn't miss a beat in return  Two and a half years after last suiting up for Bama, Bediako looked great in his return, adding a dynamic lob threat to the Crimson Tide's frontcourt.\nHe finished 5-of-6 shooting from the floor -- with four dunks -- and added added three rebounds, two blocks and two steals. It was exactly the type of performance that may make the heartache of doing battle with the NCAA worth it for coach Nate Oats, who thrust his program into the national spotlight in recent days by pushing to get Bediako eligible during the middle of the season.\n        \n            \n                Were Alabama fans cheering Charles Bediako -- or the erosion of the NCAA?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBediako's return to college basketball after his entry into the 2023 NBA Draft has whipped college basketball into a frenzy. The case is only the latest example of how eligibility standards in college basketball are cratering as the NCAA's rules continue to face legal challenges. An Alabama judge granted a temporary restraining order in Bediako's favor Wednesday, clearing the path for his return to the Crimson Tide.He last played for Alabama in the 2022-23 season as a sophomore before remaining in the NBA Draft pool beyond the NCAA's well-established and clearly communicated draft withdrawal deadline. That deadline has long served as a line in the sand for players weighing their futures.\nPrior to the Bediako fiasco, the precedent maintained by the NCAA was this: if you withdraw before the NBA Draft deadline, you can preserve your collegiate eligibility. If you don't withdraw and choose to remain in the NBA Draft, you are forfeiting your future collegiate eligibility. There was never any ambiguity over that until Bediako found a friendly judge who cleared the path for his return.\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Charles Bediako's case could crater college hoops; inside Virginia's rapid rise\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrow in the fact that Bediako signed multiple NBA contracts and has been away from college basketball for nearly three years and you get a messy situation that has stoked the ire of coaches around the country.The precedent now being established by the Bediako case could permanently change the enforceability of the draft withdrawal deadline, further eroding the NCAA's ability to govern college basketball. It's also just the latest domino to fall in a saga that has seen the makeup of college basketball rosters continue to change and skew in a more professional direction.\nWhile some have likened the case to that of Baylor center James Nnaji, who joined the Bears earlier this season after he was drafted No. 31 overall in the 2023 NBA Draft, there are some key differences.A pro career hasn't panned outBediako went undrafted in 2023 and has not played in an NBA game, but he did sign a two-way contract with the Spurs ahead of the 2023-24 season. He's also signed NBA Exhibit 10 deals. Both forms of contracts make him ineligible for college basketball, according to NCAA standards. This is also one key area in which Bediako's case differs from others who have played in the G League before returning to college basketball: Bediako is the first to have been under contract with an NBA organization.Here is an excerpt from the NCAA's statement made by senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt:\n\"Mr. Bediako signed three NBA contracts after competing in college for two seasons. The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any prospective or returning student-athletes who have signed an NBA contract. Eligibility rules ensure high school students get a shot at earning scholarships, and we will continue to consistently apply and defend these rules.\"Charles Bediako was a key player for Alabama for two seasons before declaring for NBA Draft in 2023.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The case for returning to collegeA key point in Bediako's argument for eligibility is that he is within the NCAA's five-year window for eligibility. The clock started when he enrolled at Alabama as a freshman in the 2021-22 season, and the 2025-26 season marks Year 5 on his clock. Since he's within his five-year window and has yet to play in an NBA game, Bediako's representation argues he should be able to play.\"The NCAA's arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement of its eligibility standards is inflicting immediate and irreparable harm upon him,\" said Bediako's lawyer, Darren Heitner, in a statement. \"This harm is particularly egregious given the NCAA's recent decisions granting eligibility to athletes with far more extensive professional experience, revealing a pattern of selective and inequitable application of its own rules.\"Differences between Bediako and Nnaji casesThe case involving Baylor center James Nnaji differs from the Bediako case because, although Nnaji was drafted in 2023 (the same year Bediako went undrafted), Nnaji never signed an NBA contract. Nnaji was also cleared by the NCAA to play for Baylor, whereas Bediako has not been cleared by the NCAA. Nnaji also never appeared in a college basketball game and thus was never subject to the NCAA's NBA Draft withdrawal deadline. Bediako was subject to that deadline in 2023.\nA local judge makes decisionThe temporary restraining order granted by judge James Roberts Jr., a Tuscaloosa County Circuit judge, allowed Bediako to play on Saturday. Roberts' decision drew criticism after it was revealed he is listed as a donor to the University of Alabama's athletic department.  But it won't be the final judicial say on the matter. The initial ruling covers just 10 days, which means Bediako will likely need a preliminary injunction on Jan. 27 if he wishes to continue playing.What Oats said about his roster additionAlabama needs help on the interior, and Bediako profiles as a strong rim protector after leading the Crimson Tide in blocks with 1.8 per game in the 2022-23 season. Though Bediako is averaging just 4.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 0.6 blocks in 15.1 minutes per game for the Motor City Cruise, he size, length and track record of collegiate production could benefit the Crimson Tide. Those attributes were all on display against Tennessee.\n\"He was here not that long ago, and when he was here, he was an elite rim protector, very good post defender, rebounder, very good lob target,\" Alabama coach Nate Oats said. \"And I think his game's continued to develop, and we'll try to use some of the stuff he's developed. But right now, we're just trying to get him used to playing with the players we have.\"What other coaches are saying about BediakoFlorida coach Todd Golden said \"I don't agree with it, and I don't think he should be playing.\" He also added that he doesn't fault Oats for taking a step that could help his team win games.\"We are going to beat them anyway,\" Golden said. \"If he plays, we'll beat them anyways.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Florida's Todd Golden sounds off on Charles Bediako's potential return to Alabama: 'We'll beat them anyway'\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKentucky coach Mark Pope suggested the NCAA Tournament selection committee should not consider results that occurred when a team played someone who is not eligible under NCAA rules.\"The one stop gap that is kind of spreading right now, that maybe has some legs, is that the NCAA does get to decide who gets to go to the NCAA Tournament,\" Pope said. \"They get to decide that. They have that power. \"They've been very, very clear about the rules they're going to try to enforce,\" Pope added. \"They might lose in court, but they still get to decide what games count towards the NCAA Tournament.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams have one of the best rivalries going in the NFL, and soon, they could be taking that rivalry Down Under.The Rams will play the NFL's first-ever game in Australia next season, and although the opponent hasn't been announced, it seems the Seahawks have volunteered for the job. During an interview with the Herald Sun in Australia that took place in late October, the Seahawks' director of international, Isabelle Van Coevorden, made it clear her team was interested in facing the Rams at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\"We would love to,\" she said.Van Coevorden also hinted that the Seahawks have made a direct request with the NFL in hopes of being sent to Australia.\"It's something that we're waiting to hear back from the league. The NFL hasn't announced who their opponent will be,\" Van Coevorden said.\nHer comments were given exclusively to an Australian newspaper, which is likely why they flew under the radar.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Five reasons why Seahawks won NFC to reach big game, including historic rebuild\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe NFL still hasn't announced who the Rams will be playing, but the Seahawks would certainly be an attractive option. Due to the extensive travel involved, sending another West Coast team would make the most sense. The flight time from Los Angeles to Melbourne is almost 16 hours, but a team flying from the East Coast would be looking at well over 20 hours of travel time.With the Rams serving as the designated team, that means their opponent will be one of the nine teams they're scheduled to play at home in 2026: the Cardinals, 49ers, Seahawks, Giants, Packers, Cowboys, Chiefs, Chargers and Bills.\nOut of that group, the 49ers, Seahawks, Cardinals and Chargers are all in the Pacific Time Zone. (The Cardinals are technically on Mountain Standard Time, but Phoenix aligns with Pacific time during daylight saving time.)The NFL has hinted that the game is going to be played in Week 1. Due to the lengthy flight and extreme time difference between the United States and Australia, the league wants to make sure both teams have enough time to get ready for their Week 2 game, so the plan would be to play the Week 1 Australia game early in the week.During an interview back in April, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning, Mike North, revealed that a Wednesday game is one of the possibilities being considered.\n\"I suspect it will probably be early in the week, more like a Thursday, maybe even a Wednesday. That's a possibility that we've discussed,\" North said.Australia has a 14-hour time difference with the Eastern Time Zone, which would certainly create logistical issues for the NFL. For a Wednesday night game to happen, it would have to kick off at 10:15 a.m. Thursday in Melbourne, which would create an 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff on Wednesday night in the United States (and 5:15 p.m. PT on the West Coast).One thing that could throw a wrench into Seattle's hopes of playing in Australia is the fact that the Seahawks are in the Super Bowl. The winner of the Super Bowl generally hosts the Thursday night opener the following season, so if Seattle beats the Patriots, the Seahawks could be scheduled for that game. However, the NFL could still send the Seahawks to Australia and have them host a prime-time game in Week 2. If they're sent to Australia, the Seahawks would still play in the first game of the season -- it would just be in Melbourne.\nAnd let's not forget, if the Rams had won the Super Bowl, they were still going to be playing in Australia next season. The NFL knew there was a chance the Super Bowl champ could open the season Down Under, which is why the Seahawks could conceivably still be sent, even if they beat the Patriots.\"If we do play a game, you will see a lot of Seahawks lead-up and around the game, and if we don't, we will definitely still activate and bring the energy of the Seahawks over to Melbourne,\" Van Coevorden said.It's certainly possible the NFL is waiting to see what happens in the Super Bowl before finalizing whether the Seahawks will be sent to Australia.\nSeattle has been making a strong push to promote the team Down Under. The Seahawks, who were granted marketing rights to Australia and New Zealand in March, sent a contingent to Melbourne in October. The Seahawks even paid for some team legends, the Seahawks Dancers and their mascot to take part in a watch party in Melbourne for their Week 9 game against the Commanders, a game Seattle won 38-14.Van Coevorden thinks a Seahawks-Rams game would be the perfect way to kick things off in Australia.\"I think it's a great matchup and a great first game in Australia,\" she said. \"So, we're really keen on hearing more and our fingers are crossed for sure.\"\nThe Rams and Seahawks faced each other three times during the season, with Seattle winning twice, including Sunday's 31-27 victory in the NFC Championship Game. The 2025 series marked just the third time over the past 75 years that two division rivals played three games in a single season that were all decided by four points or less.The NFL usually tries to avoid sending divisional matchups abroad, but the league softened that stance last year when it sent the Chiefs and Chargers to Brazil. With the Seahawks essentially volunteering for the Australia game, the league could have an easy decision to make -- as long as the Rams are OK losing a home game against a divisional opponent.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Each of the No. 1 seeds in the latest run of the CBS Sports Bracketology model will be in action against formidable conference opposition early this week, and at least one of them is guaranteed to lose. That's because of two of them will be playing each other on Tuesday night, when Michigan hosts Nebraska in a seismic Big Ten clash.Nebraska is holding on to the final No. 1 seed as it heads to Ann Arbor to put its undefeated record on the line against the Wolverines. The Cornhuskers are 10.5-point underdogs, which reflects an analytics profile that is lagging behind its resume. With the nation's No. 2 strength of record and as one of two unbeaten high-major teams left along with Arizona, Nebraska's body of work is strongHowever, it still is not a top-10 team in any of the analytics-oriented metrics that appear on its NCAA team sheet. In fact, the Cornhuskers rate a paltry 17th in the BPI. Upsetting Michigan on the road would help narrow the disparity between Nebraska's record and its ratings.But even if Nebraska loses, the CBS Sports Bracketology model projects that it could still remain a No. 1 seed.

Falling from 10 bids to nine was the ACC, as Stanford dropped out of the field following a 12-point home loss to Cal. The Big East dropped from four bids to three as Seton Hall fell into \"First Four Out\" territory following its fourth straight loss.A Bracketology breakdown by conference as of Jan. 26, 2026. \n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Rematch rulesAmid conference consolidation and the proliferation of nonconference matchups between high-major schools, the NCAA Tournament selection committee faces challenges when it comes to avoiding regular season rematches. The 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket featured three potential second-round games between conference teams, although none of them came to fruition. The committee will still seek to minimize conference meetings and nonconference rematches, and our model is coded to do the same. However, NCAA bracketing principles permit games between conference teams in the second round, so long as the teams in question played each other just once before the NCAA Tournament. For conference teams that met twice prior to the NCAA Tournament, principles state they should not meet prior to the Sweet 16. If the teams played three times, NCAA bracketing principles state they should not play before the Elite Eight.\nWith regard to rematches of nonconference games, NCAA bracketing principles state that they should be avoided \"in the First Four and first round.\" The committee will also \"attempt to avoid\" nonconference rematches in the second round. But the committee has historically prioritized keeping teams on their natural seed line over changing their seed line for the sake of avoiding a rematch. \n            ",

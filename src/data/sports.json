    "body": "\n        We move along with the College Football Playoff this week as No. 6 Ole Miss and No. 10 Miami are set to face off Thursday night in the Fiesta Bowl with a spot in the national title game on the line. This is a fascinating semifinal game for both programs, who have only faced off on the gridiron three times before. Their last contest came in 1951, which resulted in a 20-7 win for the Hurricanes. This marks a return to the big stage for Miami, which has not won a national title since 2001. There's no doubting its validity at this point. The Hurricanes, who just snuck into the 12-team field as the last at-large team at No. 10, went on the road and downed No. 7 Texas A&M in the first round before stunning No. 2 Ohio State, the reigning national champions, in the Cotton Bowl. Miami has relied on a strong defense and a resurgent run game to get to this point. While this is Miami's first time on the national stage in over two decades, this is the closest that Ole Miss has ever been to an actual national championship game. The Rebels do claim three national titles, though their latest came at the conclusion of the 1962 season. \nCFP predictions: Why Ole Miss will win the title | Why Miami will win the titleThough their ranking may not reflect it, Ole Miss has found itself in the role of a scrappy underdog after former coach Lane Kiffin abandoned the Rebels for LSU before their playoff run began. That hasn't been a problem for a team that's rallied behind new coach Pete Golding and what's left of Ole Miss' previous staff. Given all the storylines involved, this promises to be one of the most interesting College Football Playoff semifinal games that we have seen in some time. \nWhere to watch Miami vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, ArizonaTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow along for LIVE updates, highlights and analysis as Miami and Ole Miss tangle for a spot in the College Football Playoff National Championship. Miami vs. Ole Miss: Players to watch in Fiesta Bowl Mark Fletcher Jr., RB, Miami: Miami is slowly learning that it needs to feed Fletcher the ball more. He's been the Hurricanes' offensive hero in their two playoff wins thus far. He torched Texas A&M to the tune of 17 carries for 172 yards in the first round and followed that up with a 19-carry, 90-yard performance against an Ohio State defense that allowed an average of 89.4 yards rushing per game. He also caught a touchdown against the Buckeyes.\nMalachi Toney, WR, Miami: Though Toney is just a freshman, Miami runs plenty of its offense through him. Given how dynamic it is, it's hard to keep the ball out of his hands. His 94 receptions are a single-season program record, regardless of class, and his 1,008 yards receiving set Miami's freshman record. On top of all that, he's also logged 102 yards and a touchdown rushing and he established himself as one of the nation's most dangerous returners while fielding 18 punts for 271 yards. It's no wonder that he was tabbed as CBS Sports' Freshman of the Year.  Rueben Bain Jr., EDGE, Miami: Bain and his running mate, Akheem Mesidor, have started to wreak havoc on opposing offensive lines. Bain almost singlehandedly controlled the game against Texas A&M, as he demolished the Aggies with three sacks and four tackles for a loss. He had 4.5 sacks entering the College Football Playoff. He followed that up with another sack against Ohio State, marking his third game in a row that he's logged at least one sack. The talent is finally starting to shine through for a player that many pundits see as a top-10 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Trinidad Chambliss, QB, Ole Miss: At this point, Chambliss is appointment viewing. His story is well-known: a former Division II star that transferred to Ole Miss with absolutely no fanfare and spent the first few games of the year on the bench before he Wally Pipped preseason starter Austin Simmons. The Rebels haven't looked back since, as Chambliss has emerged as the SEC's best quarterback. He's thrown for 3,660 yards and 21 touchdowns and rushed for another 520 yards and eight touchdowns. He's eclipsed 300 yards passing in four out of Ole Miss' last five games, including a 362-yard performance in the Sugar Bowl against Georgia. Suffice to say Chambliss is an absolute nightmare for opposing defenses. \nKewan Lacy, RB, Ole Miss: Ole Miss has its own star running back. Lacy has been one of the greatest breakout stories of this season as, entering the semifinal round, he's rushed 295 times for 1,464 yards and 23 touchdowns. He had two touchdowns against Georgia and averaged just under six yards per carry against Tulane in the first round. Lacy has exceeded 80 yards on the ground in six of Ole Miss' last seven games while averaging a whopping 5.9 yards per attempt. He and Chambliss are the best backfield tandem left in the playoff. Suntarine Perkins, LB, Ole Miss: Ole Miss is going to have to win in the trenches and near the lines of scrimmage if it wants to beat Miami. The versatile Perkins will be a big part of that. Though he's listed as a linebacker on Ole Miss' roster, Perkins wears a lot of hats for the Rebels defense. Sometimes he'll line up as a pass rusher, where he has 11 tackles for loss, three sacks and 11 quarterback hurries. He'll also play in the middle of the field, where he's an effective run stopper and pass coverage specialist. Perkins has five pass breakups and one interception. Miami vs. Ole Miss prediction, pick \nLost behind the fact that Ole Miss boasts an explosive offense with Chambliss and Lacy leading the way is the fact that the Rebels have played well defensively with former coordinator and now head coach Pete Golding leading the way. They held eight of their opponents to 21 points or less this season. Miami's defensive dominance is well-documented, while the offense has been inconsistent at times. This has the chance to be a slugfest. Don't be surprised if neither team reaches 30 points. Prediction: Under 51.5 (-105)\n            ",

The Hurricanes were the final at-large team selected for the field Miami's path to the semifinals began with a road upset of Texas A&M, followed by a win over reigning national champion Ohio State. Ole Miss followed a different route. The Rebels opened the playoff with a home win over Tulane before stunning Georgia. Their postseason run came amid significant turbulence, as former coach Lane Kiffin departed for LSU days before CFP Selection Sunday. Ole Miss responded by promoting defensive coordinator Pete Golding to head coach, a move that has quickly paid dividends. Thursday's game also features a compelling quarterback matchup between Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss and Miami's Carson Beck.\nPeach Bowl -- (5) Oregon vs. (1) Indiana -- Friday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): There is a chance this quarterback matchup could feature the No. 1 and No. 2 overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza is already drawing significant buzz as a potential top pick, while Oregon signal caller Dante Moore could be the second quarterback selected if he declares. Indiana is coming off the biggest win in program history, and the stakes will be even higher this weekend. Oregon, meanwhile, sits one win away from playing for the first national championship in program history after being eliminated in the quarterfinals last year as the No. 1 overall seed. The Big Ten is guaranteed a spot in the national championship game for the third consecutive season after Michigan and Ohio State represented the league in back-to-back years.\n            \n    ",

Semifinal action begins Thursday night at 7:30 p.m. Eastern when No. 6 seed Ole Miss faces No. 10 seed Miami in the Fiesta Bowl.The winner will advance to face the winner of Friday night's Peach Bowl semifinal between No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon. That all-Big Ten matchup guarantees the conference a spot in the CFP National Championship Game.If a Big Ten team wins the title -- whether Indiana or Oregon -- it would mark the third straight season a different program from the league has been crowned national champion. A Miami title would give the ACC its first championship since Clemson in 2018. Ole Miss would become the SEC's fourth different champion since 2019, joining LSU, Alabama and Georgia.With the season nearing its end, our experts have made their picks for the semifinal matchups. Here's how we see the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl playing out.No. 10 Miami vs. No. 6 Ole Miss \nThursday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free): If Miami struggles to affect Trinidad Chambliss in the pocket, the Rebels win. If the Rebels can't protect their quarterback against defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, the Hurricanes win. Chambliss has escaped pressure most of the season, but so had Texas A&M's Marcel Reed before Miami sacked him seven times in the first round. Ole Miss' defense is solid but not elite, which should allow the Hurricanes to score at least three touchdowns with a multitude of stars who have been kept at bay against two elite defenses in the CFP. Ole Miss has scored 30-plus in eight straight games.  Pick: Over 51.5 -- Brandon Marcello \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

No. 5 Oregon \nFriday at 7:30 p.m. on ESPN, fuboTV (try for free):  Even with the above caveat about it being hard to beat a team twice, I have to stick with Indiana in this game. It's going to be difficult, and I would expect the margin to be closer than the first time around, but Indiana just does so many things so well. I completely trust Curt Cignetti and his coaching staff, I believe in Fernando Mendoza to deliver in the big moments and, ultimately, I think Indiana's defense will give Oregon quarterback Dante Moore problems again.

    "body": "\n        For the fourth time in this College Football Playoff, a rematch is on deck. No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon will meet again Friday night at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta. The previous three rematch results suggests this sequel may favor the Ducks -- teams that won the regular-season meeting are 1-2 in this CFP -- a reality Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti readily acknowledged.\"Hard to beat a team twice, so edge to Oregon there,\" Cignetti said last Friday.Indiana, still unbeaten, handed Oregon its only loss of the season back on Oct. 11 in Eugene, overcoming a fourth-quarter pick-6 thrown by quarterback Fernando Mendoza to pull away for a 30-20 win. Friday's national semifinal marks uncharted territory for Indiana, a program still seeking its first recognized national championship in football. Oregon, meanwhile, is making its second national semifinal appearance of the CFP era, still chasing a title of its own after coming up short in the championship games following the 2010 and 2014 seasons.Where to watch Indiana vs. Oregon liveDate: Friday, Jan. 9 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, GeorgiaTV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nIndiana vs. Oregon: Players to watch in Peach Bowl\n    \n                                        \n    Fernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana: The Heisman Trophy winner had more touchdown passes (3) than incompletions (2) in the Hoosiers Rose Bowl win against Alabama.

He has yet to allow a touchdown reception in coverage and just 27 catches on 50 targets, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Dante Moore, QB, Oregon: Moore had an overall shaky performance in the Orange Bowl win despite completing 78.8% of his passes. Still, he has blossomed into one of the nation's premier quarterbacks and could be a top-five pick in the 2026 NFL Draft if he opts to forgo his final year of eligibility. The Ducks' signal-caller ranks third nationally in completion percentage (72.9%), seventh in passer rating (166.73), eighth in passing touchdowns (28) and 14th in yards per attempt (8.8), showcasing his precision.Jordon Davison, RB, Oregon: Oregon deploys a balanced, three-man rotation in the backfield, but Davison has emerged as its most dangerous finisher. Despite sharing carries with Noah Whittington and Dierre Hill Jr., the true freshman has piled up 667 yards on 113 rushes and found the end zone 15 times on the ground -- a total that ranks among the national leaders.Brandon Finney Jr., DB, Oregon: The true freshman played a big role in the Ducks' shutout win in the Orange Bowl, snagging two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Finney became just the second player in CFP history with three takeaways in a game.\nIndiana vs. Oregon prediction, pick\nCurt Cignetti isn't wrong -- beating a team twice in one season is no small task. Still, there's no reason to doubt the Hoosiers. Oregon's shutout win in the CFP quarterfinal over Texas Tech looked impressive on paper, but the Ducks' offense struggled to find rhythm against a respectable Tech defense. This Indiana defense is arguably better overall. The Hoosiers remain the only team to beat Oregon at home in the last 23 games, and getting them on a neutral field, plus factoring in another long trip to Atlanta after South Florida, gives the Hoosiers a real edge. Prediction: Indiana -4.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Peach Bowl will see Big Ten teams squaring off on Friday as the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers face the No. 5 Oregon Ducks. This 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal contest is a rematch of a mid-October game in which the Hoosiers prevailed on the road, 30-20. That remains the only loss for the 13-1 Ducks, who are coming off a dominant 23-0 shutout win over Texas Tech. As for the 14-0 Hoosiers, they are coming off a 38-3 blowout of Alabama and have aspirations of becoming the first 16-0 team in college football history.Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. ET from Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Hoosiers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Oregon vs. Indiana odds per SportsLine consensus. The over/under for total points is 48.5, having risen 2 points since opening at 46.5. Both teams are 9-5 against the spread this season.

The Ducks have also covered at at 75% clip as an underdog since 2023, while IU is just 5-4 ATS over its last nine versus Big Ten teams. On the field, Oregon possesses the better offense both on the ground and through the air. The Ducks average more passing yards than Indiana, with a higher completion percentage, in addition to averaging more rushing yards, as well as more yards per carry. On the other side of the ball, Oregon is coming off a season-high of four takeaways in the win over Texas Tech, and the Ducks had a pick-six of Fernando Mendoza in the first contest. Mendoza has also been under pressure as of late as he's been sacked three-plus times in four of his last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Indiana can coverNo one can match Indiana's production on both sides of the ball, as it has the No. 2 scoring defense and No. 3 scoring offense, and no other FBS team ranks in the top five of both. The Hoosiers have allowed two touchdowns, total, over their last four games, and they've given up a rushing touchdown in just one of their last nine games. Mendoza leads the nation with both 36 passing touchdowns and with a 184.7 passer rating, and Indiana isn't the type of team that hurts itself. Just one team in all of college football commits fewer penalty yards per game, while just two teams in the country commit fewer turnovers per game.

Just so fun.\"\n\nKim said she won't know the extent of the injury or a timetable for her potential return to the slopes until she has an MRI on Friday. She's hopeful it won't prevent her from competing in the upcoming Olympics, which begin on Feb. 6 in Italy, and noted she has range of motion and isn't in too much pain. \nKim is an eight-time X Games gold medalist in superpipe to go along with her two Olympic gold medals, and figures to be among the favorites again in Milano Cortina. However, after pulling out of the final tune-up event with an undisclosed injury at the U.S. Grand Prix in December, her dislocated shoulder suffered in Switzerland figures to at minimum cause her an unwanted delay in preparations for the Games. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A rematch of two top Big Ten teams will determine which national championship participant comes out of Friday's Peach Bowl in Atlanta.  No. 1 Indiana and No. 5 Oregon have already faced each other this season, a 30-20 win in Eugene for the undefeated Hoosiers. It was a significant program accomplishment for Curt Cignetti in Year 2 of his miraculous Indiana rebuild, especially after an offseason narrative around the Hoosiers' losses to Ohio State and Notre Dame lingered. Indiana definitively proved in that game -- and every game since -- it was no one-hit wonder.  Now the big question is can Indiana do it again? You can call it an overplayed narrative but it can be difficult to beat a team twice in one season. Georgia just learned that the hard way down in New Orleans against Ole Miss.  CFP predictions: Why Indiana will win it all | Why Oregon will win a national title \nIndiana seems to be peaking at the right time, coming into this one off an emphatic 38-3 Rose Bowl win over Alabama. But Oregon is battle-tested, too. The Ducks easily handled their first-round opponent, James Madison, before knocking off Texas Tech, 23-0, in one of the most impressive defensive performances of the season. With Dan Lanning leading the way, this team isn't afraid of anything or anyone.   Indiana vs. Oregon: Need to know for Peach Bowl How does Oregon run game hold up?: Oregon was dealt a significant blow Tuesday when running back Jordan Davison was officially ruled out for Friday's Peach Bowl. Davison, who led the Ducks with 15 rushing touchdowns, suffered a broken clavicle in Oregon's quarterfinal win over Texas Tech. Making the situation even more precarious is that Oregon is now down to only three healthy running backs with Jayden Limar and Makhi Hughes hitting the transfer portal. Fortunately for Oregon it still has Noah Whittington, who led the way with rushing attempts, but it'll be interesting to see how Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein adjusts his gameplan without a significant piece like Davison. Whittington's carries high this season was 17 -- against Iowa and Washington -- but that number will almost certainly have to go up against Indiana if Oregon wants to stay balanced.  Preview of top NFL picks: There is some variance across all the NFL mock drafts you can find out on the internet, but Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore are pretty consistently atop the projections. At CBS Sports, for instance, both Mike Renner and Josh Edwards both have Mendoza and Moore projected to go in the first two picks of the 2026 NFL Draft. We are still a long way from April's draft, but if you're a fan of say the Las Vegas Raiders, New York Jets or Arizona Cardinals, you'll want to tune into the Peach Bowl to watch your potential next franchise quarterback. This is the kind of game that can play big in the minds of NFL executives and scouts when it comes time for the draft. Mendoza, the Heisman Trophy winner, has flown up the draft boards with a terrific season in Bloomington. He hasn't officially declared for the draft but with the Hoosiers taking TCU quarterback transfer Josh Hoover, the signs are there. It's a bit more up in the air with Moore who could still return to Eugene despite the possibility of being a top draft pick. One factor, too: Moore is still just 20-years old and this is his first season as the full-time starter after previously starting five games as a freshman at UCLA.  \nHuge stakes for both programs: Indiana has never been anywhere close to this stratosphere of college football before. A Peach Bowl win over Oregon to send Indiana to its first national championship appearance would be remarkable. There will be books and movies made about Cignetti if he can get two more wins. Oregon has had much more success over the last two decades than Indiana, but still has never won a national championship. Nike co-founder Phil Knight desperately wants to see one. Oregon has played in two national championship games in the 21st century, a 22-19 loss to Auburn in 2011 and a 42-20 loss to Ohio State in 2015. The Ducks have been oh-so-close in the past, and another bite at the apple would be well appreciated in Eugene.   Where to watch Indiana vs. Oregon live Date: Friday, Jan. 9 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET Location: Mercedes-Benz Stadium -- Atlanta, Georgia TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Indiana vs. Oregon prediction, picks \nEven with the above caveat about it being hard to beat a team twice, I have to stick with Indiana in this game. It's going to be difficult, and I would expect the margin to be closer than the first time around, but Indiana just does so many things so well. I completely trust Curt Cignetti and his coaching staff, I believe in Fernando Mendoza to deliver in the big moments and, ultimately, I think Indiana's defense will give Oregon quarterback Dante Moore problems again.

    "body": "\n        History will be chased on Thursday in the College Football Playoff as Miami and Ole Miss gear up for a much-anticipated showdown to kick off the semifinals. The Rebels have already broken the school record with 13 wins and are closer than ever before to winning the school's first solo national title. The Hurricanes, meanwhile, have exceeded the lofty expectations from the preseason, sneaking into the playoff and navigating the most difficult postseason path to reach the semifinals.It's the ACC vs. SEC, a high-flying offense against a big-time defense. It's The U against The New. No matter who wins, the victor will land in the national championship as an unlikely participant. Simply put, No. 10 Miami vs. No. 6 Ole Miss doesn't get much better in terms of stakes and storylines. The Rebels could win a national title without Lane Kiffin, who bolted town for rival LSU -- and grabbed a few Ole Miss assistants -- before the playoff. Miami can cap its long-gestating return to glory under alum Mario Cristobal, who left Oregon three years ago to lift his alma mater back on the national stage.Neither team is short on superstars. Quarterback Carson Beck is the most accurate passer remaining in the playoffs. Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss went from a Division II national champion to a backup on the Rebels' bench to perhaps the most electric player in the postseason. Georgia couldn't keep up with him in the quarterfinals as he led the Rebels to a thrilling, 39-34 comeback victory. \nCFP predictions: Why Ole Miss will win the title | Why Miami will win the titleMiami's defense has been a brick wall, allowing only 17 total points in wins against Texas A&M and Ohio State in the CFP. They sacked mobile quarterback Marcel Reed seven times on the road. Julian Sayin, the nation's most accurate passer, couldn't pick up first downs.The Fiesta Bowl pits two of the most fascinating stories in the CFP.Where to watch Miami vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, ArizonaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow along for LIVE updates, highlights and analysis as Miami and Ole Miss tangle for a spot in the College Football Playoff National Championship. \nMiami vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Fiesta BowlTrench warfare: Miami's postseason run has been highlighted by the incredible pass rush provided by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, who have helped lead the nation's best sack-producing defense. The Hurricanes have 12 sacks in two playoff games and have recorded at least four sacks in four straight games, pushing their total to 46 for the season. Their pressure rate is also an elite 40.5%. Ole Miss only allows 1.3 sacks per game, ranking in the top 20 nationally, and actually ranks behind Ohio State, which gave up six sacks to Miami. Still, the difference for the Rebels is quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, whose mobility kept Georgia out of reach. The Bulldogs had zero sacks and only three tackles for loss in the quarterfinals. Ole Miss is sacked on only 3.1% of pass plays, ranking seventh nationally. Championship pedigrees: Ole Miss has never won a solo national title, and Miami is chasing its first since 2001, but championship-worthy quarterbacks lead both teams in their pursuit of history. Chambliss led Ferris State to a Division II national title last season before transferring to Ole Miss. Carson Beck is 36-5 in his career, including a 15-3 record against ranked opponents. He's the first quarterback to win that many games over three years since 2012-14 (Marcus Mariota). Beck has completed 74.4% of his passes, but in the last two games, he's thrown for fewer than 150 yards for the first time in his career as a starter. Chambliss has thrown for 300-plus yards in eight games this season, including a career high in the win last week against Georgia.Which elite running back steps up?: Get ready for a run-off in Arizona. Miami's Mark Fletcher Jr. has been a bull in the playoffs, especially late in games, rushing for 262 yards in the postseason to rank fourth all-time in CFP history. Ole Miss' Kewan Lacy is a scoring machine, recording rushing touchdowns in the last eight games while picking up an incredible 877 yards over that span. Lacy's 23 rushing touchdowns rank third in SEC history, behind two Alabama running backs who won national titles in their respective seasons.\nMiami vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks\nIf Miami struggles to affect Trinidad Chambliss in the pocket, the Rebels win. If the Rebels can't protect their quarterback against defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, the Hurricanes win. Chambliss has escaped pressure most of the season, but so had Texas A&M's Marcel Reed before Miami sacked him seven times in the first round. Ole Miss' defense is solid but not elite, which should allow the Hurricanes to score at least three touchdowns with a multitude of stars who have been kept at bay against two elite defenses in the CFP. Ole Miss has scored 30-plus in eight straight games.  Pick: Over 51.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred was in studio for a segment on WFAN in New York Thursday afternoon and among the topics broached was expansion and, along with it, realignment. It's been a hot button topic the last few years, as it's been a long time since MLB expanded and the league is currently thriving. While the league is currently balanced with two leagues of 15 teams and six divisions of five, each league having an odd number of teams feels a bit off. And, again, the league hasn't expanded since the Diamondbacks and Devil Rays joined the fray in 1998. The commissioner has long said he wants two expansion teams selected before his term expires in January 2029.\"Thirty-two would be good for us,\" he said, also noting there are a lot of cities that want a Major League Baseball team. \"When people want your product, you oughta try to find a way to sell it to them.\"Mathematically, 32 teams would fit more snugly into leagues than 30, given that you could have 16 teams in each league and eight divisions of four. \n\"It does a ton for us from a format perspective,\" the commissioner said. \"You would realign along geographic lines, which could alleviate a ton of the travel burden that's on players.\" It's a good point. Keep in mind that MLB players travel so much more than players in any other sport, given the 162-game schedule, even with it divided up into 2-4 game series throughout the season. Manfred also discussed what a problem the first round of playoff games can be, logistically, if featuring a team from each coast, making the scheduling either too late for people in the east or too early for people in the west -- and sometimes both. Other leagues, like the NBA, are more cleanly split geographically, allowing the Knicks to play in eastern time and the Thunder in western, for example. \nThe big takeaway there is that Manfred likes the idea of moving away from the American and National Leagues and instead toward East and West leagues. However, he did say he would want to keep the two-team cities \"separate.\" That is to say that the Cubs and White Sox, Mets and Yankees and Dodgers and Angels, respectively, would remain in different divisions.  Upon first glance, that might seem like a tough needle to thread, but not impossible.Even if the Mets and Yankees, for example, were both in an Eastern League, you could group the Yankees with the Red Sox, Blue Jays and Pirates while the Mets could go with the Phillies, Orioles and Nationals. It could work.Regardless, there's a CBA next offseason that needs to be completed and Manfred has also said in previous years that he won't deal with expansion until the stadium situations are resolved for the A's and Rays. \nStill, it's a fun offseason topic of discussion.\n            ",

As well, players in the top 22% of service time between 2-3 years are also eligible. Those latter players are called Super Twos and go through arbitration four times rather than the usual three before being in line for free agency. Big names eligible for arbitration this time around include back-to-back American League Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal of the Tigers, Randy Arozarena of the Mariners, Hunter Brown of the Astros, William Contreras of the Brewers, Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman of the Orioles, and Jazz Chisholm Jr. of the Yankees, among others. \nAs for Thursday's deadline, players file the salary they believe they should be paid in 2026 and teams file the salary they believe the players should be paid for the upcoming season. If the two sides are unable to agree on a figure, they will go to an arbitration hearing where each side will state their case, and a three-person panel will pick either the salary the player filed or the salary the team filed. There's no splitting the difference between the two figures or picking one out of thin air. As such, the system is designed to promote negotiation, and that's typically what happens before a trial is held. Indeed, the vast majority of arbitration-eligible players sign one-year contracts for the coming season prior to the filing deadline. Only a handful actually file salary figures and even fewer go to a hearing. Neither side wants to go to a hearing because the process necessarily entails, on the team side, emphasizing a player's flaws and shortcomings in the name of winning. That can lead to acrimony and a frayed relationship between team and player. Generally speaking, arbitration salaries are based on comparable players at the same service time level. A player with three years of service time who outperformed a player with six years of service time could have a lower 2025 salary because of, well, service time. Service time matters in arbitration. It's not purely about performance. That means the biggest arb-eligible salaries belong to those players who are in the final year of arbitration. Here are the record arbitration salaries heading into this year's deadline: \nJuan Soto, 2024 Yankees: $31 millionShohei Ohtani, 2023 Angels: $30 millionVladimir Guerrero Jr., 2025 Blue Jays: 28.5 millionMookie Betts, 2020 Dodgers: $27 millionNolan Arenado, 2019 Rockies: $26 millionHere now are some of the notable signings from Thursday's arbitration salary filing deadline thus far.Oneil Cruz, Pirates, $3.3 million (FanSided)Ernie Clement, Blue Jays, $4.6 million (FanSided)CJ Abrams, Nationals, $5.2 million (FanSided)Riley Greene, Tigers, $5 million (Detroit Free Press)Gavin Lux, Reds, $5.525 million (New York Post)Shea Langeliers, A's, $5.25 million (FanSided)MacKenzie Gore, Nationals, $5.6 million (FanSided)Hunter Brown, Astros, $5.71 million (MLB.com)Brendan Donovan, Cardinals, $5.8 million (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)Bryson Stott, Phillies, $5.9 million (FanSided)George Kirby, Mariners, $6.55 million (FanSided)Jesús Sánchez, Astros, $6.8 million (MLB.com)Adley Rutschman, Orioles, $7.25 million (FanSided)Jhoan Duran, Phillies, $7.5 million (The Athletic)Steven Kwan, Guardians, $7.725 million (FanSided)David Peterson, Mets, $8.1 million (FanSided)Gunnar Henderson, Orioles, $8.5 million (Baltimore Banner)Jeremy Peña, Astros, $9.475 million (MLB.com)Alec Bohm, Phillies, $10.2 million (The Athletic)Daulton Varsho, Blue Jays, $10.75 million (New York Post)Jesus Luzardo, Phillies, $11 million (Philadelphia Inquirer)Taylor Ward, Orioles, $12.175 million (FanSided)Randy Arozarena, Mariners, $15.65 million (FanSided)Failed to agree to dealJoe Ryan, Twins (MLB.com)Edwin Uceta, Rays (Tampa Bay Times)Graham Ashcraft, Reds (MLB.com)Tyler Stephenson, Reds (MLB.com)Isaac Paredes, Astros (MLB.com)Yainer Diaz, Astros (MLB.com)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 10th-ranked Miami (Fla.) Hurricanes will look to continue their unlikely run to the championship when they battle the sixth-ranked Ole Miss Rebels in a 2026 College Football Playoff semifinal matchup at the Fiesta Bowl on Thursday. Miami stunned defending national champion Ohio State 24-14 on New Year's Eve, while Ole Miss held off third-ranked Georgia 39-34 on New Year's Day. The Hurricanes (12-2, 6-2 ACC), who have won six in a row, are 4-0 against ranked opponents this season. The Rebels (13-1, 7-1 SEC), who have won seven consecutive games, are 2-1 against ranked foes. The Ole Miss coaching staff is in flux, but offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. will be on the sideline for the Rebels and calling plays for quarterback Trinidad Chambliss.Kickoff from State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., is at 7:30 p.m. ET. The Hurricanes are 3-point favorites in the latest Miami vs. Ole Miss odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 52.5.

    "body": "\n        The Indianapolis Colts were the talk of the NFL during the first half of the season not only because of their immense team success but also for their ability to turn quarterback Daniel Jones into the best version of himself. Jones' 13-game sample with the Colts before he suffered a season-ending Achilles tendon tear appears to have been robust enough for the organization to commit to him for at least another year, as general manager Chris Ballard sung his praises and expressed interest in re-signing the former first-round pick.Ballard detailed his ambition to work on a new contract with Jones, who is an unrestricted free agent. The former New York Giants starter signed with Indianapolis last offseason on a one-year, $14 million deal, and his breakout season could spark interest from other teams outside of the Colts. But he may not have any intentions of leaving Indianapolis.\"I think it's mutual on both sides,\" Ballard said of his interest in Jones. \"I think Daniel was a really good fit for this organization, and I think this organization and city were a really good fit for Daniel.\"If there is one obvious reason why other franchises may pump the brakes on courting Jones, it would be the Achilles injury. There is no guarantee that Jones returns to his career-best form after sustaining an injury that so often proves devastating for elite athletes. Ballard admitted that the injury \"of course\" will factor into Jones' free agency and contract negotiation process.\n\"We'll work through that with his agent,\" Ballard said. \"He's got a really good agent. We'll find a way to work through that.\"Anthony Richardson and Riley Leonard will remain under contract in 2026, but neither has the winning track record in Indianapolis that Jones suddenly possesses. And while the Colts could always look for help outside of the organization, sometimes the known commodity is more than just a safe option; it can also be the most fruitful. Jones, after all, won eight of his first 10 starts with the Colts and went 8-3 before suffering the injury in Week 13.\"When you're chasing the quarterback all the time, it makes it very hard,\" Ballard said. \"Your margin for error really shrinks down. I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going. Yes, he's got the Achilles, but I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis. There is some comfort in knowing that we've got a guy that's proven, that's done it and done some really good things.\"\nJones personal-best marks in completion rate (68.0%) and passing yards per game (238.5) this season and led the league with a 52% passing success rate. He was on pace to shatter his career highs in passing yards and touchdowns before his campaign came to a premature end.\n            ",

The College Football Playoff pits those squads against each other in semifinal action this week when No. 6 Ole Miss clashes with No. 10 Miami in the Fiesta Bowl and No. 1 Indiana battles No. 5 Oregon in the Peach Bowl. Those Thursday and Friday contests are set to determine the two squads that will play for the CFP National Championship.From a war between two underdogs to a showdown featuring the potential top two quarterbacks in the 2026 NFL Draft, these semifinals are destined to deliver ample theatrics. Will Miami move one step closer to returning to glory? Can Ole Miss continue the hot start to the Pete Golding era? Only one will prevail in Thursday's bout. Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza then meets Dante Moore again in a compelling rematch on Friday.Both the Ducks and Hoosiers advanced to the penultimate round by way of convincing victories. Their blowout wins over No. 4 Texas Tech and No. 9 Alabama, respectively, made them appear as the top two contenders to win the championship. On the other side of the bracket, the Rebels and Hurricanes both toppled blue-blood opponents in the previous round and planted their flag as worthy title hopefuls.There is a lot of new blood left in the bracket. Oregon is the only team of the bunch to have played in the national semifinals. Indiana, like Oregon, is in search of its first national championship, while Ole Miss has yet to win a title outright and Miami is in the midst of a more than two-decade drought.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game all the way through to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3 | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: (6) Ole Miss vs. (10) Miami -- 7:30 p.m. | ESPN | Predictions, previewState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: (1) Indiana vs. (5) Oregon -- 7:30 p.m. | ESPN | Predictions, previewMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after a standout junior season, he announced. Reese is the No. 6 overall player in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings and projects as a potential top-10 pick.\"Want to say thank you to coach (Ryan) Day and coach Mick (Mickey Marotti) for believing in me and for everything they poured into me,\" Reese wrote on social media. \"Thank you to the entire strength and conditioning staff who pushed me, challenged me, and prepared me for the next level. ... I want to thank all of Buckeye Nation. It was truly an honor to suit up in the Scarlet and Grey. The love and support from this fan base is unmatched.\"I am looking forward to representing my family and my school in the 2026 NFL Draft.\"Reese finished 2025 by recording 69 total tackles (34 solo) with 6.5 sacks. Reese was a finalist for the Butkus Award, which honors the top linebacker in college football. The Ohio State standout is the second-highest-ranked defender in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings behind Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr.\nIn Reese's final game at Ohio State against Miami in the College Football Playoff quarterfinal at the Cotton Bowl, he finished with seven total tackles. The Buckeyes lost to the Hurricanes 24-14, which ended their pursuit of winning back-to-back national titles.Reese's NFL Draft stockReese is the No. 6 overall prospect and the top-ranked linebacker in the CBS Sports NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. However, he could go higher in the draft than his ranking. CBS Sports draft analyst Mike Renner mocked Reese at No. 4 to the Tennessee Titans earlier this week.\"The Titans have plenty of needs, with wide receiver and edge rusher chief among them,\" Renner wrote. \"I lean edge here, given how consistently teams can find receiving talent later in the draft, but it wouldn't be surprising if Carnell Tate were the pick instead. Arvell Reese, though, is more of a wildcard -- a traits-based projection with high-end upside as a pass rusher. He's a modern hybrid linebacker who would add pass-rushing juice from anywhere on the Titans' front seven.\"\nAnother analyst, Ryan Wilson, mocked Reese at No. 2 to the New York Giants.\"An explosive, high-motor LB with a versatile skill set that includes elite closing speed vs. both the run and the pass,\" Wilson wrote. \"He is a terror coming downhill, showcasing his strength and athleticism to shoot gaps, shed blocks and collapse the pocket. Reese is a wrap-up tackling machine who consistently plays with an aggressive edge and the versatility to line up across the front seven. One of the biggest risers over the first month of the college season.\"Impact on Ohio StateReese declaring for the draft should not come as a surprise to the Buckeyes. There is a very real possibility that Reese will be the first non-quarterback selected. In Wilson's latest mock draft, Reese was one of four Ohio State players selected in the first round.Replacing that level of talent won't be easy, but Ohio State is primed to reload for next season on the defensive side of the football. The Buckeyes will not only have to replace Reese, but also standout linebacker Sonny Styles as well, who also projects as a first-round pick.\nOhio State is already busy trying to find its replacements. The Buckeyes landed a commitment from former Wisconsin linebacker Christian Alliegro, who is the No. 146 overall player and the 10th-ranked linebacker in the 247Sports transfer rankings.\n            ",

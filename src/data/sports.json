Petr Yan is the only thing that stands between the UFC bantamweight champion and a series of achievements that will guarantee Dvalishvili goes down as one of the greatest of all time.On Saturday at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Dvalishvili can become the first fighter in UFC's 32-year history to successfully defend a UFC title four times in one calendar year. The lofty achievement all but guarantees Dvalishvili as the 2025 Fighter of the Year and the greatest bantamweight of all time. Before that, he must prove that his first win over former champion Yan wasn't an aberration. Yan is rejuvenated with three consecutive wins under his belt and confidence that he's more physically fit for the rematch.In the co-main event, UFC flyweight champion Alexandre Pantoja has never been stopped in 35 professional fights over 10 years. Challenger Joshua Van, 24, packs a serious punch that he hopes will crown him as the second youngest UFC champion ever. Also on the main card is Olympic gold medalist and former two-division UFC champion Henry Cejudo, who will retire for the second time after fighting popular prospect Payton Talbott.\n\n        \n            \n                Merab Dvalishvili, UFC's ironman, isn't human, he's a 'Machine' as he attempts to make history\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night from Las Vegas.

    "body": "\n        The race for the top of the NFL draft takes another turn in Week 14 when the Tennessee Titans (1-11) visit the Cleveland Browns (3-9) in Week 14. The Titans currently hold the top pick in the draft and desperately need to put more offensive weapons around quarterback Cam Ward. The Browns currently have the fifth pick and are using the end of the season to determine whether Shedeur Sanders can lead the franchise into the future -- or whether they'll need to draft yet another quarterback. The players on the winning team will celebrate, but sentiment may be different in the owner's box.  Kickoff from Huntington Bank Field is set for 1 p.m. ET on FOX. The Browns are 4-point favorites, according to the latest Titans vs. Browns odds. The over/under for total points scored is 33.5.

    "body": "\n        Just when you thought byes were a thing of the past this NFL season, your Week 14 Fantasy football lineups have to account for four teams being off. That includes Fantasy star quarterbacks like Drake Maye and Jaxson Dart being on a bye, which causes a shuffle in the Week 14 Fantasy football QB rankings. Thus, players like Sam Darnold, Jordan Love, Bo Nix and Trevor Lawrence, who are often a part of Fantasy football start-sit decisions, may appear a bit more promising for this week, especially with the uncertain status of Justin Herbert (hand).Meanwhile, the likes of Tyrod Taylor, Jacoby Brissett and even rookie Tyler Shough all ranked among the top 12 in QB Fantasy points last week. Are any of them worth considering starting with some leagues beginning their 2025 Fantasy football playoffs this week? Before making your Week 14 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 14 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 14 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 14 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 14 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 14: The model is fading Bears QB Caleb Williams, who has 10 total touchdowns, versus just one interception, over his last five games and is the QB8 this season. Williams, who has an over/under of 193.5 passing yards this week, has been the catalyst to Chicago sitting atop the NFC standings and having the No. 6 total offense, and while he's been efficient as of late, he hasn't been overly productive. He's had one or fewer touchdown passes in seven of his last nine games, and with Chicago going 8-1 over that stretch, the Bears won't tinker with their offensive strategy. Chicago takes on Green Bay on Sunday, with the Pack allowing the sixth-fewest Fantasy points to quarterbacks in 2025. Williams averaged just 189.5 passing yards versus the Packers last season, with one total touchdown. Williams may not warrant a spot in Week 14 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 15 in quarterback rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Dolphins tight end Darren Waller, who is the TE30 in standard leagues and the TE37 in PPR scoring. The veteran began the year sidelined, then played in a few games only to then head to IR, so he may have flown under the radar for many as he's only being started in 39% of leagues. But he returned to play last week and had 47 receiving yards, despite playing less than half of the snaps. Over his four games this year in which he received targets, Waller's averaged 41 yards with four total touchdowns. That scoring prowess has a great chance to continue in Week 14 versus the Jets, who have allowed the second-most touchdowns to tight ends. Even when not allowing scores, the Jets are still allowing yards to the position as Kyle Pitts (82 yards) had his most yards in over a calendar year versus New York last week.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 14 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising quarterback could lead you to victory?

He's shown off a solid kickboxing game, a lethal squeeze on his chokeholds and great durability and determination. Duncan fights with a hard-nosed style and refuses to be denied even when the fight isn't going his way. McKinney is an explosive finisher who is always dangerous. In his 17-7 pro career, McKinney's fights have gone past the first round just twice. He has never fought to a decision and has been finished in all of his losses. McKinney's flying knees and rear-naked chokes could put Duncan in danger, but I believe Duncan's mentality and physicality will give him the edge. If Duncan lands a heavy counterpunch in traffic, McKinney might not stand back up.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 323: Dvalishvili vs. Yan 2 picksVithlani has strong picks for Dvalishvili vs. Yan and other bouts on the UFC 323 card.

Meanwhile, Burrow has missed most of the season due to a toe injury, but he returned on Thanksgiving last week and promptly led Cincy past Baltimore. Kickoff from Highmark Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET on FOX. The Bills are 5.5-point favorites, according to the latest Bengals vs. Bills odds. The over/under for total points scored is 53.

The Broncos (10-2) have won nine in a row but have had some close ones, including last week's overtime victory against Washington. And while the Raiders (2-10) have had little to write home about this season, they managed to hold Denver in check in a 10-7 road loss in Week 10.     Kickoff from Allegiant Stadium is set for 4:05 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 SEC Championship Game will see the No. 4 Georgia Bulldogs meet the No. 9 Alabama Crimson Tide on Saturday. This is the fifth SEC Title Game meeting between the programs, with Bama winning the previous four. Georgia (11-1, 7-1 SEC) is coming off a Friday win over Georgia Tech, 16-9, while Alabama (10-2, 7-1 SEC) enters off a Saturday victory over Auburn, 27-20. The Tide have won a record 11 SEC Championship Games, while Georgia has won five times previously. Both teams are virtually locked into the College Football Playoff field, though the winner will likely claim a first-round bye. Alabama lists running back Jam Miller, offensive lineman Kam Dewberry and tight ends Josh Cuevas and Danny Lewis Jr. as questionable. Georgia safety Zion Branch is also listed as questionable.Kickoff is at 4 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Tide have won three straight meetings with Georgia, including a 24-21 win on Sep. 27. The latest Georgia vs. Alabama odds have the Bulldogs favored by 1.5 points, while the over/under for total points is 48.5.

Georgia ran all over Bama in their September matchup to the tune of 227 yards on 6.9 yards per carry. That's the most yards Bama allowed to an SEC team all year, and the Tide run defense is still shaky after giving up 152 yards on the ground to Auburn last week. Georgia boasts running back Nate Frazier, who ranks sixth in the SEC with 5.6 yards per carry, as well as receiver Zachariah Branch, who tops the SEC with 68 catches. Also, one can't dismiss that Georgia last played on Friday, with Bama on Saturday, and the Tide have covered just once over their last six games when having a rest disadvantage. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Alabama can coverBama has two streaks in its favor over Georgia, starting with the fact that the Tide are 4-0 all-time versus the Bulldogs in the SEC Title Game. Additionally, Alabama has won each of its last three meetings with UGA, with two of those coming since Kalen DeBoer replaced Nick Saban. This season, the Crimson Tide are 8-4 ATS, whereas the Bulldogs are just 5-7 versus the line, including failing to cover in each of their last two games. Bama quarterback, Ty Simpson, owns a 25:4 TD:INT, and he's complemented by a defense which has been its typical dominant self as of late. The Tide haven't allowed more than two touchdowns in each of their last five games, and they'll see a team on Saturday that has a negative turnover differential on the season. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Alabama vs. Georgia picksSportsLine's model has simulated Georgia vs. Alabama 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time. You can only get the pick at SportsLine.   So who wins Alabama vs. Georgia, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

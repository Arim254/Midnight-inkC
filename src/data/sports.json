But the Steelers are coming off a crucial 27-22 win over the Ravens last week to exit Week 14 a game over Baltimore in the AFC North with four games left. Rodgers threw a season-high 284 yards last week. Miami has won four straight games, but three of those came against teams that entered Week 15 with 3-10 records. Pittsburgh, especially on a road, is a significantly tougher challenge for Miami, and the Steelers have all the value in the model's simulations.Over 42.5 pointsThe Dolphins are coming off a 34-point performance against the Jets, scoring at least 30 points in a game for the third time over their last six contests. Miami is averaging 23.5 ppg over those six games, as the Dolphins have rebounded from a 1-6 start and calls for head coach Mike McDaniel to be fired. McDaniel has been one of the more creative offensive playcallers over the last few years, and that has been showcased in recent weeks. Rodgers is coming off one of his best games of the season, and the Steelers have scored at least 27 points in three of their last four games. The model projects the Over to hit in 56% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

Pittsburgh (7-6) is coming off a 27-22 win over Baltimore and sits atop the AFC North. Edge rusher T.J. Watt (lung), guard Andrus Peat (concussion) and cornerback James Pierre (calf) have been ruled out for Pittsburgh.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh. The latest Dolphins vs. Steelers odds from DraftKings Sportsbook have Pittsburgh as 3-point home favorites after the opening line was -3.5, while the over/under for total points scored is 42.5.

Miami's defense has risen to the occasion as of late, holding each of its last four opponents to 17 points or fewer while also notching 10 takeaways during this stretch. On offense, Mike McDaniel has a rushing unit that ranks fifth in yards per carry and eighth in yards per game. De'Von Achane is on pace for nearly 2,000 scrimmage yards, while Jaylen Wright had 107 yards and a touchdown last week. The Dolphins also get to face a Pittsburgh defense that is reminding no one of the Steel Curtain, as the Steelers rank 27th or worse in total yards allowed, passing defense and third-down defense. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Steelers can coverThis game is in Pittsburgh at night, which plays into the forecast calling for a game time temperature of 25 degrees. That's relevant because Miami has lost 13 straight games with temps under 40 degrees, as Tua Tagovailoa is 0-8 in his career in such contests. The Dolphins quarterback has had a season to forget, as he leads the NFL with 14 interceptions and now has to face a Pittsburgh defense which has racked up the second-most takeaways (23). As for Aaron Rodgers, he's coming off a season-high of 284 passing yards and also rushed for his first score since 2022 in last week's win over Baltimore. He faced the Dolphins twice last year while with the Jets, and the four-time MVP totaled five passing touchdowns and averaged 306.5 yards through the air. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Steelers vs. Dolphins           picksFor Dolphins vs. Steelers on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 46 combined points.

The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule really kick into gear this week, however, with 10 matchups on the schedule, including the first round of the College Football Playoff. No. 8 Oklahoma is a 1-point underdog against No. 9 Alabama on Friday in the latest college football odds.Saturday is nothing but CFP action, and the latest College Football Playoff lines are No. 7 Texas A&M (-3.5) vs. No. 10 Miami, No. 6 Ole Miss (-17.5) vs. No. 11 Tulane and No. 5 Oregon (-21.5) vs. No. 12 James Madison, with the higher seed hosting all of those games on campus.

Both schools vastly underperformed this year but had strong finishes, with each finishing the season 3-1 ATS. However, Dabo Swinney has lost four of his last six bowl games, with each defeat coming by at least 14 points. This year, his Tigers are averaging 28.7 points, which ranks 61st in the nation, while Penn State, despite playing in the much tougher Big Ten, ranks 37th nationally in scoring. Also, the location of this game in New York City favors a northeastern university like Penn State over Clemson from South Carolina. The Nittany Lions cover almost 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-6.5, 48.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in well over 50% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

This was not a decision I took lightly. However, when circumstances arise that threaten your personal integrity, your family, and your reputation, there comes a point when you must address them directly. In recent months, I have been subjected to severe and unacceptable pressure, including threats to disseminate false allegations of domestic abuse unless financial demands were met. These allegations are entirely unfounded. The truth is not a matter of opinion -- it is a matter of evidence. All relevant evidence has been carefully preserved and documented, including audio recordings, written communications, witness statements, and video material. This evidence has been submitted to the appropriate judicial authorities in order to pursue legal action for attempted extortion, falsification of evidence, misappropriation of funds and personal property, and multiple threats. Topuria said he will not release any more public statements until the matter is resolved and asked that \"speculation be avoided,\" as his absence has fueled many rumors among fans wondering what was the cause of his absence. Topuria (17-0) won the lightweight title in February 2024 with a knockout of Alexander Volkanovski and has defended that title successfully with two more knockout victories over Max Holloway and Charles Oliveira. With those victories, Topuria has climbed the ranks of UFC's elite, currently sitting at No. 2 on CBS Sports' pound-for-pound rankings. \nHowever, he has not fought since his June 2025 victory over Oliveira, and appears set for an extended absence from the Octagon while his legal situation gets sorted out. \n            \n    ",

Now, it has revealed its top anytime touchdown picks for Steelers vs. Dolphins.Best Monday Night Football anytime TD prop picks:De'Von Achane, Dolphins (-130)Kenneth Gainwell, Steelers (+170)Darren Waller, Dolphins (+245)\nDe'Von Achane, Dolphins (-130)With 34 touchdowns in 41 career regular-season games, Achane has a clear nose for the endzone, and he's Miami's best offensive weapon by a wide margin at this point. He's averaged nearly 100 yards from scrimmage per game since he arrived in 2023, and he leads the NFL in yards per carry (5.8) entering Week 15. Now he'll go up against Pittsburgh's 21st-ranked run defense, and the model is predicting that he scores 0.68 touchdowns, while these odds imply a 56.5% chance to score.\nKenneth Gainwell, Steelers (+170)After four seasons as a reserve in Philadelphia, Gainwell has carved out a more meaningful role for himself in the Pittsburgh offense. He's carried the ball 80 times for 371 yards and four touchdowns while catching 50 passes for 286 yards and two scores. He's reached double-digits in touches three of his last four games and has scored three times during that span. The model predicts that he scores 0.40 touchdowns on average, while the odds imply a 37% chance to score.\nDarren Waller, Dolphins (+245)Waller was a surprise trade acquisition during the preseason, and it took him several weeks to get into game shape after a year off from the NFL, but he scored four times in his first three games after debuting in late September. Then he was sidelined for a little over a month with an injury before returning to action two weeks ago. He's played fewer than 50% of the offensive snaps in two games since, but with Miami working its way back into contention, it might be time to turn the veteran tight end loose. The model predicts that Waller scores 0.39 touchdowns on average, while it's implied that he has a 28.2% chance to score.\nWant more Monday Night Football picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown prop picks for several players in Steelers vs. Dolphins.

    "body": "\n        The first major domino in the 2026 college football transfer portal has fallen. Florida quarterback DJ Lagway intends to enter the portal, he announced, ending his two-year run with the Gators. He figures to be among the most prized targets of the offseason and could be the top-ranked transfer quarterback on the market.Lagway will command attention from top teams, and will be a plug-and-play starter wherever he lands. The former No. 3 overall recruit was among the most promising young quarterbacks in college football over the last two seasons. Even though 2025 came with more struggles than anticipated, his ceiling remains tremendously high.The looming departure from Florida comes after a coaching change. Lagway was in many ways a lifeline for Billy Napier toward the end of his tenure, but when the offense failed to live up to expectations, the Gators moved on from their coach and tabbed Jon Sumrall as his replacement. Lagway was a vocal supporter of Napier throughout his time in Gainesville and is now set to leave shortly after his former coach's ouster.\"First and foremost, I want to thank God for every blessing he has placed over my life,\" Lagway said in his announcement. \"I am truly grateful for the opportunity to have been part of such an incredible program here at the University of Florida. To my family -- your unwavering support means the world to me. I would not be the man or the athlete I am today without your love, guidance, and sacrifice.\n\"To my friends and teammates -- thank you for the brotherhood, the memories, and the bonds we've built over these past two years. I will carry those moments with me for a lifetime. To my coaches, the athletic training staff, and every member of the University of Florida community -- thank you for pouring into me, believing in me, and showing me nothing but love and support throughout my time in Gainesville. After much prayer, reflection, and thoughtful consideration, I have decided to enter the transfer portal.\"Despite throwing an SEC-high 14 interceptions during his first full season as a starter, Lagway continued in 2025 to show the tremendous flashes of greatness that sparked enthusiasm during his freshman campaign. For instance, he closed the year on a high note with a three-touchdown game against rival Florida State. Lagway completed 63.2% of his throws for 2,264 yards and 16 touchdowns on the year and ran for an additional 136 yards and a score.\nLagway brings two years of eligibility remaining when he enters the 2026 season at his destination school. His highly regarded tools make him a candidate to depart for the NFL Draft at the end of his junior campaign.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs' unique, extended stay on injured reserve because of the health of his knee continues to confound.Diggs said on Friday that he felt he was healthy enough to play on \"Sunday Night Football\" against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15, but Dallas opted not to activate the two-time Pro Bowler on Saturday. That surprised and upset Diggs after he said he had been part of the defensive game plan in practice all week. It appeared that way in the media viewing portion of practice with Diggs lining up as one of the Cowboys' three starting corners with DaRon Bland and Shavon Revel Jr. at times on Friday. \"Going into the week, that was the plan, for me to play. I was included in the game plan to play, and [Saturday] I was told I wasn't playing, so that's why I thought I was playing,\" Diggs said postgame. \"It was a quick decision. I thought I was going to come out here and play, but they felt otherwise. That's just what it was.\" Instead of suiting up, Diggs watched from the AT&T Stadium sideline as struggling Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy diced Dallas up for a career-high 250 yards passing while throwing two touchdowns, an interception on 15 of 24 passing while also rushing for a touchdown in a 34-26 defeat. McCarthy entered Week 15 with the NFL's lowest completion percentage (56%), touchdown-to-interception ratio (9-10, 0.9) and passer rating (67.4) this season among 34 qualified quarterbacks.  \nThe Cowboys ruled out Diggs the Friday before Week 7 against the Washington Commanders after the cornerback suffered a concussion in an accident at his home. While Diggs was in concussion protocol, Dallas put him on injured reserve because of his knee being reaggravated, and he hasn't played since, missing the last eight games. The Cowboys opened up Diggs' 21-day practice window to work his way back to a return from injured reserve on Nov. 30, and he has until Dec. 20 at 4 p.m., the day before the Cowboys' Week 16 home finale against the Chargers, to be activated. Otherwise, Diggs will remain on IR and not return to play this season. \"I hope I can play. I hope they decide I can play. I feel good enough to play, so we'll just have to see,\" Diggs said. \"It's not my decision. Me personally, I feel good. I feel healthy. I feel ready, so I just have to wait. ... I feel like I can make a big difference. I feel like I can contribute. I feel like I can help this team win.\"The Cowboys are allowing the second-most points per game (30.0) in the NFL this season and the most passing yards per game (254.8) in the league, so one would think any and all help, especially the help from the NFL's 2021 interceptions leader. \n\n        \n            \n                Cowboys react as former All-Pro Micah Parsons fears torn ACL; owner Jerry Jones declines comment\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDallas' side of the storyCoach Brian Schottenheimer said Diggs \"had a better week\" in Week 15, but he made it clear the team feels \"differently\" about his health status. \"As we've talked about, when he's ready to go, I know he feels ready to go. And again, I love that for him as a competitor, I love that,\" Schottenheimer said postgame. \"But at the end of the day, we felt differently.\" Owner and general manager Jerry Jones provided a direct answer as to why Diggs remains sidelined: he's not healthy despite Diggs feeling like he is. \n\"Diggs isn't healthy enough to be out there for us. Period,\" Jones said postgame. \"You have to look at practices and if they practice good enough. Whether it's a limitation they've had in recent games or a long-term injury, you've got to make your mind up when you see him practice. When we looked at practice, we didn't like what we saw relative to his health and ability to make plays.\"So who is making the call each week about whether or not it's time to activate Diggs? Well, it's a few different people. \"It can be [the] training [staff]. It can be [the team] doctor. It can be Schotty's call,\" Jones said. \"It can be a behavior call. A lot of ways that you have to evaluate where you are to get on the field.\"\nJones' answer is partially why Diggs remains confused about his own situation: he feels like there's a moving target about what he actually needs to do to make his return to play. \"I don't know the special requirements that I need to show that I can play. I've been in practice. I've been practicing well. I've been running around, doing what I'm supposed to do,\" Diggs said. \"You know it's not my decision at the end of the day. We have to wait and see come Monday or whenever we go back to practice, just do what I can do to show that I'm ready to play and go from there.\"Schottenheimer agreed that it's \"different things\" that Dallas needs to see from Diggs and that \"consistency\" is still what is being desired from the cornerback moving forward. \n\"Different things. Consistency. I think I've been very honest about that with all of our players. There's things that they need  to do from a consistency standpoint to make us feel good about putting him out there,\" Schottenheimer said. \"And again, I know he felt like he wanted to play, and he felt like he was ready to play. Like I said, we made a decision as a team. and I made a decision, and we went in a different direction. So we'll see how this week goes.\" Defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus spoke about needing to be \"wired in\" during team meetings and in practice was key as was asking questions to make sure responsibilities were clear. The unclear handling of Diggs' situation, in his own eyes, has led to disappointment. \"Definitely disappointed because I definitely thought I was coming out here going to play and be able to help these guys try to pull out a win,\" Diggs said. \"I think how it was handled I didn't like that because I thought that I was playing. It is what it is. Try to focus on next to see if I could show them whatever they want to see. I'm going to show them and go from there.\"\nQuarterback Dak Prescott has been helping Diggs work through his \"tough\" situation by advising him to stay positive, control what he can control, be there for teammates and show up in practice.\"I had a conversation with him when he told me about the news that they gave him about not playing, and it was just about keeping his head up,\" Prescott said postgame. \"I told him simple as this, 'go Monday, ask what they expect from you. So you have the plan throughout the week, so you can make sure you do exactly that. So you know what's needed for you to become active and to get back to being the guy that you are.' He accepted that.\" Diggs said he also accepted the coaching staff telling him they needed more from him in practice, but he feels his shift in improving how he's handled practice hasn't changed anything. \n\"From the first conversation that we had, it was practice. I guess I wasn't showing them what they wanted to see in practice, and this week I showed them what they wanted to see in practice, and it's still the same results. So I don't know what else I need to do or to show at this point. I feel like it's not up to me or what I do. It's really up to them and what they want to do. So I'm just showing up every day and going to work.\"Dallas divorce? If the Cowboys want to move on from Diggs prior to the third season of his five-year, $97 million contract, they would save around $12.6 million in cap space if he is released before June 1 in 2026. A post-June 1 release would free up $15.5 million. Diggs' $19.4 million average per year salary is tied for the 10th-highest at the cornerback position, according to OverTheCap.com.  So does a player whose 20 career interceptions since entering the NFL in 2020 are tied for the second-most in the league, just one behind Pro Bowl safety Justin Simmons' 21 in that span, feel like he needs to show he can still play? \n\"That would be nice,\" Diggs said. He acknowledged he's seen rumors online about his future no longer being with the Cowboys, but if it's up to him, Diggs would like to remain with Dallas in 2026 and beyond. \"Of course [I want to be here next season]. Dallas is a great place. I have a great relationship with these guys. They're like my brothers, so of course I want to be here, but at the end of the day, it's a business,'' Diggs said. \"I don't know what the future holds. It's in God's hands, so I'm just doing what I can do: showing up where I can show up and go from there.\"Jones ducked a question about if he sees Diggs finishing out his contract and pointed toward the 27-year-old's 29 games missed since 2023, so the ambiguity around Diggs' future remains, which is a sign itself. \n\"I don't have to look at that right now. We of course are very disappointed that he hadn't had more play time this year,\" Jones said. \"Frankly, I'm disappointed that he hadn't had play time over the last several years, and his injuries have a lot to do with that.\"\n            ",

Kyle Schwarber kicked things off the Winter Meetings by agreeing to a five-year, $150 million contract to return to the Phillies. Edwin Díaz, meanwhile, is joining the World Series-champion Dodgers and slugger Pete Alonso is headed to the Orioles for five years and $155 million.Earlier this winter, right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Kyle Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Alex Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Framber Valdez and Ranger Suárez could frontline almost any rotation.\nJosh Naylor became the first notable hitter to ink a new deal this offseason, heading back to Seattle in the winter's first major free agency deal. He's re-signing with the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million deal. The American League pennant-winning Toronto Blue Jays, meanwhile, brought Dylan Cease north of the border on a massive seven-year, $210 million contract, while the Mets signed closer Devin Williams after a disappointing 2025 season with the crosstown Yankees.A record four players -- Brandon Woodruff (Brewers), Shota Imanaga (Cubs), Gleyber Torres (Tigers) and Trent Grisham (Yankees) -- accepted the qualifying offer and are returning to their respective teams for 2026.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top 50 MLB free agents for 2026: Kyle Tucker, Alex Bregman at top, plus landing spots for every player\n                \n                    R.J.

    "body": "\nAn AFC matchup will put a bow on NFL Week 15 as the Miami Dolphins visit the Pittsburgh Steelers on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. A MNF SGP could consist of NFL picks on the money line, which will be very popular considering Pittsburgh's eye-popping streak. The Steelers have won 22 straight home games on 'Monday Night Football', last losing in 1991. If you expect that run to continue, and for Pittsburgh to win with points to spare, then you could also group in NFL picks against the spread with your Dolphins vs. Steelers SGP.Pittsburgh is favored by 3 points aft DraftKings Sportsbook, and outside of any money line or spread predictions, you could also include NFL props in your 'Monday Night Football' same-game parlay. The receptions O/U of 4.5 is a popular one, as DK Metcalf, De'Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle all have that receptions bar. Should you target those, or pursue MNF props involving Aaron Rodgers or Tua Tagovailoa? Before locking in any Steelers vs. Dolphins picks for your 'Monday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the Dolphins vs. Steelers prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins to bet on props like Jaylen Waddle anytime TD scorer:\nBuilt using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each player prop. Now, the model has analyzed Steelers vs. Dolphins on 'Monday Night Football' and locked in three confident best bets for an NFL SGP. If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of 6-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Pittsburgh vs. Miami here.Top Monday Night Football SGP picksAfter simulating Dolphins vs. Steelers, SportsLine AI says Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers goes Over 210.5 passing yards (-114). The four-time MVP had his most yards in a Steelers uniform last week with 284 through the air, which came on the road versus a Baltimore defense which had allowed 179.7 passing yards over its prior three games. Meanwhile, Miami has allowed 212.8 passing yards over its last four and has been shredded through the air all season.The Dolphins are giving up an NFL-high completion percentage of 69.9%, which is on pace to be the 11th-highest allowed in a season in NFL history.

    "body": "\nThe last chance to join NFL DFS contests for Week 15 comes on 'Monday Night Football' when the Pittsburgh Steelers host the Miami Dolphins at 8:15 p.m. ET. While those in the passing game like Aaron Rodgers, Tua Tagovailoa, D.K. Metcalf and Jaylen Waddle will garner lots of interest as NFL DFS picks, both teams rank in the bottom 10 in pass offense. Thus, if you still want to utilize pass catchers from the MNF DFS player pool, perhaps, it would be a better daily Fantasy football strategy to target lower cost receivers as they would be less risky options.Miami tight end Greg Dulcich is averaging 30.8 receiving yards over his last five games, while Pittsburgh's Darnell Washington is averaging 36.5 yards over his last four. It may not be the worst NFL DFS advice to roster them instead of spending up on the likes of Darren Waller or Jonnu Smith. Before making any Dolphins vs. Steelers DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Monday Night Football', be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. \nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Monday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Dolphins vs. SteelersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Monday Night Football' is Waddle. The fifth-year receiver has upped his production since Tyreek Hill was injured as he's averaged over 70 total yards since Week 5. Waddle had 50 receiving yards, 21 rushing yards and a touchdown a week ago and now gets to face a porous secondary in Pittsburgh. The Steelers have allowed the most catches of any team to opposing wideouts while giving up the second-most receiving yards to the position. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Waddle to go Over 63.5 receiving yards at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Steelers running back Kenneth Gainwell. The former Eagle has become a bigger part of Pittsburgh's offense as of late, averaging 12.3 touches over his last four, after averaging just 5.3 touches over his prior four games. Gainwell's made the most of these opportunities as he ranks as the RB9 in Fantasy over the last four weeks. Meanwhile, Miami has the No. 25 run defense, and just four teams are allowing more yards per carry than the Dolphins. Thus, Gainwell has the potential to supply lots of value to your MNF DFS lineups and he won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Gainwell to go Over 22.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Steelers vs. Dolphins DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Monday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Coming into it, Week 15 had the potential to be the defining weekend in the NFL and it's living up to that billing. There were several playoff scenarios at play this weekend, and the overall picture is starting to crystallize. One thing that is not wrapped up, however, is the AFC East crown. The New England Patriots had an opportunity to secure the division on Sunday with a win, but the Buffalo Bills rallied from a 21-point deficit to keep those hopes of winning the AFC East alive for at least another week. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Bengals are officially eliminated from the playoffs after the Baltimore Ravens secured a key AFC North win to keep their playoff pursuit going. Maybe the most significant development, however, came at Arrowhead Stadium where the Kansas City Chiefs have been officially eliminated from playoff contention. Moreover, Patrick Mahomes left the contest late in the fourth quarter due to a left knee injury, which has since been revealed to be a torn ACL. The late afternoon window then took the baton from the early slate, and ran with it. The Los Angeles Rams clinched a playoff berth with their win over the Detroit Lions, as did the Denver Broncos after outlasting the Green Bay Packers in a heavyweight showdown from Mile High. Meanwhile, the Carolina Panthers had an opportunity to sit atop the NFC South, but found themselves on the wrong end of the scoreboard with the New Orleans Saints pulling off the upset. \nWith an epic Week 15 slate unfolding before our eyes, now is the perfect time to take a live look at the playoff picture. Below, we'll break down who's currently in and out of the postseason.AFC standingsx-Denver Broncos (12-2)New England Patriots (11-3)Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Buffalo Bills (10-4)Houston Texans (9-5)x-clinched playoff berth\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (12-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersAfter winning their 11th straight game thanks to a 34-26 victory against the Green Bay Packers, the Broncos are 12-2 and have officially clinched a playoff berth. They have a solid cushion in the AFC West, and have even more breathing room in their pursuit of the No. 1 seed thanks to Buffalo defeating the New England Patriots. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (11-3)Remaining schedule: at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had an opportunity to clinch the AFC East with a win over Buffalo on Sunday, but blew a 21-point lead in Week 15 to snap their winning streak. New England remains in first place in the division, but the Bills are lurking. \nBeyond Buffalo, this loss currently doesn't help the Patriots in their pursuit of Denver for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars have now won five straight games following a blowout victory against the New York Jets. That helps keep them in first place in the AFC South over the surging Houston Texans.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Remaining schedule: vs. Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensPittsburgh is back in first place in the AFC North after defeating the Ravens; however, there's still a lot to be determined in this division. Baltimore just took down the Cincinnati Bengals, so a lot will be riding on the Steelers' matchup against the Miami Dolphins on Monday night, especially with another head-to-head matchup with Baltimore still on deck in Week 18. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers notched their 10th win of the season and eliminated the Kansas City Chiefs from playoff contention on Sunday with a nail-biting win at Arrowhead. That victory not only keeps them as the No. 1 wild card team, but they are still within range of Denver in the AFC West. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Buffalo Bills (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt cannot be overstated how important Buffalo's comeback win over the Patriots was. After erasing another double-digit deficit, the Bills are still alive in the AFC East race, meaning there is still a line to a higher seed and a home playoff game.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (9-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Raiders, at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have clawed back into the playoff picture as the No. 7 seed and are coming off an impressive win over the Cardinals at home. They've now won six straight and are on the heels of the Jaguars in the AFC South, so there is room for this climb to go even higher.\nIn the huntThe Colts (8-6) are mathematically still in the hunt, but have a difficult road forward, especially after being unable to pull off the upset in Seattle. The team that may have the best chance of this group to make the postseason is the Ravens (7-7), especially after shutting out the Bengals to move back to .500 on the year. That has them right behind the Steelers (who play on Monday) in the AFC North with one more head-to-head still to go in the regular-season finale.Surprisingly, the Dolphins (6-7) are still lurking on the outskirts after winning four straight games, but a lot needs to go right. On top of likely needing to win out, Miami would need some wild card contenders to collapse, as it currently loses head-to-head tiebreakers to the Colts, Chargers and Ravens. \n\n        \n            \n                Predicting the entire 2025 NFL playoff bracket and Super Bowl winner as we enter Week 15\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNFC standingsx-Los Angeles Rams (11-3)Chicago Bears (10-4)Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)Seattle Seahawks (11-3)San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)x-clinched playoff berth  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (11-3)Remaining schedule: at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams have officially clinched a playoff berth after taking down the Detroit Lions in Week 15. Not only did they punch their ticket to the postseason, but this win helped L.A. keep both the Seahawks and 49ers at arm's length as both NFC West rivals are hot on their heels. Next week's matchup against Seattle will prove to be monumental in securing the division. Right now, however, Sean McVay and Co. are in the driver's seat for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (10-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears have notched double-digit wins on the season after soundly taking down the Cleveland Browns at Soldier Field. Thanks to the Denver Broncos defeating the Packers, Chicago has vaulted back up to first place in the NFC North and are currently the No. 2 seed in the conference. Of course, this puts even more emphasis on what was already a massive matchup with Green Bay next week. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (9-5)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, at Bills, vs. CommandersPhiladelphia snapped a three-game losing streak on Sunday with a blowout win against the Raiders. Jalen Hurts bounced back nicely with three passing touchdowns, and the victory helps the Eagles hold firm atop the NFC East. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-7)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersEven after that demoralizing loss to the Falcons on Thursday, the Buccaneers come out of Week 15 in first place in the NFC South. That's thanks to the New Orleans Saints upsetting the Carolina Panthers to push them to 7-7 on the season. Tampa Bay holds the tiebreaker over Carolina at the moment due to a better win percentage against common opponents. However, both head-to-head matchups are still on deck, which will kick off next week in Carolina. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (11-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle barely escaped Week 15 with a win. The club let Philip Rivers hang around just long enough to put the Colts within range of an upset, but a game-winning field goal drive with 18 seconds left in regulation helped secure the win. The Seahawks are now 11-3, which has then neck-and-neck with the Rams for first place in the NFC West. L.A. currently holds the tiebreaker due to a head-to-head win back in Week 11, but these two will square off on Thursday.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe Niners are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race. Despite being the No. 6 seed, San Francisco is 10-4 and ready to pounce if their division rivals slip up down the stretch. The team split the head-to-head series with the Rams, but does currently have the advantage over Seattle, which the 49ers face again in Week 18. \nThere's a world where the 49ers could surprisingly jump much higher in the standings if certain pieces fall their way over the next three weeks. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-4-1)Remaining schedule: at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay saw a considerable fall from grace. After coming into Week 15 as the No. 2 seed and in first place in the NFC North, they've suddenly dropped all the way to the No. 7 seed after falling to the Denver Broncos. That defeat helped Chicago move on top of the Packers for first place in the division, which puts an even greater emphasis on next week's matchup. Even worse, pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss due to a serious knee injury. Because Green Bay swept the season series over the Lions, the Packers have some wiggle room to play with before falling out of the playoff picture entirely. \nIn the huntThe Lions (8-6) have their backs against the wall a bit after falling to the Los Angeles Rams. That defeat continues to keep them on the outside looking in on the playoff picture as the No. 8 seed as they are in third place in the NFC North. They aren't out of the race quite yet, but they certainly need to win out and get some help along the way. The Carolina Panthers (7-7) had a golden opportunity to create some space between them and the Buccaneers for first place in the NFC South, simply needing a win over the Saints to move to 8-6, while Tampa Bay stumbled to 7-7 with a loss to Atlanta on Thursday. However, the Panthers allowed New Orleans to pull off the upset, which sent them back to .500 on the season. Because they're knotted with Bucs, they lose the tiebreaker due to an inferior record against common opponents. Of course, the Panthers can get back into it with two of their remaining three games on the season against Tampa.  The Cowboys (6-7-1) are on life support after losing to the Vikings on Sunday night, all but ending any hopes of securing a postseason berth. \n            ",

Results have been solid in recent weeks, and it seems like the players are finally adapting to manager Ruben Amorim's system.They're building momentum, and they look capable of beating Bournemouth. The Cherries have zero wins, two draws and four defeats from their last six games, which is concerning.Defensive issues derail Bournemouth's seasonManchester United are winless in their last four games against Bournemouth. They lost 3-0 at home to the Cherries last season, and the teams then played out a 1-1 draw at the Vitality Stadium in April.Bournemouth have actually won their last two matches at Old Trafford by a 3-0 scoreline, which should give the players confidence. However, their away form is poor this season.Andoni Iraola's men have picked up just one win, two draws and four defeats from seven games on the road. They've scored 11 goals on their travels, but they've also conceded 19 times.Bournemouth's defense was decimated in the summer. Milos Kerkez joined Liverpool, Ilya Zabarnyi moved to PSG, Dean Huijsen moved to Real Madrid and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga also left the club.Those departures have taken their toll, and Bournemouth have conceded a lot of goals this season. They've only kept one clean sheet in seven away games, which doesn't bode well for their chances of containing Man U's expensively assembled forwards on Monday.The Cherries still look strong in attack, with Antoine Semenyo and Junior Kroupi leading the charge. They've scored in six out of seven away games, and they should find the back of the net at Old Trafford.Bet Manchester United vs. Bournemouth at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first bet wins:Fernandes leads Man United's resurgenceManchester United are currently enjoying their strongest run of results since Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as manager last year. The Red Devils have secured four wins, three draws and just one defeat from their last eight league games.Bruno Fernandes has been at the heart of their resurgence. The Manchester United captain has four goals and six assists in 15 games this season, and he scored twice in the 4-1 win against Wolves last time out.Mason Mount also looks back to his best, while striker Matheus Cunha always looks dangerous in attack. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo may miss this game, as they're due to play at the Africa Cup of Nations soon, but United should still have enough firepower to exploit Bournemouth's defensive frailties.It could be a tight game between two evenly matched teams, but home advantage may ultimately sway this one in Manchester United's favor.Bet Man U vs. Bournemouth at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Disappointed after finishing runner-up in final Heisman voting, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia blasted those whose final ballots did not include him ahead of Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza. Pavia re-posted an image from comedian Theo Von on Instagram showing himself with family and friends on the red carpet with the caption, \"F-ALL THE VOTERS, BUT ... FAMILY FOR LIFE\" with a thumbs down emoji.Following a landslide of negative reaction from Pavia's post, the SEC Player of the Year published a lengthy apology.\"Being a part of the Heisman ceremony last night as a finalist was such an honor,\" Pavia wrote Sunday. \"As a competitor, just like in everything I do I wanted to win. To be so close to my dream and come up short was painful. I didn't handle those emotions well at all and did not represent myself the way I wanted to. I have much love and respect for the Heisman voters and the selection process, and I apologize for being disrespectful. It was a mistake, and I am sorry. \"Fernando Mendoza is an elite competitor and a deserving winner of the award. I have nothing but respect for his accomplishments as well as the success that Jeremiyah and Julian had this season.  I've been doubted my whole life. Every step of my journey I've had to break down doors and fight for myself, because Ive learned that nothing would be handed to me. My family has always been in my corner, and my teammates, coaches and staff have my six. I love them — I am grateful for them. — and I wouldn't want anything to distract from that. I look forward to competing in front of my family and with my team one more time in the ReliaQuest Bowl.\"Pavia's bitter response tarnished Vanderbilt's moment in the prestigious spotlight following the program's historic 10-win season and first appearance in New York with a Heisman finalist. Mendoza won the award by a health margin, earning 2,362 total points (643 first-place votes) to Pavia's 1,435 points (189 first-place votes).\nPavia threw for 3,192 yards with 27 touchdowns to eight interceptions this season along with 826 yards rushing and nine touchdowns. Pavia's rise to stardom included an upset win over then top-ranked Alabama in 2024, which marked Vanderbilt's first win over a top-five opponent.Pavia's play on the field drew as much attention as his personality off of it as Pavia became the center of attention. With a self-confidence level that borders on arrogance, Pavia considers himself one of the best college football players of all-time but doesn't want his opinion to be confused with conceit.\"I feel like I get the perspective that maybe I'm cocky or whatever,\" Pavia said before the Heisman ceremony. \"But I feel like I'm just a confident person. I believe in my team. I believe in the people around me, and I don't want it to come off as cocky or arrogant. I just think of that as myself.\" \nPavia's rise came from humble beginnings as a former three-star transfer from New Mexico State who signed with Vanderbilt in January 2024.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        College Football Playoff contenders such as Ohio State, Georgia, Alabama, Texas A&M and Notre Dame are all gigantic favorites against overmatched opponents during the Week 13 college football schedule. Even with all those mismatches on the slate, there are still some games that are loaded with playoff implications. Perhaps the biggest is No. 7 Oregon vs. No. 15 USC (CBS/Paramount+) in what could serve as a playoff play-in game. The latest college football odds list the Ducks as 10.5-point favorites. The eighth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners are also hanging on to their playoff hopes, and they play No. 22 Missouri, who will have quarterback Beau Pribula (ankle) available. Oklahoma is -5.5 in that matchup. No. 20 Tennessee (-3.5) vs. Florida, No. 18 Michigan (-14.5)  vs. Maryland and No. 16 Georgia Tech (-2.5) vs. Pitt are among the other notable Week 13 college football lines. Before locking in any Week 13 college football picks, be sure to see the top Week 13 college football expert picks, predictions and best bets from Thomas Casale.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:A frequent guest on national radio and TV shows to discuss college sports, Casale has been sports betting -- and winning -- for more than 30 years. Now, he has turned his attention to the Week 13 college football odds and is sharing his top betting picks.

I think we will see another high-scoring game on Saturday. The issue USC faces is it struggles to stop the run. The Trojans are allowing close to 170 rushing yards in their last three games. When the Ducks are able to run the football, it sets up everything else they do offensively and lets quarterback Dante Moore make big plays down the field. If Oregon gets the running game going early on Saturday, USC's defense is in for a long day.\"On the other side, USC is the most explosive offense the Ducks have faced, including Indiana. The Trojans have a little more speed at receiver than the Hoosiers. While Oregon has a really good front seven on defense, the Hoosiers put up 30 points on them. That was really the only good offense Oregon has faced all season, so the Ducks'' defensive stats could be a little overrated.\" See what other college football picks Casale likes at SportsLine, and bet that line right here:How to make Week 13 college football picks Casale has found two other college football picks he loves, including backing a big underdog that \"has a chance to steal a win.\" You can only see his picks at SportsLine, and you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.What are the best bets for Week 13 of college football, and which underdog should you back? Visit SportsLine now to see Thomas Casale's college football best bets, all from a proven college football handicapper, and find out. \n            ",

The Gators haven't scored more than 24 points in any of their last five games, including being held to just seven points against Kentucky on Nov. 8. The Vols do have the No. 3 scoring offense in the nation at 40.2 ppg, but part of that is inflated by averaging 53.8 ppg in four contests against inferior non-conference opponents.

But if Cincinnati wins this weekend, the Bearcats remain alive in the Big 12 Championship Game picture to secure an automatic berth into the College Football Playoff with a Big 12 title. Cincinnati is home Saturday night, and the Bearcats are 5-1 at home this season, while averaging 37.8 ppg in those six contests. BYU is 9-1 and No. 11 in the CFP rankings, but only two of their six conference wins have come against teams with winning Big 12 records.

He had good fights, but he lost his opportunities.\" \nHooker (24-12) is executing his master plan to leapfrog other contenders in the division. Hooker campaigned for the Tsarukyan fight, believing other top contenders were avoiding him. If Hooker cashes as a major underdog, he might find himself as the top contender. That's where the shortcuts end. Hooker believes Tsarukyan is the most skilled lightweight fighter, even greater than champion Topuria. \"He had no choice but to fight me,\" Hooker told CBS Sports. \"I knew that, looking at the division. I knew no one between him and me would take the fight. It's too risky. They have a good excuse because he pulled out of his title fight in the last five minutes with a sore back. So the champ Ilia has a good excuse not to face him.\" \nSaturday's co-main event also has title implications. Former welterweight champion Belal Muhammad looks to bounce back against rising contender Ian Machado Garry. A standout performance is imperative after Michael Morales and Carlos Prates notched highlight-reel knockouts at UFC 322. Muhammad and Garry have been trading barbs in the media over how their fight, a grappler vs. striker fight on the surface, will play out.\n\"I'm going to grab hold of him, I'm going to take  him down, then I'm going to let him back up, just because I'm going to  show him, 'I could take you down if I want to.' Then I'm going to outbox  him because he said he could outstrike me...\" Muhammad told MMA Junkie. \"It's finishing  him on the feet and reminding everybody who I am.\"\"That sounds like someone who can't hold me down... If you get me down, keep me down. Try that,\" Garry told CBS Sports in response, later adding, \"I think he's chatting out of his backside. I don't believe it for a second. I think he's playing reverse psychology. If he were smart, he'd be saying this. However, I genuinely think he's thick enough to believe that.\"Elsewhere on the undercard, there are plenty of rising contenders and former title challengers. Former light heavyweight title challenger Volkan Oezdemir is back in action when he takes on veteran Alonzo Menifield. Oezdemir earned his title opportunity all the way back in 2018 and has been trying to get back there ever since. The 36-year-old fights for the first time in 2025 on Saturday after dropping a decision to Carlos Ulberg last November. Plus, former Bellator MMA and RIZIN MMA bantamweight champion Kyoji Horiguchi makes his return to UFC on Saturday when he takes on Tagir Ulanbekov at flyweight. Horiguchi is an eight-fight veteran of UFC where his lone defeat came at the hands of former champion Demetrious Johnson. But now he returns for his first fight under the UFC banner in nearly a decade when he takes on the durable Ulanbekov, who has won four straight.\nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings Sportsbook before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassArman Tsarukyan -650Dan Hooker +470LightweightIan Machado Garry -270Belal Muhammad+220WelterweightVolkan Oezdemir -225Alonzo Menifield +185Light heavyweightMyktybek Orolbai -250Jack Hermansson +205WelterweightWaldo Cortes Acosta -135Shamil Gaziev +114HeavyweightTagir Ulanbekov -218Kyoji Horiguchi +180FlyweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Nov. 22 | Start time: 1 p.m. ET (main card)Location: Doha, QatarStream: ESPN+PredictionArman Tsarukyan vs. Dan Hooker: Hooker winning would mark one of the best career comebacks in UFC history and thrust him into a high-profile fight with Topuria. I fear, however, it's an outcome reserved for fairytales. Tsarukyan is a nightmare for any lightweight. Tsarukyan is arguably the top lightweight wrestler after Makhachev's welterweight graduation. Hooker has great takedown defense, but Mateusz Gamrot managed to score five takedowns against him. Tsarukyan is almost as potent a takedown artist as Gamrot, with better top control. While it'd be irresponsible for Tsarukyan to kickbox with Hooker, his evolving striking and solid chin create opportunities to initiate takedowns. Hooker can drag people through hell, but Tsarukyan's well-roundedness allows him to put the fight in his wheelhouse. Pick: Tsarukyan via submission\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A Virginia judge on Friday handed down five life sentences to former University of Virginia student Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., closing a wrenching week of testimony nearly two years after a shooting that devastated the Cavaliers' football program and the broader campus community.Jones, 26, received a life term for each of the three players he killed -- Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr. and D'Sean Perry -- as well as for two surviving victims, running back Mike Hollins and student Marlee Morgan. Additional firearm convictions added more than two decades to the punishment. The sentence followed Jones' guilty plea last November to first-degree murder, aggravated malicious wounding and related gun charges.Judge Cheryl Higgins delivered the decision after five days of emotional testimony from witnesses, investigators and family members of the victims. Higgins criticized the nature of the attack, noting the lack of evidence that Jones had been threatened before opening fire, and described the shootings as execution-style. The attack occurred Nov. 13, 2022 aboard a charter bus returning from a class trip to Washington, D.C.The courtroom was packed throughout the proceedings with relatives and friends of the victims reacting audibly as each count was read. On Friday, before sentencing, Jones addressed the court for the first time. He apologized tearfully for the harm he caused to \"everyone on that bus,\" though some families walked out during his remarks, according to CVille Right Now.\nDuring the week, prosecutors outlined a chilling sequence that began when the bus parked in a campus garage around 10:15 p.m. Witnesses recalled a chaotic and terrifying scene as shots rang out, killing three members of the football program and wounding Hollins and Morgan. Both survivors later returned to UVA athletics -- Morgan joining the track team and Hollins returning to the field in 2023, where he received multiple courage awards for his comeback.Jones' defense team called relatives, mentors and an expert forensic psychologist in an effort to lessen the punishment. They argued Jones suffered physical and emotional abuse growing up, leaving him with deep trauma and what they described as \"delusional\" thinking. But after a contentious cross-examination -- and questions from the judge -- those arguments failed to move the court.\nJones had briefly been a walk-on player at Virginia in 2018 before leaving the program while remaining enrolled. His guilty plea last year removed the possibility of aggravated murder convictions but still exposed him to multiple life terms -- a sentence Higgins ultimately imposed.\n            ",

Aiyuk was expected to return to the field at some point this season after recovering from a devastating knee injury suffered last year, but as the season starts to wind down, things have only gotten more murky.According to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones, San Francisco voided Aiyuk's guaranteed money for the 2026 season during training camp for not meeting the requirements of his contract extensions signed in August 2024, worth $120 million over four years. Aiyuk's contract included an option bonus worth $24.935 million, which originally became guaranteed on April 1, but is now void. It's unclear if the 49ers will pay his $1.215 million base salary and bonuses for workouts and per-game appearances. Aiyuk has been missing from the gridiron since suffering a right knee injury in October 2024. He tore his ACL, MCL and meniscus against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 last season. The team had initially hoped to get him back to practice around midseason. however, the clock is winding down with six regular-season games left.\n\"Brandon's just  week-to-week,\" Niners coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday. \"When he had such a big  injury like that,  just waiting until he is fully comfortable to come up  and start  practicing.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A big fight card goes down on Saturday, with four world title bouts anchoring the action from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In the headliner, WBC light heavyweight champion David Benavidez will put his title on the line against Anthony Yarde. Benavidez moved up in weight after failed attempts to lure former undisputed super middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez into an epic showdown. He's fought twice since moving up to 175 pounds, outlasting Oleksandr Gvozdyk by decision and then battering David Morrell over 12 rounds in February.Bet Night of Champions at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:\"I've had my eye on Anthony Yarde for a long time. I know he's a great fighter. He has a lot of heart, he has a lot of power, and the thing I like about him is no matter who he's up against, he's in there to make it a great fight,\" Benavidez said at the final press conference this week. \"Me, I like to make every fight like I'm in a war. I like to give the people the fights they want to see. I had a great training camp. I've trained extremely hard and you know this fight is going to live up to the moment. Anthony Yarde, he's trying to capture a world title. I'm trying to capture all the titles and unify all the titles in the light heavyweight division so there's a lot at stake here.\"The other three championship bouts set for the event are WBO welterweight champion Brian Norman Jr. against Devin Haney, WBC and WBO junior bantamweight champion Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez battling WBA champ Fernando Martinez in a three-belt unification bout, and Abdullah Mason facing Sam Noakes for the vacant WBO lightweight championship.\nThere are plenty of intriguing storylines running through the card, so let's take a look at the odds and break down all four world title fights.David Benavidez vs. Anthony Yarde fight card, oddsOdds via FanDuel SportsbookDavid Benavidez (c) -1200 vs. Anthony Yarde +680, WBC light heavyweight titleBrian Norman Jr. (c) -112 vs. Devin Haney -112, WBO welterweight titleJesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez (c) -1200 vs. Fernando Martinez (c) +670, unified junior bantamweight titleAbdullah Mason -430 vs. Sam Noakes +300, vacant WBO lightweight titleAbdullah Mason vs. Sam NoakesThe 21-year-old Mason (19-0, 17 KO) has been a hot prospect since turning professional in 2021. He has been on the standard prospect track of facing lower-level talent before slowly moving up to more difficult challenges. In his most recent fight, Mason faced the most dangerous test of his career, taking on Jeremia Nakathila. Nakathila was unable to continue after the fourth round as Mason cruised again.In Noakes (17-0, 15 KO), Mason is facing another up-and-comer, though one seven years his senior. Noakes' career has been very similar to Mason's, with a comparable stoppage rate and journey from facing lower-level talent to a few wins over veterans such as Yvan Mendy and Ryan Walsh.\nMason is someone who feels as though he has the makings of a special fighter, while Noakes feels like he tops out at being a very good one. That said, neither fighter has faced much resistance in their careers; in their four combined fights that went to decision, they lost a total of two rounds. This has the potential to be a very good fight that teaches plenty about both fighters. Pick: Abdullah Mason via UD (+220)Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez vs. Fernando MartinezRodriguez (22-0, 15 KO) had a breakthrough 2022, when he accepted a fight with Carlos Cuadras for the WBC super flyweight championship on one week's notice. Jumping up a weight class on short notice, Rodriguez won the title and defended it twice against Srisaket Sor Rungvisai and Israel Gonzalez before returning to flyweight. At flyweight, Rodriguez won two titles before returning to super flyweight, where he has continued piling up impressive victories while becoming a unified champion once again -- and grabbing the No. 5 spot in the CBS Sports pound-for-pound rankings.Martinez (18-0, 9 KO) is a fighter who thrives on aggression. He won the IBF title by beating Jerwin Ancajas in 2022. After winning the belt, Martinez successfully defended in a rematch before beating Jade Bornea and Kazuto Ioka (twice). The fight has been targeted for a while, and now the two best fighters at 115 pounds are set to mix it up.\nRodriguez is a brilliant tactical fighter who unleashes combinations as well as anyone in the game. Martinez will have to figure out a way for his aggression to nullify Rodriguez's footwork and force the issue in exchanges. That's a big ask, though. Regardless, this has all the makings of one of the best fights of the year. Pick: Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez via UD (+290)Brian Norman Jr. vs. Devin HaneyHaney (32-0, 15 KO) comes into the fight as the bigger name. As the former undisputed lightweight champion, Haney has been in some huge fights in his career. As important as undisputed title fights against George Kambosos Jr. and Vasiliy Lomachenko were, the fight most people remember for Haney is the thumping he received from Ryan Garcia in April 2024. Haney was dropped by Garcia three times in a fight that came as Garcia appeared to be spiraling in a mental health crisis. Garcia, who also missed weight, failed drug tests, leading to a no-contest. By that technicality, Haney is still undefeated, but he looked very gunshy against Jose Ramirez in a terrible fight in May.Norman (28-0, 22 KO) packs plenty of power, and if Haney is still as worried about getting hit as he appeared to be against Ramirez, this could be a long night for him. Norman is on a career best run over his past three fights, winning the interim WBO welterweight belt by knocking out Giovani Santillan and being promoted to full champion when Terence Crawford vacated the belt to move up in weight. As champ, Norman has knocked out Derrieck Cuevas and Jin Sasaki.\nHaney opened the fight as a near -145 favorite but now sits at a slight -112 underdog to Norman's -120. It's hard to erase the image of Haney repeatedly crumbling when hit by Garcia's left hooks and the almost complete inability to get out of neutral against Ramirez in one of the worst fights you'll ever see. For those reasons, it's not difficult to see Norman scoring the biggest win of his career on Saturday. Pick: Brian Norman Jr. via TKO9 (+210)David Benavidez vs. Anthony YardeBoth main event fighters have promised a shootout. Benavidez told DAZN that he's happy to meet in a fan-friendly fight.\n\"I watched his fights,\" Benavidez said. \"He likes to go forward, he likes to press the action, he likes to look for the knockout, so I'm the same way. So I think at the end of the day it's going to be both egos going at each other -- who's going to back up? It's not going to be me. It's probably not going to be him, either.  \"When we're ready to go to war the people are going to see a great war, and that's what we're here for, to give the fans what they want to see.\"\nBenavidez (30-0, 24 KO) is now fully established at light heavyweight, a division he moved to when it was clear Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez was never going to meet him in the ring. Benavidez took an at times ugly win over Oleksandr Gvozdyk to win the WBC interim title and then defended that belt with a big win over fellow former super middleweight David Morrell. Now, having been promoted to full champion, Benavidez looks to make his first defense against Yarde.Yarde (27-3, 24 KO) has twice challenged for light heavyweight world titles, losing to Sergey Kovalev in 2019 and Artur Beterbiev in 2023. In his losses to Kovalev and Lyndon Arthur, Yarde picked up a reputation as someone who was missing the ability to dig deep and a willingness to walk through fire when things got difficult. While Yarde was stopped by Beterbiev in the eighth round of their fight, he shook some of those labels by returning fire and digging deep to give Beterbiev a very difficult fight.Benavidez is the better fighter heading into this one, but his power has yet to fully translate to 175 pounds. The Yarde who showed up against Beterbiev could pull off a massive upset. That result does feel unlikely, though. Pick: David Benavidez via UD (+185)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL Week 12 matchup on 'Sunday Night Football' pits NFC contenders as the Los Angeles Rams host the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Rams (8-2) are tied with Philadelphia for the best record in the conference and are riding a five-game win streak. L.A. knocked off Seattle, 21-19, in Week 11. Tampa (6-4) sits atop the NFC South but has dropped three of its last four, most recently falling to Buffalo, 44-32. The Rams have won eight of the last 10 matchups between the teams. The Bucs have ruled out Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot), while receiver Chris Godwin (fibula) is questionable. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. The Bucs won the last matchup, 16-13, back in 2022. The latest Buccaneers vs. Rams odds have Los Angeles as 6.5-point home favorites.

Despite the outcome versus Buffalo last week, Tampa did put up 32 points on the scoreboard, which is its second-most of the season, and the Buccaneers could take advantage of a slumping pass for rush the Rams. L.A. hasn't recorded a defensive sack in back-to-back games and has just one QB takedown over its last three games. Los Angeles also gave up its second-most rushing yards of the year (135) last week versus Seattle, so there are defensive holes that Tampa's top-10 scoring offense can exploit. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Rams can coverRecent spread results favor L.A. which is 4-1 ATS during its five-game win streak, while Tampa is just 1-3 ATS over its last four. Recent on the field results also tilt in favor of the Rams, who have won eight of the last 10 meetings between the teams, including in the postseason. This year, Matthew Stafford is the MVP favorite as he leads the NFL in passing touchdowns (27) for a Rams team which is well balanced on both sides of the ball. L.A. has the No. 6 scoring offense and the No. 2 scoring defense, making it one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. The Rams also boast the second-best turnover differential (+10) in the league. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Buccaneers vs. Rams picksSportsLine's model has simulated Rams vs. Bucs 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 48 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 college football schedule coincides with that annual late-season SEC slate where many of the teams face Group of Five opponents. While 14 SEC teams are in action, just four games you can make Week 13 college football picks on are conference matchups. It's highlighted by Oklahoma vs. Missouri, a top-25 matchup that has OU as a 5.5-point favorite. There's just one other ranked contest, and it has Oregon as a 10.5-point favorite over USC, according to the latest Week 13 college football odds, in a matchup of two of the top three scoring teams since 2022.Even with the lack of elite matchups, there are still several interesting games, many of them pitting bitter rivals versus one another. Among them are Tennessee vs. Florida (+3.5), UNC vs. Duke (-6.5), Texas vs. Arkansas (+8.5) and Miami vs. Virginia Tech (+17.5). It wouldn't be the worst thing to seek out some college football betting advice with something unexpected happening seemingly every Saturday. Before locking in any Week 13 college football picks, be sure to see the latest Week 13 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

The K-State defense is among the most opportunistic in the nation, with 24 takeaways on the season and five in Saturday's win over Oklahoma State. Meanwhile, Utah has just six takeaways over its last six games, and the Utes can be sloppy as times, as they've averaged seven penalties over their last four games. That contrasts with the disciplined unit that Chris Klieman leads as KSU averages the fifth-fewest penalties (3.5) in FBS. Excelling on the margins should allow the Wildcats to stay within this spread, with the model having this as a one-score game as KSU covers well over 70% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nAnother prediction: No. 15 Georgia Tech (-2.5, 60.5) covers against Pitt in almost 60% of simulations Saturday at 7 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh faced its first top-15 squad in Notre Dame on Saturday, and the Panthers were embarrassed in a 22-point defeat. Pitt couldn't stop the Irish's rushing attack, giving up a season-high of 175 yards on the ground, and now Pittsburgh has to face a Yellow Jackets rushing attack that's top 10 in FBS in both yards per game and yards per carry. Not only that, but Georgia Tech's quarterback, Haynes King, also ranks fifth in the country in completion percentage as the Yellow Jackets offense should overwhelm the Panthers. In addition to Georgia Tech covering, the sims also have the Over hitting over 50% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 13The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 13, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a pair of ranked teams outright losing to unranked foes. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which ranked squads go down?

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter, Juventus and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Lazio, Fiorentina, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.This weekend's Serie A slate features some huge battles, highlighted by AC Milan facing Inter on Sunday: Here's what to know.Leao speaks to Morning Footy Speaking to Morning Footy on CBS Sports Golazo Network, Rafael Leao spoke ahead of the Derby della Madonnina against Inter that will take place on Sunday at San Siro.\"The coach doesn't ask me many things, he just told me: 'be free,' and the most important thing is to stay focused and have the right mentality, because he knows what I can do with the ball and that I can help the team even without the ball. He's more like a father asking his son to always do better at school and in life, to do things the right way. I feel happy and very confident in every game because I know he's counting on me. He just asks me to stay focused even after a goal, to not stop.\"\nLeao is expected to start alongside USMNT Christian Pulisic in the attack for the first time since August 16, as injuries affected both players so far this season.\"To be honest, I like one-on-one situations, dribbling past one, two, or three defenders, but we know football has changed, and statistics matter too. I don't really like them. I grew up watching Robinho, Ronaldinho, Quaresma, and Cristiano, and those types of players excite me, seeing what they do on the pitch. Pulisic? \"I think he's changed. When I saw him at Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund, he was a winger who liked to dribble, one-on-one, go from one side to the other, with a lot of skill. Christian understands what I was talking about earlier about the evolution of football and statistics. He's a player with great qualities, but he's also very intelligent, and in that position, where he plays now, as a number ten, he knows how to move, and when I play with him, I try to help him and create space for him.\"\nHow to watch Inter vs. AC Milan, oddsDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: San Siro -- Milan Live stream: Paramount+Odds: Inter -109; Draw +244; AC Milan +293How to watch Serie A Matchday 12All times U.S./EasternSaturday, November 22Udinese vs. Bologna, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Cagliari vs. Genoa, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Fiorentina vs. Juventus, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Napoli vs. Atalanta, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, November 23Hellas Verona vs. Parma, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Cremonese vs. AS Roma, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Lazio vs. Lecce, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Inter vs. AC Milan, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Monday, November 24Torino vs. Como, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Sassuolo vs. Pisa, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

Man City has won four in a row and sits second behind Arsenal in the EPL standings, while Newcastle has lost three of five and sits 14th. Kickoff from St. James' Park is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. Newcastle are +260 money line underdogs in the latest BetMGM Sportsbook odds while Man City are -102 money line favorites. A draw comes in at +260 and the total sits at 2.5 (Over -150, Under +110). The SportsLine Projection Model has Manchester City winning in 46% of simulations to bring value at these odds.

He's currently leading the golden boot race in Premier League play and has already picked up 14 goals over his 11 starts for the club this season. He's already scored against the best defenses in the league, and he will be looking to return from scoring for Norway to start scoring for his club again. He's also currently one goal away from a pretty remarkable milestone. His next goal will be his 100th EPL goal, and if he scores against Newcastle, he would have accomplished that in just 109 appearances. Expect Haaland to be charging the goal for 90 minutes straight. Manchester City momentum Liverpool is crumbling right now, Arsenal are prepping for the North London Derby and Manchester City are lurking. Right before international break, Manchester City really started to turn up the gas. They wiped the floor with Liverpool 3-0, ran over Dortmund in UCL play 4-1 and outscored both Bournemouth and Swansea 3-1. This team is firing on all cylinders and the break will just have made them stronger. I know playing Newcastle at home is now joke, but City is welcoming back players from injury and should be looking to pick up right where they left off knowing Arsenal could very well drop points this weekend. \n            \n    ",

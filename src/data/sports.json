This is the rubber match between the franchises as their all-time series is tied 28-28 after the Rams won their Week 11 matchup. Seattle (11-3) is coming off an 18-16 victory over Indianapolis on Sunday, marking the team's fourth straight victory. L.A. has won two in a row, most recently defeating Detroit, 41-34, in Week 15, which clinched a playoff berth for the Rams. Seattle would lock up a postseason spot with a victory. OL Charles Cross (hamstring) is out for Seattle. DL Braden Fiske (ankle) is active for Los Angeles, but WR Davante Adams (hamstring) is inactive. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in Seattle. L.A. has won four of the last five overall matchups, as well as four of the last five meetings in Seattle. The latest Seahawks vs. Rams odds have Seattle as 1.5-point home favorites, while the over/under for total points is 42.5, a 4-point drop from opening at 46.5 as both heavy rain and winds are expected at kickoff. Both teams are 10-4 against the spread this season. Before making any Rams vs. Seahawks picks, make sure to check out the 'Thursday Night Football' predictions from SportsLine NFL expert Larry Hartstein.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Matthew Stafford going Over 230.5 passing yards yards. Bet it at DraftKings right here:\nA former lead writer for Covers and The Linemakers, Hartstein combines a vast network of Vegas sources with an analytical approach he honed while working for Pro Football Focus. Hartstein tied for 52nd place (out of 1,598 entries) in the 2022 Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest, going 53-34-3 ATS. He is coming off a down 2024 NFL season at SportsLine that puts him at 967-821 all-time on NFL sides and props (plus 13.8 units), including 593-518 ATS. Entering the 2025-26 season, he has been profitable in five of six seasons, going 659-564 ATS (plus $3,556 for $100 players).In addition, Hartstein has gone 27-10-1 on his last 38 picks involving the Rams, returning $1,601.

They have won seven of the last 10 games, while covering in eight of those contests. The Rams defense flustered Sam Darnold into four interceptions in Los Angeles' Week 11 win, which is Darnold's most picks since his infamous \"seeing ghosts\" game in 2019. While both teams rank in the top five in both scoring offense and scoring defense, the biggest difference between the two lies in giveaways and takeaways. Los Angeles' +9 turnover differential ranks in the top five of the NFL, while Seattle has a -1 mark as it's committed the second-most turnovers (23) in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine, and bet Darnold to go Over 0.5 passing interceptions at DraftKings here:\nWhy the Seahawks can coverA major component of L.A.'s offense is out in Davante Adams (hamstring), who leads the league in receiving touchdowns. That will make things easier for an already elite defense, as Seattle is No. 2 in points allowed and allows the fewest yards per pass attempt and second-fewest yards per rush attempt. The Seahawks are equally as potent through the air on offense as they are in defending the pass on defense, as Seattle leads the NFL in yards per pass attempt. Thus, it connects on big passing plays like no other team, and the Rams' defense is exploitable in that area. L.A. just allowed its second-most passing yards (326) of the season in Week 15, while the Rams gave up their most points of the year (34) in that contest. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks picksHartstein has analyzed Seahawks vs. Rams from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

    "body": "\n        The Ohio Bobcats fired first-year coach Brian Smith for cause, the program announced Wednesday after earlier this month placing him on leave for an \"undetermined period of time\" and naming defensive coordinator John Hauser as interim coach. Ohio University previously did not disclose details as to why it placed Smith on leave, and after his firing, it cited \"serious professional misconduct\" without specifying the exact behavior that led to his ouster. The intent to terminate letter, however, outlines Smith's alleged \"extramarital affairs\" -- including one with a graduate student -- and accused him of consuming alcohol on the job.University president Lori Stewart Gonzalez said in the letter that Smith brought \"disrepute, scandal and ridicule\" to the school for carrying on an affair at the Ohio University Inn. Gonzalez also said that the school was aware of Smith's consuming of alcohol in his office as well as his smelling strongly of alcohol and appearing intoxicated at a public appearance.\"The termination follows an administrative review of allegations that Smith violated the terms of his employment agreement by engaging in serious professional misconduct and participating in activities that reflect unfavorably on the University,\" the school said in a statement.Hauser will coach the Bobcats in their bowl game against UNLV on Dec. 23 and run the program until a new hire is made.\nSmith's attorney, Rex Elliott, disputes Ohio's reasoning for the dismissal.\"We vigorously dispute Ohio University's grounds for the termination for cause of Coach Brian Smith,\" Elliott said in a statement provided to CBS Sports' Richard Johnson. \"He is shocked and dismayed by this turn of events, and we plan to fight this wrongful termination to protect his good name. Coach Smith is an ethical man who has done an exemplary job for the University. He wants nothing but the best for the players, coaches, and the entire Bobcat community.\"Smith was named the interim coach last year when Tim Albin left to take the Charlotte job. Albin led Ohio to its first Mid-American Conference title since 1968 but departed prior to the Cure Bowl. Smith then was promoted to full-time head coach. Before arriving at Ohio in 2022, Smith was the offensive coordinator at Hawaii, his alma mater, and Washington State. \nHauser has spent most of his career coaching in the MAC, with time at Northern Illinois and Miami (OH) before joining the Bobcats' staff in 2022. He's risen from safeties coach to defensive coordinator and associate head coach, and now gets a crack at the interim head coaching position. \n            ",

    "body": "\nIt would be nearly impossible for the San Francisco 49ers to miss the playoffs at this point in the 2025 NFL season. The same was being said about the Indianapolis Colts eight weeks into the campaign, but here we are.The Colts were sitting pretty in the postseason picture after winning seven of their first eight games, but the wheels have fallen off the wagon since then and their playoff hopes have significantly diminished. Indianapolis will find itself in an almost must-win situation when it hosts San Francisco at Lucas Oil Stadium in Week 16 at 8:15 p.m. on Monday Night Football.The 49ers (10-4) could have their ticket to the postseason already punched by the time they take the field, as they would secure a berth if the Detroit Lions lose to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. Should Detroit win that contest, San Francisco could earn a playoff spot by defeating Indianapolis.Things are much convoluted for the Colts, who have lost four consecutive games, five of their last six and their starting quarterback for the year. Already playing with a fractured left fibula, Daniel Jones -- who was having an impressive comeback season -- suffered a torn right Achilles tendon in the team's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 14, ending his campaign.Backup Riley Leonard replaced Jones in that contest and injured his knee, leaving Indianapolis scrambling ahead of its Week 15 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. With 2023 fourth overall draft pick Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve with a fractured orbital bone, the Colts coaxed Philip Rivers out of retirement and fed him to the wolves, AKA Seattle's top-five defense.Indianapolis' offense registered just 220 total yards and the 44-year-old Rivers, who last played in the NFL with the Colts in 2020, completed 18-of-27 pass attempts for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The eight-time Pro Bowler still had the team in position to win as it took a one-point lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter, but Seattle's Jason Myers set a franchise record with his sixth field goal of the game with 18 seconds remaining and the Seahawks held on for an 18-16 triumph.\nThe loss kept the Colts in third place in the AFC South and dropped them to eighth in the conference standings. Despite their recent misfortunes, there's a possibility they enter Monday night with their postseason destiny in their own hands.On Sunday, the AFC South-leading Jaguars visit the conference-best Denver Broncos, the Los Angeles Chargers take on the Cowboys in Dallas and the division-rival Houston Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders. If either Jacksonville, Los Angeles or Houston loses, Indianapolis could soar right into the playoffs by winning its final three games.SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes that even with a loss in Week 16, San Francisco is a virtual lock for the postseason, even if passing the Los Angeles Rams and Seahawks to win the NFC West title is far-fetched. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the 49ers currently have more than a 96% chance to make the playoffs, and they would drop by less than 3% should they fall to the Colts.The model says Indianapolis' prospects for a postseason berth are less than 14% entering Monday's contest and fall below 6% with a setback against San Francisco.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCESan Francisco 49ers96.7%100.0%94.0%6.0%Indianapolis Colts13.7%29.8%5.8%24.0%CHANCES OF WINNING NFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCESan Francisco 49ers12.6%20.0%2.4%17.6%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC SOUTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCEIndianapolis Colts1.7%2.2%1.3%0.9%The road ahead certainly is a tough one for the Colts, and even though they won't be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss on Monday, it will make qualifying even more difficult. But if they receive help from just one of the three aforementioned teams on Sunday, their only concern will be posting victories against the 49ers, Jaguars and Texans in their final three games.Indianapolis owns a 27-19 record in the all-time series against San Francisco and has won each of the last five meetings, including a 30-18 triumph in 2021. Jonathan Taylor, who leads the NFL in rushing with 1,443 yards, ran for 107 and a touchdown in that contest while receiver Michael Pittman Jr. made four catches for 105 yards and a TD.San Francisco is a 5.5-point favorite against Indianapolis in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings. The ITL team's model is predicting a 28-24 triumph by the 49ers, which would give them a playoff berth if one wasn't already secured by a Detroit loss on Sunday and put an enormous damper on the Colts' postseason hopes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Women's National Basketball Players Association announced Thursday that the union has authorized the executive committee to \"call a strike when necessary\" as players continue negotiations with the league over a new collective bargaining agreement. It is vital to note that the players are not going on strike right now. Rather, this vote signifies that a majority of the players are willing to go on strike. Per the WNBPA, 93% of eligible players participated in the vote and 98% of the votes were in favor of authorizing a strike if necessary. The historic vote is the latest escalation of the labor battle between the players and the league, which has been raging for over a year. The WNBA has never seen a work stoppage of any kind -- neither a strike nor a lockout -- and has never missed games due to labor strife. Here is the WNBPA's full statement:\"The players have spoken. Through a decisive vote with historic participation, our membership has authorized the WNBPA's Executive Committee to call a strike when necessary. The players' decision is an unavoidable response to the state of negotiations with the WNBA and its teams. Time and again, the players' thoughtful and reasonable approach has been met by the WNBA and its teams with a resistance to change and a recommitment to the draconian provisions that have unfairly restricted players for nearly three decades. The players' vote is neither a call for an immediate strike nor an intention to pursue one. Rather, it is an emphatic affirmation of the players' confidence in their leadership and their unwavering solidarity against ongoing efforts to divide, conquer, and undervalue them. Let it be known. The players remain united, resolute, and prepared to fight for their value and their future.\"The WNBA issued its own statement later on Thursday, which stated that the WNBPA's statement \"fundamentally misrepresents the ongoing discussions.\" Additionally, the WNBA's statement indicated that it has made a new offer that includes an \"uncapped revenue-sharing model.\"Here is the WNBA's full statement:\"We are aware that the players have voted to authorize the WNBPA Executive Committee to call a strike if the Executive Committee decides to take that step in the future. While we acknowledge the players' right to authorize a future work stoppage, we strongly disagree with the WNBPA's characterization of the current state of negotiations, which fundamentally misrepresents the ongoing discussions taking place at the bargaining table. \"It is difficult to understand claims that the league is resistant to change, particularly given that we are proposing numerous CBA modifications including significant immediate salary increases and a new uncapped revenue-sharing model that would ensure continued salary growth tied to revenue growth.\"The league remains steadfast in its commitment to reaching an agreement as soon as possible and delivering a 30th season for the players, fans, teams, and partners. We have negotiated in good faith and with urgency, and remain focused on finalizing a new collective bargaining agreement that not only meaningfully enhances player pay, benefits, and experience, but also does so in a way that ensures the long-term growth of the game and the league's capacity to serve the next generation of WNBA players.\"The current CBA was originally set to expire on Oct. 31, following the conclusion of the 2025 WNBA season, but the two sides have since agreed to multiple extensions to continue talks. The first, a 30-day extension, pushed the deadline back to Nov. 30. When it was clear there was still no deal on sight, they agreed to a 40-day extension that made Jan. 9, 2026, the new deadline. \n        \n            \n                The WNBA is undermining its own product again, but a perception-altering CBA is still within reach\n                \n                    Lindsay Gibbs                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere has been movement since the latest extension was announced, but the two sides remain far apart, which WNBPA vice president Kelsey Plum said last week at Team USA training camp is \"a little bit disheartening.\" \nThe league made a proposal at the beginning of the month offering significant pay raises, including a max salary of over $1 million, an average salary above $500,000 and a minimum salary above $225,000. The league's offer also included a revenue sharing mechanism, though it's unclear exactly how that would work. At the same time, the league also proposed starting training camp in mid-March and eliminating housing benefits, neither of which pleased the players. The WNBPA countered with an offer that would see players earn \"roughly 30% of total league and team revenue,\" per The Athletic. Under the WNBA's latest offer, the players would receive less than 15%. Additionally, the WNBPA proposed mandating teams to carry 12 players at all times (some only roster 11 to save money) and the creation of two developmental player slots. The WNBA's statement on Thursday indicates that the league has since made an improved offer, though the details are unclear. \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA talks: How WNBPA's proposal to create developmental roster spots would benefit players and teams\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile there is still time to get a deal done and ensure the 2026 season starts on time, the offseason has already been disrupted. The Golden State Valkyries held their expansion draft on Dec. 6 last year. The Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, the two expansion teams joining in 2026, must wait for a new CBA to be ratified to learn when their draft will take place. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this week that he would join the WNBA CBA negotiations if necessary. \"We're available to do whatever is necessary to help get a deal done,\" Silver said during his NBA Cup press conference. \"I'm encouraged by the fact they extended the deadline once again in to January. Presumably the sides wouldn't have been willing to do that unless they thought there was a constructive path to getting a deal done.\"\n        \n            \n                Caitlin Clark urges compromise in WNBA CBA negotiations: 'We need to play basketball'\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt Team USA camp, Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark urged compromise, but said the players will \"fight for everything we deserve.\"\n\"This is the biggest moment the WNBA has ever seen. It's not something that can be messed up,\" Clark said. \"We're going to fight for everything we deserve, but at the same time we need to play basketball. That's what our fans crave and that's what all of you crave as well. You want the product on the floor. At the end of the day that's how you make the money, that's how you're marketable, that's what the fans get excited about, that's what the fans want to show up for. \"It's business and it's a negotiation and there has to be compromise on both sides. We're starting to get down to the wire of it, and it's become really important. Obviously, I want to help in any way I can, and I've tried to educate myself the best I can. And obviously, I can't speak to every single number, it's pretty complicated, but I think there are different things that we can find ways to say, 'no, we certainly deserve that and we're not going to compromise on that,' and then other things that we can probably compromise on.\"\n            ",

Dennis Dutton, his son Jack and Craig Wadsworth also died in the crash.The plane, which crashed during a landing at approximately 10:15 a.m., was registered to a company that Biffle owned.Flight tracking data shows the plane took off from the airport around 10 a.m. but returned and attempted to land at the Charlotte-area airport. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed that six people were aboard the Cessna C550 and that there were fatalities associated with the crash.\"NASCAR is devastated by the tragic loss of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, son Ryder, Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton in a fatal plane crash,\" NASCAR said in a statement. \"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many. His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.\"On the track, Greg's talent and tenacity earned him championships in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series, as well as numerous wins and accolades in the NASCAR Cup Series. Beyond his racing career, he gave of himself for the betterment of our community. Most notably, Greg spent countless hours of his time helping the citizens of North Carolina during the disasters that followed Hurricane Helene. His tireless work saved lives. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to Greg's entire family, friends, and all who were touched by his life.\"In the years following his exit from racing, Biffle was involved in humanitarian efforts in North Carolina and headlined the many NASCAR figures to assist in 2024 with Hurricane Helene recovery. Biffle flew a private helicopter into the affected region of Western North Carolina to deliver supplies and internet service to those stranded.\"It's heartbreaking,\" North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a press conference. \"Just heartbreaking. I just learned about it 20-30 minutes ago. I don't know that we know the number of casualties. Obviously a number of people were impacted. Our hearts go out to those families. No more tragic way to walk into the holiday season.\"Biffle, 55, drove in 515 races over a 16-year NASCAR Cup Series career. He racked up 19 wins and 175 top-10 finishes. He competed numerous times for the Cup Series championship. His best series finish came in 2005 when he finished second behind Tony Stewart.Biffle won numerous awards throughout his prolific career and in 2023 was named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest Drivers. He won the 2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and the 2002 NASCAR Busch Series. He was the first of only three drivers to win both competitions. He was also one of 36 drivers to win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series.\n            ",

At the start of the season, five ACC teams were ranked in the AP Top 25, with Duke and NC State leading the way at No. 7 and No. 9, respectively. Seven weeks later, both Duke and N.C. State have fallen completely out of the Top 25 and only three ACC teams remain: Louisville at No. 16, North Carolina at No. 18 and Notre Dame at No. 19.Yes, that would be the Louisville Cardinals sitting at the top of the ACC almost two months into the season.It's not exactly a surprise that Louisville is in the mix -- as head coach Jeff Walz is quick to remind everyone, Louisville was first in the ACC from 2017-2021 and from 2017-2023, the Cardinals made five straight Elite Eights and two Final Fours. But the last two seasons have been comparatively down years -- the Cardinals finished fifth in the ACC in 2024 and fourth in 2025, and had two consecutive first-weekend losses in the NCAA tournament. Perhaps that explains why they were ranked fourth in the ACC preseason poll.Louisville is 10-3 on the season, but all three of their losses came against quality opponents – No. 1 UConn on opening day, No. 20 Kentucky in an in-state rivalry game and No. 3 South Carolina. The Cardinals turned a lot of heads when they pushed the Gamecocks to the brink before falling 79-77. \nThen on Sunday night in Chapel Hill, Louisville got its first ranked win of the season, taking down then-No. 11 North Carolina in overtime, 76-66. This Saturday, Louisville will get a chance to get another top 25 win when it faces No. 17 Tennessee at the Women's Champions Classic at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.Heading into the nonstop conference play of January and February, it's worth considering not just that Louisville might be one of the best teams in the underperforming ACC, but that they might be one of the top 10 teams in the country before all is said and done and a real threat to make it to the ninth Elite Eight of the Walz era.Here are a few reasons why Louisville is the early-season ACC frontrunner:Six of last year's elite freshmen class returnedRoster turnover is a way of life in college sports these days, and Louisville is not immune -- in fact, the Cardinals faced one of their starters from last season, Nyla Harris, in Chapel Hill on Sunday. But Louisville actually has a lot of roster consistency from last year, with seven returnees. This means that the Cardinals have players who know Walz's system, know the conference and, perhaps most importantly, know each other on and off the court. And these are high-pedigree players.\nIn 2024, the Cardinals had the sixth-best recruiting class in the nation, per ESPN. Of those seven standout freshmen, six returned to Louisville this season, including Tajianna Roberts, who led the team in minutes as a freshman and came into this season on the Naismith Trophy Women's Player of the Year Watch List, the Ann Meyers Drysdale Award Watch List and as a Preseason All-ACC selection. She's leading the team with 13 points per game right now, and after a slow start to the season in the UConn game, she has shown up when it matters the most, scoring 22 points against Kentucky, 20 against South Carolina and notching 11 points, four assists and four steals against North Carolina.\nAnother notable player from that elite recruiting class is Imari Berry. Even though Berry is still coming off of the bench like she did last season, she's averaging 9.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.4 steals in 21.2 minutes per game, all massive increases from last season. She hit several key shots down the stretch against the Tar Heels, and while Walz is still trying to get her to eliminate in-game mistakes, he's bullish on her potential.\"She's a kid that if she can figure it out, that she can be one of the best players in this league and one of the best players in college basketball, because she can do things that others can't, athletically, and she's so smooth,\" Walz said.\nElif Istanbulluoglu took a major leapThis is Turkish junior Elif Istanbulluoglu's third year at Louisville, and it is already far and away her most productive season. Last season, she came off the bench and only averaged three points and two rebounds in 13 minutes per game. This year, she is a starter averaging 8.8 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. In the win against North Carolina, the 6-foot-3 forward had a career-high 16 points. \"I thought Elif played extremely well. She made a couple big time shots. She's been getting in the gym, working on her 3, and it's starting to show and that allows us to spread the floor more,\" Walz said.\nThis summer, Walz was the assistant coach for the Turkish national team, and so got to spend more time with Istanbulluoglu and see her development up close.\nWalz told reporters that last season, he joked with Istanbulluoglu that her middle name was \"but,\" because she would always come up with excuses not to put in extra work. But this year, she told him she wasn't going to say \"but\" anymore. Things seemed to click for her this summer with the national team, when she would see the pros on her team go to the gym before practice, put up extra shots after practice and painstakingly take care of their bodies.\"She has dedicated herself to that, and it's what's changed it all,\" Walz said. \"She realizes she has seen success now because she's putting the time in, and that, to me, is what it's all about.\"\nTransfer Laura Ziegler is making a big impactLaura Ziegler was one of the most noteworthy transfers into the ACC this season, and she's living up to the hype -- and then some -- early on. The senior from Denmark spent the first three years of her collegiate career at Saint Joseph's, where she averaged 17.5 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists last season and was a Becky Hammon Mid-Major Player of the Year finalist.While her stats aren't as eye-popping this season, in part because her minutes are down due to the lopsided nature of many of Louisville's wins and in part because she's surrounded by more talent on the Cardinals than she was with the Hawks, she is still making a massive impact with 11.6 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.6 assists. Last week she was named the ACC Co-Player of the Week.\nAgainst North Carolina, she was a key force in getting Louisville early control of the game, scoring 13 of her season-high 17 points in the first quarter. Though her offensive production slowed down after that, Walz was incredibly pleased with how she played the entire game. He pointed out that she's a veteran player who is able to positively influence the game even when she isn't scoring -- and since the team is still so young, her experience is invaluable.\"What I appreciate about Laura is she didn't force any shots. She played 42 minutes for us, had two assists, zero turnovers and played a great basketball game,\" he said. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas coach Steve Sarkisian turned the clock back Thursday by hiring Will Muschamp as the program's new defensive coordinator. As part of the move, the Longhorns parted ways with Pete Kwiatkowski, who was a finalist for the Broyles Award just one year earlier.Muschamp is widely regarded as one of the top defensive coordinators of the 21st century, including a run to the national championship game in 2009 under then-Texas coach Mack Brown. He later had uneven head coaching stints at Florida and South Carolina, though his defenses generally remained solid.Now, Muschamp is tasked with helping stabilize a Texas program that became the first preseason No. 1 team to fall out of the top 10 since 2012 USC. Fortifying the defense is part of that equation, but it is far from the only issue.Kwiatkowski's defenses were consistently strong over the past three seasons as Texas rose to national prominence. In fact, the Longhorns' defense has rated ahead of the offense in FEI in each of the past four years. During last season's run to the national semifinals, Texas ranked No. 3 nationally in FEI defense.\nCracks did form in 2025, particularly in the secondary. In a 29-21 loss to Florida, Texas allowed more than 450 yards of offense to a team that finished 4-8. The Longhorns were also overwhelmed through the air in the second half of a 35-10 loss to Georgia, surrendering four passing touchdowns to Gunner Stockton.Getting back in the game Muschamp's background working with defensive backs should help address those issues. He also brings significant SEC recruiting credentials that could elevate the talent level on that side of the ball.Still, it has been a long time since Muschamp has called a defense. During his time at Georgia from 2021-25, he was not a playcaller, even while serving as co-defensive coordinator alongside Glenn Schumann. His last stint calling plays came at South Carolina in 2020. His units were inconsistent down the stretch during that tenure ranging from as high as No. 19 to outside the top 40 in FEI.\nOver the past five years, Muschamp worked closely with Georgia coach Kirby Smart, one of the game's top defensive minds. Optimistically, that experience may have helped sharpen his approach, though he was not an on-field assistant for the past two seasons.What's the real problem?The more glaring reality, however, is this: Defense has not been Texas' primary problem.While the Longhorns ranked in the top 10 defensively in three of the past four seasons, Sarkisian's offense has not cracked the top 15 nationally. Its best FEI finish was No. 17 in 2022, Bijan Robinson's final season at Texas. In 2025, the Longhorns ranked 10th among 16 SEC teams in both scoring offense and total offense.\nIn all three losses, Texas' offense stalled. The Longhorns were scoreless through three quarters against Ohio State, had just seven late in the third quarter against Florida and managed only 10 in a loss to Georgia that cost them a College Football Playoff berth.After the season, Sarkisian fired first-year running backs coach Chad Scott, but the rest of the offensive staff remains intact. Sarkisian will also continue calling plays, despite mounting calls for him to hire a true offensive coordinator. Yet throughout his tenure, Texas' offense has not faced the same level of scrutiny as its defense.Of the five offensive assistants Sarkisian hired in 2021, three remain. Running backs coach Stan Drayton, a holdover from the previous staff, left to become head coach at Temple. Wide receivers coach Andre Coleman, another holdover, is the only offensive assistant who has been fired. During the Sarkisian era, nine of Texas' 11 All-Americans have come on defense or special teams.\nTexas attempted a similar nostalgia play last season by bringing back legendary secondary coach Duane Akina as defensive passing game coordinator. Akina, ironically, coached defensive backs at Texas when Muschamp was defensive coordinator. The move backfired, as the Longhorns finished last in SEC play in passing defense.Maybe this time will be different. Muschamp is 15 years younger than Akina and still firmly in his coaching prime. But no defensive overhaul will elevate Texas to national-title caliber unless the offense is held to the same standard.\n            ",

Adaway's attorney, B. Keith Jackson, said to The Washington Post that the Gamecocks running back filed a complaint on Dec. 12 accusing the trooper of assault. The Brazos County (Texas) District Attorney is considering whether to move forward with charges.Adaway's attempts to learn the trooper's name have come up short. Neither Texas A&M Police nor the Texas Department of Public Safety declined to provide identification, even after Adaway called campus police to report an assault. Adaway said he wants to know the trooper's name and to receive an apology.In the month since the game, Adaway said he has lost sleep over the incident and has seen a University of South Carolina sports psychiatrist because of the emotional distress.\"You see this sort of thing on TV -- different scenarios of police bullying people here and there -- but you never feel it and understand it until you're actually in the situation,\" Adaway said to the Washington Post.The incident occurred in the final minute of the second quarter after Harbor scored an 80-yard touchdown. Harbor ran through the end zone and partway up a tunnel while holding the back of his right leg in apparent discomfort. Multiple teammates, including Adaway, followed him into the tunnel and walked with him back toward the field. As they exited from the tunnel, the trooper walked the opposite direction, bumped into them and turned around to point at and say something to them.\nReactions to the incident poured in throughout the sports world. LeBron James was among the numerous prominent figures to comment on the situation.The Texas DPS relieved the officer of his game-day duties and sent him home after the incident.\"The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is aware of the incident that occurred today during the Texas A&M football game,\" the DPS said in a statement. \"The DPS Trooper involved was sent home from the game. Our Office of Inspector General (OIG) is also aware of the incident and will be further looking into the matter. No additional information will be released at this time.\"\nThe touchdown that preceded the incident gave South Carolina a stunning 27-3 lead over Texas A&M. The Gamecocks eventually extended their advantage to 30-3 before the Aggies rallied back for the largest comeback in program history, erasing a 27-point deficit for a 31-30 victory to remain undefeated at the time.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn't want to speculate about his future with the Milwaukee Bucks. On Thursday, the two-time MVP addressed rumors that he and his agent were contemplating whether Milwaukee was still the right fit for him.Antetokounmpo claimed he was unaware of a report earlier this month about conversations between his agent, Alex Saratsis, and the Bucks about whether his NBA future was best served by remaining in Milwaukee or heading elsewhere. The Bucks' star player said that his priority was getting healthy and that his agent is free to have his own conversations without Antetokounmpo's involvement.\"I didn't hear about the report,\" Antetokounmpo told reporters. \"Again, if my agent is talking to the  Bucks about it, he is his own person. He can have any conversation he  wants about it. At the end of the day, I don't work for my agent; my  agent works for me. And there's going to be conversations that are going  to be made between him and the Bucks, and him and his other players,  and him and other teams and other GMs, executives around the league.  It's something that you can't control. \"But, at the end of the day, I  personally have not had the conversation with the Bucks. I'm still  locked in, locked in on my teammates. Most importantly, locked in on me  getting back healthy.\"\nAntetokounmpo has been sidelined since straining his calf against the Detroit Pistons on Dec 3. The Bucks initially believed he'd be out for two to four weeks, but Antetokounmpo says his four to six weeks is a more realistic timetable. Antetokounmpo, 31, believes he may have returned too early from a left adductor strain last month, leading to the calf injury four games later.\"Maybe it was  a mistake of me coming back a little bit earlier, because  once I come  back, now you're overcompensating,\" Antetokounmpo said.  \"The only way  you can pop your soleus is by overcompensating and then  having an  extreme amount of load or playing a lot of games in a short  period of time.\"In August, ESPN reported trade talks between the Bucks and the New York Knicks regarding Antetokounmpo. Nothing materialized as he recommitted himself to the Bucks, but talks of an eventual trade have only grown since.\n\"This  is the most I've ever been talked about in my career,\"  Antetokounmpo  said. \"I'm in my house with my kids and all that, and I'm  opening the TV, and it's like, 'Oh, Giannis is going to the Memphis  Grizzlies,' or  'Giannis is going to the Detroit Pistons.' Which, hey  man, I'm not going  to lie, I'm the hottest chick in the game right now.  No, I'm joking.\" The Bucks have struggled to recreate the magic that led them to become 2021 NBA champions. The Bucks carry an 11-16 record heading into Thursday's game against the Toronto Raptors, including a 2-8 stretch without Antetokounmpo on the court. Antetokounmpo insists that he won't use his status on the team as leverage or a threat to demand results from his team.\"I'm never going to have a meeting with my teammates and sit  everybody down and talk about like, 'Hey guys, hey, if we don't win I'm  going to get out of here,'\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Like, come on. We're  grown ... That's not going to happen. They're grown, too. I think  they understand the deal. You've just got to give urgency to the team.  Like, 'Guys, this is like serious. Who are we trying to be? We've got to  turn this around. We have time to turn this around.' And you've got to  have a little bit more urgency.\n\"I think I've had the conversation  with the coach about it. I think I've had the conversation with  individual players about it. I've been approached by teammates and asked  about the rumors because it also might affect their own life and their  own career. I'm straight with them, whatever that answer might be.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys are still alive for the 2025 NFL postseason with a 6-7-1 record, mathematically speaking, with a 0.8% chance according to CBS' SportsLine model. The reason for that is because there's one, incredibly narrow path for the Cowboys to still win the NFC East: Dallas winning all of their final three games AND the Philadelphia Eagles losing all of their final three games. The Eagles face the 4-10, Marcus Mariota-led Washington Commanders twice, so it's highly unlikely the Cowboys will be playing postseason football. In fact, with the Eagles facing Washington on Saturday in Week 16, Dallas could be officially eliminated from playoff contention before kickoff on Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers. However, head coach Brian Schottenheimer was firm that the goal is still to win and not play with an eye toward the future in Week 16. \"I want to win,\" Schottenheimer said on Wednesday. \"So the plan will be to play Dak.\"\nRemaining schedule for Cowboys and Eagles GameCowboysEaglesWeek 16vs. Chargers (10-4)at Commanders (4-10)Week 17at Commanders (4-10)at Bills (10-4)Week 18at Giants (2-12)vs Commanders (4-10)It's worth wondering if it makes sense to continue to play the 32-year-old Prescott this season given his injury history. He tore his hamstring in Week 9 of the 2024 season, and he fractured his ankle in the 2020 season. Last December around this time, Prescott was talking to CBS Sports about the small victory of being able to drive a car again as he progressed through rehab on his hamstring. \"Absolutely,\" Prescott said Thursday when asked about wanting to play in the final games of the season while being eliminated from the playoffs. \"Being a professional, this is my job. This is what I love to do. Sitting out last year and the times before, you don't take this game for granted. You play every game to win. You play every game with a chance to go to the playoffs and play in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, that's not always the case. If that's not the case when we take the field or whatever it may be, I'm thankful for the opportunity to play this game and I'm not going to ever pass it up.\"  \n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ranking 10 of the most important remaining games that will shape 2025 postseason\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSo what is Prescott playing for with the playoffs off the table? Pride, ending the team's current two-game losing streak and trying to help the Cowboys avoid consecutive losing seasons for the first time since a run of three in a row from 2000 to 2002. \"Yeah, I mean there's a lot to play for. Obviously pride is number one, but yeah, damn sure don't want to have a losing season. What, we've lost two games in a row? Damn sure not trying to lose three. You're not throwing the hat in,\" Prescott said. \"At the end of the day, we may not make the playoffs, but that's when you talk about pride and what this game means to you. Nothing should change: nothing the way we approach this thing, nothing should change. The guys have had a great week of practice, great week of prep. They don't seem like anyone's clocked out or checked out, and that's a credit to the leadership and the guys in the locker room. So yeah, we'll still be playing for a lot.\" The three-time Pro Bowler will certainly have a lot to stew about this offseason since he is on pace to become the first Cowboys quarterback ever to lead the NFL in passing yards (3,931) in a season. Dallas' offense is the NFL's No. 4 scoring offense (29.1 points per game), but the team's defense is the NFL's second-worst scoring defense (30.0 points per game allowed). The 2025 season will mark just the third of Prescott's 10-year career in which the Cowboys will miss the playoffs with him playing in at least 12 games along with the 2017 (9-7) and 2019 (8-8)  seasons. \"Yeah, this one stinks for sure. I hadn't felt this since my second year in the league [and fourth year in 2019], so it's a foreign feeling. I'd say for sure it's motivating as hell talking about all the changes and everything that's happened through the season,\" Prescott said. \"The ups and the downs: adding personnel, losing a teammate [Marshawn Kneeland]. A lot went into this year, and it's unfortunate that we were not in the position to be looking forward to the playoffs right now. I know just for me, not only me personally but for a lot of guys, this is a feeling that they'll carry into the offseason. We'll do our damnedest to make sure this doesn't happen again. So with the additions, with the leadership, with the men that we've brought in, that's one of those reasons why we can carry momentum using these three games for the offseason.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jake Paul isn't taking many shortcuts against Anthony Joshua. The two are set to throw down on Friday after Paul moved on from his original opponent, Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis, Paul vs. Joshua is a professional boxing match, unlike the exhibition fight that Paul was previously working towards. This means the result will impact their pro records. Paul (12-1, 6 KOs) and Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) will wear the standard 10-ounce gloves used by heavyweights. Paul has competed in 10-ounce gloves for most of his career, excluding the unusual 14-ounce gloves used for his fight with \"Iron\" Mike Tyson. Against Davis, Paul was planning to wear 12-ounce gloves.  The fight will be contested at heavyweight, stripping Paul of his normal weight advantage against opponents. Paul normally competes at cruiserweight, 65 pounds higher than WBA champion Davis' usual weight class. Paul's only previous heavyweight fight was against Tyson, who was 30 years older than Paul. However, there is a stipulation that says Joshua cannot weigh more than 245 pounds for the bout.\n\n        \n            \n                Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua fight predictions, undercard, odds, start time for showdown in Miami\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"People don't like the fact that I'm fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. But if we look at the people that don't want me to be here, but they want me to put an end to Jake Paul's show, I understand it and that's why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.\"Perhaps the only stipulation benefiting Paul is the round totals. Joshua has exclusively competed in 12-round fights for the last decade, excluding a 10-round maximum for his short fight with Francis Ngannou. His fight with Paul is scheduled for eight three-minute rounds. With many believing Joshua will knock out Paul, this reduces the time Paul must theoretically survive.\nPaul is preparing for undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career. The crossover star made a career by seeking opponents whose name value greatly outweighed their boxing experience, or who were significantly older or smaller than him. Though Joshua is 36 and likely beyond his prime, he should possess everything necessary to make short work of his opponent. Joshua is a two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist. Last year, he knocked out former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou in two rounds after Ngannou took Tyson Fury to a split decision.Paul vs. Joshua takes place on Saturday inside Miami's Kaseya Center.Who wins Anthony Joshua vs. Jake Paul on Dec. 19, and which massive longshot prop should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Friday, Dec. 19, heavyweight bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

Los Angeles turned Seattle over four times in that game, so even though Seattle controlled time of possession (37:49 to 22:11) and outgained the Rams by more than 160 yards, L.A. pulled out the victory.The Rams have won eight of their past nine games, with their only loss during that stretch coming three weeks ago against the Panthers, in a matchup where they committed an uncharacteristic three turnovers. They have otherwise been winning most of their games fairly handily, and they have ascended to the No. 1 seed in the conference as a result.Seattle has also won eight of nine, with the only loss during that stretch coming to the Rams. It struggled offensively last week in its win over the Colts, and has generally been inconsistent on that side of the ball since the loss to L.A. in Week 11. The Seahawks are looking to avenge their loss here and overtake the Rams for the top seed.  Will the Rams strengthen their hold on their division and conference leads, or will the Seahawks get their revenge? We'll find out soon enough. But before we highlight some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Rams vs. SeahawksDate: Thursday, Dec. 18 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field (Seattle)Stream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -1.5, O/U 42.5 via DraftKings SportsbookKey storylinesPlayoff picture. The Rams are the No. 1 seed in the NFC and hold the lead over the Seahawks in the NFC West race due to their having won the first matchup between the two teams. If they capture a win here, they'll have almost wrapped up the division title, because they'll need to fall a full game behind Seattle in order for the Seahawks to win the division, and because they're already a game ahead of the 49ers and have an easier path to going 5-1 in division games thanks to the fact that they get the Cardinals in Week 18, rather than the Seahawks. Seattle, of course, can complicate things immensely for Los Angeles by pulling off the win here and sliding into the No. 1 slot in the conference. The MVP race. Matthew Stafford is the heavy favorite heading into the final three weeks of the season, with the odds implying that he has a 75% chance to win the award, which is pretty incredible. For him to keep this stranglehold on the award, the Rams probably need to hang onto the top seed in the conference down the stretch. Especially if he puts together a strong performance against a Seahawks defense that is one of the best in the NFL, he'll have the opportunity to create a really powerful narrative heading into the stretch run. Sam Darnold has an outside chance at crashing the party if he puts together a spectacular stretch run and the Seahawks take the No. 1 seed, but he's more likely to merit down-ballot votes in that scenario than to actually capture the trophy. Davante Adams injury. Adams has been nursing a hamstring injury and appearing on the injury report, and he appeared to aggravate the issue last week. He didn't practice in advance of this game and likely won't play here. In his absence, the Rams will almost surely funnel as many targets as possible to Puka Nacua, but they'll also likely utilize more of their multi-tight end sets. Colby Parkinson has been playing his best football lately and could be a big factor here. Sam Darnold vs. Chris Shula. Darnold is probably seeing Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula in his nightmares. He has had a terrible go of things in his last two matchups with Shula's defense: In Week 11, he threw four interceptions in a two-point loss to Los Angeles. In the playoff matchup vs. the Rams last year, Darnold was sacked a career-high nine times in an 18-point defeat. He has looked utterly lost in both games, seeing the kinds of ghosts that he did against Bill Belichick and the Patriots back during his days with the Jets. Unless he can figure out a way to exorcise those demons, the Seahawks are drawing dead here. Prediction\nEven without Davante Adams, I feel comfortable rolling with L.A. here. That's mostly because of what I expect to happen on the opposite side of the ball. Again, Darnold is probably seeing Shula in his nightmares given what has happened to him in their last two matchups. The Seahawks have also just not looked very good offensively for a few weeks now. I suspect we'll get a lower-scoring game here, but I like the Rams to win it. \nPick: Rams 20, Seahawks 16\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

He was honored by topping the promotion's pound-for-pound rankings in both 2022 and 2023, and at one point he had an 11-fight win streak within the featherweight division. While he has just a 2-3 record over his last five bouts, two of those came when Volkanovski stepped up in weight class and challenged Islam Makhachev for the UFC Lightweight Championship, losing both bouts to Makhachev.The other defeat saw the Aussie drop the featherweight title to Ilia Topuria in Feb. 2024. However, he then won the vacant UFC Featherweight Championship in his next bout, which was the first match with Lopes. Volkanovski won via unanimous decision as he landed more than twice as many significant strikes (158) than his opponent landed total strikes (71). That was the 11th decision victory of Volkanovski's MMA career, as he also has 13 KOs and three submission triumphs. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 31-year-old Lopes has youth on his side versus Volkanovski, in addition to five inches over his 5-foot-6 opponent. A native of Brazil, Lopes has a BJJ background and signed with UFC in 2023. After dropping his first fight, he then went on a five-bout winning streak, earning Performance of the Night twice during that span. That led to his first title shot versus Volkanovski at UFC 314 in April 2025, and though the Brazilian came up short, the bout was awarded Fight of the Night.\nWhile Volkanovski has been idle since then, Lopes took a fight against Jean Silva, a fellow Brazilian who was ranked and had recorded five straight finish victories. Lopes prevailed in that September 2025 bout via TKO with a spinning elbow and punches. That was his 11th knockout victory, to go along with 12 submissions and four wins via decision. Neither Lopes nor Volkanovski have ever lost via submission, though both have tasted defeat by knockout and on the scorecards.

This is a modest edge on the favorite, but playable at this price.

    "body": "\n        The second numbered event in as many weeks for the UFC took place in Australia on Saturday as featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski fought in front of his home fans in Sydney for the first time since 2017. Volkanovski scored a second straight win over Diego Lopes in the main event, recording a clear unanimous decision to equal Jose Aldo's UFC record of eight wins in title bouts at 145 pounds. In the co-main event, Benoit Saint-Denis put a hurting on veteran Dan Hooker in a second-round stoppage before calling out the elite of the division. Here's a look at the biggest takeaways from an exciting night of action inside Qudos Bank Arena at UFC 325. 1. Death, taxes and Alexander Volkanovski on top of the featherweight divisionEven though the 37-year-old Volkanovski wouldn't cop to it himself during fight week out of respect for Aldo, whom he defeated in 2019, we can all say it for him: \"Alexander the Great\" is the best featherweight in MMA history. Volkanovski is 18-1 at 145 pounds throughout his 14-year pro career (including a mark of 13-1 in the UFC), with his only blemish being a second-round knockout loss to current lightweight champion Ilia Topuria in 2024. And not only did Volkanovski regain the vacant UFC title following the setback, he defended once more in his rematch with Lopes on Saturday that somehow looked even easier than the five-round decision he claimed nine months ago. Volkanovski took a knee on a flash knockdown in Round 3 but outside of that, it was lights out as the Australian met Lopes' pressure with clean boxing, a stiff jab and constant footwork patterns that never allowed his Brazilian foe to get into a rhythm. The fact that Volkanovski still appears to be at the top of his game this far into his 30s in a smaller weight division in which speed is prioritized is remarkable. A true living legend of the Octagon, who owns three career wins over Max Holloway, it wouldn't be out of bounds to suggest that Volkanovski is a top 15 fighter in the history of the sport. And even though some difficult style matchups remain should he choose to stay active and continue his title, it would be hard to imagine Volkanovski not being favored from a betting standpoint against the likes of Movsar Evloev, Lerone Murphy, Jean Silva or Aljamain Sterling.\n2. The lightweight division is reshuffling the deck at a rapid rateEven with 37-year-old Justin Gaethje turning back time last Saturday at UFC 324 to claim the interim title for the second time in an exciting win over Paddy Pimblett, the lightweight division has seen many of its all-action heroes retire or enter their twilight in recent years, from Dustin Poirier and Michael Chandler to Charles Oliveira and even Conor McGregor. But a new breed of 155-pound fighters are on the rise, as evidenced by Ilia Topuria's championship win last year and the rise of top contender Arman Tsarukyan. Three more lightweights scored breakthrough wins on Saturday's main card to move closer to title contention; Benoit Saint Denis, Mauricio Ruffy and newcomer Quillan Sallkilld. Saint Denis improved to 4-0 with four stoppage wins since he suffered a pair of devastating losses in 2024 and suddenly looks like a legit title contender following a violent second-round TKO win over a brave Dan Hooker. BSD took some damage at times but was able to take the fight to the ground and suffocate Hooker when it mattered most. Ruffy, meanwhile, bounced back from a humbling submission loss to Saint Denis last September by switching camps and continents to deliver an impressive second-round stoppage of Rafael Fiziev to likely catapult himself back into the top 10. But it was Sallkilld who very much looked like the long-term future of the division when the 26-year-old improved to 4-0 in the UFC since making his debut one year ago by submitting Jamie Mullarkey with relative ease.\n3. There are no excuses left for Tai TuivasaEntering the fight riding a five-fight losing streak (including four by stoppage) and an 18-month layoff to heal himself mentally and physically, Tuivasa's Sydney homecoming turned out to be an absolute disaster. Even though he nearly rallied for a dramatic stoppage win in Round 3 against an opponent, Tallison Teixeira, who had never fought past the first round in 12 career pro fights, Tuivasa's lack of cardio after so much time away was embarrassing. Claiming he undertook the layoff to heal himself both mentally and physically, Tuivasa somehow looked in worse physical shape than he did amid the losing skid and clearly hadn't improved on his lack of a ground game as the 6-foot-8 Teixeira, who isn't known as a ground specialist, largely relied on takedowns and top pressure to win the first two rounds. The only fighters in UFC history to stay employed following losing skids of at least six consecutive fights are BJ Penn, Tony Ferguson and Sam Alvey. Given that Tuivasa is a fan favorite who competes in an exciting style and is still just 32 in a division that ages slower than the rest, he just might get another opportunity inside the Octagon. The real question is, however, how much pride does Tuivasa have left to try and save his career? It's now or never. \n            ",

What he sometimes lacked was elite composure. At UFC 325, Ruffy showed off the championship composure that comes from training with UFC featherweight champ Alexander Volkanovski. Ruffy collided with fellow striker Rafael Fizev on Saturday. It was a pivotal fight for Ruffy, who was coming off his first UFC loss against Benoit Saint Denis. Ruffy's demise in that fight was his urgency to force a memorable finish. Against Fiziev, he took his time. Fiziev looked good earlier, pressuring Ruffy to the fence and lighting him up with kicks. Ruffy started refreshingly slow and found his groove towards the end of Round 1. Follow live updates on UFC 325: Alexander Volkanovski vs. Diego Lopes as event debuts on Paramount+That slow escalation served him well. Ruffy started taking control of the fight in the second frame. In the last minute, he blasted Fiziev with an ultra-precise right cross. The punch sounded like a baseball bat, putting Fiziev in immediate trouble. Fiziev barely survived the initial onslaught of strikes, but fell over immediately after getting to his feet. The referee intervened with 30-seconds left in the second round.\nPost-fight, Ruffy called out Paddy Pimblett and Conor McGregor.\n            \n    ",

UFC headed all the way across the globe on Saturday to Sydney, Australia for UFC 325 and it gave fans plenty to get excited about -- both for the present and future.In the main event, Alexander Volkanovski once again proved to be too much to handle for challenger Diego Lopes as the Aussie handled his business to take a unanimous decision and retain his featherweight crown. \"Volk\" has now equaled the legendary Jose Aldo for most title defenses at 145 pounds and it doesn't appear anything can slow him down from passing it at present. Elsewhere on the card, Benoit Saint Denis continued his climb up the lightweight rankings with a thrashing of Dan Hooker. Saint Denis battered Hooker after securing a takedown in the second round before the referee finally waved the fight off. Plus, Mauricio Ruffy bounced back from a defeat against Saint Denis to score a knockout of his own against Rafael Fiziev in a featured bout. Both men could find themselves in interesting matchups next as they jockey for position in the title race.\nCBS Sports was with you all week long with the latest news, features and other content around this massive event.

The incident, caught on video, took place after Taylor and an individual wearing a police uniform shared a brief exchange, which quickly escalated as the officer grabbed his handcuffs from his belt and put them on Taylor.HBCU Gameday reported that football players from Morehouse came onto the floor following the game's conclusion, which prompted Taylor to approach security over its handling of the situation. Tuskegee AD Reginald Ruffin told HBCU Gameday that Taylor was simply trying to make sure conference-mandated security protocols were being enforced and that Taylor was concerned about a security breach.\"I am at a loss for words and I am upset about how I was violated and treated today,\" Taylor told the Field of 68. \"For my players, my family and people of Tuskegee to witness that is heartbreaking for me. I was simply trying to get the football team out of the handshake line as they were following right behind me and the team yelling obscenities!  It was a very dangerous situation.\"\nVideo of the incident shows Taylor in a state of bewilderment as he appears to react in real-time to being told he is being handcuffed. His shock quickly turned into a smile, seemingly laughing at how outrageous the situation was.\nTaylor was later released and was able to make the trip back home on the Tuskegee team bus.\n            \n    ",

You can catch all the action on CBS Sports Golazo Network as this continental competition takes place. Arsenal booked their place in the tournament by winning the UEFA Women's Champions League over Barcelona before defeating Moroccan side ASFAR in the semifinals. Corinthians are the holders of the CONMEBOL Copa Libertadores Femenina where they defeated Deportivo Cali before getting past the Concacaf representatives, NY/NJ Gotham FC.How to watch Arsenal vs. CorinthiansDate: Sunday, Feb. 1 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonTV: CBS Sports Golazo Network While Arsenal and Corinthians meet for the title, Gotham and ASFAR will meet in the third-place game, which is also on Sunday. Arsenal got a little healthier during their semifinal game as Choe Kelly returned from a two-month injury absence in the 77th minute, and having her for the final versus an organized Corinthians side will be important. \"It's hard even talking about it, because we know how difficult this game will be,\" Corinthians midfielder Duda Sampaio said. \"It will be one of the hardest games of my career. We know how great Arsenal is in Europe, and we are doing our best to be ready to make another great game, just like we did in the semis.\" Corinthians have already shown that South American soccer needs to be respected after defeating Gotham despite the NWSL side holding most of the possession, and that will be a similar game plan that they'll need to stay in the match against Arsenal. The winner will receive $2.3 million which is the largest ever payout in a women's soccer tournament, while the runners-up receive $1 million, so the financial incentives are also important here.\nIt's the first meeting between Arsenal and Corinthians, and the Gunners will have the backing of home support for the match.How to watch Gotham FC vs. ASFARDate: Sunday, Feb. 1 | Time: 9:45 a.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonTV: CBS Sports Golazo Network \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Don't look now, but despite all their turmoil this season in moving on from manager Ruben Amorim and bringing in Michael Carrick to steady the ship, Manchester United are firmly in the race for a Champions League place in the league. Carrick has overseen arguably the toughest two matches that a manager could lead, facing Manchester City and Arsenal, and emerged from that with two victories. While these could lead to a situation where Carrick ends up becoming the permanent manager of the Red Devils, this was an improvement that was beginning before he came to the club.How to watch Manchester United vs. Fulham, oddsDate: Sunday, Feb. 1 | Time: 9 a.m. ETLocation: Old Trafford -- Manchester, EnglandLive stream: PeacockOdds: Manchester United -175; Draw +350; Fulham +400Taking a look at the chart below, Manchester United's form really began to move in the right direction after defeating Crystal Palace on Matchday 13. From that point, they've only lost one match in the Premier League while charging up the table. Draws have kept them from being firmly in the top four at this stage of the season, but it's clear that Amorim was doing something right even when he departed the club.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            That base does help Carrick, as he only needs to be a true caretaker manager, but he is building on the good that Amorim already instilled in the squad while tweaking things to take them forward. After already getting two massive victories in his first two matches in charge, some of his hardest work is already behind him. United control their own destiny, hosting a Fulham side that struggles on the road, and three points will be the expectation. He will need to manage an injury to Patrick Dorgu, who is out with a thigh injury. Dorgu has found his form as a winger with two goals and an assist since moving into an advanced role for the team. With Amad Diallo, Bryan Mbuemo, and Matheus Cunha, Carrick will still have options in the attack, but he'll need to ensure that they don't let the defense falter while putting more attackers on the pitch. \nVia Harry Wilson, Fulham are a side who can shoot from anywhere on the pitch to make things happen, and Senne Lammens will need to be aware of that. But again, a win is expeced and Carrick knows plenty about playing under the pressure of expectations at Old Trafford. If he's able to instill that into his side, we could begin to witness the return of United, but with the club riding a six-match unbeaten streak in the league, it will also be important to see how they respond when they eventually lose their first match under Carrick.\n            ",

Ortega announced on Instagram that a series of injuries has forced him to take time to recover, as well as receive physical therapy.  The fight with Moicano was to be Ortega's lightweight debut, a move he has been planning for more than a year. Now, that move will need to wait until later in 2026.\"Obviously, the news is coming out that no longer am I fighting March 7 in Vegas,\" Ortega said in an Instagram story. \"I'm OK. Health is good. No surgeries, nothing crazy like that, but I do need to take a little bit, some time off to nurse these injuries that I have right now. It just sucks. It's not crazy like where I need to have surgery, but I have to rest it and let it heal and chill and do some physical therapy. I'm going to be on that mission. That's it.\"But it's just a little bit delayed. Nothing crazy. I'm still planning on fighting twice this year. Look out.\"Ortega holds a submission win over Moicano, though that victory came at UFC 217 in July 2017.\nLengthy stints on the sidelines have plagued Ortega's career over the past decade. He previously was out of action from December 2018 to October 2020, and again from July 2022 to February 2024.The move to lightweight came after a 2-5 stretch at featherweight beginning in December 2018. Over that stretch, Ortega came up short in featherweight title bids against Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski, with both bouts receiving Fight of the Night honors.Ortega has also badly struggled to make the featherweight limit in recent years. He had to withdraw from a UFC 303 bout with Diego Lopes the day of the fight after missing weight, and then experienced complications cutting weight for his most recent fight, a loss to Aljamain Sterling, which had to be contested at a 153-pound catchweight. Ortega claimed he passed out for an extended period of time during the weight cut for the Sterling fight.\nUFC 326 takes place March 7 from T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The card is headlined by a BMF title bout between current ceremonial titleholder Max Holloway and challenger Charles Oliveira.\n            \n    ",

On Saturday, Gunther beat Styles at the 2026 Royal Rumble. The match stipulated that Styles would retire from WWE should he lose. The aftermath raised questions about what exactly that means.Last year, Styles announced that he'd retire from professional wrestling in 2026. His oath was tested earlier than anyone expected in the stakes of their Rumble match. On Saturday, the superstars told a story about a defiant, world-class veteran trying to overcome an elite talent in their physical prime. Styles put forth a willful effort before ultimately succumbing to Gunther's sleeper hold. Styles received a standing ovation after the loss. Post-match, Styles teased placing his iconic gloves in the ring -- a symbolic retirement gesture -- but refused to after objections from the fans. Styles placed the gloves back on his hands, raising his arms triumphantly. Styles soaked in the adoration before walking away reluctantly, fighting back tears.Styles' half-commitment raised questions about what a WWE retirement means. He could depart for TNA, a WWE-partnered promotion for which Styles was once a cornerstone. If his WWE contract lapsed, he could potentially jump to another promotion like AEW. His alleged retirement could also be part of a more elaborate WWE storyline.\nWhatever the case, Saturday's outcome furthered Gunther's reputation as a modern-day legend killer. In six months, he's won retirement matches against Goldberg, John Cena, and Styles. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is currently preparing for the biggest game of his life, Super Bowl LX, but not everything is going as smooth as he probably would've liked. The starting QB and one of this year's MVP favorites showed up on the team's injury report just over a week before they face the Seattle Seahawks in the big game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.Maye was limited on Thursday with a shoulder injury and did not practice on Friday, with his coach Mike Vrabel saying No. 10 would've been out there if not for the illness.Backup Josh Dobbs took first team reps in Maye's place on Friday. \n        \n            \n                Patriots QB Drake Maye could become 'one of the best to ever play,' ex-UNC coach Mack Brown believes\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMaye and Vrabel have both addressed the injury this week and the overarching messaging from both is at this time of the year, no one is at 100 percent, but the expectation is he will be ready to go on Sunday, February 8.The 2024 No. 3 overall pick admitted he was dealing with \"bumps and bruises\" after the AFC Championship road win against the Denver Broncos and this week said \"I feel good.\"\nOn Thursday, Vrabel was asked how much concern he has about Maye's health to which he responded, \"not much.\"The severity of the injury is not known, so there is no need to hit the panic button just yet, but way-too-soon overreactions are what football fans are best at. One concern Patriots Nation has is whether Maye's shoulder will be able to last all game. As a mobile quarterback and going up against an elite defense, their concerns are certainly legitimate.If Maye does need to take a play, series or longer on the sideline, the next man up is Joshua Dobbs. So let's dive into his career and the path he took to get to New England.\nThe 31-year-old joined the league in 2017, when the Pittsburgh Steelers selected him in the fourth round at No. 135 overall. He remained in the Steel City until 2019 and since then has bounced around the league. He was with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019, was back with the Steelers from 2020 to 2021 and in 2022 went from the Cleveland Browns, to the Detroit Lions to the Tennessee Titans. He went back to the Browns in 2023, but only as a member of the practice squad. In 2023 he was also with the Arizona Cardinals and Minnesota Vikings, before joining the San Francisco 49ers in 2024.He signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Patriots in March of 2025, marking his ninth NFL team.\nDobbs has not started a game this season with his most recent start coming in 2024, a 47-24 loss against the Cardinals. In that game he had 29 completions, a 67.4 completion percentage, two touchdowns and two interceptions. He is 3-12 in starts in the NFL. In his nine year career he has 351 passes for 3,346 yards and a completion percentage of 62.8. He has 17 touchdowns, with 15 interceptions along with 515 rushing yards and 8 rushing touchdowns. The Patriots went from back-to-back 4-13 seasons to a Super Bowl bid thanks to a new head coach, bulking up their defense in the offseason, improving their offensive line and one of the biggest reasons was the arm of Drake Maye. He was fourth in the league in passing yards (4,394), was third in passing touchdowns (31), fourth in rushing yards (450) and fifth in rushing touchdowns (5).\nWhile Maye's numbers have shrunk over the playoffs, that in part can be attributed to going up against top five defenses, playing in two bad weather games and inexperience in the postseason. Having Maye at as close to 100% is crucial for a New England team who are already coming in as 4.5-point underdogs.The team's third string quarterback is Tommy DeVito, who went viral during his time with the New York Giants. Super Bowl LX will kickoff at 6:30 p.m. ET and halfway through the game Bad Bunny will take the stage for the halftime show. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAWRENCE, Kan. -- It was one of the most anticipated games at Allen Fieldhouse in the past few years, a matchup of the projected top two NBA Draft picks and 2025's No. 1-and No. 2-ranked high school players, Darryn Peterson of Kansas and AJ Dybantsa of BYU, in a key game for the Big 12 title race. Saturday marked just the fourth time in the internet rankings era that 247Sports' top two high schoolers had faced off as college freshmen. Even a building as historic as Allen Fieldhouse had never seen a matchup like this.The crowd, which included almost 40 scouts for NBA teams and general managers for the Pacers, Nets, Hawks, Spurs and Thunder, was appropriate for the event. ESPN's College Gameday came here, Kansas legend Paul Pierce and 2026's top-ranked player Tyran Stokes of Seattle (Wash.) Rainier Beach showed up for the spectacle, and the usually raucous Allen Fieldhouse crowd was in full throat well before tipoff.Answers were expected to be given on Saturday. Can either Kansas or BYU seriously contend for a Big 12 title and eventually a Final Four berth? Should Peterson -- who has missed half the season with various injuries -- or college basketball's second-leading scorer, Dybantsa, be considered the favorite for the No. 1 pick in June's NBA Draft?\nAfter running out to a huge early lead and holding on for dear life as BYU senior Richie Saunders unleashed a 33-point scoring barrage, Kansas cleared a big hurdle to move to 6-2 in the Big 12 with a 90-82 win.With 18 first-half points, Peterson showed why 247Sports ranked him No. 1 in high school and why he's the slight favorite to go No. 1 in June. For the first 20 minutes, he made the Fieldhouse his playground, drilling effortless 3-pointers, scoring at will off the dribble and making big-time plays on the defensive end. With just over two minutes remaining in the half, he nearly took the roof off the place with a contested jam on a drive down the right side of the lane. It was everything that Kansas fans wanted to see as they built a 53-33 halftime lead.\nThen Bill Self and the Kansas faithful saw what they'd rather not see again. Just a few minutes into the second half, their star freshman checked himself out of the game and never returned due to cramping issues that have plagued him all year. Peterson has played in 11 of Kansas 21 games and, if he misses the next game as a result of any possible injury from Saturday, it will mark the fourth time his availability has toggled from yes to no. \nThe continued uncertainty around Peterson's status is a serious concern for a Kansas team that, with him at full health, has a legitimate Final Four ceiling. Since its 2022 national championship, Kansas has yet to make to to the NCAA Tournament's second weekend. \"That was the real DP there, you guys haven't seen it like we have,\" Self said of Peterson's 18 points and three steals in the first half. \"It's just unfortunate that we didn't see it for 40 minutes.\"(The dunk) was athletic and it was off a sprained ankle, so that was good to see. He showed a lot in his bag in the first half.\"\nPeterson is already one of the most prolific scorers in Kansas single-season history.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            On the other side, Dybantsa came out slow. Often matched up with Kansas big man Flory Bidunga, Dybantsa seemed to be bothered a bit by the length and quickness, and he had some difficulties finding his spots. As he's done all year, he was able to get things going a bit in the second half to finish with 17 points.\"I thought he was OK,\" BYU coach Kevin Young said. \"He was holding the ball a little too much in the first half. I thought he was better in the second half. He was driving and getting to his spots and looking for some of those turnarounds, and I thought he did a good job of kicking the basketball out. \"I'm not crying over spilled milk or anything, but the guy leads the country in fouls drawn and got to the line four times tonight. I thought there were times where he could have been fouled that they missed, but that's life and you have to keep playing. All in all, it was, I thought, a game for him that he handled well relative to all of the outside noise.\"\nThere is some bright side for Kansas when it comes to Peterson's continued cramping issues. Senior guard Melvin Council continues to come up big in big moments, and freshman big man Bryson Tiller is coming along and had his best game of the year, notching 21 points -- including a trio of first-half triples -- and grabbing seven rebounds.Now 16-5, this Kansas group is coming together as it prepares to face Texas Tech next. But if they're going to compete at the highest level and really compete for titles, they need their most dynamic player to be available, and nobody knows that better than Self.\"We can be competitive, but for us to actually have a chance to do anything that I would consider to be special, we need everybody healthy,\" Self said. \n\"It's disappointing that he couldn't go because of cramps. He didn't cramp last game, but he did today, and I certainly hope we can figure that out. But it tells me that we may not be consistently where some teams play night in and night out, but on any night, we can play with anybody.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The San Francisco Giants have agreed to terms on a one-year pact with free-agent infielder Luis Arraez, according to ESPN. Arraez is expected to earn $12 million and play second base, per El Extrabase.Arraez, 28, is a three-time All-Star honoree and Batting Title winner. Over the past three seasons, he's batted .319/.355/.416 (111 OPS+) with seven home runs and eight stolen bases on average. Last year, he hit .292/.327/.392 (99 OPS+) while striking out in a career-low 3.1% of his plate appearances.\nNevertheless, Arraez's unidimensional offensive game and lack of true defensive or positional value landed him at No. 44 on CBS Sports' offseason rankings of the winter's top 50 free agents. Here's part of what we wrote at the time:\nArraez is a unidimensional player. He doesn't walk or run often and he can't field or slug. He's a pure singles merchant who excels at putting the pine on the cowhide, to the extent that he connected on nearly 95% of his swings. That's an incredible skill, it's just not one that's profitable anymore for teams or individual players. Of course, it only takes one club with an outmoded perspective -- or a half-understanding of why the Blue Jays enjoyed so much success this season -- for Arraez to land a more lucrative deal than expected.Arraez joins a Giants team that went 81-81 last season while giving at least 40 second-base appearances to Tyler Fitzgerald, Casey Schmitt, and Christian Koss. Collectively, San Francisco's second basemen hit .217/.273/.343 with 14 home runs. Arraez should be an upgrade at the plate. The question, then, is how large the advantage will remain when defense is factored into the equation.\n            \n    ",

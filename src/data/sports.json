    "body": "\nThe biggest NFL game of the year is just around the corner, as the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will take the field at Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl 60. According to the latest NFL odds, Seattle is favored by 4.5 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite to win Super Bowl MVP, with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye at +240. Much has been made of the dynamic talents and strong defenses on both sides. However, before the game kicks off, the team captains will meet at midfield for the opening coin toss, providing the most avid of sports bettors their first chance to get a win. Wagering on minutiae like the coin toss is a hallmark of Super Bowl betting, as sportsbooks like DraftKings will offer odds on just about everything, from the coin toss to the color of the Gatorade dumped on the winning coach. CBS Sports gambling and Fantasy sports managing editor R.J. White has been analyzing these betting opportunities for years, in addition to being one of SportsLine's top NFL experts -- he's gone 22-15-1 (+545) in his last 38 over/under picks, for instance. Now he's sharing his Super Bowl 60 coin toss pick.Here are the latest odds for Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings:\nSuper Bowl coin toss pickR.J. White's coin toss pick: Heads (+100)White's analysis: This is my sixth year making an official pick on the Super Bowl coin toss, and using my unparalleled analysis of all things football, I've compiled an impressive 3-2 record in that stretch, a 10% improvement on the average coin flip analyst. For four straight years, I've made Tails my pick, and it's had a 50% success rate, but now I'm returning to my roots and backing the side that started it all, Heads.Why? They say \"tails never fails,\" but that is simply not true. \"They\" also said the Chiefs never fail, and there's no way the Ravens miss the playoffs, and Joe Burrow will get the Bengals back on track, and Jayden Daniels has the Commanders going in the right direction, and this might finally be the Lions' year. When all of that proved untrue, \"they\" said this has to be the year for Josh Allen and the Bills -- look at all the great teams that aren't in the playoffs!Instead, we get two teams that were +6000 or longer to win the Super Bowl prior to the season playing for the title. This has been the year of all years for defied expectations. Tails never fails? In the year of our Lord 2026? Give me Heads.(Also, as I say every year, only make this play if you're getting even odds. Despite the impeccable analysis above, there is a 50% chance for each side to win this year's Super Bowl coin toss.)Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.\n            ",

They had won 12 of their previous 15 games and are wrapping up a four-game homestand, while the Knicks are coming off a double-overtime thriller against Denver. Guard Jalen Brunson was among three New York players who saw at least 47 minutes of action in the second game of a back-to-back. The Pistons have won four straight meetings between these teams, and SportsLine's model has them winning in 67% of simulations on Friday night. Back the Pistons at bet365 here:Celtics (-225) vs. Heat\"Will eat this number and go big -- anchor leg if need be (will buy out if any Boston key person out). It's high but probably should be another 50 cents higher,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"Still no Tyler Herro for the Heat, who did nothing at the deadline to stay mediocre. At least the Bulls got like a cacophony of second-round picks. Maybe they find the next Nikola Jokic in Round 2. LOL. Then trade him probably. And I think one of those Bulls' traded guys, Nikola Vucevic, makes the Celtics that much better. He solves a few of their issues. Could the Heat win? Obviously, but I am kinda puttering along in the NBA so I need to get going. But I usually take off post-break.\" Back the Celtics at bet365 here:Bucks +1.5 vs. Pacers (-110)Indiana is tied for last place in the Eastern Conference, as the Pacers have been unable to overcome the absence of superstar guard Tyrese Haliburton. The Pacers dealt Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson and three draft picks to the Clippers for center Ivica Zubac and forward Kobe Brown. Former Pacer Myles Turner is averaging 18 points and seven rebounds in the last five games for Milwaukee. Additionally, Kevin Porter Jr. returned from an oblique injury in an overtime win against New Orleans on Wednesday, and he is one reason why Milwaukee is covering the spread 62% of the time. Back the Bucks at bet365 here:\nLooking for more NBA betting picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Friday.

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl 60 matchup is set, with the New England Patriots representing the AFC and the Seattle Seahawks coming from the NFC. You can make Patriots vs. Seahawks picks well before the kickoff on Sunday, Feb. 8, and it's fitting these are the only two teams left to make NFL bets on. That's because they boast the two best spread records this year, with Seattle at 14-5 and New England at 13-6-1. However, that also means they aren't making it easy to make 2026 Super Bowl predictions which such a small ATS margin between them.Seattle is favored by 4.5 points (O/U 45.5) per the latest Super Bowl odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Underdogs have covered 52.6% of the time in Super Bowl history, which is close to the flip of a coin, so that Super Bowl spread trend may not help much with your Seahawks vs. Patriots bets. Thus, seeking out some NFL betting advice is essential. Before locking in any Super Bowl picks or NFL prop bets, be sure to check out the Super Bowl best bets and predictions from SportsLine's red-hot Vegas experts. \nSportsLine has more than 40 hand-picked Vegas experts who excel in multiple spots. The NFL, however, is a strength for the site as SportsLine currently has five total experts who are on NFL runs that have returned $1,000 or more for $100 players and one who has returned more than $1,500. Anybody following their NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, with Super Bowl 60 quickly approaching, SportsLine's top NFL experts are already locking in their picks. Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top Super Bowl expert picks from Micah RobertsRoberts, a former Vegas bookmaker, is 11-4 (+658) over his last 15 Patriots ATS picks. For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under 77.5 rushing yards (-125).\"New England's run defense is damn stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (45.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too. Our model has 44 points.\" See the rest of Severance's picks here, and bet the total here:\nHow to make 2026 Super Bowl picksSportsLine's team of experts also includes Brady Kannon, a former SuperContest winner who enters Super Bowl LX on a sizzling 29-15 run (66%) on NFL picks, returning over $1,200 for $100 players. You can find out who his NFL picks are for the Super Bowl 2026 here. If you are looking for NFL picks, NFL props, or NFL best bets for Super Bowl 60, SportsLine has you covered with its proven team of experts.

UConn is already 2-0 in MSG this season with wins over Illinois and Florida and Hurley is currently boasting an 11-2 record over his last 13 games in the arena.\" Bet UConn to win at DraftKings here:Pistons (-170) to defeat the KnicksThe model isn't too concerned about Detroit's 126-117 home loss to the lowly Wizards on Thursday, as it may have been the classic case of looking ahead to a showdown the following day. The Pistons have the best record in the East at 37-13, and the Knicks are tied for second at 33-18.

The Pistons defeated the Knicks, 121-90, on Jan. 5 in Detroit in their first meeting this season, and the model sees value in betting New York's eight-game winning streak to end on Friday. The Pistons are 20-6 at home this season, while the Knicks are 11-12 on the road. The model projects the Pistons to win in 67% of simulations. Bet the Pistons to win at DraftKings here:Celtics (-5.5) vs. Heat (-118)The Celtics have won four straight games to improve to 33-18, with only the Pistons having a better record than them in the East. Guard Jaylen Brown has proven capable of being a team's Alpha as Brown ranks fourth in the league in scoring at 29.5 points per game, including back-to-back games with at least 30 points. Derrick White had 28 points in Boston's 114-93 win over the Rockets on Wednesday, with 7-footer Neemias Queta playing as a force inside with 19 rebounds. His size can challenge Bam Adebayo and Miami as the Heat are coming off a 127-115 loss to the Hawks on Tuesday. Boston will host on Friday, and the Celtics are 16-8 at home this season, while the Heat are 11-15 on the road.

Brunson didn't break 26 points in any of his prior four games before Wednesday against Denver. He averaged 23.3 ppg in January, and he's gone Under this total in 11 of 16 games since the start of January.

Although Leonard is thought of as more of a scorer, he's a capable passer as well, averaging more than three assists per game in seven straight seasons. He's gone Over this total in three of his last four games, averaging five assists per game during that span. The Clippers play the Kings, who rank 27th in scoring defense (120.5 ppg allowed).

Adebayo went Under this total in both games against the Celtics this season, including securing just four rebounds over 33 minutes in their last matchup on Jan. 15.

    "description": "\n        The Philadelphia 76ers traded Jared McCain to the Oklahoma City Thunder before Thursday's deadline, and, generally speaking, their fans aren'",
    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia 76ers traded Jared McCain to the Oklahoma City Thunder before Thursday's deadline, and, generally speaking, their fans aren't thrilled. \"They can go f--- themselves,\" Spike Eskin, co-host of The Rights To Ricky Sanchez, said at the beginning of the latest episode of the podcast.\" He then added, \"This is worse than I could have imagined.\"The anger is not just about the Sixers' decision to send a talented young player to the reigning champs. It's about them ducking the luxury tax and not improving the roster for the stretch run, which is exactly what Joel Embiid said he hoped they wouldn't do.At a press conference on Friday, Morey explained the front office's side of the story. He said he understands the negative reaction, and said it was the result of people being excited about the team. He also argued that the McCain trade was the right move at the right time and that they would have been a taxpayer if the situation had called for it.'We were trying to add to the team'Morey's front office traded McCain to Oklahoma City for a 2026 first-round pick (via Houston), a 2027 second-round pick (the most favorable of OKC, Houston, Indiana and Miami's picks) and two 2028 second-round picks (OKC's own and Milwaukee's). After that, they salary-dumped Eric Gordon and signed Dominick Barlow, who'd been a major contributor on a two-way, to a standard contract. That does not mean, however, that this is all the Sixers wanted to do.\n\"Because we're playing well, we were trying to upgrade the team and add to the team now,\" Morey told reporters. \"That was goal No. 1. Obviously, no deal materialized, including using the picks we got from the Jared deal. That's why we did that move a little early. We were trying to reuse those draft picks to add now.\" Throughout the press conference, Morey reiterated that Philadelphia had tried to be a buyer. It offered the picks it got from the Thunder \"to many teams,\" he said, but was unable to turn them into a difference-making player.\"We were trying to add to the team, and we didn't find a deal that made sense, that we thought could move the needle on our ability to win this year,\" Morey said.\nThe McCain deal is fascinating, though, because the beginning of his career has been ... unusual. He was the No. 16 pick in the 2024 draft, and on opening night last season he didn't check in until garbage time. Weeks later, he was the bright spot in a Sixers season that was falling apart due to injuries. In addition to being a lethal shooter, he was thrust into a playmaking role, and he scored 20-plus points in seven straight games, establishing himself as the favorite for Rookie of the Year. Then he suffered a season-ending knee injury, and, during a workout just before this season's training camp, he suffered a thumb injury. While coming back from those injuries in Year 2, McCain has averaged just 6.6 points and shot just 38.5% from the field, fighting for minutes on a deeper, healthier roster that now includes VJ Edgecombe and Quentin Grimes. He started to find his form in late January, but, if you're against the trade -- and if you believe what he did in November 2024 is more meaningful than what he's done this season -- you could argue that Philadelphia sold low.Morey would disagree. \"I am quite confident we were selling high,\" he said. \"Obviously, time will tell.\" He added that the Sixers \"weren't looking to sell,\" but teams came to them with \"aggressive offers.\" In terms of McCain's trade value, \"the only higher point would have been during his run last season,\" Morey said.\nThe package of picks that Philadelphia received, Morey said, is more than the typical return \"for a starter-quality player on a good team.\" He did not trash McCain -- in fact, he called McCain \"a great future bet and a potential great player\" -- but argued that the team is in a better position with the picks than it was with McCain. This, and not cutting payroll, he said, was the primary reason for the trade. And while he thinks this year's draft class is a good one, it wasn't necessarily about getting another prospect, either. They could use the second-rounders to move up in the draft, he said, but they could also move that first-round pick to add a proven player.\"This just gives us more tools to make the moves that we think will help our future more than we saw Jared, who we gave up, but that's not a comment on Jared,\" Morey said. \"That's just, literally, we think, given our team, this was the right move to set us up down the road in a better way.\"Morey said that McCain's path to a bigger role in Philadelphia was \"a little muted relative to where his path could be on another team.\" In other words, if he continued to play around 17 minutes per game, how long would other teams continue to value him like a starter?\nOn a related note, Morey said that the Sixers have talked to Grimes' representation \"quite a bit\" lately, describing him as \"a tremendous fit with our other guards.\" Grimes signed the qualifying offer as a restricted free agent last summer, but Morey said they hope to re-sign him when he's an unrestricted free agent.'I took his comments to heart'Morey knows Embiid wanted the front office to do more than duck the tax at the deadline, and he's heard the criticism directed toward ownership.\"I understand the perception,\" he said. \"I hope to defeat it by finding a deal that I can go to ownership and say, 'We think this move is the right move to do for that and create the apron issues that it would create.' But I haven't been able to recommend that move yet.\"\nTo be clear, the luxury tax and the aprons are different things. Put simply, if a team goes over the first or second apron, it becomes subject to team-building restrictions. If a team goes over the luxury tax, it simply has to pay the luxury tax.Morey said that the Sixers kept their top players, Embiid obviously included, updated about moves and potential moves leading up to the deadline. \"I think we all wanted to add to the team, and I took his comments to heart,\" Morey said, insisting that the problem was not an unwillingness to be a luxury-tax team, but a lack of trade options that justified being a luxury-tax team.\"For sure, if we had found an add and we were going to end up higher, we would've ended up above it,\" Morey said. \"We've done it several times when I was here. Over the history of ownership, they've done it many times. We didn't see something that did that.\"\nPhiladelphia has two open roster spots and could still add a player in the buyout market. \"We've had a lot of conversations already,\" Morey said. It could also convert Jabari Walker's two-way to a standard contract. Morey repeatedly emphasized, though, that the Sixers are happy with the roster they have.\"We like our chances in the East,\" he said. \"We feel like we're in the mix with the top teams there. Obviously, we gotta prove that on the court, but yeah, I'm just reiterating: Yeah, we were hoping to add, and we didn't add, but we still believe in this team.\" Elsewhere in the East, the Cleveland Cavaliers effectively swapped Darius Garland, De'Andre Hunter and Lonzo Ball for James Harden, Dennis Schrôder and Keon Ellis. The Detroit Pistons effectively turned Jaden Ivey into Kevin Huerter. The New York Knicks effectively turned Guerschon Yabusele into Jose Alvarado. The Boston Celtics traded Anfernee Simons for Nikola Vučević. Without naming any of these teams specifically, Morey said he doesn't think anybody meaningfully improved its title odds.\n\"Folks have speculated on the improvements of our East competitors,\" Morey said. \"I don't see it, it personally.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At 5-foot-2, WBA featherweight champion Nick Ball is used to being at a physical disadvantage in the ring. That will be the case again on Saturday at Echo Arena in Liverpool, England, when Ball puts his title on the line against 5-foot-9 Brandon Figueroa.Ball (23-0-1, 13 KO) has become one of boxing's most active and exciting champions since defeating Ray Ford by split decision for the belt in June 2024. Ball has picked up three successful defenses of that title since the win over Ford, stopping Ronny Rios and TJ Doheny and, most recently, winning a clear decision over Sam Goodman.Ball overcomes his height with a face-first style, putting himself in his opponent's chest and unloading a constant stream of punches.\nHe'll have a willing partner in Figueroa (26-2-1, 19 KO), a former WBC junior featherweight champion. Figueroa lost that title in his first fight with Stephen Fulton, a 2021 clash that won CBS Sports' Fight of the Year.\nThe only other loss of Figueroa's career also came against Fulton, this time in February 2025 at featherweight. Figueroa rebounded from that defeat with a win over Joet Gonzalez. He is now 4-1 at 126 pounds.Should Ball get past Figueroa, he has said his sights would be set on a unification bout, with Bruce Carrington (WBC), Angelo Leo (IBF) and Rafael Espinoza (WBO) holding the other world titles at featherweight.Let's take a look at the rest of the undercard on Saturday before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nBall vs. Figueroa fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookNick Ball (c) -450 vs. Brandon Figueroa +330, WBA featherweight championshipAndrew Cain -1000 vs. Alejandro Jair Gonzalez +600, bantamweightJack Turner vs. Juan Carlos Martinez Urbina, junior bantamweightBrad Strand -1600 vs. Ruben Gonzalez +800, junior featherweightWhere to watch Ball vs. Figueroa Date: Saturday, Feb. 7 | Location: MS&S Bank Arena -- Liverpool, EnglandStart time: 2 p.m. ET (main card)Watch: DAZN (subscription required)PredictionDespite a long, lanky frame, Figueroa is a fighter who likes to come forward and work to the body. Figueroa's tendency to come forward will do some of the work for Ball of closing distance, which is always step one for someone as short as the champion. Ball has never really struggled to get inside and do good work, punching up while in the phone booth.What will decide this fight is whether Figueroa can fight against his instincts and make Ball wade through stiff jabs. If Figueroa can punish Ball on the outside, the upset is in play. Toe-to-toe, Ball has the edge, and Figueroa will have to punch down, which will make it even more difficult to do the bodywork that is a cornerstone of his offensive approach. Pick: Nick Ball via UD\n            ",

Both the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots have concluded their slate of practices and are now simply waiting to kick off Super Bowl LX on Sunday. With these on-field preparations now in the books, we also have a final look at the health statuses for both franchises as they've released their final injury reports of the week. Coming into Super Bowl week, the injury storylines surrounding both of these clubs centered on their quarterbacks. Sam Darnold had been nursing an oblique injury, while Drake Maye had been working through an injury to his right throwing shoulder. Their situations cleared up as the week progressed, but there was some concern for Seattle defensive back Nick Emmanwori, who suffered an ankle injury this week at practice. Below, we'll provide an update on Emmanwori and reveal the game statuses for both Seattle and New England.Seattle Seahawks (-4.5) at New England PatriotsSunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, streaming on PeacockTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSeahawksRobbie OuztsFBNeckQuestionablePatriotsJoshua FarmerDLHamstringQuestionableHarold LandryLBKneeQuestionableRobert SpillaneLBAnkleQuestionableSeahawks: The most notable development for Seattle is that Emmanwori carries no injury designation, meaning he will play on Super Bowl Sunday despite that ankle injury. After missing Thursday's session, Emmanwori was back in the fold Friday as a full participant. Offensive tackle Charles Cross was also upgraded to a full participant after being limited at the start of the week, so the Seahawks are quite healthy coming into this matchup. \nPatriots: New England is also pretty healthy. All eyes were fixated on Drake Maye, but the second-year quarterback opened up the week as a full participant at practice, and that remained the case through Friday. He has no injury designation, meaning he is good to go. Linebacker Robert Spillane is listed as questionable after missing Wednesday's practice and being limited on both Thursday and Friday, but has been adamant when speaking to reporters this week that he'll suit up. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        All eyes will be on Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in the Big Game. It's an unlikely matchup after the Patriots came into the season off back-to-back 4-13 seasons and hadn't been to the NFL playoffs since the 2021 season. Seattle hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2022 season, but made huge strides in the second season under head coach Mike Macdonald and quarterback Sam Darnold, a free-agent acquisition.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday, Feb. 8. The latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Seattle as the 4.5-point favorite, with the over/under at 45.5 points. The Seahawks are -238 money line favorites (risk $238 to win $100), while the Patriots are +195 underdogs. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is +115 (risk $100 to win $115) to win MVP, while Drake Maye sits second at +240. SportsLine's NFL experts teamed up to give exact score projections for the Big Game, and while they're unanimously backing the Seahawks to win, their score predictions lead to some different spread and total picks. \nThe team of NFL betting experts includes R.J. White, who is SportsLine's all-time No. 1 NFL spread expert and Larry Hartstein, who enters the game on a 43-33 run on NFL ATS picks (+596). Other NFL betting experts featured include Alex 'PropStarz' Selesnick, who is on a 62-44 (+916) roll on NFL player props and Jeff Hochman, who is 83-66-3 (plus +1217) over the past four NFL seasons.Now, SportsLine's NFL experts have analyzed the NFL odds and locked in their final score predictions for Seahawks vs. Patriots. Patriots vs. Seahawks score predictionsR.J. White Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 19, Patriots 16\"The last four Big Games have seen both teams get to 20 points, but I think there's a chance touchdowns will be hard to come by in this game. The Seahawks defense is elite, allowing just two touchdowns in the six games since Week 12 where they haven't faced the Rams. The Patriots defense has risen to that level in the postseason thanks to getting key players back in the front seven as well as playcaller Zak Kuhr putting on a masterclass each week. There's no denying the talent on these offenses, but I see two defensive units that will be tough to crack in the red zone and a lot of kicking points in this game.\" New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and target the Patriots +4.5: \nLarry Hartstein Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 16\"It's been four months since a team not named the Rams excelled offensively versus Seattle's No. 1 defense. Unless Drake Maye runs wild, I have a hard time seeing the Patriots getting to 20 points. New England's defense is stout too, with a front that shuts down the run and Christian Gonzalez patrolling the back end. But Seattle has better weapons, led by the unstoppable Jaxon-Smith Njigba. He, Rashid Shaheed and Cooper Kupp will make enough plays to complete the Sam Darnold redemption story.\" You can bet Seahawks (-4.5) at DraftKings:\nJeff HochmanBig Game score prediction: Seahawks 27, Patriots 20\"Seattle's edge in Net Yards Per Play (+1.4 vs. +1.0) is even more impressive considering they played the fourth-toughest schedule, while New England had the league's easiest. Since 2000, just four teams have captured the title with a negative sack differential, while teams with a +20 or higher sack differential -- such as Seattle -- have won six times. The Patriots' sack differential of -13 is the lowest ever for a championship team in this span. After monitoring both teams all season, Seattle appears superior in every phase: offense, defense and special teams.\" You can go Over on the total (45.5) at DraftKings:\nAlex 'PropStarz' Selesnick Big Game score prediction: Seahawks 23, Patriots 19\"This looks like a game where both offenses could find it difficult to score touchdowns. New Englands defense has been dominant through the playoffs and features the type of scheme and personnel that could potentially give Sam Darnold fits coupled with limiting Seattle's run game. I also expect Mike McDonald's defense to make life really difficult on Drake Maye who has not been same player that was a bonafide MVP candidate through the entirety of the regular season. I think this is ultimately a low scoring game decided by 4 points or less. The Seahawks have been very fortunate in high leverage situations and I do expect some major regression in the turnover department, however that may not come to fruition until next season. Seattle feels like a team of destiny.\" You can pick Under (45.5) the total at DraftKings:\nHow to get more Patriots vs. Seahawks picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Patriots 10,000 times and revealed its picks. See who wins and covers the spread here, all from the model that's on a 53-37 roll on top-rated NFL picks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA trade deadline isn't until tomorrow, but there have already been some blockbuster trades around the league. Late last night, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Clippers agreed to a trade to send James Harden to Cleveland and Darius Garland to the Clippers in a move that will have a significant postseason impact. Another big-time trade that may not have postseason effects until next year is the Memphis Grizzlies and Utah Jazz agreeing to a multi-player trade, with Jaren Jackson Jr. being the highlight piece going to Utah. With four Grizzlies players being involved in this trade, their Wednesday rotation will be significantly limited, which can lead to value opportunities for NBA player prop bets.

    "body": "\nSuper Bowl 60 will be the 10th rematch in the history of The Big Game as the New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. The Pats won their Super Bowl 49 meeting, and the winner of the first Super Bowl meeting is 6-3 all-time in the rematch. The Pats are the AFC's No. 2 seed after a 14-3 regular season and wins over the Chargers, Texans and Broncos in the 2026 NFL playoffs as New England has won six in a row overall. The Seahawks are the NFC's No. 1 seed after also going 14-3, followed by postseason victories over the 49ers and Rams, as the Seahawks are on a nine-game win streak. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. Seattle has won each of the three meetings since that Super Bowl 49 defeat. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots odds via DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Before making any Patriots vs. Seahawks picks, make sure to check out the Super Bowl 60 predictions from SportsLine NFL expert Brady Kannon.\nKannon rose to fame in 2011 when he captained a four-person team to win the Hilton NFL SuperContest (now the Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest). His team set the record for the highest winning percentage in the contest's history at the time, nailing 72.5% (58-22-5 ATS). Kannon has also crushed his recent NFL picks, going 29-15-2 (+1208) in his last 46 NFL against the spread picks. Now, Kannon has set his sights on Seahawks vs. Patriots and just locked in his picks and predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see his picks.

The 8.7 ppg allowed by the Patriots in the 2026 NFL playoffs are the fewest through three playoff games since the Super Bowl-winning 2000 Ravens. On offense, Drake Maye is the first quarterback to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason since the 1970 merger, and as a whole, the Pats finished the regular season in the top 3 in both points scored and yards gained. Additionally, the underdog has outright won in three straight Super Bowls and covered in five straight, with each of those the longest streaks in Big Game history. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverSeattle has played turnover-free ball over their last three games, and it is the only undefeated team (10-0) this season when committing 1 or fewer turnovers. Not giving the ball away keeps its No. 3 scoring offense on the field, and it's an explosive unit that leads the NFL in yards per pass completion (7.5). The other side of the ball ranks even better, topping the league, and No. 1 scoring defenses are 14-4 in the Super Bowl since 1970. The Seahawks are also the first team in a decade to rank in the top two in both yards per rush allowed (3.7, 1st) and yards per pass allowed (5.5, 2nd). In terms of the spread, Seattle is a league-best 14-5 ATS this season, as well as 8-1 versus the line away from home. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Patriots vs. Seahawks  picksKannon has analyzed Seahawks vs. Patriots from every possible angle.

    "body": "\n        February started off strong with 20 ranked women's basketball teams playing on Sunday, and the action will just continue to ramp up as the last stretch of the regular season develops. The 2025-26 campaign has been total chaos with multiple upsets, which means this month will feature plenty of matchups that could have significant consequences for the NCAA Tournament. No. 1 UConn has already played its toughest opponents and just needs to continue taking care of business in the Big East to end the regular season with a perfect record. However, there are plenty of other top-ranked teams that still have some of their most difficult challenges ahead of them. Here is a closer look at the top five matchups to watch in February:LSU at TexasFeb. 5 | Austin, Texas | 9 p.m. ET | ESPNThe SEC is the most competitive conference in the nation, and a battle between two of the top teams is a must-watch event. LSU took a 70-65 home win over Texas on Jan. 11, but now it will be the Longhorns' turn to host. Before that loss, Texas had a perfect 18-0 record, which was the program's best start since the 1985-86 season. The team then lost a close one to South Carolina, but now the Longhorns are on a three-game winning streak, including a quality win over Oklahoma. Now, the question is: Will the Longhorns keep the momentum going, or will LSU stump them again? The Tigers started conference play 0-2, but things have been clicking during their seven-game winning streak. A second win against Texas could also mean Kim Mulkey's group has a chance at potentially taking the final No. 1 seed from the Longhorns for the NCAA Tournament.Duke at LouisvilleFeb. 5 | Lexington, Kentucky | 7 p.m. ET | ESPNDuke fell off the AP Top 25 after a tough stretch in November. However, the Blue Devils have bounced back with 13 consecutive wins. This will be a key game for Kara Lawson's team to show they can compete and win against top opponents. As great as this opportunity is, Louisville won't be an easy challenge, especially in Kentucky. The Cardinals are on a 14-game winning streak that started after Louisville fell short of an upset against South Carolina in a two-point loss in December. Since then, the team has picked up some quality wins that include North Carolina, Tennessee, Notre Dame and NC State -- all at a neutral site or on the road.South Carolina at LSUFeb. 14 | Baton Rouge, Louisiana | 8:30 p.m. ET | ABCThis is another matchup that could help LSU's case for a No. 1 seed. Although South Carolina is 22-2 overall, the Gamecocks are not exactly crushing opponents every night. They have had a few upset scares, and they recently struggled to pull away from an unranked Texas A&M team until the fourth quarter. However, the Gamecocks were playing that one without Ta'Niya Latson and Ago Makeer, who are both out with leg injuries without a timetable for their return. The game will be in Baton Rouge, which should give the Tigers an edge. That being said, nothing is guaranteed in this conference and Dawn Staley's squad surely circled this one on the calendar. We also have to point out the obvious storyline of MiLaysia Fulwiley transferring from South Carolina to LSU in the summer. Just like she did with the Gamecocks, Fulwiley has been a key part of LSU's bench leading the nation in scoring with her energy and athleticism.\nUCLA at MichiganFeb. 8 |  | Ann Arbon, Michigan | 3 p.m. ET | ABCThe Bruins have one of the toughest strengths of schedule this season and have handled it nicely with a 21-1 overall record. They recently dismantled Iowa, which further helped their case as the top team in the Big Ten. However, Cori Close's squad can't get too comfortable in a road game against Michigan, the No. 2 team in the conference standings. The Wolverines know how to rise to the occasion when playing tough opponents, as they showed when they almost upset No. 1 UConn at the Wall of Fame Women's Showcase in November. They are also fresh off a gritty overtime victory over Michigan State on the road, which should help the Wolverines' confidence coming into this game – assuming they don't slip against Nebraska on Wednesday.TCU at Baylor Feb. 12 | Waco, Texas | 7 p.m. ET | ESPNBaylor's recent loss to West Virginia was yet another example of how messy the Big 12 is right now. The same goes for TCU falling to Texas Tech. According to CBS Sports bracketologist Connor Groel, both are hovering around the hosting cutoff for the NCAA Tournament, which means every win matters a little more right now. They faced each other in the Big 12 title game last season as the top two seeds, and TCU won by just five points. Now here they are again trying to figure out who rules the conference. This will be the first time they meet this season, and what adds to the intrigue is the fact that they will also be playing their last conference game on March 1 against each other.Honorable mentions:Texas at Vanderbilt — Feb. 12 at 7:30 p.m. ET on the SEC NetworkMichigan State at Michigan — Feb. 15, at 4 p.m. ET on FS1Baylor at Texas Tech — Feb. 18 at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN+\nMichigan at Iowa — Feb. 22, TBD\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Earlier this week, CBS Sports published our annual list of the top 100 prospects in baseball. Today, we're spinning off that idea by answering an obvious question: which youngsters do we envision improving their stock most during the season?Below, you'll find five of our favorite candidates. To be considered for this piece, the player in question must not have made their respective division's top 20 list. This is not, in other words, a collection of prospects who are already highly regarded and just need the benefit of added exposure. The five players we're highlighting have questions to answer about their games -- questions we feel they have a reasonable chance of answering in a positive manner.\n        \n            \n                Ranking the top 100 MLB prospects: Kevin McGonigle, Jesús Made, Konnor Griffin lead top young talent\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDo note the players are presented in alphabetical order.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Bryce Cunningham, RHP, YankeesCunningham sported a 2.14 ERA through his first seven outings of 2025 before requiring several weeks on the shelf with an undisclosed injury. He returned for a single appearance in June before going back on the IL, this time for two more months. Cunningham made a series of brief starts late in the year and then had a woeful stint in the Arizona Fall League. It stands to reason that the layoff was a factor in his performance. Whatever the case, he's a physical right-hander with a riding fastball that cuts more than expected and an unusual high-spin changeup. If Cunningham can stay healthy, he could be in for a breakout season -- a full one, this time.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. A.J. Ewing, CF/2B, MetsEwing batted .315/.401/.429 last season across three levels, and he did it while 1) stealing 70 bases and 2) receiving double-digit starts at each outfield spot and at second base. Predictably, his game is built around singles, walks, and secondary value. Ewing's maximum exit velocity in the publicly available data was around 109 mph, putting him on the low-end for quantifiable strength. His ground ball rate also spiked after he was promoted to Double-A. Was that a small sample effect or a sign that his power will play down against better pitching? If Ewing provides the right answer, he'll go a long way in easing any concerns about his offense -- and, in turn, lift his national perception.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Dasan Hill, LHP, TwinsHill is a gangly lefty who compiled a 3.19 ERA and a 2.08 strikeout-to-walk ratio in his first 19 professional starts. Despite his 6-foot-5 frame, he takes a short stride that results in a steeper angle on his pitches than the average bear. Hill has a quality changeup and he's shown a feel for spinning the ball. He does need to throw more strikes and he looks like a candidate to throw his sweeping slider harder. Hill chucked it in the low 80s last season despite having the kind of arm strength required to sit around 96 mph with his heater. Gains on those fronts will send his stock soaring.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Luke Sinnard, RHP, BravesSinnard is a power forward-sized right-hander who followed up a strong regular season across A-ball affiliates by punching out 20 batters in 15 Arizona Fall League innings. He's exhibited surprising control for a big pitcher and he's done it while adding weapons to his arsenal, including a low-spin splitter that tore up AFL competition. Sinnard also benefits from an outlier launch point: his nearly 83-inch release height would've ranked second among MLB pitchers, behind only Justin Verlander. A strong showing in Double-A will gain him more believers. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Gage Stanifer, RHP, Blue JaysStanifer has one of the most compact deliveries in the game. He uses that operation to fire mid-90s sinkers, a gyro breaking ball that induced whiffs on nearly 60% of the swings taken against it during his time in the Florida State League, and a changeup with ample separation. The catch with Stanifer is his command. The sinker is the pitch that finds the zone most often in MLB, but Stanifer struggled to reliably locate his. In turn, he walked more than a batter every other inning. His arsenal is good enough to land him a big-league role of some kind or another in the next 18 months. \n            ",

    "body": "\nManchester City and Newcastle meet in the second leg of their EFL Cup semifinal tie with the Citizens holding a 2-0 goal edge on aggregate. Man City slipped up in Premier League play on Sunday with a 2-2 draw against Tottenham, while Newcastle slipped to 11th in the standings after a 4-1 defeat at the hands of Liverpool. The Magpies are now eight points out of a top-4 spot and City's pursuit of Arsenal hasn't gained much traction, so this competition suddenly takes on more meaning with a trophy on the line.Kickoff from Etihad Stadium in Manchester is set for 3 p.m. ET and soccer fans can stream the match on Paramount+. Manchester City are -130 favorites (wager $130 to win $100) in the latest Manchester City vs. Newcastle odds at DraftKings Sportsbook while Newcastle are +290 underdogs (wager $100 to win $290). A draw comes in at +290 and the total is 3.5 (Over +135, Under -175).

It's very important to remember this is a two leg competition, which means the result of the first leg does affect how teams will play in this second leg. The first leg saw Manchester City travel to St. James Park and win 2-0 on the road. That means that going into this second leg, City are already up 2-0 in aggregate scoring. If Man City were to lose 1-0 or 2-1 in this match, they'd still advance to the final. City doesn't need to win this second leg to advance. This also means that Newcastle have to press like mad and try to overcome a multi-goal deficit. Newcastle can't afford to sit back and play defense here.Newcastle have a horrid history at Etihad StadiumNewcastle will be desperate to find goals to try to catch up to the Citizens, who are already up two goals. While on paper they should be good enough to find goals with strikers like Aaron Gordon, Harvey Barnes and Nick Woltemade, we have to remember there's a psychological edge in this matchup.Newcastle have been terrible traveling to Manchester over the past few years. Newcastle have not scored, at all, in their last seven trips to Etihad stadium. All seven of those matches ended with Manchester City winning to nil. This might change as City's defense has been a bit lackluster as of late but with Newcastle being forced to press, I expect City to score multiple times off a counterattack.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Whenever the New England Patriots or Seattle Seahawks kick the ball away to the opposition during Super Bowl LX, they'll do so with bated breath. That's due to this title match featuring two of the best returners that the NFL has to offer in Seattle's Rashid Shaheed and New England's Marcus Jones. As we've seen at various points this year, both returners can change the game in the blink of an eye. In the case of Shaheed, he got Seattle's postseason rolling right out of the gate with a 95-yard return for a touchdown on the opening kickoff. Meanwhile, Jones earned second-team All-Pro honors this season for his return ability. Because we're looking at two elite figures in the return game, it's worth putting on the radar something that has NEVER been done in the history of the Super Bowl: A punt returned for a touchdown. \n        \n            \n                Madden NFL 26 Super Bowl 2026 simulation: Seahawks and Patriots are in for another instant classic\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"None? Are you serious?\" Shaheed exclaimed to CBS Sports when informed that this has yet to happen. \"That does get me excited. That means that my name could be etched in history.\" \n\"I just got educated about that,\" Jones said when broached with the same possibility of being the first player to ever return a punt for a touchdown in the Super Bowl. \"If that happens, man, I would love to take advantage of the opportunity and end up making history with that. Of course, any time I'm back there I'm always trying to make the best decision first off, and then also whenever I do get the ball and am able to return, I'm trying to score.\" Again, because we have these two specific players on either side of the return game, history could very well be made. This season, Jones has returned two punts for a touchdown, including a 94-yard return against the New York Giants back in Week 13. \n\"He's a problem, man,\" Shaheed said of Jones. \"Any time he gets the ball in his hands, coaches kind of get to clutching. He's a special player anytime he gets the ball in his hands, punt returner, kick return. Hopefully, we've got a good plan, got to keep the ball away from him.\"\nAs for Shaheed, he has three total returns for a touchdown (kickoff and punt) over the regular season and postseason. His lone punt return touchdown came against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 16 that helped them inch one step closer to eventually locking up the No. 1 seed. \n\"Oh yeah, he's a great returner,\" Jones said of Shaheed's skills in that area of the game. \"He's able to get around up the field and also hit the seams and get vertical.\"If we expand this to include kickoff returns as well, Shaheed comes into this Super Bowl with three return touchdowns this year (regular season and postseason). That makes him just the seventh player in the last 50 years to enter the Super Bowl with three or more kickoff/punt return touchdowns. Three of the previous six had a return TD in the Super Bowl (both on kickoffs). \nSo, let this be your warning: Pay close attention to special teams this Super Bowl and don't use an ensuing kick for your opportunity to refresh your beverage or get more dip out of the fridge. You may miss the most exciting moment of the evening. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are the main attraction, but the roster of singers on Super Bowl Sunday are all stars in their own right. In addition to the announcement of Bad Bunny being named the featured halftime performer months ago, we know that Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones have been added to the list of singers for the big game on Sunday, February 8.The pregame entertainment will come ahead of the 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff on NBC and Peacock at Levi's Stadium, and the halftime show will be after 30 minutes of play.\"Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them -- alongside our extraordinary deaf performers -- on Super Bowl LX's world stage,\" said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. \"This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.\" The Bad Bunny announcement followed months of rumors and predictions, and was made in a subtle way back at the end of September. Headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the top singing gigs of the year, and this was how the 31-year-old singer made the announcement on social media. \nThe Puerto Rican singer is the most-streamed artist in the world. Bad Bunny has 16 Grammy nominations, with six wins. His first three Grammy wins were for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album for YHLQMDLG, Best Musica Urbana Album for El Último Tour Del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti. He also took home one of the biggest awards, Album of the Year, at last week's Grammys for DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS. It was the first Spanish-language album to win the award.Some of his other awards include the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist, the BET Award for Single of the Year for his hit song \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and J Balvin and Billboard Top Latin.Bad Bunny's top songs are \"Vete,\" \"Titi Me Pregunto,\" \"Que Pasaria\" and \"BAILE INoLIDABLE.\" \nUsually the special guests are announced closer to the championship game. One early guess for a special guest is Cardi B, who is also connected to the NFL because she recently gave birth to a boy, the son of Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs. Rapper Kendrick Lamar, who brought out multiple special guests including SZA and Serena Williams, was last year's headliner. Some other iconic halftime performers include Prince, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few. The halftime show become a cultural moment for the masses as it is typically the most-watched performance of the year. Here's a look at who will perform each pregame song on Sunday:\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"Charlie Puth and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the national anthem ahead of the big game. Puth is a multi-award winning and multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer. His hits include \"See You Again,\" \"Attention\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore.\" Beam is a actor, dancer, poet, educator, choreographer, director and visual artist.\n\"America the Beautiful\"Brandi Carlile and Deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will perform \"America the Beautiful.\" Carlile has an impressive resume that includes an Oscar nomination, two Emmy wins and a book that reached No. 1 on The New York Times' bestsellers list. \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" will be performed by Coco Jones and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam. Jones has quickly made a name for herself in R&B music, with eight Grammy nominations. Her hit \"ICU\" is platinum certified. She is an actress as well as a musician.The 60th edition of the Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, on NBC. The backdrop of the game and performances will be Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are knocking on the door of Super Bowl LX, and the anticipation is palpable. When it comes to the lead-up to a given Super Bowl, the two-week hiatus between games can oftentimes be excruciating for fans who cannot wait for this game to unfold and a champion to be crowned. This year, it'll either be the Seattle Seahawks in the winner's circle and Sam Darnold completing his career resurrection, or it'll be Drake Maye kicking off a new era for the New England Patriots and claiming a championship in just his second season. While we sit around and wait for this game to arrive, how about we let the video game gods give us a little preview of what may be to come? As we've done for the past few years, we've loaded up the latest edition of Madden NFL, set the difficulty to All-Madden, clocked it to 10-minute quarters, and put the two Super Bowl contenders against one another. If you've followed these in years past, you know not to take this simulation lightly, even if it is a video game. Coming into Super Bowl LX, this simulation has picked the correct winner in four of the past five Super Bowls, including the Philadelphia Eagles defeating the Kansas City Chiefs a year ago. For the Seahawks, they'll hope that streak continues as they were able to pull off a thrilling 23-20 victory over the Patriots to claim the Super Bowl LX title in this simulation. \nAt the start, it looked like Sam Darnold was regressing to his ghost-seeing days with the New York Jets as he was sacked five times throughout the first half. That included three in the first quarter that limited the Seattle offense to a mere field goal. Fortunately for Darnold, the Seattle defense was able to keep New England in check as they simply traded field goals over the opening period. Things did start to open up in the second quarter, with the Patriots taking a 10-3 lead thanks to Kayshon Boutte reeling in a diving 12-yard touchdown reception from Maye. Seattle then took possession and, aided by a defensive pass interference call on New England corner Marcus Jones, found itself in position to even the game at 10 apiece with the ball inside the red zone. Despite the penalty putting their backs against the wall, the Patriots unit held firm, giving Mike Macdonald a decision on fourth down. The Seahawks head coach elected to be aggressive and keep his offense on the field on fourth-and-3, but he was not rewarded. Darnold was sacked for the fifth time on the half, and this takedown also turned the ball over on downs and eliminated a scoring opportunity. \nThat momentarily took the wind out of Seattle's sails, but they'd bounce back. After New England punted on its next possession, Darnold led a touchdown drive right before the half, firing an 11-yard pass over the middle to Cooper Kupp to knot the game at 10 at the break. The tie was quickly broken within the opening minute of the third quarter as Maye connected with tight end Hunter Henry over the middle of the field for a thunderous 64-yard touchdown reception. That touchdown by Henry felt like it was going to be the defining moment of Super Bowl LX, particularly after the New England defense held Seattle to a field goal on its next possession and kicker Andy Borregales netted a field goal of his own to push the Patriots back up by a touchdown, 20-13, entering the fourth quarter. \nHowever, the final frame proved to be where the Seahawks made a championship comeback. At the 5:55 mark of the fourth quarter, Darnold and Kupp connected for their second and most impressive touchdown of the night, as the quarterback lofted the ball to the front corner of the end zone on third-and-2 to tie the game at 20. From there, it was Seattle's defense that started to turn up the volume against the Patriots' offense. New England's best chance to get back out in front came at the 3:21 mark of the fourth quarter. They were able to get the ball to the Seattle 41-yard line, but could not move the chains. Seahawks corner Tariq Woolen broke up a sideline pass from Maye to Boutte that would've resulted in a first down. Instead, the Patriots punted the ball away. Darnold then took possession and began a clock-bleeding drive that took the offense to the Patriots 3-yard line. There, Macdonald sent out Jason Myers, who nailed the go-ahead chip-shot field goal with less than 25 seconds left to playin regulation. \nMaye and the Patriots offense would get the ball back at their own 24-yard line, just 20 seconds left on the clock, and no timeouts. After moving the ball momentarily, defensive tackle Leonard Williams shut the game down with a sack on Maye to end the game. Go crazy, Seattle! The Seahawks are Super Bowl LX champions! If the actual Super Bowl LX is half as exciting as this Madden NFL 26 simulation, we're in for another instant classic between these two franchises. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Who would've thought that a child's toy would've been the inspiration for the name of the greatest spectacle in professional sports? It's safe to say that not even Lamar Hunt, the man who is credited with coining the \"Super Bowl\" name, could have thought that his idea -- let alone the game itself -- would become the cultural phenomenon that it is today.   Hunt's foray into professional sports had a humble beginning. He had tried and failed twice to acquire an NFL team, and that's when he decided to do the unthinkable: create a brand new football league that would one day compete with the league that spurned him. Hunt's goal, however, was not payback. The goal of Hunt's league -- the American Football League -- was to create a more exciting brand of football while tailoring rules to help the offenses (sound familiar?).  After several lean years, the AFL quickly established itself as a more fun, entertaining alternative to the more traditional NFL. Not only did AFL games include higher point totals, they also included colorful jerseys (to help reel in young fans) and just as colorful personalities that included Chiefs coach Hank Stram and Jets quarterback Joe Namath. Along with Namath, the league possessed several household names that included Jack Kemp (who quarterbacked the Bills to two AFL titles while appearing in four straight AFL title games) and Chargers receiver Lance Alworth, whose career earned him a spot in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Over time, the league thought it was ready to compete with the mighty NFL, and before the start of the 1966 season, Hunt, who was also the owner of the Chiefs, penned a letter to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle to see if the NFL champion would care to face his league's champion once their own championship game had concluded.  \n\"If possible, I believe we should 'coin a phrase' for the Championship Game,\" Hunt wrote, according to Michael MacCambridge's book, \"America's Game.\" \"I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon.\"  Rozelle, according to former NFL publicity director Don Weiss, did not love the nickname. It's been reported that Rozelle would have called the game the Pro Bowl if that wasn't already the name of the league's all-star game.  \"Pete was a pretty regular person, but he was a stickler on words and grammar, and 'super' was not his idea of a good word,\" Weiss said. \"He thought 'super' was a word like 'neat' or 'gee-whiz.' It had no sophistication.\"  \nWhen no other ideas came to light, Rozelle and Hunt settled on the first game between the two leagues being branded as the \"AFL-NFL Championship Game.\" While he didn't know it at the time, Hunt (pictured here with Chiefs coach Hank Stram and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle prior to the start of Super Bowl I) played a crucial role in what ultimately became the biggest spectacle in sports.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Rozelle wasn't the only one who didn't love Hunt's \"Super Bowl\" nickname. Before pitching the name to Rozelle in his note, Hunt initially mentioned it during a meeting with the other AFL team owners when trying to decide if there should be one or two weeks between the leagues' respective title games and the AFL-NFL Championship Game. While no one directly shot down Hunt's idea, the name Super Bowl was received with chuckles by the other owners.  \"Nobody ever said, 'Let's make that the name of the game,'\" Hunt recalled in MacCambridge's book. \"Far from it, we all agreed it was far too corny to be the name of the new title game.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026 casual fan's guide: Everything to know for Patriots vs. Seahawks\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt this point in the story, there are a few questions that need answered. Where did Hunt's \"Super Bowl\" idea come from? And how did the AFL-NFL Championship Game get renamed to the Super Bowl after it was mocked by AFL owners and rejected by Rozelle?The answer to the first question can be traced back to a kid's toy that was played with by Hunt's children during the mid '60s. One day, Hunt saw his kids playing with a Superball, a \"mystery ball with 1,000 bounces\" that was branded as \"the greatest ball ever created.\"  While the AFL-NFL Championship Game was the official name for the 1967 game played between the AFL champion Chiefs and the NFL champion Packers, the game was often referred to in the media as \"the World Series of football.\" But while that nickname never gained momentum with the general public, several players and media members had begun to use Hunt's \"Super Bowl\" nickname when publicly talking about the AFL-NFL title game. In fact, NFL Films, during their coverage of Green Bay's 35-10 victory, referred to it as the \"Super Bowl.\" \nOver the next year, the phrase \"Super Bowl\" spread like wildfire, as fans, players, media circuits and national commentators had starting using Hunt's phrase on a regular basis. Following the second AFL vs. NFL installment, another blowout victory by Vince Lombardi's Packers (this time over Al Davis' Raiders), the leagues decided to officially use Hunt's nickname as the official name of the AFL-NFL matchup.  Super Bowl III, played in January of 1969, was the first AFL-NFL game that was officially dubbed as the Super Bowl. Fittingly, the third installment of his annual game would break the mold while helping make the Super Bowl the spectacle that it is today. Despite being 18-point underdogs to Don Shula's heavily favored Colts heading into the game, Namath famously guaranteed a victory for his Jets. With more hype surrounding this Super Bowl than the previous two combined, Namath, in front of a packed house at Miami's fabled Orange Bowl, helped lead the Jets to a shocking upset that exponentially increased the popularity of the NFL and Super Bowl while also providing instant validation for Hunt and the AFL.  \nA year later, the AFL and NFL agreed to merge following the 1969 season, meaning that the fourth installment of the Super Bowl would be the final game ever played between the two leagues. A year after watching the Jets become the first AFL team to defeat the NFL, Hunt looked on with pride as his Chiefs pulled off their own upset in Super Bowl IV, defeating the Vikings, a 13-point favorite, 23-7 to even the AFL's record with the NFL at two wins apiece.  \nWhile the Super Bowl trophy has been named after Lombardi, the AFC Championship trophy has been named after Hunt, one of the most influential figures in the history of professional football. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final Top247 for the 2026 recruiting class dropped Monday, featuring major movement among the 32 five-star prospects -- including four new blue-chips cracking the top echelon. Eight programs landed multiple five-star prospects while 12 others secured at least one.The impact of NIL on the high school recruiting landscape couldn't be clearer. Five years ago, three programs dominated the top talent, each landing four or more five-stars: Alabama (seven), Ohio State (five), and Georgiav(four). In the 2026 class, no program secured more than three five-stars. Meanwhile, 20 programs signed at least one five-star — compared to just 14 in the 2021 class.Although the usual suspects, including the Crimson Tide and Buckeyes, got theirs, recruiting power appears to be shifting. The Bulldogs finished with their worst class in a decade while the program that landed the No. 1 class hadn't had a top five finish since 2018.Here is where all 32 five-star recruits in the 2026 class landed, led by the programs with the most blue-chip commitments.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    USC (3)247Sports five-star commitments: OT Keenyi Pepe (No. 5 overall), EDGE Luke Wafle (No. 7), DL Jaimeon Winfield (No. 30)Class ranking: No. 1USC hadn't signed a top five recruiting class since 2018, but officially snapped that streak this offseason with the No. 1-ranked haul for 2026.Pepe is the first recruit ranked in the top five of the final Top247 to sign with USC since 2021 — and just the second in the last 10 classes for the Trojans.\nWafle was among the biggest risers during Monday's update, soaring 63 spots to No. 7 overall.

Czech Republic        19. Brazil        18. Chinese Taipei        17. Nicaragua          16. Great Britain        \nWith all due respect, these five clubs aren't serious WBC title contenders. They're growing the game in their home countries and that's a great thing, though they are short on talent. Great Britain is expected to have Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Harry Ford on their roster, making them the most talented club in this tier. Props to the Czech Republic for their stunning win over China in 2023. That clinched them a spot in the 2026 WBC. Brazil, Chinese Taipei, and Nicaragua all secured WBC spots via last year's qualifying events.        The longshots        15. Australia        14. Panama          13. Colombia        12. Netherlands        11. Israel        Australia will be led by Guardians prospect Travis Bazzana, the No. 1 pick in the 2024 Draft, and Panama can send Ariel Jurado to the mound a few times. He's been one of the top pitchers in Korea the last three years. An upset loss to Great Britain in 2023 forced Colombia to go through last year's qualifying event to secure a spot in the 2026 WBC. Veterans Jose Quintana and Julio Teheran give them a credible rotation, though they lack offense.         \nThe Netherlands is one of the most fun and energetic teams every WBC. They just don't have the pitching to support a lineup that includes Ozzie Albies, Xander Bogaerts, and Ceddanne Rafaela. At least we'll get to say \"Honkbal Hoofdklasse\" for a few days. That's the highest level of professional baseball in the Netherlands. Depending on their final roster, Israel has a case for being in the next tier in these rankings, though their 2023 showing underwhelmed. The five teams here have enough talent to be a headache and win some games, but not enough to win the whole thing.                The sleepers        10. Cuba        Cuba's international baseball dominance has waned in recent years. They didn't even qualify for the 2020 Olympics, and their fourth place finish in the 2023 WBC was their best since being the runner-up in 2006. Cuba's roster tends to be laden with international competition veterans, and that seasoning is the kind of thing that can separate them from the other teams in this tier.         9. Italy        Jac Caglianone, Sal Frelick, Vinnie Pasquantino, and Kyle Teel will form a competitive lineup and Aaron Nola gives Italy the best starting pitcher they've ever had in the WBC (sorry, 2023 Matt Harvey). They have some bona fide MLB-caliber relievers in Adam Ottavino and Greg Weissert too. That can go a long way to advancing out of pool play and into the quarterfinals.        \n8. Korea        Korea has failed to make it out of pool play in the last three WBCs after finishing as the runner-up in 2009. That's three straight disappointing finishes for a team that draws players from what is widely considered the third-best professional baseball league in the world. That said, what happened in 2013, 2017, and 2023 doesn't matter. Korea has the talent to make a run in 2026. Korea Baseball Organization stars Do Yeong Kim and Ja Wook Koo will join Giants outfielder Jung Hoo Lee in the lineup.         7. Canada        No Freddie Freeman is a blow, but you can do a lot worse than building your offense around Owen Caissie, Tyler O'Neill, and Josh Naylor. Cal Quantrill, Michael Soroka, and Jameson Taillon make up the best rotation you'll find in this tier, at least on paper. The bullpen has been Canada's downfall as much as anything in past WBCs, and bullpens are inherently volatile. Get some better than expected relief work and Canada could reach the quarterfinals for the first time.        6. Puerto Rico        Insurance issues threaten to greatly diminish Puerto Rico's roster, which is a shame because Pool A will be played in San Juan. José Berríos, Carlos Correa, and Francisco Lindor are all out of the WBC for the time being. Still, Riley Greene and Heliot Ramos make for a nice offense, and Seth Lugo and Yankees top pitching prospect Elmer Rodríguez give Puerto Rico solid rotation options. Edwin Díaz, despite his season-ending knee injury in the 2023 WBC, is back to handle closing duties.        \n        The top contenders        5. Mexico        Mexico was the third-place finisher in 2023, when they lost a one-run game to Japan in the semifinals, and they might have their strongest roster yet in 2026. Alejandro Kirk will join holdovers Jonathan Aranda, Randy Arozarena, Jarren Duran, and Isaac Paredes in the lineup. Cody Ponce, who signed a $30 million contract with the Blue Jays this offseason after dominating in Korea last year, is expected to headline the rotation. Mexico will draw from enough MLB- and Triple A-caliber arms that they should be able to build a quality pitching staff. This will again be a dangerous team in the WBC.          4. Venezuela        The Wilyer Abreu/Ronald Acuña Jr./Jackson Chourio outfield will be one of the best in the WBC, and the offense is also expected to feature Maikel Garcia, Salvador Perez, and Eugenio Suárez. Ranger Suárez joining Pablo López in the rotation will give Venezuela its best 1-2 punch since the days of Freddy Garcia and Johan Santana. The bullpen might be a little iffy, but that goes for a lot of teams in the WBC. Venezuela went 4-0 in pool play in 2023 and outscored their opponents 23-9. It took Trea Turner's dramatic eighth-inning grand slam to send Venezuela home in the quarterfinals. They are very much a threat to win in 2026.        3. Dominican Republic        Going 2-2 and not making it out of pool play in 2023 was, frankly, embarrassing for a team with this much talent. I have a hard time seeing the same outcome in 2026. Not with Brayan Bello and Cristopher Sánchez joining Sandy Alcantara in the rotation. The offense reads like an All-Star Game lineup: Junior Caminero, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Manny Machado, Ketel Marte, Geraldo Perdomo, Julio Rodríguez, Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis Jr., and more. This is a supremely talented roster and the players presumably have a chip on their shoulder after the quick 2023 exit. A force, the Dominican Republic will be.        \n2. Japan        Japan ran the table in 2023, going 7-0 and outscoring their opponents 56-18 en route to winning their third WBC title (also 2006 and 2009). Seiya Suzuki will join the 2026 roster after having to withdraw from the 2023 event with an oblique injury. Shohei Ohtani won't pitch, but he will hit, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto will front the rotation. Infielder Teruaki Sato, outfielder Shota Morishita, and righty Hiromi Ito are three of the best players in the world outside MLB. Japan has never finished lower than third in the WBC. They will again go into the tournament as one of the favorites to win.        1. United States        USA was one swing away from upsetting Japan and winning the 2023 WBC. As strong as their roster was that year, it does not compare to the 2026 team. The 2023 rotation was Merrill Kelly, Lance Lynn, Nick Martinez, and late career Adam Wainwright. This year, they'll have Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal, plus Joe Ryan and Logan Webb. I'm not sure there's a wrong way to order Corbin Carroll, Bryce Harper, Aaron Judge, Cal Raleigh, Kyle Schwarber, Bobby Witt Jr. et al offensively. This is, not by a small margin, the best roster USA has ever taken in the WBC. Now they just have to go out and win the thing.        \n            ",

Some people come for the game day snacks and stay for the Super Bowl halftime show, which is historically the most-watched musical performance of the year.The halftime show has been headlined by some of the biggest artists of all-time and has brought us wild and iconic moments throughout the 60 year history of the Super Bowl. This year it will be Bad Bunny headlining, taking the stage at Levi's Stadium in Santa, Clara, California on Sunday, February 8. He has yet to announce any special guests, but often the performances have them. Some have speculated that rapper Cardi B, who he has the hit song \"I Like It\" with and is also dating Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, could join him.The three-time Grammy winner and the most-streamed artist in the world was announced as the headliner earlier this season.Last year during the big game, Kendrick Lamar took the stage in New Orleans. In 2024, Usher took the stage in Las Vegas. In 2023, Rihanna took the stage at State Farm Stadium during Super Bowl LVII. Before that, five performers took the stage for Super Bowl LVI in Los Angeles: Eminem, Dr. Dre. Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J. Blige performed halfway through the Rams win over the Bengals. \n\n        \n            \n                Ranking top-10 Super Bowl halftime performances of all-time: Here are the most iconic and memorable moments\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFor the artists who play the halftime show at the Super Bowl, they're entertaining an audience that is exponentially bigger than any they've ever encountered. It was not always like that however. So, what were the shows like before they were must-see television? Do you remember that killer halftime show featuring the Rockettes, Chubby Checker and the 88 grand pianos in 1988? Do you remember the captivating \"Be Bop Bamboozled\" at the Orange Bowl in 1989? No, no you do not. Ditto Carol Channing (twice) or any one of those four annoyingly contrived Up With People performances in the late '70s and early '80s.The Super Bowl halftime show, before Michael Jackson, was an endless wasteland of college marching bands and maddening flag-spinning tributes, from salutes to Hollywood (twice), to Motown, to the Big Band Era, to the Caribbean, to Duke Ellington. We also got the New Kids on the Block (1991) not singing any of their biggest hits and Gloria Estefan (1992) providing the soundtrack for Olympic figure skaters Dorothy Hamill and Brian Boitano of \"What would Brian Boitano do?\" fame, because nothing says a Minnesota Super Bowl like the lead singer of the Miami Sound Machine.Then we got the King of Pop at the Rose Bowl in 1993 -- and the Super Bowl halftime show was never the same again.\nHere is the complete list of previous Super Bowl halftime performers and themes:2026: Bad Bunny2025: Kendrick Lamar with special guest SZA2024: Usher with special guests Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris2023: Rihanna2022: Eminem, Dr. Dre.

    "body": "\n        When Solomon Thomas wanted to reveal his college commitment in 2014, a hat didn't feel quite right. Known for his wide frame around Coppell High School in Texas, Thomas was never really a hat person. Thomas ranked as the No. 41 player in the class and was heavily pursued by Stanford and Arkansas. After seeing close friends and competitors announce their decisions during celebratory National Signing Day events, he decided to do the same as he committed to the Cardinal. His mom had a little fern tree that seemed to perfectly play into the unofficial mascot for Stanford football. Flanked by his parents, Thomas pulled out the tree and a pair of glasses with tape in the middle to commit to \"Nerd Nation.\" The signing day gimmick went viral as Thomas inked his football letter of intent alongside eight of his closest friends with offers from Yale to Grand View. \"It was a really cool moment,\" said Thomas, now a defensive lineman with the Dallas Cowboys. \"Afterwards, being in the gym with all the guys who I played football with at Coppell who were such close friends with me, we were so proud of each other taking that next step.\" \nFor decades, National Signing Day was one of the premier events in college football. Each February, hundreds of players would ink their signatures on a National Letter of Intent and coaching staffs around the country would breathe a sigh of relief. The stories from days past have become legendary. There's the case of the late Alex Collins, whose mother refused to sign his NLI to Arkansas because she wanted him to go to Miami. Landon Collins committed to Alabama, only for his mom to say he made a mistake and should have picked LSU. Then, there's Jimmy Clausen committing to Notre Dame after stepping out of a Hummer Limo at the College Football Hall of Fame. There are still fun commitments and antics in high school recruiting. But in recent years, February signing day has become an afterthought. There's no wall-to-wall recruiting coverage or last-minute pushes after the season anymore. \nOne longtime recruiting staffer said that the focus has shifted so much that he wasn't even sure when the February signing day was. The answer when we talked? This week.\"I don't even remember,\" he said. \"That tells you how much it matters to us right now.\"The main culprit in the death of February signing day is obvious. Nearly a decade ago, the NCAA approved an early signing period in December. Instead of having to wait until February, players were allowed to lock in earlier. \n\"My thing is, I don't think it's the death of signing day because the one in December was crazy this year,\" 247Sports national analyst Brian Dohn said. \"It's just not what it used to be in February because all of the craziness that happened in December used to happen now.\" \n        \n            \n                USC inks No. 1 recruiting class in 2026, a first for non-SEC school in modern era: Here are top 5 classes\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt the time, many thought that the early signing period would allow teams to lock up their top commitments ahead of time. Mid-sized schools were eager to lock their commitments in so that bigger schools couldn't simply pivot to their players late to fill out their classes. Instead, it sped up the entire recruiting calendar. Take USC's top-ranked high school signing class, for example, the first non-SEC No. 1 class since 2008. Top recruit Keenyi Pepe committed on May 1, 2025. Five-star edge Luke Wafle joined in June. Fellow five-star defensive lineman Jaimeon Winfield committed in March. \nAs National Signing Day rolls around on Wednesday, 246 out of the Top247 players had both committed and signed with their schools. The only exception was defensive lineman Dylan Berymon, who was seemingly nudged out of a commitment to Texas in November. Kentucky and Nebraska have been fighting for his services. The only other major uncommitted players outside the Top247 are also those who faced extenuating circumstances. Four-star cornerback Andre Clarke Jr. committed to Michigan, but opted to re-open his recruitment after the Sherrone Moore debacle. Last month, he committed to Kentucky. Edge rusher Elijah Reeder faced a similar situation after Iowa State coach Matt Campbell left for Penn State; he is expected to follow Campbell to State College. The pace also hurts late risers in recruiting classes. In the state of Texas, high school state championships don't even take place until two weeks after the early signing period. While a deep run could come with more attention and offers in previous years, classes are already all but complete by then. \n\"It's completely different than when I was back in high school,\" Thomas said. \"Kids start committing when they're sophomores or juniors. When I was in school, most guys didn't commit until their senior season. It's a little bit harder for the late bloomers.\" In previous years, January was a battle royale to finalize classes. With the earlier signing day, suddenly, the January in-home visits are juniors instead. There's no final sprint for coaching staffs because many are planning for conference title games or the College Football Playoff. And as a result, official visits get moved into the spring and commitments follow. \"You don't have time to do all this stuff,\" Dohn said. \"You don't have four coaches going to visit a kid and sitting in the house for three hours when they're supposed to be there for 1.5 because they have games instead. Everything has sped up and changed.\" \nThe benefits of finishing a class are obvious, from locking in talent to planning for later cycles. That's only been exacerbated by the one-time transfer window, a two-week period at the beginning of January that went into effect this year.\"You're trying to get everyone admitted here before the spring,\" one ACC personnel director told CBS Sports. \"Before, you would have a good amount of prospects, but there's much more of a push to have everyone there for spring ball.\" Spring football has always been a draw for high-level prospects to integrate quicker before the season, but now it's a near-prerequisite. Take USC's top-ranked class again. Out of 35 commitments in the class, 32 are expected to enroll early. Especially in a world where transfers can fill roster spots with ease, there's even more pressure for underclassmen to arrive and prove they can play as freshmen. \nEven at the Group of Six level, long-term planning for individual players has never been more difficult. Waiting until June is becoming harder to stomach. \"Getting them in when you have six or seven months to work with them helps a lot on the learning side,\" one Group of Six personnel director told CBS Sports. \"To us, everyone is on six-month deals. Freshmen that come in, we expect them to contribute right off the bat because you never know if they're going to hit the portal next year.\" Granted, there are still major commitment events across college football. When Aidan Mizell committed to Florida in the Class of 2023, he did it by bringing out live alligators in front of a packed gym at Boone High School in Orlando, Florida. However, his commitment happened as a standalone event in July. \nAnd really, that's the crux of the issue. There's no longer a big, recruiting extravaganza on the college football calendar. It's only one of many battles. As soon as high school recruits sign in December, it's on to bowl games and the transfer window. Then it's staff turnover and getting the new roster on campus. Before long, the focus shifts to the next recruiting class. At some point, the actual 2026 team comes into focus. It's a never-ending treadmill for programs. During the heyday of National Signing Day, entire school districts would pause for athletes to have their moment. Athletes from football to basketball to track and field would gather in gymnasiums, surrounded by community and media for a day of pageantry and celebration. \nBy the time February arrives, the blue-chip football players are gone. They're already in the machine. \n            ",

For the second time in NFL history, the big game will feature the New England Patriots facing the Seattle Seahawks. The Patriots punched their ticket to Super Bowl LX with a 10-7 win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship. The two teams combined for the second-lowest point total in AFC title game history (Dolphins 14-0 over Jets in 1982).The Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl for an NFL-record 12th time, and to get there, Drake Maye did something that Tom Brady never did: He won a playoff game in Denver. Brady went 0-3 in his career in the Mile High city with two of those losses coming in an AFC title game. On Seattle's end, the Seahawks earned their way to the Super Bowl by beating the Rams in a 31-27 thriller. Sam Darnold threw for 332 yards and three touchdowns in the win. The Seahawks are now headed to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in franchise history and the first time since the 2014 season when they faced the Patriots. \n        \n            \n                Madden NFL 26 Super Bowl 2026 simulation: Seahawks and Patriots are in for another instant classic\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn that game, Russell Wilson was famously picked off by Malcolm Butler at the 1-yard line with under 30 seconds left to play in a game that the Patriots ended up winning 28-24. Super Bowl LX will feature the AFC's highest-scoring offense going up against a Seahawks defense that gave up the fewest points in the NFL this year. Not only that, but the matchup on the other side of the ball should also be solid with the NFL's third-highest scoring offense in Seattle going up against a Patriots defense that surrendered the fourth-fewest points in the league this year. A great AFC offense vs. a great NFC defense? A great AFC defense vs. a great NFC offense? We could be in for another classic, just like the two teams gave us in Super Bowl XLIX. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8Patriots vs. Seahawks -- Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25AFC Championship\n(2) Patriots 10-7 over (1) Broncos. This was a dominant performance by a New England defense that has now played three straight dominant games in the playoffs. The Broncos scored on their second possession of the game, but after that, the Patriots' defense shut Denver down. The biggest play of the game came in the second quarter when the Patriots forced a Jarrett Stidham fumble that New England recovered at Denver's 12-yard line. Drake Maye scored on a 6-yard run just two plays later to provide the Patriots' only touchdown of the game. Maye didn't put up huge numbers, but he came up big with his legs: Not only did he score, but he also iced the win with a 7-yard run on third-and-5 with under two minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. NFC Championship(1) Seahawks 31-27 over (5) Rams. With a trip to the Super Bowl on the line Sam Darnold came up big for the Seahawks. Darnold threw for a season-high 346 yards along with three touchdowns to propel Seattle to the win. Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who has been Darnold's favorite weapon all season, had another huge game. JSN caught 10 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks defense struggled some against Matthew Stafford, but the unit also came up with a huge stop on a fourth-down play from Seattle's 6-yard line in the fourth quarter that essentially sealed the win. Divisional Round resultsSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) Steelers\nTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

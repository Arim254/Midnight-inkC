Pereira, the UFC light heavyweight champion, believes he broke his foot during Saturday's fight. Meanwhile, reports claim Ankalaev fought with a broken rib.</p><p>Pereira is shockingly compromised despite how quickly he decimated Ankalaev at UFC 320. After <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-live-updates-results-fight-card-magomed-ankalaev-alex-pereira-2/live/\" target=\"_blank\">knocking out Ankalaev</a> in 80 seconds, \"Poatan\" limped out of the Octagon with what he believes is a broken foot.</p><p>\"It's my foot,\" Pereira, wearing a boot, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hESHFh7dxPo\" target=\"_blank\">told reporters</a>, via a Portuguese interpreter, at the UFC 320 post-fight press conference. \"I'm pretty sure it's broken. The inside calf kicks were working. I threw a few of those, and then he  switched stances, and I think I was in the wrong range. And I threw  another kick to his lead leg, and it landed on the tip of my foot.

But he's a grown man, he makes his own decisions, and he  lives by his actions.\" </p><p>On Monday, reports emerged that Ankalaev fought Pereira with a broken rib. Léo Guimaraes, whose Twitter bio describes him as a combat sports journalist, <a href=\"https://x.com/leoguimaraesmma/status/1975315482342531302\" target=\"_blank\">posted a video</a> of Ankalaev undergoing rib treatment approximately 20 days before the fight.

A fully healthy Pereira looked as dominant and dangerous as ever in overwhelming Ankalaev with pressure and the threat of his one-punch knockout power en route to an 80-second TKO win. </p><p>While the victory was redemptive to Pereira's standing as, quite possibly, the biggest star in all of UFC, it seemed to do even more in regards to his critical ranking among the pound-for-pound best following what now appears to be a hiccup against Ankaalev in their first meeting when Pereira was reportedly battling a broken hand and a case of norovirus. </p><p>Gone was the worldwide travel and life as an ambassador between fights as Pereira chose to hunker down at his Connecticut gym alongside mentor (and former UFC champion) Glover Teixeira. The renewed focus was visible from the opening bell as Pereira raced across the cages to pressure Ankalaev and force him into a defensive posture. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-results-takeaways-alex-pereira-merab-dvalishvili-continue-to-build-historically-strong-resumes/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>UFC 320 results, takeaways: Alex Pereira, Merab Dvalishvili continue to build historically strong resumes</p>\n                <p>\n                    Brian Campbell                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"UFC 320 results, takeaways: Alex Pereira, Merab Dvalishvili continue to build historically strong resumes\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/05/41c278cc-dbba-4cb3-a8f5-5fcc1c16db54/thumbnail/270x152/b4326a5e479c231984a3f2eeac3f86e1/alex-pereira-arms-320.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>All it eventually took was a single mistake from Ankalaev and the opening was filled by a rocket right cross to drop him before Pereira caused a halt to the bout with elbows and hammer strikes from top position on the ground. </p><p>Through less than four years as a UFC fighter, Pereira has accomplished more as a two-division champion than most Hall of Famers do over an entire career. \"Poatan\" has a 10-2 record in the UFC with seven wins against current or former champions and eight title bout appearances in just 12 fights overall. He also holds the distinction of having defeated every fighter he has faced inside the Octagon.</p><p>Even though he's approaching 40 following a lengthy kickboxing career which saw him win titles in two divisions with GLORY and get inducted into its Hall of Fame, Pereira's age might not be an immediate factor toward his continued pursuit of greatness now that he is openly pushing for a move up to heavyweight. </p>\n<p>Pereira, who will need some time to rest following <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-alex-pereira-says-he-probably-broke-his-foot-magomed-ankalaev-reportedly-fought-with-broken-rib/\" target=\"_blank\">what appeared to be a broken foot</a></span> suffered against Ankalaev in their rematch, has said he covets a super fight against Jon Jones next June at <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/president-donald-trump-confirms-ufc-white-house-date-dana-white-denies-conor-mcgregor-is-booked/\" target=\"_blank\">the UFC event planned for the White House</a></span> in Washington, D.C. The even bigger move available to him, however, could be a shot at the winner of the October heavyweight title bout between Tom Aspinall and Cyril Gane that would give Pereira the first shot at becoming a three-division UFC champion. </p><p>No matter what happens, Pereira's ability to hide his projected weaknesses on the ground has been a huge part of his history making success. And should he find similar results in a third weight class, there's a legitimate opportunity for \"Poatan\" to one day exit the sport as the greatest and most accomplished fighter in history. </p><p>Savor Pereira's all-time greatness while you still can. He is a truly unique fighter and pay-per-view superstar. </p>\n<h2><strong>Men's pound-for-pound rankings</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Ilia Topuria -- Lightweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 18-0 | Previous ranking: No. 1</em></strong></p><p>Topuria took a massive step forward in becoming the new face of the promotion by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-317-results-highlights-ilia-topuria-knocks-out-charles-oliveira-to-claim-second-ufc-title-at-lightweight/live/\">knocking out Charles Oliveira at UFC 317</a> in June to capture the vacant lightweight title. The first unbeaten, two-division champion in UFC history just might have the most technical and explosive boxing skills the Octagon has ever seen. Topuria appears on his way toward becoming the biggest MMA star since Conor McGregor and could be in line to face Justin Gaethje in early 2026. </p><h3><strong>2. Merab Dvalishvili -- Bantamweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 21-4 | Previous ranking: No. 3</em></strong></p><p>It's scary to think about but, at age 34, \"The Machine\" only continues to get better as his 135-pound title reign continues. Five months after he outpointed unbeaten Umar Nurmagomedov despite an injured back, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-316-results-highlights-merab-dvalishvili-rips-through-sean-omalley-in-rematch-to-retain-title/live/\">Dvalishvili submitted former champion Sean O'Malley</a> in their June rematch at UFC 316. A third title defense of 2025 came in October when he outpointed Cory Sandhagen. Dvalishvili's cardio might be unlike anyone else in UFC history.</p><h3><strong>3. Islam Makhachev -- Welterweight</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 27-1 | Previous ranking: No. 2</em></strong></p><p>Makhachev chose to vacate his 155-pound title despite the presence of former featherweight king Ilia Topuria moving up to his division. At 33, Makhachev is looking to add to his increasingly legendary résumé by competing for a title in a second weight class. He will challenge new welterweight champion Jack Della Maddalena this fall with a shot at equaling Anderson Silva's UFC record of 16 consecutive wins at November's UFC 322 card  in New York.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Alex Pereira -- Light heavyweight</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 12-3 | Previous ranking: No. 8</em></strong></p><p>Talk about a comeback victory. The 37-year-old Brazilian slugger had looked sluggish in a decision loss against the technical Magomed Ankalaev in March. Vowing to return at full health after competing at just 40% of himself, Pereira wasted no time in finishing Ankalaev in their October rematch at UFC 320 to regain the title and call for a much-anticipated move up to heavyweight and a third title in as many divisions.</p><h3><strong>5. Khamzat Chimaev -- Middleweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 15-0 | Previous ranking: No. 4</em></strong></p><p>Despite years of inactivity due to injury, illness and bad luck, Chimaev proved at UFC 319 in August just how dangerous he truly is when fully healthy. He also shut up any critics wondering if he possessed five-round cardio by utterly dominating Dricus du Plessis on the ground in a shutout decision. While many fans referred to the gameplan that Chimaev executed against DDP as boring, the performance sent a stern message to the rest of the pack at 185 pounds that Chimaev is ready to begin a new era.</p><h3><strong>6. Alexandre Pantoja -- Flyweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 31-5 | Previous ranking: No. 5</em></strong></p><p>Aging like a fine wine, the 35-year-old native of Brazil recorded his fourth title defense with a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-317-results-highlights-alexandre-pantoja-submits-kai-kara-france-with-ease-to-retain-flyweight-title/\">submission of Kai Kara-France</a> at UFC 317 in June. The victory moved Pantoja into first place for most victories, finishes and submissions in flyweight history. A showdown against red-hot contender Joshua Van is next as Pantoja continues to add on to his legacy during this late career renaissance.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. Alexander Volkanovski -- Featherweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 27-4 | Previous ranking: No. 6</em></strong></p><p>A 14-month layoff did the 36-year-old Volkanovski good as he rebounded from a pair of knockout losses to the two best fighters in the world by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-314-results-highlights-alexander-volkanovski-recaptures-featherweight-title-with-win-over-diego-lopes/live/\">brilliantly outpointing Diego Lopes</a> to capture the vacant 145-pound title at UFC 314 in April. Now a two-time champion, Volkanovski proved, even this late in his career, that skills, IQ and timing can still defeat youth and power. A title defense against unbeaten Lerone Murphy appears to be next in December.</p><h3><strong>8. Jack Della Maddalena -- Welterweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 24-4, 1 NC | Previous ranking: No. 9</em></strong></p><p>Despite a 14-month layoff and close victories in his previous three fights, the Australian slugger became the class of the 170-pound division with his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-315-results-highlights-jack-della-maddalena-upsets-belal-muhammad-to-earn-welterweight-title/live/\">hard-fought decision win over Belal Muhammad</a> at UFC 315 in May. Della Maddalena showed elite boxing and footwork yet it was his takedown defense which played the biggest role in JDM conquering such a deep division. His first title defense comes against Makhachev in November at UFC 322. </p><h3><strong>9. Dricus du Plessis -- Middleweight</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 22-3 | Previous ranking: No. 10</em></strong></p><p>As impressive as du Plessis' first nine trips to the Octagon truly were, he proved quickly out of answers in yielding his middleweight title to unbeaten Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 319 in August. DDP simply had nothing for Chimaev on the ground and looked like a novice despite showing toughness and a willingness to keep fighting. A late rally in the closing seconds, aided by two referee standups, wasn't enough to save face in a one-sided dismantling.</p>\n<h3><strong>10. Tom Aspinall – Heavyweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 15-3 | Previous ranking: NR</em></strong></p><p>The 32-year-old British slugger with some of the fastest hands the division has seen finally earned undisputed champion status when Jon Jones vacated his title and briefly retired earlier this year. Aspinall who previously defended his interim title last summer, returns in October to defend the belt against Cyril Gane at UFC 321. The stalling and injury breaks from Jones did nothing but stall Aspinall's career. It's time for him to make up for lost time.</p><p><strong><em>Dropped out:</em></strong><em> Magomed Ankalaev</em></p><p><strong><em>Just missed:</em></strong><em> Ankalaev, Umar Nurmagomedov, Shavkat Rakhkmonov, Lerone Murphy, Reinier de Ridder</em></p><h2><strong>Women's pound-for-pound rankings</strong></h2><h3><strong>1. Valentina Shevchenko -- Flyweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 24-4-1 | Previous ranking: No. 1</em></strong></p><p>The future Hall of Famer only continued to cement her legacy even further at UFC 315 in May when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-315-results-highlights-valentina-shevchenko-edges-past-manon-fiorot-to-retain-flyweight-title/\">she outpointed the red-hot Manon Fiorot</a> over five rounds. The 37-year-old Shevchenko, who improved her UFC record for title wins by a female with 10, also achieved her eighth title defense by making the championship adjustments when it mattered most. A superfight against strawweight queen Zhang Weili is on tap for UFC 322 in New York</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Zhang Weili -- Strawweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 25-3 | Previous ranking: No. 2</em></strong></p><p>Zhang improved to 10-0 in the UFC against everyone not named Rose Namajunas when she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-312-results-highlights-champion-zhang-weili-dominates-tatiana-suarez-as-underdog-to-retain-title/\">dominated unbeaten Tatiana Suarez</a> over five rounds at UFC 312 in February. At 35, Zhang only continues to round out her game and plans to attempt to prove so by moving up to 125 pounds in hopes of becoming a two-division champion. Zhang will challenge Valentina Shevchenko for the flyweight title at UFC 322 in November.</p><h3><strong>3. Kayla Harrison -- Bantamweight champion</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 19-1 | Previous ranking: No. 3</em></strong></p><p>Despite enduring an insane cut to make championship weight of 135 pounds, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-316-results-highlights-kayla-harrison-wins-ufc-title-faces-off-with-amanda-nunes-after-beating-pena/\">Harrison dominated two-time champion Juianna Pena</a> at UFC 316 in June to capture the women's bantamweight title. A showdown against former champion (and former teammate) Amanda Nunes appears to be next as MMA's female G.O.A.T. returns to the sport at age 37. Either way, Harrison's inspirational story of persevering provided a true feel-good moment.</p><h3><strong>4. Manon Fiorot -- Flyweight</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 12-2 | Previous ranking: No. 4</em></strong></p><p>The 35-year-old native of France snapped an impressive 7-0 start to her UFC career by coming up just short in a close decision loss to champion Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 315 in June. Fiorot, who rebounded from a disastrous first round in which her nose was battered to rely on her size and clinch work against Shevchenko in a close chess match, will look to bounce back in October when she takes on a streaking Jasmine Jasudavicius in Vancouver.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Natalia Silva -- Flyweight</strong></h3><p><strong><em>Record: 19-5-1 | Previous ranking: No. 5</em></strong></p><p>Unbeaten in seven trips to the Octagon, Silva earned a decision in May at UFC 315 against former champion Alexa Grasso to put the 28-year-old native of Brazil in position for a possible title shot. The dynamic striker has won 13 fights in a row overall since a 2017 loss on the regional scene to Marina Rodriguez and remains a difficult test for any flyweight given her speed, feints and accurate strikes. </p><p><strong><em>Dropped out</em></strong><em>: None</em></p><p><strong><em>Just missed</em></strong><em>: Virna Jandiroba, Erin Blanchfield, Julianna Pena, Alexa Grasso, Tatiana Suarez</em></p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Identifying potential fantasy basketball busts is crucial for draft success in 2025-26. While these players carry name recognition and proven track records, several red flags suggest they'll underperform their current CBS average draft position (ADP). From <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2938032/trae-youngs/fantasy/\">Trae Young's</a> declining efficiency to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3178194/scottie-barnes/fantasy/\">Scottie Barnes</a> facing reduced usage, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2938080/anfernee-simons/fantasy/\">Anfernee Simons</a> adjusting to Boston, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1647481/nikola-vucevics/fantasy/\">Nikola Vucevic's</a> age-related regression, these first-through-fourth-round picks present significant risk. Smart fantasy managers know avoiding busts is as important as landing sleepers. This guide breaks down why these players may disappoint and where to actually draft them for value.</p><h2>Trae Young - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/ATL/atlanta-hawks/\">Atlanta Hawks</a></h2><p>Young has gone as high as fifth and as low as 17th in some drafts, though the consensus is that he's a first-round talent across all formats. It's hard to see the star floor general as anything other than that after a 2024-25 season in which he led the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> in assists with a career-high 11.6 dimes per contest. Young has averaged a double-double in each of the previous three campaigns, but there are causes for concern. </p><p>For one, his scoring numbers have regressed in each of the last two years, and his 41.1 percent from the floor in 2025-26 was his lowest since his rookie year in 2018-19. He's also made under 35 percent of his threes in two of his last three seasons, so his loaded stat lines are based on volume and not efficiency. Given that the Hawks upgraded their roster in 2025-26, mainly via the addition of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2108420/kristaps-porzingis/fantasy/\">Kristaps Porzingis</a> and the return to full fitness of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3178366/jalen-johnson/fantasy/\">Jalen Johnson</a>, it wouldn't be crazy to see Young trending in the wrong direction from a statistical perspective. </p><p>His role as the Hawks' primary playmaker is not at risk, but with his usage rate likely to decrease in 2025-26, he might perform closer to second-round value rather than a first-round option.</p>\n<h2>Scottie Barnes - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/TOR/toronto-raptors/\">Toronto Raptors</a></h2><p>There are mixed reviews on what Barnes can bring to the table in fantasy. There are no doubts regarding his talent, but it's uncertain if he'll be able to repeat the numbers he delivered in 2024-25, when he averaged 19.3 points, 7.7 rebounds, 5.8 assists and a combined 2.4 steals-plus-blocks per game in 65 regular-season contests. The first issue that comes to mind is the durability, as Barnes has played more than 75 regular-season games just once in his four-year career in the Association. </p><p>A bigger problem than the durability is the fact that Barnes isn't expected to have the same usage rate he had in the 2024-25 campaign. The return of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2202503/brandon-ingram/fantasy/\">Brandon Ingram</a>, who's expected to be healthy for Opening Night, and the presence of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041122/rj-barrett/fantasy/\">RJ Barrett</a> will reduce Barnes' time with the ball. Considering he'll have to share touches on offense with Ingram as well, it wouldn't be surprising if Barnes experiences a scoring regression. If that happens, he'd fit better as a third-round talent instead of a player to take in the second round.</p><h2>Anfernee Simons - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/BOS/boston-celtics/\">Boston Celtics</a></h2><p>Simons has one of the biggest splits in terms of potential selection in standard 12-team leagues, as he's gone as high as 20th and as low as 49th in some formats. The uncertainty surrounding his role is clear, as Simons was traded from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/POR/portland-trail-blazers/\">Trail Blazers</a> to the Celtics in the offseason. Boston isn't expected to contend in 2025-26 after shredding salary and being without <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268018/jayson-tatum/fantasy/\">Jayson Tatum</a> (Achilles), but Simons still profiles to be a starter in the backcourt alongside <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2844730/derrick-white/fantasy/\">Derrick White</a>.</p>\n<p>Simons is a dynamic guard who can be a deadly scorer when he's at the top of his game, but inconsistency is an issue for him. He averaged 21.0 points, 4.4 assists, 2.7 rebounds and 3.2 three-pointers in 33.6 minutes per game across 19 outings since the All-Star break in 2024-25, but his overall numbers saw him fail to hit the 20-ppg mark for the first time after doing so in the previous two campaigns. If he's unable to get the same touches he had in Portland, which is likely considering he'll share the court and the offensive workload with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2202365/jaylen-brown/fantasy/\">Jaylen Brown</a> and Derrick White, Simons should be a fourth-round talent. Drafting him any higher would be reaching for what he did in previous years, and not for his 2025-26 upside.</p><h2>Nikola Vucevic - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/CHI/chicago-bulls/\">Chicago Bulls</a></h2><p>During his prime years, Vucevic was one of the best offensive big men in the Eastern Conference. Even though he remains a player worth rostering in all formats as the Bulls' starting center, it's no secret that he's trending in the wrong direction in recent years. Father Time remains undefeated, and Vucevic is clearly past his prime. A reduction in his numbers is expected to occur, especially since the Bulls are transitioning to a younger team, and the Montenegrin big man no longer aligns with the organization's timeline.</p><p>Even though Vucevic averaged 18.5 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in 2024-25, his best scoring output since the 2020-21 campaign, the Bulls are expected to hand <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29275373/matas-buzelis/fantasy/\">Matas Buzelis</a> a bigger role in 2025-26. That, along with the presence of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3041443/coby-white/fantasy/\">Coby White</a> and the return of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26646085/josh-giddey/fantasy/\">Josh Giddey</a>, means Vucevic could be in line for a secondary role on offense for Chicago. If that happens during the entire campaign, it's hard to see Vucevic posting value as a top-50 player. He's routinely been selected as a fourth-round talent, but he might be a better option as a fifth-round or even sixth-round alternative.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Cleveland Browns</a> quarterback room has dominated headlines throughout 2025. Going back to the spring, the franchise double-dipped at the position in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL Draft</a> with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121534/dillon-gabriel/\">Dillon Gabriel</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26710004/shedeur-sanders/\">Shedeur Sanders</a>. They were then part of a four-player quarterback battle this summer that also included <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1250697/joe-flacco/\">Joe Flacco</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804969/kenny-pickett/\">Kenny Pickett</a>. Both of those veterans have since been traded, and the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/browns-trade-joe-flacco-to-bengals-cincinnati-acquires-veteran-qb-from-division-rival-in-late-round-pick-swap/\" target=\"_blank\">Flacco deal to Cincinnati</a></span> that went down on Tuesday comes just a week after he was benched in place of Gabriel. It's enough to give any Browns fan whiplash when trying to keep up with the position group. </p><p>And then there's the \"other\" Browns quarterback: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2133482/deshaun-watson/\">Deshaun Watson</a>. Remember him? </p><p>He was supposed to be the franchise's savior, but his off-the-field issues, coupled with poor play when he was on the field (9-10 as Cleveland's starter), have made his acquisition arguably the worst trade in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history. That's particularly true given his unprecedented $230 million fully guaranteed extension that was agreed to following the trade to the Browns. </p><p>He's still with the team, albeit on the physically unable to perform list as he continues to recover from an Achilles injury. Watson initially suffered the injury during Cleveland's Week 7 matchup against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a> last season. Then, underwent surgery in January of this year after he re-ruptured his right Achilles. </p><p>Given the volatility that the Browns quarterback room is currently experiencing, it's fair to ask if Watson could be the latest quarterback to enter the conversation if he's closer to returning to form. </p>\n<h2>How is Deshaun Watson's recovery going? </h2><p>Again, Watson is looking to get back onto the field after multiple ruptures to his Achilles, with the most recent coming this offseason, so he has an uphill battle to climb on the rehab front. Watson has continued to chronicle his recovery on social media, and multiple video clips do show the veteran quarterback sprinting, dropping back, and throwing passes. </p><p>These clips below were from August. </p>\n<h2>Will Deshaun Watson play in 2025?</h2><p>In the lead-up to Dillon Gabriel's first NFL start on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/examining-browns-qb-room-dillon-gabriel-joe-flacco-shedeur-sanders\" target=\"_blank\">NFL Media</a> reported that Watson, who has his entire 2026 salary already guaranteed, would be part of the Browns' evaluation of the quarterback position and future planning around it, if he ends up on the field at some point this season. However, the report also notes that Watson playing in 2025 is considered unlikely. <a href=\"https://x.com/ScottPetrak/status/1975264512812196070\" target=\"_blank\">The Chronicle-Telegram's Scott Petrak</a> also noted on Monday that Cleveland would not be opening up Watson's practice window this week, leading up to the team's Week 6 matchup vs. Pittsburgh. </p>\n<p>Even if Watson is activated off of PUP and begins practicing with the Browns at some point this season, it's no guarantee that they'd slot him in as a starter in 2025. As the team figures out what they have, Sanders may warrant a look over Watson if Gabriel fades as Cleveland would likely want to get a firm look at their other first-year signal-caller over a known commodity in Watson. </p>\n            </div>",

Finalizing the modification <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ncaa-approves-change-to-new-single-transfer-portal-window-how-will-it-work-in-college-football/\">brought forth last month</a> by the FBS Oversight Committee, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> transfer portal will have just one window to enter the portal moving forward rather than one in the winter and another in the spring. </p><p>That window in 2026 will run for two weeks from Jan. 2-16. Because the 12-team College Football Playoff schedule extends deep into January, players participating in a postseason game on or after Jan. 12 will have an opportunity to start the transfer process during a five-day period that begins the day after their final postseason game. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/NCAA_PR/status/1975677627517300955\">The second alteration</a> pertains to the transfer exceptions granted to players after coaching changes. The exception currently allows players to enter the transfer portal during a 30-day window that opens the day after their coach leaves or is fired. The committee approved a new format, however, that is shortened to 15 days and begins five days after a new coach is hired or announced, seemingly in an effort to crack down on midseason portal activity.</p><p>Both of these changes are expected to be finalized after the committee concludes its meeting on Wednesday.</p><p>Players whose coaches have already departed this season are grandfathered in and may still enter the transfer portal within the existing 30-day window. That includes players at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VATECH/virginia-tech-hokies/\">Virginia Tech</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLAST/oklahoma-state-cowboys/\">Oklahoma State</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a>, which all fired their coaches within the last month.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ncaa-approves-change-to-new-single-transfer-portal-window-how-will-it-work-in-college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NCAA approves change to new single transfer portal window: How will it work in college football?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Will Backus                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NCAA approves change to new single transfer portal window: How will it work in college football?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/29/2d721a1c-c373-4f7e-ab39-77ed286cfb33/thumbnail/270x152/895553f47cc9ba6b788e9e2c52b9221f/adobe-express-file-11.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>What could these changes mean for college football?</h2><p>The adjustment to the rules involving programs with coaching changes could result in fewer players leaving their teams after changes in leadership. It has not been uncommon in seasons past to see a mass exodus in the wake of coach firings or retirements. But with players required to stay put until after a replacement is selected, some could elect to play for the new coach instead of seeking a new school altogether.</p><p>The 15-day January window is open to all players and is longer than the initial Jan. 2-11 window the FBS Oversight Committee initially proposed. Transfers must enter their name into the portal during the window but are not required to enroll at a new school before the Jan. 16 entry deadline. This is a replacement for the previous December window and marks the end of the spring window, which drew heavy scrutiny from coaches due to its timing at the conclusion of most teams' spring camps. More than 1,000 FBS players used the post-spring portal window this year, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer.</p><p>Some coaches, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ohio-states-ryan-day-speaks-out-against-proposed-single-transfer-portal-window-it-doesnt-make-any-sense/\">including Ohio State's Ryan Day</a>, spoke out against the idea of a single window in January because of its concurrent timing with the College Football Playoff. The NCAA will attempt to offset the negative impacts on playoff teams by allowing players to initiate the transfer process during a five-day period that begins the day after their teams' final postseason game.</p>\n<p>For example, if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> reaches the national championship game for the second straight year, the Buckeyes will play for the title on Jan. 19. Players may enter the transfer portal from Jan. 20-24 even though the winter window will have already expired.</p>\n            </div>",

That's two fifth-round picks for two quarterbacks, giving the Browns 10 picks in 2026 -- including the 2026 first-round pick from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/JAC/jacksonville-jaguars/\">Jaguars</a>. </p><p>The Browns are stacking picks and moving on from a veteran quarterback who won't be part of their rebuild. They'll get to see what they have in Gabriel for the remainder of 2025, and possibly Sanders. This is the right move going forward for Cleveland, which is in the process of a rebuild. </p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/three-reasons-why-joe-flacco-trade-actually-makes-sense-for-bengals/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Three reasons why the Joe Flacco trade actually makes sense for the Bengals</p>\n                <p>\n                    John Breech                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Three reasons why the Joe Flacco trade actually makes sense for the Bengals\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/36bd349c-e362-457f-b22c-e1eafd48a117/thumbnail/270x152/052eca50c804d2f052214c434ca1a9a0/flacco.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>Bengals: B-</h2><p>How much did the Bengals really have to give up for Flacco here? Was the price of a 40-year-old quarterback that high? Or does it signify how desperate the Bengals are to have a quarterback who isn't Browning?</p><p>The Bengals pretty much traded the same price to acquire Flacco as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LV/las-vegas-raiders/\">Raiders</a> did for Pickett. They are looking to get better quarterback play than what they have received from Browning in his three starts. Browning has been abysmal, completing 64.1% of his passes with four touchdowns to five interceptions and a 70.7 passer rating. He's ranked 37th out of 38 quarterbacks in passer rating (only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> is lower) and 32nd out of 37 quarterbacks in yards per attempt (5.6). </p><p>Flacco wasn't better in those three weeks (and he was benched prior to Week 5). He completed 52.9% of his passes with zero touchdowns and three interceptions (47.7 rating). Perhaps the Bengals feel Flacco would be better off slinging the ball down the field to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/\">Tee Higgins</a>, which better suits his style of play.</p>\n<p>The raw numbers don't back up the deal, but the offensive skill-position players better suit Flacco's game. This may not matter with the Bengals offensive line anyway, but Cincinnati is taking a chance here. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>NEW YORK</span> -- The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">New York Yankees</a> have had a lot of problems with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TOR/toronto-blue-jays/\">Toronto Blue Jays</a> in the ALDS, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> is not one of them. Tuesday night in Game 3, New York's captain launched a game-tying three-run home run off the left field foul pole to complete his team's comeback from an early 6-1 deficit. The Yankees have avoided elimination for at least one more night and forced Game 4 on Wednesday (<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/gametracker/live/MLB_20251007_TOR@NYY/\" target=\"_blank\">NYY 9, TOR 6</a>). </p><p>\"I felt like I made good contact and I thought we had a chance,\" Judge said after the game about the ball staying fair. \"You  just never know with the wind, if it's going to push it foul, keep  curving or not.  But I guess a couple ghosts out there helped kind of  keep that fair.\"</p><p>The home run was Judge's first of the 2025 postseason and also his sixth career homer with his team facing elimination, tying Hall of Famer David Ortiz for the most in MLB history. The Yankees are 4-2 in elimination games when Judge goes deep.</p><p>That is a special home run hit by a special player. According to Statcast, it is the fastest pitch Judge has ever hit for a homer (99.7 mph) and also the farthest inside pitch Judge has ever hit for a homer (1.2 feet). It is the fastest inside pitch any player has hit out of the park since pitch-tracker launched in 2008. It takes a 1 of 1 player to do that. </p>\n<p>\"You're just in the moment.  Just trust your eyes,  trust your swing.\" Judge said when asked how he got to that pitch. \"I feel like I can get to every pitch in the zone. I think the biggest thing is just being ready on time.  I think  it's all timing.  That's what a lot of hitting comes down to.\"</p><p>Blue Jays manager John Schneider put it more succinctly: \"That was a ridiculous swing.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/why-blue-jays-john-schneider-isnt-sweating-that-game-changing-aaron-judge-home-run-give-him-credit-man/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Why Blue Jays' John Schneider isn't sweating that game-changing Aaron Judge home run: 'Give him credit, man'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Snyder                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Why Blue Jays' John Schneider isn't sweating that game-changing Aaron Judge home run: 'Give him credit, man'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/83c2732f-07cf-4648-a775-c4729683c063/thumbnail/270x152/3f5c2dbd6bc9aefcc9e31a25a2127d76/judge-getty-3.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Judge has been criticized, not unfairly, for a lack of postseason impact throughout his career. He entered 2025 as a .199/.313/.435 hitter in 57 career postseason games, numbers far below his immense regular-season production. Even this postseason, Judge was 8 for 18 (.444) going into Game 3, but with seven singles and not much game-changing impact. </p>\n<p>Now, Judge is shedding the postseason monkey that has been on his back the last nine years. He went 3 for 4 with an RBI double to get the Yankees to within 6-2, and then the three-run homer to tie Game 3. The big night improved him to .500/.577/.727 through New York's six games this postseason. Judge has reached base 15 times and made only 11 outs. </p><p>The Blue Jays were spooked enough to intentionally walk Judge with one out and the bases empty in the sixth inning Tuesday, which led to an insurance run. And on top of the offense, Judge made a diving catch to take at least a single away from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2504134/anthony-santander/\">Anthony Santander</a>, if not keep a run off the board. It's not often one player can take over a game in this sport, but Judge did in Game 3. </p><p>\"The diving catch was great. A perfect jump on it,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. \"Right when we got  back in, now here they go, it looks like they're going to lead off with  base runners, and he shut it down right away.\"</p>\n<p>The five-run comeback is tied for the second largest in Yankees postseason history behind a six-run comeback in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATL/atlanta-braves/\">Atlanta Braves</a>. It is also the third-largest comeback in an elimination game in baseball history. The Yankees still have never been swept in the ALDS. They are 4-0 all-time in Game 3 when down 2-0 in the series. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm-jr/\">Jazz Chisholm Jr.</a> hit his first home run of the playoffs to give the Yankees a lead they would never surrender in the fifth inning, and five relievers kept Toronto off the scoreboard for the final 6 ⅔ innings. That includes <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2066820/devin-williams/\">Devin Williams</a>' first four-out appearance since May 2023. The Yankees got contributions up and down the lineup and from almost everyone in the bullpen. </p><p>Judge was the star of Game 3 though and the Yankees needed him to be. There was no chance -- zero -- the Yankees would be able to force Game 4 without Judge making a difference in Game 3. He needed to put his team on his back, which he does for long stretches of time every season. Now Judge has done it in October, and the Yankees live to play another day. </p>\n<p>\"Just trying to just do my job, what I've been trying to do all year,\" Judge said. \"Not trying to do too much.  Guy's on base, drive him in.  If no one's on  base, try to get a rally going.  That's all you can do, especially in  front of our fans.\"</p>\n            </div>",

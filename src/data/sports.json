    "body": "\nThe Week 15 NFL DFS contests begin with a 'Thursday Night Football' matchup between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons at 8:15 p.m. ET. Bijan Robinson, Bucky Irving and Emeka Egbuka all found the end zone when these teams met earlier this year, as they'll be amongst the most sought after NFL DFS picks. However, they could also set back your TNF DFS salary cap quite a bit, so you'll have to complement them with low-cost alternatives.  Both squads utilize multiple running backs, so Tyler Allgeier, Rachaad White and Sean Tucker deserve consideration for your NFL DFS strategy. Rostering low-risk, high-reward players is what everyone playing daily Fantasy football manager seeks, but knowing which of these options to insert into NFL DFS lineups is always the challenge. One of those could be the returning Mike Evans, who is active for Tampa. Before making any Buccaneers vs. Falcons NFL DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to 'Thursday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Falcons vs. BuccaneersOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football' is Falcons running back Bijan Robinson. The Pro Bowler is as consistent a Fantasy player as any running back, as he has at least 88 scrimmage yards in all but one game. That includes 124 total yards versus Tampa in Week 1, as he has back-to-back outings versus the Bucs with 100-plus yards and a touchdown. Robinson ranks second amongst all running backs in 2025 in receiving yards, which should certainly come in handy on Thursday. That's because the Buccaneers have allowed the most receiving yards to opposing running backs. In Week 14, Tampa allowed sixth-round rookie RB Devin Neal of New Orleans to have 84 total yards and a score, which could be Robinson's Fantasy floor for TNF. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Bijan Robinson to go Over 76.5 rushing yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his 'Thursday Night Football' NFL DFS strategy around Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield, who has diced up Atlanta's defense recently. Mayfield has three passing touchdowns in each of his last three starts versus the Falcons while also averaging 27 rushing yards over this stretch. The Falcons defense also allowed three passing touchdowns last week and has given up an average of 278 passing yards over the last four games, despite facing the likes of Tyler Shough, Tyrod Taylor and Bryce Young. The Falcons defense, however, has kept its last four opponents to an average of under 100 rushing yards, so the Bucs should lean on Mayfield's arm on Thursday. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine. Bet Baker Mayfield to go Over 214.5 passing yards at DraftKings right here:\nHow to set 'Thursday Night Football' NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football', and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

The Bucs have won six of the last 10 meetings against the Falcons, but Tampa Bay is just 1-4 in its past five games overall. Tampa Bay is favored by 4.5 points at home, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has identified Buccaneers (-4.5) as one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook for online sports betting. The model is backing Over 222.5 total points in Rockets vs. Clippers, while one of SportsLine's top experts has a pick from No. 4 Iowa State taking on Iowa in a rivalry college basketball matchup. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Buccaneers are 1-4 over their last five games, however, three of those losses came to teams in the Super Bowl picture, falling to the Rams, Bills and Patriots. Meanwhile, the Falcons (4-9) are 1-7 over their last eight games and are coming off an ugly 37-9 loss to the Seahawks last week. Kirk Cousins is 37 years old as the current Atlanta QB1, and he's clearly not the quarterback he once was. He'll take the field without Drake London (knee) once again. Meanwhile, Baker Mayfield could have reinforcements his way with wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan activated from IR. The model projects Tampa Bay to cover in 51% of simulations. Back Tampa Bay at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Clippers vs. Rockets: Over 222.5 points (-108)Kevin Durant and James Harden, former teammates with two different franchises, go head-to-head on Thursday, with Durant leading the Rockets and Harden spearheading the Clippers. Both teams are having significantly different levels of success this season, but with both teams rested and having not played since Saturday, the model projects these veteran superstars to play significant minutes, which could lead to more scoring for themselves and their teammates. The Rockets are fourth in the league in scoring at 120.9 ppg this season, and the Clippers have allowed at least 107 points in 13 of their last 14 contests. The model projects the Over to hit in 62.9% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Iowa vs. Iowa State: Under 143.5 points (-110)\"It's fair to speculate if the Hawkeyes can really keep pace in \"Hoops Cy-Hawk\" after Iowa lost contact vs. Michigan State last week,\" SportsLine legendary expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The task of slowing ISU's offense (better than 94 ppg and hitting north of 54% from the floor) will likely come down to how well Ben McCollum's offense controls pace and tempo, and preventing the Cyclones from deploying their devastating transition game that helped bury top-ranked Purdue last Saturday. Easier said than done, but even if winning the game might be a real stretch for Iowa, McCollum's team can slow the pace as good as any, and with four starters (including star G Bennett Stirtz) hitting better than 50% from the floor, the Hawkeyes can afford to be patient.\" Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Thursday Night Football, NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

Over the course of the next five weeks, there will be 46 bowl matchups (including all College Football Playoff games) and the college football bowl schedule includes some stylistically intriguing battles. After being snubbed by the College Football Playoff committee, Notre Dame has chosen not to participate in a bowl, but No. 12 BYU, who was also left out, will play No. 22 Georgia Tech in the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Dec. 27. Other matchups that day include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), UConn vs. Army (-5.5) and LSU vs. Houston (-3.5).BYU is a 4.5-point favorite in the latest college football bowl odds, but will they actually show up motivated after it looks like they weren't given serious consideration for the 12-team playoff? Motivation is always a factor during bowl season and it's something that you'll need to consider as you make your college football bowl confidence picks along with opt-outs, transfer portal news, injuries and many more factors. Before entering any college football bowl confidence pools, be sure to see the college football picks from SportsLine's Thomas Casale.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:A frequent guest on national radio and TV shows to discuss college sports, Casale has been sports betting -- and winning -- for more than 30 years.So before filling out your college football pool picks or making any college football bets, you need to see Casale's college football bowl confidence picks.

    "body": "\nAn NFC South matchup kicks off NFL Week 15 as the Atlanta Falcons visit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on 'Thursday Night Football'. Both squads are struggling as Atlanta has lost seven of its last eight, while Tampa has dropped three of four. The Falcons are coming off a 37-9 defeat to Seattle that eliminated Atlanta from postseason contention. The Bucs, meanwhile, were just upset by New Orleans, 24-20, on Sunday. This rivalry is as even as could be as the teams have split their 64 all-time matchups, 32-32. Mike Evans (collarbone) is active for Tampa, while Cade Otton is inactive. Meanwhile, Atlanta's Kyle Pitts (knee) and first-round rookie Jalon Walker (quad) are both active after being limited in practice during the week. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from  Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. The Bucs won their Week 1 meeting, 23-20, on the road. Tampa Bay is a 5.5-point favorite at DraftKings in the latest Falcons vs. Buccaneers odds, while the over/under for total points is 43.5. Tampa is at -275 on the money line (risk $275 to win $100), while Atlanta is at +223 (risk $100 to win $223).

Also, Tampa is just 1-5 ATS at home this season. Atlanta's pass rush has come on strong as of late, averaging 4.5 sacks over the last six games, which is also notable in terms of Atlanta covering as the Bucs are 2-5 ATS when Baker Mayfield is sacked multiple times in a game this season. Speaking of Mayfield, his struggles are a big reason for Tampa's recent woes as he has under 200 yards in four straight games, with more turnovers (five) than passing touchdowns (four) over that stretch. See which team to back at SportsLine, and bet Mayfield to go Under 218.5 passing yards at DraftKings here:\nWhy the Buccaneers can coverTampa's defense can take away what Atlanta does best on offense, and that's running the ball. The Bucs have the No. 8 run defense and have contained Bijan Robinson, as he's averaged just 45.5 rushing yards, at under 4.0 yards per carry, over his last four versus Tampa. There's also the motivation factor in this game, as Tampa is tied with Carolina for the NFC South lead, so it has plenty to play for. Meanwhile, the Falcons were eliminated from any postseason possibility last week, which is, perhaps, a reason why they aren't rushing Drake London (knee) back to the field. His absence makes Atlanta's offense even easier to contain as he had more catches (8) than all other Falcons' wideouts combined (6) in their Week 1 loss to Tampa. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Bucs vs. Falcons  picksHartstein has analyzed Falcons vs. Bucs from every angle and he's leaning Under on the point total. He has also discovered a critical X-factor that has him jumping all over one side of the spread.

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- If you've ever been to an awkward birthday party, then you definitely have a slight idea of how it felt during Joe Burrow's weekly press conference this week. The Bengals franchise quarterback turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was in no mood to celebrate. Some people love when their birthday comes around, but for others, it's just a 24-hour existential crisis where nothing could possibly go right and that seemed to be where Burrow was. Four years ago at this time, Burrow had just turned 25 and he was two months away from playing in the Super Bowl. Since then, not much has gone right. The Bengals did make a return trip to the AFC title game in 2022, but that was followed by a 2023 season where he missed the final seven games of the year due to injury after tearing a ligament in his right wrist. Half of Burrow's career has been spent rehabbing from some sort of injury. There was an ACL tear in 2020 followed by the wrist in 2023 followed by the toe injury this year that knocked him out for nine games. And those are just the major ones, he's also dealt with several other injuries like a calf strain in July of 2023. Burrow may not have been directly complaining about the team with his recent comments, but after sitting in on almost every press conference he's held since July, I can tell you this: He's methodical and he thinks long and hard about everything he says before he puts it out there. With Joe Burrow, there are no accidental messages. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 viewer's guide: Top 10 things to watch, including Super Bowl contenders and Philip Rivers comeback\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlthough he sounded down in the dumps on Wednesday, let's flash back to Sunday real quick. After throwing two back-breaking interceptions in a 39-34 loss to the Bills, no one would have been surprised if he had been upset or had a negative tone, but instead, Burrow almost sounded thankful that he was even able to be on the field for the Bills game. \"I fought my butt off to get back to this spot and to be able to be out there with everybody for our organization and the city, so that's what I'm going to continue to do,\" Burrow said in his postgame interview. \"I take it very seriously. I love what I do and I'm going to continue to do it.\" As he said, he fought to get back on the field for the organization and city. The organization. The city. That's telling. That sounds like a guy who wants to be in Cincinnati. That  And that last sentence from Burrow is the one you should pay attention to: Joe Burrow loves playing football, which is why it's almost impossible to see this ever turning into an Andrew Luck situation. That being said, it's fair to mention Luck's name, because Burrow has now missed 22 games due to injury in his career, which puts him just four behind Luck, who missed 26 total before his abrupt retirement in 2019. \nEven if a retirement is unlikely, the Bengals have already run one former No. 1 overall pick out of town -- Carson Palmer demanded a trade out of Cincinnati back in 2011 because he didn't think he could win a Super Bowl with Mike Brown owning the team -- and although Burrow doesn't seem to be there yet, the Bengals need be paying close attention when he sends out public messages like he did on Wednesday. Let's take a look at a few of Burrow's most notable comments along with the question that he got asked to elicit those comments. \nQ: Does coming back from a serious injury change your competitive fire at all? How does the toe injury maybe change the way you view the game?\nBURROW: \"It certainly doesn't change my desire to win. If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table.\"The comeback from the injury has clearly been weighing on Burrow and whether all the rehab is worth it. \"I think I've been through more than most, and it's certainly not easy on the brain or the body, so I'm just trying to have fun doing it again,\" Burrow said. \nBurrow wasn't supposed to come back until mid-December, but he ended up returning almost a month earlier than expected because he worked his tail off in rehab. However, his efforts have basically now gone to waste after just two games because the Bengals are essentially out of the playoff race following Sunday's loss to the Bills, so it's easy to see why some of the joy might have been sucked out of the game for him this week. Although he's lived in rehab for a good chunk of the past five years, Burrow certainly understands the risks of football as well as anyone. The QB was asked what it's like balancing his well-being versus wanting to come back as quickly as possible and he gave an insightful answer. \"It's something you have to think about,\" Burrow said. \"That's life as a professional athlete. It's no different in basketball, MMA or baseball. It's what we chose. We make a lot of sacrifices and your body is often one of them.\"\nThe most interesting part of Burrow's press conference came when he was asked, point blank, if he had something on his mind because he seemed frustrated. \"There's a lot of things going on right now,\" the QB responded. Are those frustrations football-related or personal? \"All the above.\"That's a wide net to cast: Burrow could be frustrated with himself, with the team, with the organization. with the coaching, with his personal life, with his birthday cake, but the bottom line is that he's frustrated. Burrow is someone who hates losing and you can see it clearly on his face after any loss and if he doesn't think the Bengals are doing enough to fix the team's problems, you could easily see a situation where he starts to think that enough is enough, but let's be clear, he's not going anywhere any time soon. \nOne reason it's hard to see the Burrow situation turning out like the Palmer situation is because the Bengals actually listen to Burrow. Last year, he went on a media tour at the Super Bowl and made it clear that he wanted to see Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Trey Hendrickson all get re-signed. And the Bengals did it. Burrow and Chase are signed through 2029 while Higgins is signed through 2028. The Bengals have a strong offensive nucleous and Burrow isn't going to be ditching that any time soon. So what are some of the other issues? The team has struggled on the offensive line in Burrow's tenure, but it's not for a lack of trying. The Bengals have signed several key free agents (like Orlando Brown and Ted Karras) and they've also used draft capital on the line, including two players who have each started at least 11 games this year (Amarius Mims and Dylan Fairchild). The line has been better, so it seems unlikely that Burrow is frustrated with them. As a matter of fact, he actually complimented the offensive line on Wednesday. Besides talking about Pokemon, the only other comment he seemed enthusiastic about was talking about the offensive line. \nIf the Bengals are going to make any changes this offseason, it's going to have be on the defensive side of the ball. Burrow put up MVP numbers in 2024, but the Bengals didn't make the playoffs because they had a historically bad defense. In 2025, that defense somehow got worse. The unit has definitely improved over the past few weeks and although that sounds like good news, it could also be viewed as a bad thing, because it might convince key decision-makers in the organization that changes don't need to be made. The Bengals have Joe Burrow in his prime and they're about to miss the playoffs for the third straight season. Everyone in the front office needs to ask themselves why that's happening. It's frustrating for fans, it's frustrating for players and it's certainly frustrating for Burrow. It's the kind of frustration that should lead to changes this offseason and Burrow needs to let the team know what kind of changes he wants to see. This organization isn't going to win a Super Bowl anytime soon without Joe Burrow, so keeping him happy should be a top priority.The Bengals have most of the pieces in place to be a Super Bowl contender, they just need to find the missing pieces to the Super Bowl puzzle and then give that puzzle to Burrow for his next birthday. \n            ",

Folliot must also pay a $70,000 fine and return more than $44,000 in corrupt payments. He may not play in, coach in or attend any tennis event authorized by ITIA members or any national association during the ban.An ITIA investigation, which already resulted in discipline for five other players, discovered that Folliot, 26, committed 27 breaches of the Tennis Anti-Corruption Program and was a \"central figure in a network of players operating on behalf of a match-fixing syndicate.\"\nThe time served under the provisional suspension will count toward Folliot's 20-year ban, which will end in May 2044. He will be 44 at the end of the suspension.\nFolliot denied 30 charges stemming from 11 matches between 2022-24, including eight in which he participated. Folliot was charged with contriving the outcome of matches, receiving money to not give best efforts for betting purposes, offering money to other players to fix matches, provision of inside information, conspiracy to corrupt, failure to co-operate with an ITIA investigation and destruction of evidence.Anti-Corruption Hearing Officer Amani Khalifa upheld 27 of the charges in an October hearing and later described Folliot as \"a vector for a wider criminal syndicate, actively recruiting other players and attempting to embed corruption more deeply into the professional tours.\"\nFolliot achieved a career-high world singles ranking of No. 488 in August 2022. He has since fallen to No. 1163 amid a provisional suspension which began in May 2024. Folliot has a 201-156 (.563) singles record for his professional career and is 111-113 (.496) in doubles matches.\n            \n    ",

I dropped it. I did not like losing.\" \nHawke fared infinitely better as an actor. His decorated resume includes a Daytime Emmy Award, as well as nominations for four Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, a British Academy Film Award, and a Tony. He came closest to experiencing the boxer lifestyle while portraying an ex-boxer in a 1999 production of Tennessee Williams' experimental play, \"Camino Real.\"Sweeney, who recently played International Boxing Hall of Famer Christy Martin in a biopic, told Hawke she had trained in boxing for roughly six months for the role. \n\"You fared better than I did,\" Hawke told Sweeney, the latter of whom suffered a concussion on set.\n            \n    ",

The Bucs play three division games in the final four weeks of the season and need to stack wins in those contests, starting with this one on Thursday night.Atlanta has been on an even bigger slide, losing seven of its last eight games. The Falcons aren't even playing for draft positioning, either, because they traded their first-round pick to the Rams during last year's draft. They are playing out the string here and fighting for jobs next season and in the future.Which of these two teams will be able to stop their recent stretch of poor play? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down some of the key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Buccaneers vs. FalconsDate: Thursday, Dec. 11 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Raymond James Stadium (Tampa, Florida)Stream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -4.5, O/U 44.5 via DraftKings SportsbookKey StorylinesNFC South race. The Buccaneers and Panthers are tied with matching 7-6 records, but the Bucs currently sit in first place in the division thanks to the common opponents tiebreaker. (They haven't played each other yet and they're both 2-1 in the division, so they have to go to the third tiebreaker to decide which team is ahead.) Tampa plays Atlanta here, then travels to Carolina next week and Miami the week after before hosting the Panthers to end the season. The Panthers get the Saints on the road this week before hosting the Bucs and Seahawks and then traveling to Tampa to end the year. Buccaneers injury returns. The Bucs have already gotten Bucky Irving back and now they are getting Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan back as well. Evans has been out since suffering a collarbone injury back in Week 4. McMillan has yet to play this season after suffering a neck injury during the preseason. The Bucs offense has not been as good lately as it was to start the season, so these returns should provide a significant boost.Falcons in a tailspin. Atlanta has lost seven of its last eight games after starting the season 3-2. There could be changes on the horizon if Raheem Morris and Co. can't turn things around down the stretch. Doing so is going to be difficult because they're working with a backup quarterback and a defense that has badly regressed since starting the season as one of the hotter units in the league. If the Falcons continue to stumble, we could see a new head coach and/or general manager in Atlanta next season.Buccaneers vs. Falcons prediction, pick\nTampa isn't exactly lighting the world on fire of late, but the Falcons seem to be dead in the water. Tampa should be able to move the ball on Thursday night, especially with Evans and McMillan returning to from injury. The Falcons, meanwhile, seemingly cannot move the ball with any degree of consistency with Kirk Cousins under center. The Bucs have a good run defense and are weaker against the pass, which plays against what the Falcons would like to do given the current state of their roster. \nPick: Buccaneers 24, Falcons 13 | (Tampa Bay -4.5, Under 44.5)\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol on Thursday, which is how he was able to be a full practice participant ahead of Dallas' \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup with the Minnesota Vikings in Week 15. Lamb is now tracking toward a return to football 10 days after suffering a concussion on \"Thursday Night Football\" at the Detroit Lions in Week 14. His brain injury occurred when his head slammed into the Ford Field turf on an end zone target in which he attempted to make an acrobatic, one-handed catch. Lamb exhibited a fencing response in the immediate aftermath of his concussive blow to the head as his hands and fingers began to make unnatural movements. Despite that moment and it being brought up to Lamb that Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins went right back into concussion protocol in Week 14 against the Buffalo Bills in his first game back from a concussion, he doesn't have any apprehension about the 10-day turnaround from his concussion to his return. \"Man, nah, in a situation like that, bro, as far as getting hurt or getting a concussion, it's not like you're thinking about, 'Oh, what if? What if I get hurt again?' I feel like if you live in that realm and you feed that fuel, it's going to happen,\" Lamb said after practice on Thursday. \"You don't want to live in a realm like that's never going to happen again. Really, it's [about] staying level, just being positive about each and every opportunity you get and just staying blessed. You have to go out there first and play your game and don't really think too much on it. I've been hurt a couple times and I don't dwell on it. I hit my head a couple of times. I don't dwell on it. You have to move on. It's a part of the game. That's why playing football is very important, and that's why taking care of your body is even more important.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 viewer's guide: Top 10 things to watch, including Super Bowl contenders and Philip Rivers comeback\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDallas quarterback Dak Prescott immediately ran up to Lamb on the field in Detroit in the immediate aftermath of the concussion, which is when saw his top target's initial fencing response. That was a cause for immediate concern in the 10-year veteran's eyes, but Prescott isn't worried about Lamb's return on Sunday against the Vikings 10 days later after seeing how he's practiced. \"Yeah, zero concern. Obviously on the field, you see a guy whatever they call that, his hands getting into that formation [a fencing response] right? Whether it's your brother, teammate or somebody on the other team, you don't want to see that. So yeah, obviously there was some urgency to get him help then, but then actually when I got over there, he was almost right back to it. I was like 'you good?' He's like 'yeah,'\" Prescott said Thursday. \"You just could tell just for a moment [that Lamb was out of it]. He was back at it Monday, doing light stuff and working out. From there, I was positive in the way that he would respond, and he's been great.\"The 26-year-old All-Pro claims he hasn't suffered from any residual effects or symptoms regarding the concussion, which is why he's confident in being able to play without concern on Sunday night after completing the protocol.  \n\"Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,\" Lamb said. \"As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest. Doing everything, me knowing my requirements, kind of getting ahead of everything, especially with the extra 2-3 days that we had off. I feel like that was big.\"Hard Knocks' latest episode on Tuesday showed Lamb begging trainers to keep him in the game while being helped off the field with him saying \"Let me play.\" When the injury happened early in the third quarter of an eventual 44-30 Dallas defeat, Lamb was on fire with 121 yards receiving on six catches. He claims to \"remember everything\" from when he suffered his concussion, which is why he asked the training staff to let him play. However, Lamb acknowledged this instance was one where he needed to be protected from himself. \"They're doing their job, and obviously me as a competitor, I want to do mine. But it's times where they do have to protect me from me. That was the situation to where that was one of them. I felt like I was having a pretty good game,\" Lamb said. \"I was just kind of getting started and getting it cooking. ... But again I'm happy for the training staff. I'm happy for everybody that's reached out. ... It was a surreal moment for me and myself and really just a quick experience. It was an opportunity for me to grow up. ... Overall, just always be grateful for each and every opportunity I can step out there.\"\nAs a result, Lamb has been practicing with the Guardian cap over his helmet in practice this week, something he said he had been doing since switching to a new helmet recently. However, he won't be wearing it during game action like Green Bay Packers wide receiver Romeo Doubs does for a simple reason. \"It's not comfortable,\" Lamb said. \nWith just 135 yards receiving across Dallas' final four games, Lamb will join Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Irvin (1991-1995) as the only players in Cowboys history with 1,000 yards receiving in five consecutive seasons. At 6-6-1, Dallas will need much more than that total from Lamb over the next four weeks to somehow backdoor their way into the postseason. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin's return to Ole Miss as the LSU coach will come on Sept. 19 in what figures to be one of the most charged and raucous environments of the 2026 college football season. The game's date was revealed Thursday as the SEC announced its 2026 schedule, which will feature nine league contests for each team.Few will be more anticipated than Ole Miss hosting LSU and Kiffin, who left the Rebels before their 2025 College Football Playoff run to accept the Tigers' head coaching job. While Kiffin elevated Ole Miss to historic levels during his six-year run, his untidy exit for a conference rival relegated him to pariah status in the state of Mississippi.If his return is anything like his exit, Kiffin be on the recipient of intense vitriol at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, which has an official capacity of 64,038.Ole Miss fans sent Kiffin off with a chorus of jeers and one-finger salutes as he boarded a plane in Oxford, Mississippi, bound for LSU two days after the Rebels reached a program-record 11 regular-season victories. It is just the latest dramatic job transition for Kiffin, who tried desperately to rehabilitate his image during his time at Ole Miss.\n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOver roughly a year leading up to his departure, Kiffin added new layers to his public persona by touting his sobriety, improved family life and elevated emotional wellness, achieved in part by a steady devotion to yoga. With Ole Miss surging to a third consecutive 10+ win season behind strong institutional support and Kiffin appearing to have found a once-elusive inner-peace, the idea of a long-term tenure in Oxford seemed possible, if not likely.\nBut when LSU fired Brian Kelly after a 5-3 start, cracks in that foundation multiplied quickly. Already pursued by Florida for its head coaching vacancy, Kiffin suddenly had two SEC programs with multiple 21st century national championships vying for his services.\nEven while attempting to project a \"business as usual\" mantra at Ole Miss, it was clear Kiffin's mind was elsewhere. Members of his family took visits to both Gainesville, Florida, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shortly after the Rebels beat Florida on Nov. 15.Returning to a stadium where he is loathed won't be new for Kiffin, who has been back to Tennessee three times as either Alabama's offensive coordinator or as the Ole Miss head coach since leaving the Volunteers for USC after a one-year stint as the program's head coach in 2009. He will coach at Tennessee again in 2026 as the Tigers travel to Neyland Stadium in 2026 as well. \nHowever, his return to Ole Miss with LSU will mark the first time he's ever coached against the school he left just one season later. That the game is at Ole Miss only adds to the intrigue of what figures to be a wild scene.\n            ",

Anderson took over the head coaching duties on an interim basis after Charles Huff departed earlier this week to fill the Memphis vacancy. He spent the 2025 season on staff as the Golden Eagles' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, marking his second stint with the program after his 2008-11 tenure as an assistant.Anderson's elevation puts him back in charge of a program for the first time since Utah State fired him for cause in 2024. He previously oversaw the Arkansas State and Utah State programs and posted a 74-53 record across the two schools with nine bowl appearances in 10 years. Anderson won the Sun Belt twice with the Red Wolves and the Mountain West once with the Aggies.\"We are excited to announce Blake Anderson as the next leader of our football program,\" Southern Miss athletic director Jeremy McClain said. \"He brings a wealth of experience and a ten-year run as a successful head coach, including multiple conference championships in the Sun Belt, a Mountain West conference championship, and nine bowl appearances. Blake is an exceptional leader, a great communicator, and has the respect of the players and the staff throughout the Duff Center. We look forward to supporting him at the highest level and continuing the positive momentum for our program.\"Utah State fired Anderson just over a month prior to the start of the 2024 season after an internal investigation concluded that he violated university Title IX policies. After an Aggies football player was arrested for alleged domestic violence in April 2023, Utah State said that Anderson did not immediately report the incident to the Office of Equity and instead conducted a personal investigation -- which included the contacting of the player's girlfriend and roommate -- to determine whether punitive action should be taken against the player.\nAnderson filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Utah State, and his lawyers accused the university of leading \"what is essentially a public smear campaign\" against their client.Anderson's coaching experience dates back to 1992 and features numerous stops throughout the Group of Five ranks. He also spent two seasons as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at North Carolina from 2012-13.\nThe best year of Anderson's career came in 2021 when he led Utah State to a Mountain West title and defeated Oregon State in the LA Bowl. The Aggies won 11 games that season, matching a program record. They also cracked the AP Top 25 poll for just the fifth time in program history.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- All things considered, wide receiver George Pickens has been everything the Dallas Cowboys could have hoped for when they acquired him this past offseason in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pickens has been a top-5 to top-10 wide receiver across the entire league in 2025 by just about any metric: catches (78, the seventh-most in the NFL), yards receiving (1,179, the third-most in the NFL), receiving touchdowns (8, tied for the fifth-most in the NFL), receiving first downs (62, the second-most in the NFL) and catches of 25 yards or more (11, tied for the second-most in the NFL). However, the reason the Steelers were willing to part with the uber-talented 24-year-old and a 2027 sixth-round pick in exchange for the Cowboys' 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick reared its head in Dallas' 44-30 \"Thursday Night Football\" road defeat at the Detroit Lions in Week 14. Pickens' attitude that helps make him one of the NFL's toughest covers can also appear to some to sometimes take himself out of the game. He racked up just 37 yards receiving on five catches, his fewest total putting up 30 yards in Week 1 at the Philadelphia Eagles, on a night in which co-No. 1 receiver CeeDee Lamb exited early with a concussion. Retired five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Richard Sherman called Pickens \"uninterested\" when going through some of his routes in Dallas' 44-30 \"Thursday Night Football\" loss in Week 14. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 15 viewer's guide: Top 10 things to watch, including Super Bowl contenders and Philip Rivers comeback\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"George Pickens throughout the game, especially late in the game, just looked uninterested. Uninterested in playing football,\" Sherman said. \"That's what you can't have. If you're going to be a superstar, if you want to be the best receiver in the National Football League, you can't ever be disengaged. It doesn't matter if the game's going your way or not going your way.\"  \nPickens clapped back at Sherman on his Instagram story after the game. \nCowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer met with Pickens about his performance, and he revealed the wide receiver did take accountability for his latest outing. \"We talked a little bit about it. In his words, he said 'Hey Schotty, I didn't play my best game.' I think that, unfortunately, none of us played our best game, so that's reality,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"But again, I don't worry about George and his love for football and playing this game. Again, you know for five or six weeks, he was the talk of the sporting world. 'Look at George Pickens.' We didn't coach or play well enough to win that game in Detroit. They beat us. It is what it is.\"\nDallas All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb has been one of Pickens' biggest proponents since his arrival, and he's been happy to take the 24-year-old under his wing. He wasn't surprised by the criticism Pickens received after the Cowboys road loss in Detroit, but he also didn't see it as justified given Pickens is performing at an All-Pro caliber level in 2025. \"I just feel like they were waiting on him to have a bad game. It was quiet all season, and he was averaging 100, 110 [yards] doing crazy things. But the one opportunity that he didn't step up to their appreciation. I feel like for us to come out victorious [that night], it wasn't just all on him,\" Lamb said after practice on Thursday. \"Once one of us go out, d-coordinators are very smart. It's not like I go out [with a concussion], and they stay playing the same coverage. They're going to lean coverage to him. ... They're going to do different things. People are smart. People understand football. ... People don't want to get fired, and they know if they let G[eorge] spin by himself, somebody's getting fired.\"Lamb can also relate to being the target of Sherman's disdain in recent years. In 2023, Lamb and Dallas' offense started slow, and Sherman said the Cowboys' latest No. 88 wasn't a \"bonafide\" top tier wideout. He ended that season with an NFL-best 135 catches, 1,749 yards receiving (the second-most in the NFL) and 12 receiving touchdowns (the third-most in the NFL). That's why he's taken it upon himself to be there for Pickens at this moment. \n\"Man, I've been in that position. I know what he's feeling. I've talked to him, and I'm not going to tell you what we talked about but as far as … it just kind of gets annoying as a player because like you do everything for your team. Mind you, we are here 10 and 12 hours a day. We are putting our work in every single day. Every day we work hard at practice, trying to get the timing down and everything,\" Lamb said. \"Then you get in the game, and the coverage just switches or you get a sudden change and somebody gets taken out, you can't prepare for those things. That's not something that you can just do weekly, 'All right, well what if he goes down? What if he does this?' No, that's not how it goes. As a football player you know you got to adjust and the defense did a great job. They did a great job of cutting 3 [Pickens] out. That's it. That simple.\"Lamb's mindset on Pickens is shared all the way up to the top of the Cowboys org chart by owner and general manager Jerry Jones. Dallas' big boss made it unequivocally clear that he doesn't have any issue with Pickens' mindset or attitude. \"Let me say this. One of the things that you got to appreciate about George Pickens is his intensity for the competition. He is a major, big-time competitor. Those are not the kind of things you hear addressed when you're thinking of things that George could do better on,\"  Jones said Tuesday on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas. \"When it comes to competing, when it comes to loving the game, and I emphasize that point right there -- loving the game -- then I give him many pluses. ... I look at what George Pickens has done all year. ... Just so I'm real clear about it, I don't have any concern about the debate about what George Pickens did or didn't do in that game. I don't have that concern about him as far as his competing and helping us win football games on the field. At all.\"\nThat's been borne out with the way Pickens' teammates have seen him approach the week of practice ahead of a pivotal \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup with the Minnesota Vikings. With a 6-6-1 record, the Cowboys' narrow path to a postseason berth will require them to win all four of their remaining regular season games and receive help from a few different places. Ending the year on a four-game winning streak will require Pickens' best foot forward. \"He's responded great. Just came in like a pro, as I expected him to do. ... When you're playing to the level he is and to the standard, what he put out there is not to his standard or anybody's expectations when you play the way that he does,\" Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said after practice on Thursday. ... \"He's had a hell of a week of practice, and he's going to continue to finish that way. There's no doubt all that is going to just transpire into the game.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nMidway through the 2025 NFL season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers appeared to be in control of the NFC South. With four games remaining, they are in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2019.Tampa Bay (7-6), which won six of its first eight contests to build a two-game division lead over Carolina, has lost four of five and finds itself in a dogfight with the Panthers (7-6) for first place. The Buccaneers, who face Carolina twice over the final three weeks of the campaign and currently own the tiebreaker between the clubs, look to maintain the upper hand in the battle when they open Week 15 against the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday Night Football at Raymond James Stadium.The Buccaneers are coming off a surprising 24-20 home loss to the New Orleans Saints in which Baker Mayfield completed less than half of his pass attempts (14-of-30) for only 122 yards. Atlanta has lost seven of its last eight games, including a 37-9 drubbing at the hands of the Seattle Seahawks in Week 14, but is hoping to avenge a 23-20 home setback against Tampa Bay in the season opener.Four games are on Thursday's NBA schedule, including a matchup between the Portland Trail Blazers (9-15) and New Orleans Pelicans (3-22) at 8 p.m. ET at the Smoothie King Center. Portland is wrapping up a five-game road trip during which it lost three of the first four contests, while New Orleans is looking to halt a seven-game losing streak.The NHL has 13 contests on its slate, one of which has the Atlantic Division-leading Detroit Red Wings (17-11-3) visiting Rogers Place for a meeting with the Edmonton Oilers (13-11-6) at 9 p.m. ET. Detroit is 3-0-1 on its six-game road trip, while Edmonton has gone 2-1-1 on its five-game homestand.Thursday's 13-game college basketball schedule features a clash between Iowa (8-1) and fourth-ranked Iowa State (9-0) at 8 p.m. ET at the Hilton Coliseum in Ames, Ia. The Hawkeyes' lone loss came in their only true road game of the season and they now visit a Cyclones squad that is 4-0 at home.The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites against the Falcons in the latest consensus NFL odds. Meanwhile, the Trail Blazers are 4.5-point favorites against the Pelicans, the Oilers are -180 favorites on the money line versus the Red Wings and Iowa State is a 10.5-point favorite against Iowa.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Thursday, Dec. 11. All times EasternNFL best bets, where to watchFalcons at BuccaneersTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Tampa, Fla. | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 44 (-112) | Expert: Falcons +4.5 (-105, R.J. White)Both teams are in the bottom half of the NFL in scoring, with the Buccaneers averaging 23 points and the Falcons producing 19.4 per game. But five of Atlanta's last six games have gone Over the projected total for Thursday's showdown and Tampa Bay was involved in shootouts with the New England Patriots (51 total points) and Buffalo Bills (76) during its current funk. The Buccaneers' offense could receive a spark as wideout Mike Evans may return from the broken collarbone that has sidelined him for six games, and fellow receiver Jalen McMillan (neck) might make his season debut. The SportsLine Projection Model is leaning toward the Over, which hits in 51% of its simulations, and SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White (+1321 on his last 265 NFL picks) likes the Falcons to cover the spread as only two of the Bucs' seven wins this season were by more than three points.\nNBA best bets, where to watchTrail Blazers at PelicansTime: 8 p.m. | Location: New Orleans | TV: League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 241 (-112) | Expert: Trail Blazers -179 (Tim Doyle)Portland is in the middle of the pack in the league with an average of 117.4 points and is coming off a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies in which it was held under triple digits (96) for just the second time this season. New Orleans had a rare offensive surge last time out, scoring 132 points in Monday's setback against the San Antonio Spurs, but has produced 113 per game in 2025-26. The Trail Blazers and Pelicans combined for 242 points in their first meeting this campaign, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see this matchup reaching that total as its simulations say the Under hits more than 66% of the time. SportsLine basketball expert Tim Doyle (+318 on his last five NBA picks) believes Portland will post its fifth victory in 17 games as it has had three days off since its 23-point loss at Memphis.NHL best bets, where to watchRed Wings at OilersTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Edmonton | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Oilers -180 | Expert: Oilers -1 (-123, Matt Severance)The Red Wings have posted three consecutive victories and earned points in six straight contests (4-0-2). They're coming off a 4-3 triumph over the Flames in Calgary on Wednesday, but they've played on back-to-back nights four times thus far this season and lost the second game on three occasions - including both times when each of the consecutive contests were on the road. The SportsLine Projection Model thinks that trend will continue as Edmonton wins in 64% of its simulations, and SportsLine expert Matt Severance is backing the Oilers to cover the spread as he feels playing for the second time in two nights again will be too much for Detroit.CBB best bets, where to watchIowa at Iowa StateTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa +10.5 (-110) | Expert: Under 143.5 (-110, Bruce Marshall)Sure, Iowa State has recorded eight of its nine victories this season by 16 or more points and is coming off a 23-point triumph over then-No. 1 Purdue. And yes, Iowa's only loss this campaign was a 19-point setback against the only ranked team (then-No. 7 Michigan State) it has faced thus far in 2025-26. But the Hawkeyes are second in the Big Ten with an average of 62.6 points allowed and are limiting opponents to 43.6% shooting. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Hawkeyes can do enough defensively against the Cyclones, as its simulations have them covering the spread 60% of the time. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+185 on his last six college basketball picks) also thinks Iowa can slow down Iowa State and is backing the Under.\n            ",

    "body": "\nA stretch during which they lost five of seven games put the Pittsburgh Steelers in danger of falling out of first place in the AFC North. But Mike Tomlin's club withstood a late comeback attempt by the Baltimore Ravens last week to post a 27-22 road victory and remain atop the division. The Steelers attempt to strengthen their hold on first place in Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season when they host the streaking Miami Dolphins at Acrisure Stadium on Monday Night Football.It appeared as if Pittsburgh (7-6) would run away and capture its first division title since 2020 as it won four of its first five games and owned a 2 1/2-game lead after Week 6. That advantage was aided by a 2-4 start by the Cincinnati Bengals, who lost quarterback Joe Burrow for more than two months to a toe injury in Week 2, and 1-5 beginnings by both the Ravens and Cleveland Browns.However, the Steelers won only two of their following six contests, while Baltimore reeled off five consecutive victories to pull even with Pittsburgh in the standings at 6-5. The teams remained tied as both lost in Week 13, and the Steelers owned an 11-point lead after three quarters in their showdown last Sunday and held on for the win to move one game ahead of the Ravens with four remaining.\nWideout DK Metcalf had his best performance since being acquired by Pittsburgh last March after spending the first six years of his NFL career with the Seattle Seahawks, hauling in seven passes for 148 yards. But the Steelers' 29th-ranked ground attack (89.2 yards) produced only 34 yards while their defense allowed Baltimore to rush for 217.Pittsburgh is 21st in the league against the run (125.3 yards allowed) but even worse defending the pass, as it ranks 28th with an average of 244 yards allowed through the air. The club also is 28th in total defense (369.3 yards allowed) but sixth with 36 sacks. The Steelers could have trouble recording one against Miami as three-time NFL sack leader T.J. Watt, who is first on the team this year with seven, was hospitalized Wednesday because of a lung issue and could miss Monday's contest.The Dolphins (6-7) were left for dead after losing six of their first seven games this season but have come out of nowhere to ever so slightly get back into the playoff picture. They have won four straight contests and five of their last six, although four of those victories came against teams with records of 4-9 or worse.Miami is one of the better rushing clubs in the league, as it ranks eighth with an average of 126.5 yards per game. The ground assault is led by De'Von Achane, who is third in the NFL with a career-high 1,126 yards. The 24-year-old posted three consecutive 100-yard performances and was on his way to a fourth straight last week as he gained 92 yards before leaving in the second quarter of a 34-10 rout of the New York Jets with a rib injury.Achane is questionable for the matchup against the Steelers, but the Dolphins historically don't perform well in cold weather. The high temperature in Pittsburgh for Monday is 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and it certainly will be below that at game time. The weather is of no concern to SportsLine's Inside the Lines team, which doesn't foresee Miami qualifying for the postseason regardless of the outcome of Monday night's contest. The ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, currently gives the Dolphins a 0.1% chance of making the playoffs and puts that number at 0.3% should they defeat the Steelers.Meanwhile, the model strongly believes the Steelers will make their third consecutive postseason appearance and fifth in six years. It puts Pittsburgh's chances at more than 73% and increases them to just over 79% with a victory on Monday. However, with the Steelers trailing four teams - including the three that occupy wild card berths - by at least one game, the model feels their best method of going to the playoffs is winning a division title.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCEPittsburgh Steelers73.5%79.2%62.2%17.0%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC NORTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCEPittsburgh Steelers73.2%78.6%62.2%16.4%Baltimore Ravens23.9%36.7%9.7%27.0%Pittsburgh follows its Monday night matchup with road games against the Detroit Lions and Browns before ending the regular season at home versus Baltimore. The Ravens visit Cincinnati this Sunday, face the AFC East-leading New England Patriots in their home finale a week later and visit the Green Bay Packers before what could be a crucial showdown in the \"Steel City.\"The Steelers lost their last meeting with the Dolphins, a 16-10 setback at Miami in 2022, but have won the last two matchups between the teams in Pittsburgh - including their clash in the 2016 wild card round. Pittsburgh is a 3.5-point favorite against Miami on Monday in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 26-19 victory for the Steelers, which would move them one step closer to the 25th division title in franchise history.\n            ",

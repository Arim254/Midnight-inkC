Kalshi prices the Celtics to score more than 116.5 points at $0.44 per share.The model also has a pair of NBA player props it's backing, including Rockets forward Kevin Durant to have six or more rebounds ($0.45 per share) and Spurs guard Stephon Castle to score 15 points or more ($0.57). Claim your $10 cash bonus after $10 in trades at Kalshi here with the Kalshi promo code CBSSPORTS:For the full terms and conditions and how to claim the promo, read our Kalshi promo code review.How to claim the Kalshi promo codeNew users can use the Kalshi promo code to claim this offer.

He's scored at least 15 points in five of his last six games, not including the Lakers' contest, as the second-year guard and No. 4 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft appears to be feeling more confident in the offense. The Spurs play the Raptors, who could have tired legs in the second half of a back-to-back, as the model projects Castle for 15.9 points on Wednesday. Back Castle with the latest Kalshi promo code, which gives new users a a $10 bonus after $10 in trades:Kevin Durant, Rockets 6 or more rebounds ($0.45 per share)Amen Thompson, a 6-foot-7 guard, is out for the Rockets, and he averages 7.6 rebounds per game, which opens up more rebounding opportunities for Durant. Even with Thompson in the lineup, Durant has at least six rebounds in two of three games since the NBA All-Star Break, with five boards in the other. He's averaging 5.4 rebounds per game this season, but the model likes his chances at getting at least that sixth rebound with Thompson out in a matchup against a 13-46 Kings team. The Kings are 30th in the league in 3-point shooting and 29th in two-point shooting percentage, so there should be plenty of rebounding opportunities for Durant. The model projects Durant for 6.8 rebounds. Back Durant with the latest Kalshi promo code, which gives new users a a $10 bonus after $10 in trades:Celtics more than 116.5 points scored vs. Nuggets ($0.44 per share)The Nuggets have allowed at least 117 points in six of their last nine games, and the Celtics have broken the 120-point margin in two of their last four contests. Boston averages just below this total for the season at 115 ppg, and the Nuggets are allowing 116.3 ppg. Denver allowed 128 points to Golden State on Sunday, and even in two of the three games in which its opponents failed to reach 117 points, the Nuggets allowed at least 114 points. The model projects the Celtics to score 120 points on Wednesday, and especially given this price, it sees solid value in backing Boston to score more than 116.5 points. Back the Celtics with the latest Kalshi promo code, which gives new users a a $10 bonus after $10 in trades:\n            ",

Even with SGA still out and the Thunder playing the Pistons, who have the second-best record in the NBA, the model has the Thunder covering as 7.5-point underdogs at 7 p.m. ET as one of its Wednesday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The model is also backing the Boston Celtics to upset the Denver Nuggets at +140 odds in Wednesday NBA best bets.

The reigning NBA champions are proving they are more than a one-man band, going 6-3 while last year's NBA MVP is out with a strained abdominal muscle. The Thunder are coming off a 116-107 win over the Raptors on Tuesday after defeating the Cavaliers, 121-113, on Sunday for back-to-back wins over top-five Eastern Conference teams. The top-seeded Pistons provide a tougher challenge, but given how the Thunder have played lately, the model certainly doesn't project a lopsided contest. The Thunder cover in 65% of simulations. Back the Thunder at DraftKings here:Celtics (+140) to defeat the NuggetsDenver has the rest advantage with the Celtics playing the second half of a back-to-back, but Boston had a relatively easy victory against the Suns, 97-81, resulting in no player needing to play more than 34 minutes. The Celtics have won four straight and are 9-1 over their last 10 games. They are 3-0 over the start of their West Coast road trip, with wins over the Warriors, Lakers and Suns. Meanwhile, the Nuggets are just 3-3 over their last six games and 3-6 over their last nine contests. Boston (38-19) has the second-best record in the NBA despite playing without Jayson Tatum (Achilles) all season, and the model projects another winning performance on Wednesday. The Celtics win in 55% of simulations, showcasing strong value at these odds. Back the Celtics at DraftKings here:Navy (-7.5) vs. Loyola (-110)\"Navy has a four-game lead in the Patriot League, and they've covered 18 games on the season, which ranks sixth-best,\" SportsLine expert Micah Roberts said. \"Navy is 9-4 in away games, and they've covered five straight against Loyola-Maryland.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Cleveland Cavaliers announced that star guard James Harden suffered a fractured right thumb during Cleveland's 109-94 win over the New York Knicks Tuesday night. Harden played 32 minutes and finished with 20 points, four assists and two rebounds, but a subsequent evaluation of his thumb confirmed the fracture. It's unclear how long Harden will be sidelined -- if at all. Rather than already being ruled out, Harden is listed as questionable for Wednesday night's matchup with the Milwaukee Bucks, the second night of a back-to-back. The team said Harden will continue to undergo treatment and evaluations for the injury. Given it's Harden's non-shooting hand, there is a chance he could still play despite any added difficulties the injury may bring.\"A postgame examination by the Cavaliers' medical staff, followed by X-rays taken [Wednesday], confirmed a non-displaced fracture of the distal phalanx,\" the team said. \"Harden will undergo treatment and continued evaluation. An update on his status will be provided as appropriate.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NBA MVP Rankings: Victor Wembanyama jumps into top three, Cade Cunningham could win by default\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFrom the initial announcement, it sounds like Cleveland avoided a complete disaster with Harden not being immediately ruled out for a significant amount of time. The Cavs have gone 6-1 since trading for Harden in early February. He has established immediate chemistry with Donovan Mitchell in the backcourt, giving Cleveland someone who can take offensive pressure off Mitchell in a way Darius Garland couldn't.Harden is averaging 18.9 points, eight rebounds and 4.6 assists per game as a member of the Cavs. Before the trade, he averaged 25.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.8 assists in 44 games for the Los Angeles Clippers this season.\nCleveland (37-22) is tied with the Knicks for third in the East. If Harden has to miss time, they could slip in the standings as the Toronto Raptors (34-24) sit just 2.5 games behind them. Dropping a spot in the standings would be a small price to pay if it means having a fully healthy Harden available for the postseason. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Colorado coach Deion Sanders was forced to shuffle his staff ahead of spring practice after defensive coordinator Robert Livingston was hired by the Denver Broncos as their new defensive pass game coordinator, per ESPN. Livingston spent the past two seasons leading the Buffaloes' defense, including their nine-win season in 2024, but is now heading back to the NFL. Livingston worked for the Cincinnati Bengals, first as a scout and then as a defensive assistant, from 2012 to 2023 before joining Sanders' staff in Boulder. Livingston spent two seasons working under Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph early in his career. Livingston's departure is a significant blow for Colorado, and Sanders has elevated linebackers coach Chris Marve to the defensive coordinator, according to multiple reports. Marve previously was the defensive coordinator at Virginia Tech from 2022-24 before coming to Colorado.

The Buffs went 4-8 in Year 1 before a breakthrough 9-4 record in 2024. After last year's stumble, Sanders proclaimed that he's the \"right man for the job\" in Boulder while outgoing athletic director Rick George consistently backed his coach.\n        \n            \n                Big 12 football power rankings 2026: Texas Tech, BYU remain on top while Utah falls back to pack\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast month, Colorado hired Fernando Lovo from New Mexico as its new athletic director after George decided to transition into an advisory role.

With a new athletic director in place, Sanders faces pressure to deliver a turnaround for the program in 2026. And now he'll do it without Livingston, his proven defensive coordinator.\nSanders has to hope Marve is the right man to lead a new-look defense that took on 25 transfers in this year's portal window in an effort to bounce back and build out that side of the ball. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Arizona Cardinals signal-caller Kyler Murray is one of the most interesting quarterbacks to watch this offseason. After an injury opened the door for what felt like a soft benching in 2025, it appears the two sides are destined for a split.Cardinals general manager Monti Ossenfort told reporters at the NFL Scouting Combine that he's had \"good dialogue\" with Murray about what's next, and that \"all options are on the table for us.\" However, ESPN reports that Murray and the Cardinals haven't spoken since the season ended. Murray played in just five games in 2025 due to a foot injury, winning two. He completed 68.3% of his passes for 962 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions. When he exited the lineup, Jacoby Brissett came in and was more efficient, averaging 280.5 passing yards per game in his 12 starts compared to Murray's 192.4.\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL offseason matchmaker for QB-needy teams: Fernando Mendoza to Raiders, Kyler Murray on the move\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMurray signed a five-year, $230.5 million extension in 2022, and the Cardinals have to make a decision on his future prior to the fifth day of the new league year, when he receives $19.5 million guaranteed in the form of a 2027 roster bonus. If Murray were to be released with a post-June 1 designation, the Cardinals would take on $47.5 million in dead cap this year, $7.2 million in dead cap next year, and save $5.1 million in 2026 per Spotrac. \nWe know how electric of an athlete Murray is when he's healthy. He made the Pro Bowl in 2020 and 2021, and got Arizona to the playoffs once. He's not yet 30 years old, so could Murray become the next Sam Darnold with a change of scenery? Let's take a look at five potential landing spots for Murray.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    There are some New York Jets fans out there who aren't excited to ride the veteran quarterback carousel again after the Justin Fields disaster last year, but Murray is a much more experienced player than Fields. Plus, what rookie intrigues those in New York? Dante Moore is staying in college, Fernando Mendoza is likely going No. 1 overall to the Las Vegas Raiders and it's hard to tell if Ty Simpson is a first-round pick right now. New York probably isn't considering him with the No. 2 overall pick. Malik Willis may be the top free-agent quarterback this offseason, but if the Jets miss out on him, Murray could bring some level of stability to the Jets offense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Minnesota Vikings appear to be in the market for a veteran quarterback after J.J. McCarthy's struggles last year. In his first full NFL season, McCarthy averaged 163.2 passing yards and threw 11 touchdowns with 12 interceptions. He finished last in completion percentage (57.6%) and passer rating (72.6) among quarterbacks with at least 10 starts. I don't think the Vikings are ready to totally give up on their No. 10 overall pick, and I'm not saying they should be, but bringing in a veteran to at least compete with McCarthy is a good idea.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    It looked like the Pittsburgh Steelers were ready to embrace the organizational reset the franchise had put off for years, but then they hired Mike McCarthy, who is considering bringing Aaron Rodgers back. If Rodgers does end up retiring, then Murray could be an option for Pittsburgh. Perhaps fans are hoping for a young quarterback that could be their long-term signal-caller, but could that not be Murray? No, he's not 22 years old, but not many viewed Darnold as a lock to be the long-term option for the Seattle Seahawks when he signed with them last year. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Cardinals and Miami Dolphins could just trade quarterbacks. That's a joke, because it wouldn't make sense from a contractual standpoint. But Miami may be in the market for a veteran quarterback this offseason after likely moving on from Tua Tagovailoa, and Murray does make some sense as the Dolphins prepare for a rebuild. New general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan said that the Dolphins will draft a quarterback this offseason, but that he is also excited for what Quinn Ewers is capable of. That doesn't mean signing someone like Murray is completely off the table, though.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Here's an interesting one. The Atlanta Falcons are expected to move on from Kirk Cousins, and Michael Penix Jr. is recovering from a torn ACL suffered just three months ago. If I were Matt Ryan and Kevin Stefanski, I would be in the market for a quarterback. It's not like Penix has been a revelation either. He's 4-8 as a starter, and has two 300-yard games compared to four starts where he failed to cross 200 yards passing. The Falcons are a team that could be in the market for a veteran starter -- if the price is right. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's no guarantee J.J. McCarthy will start at quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings during the 2026 season, that revelation coming this week from executive vice president of football operations Rob Brzezinski, who said at the NFL combine the franchise is are \"exploring all possibilities\" at the position.The Vikings watched eventual Super Bowl champion Sam Darnold sign with the Seattle Seahawks as a free agent last March after hitching their wagon to McCarthy, a former 2024 first-round pick who was inconsistent during his first campaign as a starter.McCarthy finished with 1,632 yards passing, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions over 10 games, going 6-4 overall after missing his rookie season with a knee injury.\"What we do know is we need a level of baseline quarterback play for us to be effective,\" Brzezinski said. \"A lot of this has been J.J. in unfortunate (situations) with some of the injuries and things that he's dealt with, but we're going to explore every opportunity, and I don't think there's anything specifically we're looking for. We can't manufacture anything that's not there. So No. 1, what are the options? Is it reciprocal? Is it financially doable? All those things. There's just a lot of factors that go into it.\"\nNeither Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell, nor Brzezinski, endorsed McCarthy as Minnesota's expected starter during separate interviews in Indianapolis this week. O'Connell did say he felt like McCarthy, who missed the team's regular-season finale in January with a hand injury, could still be a franchise quarterback.O'Connell was previously a firm believer in the former Michigan standout to lead his offense after Minnesota selected him at No. 10 overall two years ago in the draft.\"It's just the timeline is in a different place for all of us than it was at that point,\" O'Connell said this week, via ESPN. \"And I have a responsibility -- we have a responsibility collectively as we put together this team -- to make sure that we use the data that we have at this time and the experiences we have, the feelings that we've had at different times as an organization.\"\nMcCarthy is signed through the 2027 on his four-year rookie deal which includes $21.8 million guaranteed. Brzezinski said the team was not\" ruling anything out\" with their plan at quarterback. Aaron Rodgers is a free agent, along with Malik Willis. There's an expectation Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray could be as well since he hasn't spoken with the team since the end of the season.The Indianapolis Colts have a decision to make with Daniel Jones. He's set to hit free agency unless the team franchise tags him or gets him to agree to a new deal.Each of these signal callers could be potential targets for the Vikings if they're not comfortable with moving forward with McCarthy as QB1 for next season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Chicago Bears are exploring parting ways with one of their defensive starters, as the franchise granted permission to linebacker Tremaine Edmunds to seek a trade, per the Chicago Tribune. Edmunds, who turns 28 in May, enters the final year of the four-year, $72 million contract he signed with Chicago in 2023. He's due $15 million in cash with a $17.4 million cap hit in 2026, per Spotrac. Whether the Bears trade or cut Edmunds, they stand to save around $15 million by parting ways with him. Despite missing four games due to a groin injury, Edmunds led the Bears in 2025 with 112 tackles to go along with nine passes defensed, four interceptions and one sack. Edmunds has crossed 100 tackles in all eight of his NFL seasons since being selected by the Buffalo Bills with the No. 16 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, and made back-to-back Pro Bowls in 2019 and 2020.The Bears went 11-6 in the first year of the Ben Johnson era, clinched the NFC North for the first time since 2018, and won their first playoff game since the 2010 campaign with Lovie Smith. Dennis Allen's defense recorded 33 takeaways, which led the NFL, while the Bears set an NFL record by registering seven wins when trailing in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter, including playoffs. \nEdmunds may not be the only notable player Chicago eventually trades or releases this offseason, as general manager Ryan Poles admitted that he has to \"look at all the different scenarios\" when asked about wide receiver DJ Moore at the NFL Scouting Combine. Moore carries a $28.5 million cap hit in 2026, which is the highest on Chicago's salary cap table. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        There are few nicknames in sports that have been more fitting than Kobe Bryant and the \"Black Mamba,\" but five years before Bryant adopted that nickname, Nike tried to give it to Michael Jordan. In a fascinating new feature, ESPN's Baxter Holmes dove into how Nike created an entire ad campaign for the Air Jordan 19 around the black mamba to highlight the Tech Flex material that resembled snake skin. They were going to compare the black mamba's speed and deadly strike to Jordan on the court. The campaign even went public briefly, including a two-page print ad in a 2004 issue of ESPN the Magazine, but never appeared again at the request of Jordan. The reason? Jordan is apparently terrified of snakes, but didn't want that to be public knowledge. \"He was terrified,\" 'Rare Air' author Mark Vancil once said. \"If you watched TV with him and a snake came on, he'd change the channel. And [Jordan] goes, 'If you write that, somebody's going to get killed because somebody's going to throw a snake one day.'\"Jordan's phobia of snakes meant the campaign and any plans to dub him the black mamba were killed, and they pivoted away. \nA few years later, Bryant took on the \"Black Mamba\" moniker and ran with it -- as the story goes, he was inspired by watching the black mamba scene in Kill Bill Vol. 2 -- turning it into one of the all-time great nicknames in sports. The organic nature of Bryant's embrace of being the Black Mamba made it work as a nickname, and the timeline backs up it being a mere coincidence. The Black Mamba was first referenced in relation to Kobe in an ESPN profile of Bryant in 2005 and then in the famous SLAM cover with Bryant in 2006, only becoming part of Nike's campaign with him in 2007. Ultimately, it all worked out for all parties. By 2002, Jordan was not in need of a new nickname and he's certainly not had any problems selling shoes without it. Bryant, on the other hand, was able to turn the Black Mamba into not just a nickname but his alter ego on the court -- going so far as to hiss like a snake when he wanted the ball. \nStill, it's a truly wild \"what if?\" in the basketball and sneaker world if Jordan hadn't been terrified of snakes and had taken the Black Mamba nickname for himself, years before Bryant. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been almost five years and you can still trace so much of what's gone wrong for the Los Angeles Lakers back to the Russell Westbrook trade. It was the last time they truly went all-in on the LeBron James-Anthony Davis core, and when the deal went south, there was no shortage of reporting about the role their two superstars played in making the trade happen. Ever since, there's been a perpetual sense of kicking the can down the road.When they failed to make a win-now move at the 2022 deadline, President of Basketball Operations Rob Pelinka said \"you can't force another team\" to make a trade. At media day that September, when asked about the team's two remaining tradable first-round picks, he preached caution by saying \"you have one shot to make a trade with multiple picks.\" They wound up dealing one pick in 2023, but otherwise kept the powder dry for the next few years, with Pelinka insisting \"if the right deal comes along and we have to put in draft picks, we will\" in 2024 before reminding fans of the challenges of existing in \"Apron World.\"They finally dealt another pick when Luka Dončić was presented to them on a silver platter. They swung big on Mark Williams days later, but rescinded the deal over medical concerns. He's gone on to have a great year in Phoenix, and after the Lakers were knocked out of the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves, Pelinka likened rebuilding around Dončić during the season to \"trying to build an airplane in the sky.\" The 2025 offseason should have been a launching off point. Yet the Lakers acquired no players who figure to be long-term starters around Dončić. They made only a minor move at the 2026 deadline, turning a second-round pick into Luke Kennard. Pelinka argued that being picky was actually a form of aggression. \"I would say we were aggressive. And one form of being aggressive is saying no to moves that come your way that might not be best for the short- and long-term future,\" he argued. Patience is probably the prudent course in theory. In practice, it's going to be tough to stomach another preventable first-round exit. There has been a palpable sense since the Westbrook trade that the Lakers haven't made the most of their star cores, whether it was the James-Davis version of the team or the budding Dončić-Austin Reaves core they have now. In a league filled with creative and unexpected blockbusters, the Lakers make excuses about why they haven't been able to maximize the stars that they've had. The other teams want too much. The aprons are too restricting. The coach is the problem. That's why Pelinka's been around to hire four of them.\nEven if there's truth to this, it's rung pretty hollow in light of the mistakes the Lakers keep making on the margins. Keeping picks doesn't seem as prudent when you're wasting them on Jalen Hood-Schifino and Dalton Knecht. The second apron didn't even exist when they let Alex Caruso leave for less than the full mid-level exception. The never-ending pipeline of disappointing former lottery picks from their original teams to Los Angeles has led to far more misses than hits. As they prioritize these bigger names, they keep letting successful finds on the margins like Scotty Pippen Jr., Jay Huff and Jordan Goodwin slip through their fingers.The excuses are a bit more palatable when a front office has earned trust. Laker fans, with good reason, have lost most of their trust in the Pelinka-led outfit the Lakers have relied on for almost a decade. So when Dodgers owner Mark Walter bought the team and reports of front office change followed, quite a few of those fans were eager for a new lead basketball executive.But according to new chief business executive Lon Rosen, who spoke to reporters Tuesday, that isn't happening. Pelinka will remain in his role as head of basketball operations for the Lakers with input from top Dodgers executives Andrew Friedman and Farhan Zaidi and a presumably beefed-up front office underneath him. The Lakers fired most of their scouting staff earlier this season, and were known around the league for having a very small front office and support staff under the ownership of the Buss family. The idea for now seems to be building up the team's infrastructure, but not making a change at the absolute top.\n\n        \n            \n                The pros of Lakers' LeBron James era outweigh the cons, despite Jeanie Buss' reported frustrations\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhether or not that decision proves to be the correct one will play out over time, but what's clear at this point is that the time for excuses should be long over. Pelinka has every conceivable advantage going into the 2026 offseason.His roster, aside from the Dončić-Reaves star duo, is basically a blank slate. There are a few scattered contracts (such as the regrettable extension Pelinka gave Jarred Vanderbilt or the player option he gave Deandre Ayton), but the Lakers are set for around $47 million or so in cap space if they want it. Can't force other teams to trade with you? You have three tradable picks now. The draft misses, with a new scouting staff coming, can't continue. The aprons may constrain every team, but if the way the Dodgers spend is any indication, the luxury tax won't be a concern anymore. Letting players like Caruso walk for nothing should no longer be an issue. Dončić will be entering his third season as a Laker. The plane is safely on the ground. It's time to refuel so it can take off.Even some of the more nebulous concerns are starting to fade away. The Lakers were at one point so closely aligned with Klutch Sports that its CEO, Rich Paul, referred to the team as \"us.\" James and Davis, the two stars that reportedly pushed for the Westbrook trade, are Paul clients. But Davis is gone. James is set to be a free agent this offseason, and if he leaves, it's hard to imagine they'll hold onto his son, Bronny, who hasn't shown much in two seasons. The only two Paul clients remaining on the roster would thereafter be Vanderbilt and Adou Thiero, two reserves. Dončić reportedly has been far more patient with the Lakers than James typically has been, and he even recruited Marcus Smart in free agency. There's seemingly less concern here about agent or player overreach. The front office, at least for now, is getting left to do its job.\n\n        \n            \n                Will LeBron James return to Cavaliers? How Cleveland reunion would work and why rumors will only get louder\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNot every team would have been as forgiving of Pelinka's last several years as the Lakers have been. General managers have been fired for far less than the Westbrook debacle. Plenty of owners would've gotten sick of the excuses. Pelinka has managed to survive the turbulent end to the James-Davis era and find himself at the start of a new one with just about every leg up an executive could ask for. The Lakers have an MVP candidate. They have a secondary star. They have draft picks and cap space. They have the Los Angeles market to recruit with, ownership with a proven track record in another sport and an eagerness to spend, and a franchise player that seems eager to collaborate.It's put-up-or-shut-up time. No more excuses. No more kicking the can down the road. Pelinka is staying in his position for now. If he's going to prove he deserves to stay there, he needs to take advantage of this opportunity and get the Lakers into the championship mix as quickly as possible.\n            ",

Yeah, yeah, I know they \"have to show it in the playoffs,\" but let's call it what it is: San Antonio is a top-tier contender because the Spurs are an incredibly well-rounded and deep team with a player in Victor Wembanyama who geometrically alters an NBA floor to a degree we haven't seen since prime Stephen Curry. Curry expanded the space you had to cover. Wembanyama, who turned what has always been a clear distance of separation into blocked shots, shrinks the space in which you have to operate. It changes everything, including this so-called \"have to take all the steps\" timeline everyone loves to call a championship requirement. The 2015 Warriors won one playoff series with Curry before jumping from 51 wins to 67 and winning the whole thing. \nI'm not saying the Spurs will do that, but if they don't it won't be because they're not ready. The West is just a torture chamber. Only one team can survive. But that's still a month and change down the road. Right now, there is no way to call the Spurs, who have won nine straight and beaten the Thunder four times, anything other than the best team in the league. With that, let's get to this week's Power Rankings. Note: As a general Power Rankings rule, we're going to try to strike a balance between what we've seen in the last week, the season as a whole so far, and what can reasonably be expected to play out over the rest of the season. This week there is a greater emphasis on that last factor after the trade deadline has passed and given us a clear picture of where every roster officially stands. We will not go so far as to rank these teams based on championship expectations, because in that case it would take a lot more to alter, at least in tiers, the generally accepted hierarchy. Winning matters, and it will get you on the move up this board form week to week. But if you're beating bad teams, just as an example, and probably playing a little above your head, it's not necessarily going to be reflected in a completely commensurate climb up the rankings. Or vice versa.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                5\n            \n                Heat\n            \n                5\n            \n                Nuggets\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Spurs\n                                \n                            San Antonio has won nine straight, a stretch that includes wins over both conferences' top seeds.

The Pistons blasted the Knicks (again) without Jalen Duren or Isaiah Stewart. Cade Cunningham may very well end up winning MVP. Tough, old-school defense is their backbone, but as we saw in the loss to San Antonio on Monday, when Cade isn't dominating they don't really have any other way to create offense. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            42-14\n                        \n                                3\n                            \n                                    Thunder\n                                \n                            OKC has come way back to earth since its 24-1 start, going 21-13 since. Still good, but injuries have hit the Thunder hard. Jalen Williams missed the first month of the season and has played just three times over the past five weeks. SGA has missed eight straight games. Still, the Thunder took care of the surging Cavs without J-Will or SGA and have the best record in the league thanks to that dominant start through the easiest portion of their schedule. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            45-14\n                        \n                                4\n                            \n                                    Celtics\n                                \n                            The Celtics have won nine of their last 10.

The highest-scoring third-quarter team in the league, they took apart the Knicks coming out of halftime on Tuesday and rolled to their 15th win in their last 18 games. ...But then news broke Wednesday afternoon that Harden has a fractured thumb on his non-shooting hand. We'll see how long he's sidelined, but it could be a blow for a team that's finally clicking.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            37-22\n                        \n                                6\n                            \n                                    Timberwolves\n                                \n                            Minnesota held off Portland on Tuesday and has now won four of its last five. Jaden McDaniels is balling, averaging better tan 16 points on 55/48/81 shooting splits in February with premium perimeter defense. The Wolves are three up on the seventh-seeded Suns, who just lost Dillon Brooks to a broken hand. A top-six seed feels pretty likely at this point, and top-four is there for the taking. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            36-23\n                        \n                                7\n                            \n                                    Rockets\n                                \n                            The Rockets blew a 16-point fourth-quarter lead to lose the Knicks on Saturday. The point guard hole has become more and more glaring as the season has gone on. It too often feels like the stagnant offenses we've seen from Kevin Durant teams in the past where he's relied on to make too many tough shots over the long haul. All the ratings look like a contender, but I'm losing trust in this team at that level. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            35-21\n                        \n                                8\n                            \n                                    Nuggets\n                                \n                            The Nuggets put 157 on the Blazers on Friday after coming out of the All-Star break with a one-point loss to the Clippers. They have lost six of 10 since Nikola Jokić returned for the final game of January, and have lost their last seven games against plus-.500 teams. Aaron Gordon's absence is huge. They can't truly contend without him.\n                        \n                            5\n                        \n                            36-22\n                        \n                                9\n                            \n                                    Knicks\n                                \n                            The good news is Karl-Anthony Towns has found his stroke for the moment. He's shooting 63% over four games since the All-Star break and has made nine of his last 13 3s. The bad news is he only took five shots in the loss to Cleveland on Tuesday, when you would've been forgiven for forgetting he was even on the floor at times. Had the Knicks not rallied from 16 down in the fourth to beat the Rockets they would be 1-3 post-All-Star, but they have also won 12 of their last 16. Tough to call this team a contender, but tough to fully dismiss them, too. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            37-22\n                        \n                                10\n                            \n                                    Lakers\n                                \n                            Luka Dončić had a look at a game-tying 3 in the waning seconds vs. Orlando Tuesday night, but it was a bit too deep for his taste, By the time he hesitated and stepped in the shot was no longer available and LeBron had to hoist up a prayer that never had a chance.

    "body": "\n        Wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba put the Seattle Seahawks on notice with his contract demands during an interview with WFAA in his hometown of Dallas. \"I'm not really too pressed right now to get it done. I know my time is coming, and when we get it done, it's going to be a great deal,\" said Smith-Njigba. … I believe I deserve to be the highest paid in my position, just what I give to the game and the community, I give it my all. And I think that's worth a lot, lot more.\"The Seahawks plan to extend the contracts of Smith-Njigba and cornerback Devon Witherspoon, both 2023 first-round picks, this offseason. The fifth-year options for 2027 will surely be picked up with both players by the May 1 deadline if necessary. Smith-Njigba's fifth-year option projects to 7.919% of the 2026 salary cap. This figure should be between $23.852 million and $24.208 million with the NFL recently informing teams that the 2026 salary cap is expected to be between $301.2 million and $305.7 million.Ja'Marr Chase is currently the NFL highest-paid wide receiver. He signed a four-year, $161 million contract extension, averaging $40.25 million per year, with the Cincinnati Bengals last March. The deal has $109.8 million in guarantees where $73.9 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The maximum value of Chase's extension is $162 million thanks to a $250,000 annual incentive in the new contract years (2026-2029) for each Super Bowl win with 65% or more offensive playtime in the game as well as 65% or more offensive playtime during the same regular season.\nSmith-Njigba may not be setting his sights high enough financially in wanting to top the wide receiver pay scale. The last two times the wide receiver market was reset, Chase and Justin Jefferson also became the league's highest-paid non-quarterback. The Minnesota Vikings signed Jefferson to a four-year, $140 million extension, averaging $35 million per year, in 2024. His contract has $110 million in guarantees, of which $88.743 million was fully guaranteed at signing. Both amounts are records for a wide receiver.Micah Parsons leads non-quarterbacks with the four-year, $186 million extension, averaging $46.5 million per year, that was a part of his trade from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers at the end of August. There are $136.007 million of guarantees with a non-quarterback record $120 million fully guaranteed at signing.Detroit Lions edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson is No. 2 among non-quarterbacks. He signed a four-year, $180 million extension, averaging $45 million, with a non-quarterback-record $141 million of overall guarantees in October.\nA common denominator exists with Chase, Jefferson and Smith-Njigba. Each was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year while playing on their rookie contracts. Jefferson won the award in 2022 as a third-year NFL player when he had 128 receptions, 1,809 receiving yards and eight receiving touchdowns. His catches and receiving yards were the seventh- and sixth-best single-season totals in league history at the time. Chase won the receiving triple crown by simultaneously leading the league in receptions (127), receiving yards (1,708) and receiving touchdowns (17) in 2024 when he received the honor. He was in his fourth NFL season.\nSmith-Njigba's 2025 performance compares favorably with Chase's and Jefferson's award-winning seasons. He had a true breakout season after leading the Seahawks with 100 receptions, 1,130 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns in 2024. Smith-Njigba earned 2025 NFL Offensive Player of the Year honors by catching 119 passes for a league-leading 1,793 receiving yards with 10 touchdowns. He carried Seattle's passing attack. Smith-Njigba's 36.6% of the team's receptions and 44.1% of the team's receiving yards are the third and fourth marks all time in these respective categories, according to TruMedia.\nChase and Jefferson were more accomplished than Smith-Njigba before receiving market-setting extensions. Both played a fourth NFL season prior to signing big deals. Nobody has ever had a more productive start to an NFL career at wide receiver than Jefferson whether looking at his first three seasons or his first four seasons. Chase was named 2021's NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and earned Pro Bowl honors in each of his first four seasons.Chase and Jefferson became the league's highest-paid non-quarterback by small amounts. Jefferson topped San Francisco 49ers edge rusher Nick Bosa's $34 million-per-year, five-year extension by 2.94%. It was a 0.63% increase for Chase over Cleveland Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett's four-year extension, averaging $40 million per year. Getting a similar type of increase as these two would put Smith-Njigba between $46.75 million and $47.75 million per year.It should be noted that Chase's deal is backloaded. Chase has $44.816 million in 2029, the final year of his extension. The average after the first three new years is $38.728 million per year. Jefferson's contract isn't structured like this. His average after the first three new years ($35,333,333) is slightly more than the deal's average ($35 million).\nIn terms of just setting the wide receiver pay scale, Jefferson moved the market by 9.38%. Smith-Njigba would be at just over $44 million per year with Jefferson's increase. Chase's $40.25 million per year is 15% more than Jefferson's $35 million per year. A Chase-type increase would mean $46,287,500 per year, which would be right below Parsons. Smith-Njigba may want to consider abandoning his quest to become the NFL's highest-paid wide receiver provided he gets an extremely player-friendly structure on a shorter term than Chase and Jefferson. A three-year extension with two years remaining on a rookie contract isn't out of the ordinary with wide receivers taken in the first round. Devonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle, 2021 first round picks, signed respective three-year, $75 million and $84.75 million extensions with the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins in 2024.The Seahawks also have a history of signing No. 1 wide receivers on rookie deals to three-year extensions. DK Metcalf received a three-year, $72 million extension, averaging $24 million per year, in 2022. His $30 million signing bonus was a record for wide receivers. \nCeeDee Lamb is the current wide receiver record holder with the $38 million signing bonus in the four-year, $136 million extension he signed with the Dallas Cowboys in 2024. At $34 million per year, Lamb tied Bosa as the league's second-highest-paid non-quarterback behind Jefferson.Smith-Njigba could insist that the Seahawks follow the structural precedent set with Metcalf. Metcalf's deal was tremendously front-loaded. He had 37.19%, 56.94% and 75% of his new money, respectively, through his contract year, first new contract year and his second new contract year. In a neutral deal which isn't front-loaded or back-loaded, there would be 33.33% and 66.67% of the new money, respectively, after the first and second new contract years.Given how back-loaded Chase's contract is, Smith-Njigba's salary benchmark would be his $38.728 million average after his third new contract year. Signing for $39 million per year would make Smith-Njigba the league's second-highest-paid wide receiver behind Chase's $40.25 million per year. He would rank sixth among non-quarterbacks.\nThe Seahawks don't fully guarantee at signing money in the second year of high-end contracts like most other NFL teams do. This practice had been in place for at least a couple of years when quarterback Russell Wilson signed his first contract extension with the Seahawks in 2015. There is an early guarantee vesting date in the second year. An injury guarantee becomes fully guaranteed on the fifth day of the waiver period, which is five days after the Super Bowl, rather than the third or fifth day of the league year like with most teams. A third-year or fourth-year guarantee doesn't vest a year early (i.e., 2028 injury guarantee is fully guaranteed in 2027) with Seahawks contracts either. It's also the fifth day of the waiver period in that particular year for the conversion to fully guaranteed.\nThese structural conventions with guarantees would seemingly make front-loading Smith-Njigba's contract a necessity. Smith-Njigba would probably require a record-breaking signing bonus given Metcalf got one. A $40 million signing bonus wouldn't be out of the question. In a $39 million-per-year extension, Smith-Njigba would have $87.75 million of new money after the first two new contract years by getting Metcalf's cash-flow percentages. He would be in a position for a new deal in 2030 when he is 28 after averaging $43.875 million per year over his first two extension or new years.Smith-Njigba's comments to WFAA suggest he is willing to be patient for a new deal. The Rams have more urgency with wide receiver Puka Nacua since there isn't a fifth-year option with the 2023 fifth-round pick. Nacua, who is entering his contract year, finished third in the Offensive Player of the Year voting. He led the NFL with 129 receptions for 1,715 yards and 10 touchdowns last season. \nSmith-Njigba's best deal in 2026 could come from letting Nacua go first. That's only if he is confident in his fellow 2025 first-team All-Pro member getting a strong deal. Smith-Njigba having another All-Pro-caliber season in 2026 while continuing to play under his rookie contract would give him more ammunition to follow in Chase's and Jefferson's footsteps by topping non-quarterbacks in pay.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Cincinnati Bengals are in decision-making mode with edge rusher Trey Hendrickson, who will enter free agency if he's not franchise tagged before the upcoming March 3 deadline. Tagging Hendrickson gives the Bengals a chance at landing a return, potentially in the form of a draft pick or two via trade, or trying to sign the All-Pro end to an extension before the start of the 2026 season.The clock is ticking from the NFL combine for a franchise that already experienced last summer's holdout headache with Hendrickson coming off of his career-year in 2024 after posting 17.5 sacks. Hendrickson played in only seven games last fall due to injury, as his production diminished.\"All trades are difficult,\" Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin said this week from Indianapolis. \"You got to find a partner and you have to find somebody that you have to have some cooperation with your players that you're talking about this with. Trades can be complicated and that hypothetical scenario would be very complicated.\"Tobin said the Bengals have resources to \"attack the offseason\" and acknowledged all options are on the table with Hendrickson. If he's tagged and is not traded, Cincinnati would owe Hendrickson around $30 million next season, then could tag him again next spring for an enhanced cost if an extension is not signed.\nTobin has no interest in showing the Bengals' hand with their pending decision from the combine.\"He didn't have the year he wanted this year. We didn't have the year we wanted this year,\" Tobin said. \"Those are factors and we'll see where we go from there. But in terms of how we're gonna deploy the tag, if we are going to, that's not something I'm gonna talk about here.\"If Hendrickson is not tagged and becomes a free agent, that would provide the Bengals with considerable cap space to go add defensive help. The Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers are two teams projected to be potential landing spots if Cincinnati chooses to go that route.\n\"There's a connection with the Colts and their defensive coordinator, Lou Anarumo, who was the defensive coordinator when he was with the Cincinnati Bengals. History there with the coaching staff ... so that would make sense,\" CBS Sports' Tyler Sullivan said this month on CBS Sports HQ. \"You look at the 49ers, they had the fewest sacks in the NFL last season. Obviously, lot of that due to injury, but you continue to add (pieces) to attack the quarterback when you're in a division with Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold. So to me, Trey Hendrickson in San Fran would make sense as well.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The lower-body injury that Canadian hockey star Sidney Crosby sustained in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics will have a significant impact on the NHL season. The Pittsburgh Penguins on Wednesday placed Crosby on injured reserve and announced that the center will miss a minimum of four weeks as a result.Crosby sustained the injury in the semifinals of the Olympic tournament. An awkward sequence along the boards in Canada's win over Czechia led to his departure from the contest, and he was unavailable for the gold medal game against the United States.Crosby took a hit from Radko Gudas and Martin Necas in the semifinal round that appeared to hurt him and required assistance from the Team Canada medical staff. After examination on the bench, Crosby departed for the locker room and carried a noticeable limp as he walked into the tunnel.A prolonged absence upon the resumption of the NHL season will force Crosby to watch the Penguins' playoff push from the bench. Pittsburgh will return to action Thursday against the New Jersey Devils at 29-15-12 on the year and in second place in the Metro Division. With the Penguins set to spend at least the next month without their leading scorer, they could fall out of the Stanley Cup picture entirely.\nYear 21 in the NHL has been yet another outstanding one for the future first-ballot Hall of Famer. He netted 27 goals and racked up 32 assists before the Olympic break, putting him on pace to potentially score at least 90 points for the fourth consecutive season. He has been far and away the most productive player on the ice for the Penguins at age 38.Not only could Crosby's absence have devastating ramifications for the Penguins over the final weeks of the season, but it also did nothing to help Canada in the final stage of Olympic competition. While his injury may have been a rallying moment for the Canadians in their comeback win over Czechia in the semifinals, they could have used his presence in the loss to Team USA.Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist in 2014, said that Canada \"deserved better\" than its 2-1 overtime loss to the Americans. He also said it was his decision alone to sit out of the gold medal game.\n\"I was pretty close,\" Crosby said. \"I mean, ultimately I wasn't able to go out there and do what I needed to do in order to help the team, so at that point, you've got to make a decision that's best for the group. Not an easy one. But, you know, that's hockey.\"\n            \n",

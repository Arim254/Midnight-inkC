    "body": "\n        Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy's simulator golf league, TGL, announced enhancements to its gameplay as its second season quickly approaches in December. Modifications touch just about every aspect of the experience as the digital holes on the screen and the physical putting surface housed in the SoFi Center are among the biggest changes made.While the actual hole designs will remain the same, the visual quality has improved drastically. Not only that, but each of the six teams will select one hole that was featured in the first season and designate it as its own team hole, giving it a localized backdrop and terrain. Certain teams consistently pressed its advantage on certain holes throughout the first season and with the introduction of the team hole, this edge could prove to be even greater.This was the biggest change made to the digital portion of the competition while the rest were made with the physical golf in mind. \n                                                                    TGL\n                                                            The Green Zone -- the short-game area and putting surface -- has received a bit of a facelift. The putting area has increased by nearly 40% which will allow the league to utilize 12 different hole locations throughout matches. This total is up from seven in the first season. The larger green also makes it so the adjustable putting surface is larger as well, which will give players more to think about.\nInitially, three greenside bunkers were in play for competitors to contend with, but that total has been cut down to two. The smallest bunker was removed, but in doing so, TGL decided to increase the size of the other two. They will feature revetted layers of turf to give it a distinct look. A common issue in the first season of play was golf balls destined for the sand via the simulator not quite settling in the bunker, giving players awkward stances. Time will tell if this is a remedy for that.Other modifications put the in-house fans first as the highest point in the Green Zone has been lowered ever so slightly. This will give fans a better view and in return give players more options around the green to hit a variety of shots. The hitting zones -- tee boxes, approach boxes and fairway bunker boxes -- have been enlarged, too. Two towers have been removed as ball-tracking sensors have been relocated to the ceiling.\n                                                                    TGL\n                                                            After an inaugural season that featured 15 regular season matches and a postseason, TGL sought the feedback of its players as well as the data and analytics it collected from all of the matches. The modifications appear to be a positive, especially knowing the league is willing to accept and implement where it believes it may have fallen short -- similar to changing the hammer rule mid-season.\nUltimately, no matter the changes to gameplay, TGL's success is predicated on two other elements that it cannot control given deals already made -- the players' commitment and energy in playing these matches during the initial portion of the PGA Tour calendar and the simulator technology that experienced its fair share of bugs in the first season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Death Star in Kansas City is fully operational once again.The Chiefs are riding high after throttling the Raiders, 31-0, in the return of wide receiver Rashee Rice from a six-game suspension. It seems like the inefficiencies of the Chiefs' offense from weeks 1-3 are in the past, and this Kansas City offense could be the most explosive and dynamic quarterback Patrick Mahomes has had since the Tyreek Hill trade. A large part of that is Rice, who came back and immediately got to work. Rice had 10 targets on 16 routes run and scored two touchdowns. However, I think what he did on those routes is what's important, and it makes the Chiefs' offense even more dangerous than before.Rashee Rice is one of the most dynamic slot receivers in the NFL, being strong enough to make tough catches over the middle but also torches linebackers and safeties in the short to intermediate areas of the field. The last time Rice played a full season (2023), Rice was sixth in the NFL in yards after the catch according to NFL Pro, and from the slot he averaged 2.5 Yards per route run and a 0.53 EPA per target. Pretty darn good if you ask me!\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 8 NFL picks: Cowboys beat Broncos in shootout, Packers spoil Aaron Rodgers' revenge game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith Rice back in the fold against the Raiders, the Chiefs really began to unleash the YAC machine and with it gave their offense another dangerous element. Before Rice came back, running back Brashard Smith was their guy on screen routes, leading the Chiefs in targets on WR screens. Furthermore, when the Chiefs ran their RPOs pre-Rice, the leading target getter was Hollywood Brown and Smith again. There are much better ways to use Brown and Smith is more of a specialist in his role, so adding Rice into these areas make the offense much more dangerous. Their RPOs are an extension of their run game, efficient ways of stealing yards and forcing the defense to play the numbers game. Rice is similar to a running back after the catch, and it was on display against Vegas. Kansas City is in 13 personnel (three tight ends) with Rice as the lone receiver, and they send him in motion to the side with TEs Travis Kelce and Noah Gray. The Raiders don't adjust to the motion and only have three guys to defend three eligible receivers. Mahomes throws this to Rice with 2 TEs in front of him and it's basically free yardage. With Rice back, the Chiefs have a guy who is really strong after the catch making the quick swing passes on RPOs even more of a problem than before. \nOn top of that, Rice is also the strongest against man coverage and design him targets to maximize his strengths against NFL defenses. Rice is such a strong player in the slot and growing against press coverage that he helps to blend everyone else's skills on the Chiefs offense. As good and fun as Xavier Worthy is, he's not that great against press coverage right now. He only averages 1.3 yards per route run against press right now, and Travis Kelce is more fit to just find gaps in zone than be a constant separator. Rice brings juice against man coverage and Kansas City gives him a lot of opportunities to go and win, especially against linebackers. According to NFL Pro, Rice matched up against Las Vegas LBs Devin White and Elandon Roberts and caught three passes for 29 yards and had a jet sweep TD. KC designs him choice routes and juke routes against linebackers, using his explosiveness and quickness out of breaks to hammer linebackers in the slot. When the Chiefs give him looks like this, they're going to be very hard to stop.\nWhere the rubber really hits the road with Rice and the Chiefs is that they can be more versatile with their skill position group. Kansas City started to use 12 and 13 personnel a little bit more against the Raiders, but with Rice on the field they can use him as a power slot, lining him up in condensed formations and using him as a blocker as well. With all of the weapons that Kansas City has in their arsenal, Rice is the perfect player to blend all of it together. Because of how strong he is after the catch and how good he can be against press coverage, Rice is the perfect guy to mesh everything that the Chiefs offense wants to be, turning them into the fire breathing dragon of an offense we know they can be. \nRice's return had some really nice positives, and although there's a lot of season left, by being on the field he gives the Chiefs another problem to throw at defenses.\n            ",

When asked about Sanders' lack of work with the first team, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said it has nothing to do with Sanders and everything to do with who is ahead of him on the depth chart. \"With a young quarterback with Dillon starting, you wanna make sure you get a lot of reps,\" Stefanski said. \"Different than you have a veteran like Joe.\" Like Sanders, Dillon Gabriel is also a rookie navigating through his first NFL regular season. Since replacing Joe Flacco as the Browns' starting quarterback, Gabriel is 1-2 with three touchdowns passing touchdowns against no picks. And while his 59.8% completion rate isn't great, it's actually better than Flacco's 58.1% during his four starts prior the Bengals trade.\nWhile Gabriel continues to grow as the Browns' QB1, Sanders continues to wait for his opportunity, whether that's during game days or during the practice week. Stefanski stressed that Sanders still receives plenty of chances to work on his craft during practice, even though it's not with the first-team offense. \n\"Still getting reps in a bunch of periods,\" he said. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A number of survivor pool players have seen their hopes disappear, but for those few still alive, Week 8 of the NFL schedule leaves them with several solid options. Week 7 didn't feature as much carnage as previous weeks, as most of the favorites earned wins, including the Kansas City Chiefs with a 31-0 win over Las Vegas, and the New England Patriots with a 31-13 win over Tennessee. A slight hinderance to players is the fact that six teams will be on their bye in Week 8. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Dolphins at Falcons (-7.5), Bears at Ravens (-6.5), Bills at Panthers (+7.5), Jets at Bengals (-6.5) and Browns at Patriots (-7).Meanwhile, the Indianapolis Colts look to cruise to the AFC South title. Indianapolis (6-1) has a two-game lead over second-place Jacksonville within the division. Indianapolis will look for the season sweep of Tennessee. The Colts rolled to a 41-20 win over the Titans in Week 3. Indianapolis enters as a 14-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Colts are among the many appealing options for those who can still use them. Before finalizing any Week 8 NFL survivor picks, see which team the red-hot SportsLine Projection Model just went all-in on.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

However, Chicago has defeated Baltimore in two of the last three matchups overall and four of seven in the all-time series.The Bears have been on a roll with four consecutive wins. Caleb Williams has completed 61.1% of his passes with 1,351 yards and nine touchdowns with three interceptions and a 92.9 rating, to lead the Chicago offense. Baltimore, meanwhile, still is uncertain of the status of starting quarterback Lamar Jackson, who has missed each of the last two weeks with a hamstring injury. Overall, the Ravens have lost four in a row.

The former Oregon standout has quickly established himself as one of the premier young signal-callers in the NFL. In the 2024 season, he threw for 3,870 yards, completing 65.9% of his passes, tossed 23 touchdowns and only three interceptions, finishing with a 101.7 passer rating. Through the early portion of the 2025 campaign, he has already totaled 1,913 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, and six interceptions in seven games while leading the league in passing yards. Despite his impressive production, Herbert has been selected to the Pro Bowl just once, back in 2021, which many consider an underrepresentation of his talent. His combination of arm strength, pocket awareness, and mobility has made him the centerpiece of the Chargers' offense under coach Jim Harbaugh, and he continues to trend toward the elite tier of NFL quarterbacks. See who else to roster right here.\nPart of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson. The former LSU standout has rapidly ascended into the elite tier of NFL wide receivers, already earning four Pro Bowl selections by the 2024 season. In 2024, he caught 103 passes for 1,533 yards and 10 touchdowns, continuing his streak of five consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. In the 2025 campaign he's maintained that high standard, posting 34 receptions for 528 yards and one touchdown in limited play so far, with an impressive 15.5 yards per catch. Throughout his career, Jefferson has been a consistent target and game-changer, known for his ability to stretch the field and deliver in big moments. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:\nHow to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Chargers vs. VikingsKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thursday.

In lieu, the Sony Open at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu will serve as the league's first tournament of the 2026 season from Jan. 15-18.\"Since it first became a possibility that the PGA Tour would not be able to play at The Plantation Course at Kapalua due to the ongoing drought conditions on Maui, we worked closely with our partners at Sentry to assess options for contesting The Sentry in 2026,\" PGA Tour chief competitions officer Tyler Dennis said in a statement. \"While it is unfortunate to arrive at this decision, we are appreciative of the collaboration and dedication from Sentry Insurance, a tremendous partner of ours.\"The Tour announced in September that the tournament was not going to be held at the Plantation Course and looked at other options to hold the tournament. Those options included other venues in the Aloha State and elsewhere, but it was ultimately deemed not plausible given the infrastructure and vendor support needed to put on a tournament.The Sentry was the Tour's season opening event from 1986 to 2013 and since 2024 when the circuit returned to a calendar-year schedule.\nThose qualified for The Sentry include the top 50 in the 2025 FedEx Cup standings as well as winners from the previous season. The players who finished inside top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings qualified for all the signature events in 2026, while the winners who planned to play in The Sentry — and were only in the field via that win — will now be added to the field at another signature event in the RBC Heritage.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco Giants have a new manager and the team's president of baseball operations, Buster Posey, is going with an unconventional hire. They have reached a deal to hire University of Tennessee head coach Tony Vitello to be their manager. The Giants announced the deal as official Wednesday afternoon.\"We're thrilled to welcome Tony to the Giants family,\" Posey said in a statement. \"Tony is one of the brightest, most innovative, and most respected coaches in college baseball today. Throughout our search, Tony's leadership, competitiveness, and commitment to developing players stood out. His ability to build strong, cohesive teams and his passion for the game align perfectly with the values of our organization. We look forward to the energy and direction he will bring, along with the memories to be made, and we focus on the future of Giants baseball.\" Vitello becomes the first college coach ever to jump directly to an MLB managerial job.\"I'm incredibly honored and grateful for this opportunity,\" Vitello said. \"I'm excited to lead this group of players and represent the San Francisco Giants. I can't wait to get started and work to establish a culture that makes Giants faithful proud. I would like to thank Greg Johnson, Larry Baer, and Zack Minasian for this responsibility and the opportunity to lead this iconic franchise both on and off the field.\"  \nVitello, 47, has never played or coached in the professional ranks. He was an assistant coach at Missouri (2003-10), TCU (2011-13), and Arkansas (2014-17) before landing the head Tennessee job in 2018. Vitello has transformed the program, guiding the Volunteers to their first NCAA postseason appearance since 2005 in his second season as head coach.\n        \n            \n                MLB job openings: Here are three college coaches ex-GM Jim Bowden says could make the jump to the big leagues\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn 2022, the Volunteers had one of the greatest seasons in college baseball history, going 57-9 with a plus-421 run differential. Vitello led Tennessee to the College World Series in 2021, 2023, and 2024. The program won its first National Championship in 2024. In eight years as head coach, Vitello's record is 341-131 (.722).The Giants have several former Tennessee players in their organization, including outfielder Drew Gilbert and righty Blade Tidwell, who came over in the Tyler Rogers trade with the New York Mets. San Francisco's first-round pick last year, infielder Gavin Kilen, also played at Tennessee. Gilbert, Kilen, and Tidwell all played for Vitello.\nIt is almost unprecedented for a college coach to jump straight into an MLB coaching role, never mind the manager position. Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy was a longtime college head coach before making the leap into the big leagues, though he spent several years as a bench coach before getting his first MLB manager job.Vitello joins a team with the talent to win right away. The Giants have a bona fide ace in Logan Webb and a strong middle of the lineup anchored by Willy Adames, Matt Chapman, Rafael Devers, and Jung Hoo Lee. Top prospect Bryce Eldridge figures to assume a larger role in 2026 as well.The Giants went 81-81 and missed the postseason for the fourth straight year and the eighth time in the last nine years. Manager Bob Melvin was let go after the season.\n            ",

Dillingham did not provide a timeline for when Tyson could return to the lineup for the No. 24-ranked Sun Devils.\"I'm not ready to comment on that right now,\" Dillingham said. \"This is something (where) I'm trying to protect him from himself. That dude is a competitor out there. Playing at the end of last game, making plays. So this is something where we are making a decision to protect him from him a little bit cause he's such a competitor.\"Tyson, a projected first-round pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, is off to a terrific start to the 2025 season. In seven games, Tyson caught 57 passes for 628 yards and eight touchdowns. In that win over Texas Tech -- where he played through the hamstring injury throughout the second half -- Tyson finished with 10 catches for 105 yards and a touchdown.\n\n        \n            \n                Big 12 championship race -- chaotic as ever -- resets as Arizona State upset of Texas Tech adds teams to mix\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter spending the 2022 season at Colorado, Tyson broke out during last year's Arizona State's run to the College Football Playoff. Tyson finished with 75 catches for 1,101 yards and 10 touchdowns, but was ruled out for the postseason due to a collarbone injury suffered against Arizona in Arizona State's penultimate game of the regular season.Arizona State's offense relied heavily on Tyson this season. The Sun Devils don't have another wide receiver on the roster with more than eight receptions. ASU's top pass catchers -- outside of Tyson -- are running back Raleek Brown (25 catches for 139 yards), tight end Chamon Metayer (21 catches for 226 yards and running back Kyson Brown (eight catches for 72 yards). Derek Eusebio, who is second among all wide receivers on the roster in catches (eight), caught two passes for six yards last week against the Red Raiders.\nThe Sun Devils (5-2, 3-1 Big 12) head into the second half of the season still in contention for a berth in the Big 12 title game. Arizona State doesn't play a ranked opponent the remainder of the season, and the biggest tests will come this weekend against Houston and on Nov. 1 against Iowa State on the road.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A cross-conference battle kicks off NFL Week 8 as the Los Angeles Chargers host the Minnesota Vikings on 'Thursday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. NFL player props figure to center on the passing games, with both teams dealing with injuries to their running backs, and there's no shortage of quality receivers to use in 'Thursday Night Football' props. Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston all had at least 67 yards or a touchdown on Sunday. Justin Herbert, who leads the league with 1,913 passing yards has a passing touchdown prop bar of 1.5, which is the same as Carson Wentz, who continues to start in place of J.J. McCarthy (ankle)The NFL prop odds, however, differ for the quarterbacks in regard to passing touchdowns. Herbert is at -172 to hit the Over, while Wentz having multiple touchdown passes would return a payout of +102. Your NFL prop bet strategy should take into account multiple factors, including recent performances, the opposing defense and even weather conditions.

Through four starts, Wentz is averaging 268 passing yards, which is fourth-most in the NFL. He has a pair of 300-plus passing yard games over his last three starts as Minnesota is leaning on him rather than a run game without Aaron Jones. Wentz has averaged 40.7 pass attempts over the last three games, and for comparison, Herbert, who leads the NFL in pass attempts in 2025, is averaging 38.7 attempts on the season.Los Angeles just allowed a season-high in passing yards on Sunday, giving up 288 to Daniel Jones. The Chargers' defense gets a little lax at home, as it's given up 70.3 more passing yards at SoFi Stadium than in road games, and that doesn't even take into account the Chargers allowing 249 passing yards in the Brazil contest. The AI model projects Wentz to have 250.7 passing yards, giving this NFL prop bet a 4-star rating. See more NFL props here.New users can also target the FanDuel promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins:How to make NFL player prop bets for Vikings vs. ChargersIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model   says another star sails past his total and has four additional NFL props that are rated four stars or better.

    "body": "\nOne day after the 2025-26 NBA season kicked off with a pair of contests, Wednesday's schedule is loaded with a dozen games, including a matchup between two of last season's top teams in the Eastern Conference at Madison Square Garden as the New York Knicks host the Cleveland Cavaliers.Cleveland finished atop the East in 2024-25 with a 64-18 record but lost to the Indiana Pacers in the conference semifinals in five games. The Knicks, who went 51-31 last campaign to finish third in the conference and were defeated by the Pacers in the conference finals, are beginning the Mike Brown era. A two-time NBA Coach of the Year who had two stints with the Cavaliers, Brown was hired in July to replace Tom Thibodeau, who was relieved of his head-coaching duties a month earlier.Three games are on Wednesday's NHL schedule, one of which has the Detroit Red Wings visiting KeyBank Center to face the Buffalo Sabres. Detroit (5-1-0), which occupies first place in the Atlantic Division, is coming off a 4-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Sunday that completed a 3-0-0 homestand and extended the team's winning streak to five games. The Sabres (2-4-0) were denied a third consecutive victory Monday as they dropped a 4-2 decision to the Montreal Canadiens on the road.Meanwhile, Week 9 of the 2025 college football season continues with a pair of Conference USA matchups, including a showdown between Missouri State (3-3, 1-1) and New Mexico State (3-3, 1-2) at Aggie Memorial Stadium in Las Cruces on the CBS Sports Network.Cleveland is a 3.5-point favorite in the latest NBA betting odds for Cavaliers vs. Knicks. The Red Wings are -113 favorites versus the Sabres, and Missouri State is favored by 1.5 points in its contest against New Mexico State.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on for Wednesday, Oct. 22. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchCavaliers at KnicksTime: 7 p.m. | Location: New York | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Cavaliers -3.5 (-111)The Knicks had one of the best home records among Eastern Conference teams last season at 27-14 but were a disappointing 4-5 on their own court in the playoffs. Meanwhile, only the Boston Celtics (33-8) and Oklahoma City Thunder (32-8) had better road marks than Cleveland (30-11) in the entire league. The Cavaliers dominated New York in 2024-25, winning all four meetings by an average of 17 points. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Cavs picking up where they left off, as they cover the spread in 53% of its simulations.Spurs at MavericksTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Dallas | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Mavericks -2.5 (-115) | Expert: Mavericks -148 (Tim Doyle)Both teams finished under .500 last season, but the Mavericks performed fairly well at home, going 22-18 at American Airlines Center. Two of those victories came against the Spurs, whom they also defeated in the first of their two meetings at San Antonio before dropping a 126-116 decision there in their final matchup of the campaign. The Spurs will be without De'Aaron Fox, who is battling a hamstring injury, while Dallas' Kyrie Irving still is recovering from a torn ACL and may not return until the calendar flips to 2026. Regardless, the SportsLine Projection Model likes the Mavericks to win outright, which it lists as an A-rated pick, and its simulations have them covering the spread 67% of the time. SportsLine expert Tim Doyle also believes Dallas will chalk up a victory as he feels Fox's absence will be too much for San Antonio to overcome.More NBA best betsModel's top player props for Wednesday\nNHL best bets, where to watchRed Wings at SabresTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Buffalo | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Sabres -107Since losing their season opener against Montreal, the Red Wings have reeled off five consecutive victories and have allowed fewer than three goals in each of the last four. Captain Dylan Larkin has begun 2025-26 with a six-game point streak, collecting five goals and six assists during the run. The Sabres followed a season-opening three-game losing streak with back-to-back wins before falling to the Canadiens last time out. Detroit won three of the four meetings between the clubs last campaign, including a 6-5 triumph in a shootout at Buffalo. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Sabres ending the Red Wings' winning streak, as they win in 60% of its simulations.CFB best bets, where to watchMissouri State at New Mexico StateTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Las Cruces, N.M. | TV: CBS Sports Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: New Mexico State +1.5 (-117)Missouri State has alternated wins and losses over its first six games this season, its first in Conference USA. The Bears, who were members of the Missouri Valley Conference from 1985-2024, are coming off a 22-20 triumph over Middle Tennessee in which there were five lead changes. New Mexico State began the year with a pair of victories but has lost three of its last four contests, including a 30-27 setback at Liberty last time out. The Aggies overcame a 14-point halftime deficit to go ahead by seven in the fourth quarter before allowing the decisive touchdown with 36 seconds remaining. New Mexico State is looking to win its first four home games in a season for the first time since 2002, and the SportsLine Projection Model believes it will happen. It has the Aggies covering the spread in 70% of its simulations and says they win outright 68% of the time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a two-game appetizer of Opening Night, the NBA will serve up a main course of action on Wednesday. A dozen games means the NBA DFS player pool is brimming with top options for daily Fantasy basketball lineups. From stars like Jalen Brunson, Anthony Edwards, Joel Embiid and Ja Morant to the No. 1 overall pick in Cooper Flagg, you certainly have the ability to diversify your NBA DFS picks. Finding someone who can outperform his price tags on sites like FanDuel and DraftKings is key to that and to constructing a winning NBA DFS strategy.Jayson Tatum's absence in Boston will all but force other Celtics to step up. Jaylen Brown (questionable, hamstring) will have the offense run through him if he suits up, but the likes of Baylor Scheierman, Josh Minott and Chris Boucher will have no shortage of opportunities to establish themselves. An NBA DFS stack of inexpensive Celtics could return dividends against Philadelphia on Wednesday. Before making any NBA DFS picks, be sure to check out the NBA DFS advice, player rankings, stacks, and top daily Fantasy basketball picks from SportsLine's Mike McClure.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:McClure is a DFS professional with more than $2 million in career winnings. He's also a predictive data engineer at SportsLine who uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every minute of every game 10,000 times, taking factors like matchups, statistical trends and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best NBA DFS values on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel and create optimal lineups that he shares only over at SportsLine. They're a must-see for any NBA DFS player.On Tuesday, McClure identified Lakers guard Luka Doncic as one of his top NBA DFS picks on both sites. The result: Doncic had 43 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists, two steals and a block, returning 78.5 points on DraftKings and 76.9 points on FanDuel. Anybody who included him in their lineups could have been well on the way to a profitable day.McClure has turned his attention to NBA action on Wednesday and locked in his top daily Fantasy basketball picks. You can only see them by heading to SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, which may include a play $5, get $100 offer:Top NBA DFS picks for Wednesday, October 22For Wednesday, one of McClure's top NBA DFS picks is Mavericks PF/C Anthony Davis, who is listed at $9,700 on DraftKings and $10,900 on FanDuel. After playing just nine games for Dallas last season after the shocking Doncic trade with the Lakers, Davis is ready to make more of an impact with the Mavs, especially early on with Kyrie Irving (knee) sidelined. The 10-time All-Star put up 24.7 points between his two teams a year ago with 11.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.2 blocks.Dallas will host the Spurs on Wednesday, and while many big men would rather not face Victor Wembanyama, Davis clearly enjoys the challenge. Over five matchups versus Wemby, Davis has dominated, with averages of 30.8 points on 61.1% shooting, with 12.4 rebounds. Additionally, the Spurs allowed the fifth-most NBA DFS points to opposing power forwards last season on both DraftKings and on FanDuel.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Another part of McClure's optimal NBA DFS strategy includes rostering Raptors small forward Brandon Ingram ($7,400 on both DraftKings and on FanDuel). Ingram will make his team debut after being traded to Toronto last year but missing the rest of the year due to injury. His season high of 33 points last year came in the season opener as he averaged 22.2 points, 5.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists on the year for New Orleans. Just 10 other players averaged at least 22-5-5 on the season.It's certainly clear that Ingram gets up for season openers, as over his last six games to tip off his seasons, he's averaged 25.1 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists. All of those stats are well above his career averages as the Raptors will visit Atlanta on Wednesday. It just so happens that Ingram's second-highest point total last year, after 33 points in the season opener, came when he dropped 32 points on the Hawks to go along with grabbing seven boards. See McClure's other NBA DFS picks right here.How to set your NBA DFS lineups for Wednesday, October 22McClure is also targeting a player who could go off for massive numbers on Wednesday because of a dream matchup. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is here.Who is DFS pro Mike McClure putting in his optimal NBA DFS lineups for Wednesday? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NBA DFS picks, rankings, advice, and stacks, all from a professional DFS player who has over $2 million in career winnings, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule features just one game on Christmas Eve, and it takes place in the Aloha State. The Sheraton Hawaii Bowl 2025 will see the California Golden Bears facing the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors. Cal (7-5) is coming off a 38-35 win over SMU but has lost three straight bowl games. Hawaii (8-4) enters in off a 27-7 victory over Wyoming and is 5-4 all-time in its namesake bowl. The Golden Bears enter the 2025 Hawaii Bowl leading the all-time series between the programs, 2-1. Star Hawaii receiver Jackson Harris, who had nearly 1,000 yards receiving this year, is in the transfer portal.

His rights were traded to the New York Knicks in 2024. However, Nnaji never signed an NBA contract, and instead has been playing in Europe, most recently with Yukatel Merkezefendi in Turkey on loan from Spain's FC Barcelona. He averaged 7.5 and 4.0 rebounds with Yukatel Merkezefendi.Nnaji and Barcelona -- the team he had been with since 2020 -- mutually agreed to part ways after the 2024-25 season.Most recently, he played with the Knicks in the 2025 Summer League.\nNnaji was listed at 6-feet-11 and 226 pounds when he was drafted as an 18-year-old, and Givony lists him as 7-feet and 251 pounds with a 7-7 wingspan currently.\"There was serious steam for Nnaji to work his way into the back end of the first round, so Charlotte moving up to acquire him at No. 31 feels like decent value here,\" Kyle Boone wrote of Nnaji when he was drafted. \"Nnaji's measurables in terms of his size and length are impressive and he's a big leaper who can finish above the rim, though he does present as something of a project for the Hornets.\"\nInstead, in a wild twist, he'll end up playing college basketball more than two years after being drafted. Baylor is 9-2 this season and has been without Juslin Bodo Bodo (arm) and Maikcol Perez (ACL), two expected front-court contributors.\n            \n    ",

He played through the injury in the team's next three games before missing three games to try to recover from the injury. In his first game back from that absence, he registered 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns.Overall, Bowers finishes the season with 64 receptions for 780 yards and seven touchdowns -- all team highs, but the first two categories significantly down from a historic 112-catch, 1,194-yard debut season. Bowers' 112 receptions were a rookie record, and his 1,194 yards were a rookie tight end record.\nThe Raiders finish the season with games against the New York Giants and against the Kansas City Chiefs. The Week 17 matchup in New York is an important one, as both teams sport 2-13 records, tied for the worst in the NFL. The loser of that game will take over the top spot in the NFL Draft order.Rice, 25, appeared in just 11 games. After being suspended the first six games of the season, he returned and provided an immediate spark to the offense, accruing 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns. However, he reported concussion symptoms after Week 15 and was inactive in Week 16. Now, with Kansas City's playoff hopes extinguished and Patrick Mahomes (ACL) done for the season, the Chiefs have shut down Rice as well.\nHere's a list of notable players whose seasons have come to an end due to an injury in the past few weeks.Dec. 24: Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee)Dec. 24: Chiefs WR Rashee Rice (concussion)Dec. 24: Chiefs CB Trent McDuffie (knee)Dec. 24: Dallas Cowboys OT Tyler Guyton (ankle)Dec. 23: New York Jets QB Justin Fields (knee)Dec. 23: Cincinnati Browns RB Quinshon Judkins (leg/ankle)Dec. 20: Cowboys CB DaRon Bland (foot)Dec. 20: Giants EDGE Kayvon ThibodeauxDec. 19: Jets QB Garrett Wilson (knee)Dec. 19: Minnesota Vikings OT Christian DarrisawDec. 17: Green Bay Packers EDGE Micah Parsons (ACL)Dec. 17: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes (ACL)Dec. 17: Vikings EDGE Jonathan Greenard (shoulder)Dec. 15: Washington Commanders QB Jayden Daniels (elbow)Dec. 13: Detroit Lions S Brian BranchDec. 13: Indianapolis Colts QB Daniel Jones (Achilles)Dec. 13: San Francisco 49ers WR Brandon Aiyuk (knee)Dec. 11: Cincinnati Bengals EDGE Trey Hendrickson (hip/pelvis)Dec. 1: Lions CB Terrion Arnold (shoulder)Nov. 26: Atlanta Falcons QB Michael Penix Jr. (ACL)\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nSportsLine NFL expert Jeff Hochman successfully nailed both of his Week 16 betting system picks, taking the Bengals against the Dolphins and the Raiders against the Texans when looking at teams who bounce back after being shut out in a loss. Hochman has shifted his focus to Week 17 and has identified a play under his system which looks at division games featuring low totals.NFL divisional underdogs in games with totals of 42 or lessWin Rate: 84-57-4 ATS (59.5%)Sample Size: Since 2013Criteria: Any divisional underdog in a game with a total of 42 or lessEdge: November and December outdoor gamesWhy does this work?There's something about Week 17 when division rivals meet. These teams know each other inside out, so games are scrappy and points are hard to come by. Oddsmakers aren't fooled— they set the totals low, figuring defense and weather will do their part. And the underdog? They get a few more points than usual, just because it's such a familiar battle. If you're paying attention, there's an edge to be found.Week 17 qualifiersCleveland Browns +3.5 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers | Confidence: 5 out of 5\nThe Browns feel like a good pick to cover +3.5 against the Steelers. If Pittsburgh already has the AFC North title wrapped up, you can bet the Steelers will sit their main guys. For Cleveland, this game is everything—the Browns will be fired up, especially with Myles Garrett chasing the sack record. Playing at home gives them a little extra juice, too. Even if the Steelers are the more talented team, the Browns have plenty of reasons to show up big.When Mike Tomlin was directly asked about resting starters if the division is clinched, he stated: \"It's possible.\" For a 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers nursing a left wrist injury, combined with the Steelers' extensive injury list (T.J. Watt out, Seumalo out, Pierre out, Herbig questionable), a rest scenario becomes operationally sensible. The Steelers currently hold the No. 4 seed—clinching before their contest means there's no seeding benefit to winning in Cleveland, only an increased injury risk before the playoffs.The Browns are out of the playoff hunt, sitting on the No. 3 overall pick with about a 25% shot at landing the top spot. While the 2026 draft isn't packed with quarterback talent, the 2027 class looks far more promising. But don't expect Cleveland to roll over just to boost its draft odds—especially not with the Steelers on the other side. These teams have a real rivalry, and pride always matters in this matchup. This asymmetry means the Browns may effectively be the more motivated team on the field—an unusual dynamic in a contest where Pittsburgh is 9-6 and Cleveland is 3-12.\nPittsburgh just lost its top receiver for the next two games—850 yards and 6 touchdowns out the window because of a suspension. Losing DK Metcalf really stings. He was targeted 99 times this season and was the Steelers' go-to guy for making things happen downfield. That leaves Pittsburgh counting on Adam Thielen, who's 34 and not exactly a picture of health, and Calvin Austin III, who's banged up and might not even play. Without Metcalf, it's a tall order for Rodgers—he's already throwing for just 6.9 yards per attempt (NFL average is 7.0), and his QBR (44.3) is well below average (50.0). With their best deep threat out, the Steelers could really struggle to keep drives alive or hit those big, momentum-shifting plays.This matchup really favors the Browns' pass rush going up against a shaky Steelers offensive line. Keep in mind, Pittsburgh is just 3-9 straight up when T.J. Watt is out. On top of that, the weather looks windy (15-25 mph), which could make throwing the ball tricky. Most of the public is loading up on the Steelers—73% of spread bets and 75% of the cash, per DraftKings. Take the points where you can, and don't shy away from sprinkling a little on the Browns' money line.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Things at the top of the NBA Draft Big Board are relatively stable from a month ago, but that may not last long. Questions about the durability (and availibilty) of Kansas' Darryn Peterson, coupled with the ascension of BYU's AJ Dybantsa and the exceptional play of Duke's Cameron Boozer have narrowed the gap for the No. 1  overall pick as we head into conference play.While those top three remain in a class among themselves, UNC power forward Caleb Wilson's consistency, athleticism, rebounding and versatile defensive tools are closing the gap. Meanwhile, Tennessee's Nate Ament has had some bumps in the road recently in the Volunteers' jumbo lineups, but is still the type of combo-forward that usually pans any well long-term in the association.Who's top point guard?There's also an interesting battle behind Peterson at the point guard position. Louisville's Mikel Brown is the most skilled of the bunch, while Houston's Kingston Flemings is the most explosive. Scouts are worried about Brown's durability and defense and still have questions about the sustainability of Flemings shooting. Arkansas' Darius Acuff meanwhile isn't the most explosive or skilled, but he very well may be the best college player.Flemings, who moved from No. 15 to No. 7 this month, isn't the only high-level athlete to make a jump. A month ago, it seemed almost aggressive to have Baylor's Cameron Carr on the fringe of the first round. That was until I got the chance to watch him live in Las Vegas at the Players Era and then it became clear that was way too low. With Carr's combination of length, athleticism, shot-making, and scoring, he's now played his way to the fringe of the lottery, even if he does have to keep building up his body.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Draft: 10 observations from a loaded Players Era event in Las Vegas\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWashington's Steinbach moves upThe most notable riser in the frontcourt is Washington's Hannes Steinbach. The freshman from Germany has real size and strength with great hands and a soft touch. He's a high-volume rebounder and showing some flashes of being able to stretch the floor. Steinbach's understanding of the nuances of ball-screen play is also exemplary. The way the NBA is now trending back towards bigger frontlines is also relevant, since he fits better in that better then he does four around one schemes.\nNew to the Big BoardThis iteration of the big board also includes some new names. Texas Tech's Christian Anderson and Duke's Patrick Ngongba are both making their debut, and making it in first-round territory. Questions about Anderson's size will linger, but his skill and productivity are undeniable. For Ngongba, the lack of lateral quickness will remain a concern, but the shot-blocking and floor-spacing is intriguing enough to compensate when he's healthy. Other notable newcomers include Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson (30), Wake Forest's Juke Harris (40), and Alabama's Amari Allen (44).\nBig Board Top 101Darryn PetersonKansasPG6-6205Fr2AJ DybantsaBYUSF6-9215Fr3Cameron BoozerDukePF6-9250Fr4Caleb WilsonNorth CarolinaPF6-10215Fr5Mikel BrownLouisvillePG6-4190Fr6Nate AmentTennesseePF6-10207Fr7Kingston FlemingsHoustonPG6-4190Fr8Jayden QuaintanceKentuckyC6-10255So9Koa PeatArizonaPF6-8235Fr10Thomas HaughFloridaSF6-9215JrThe Big Board has been updated to include the top 60 NBA Draft Prospects\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing, and with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Wednesday's Christmas Eve roundup just below. Yankees among teams interested in HaysVeteran outfielder Austin Hays is seeing his free agent market pick up. \nThe Yankees are among the teams with some level of interest in Hays, the New York Post reports. However, the Yankees would likely pursue Hays only if fellow outfielder Cody Bellinger, a core member of the Yankees last season and one of their top offseason targets, signs elsewhere. Hays has previously been reported to be of interest to the Mets and Royals. \nHays, 30, has a career OPS+ of 106 across parts of eight MLB seasons. Last season, he had an OPS+ of 105 for the Reds. He has a career WAR of 10.8, and in 2023 he earned his first and to date only All-Star selection as a member of the Orioles. For his career, Hays boasts an OPS of .819 against left-handed pitching. Marlins sign FairbanksThe Marlins have agreed to terms on a one-year, $13 million free agent contract with veteran reliever Pete Fairbanks, the Athletic reports. \nThe 32-year-old Fairbanks has served as the Rays' closer for the last three seasons, and earlier in the offseason CBS Sports ranked him as the No. 40 free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: \n\"Fairbanks was a late addition to the free-agent class when the Rays surprisingly declined his club option. He's always struggled with durability (this past season marked his first time clearing 50 innings in a year) and his strikeout rate is a shadow of its old self. That said, Fairbanks continues to possess a nasty slider and he should slot into a high-leverage role for someone.\"The Marlins were in need of high-leverage relief help, especially after Ronny Henriquez was lost to Tommy John surgery. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe University of Hawaii football team rarely has had to travel for a bowl game, as 23 of the 26 contests in which it appeared were played in the Aloha State. That advantage hasn't exactly translated to success, as the Rainbow Warriors went 10-13 in those bowls.Hawaii (8-4) has the opportunity to improve its record in local bowl games on Wednesday as it takes on California (7-5) at 8 p.m. ET in the 2025 Hawaii Bowl at the Clarence T.C. Ching Athletics Complex in Honolulu. The Rainbow Warriors, who appeared in now-defunct bowl games in their home state such as the Poi Bowl, Pineapple Bowl, Aloha Bowl and Oahu Bowl, have played in the Hawaii Bowl nine previous times -- most recently in 2019, when they posted a 38-34 victory over BYU.The Rainbow Warriors are 5-4 in the Hawaii Bowl and 12-14 overall in their bowl appearances after defeating Houston 28-14 in the 2020 New Mexico Bowl. California, which saw its bowl record fall to 12-13-1 with its 24-13 loss to UNLV in last year's LA Bowl, is making its second appearance in a bowl game held in Hawaii, with its first being a 42-38 loss to Navy in the 1996 Aloha Bowl. This year's Hawaii Bowl takes center stage on Wednesday, as there are no games on the NBA, NHL and college basketball schedules. The Rainbow Warriors are 1.5-point favorites against the Golden Bears in the latest consensus college football odds, with the over/under set at 51.5.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Wednesday, Dec. 24. All times EasternCFB best bets, where to watchHawaii Bowl: Hawaii vs. CaliforniaTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Honolulu | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: California -105 | Expert: Hawaii +1.5 (-110, Jeff Hochman)Both teams ended their regular seasons on a high note, as Hawaii defeated Wyoming 27-7 and California edged then-No. 21 SMU 38-35. This essentially is a home game for the Rainbow Warriors, who won six of their seven contests in Honolulu this year. The Golden Bears split their six road contests in 2025, with one of their victories coming in overtime against then-No. 15 Louisville. Cal quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, who is a native of Hawaii, is 18th in the nation with an average of 259.8 passing yards and has thrown for more than 300 yards in each of his team's last two wins. The freshman set a season high with four touchdown passes in the regular-season finale, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees him doing enough to pick up a victory in the Hawaii Bowl as the Golden Bears win in 59% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman (+542 on his last 16 college football against-the-spread picks) likes the fact that Hawaii is third in the country in red-zone scoring and has a plus-3.6 point differential with QB Micah Alejado, who is ninth nationally with 283.2 passing yards per game. Hochman managed to clock in early on the Rainbow Warriors and got them at +1.5.Looking aheadNFLLions at VikingsTime: 4:30 p.m., Thursday | Location: Minneapolis | TV: Netflix | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Lions -7.5 (-105) | Expert: Over 44.5 (-105, R.J. White)This is a must-win game for the Lions, whose hopes of making three consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 1993-95 are hanging by a thread. Detroit has lost three of its last four contests and needs to win out while the Green Bay Packers lose their final two games in order to earn a wild card berth. The Lions dropped a 27-24 decision to Minnesota at home in Week 9, and the Vikings enter the rematch with a three-game winning streak that has followed a four-game slide. Max Hosmer will be under center for Minnesota in place of J.J. McCarthy (hand), and the SportsLine Projection Model believes that will be a significant advantage for the Lions and is leaning toward a cover by Detroit. SportsLine NFL expert R.J. White (+458 on his last 33 NFL over/under picks) thinks the Lions will produce points as usual and the Vikings will do enough against Detroit's banged-up secondary for the Over to hit.Broncos at ChiefsTime: 8:15 p.m., Thursday | Location: Kansas City, Mo. | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Chiefs +13.5 (-112) | Expert: RJ Harvey Over 14.5 carries (-114, PropBetGuy)Kansas City's nine-year reign atop the AFC West is over and Denver already has secured its second straight playoff berth after enduring an eight-year drought. The race for a new division champion got tighter last week as the Broncos were beaten 34-20 at home by the Jacksonville Jaguars to end their 11-game winning streak and shrink their lead to one game over the Los Angeles Chargers, who topped the Cowboys 34-17 in Dallas for their fourth straight victory. The Chiefs have lost four in a row and are down to third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun as Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew are done for the season with knee injuries. Denver will be eager to atone for last week's performance and move closer to securing their first AFC West title since 2015, but the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't feel a blowout will occur as its simulations have the Chiefs covering the spread 60% of the time. Broncos running back RJ Harvey had only seven carries against Jacksonville after reaching double digits in each of his previous four outings, and SportsLine props expert PropBetGuy (43-25, +1433 on his last 68 NFL player prop picks) expects his workload to be much heavier this week.NBASpurs at ThunderTime: 2:30 p.m., Thursday | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Thunder -9.5 (-106)The NBA gave its fans a nice present when it scheduled a matchup between the top two teams in the Western Conference on Christmas Day. San Antonio has used a seven-game winning streak to get within 3 1/2 games of Oklahoma City, which won 24 of its first 25 games -- including 16 straight from Nov. 7-Dec. 10 -- but has lost three of its last five. Two of those defeats came against the Spurs, who ended the Thunder's lengthy winning streak with a 111-109 triumph in Las Vegas on Dec. 13 in the NBA Cup semifinals and cruised to a 130-110 victory at home two days ago. Stephon Castle was a major offensive contributor for San Antonio in both games, as he was one of three members of the team with 22 points in the first win and scored 24 on Tuesday. Reigning NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is second in the league in scoring with an average of 32.5 points, led all players in both contests with 29 and 33 points. The Thunder haven't lost back-to-back games since Apr. 4-6 of last season and have dropped three to the Spurs in one campaign only once since 2010-11. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Thunder answering the bell in a big way Thursday as they cover the large spread in 62% of its simulations.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The early returns on this rookie class have been nothing short of impressive. Just weeks into the season, first-year players across the league are already carving out meaningful roles, producing eye-catching stat lines and, in several cases, carrying their teams on a nightly basis. From top picks delivering star-level performances to less-heralded newcomers exceeding expectations, this group is quickly making a case as one of the strongest draft classes in recent memory. Below, we highlight 10 of the most impactful rookies so far, breaking down how each has translated their talent to the NBA level.Cooper Flagg, MavericksThe top pick of the draft has not disappointed one bit. He started off well with a 10-point, 10-rebound game in the season opener and averaged 16.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 3.3 assists over the first three games, with a high of 22 points in the third outing. His next season high came when he dropped 26 points, nine rebounds, and four assists on the Bucks in mid-November, which was then followed by a 29-point effort a couple of weeks later, and then a 35-point display in late-November versus the Clippers. From that point on, he has kept up an elevated rate of production, averaging 24.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists, one steal, and 1.3 blocks over the last 10 games, including a season-high 42-point outing against the Jazz in mid-December. Flagg looks ready and capable of helping to lead the way forward for the revamped Mavericks squad. Kon Knueppel, HornetsKnueppel was the fourth pick of the draft and took no time to show that he is the real deal, amassing 20 points on 7-for-12 shooting, including 5-for-9 from deep in just his third game. He followed up with 19 points in the next game, before delivering back-to-back five-point duds. He bounced back by hitting the 20-point mark in three straight games, capped with a 30-point effort against the Heat in early November. It took him just three more games to hit 30 points again, and he most recently reached a career high of 33 points. Knueppel is averaging 19.4 points on 47.4 percent shooting, including 41.9 percent from deep, and also hitting an impressive 89.5 percent from the foul line on the season. His overall play and achievements have already brought him into comparison with some of the best shooters in the league.VJ Edgecombe, 76ersThe third-overall pick, Edgecombe, took the league by storm by dropping 34 points on 13-for-26 shooting in his season debut. He continued the strong play and averaged 21.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.4 assists, and 1.2 steals through his first five games. He slowed down briefly but has since picked up his play again, averaging 22.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 3.6 assists over the last five games, including topping the 20-point mark in four straight. His 43.2 percent shooting from the field leaves room for improvement. However, he is hitting a hot 38.3 percent from deep, which adds to his dynamic presence and brings valuable dimension to the squad's offense, helping him maintain a starting role. \nDerik Queen, PelicansQueen got off to a quiet start, scoring in single digits in four of his first six games while playing out of a bench role. However, things took a turn after he delivered 26 points on 12-for-18 shooting in a mid-November outing. He earned his first start of the season two games later and has not looked back, averaging 15.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists, one steal, and 0.9 blocks over 19 consecutive games as a starter. He has already reached the 30-point mark twice, including a triple-double with a season-high 33 points to go with 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Aside from his ability to score, the young big man is showing an impressive knack for handling the ball and shining as a playmaker. With a six-foot-nine, 250-pound frame, he has the tools to develop into one of the league's most uncontainable big men. Jeremiah Fears, PelicansIt only took Fears two games to earn himself the starting point-guard job, as he amassed a total of 30 points on 12-for-18 shooting through 47 minutes of play across the two appearances. He came up a bit flat in his first showing as a starter, but since then, he is averaging 15.3 points, 3.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.4 steals in 27.3 minutes per game over 28 games. He has reached the 20-point mark on seven occasions and has racked up at least five assists in six games, with a season high of eight assists. At just 19 years of age, Fears is showing great promise to emerge as one of the league's most intriguing young guards. Cedric Coward, GrizzliesCoward got straight to business, averaging 19 points, 3.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists, and 1.7 steals in 22.7 minutes per game over his first three appearances, including a season-high 27 points in his third outing. He maintained solid production out of a bench role through the first 13 games before he took on a starting role that became available due to injuries in the lineup. He has done a good job with the increased responsibility, averaging 12.9 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists through 16 games as a starter, slowly solidifying a reputation as a well-rounded wing contributor, as he is averaging 1.4 made 3s per game and showing the ability to handle tough defensive matchups. \nRyan Kalkbrenner, HornetsKalkbrenner was granted a starting job to begin the season and stole the league's attention by averaging 11 points per game on incredible 90 percent shooting through his first five games. He has since slowed down but is still averaging 8.7 points on 78.7 percent shooting, which is on pace to lead the league. He also has recorded three games with double digits in rebounds, including two double-doubles. His knack for efficiency on the offensive side, combined with his average of 1.8 blocks per game, is a fantastic sign that he could grow into one of the league's more well-rounded centers. Dylan Harper, SpursThe second overall pick, Harper scored in double digits through his first six games, averaging 14 points, four rebounds, and 3.8 assists over that span, before going down with a calf injury that kept him out for just over two weeks. Nonetheless, he picked up where he left off, averaging 13.6 points, 2.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.1 steals through his first 10 games back in action, including a season-high 24-point effort. He has struggled scoring in the last few games, but has also showcased other aspects of his skillset, including delivering season highs of 10 assists and five steals in the last game. Harper is in an ideal situation, where he can grow as a key part of an impressive young core with the Spurs. Ryan Nembhard, MavericksNembhard had a slow start to the season, as he dealt with injury trouble that kept him sidelined through most of the first month of action. However, when he made his return in late November, he delivered seven assists with zero turnovers in 17 minutes off the bench. From there, he has started in 12 consecutive games, averaging 10.9 points, 2.5 rebounds, and seven assists over that span, including three games with at least 10 assists and a season high of 13. He is proving to be a well-disciplined playmaker and providing similar efficiency in his scoring, with a field-goal percentage of 48.5, including a blistering 41.3 percent from deep. \nAce Bailey, JazzBailey was the fifth pick of the draft. After a bit of a slow start, he is living up to the hype with three 20-point games under his belt already. He is averaging 12.9 points, 3.3 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 0.9 steals over 20 games since taking on a starting role, and he is showing poise by shooting an efficient 46.8 percent from the field and 38.3 percent from deep over that span. At 6-foot-9, 200 pounds, he has great size for a wing player, especially considering that he is just 19 years old. Bailey should continue to flourish as part of a developing Jazz core.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Something serious is happening in San Antonio, where the Spurs handed the Thunder a 130-110 loss on Tuesday to move into sole possession of the Western Conference's No. 2 seed at 22-7. The Spurs have now given OKC half of its four losses this season, both coming over the last 10 days. The Thunder, who lost just once through their first 25 games, have actually lost three of their last five, with the other defeat coming at the hands of the Timberwolves, who have very quietly won 10 of their last 12. If you truly want to believe OKC is beatable, this is your time as the ease of their early schedule turns upside down. Zooming out, the consensus remains that the top of the Western Conference belongs to the Thunder, Nuggets and Rockets. The Lakers are a wild card. The Timberwolves are trying to knock on the door. But at the moment, the Spurs are the team that is threatening to kick the damn thing down, if they haven't already. Would it be easier to slap the \"few years away\" tag on the Spurs? Sure. Give them time, everyone would like to say. Think long term. Let the supporting cast develop. Hell, let Victor Wembanyama develop. The guy is barely old enough to drink legally.\nBut what if this is really happening right now? Take an honest look at this team and find a reason why they can't beat anyone in a seven-game series that doesn't include \"they're just not ready.\" Do they not have a superstar? Do they not have a second offensive star? Are they not deep enough? Not versatile enough? Do they not have the sixth-best shooting percentage (including a top-10 3-point percentage) in the league? Do they not have multiple ball handlers and playmakers? Do they not have a top-five offense and defense? OK, you got me. They're sixth in defense. Seriously, what non-narrative, strictly basketball argument can you make that Spurs aren't an elite team? If you've got one, I'd love to hear it. Until then, let's talk about why this bright future everyone likes to put off in the distance has actually already arrived. Wemby changes everythingWe know how much Victor Wembanyama changes a basketball game, and yet I'm not sure we are ready to fully accept how much that changes a postseason outlook that we still want to believe is about experience over all else. A lot of people said the same thing about the Warriors in 2015. The masses just weren't ready to see what Stephen Curry was doing and how much it was changing everything we knew about the game. \nIndeed, Wembanyama warps defensive space in the same way Curry does offensive space. The range from which he can destroy your offense is a geometric anomaly. Jump shooters have to change their entire calculus when he's closing out. Drivers require multiple extra steps of separation to avoid erasure, and they're still looking over their shoulder. Wemby doesn't just blocks shots (incidentally, his streak of 101 straight games with at least one block ended on Tuesday); he scares you into not even taking them. To say this changes everything is an understatement, and it's also to say nothing about Wemby's own offensive dominance, where he shatters everything you thought you knew about spacing and potential ground coverage. Giannis has given us a taste of this, but not before Wembanyama did you ever have consider the possibility that a guy might take a roll pass from the top of the circle and easily get home without taking a single dribble. Since his return from a month-long calf-strain absence, Wembanyama has been coming off the bench and has only played 20 minutes per game, and still he averaged 17.8 points, 9.2 rebounds and two blocks on 56% shooting over his first six games back (this includes the NBA Cup championship that doesn't technically count toward stats). \nThere isn't a single other player in the league who has met these statistical bars this season, and this guy has come back from a month off to do it in 20 minutes a night off the bench. Per 36 minutes (roughly what he played in seven November games), Wembanyama has averaged 31 points, 16 rebounds, 5 assists and 3.5 blocks on 56% shooting, including 42% from 3, in his five official December games. All told, he's the only player in the league averaging at least 23 points, 10 rebounds, three assists and three blocks, and he's clearing those numbers comfortably. He is truly matchup proof. Put a big man on him and he's making him look foolish with his handle and array of shot making (ask Anthony Davis, one of the better big man defenders in the world, who tasted the full seasoning of Wemby's 40-piece cooking in the season opener). Put a small defender on him (as has been a frequent strategy), and he's rising up for jumpers with an shot-contest imperviousness that makes Kevin Durant jealous. On top of it all, the guy might be one of the league few truly competitive psychopaths. Victor Wembanyama is a monster. We know this. What we didn't know, or at least what we weren't so sure about, was just how good the rest of the Spurs were going to be. \nAn elite support staffPrior to the season, you didn't have to be a basketball savant to look at the Spurs' roster and point to a lot of really good players outside of Wemby, but when they went 9-3 while Wembanyama was out with a major win over the Nuggets, it was a real eye-opener. This team is a lot more than just Wembanyama. Stephon Castle is making 60% of his 2-pointers and looks like a Jimmy Butler in the making. When he and Wemby have been on the court together, San Antonio has outscored opponents by more than 14 points per 100 possessions with what would rank as the No. 1 defense in the league, per Cleaning the Glass. De'Aaron Fox averaged 25.5 points and 6.8 assists on 48/40/83 shooting splits in the month Wemby was out. He is the second star you need in a postseason series where every opponent is going to do everything in its power to limit Wembanyama. Devin Vassell is having one of the best seasons you've likely heard nothing about. There are two kinds of good shooters in basketball: Those who look to shoot, and those who can't wait to shoot. Vassell can't wait. He hunts shots like prime Klay Thompson. He's shooting 40% from 3 on seven attempts a night and has the league's 13th-highest \"Win probability added\" number, both overall and in the Clutch, via Inpredictable. Harrison Barnes leads the league with 35 corner 3s and is shooting 40% from beyond the arc overall. He is a perfect 3-and-D role player until you start thinking that's all he can do, at which point he overpowers you with back-to-the-basket force, show-and-go drives and crafty interior footwork. Luke Kornet is what Isaiah Hartenstein is to the Thunder: The No 2 big who is actually a No. 1. Scorers are shooting over four percentage points worse when defended by Kornet -- a number right in line with Anthony Davis -- and when Kornet has been with the starters in place of Wembanyama the Spurs have won those minutes by over 11 points per 100 possessions, per CTG.Keldon Johnson should be in Sixth Man of the Year conversations. He is pure energy and has been incredible getting downhill as a powerful paint scorer. His 57% mid-range clip is top 10 among wings. His 132.7 points per 100 shot attempts ranks in the 93rd percentile, per CTG. He went for 25 on five 3-pointers in the Tuesday win over OKC.  Dylan Harper is going to be an absolute stud when he starts to shoot and score more efficiently, but in the meantime he's already a major impact player as basically a third point guard. The No. 2 overall pick can get two feet in the paint whenever he wants. He's strong. Forceful. Over San Antonio's last two NBA Cup elimination games he combined for 45 points on 8-of-12 3-point shooting, then he turned around and was one of the best players on the floor against OKC with only four points, tallying 10 assists and five steals with zero turnovers in 20 minutes. All of this speaks to a level of versatility that makes San Antonio a scary postseason threat. It would be one thing if Wembanyama had to play superman at 21 years old over night, but he doesn't (even if he's sort of a superhero just in his natural state). That would burn out. But the Spurs can beat you a bunch of ways with a bunch of different catalysts. Consider that on Tuesday night the Spurs got 12 points from Wemby, six points from Fox, four points from Harper, and beat the best team in the world by 20 points. Over their last eight games, they have had seven different leading scorers. Eight guys are averaging double-digit points. Nine are playing at least 20 minutes a night. \nJeremy Sochan might be their best perimeter defender and is barely a rotation player because the Spurs don't have to forfeit offense for defense, or vice versa. Everyone they put on the floor can do everything. In a postseason setting, to have three primary ball handlers, all of whom share that duty when they share the floor, and at least four premium individual shot creators is a luxury very few teams enjoy. The Spurs can play small. They can do the two-big thing -- with Wembanyama and Kornet on the court they are outscoring opponents by 7.8 points per 100 possessions with an basically impenetrable 100.9 defensive rating, per CTG. Again, I defy anyone to find me a reason that the Spurs shouldn't be considered a legitimate threat to beat any team in the world in a seven-game series. That's not to suggest they will win the whole thing, or hell, even get out of the first round. The Western Conference is a bloodbath. It's just to say they're just as capable as any non-OKC team and, well, they've beaten OKC twice with a chance to do it again on Christmas. \nThe Spurs are, right now, one of the five best teams in the league without a question, and if you're a top five team, you are, by any definition, ready. The fact that they're going to be even better in the years to come is another, even scarier story. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Earlier this week, South Carolina's women's basketball team made a stunning announcement: French phenom Alicia Tournebize has signed with the school and will join the team after the holiday break. Tournebize, a 6-foot-7 center who has been playing professionally in France for Bourges Basket, will be eligible to play immediately. \"Alicia has an incredible skill set and basketball IQ,\" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said in a press release. \"She has great touch around the rim, can shoot it out to the 3-point line and is a shot blocker. We're excited that she and her family chose to bring her game to Columbia, and the FAMS are going to enjoy what she adds to our team on the court and off.\"Ahead of South Carolina's return to action on Dec. 28 against Providence, let's take a closer look at this unique midseason acquisition. Who is Tournebize, and how could she help the Gamecocks' title hopes? The basicsPosition: CenterHeight: 6-feet-7Previous club: Bourges BasketCountry: FranceAge: 18Tournebize has been a name to watch among international prospects for a few years, but she really burst onto the scene this summer due to her breakout performance for France at the FIBA U18 Women's EuroBasket tournament. She averaged 12.1 points, 8.9 rebounds and 1.9 blocks on 54.9% shooting to help France win the bronze medal, and was named to the All-Star Five. \nDuring the bronze medal game against Belgium, she threw down a huge two-handed slam that went viral. \nTournebize has been playing professionally for Bourges Basket, who participate in La Boulangère Wonderligue (the top professional women's basketball league in France) and EuroLeague (a pan-European competition to crown the best team on the continent, akin to the Champions League in soccer). Due to her age and inexperience, Tournebize played sparingly for Bourges this season in both the LBW and EuroLeague. Her stats were almost identical in both competitions: 7.6 minutes, 2.9 points, 1.7 rebounds in the LBW and 7.3 minutes, 2.4 points and 1.9 rebounds in EuroLeague. \nWhy now?Player developmentWe don't have a specific answer from Tournebize, who was not quoted in South Carolina's press release, and only gave a brief quote in Bourges' press release that did not address her decision-making process. \"Bourges has helped me grow, both on and off the court. I am leaving today with everything I have learned here and with the desire to proudly represent the colors of my training club,\" Tournebize said, as translated into English. A statement from the club, again translated into English, does note that the move was made to \"prioritize the player's development. Here's Bourges' statement:\n\"This decision, which was carefully considered and reached through respectful dialogue, reflects the shared desire of both parties to prioritize the player's development while preserving the club's sporting integrity, in accordance with the mutual commitments set out in a settlement agreement.\"As previously mentioned, Tournebize was playing limited minutes for Bourges this season, and it's difficult for teenagers to earn more substantial roles overseas. At South Carolina, there's a clear pathway for Tournebize to become one of the Gamecocks' key players -- if not this season, then certainly in years to come. Staley is also one of the best coaches in all of basketball, and has a proven track record of developing bigs into top WNBA draft picks. Tournebize will have a chance to follow in the footsteps of A'ja Wilson, Aliyah Boston and Kamilla Cardoso. \nFamily historyIt's also worth noting that Tournebize's mother, French legend Isabelle Fijalkowski, came over to the States and played college basketball for Colorado before going on to the WNBA. Tournebize's mother would have been able to advise her on the benefits of playing college basketball. Potential payday?In terms of money, South Carolina's release stated that Tournebize was on a \"training-intern contract.\" It's unclear how much she was making for Bourges, but the nature of her status as a \"training-intern\" suggests it wasn't a lucrative deal. There are restrictions on international student athletes' ability to make money through NIL deals and direct payments from schools, but it is now possible, if complicated, for them to get paid. Depending on what South Carolina is able to work out, it is possible Tournebize could earn more in Columbia than she was in France. \nWhat does Tournebize bring to the Gamecocks?SizeTournebize's size is an obvious benefit. At 6-foot-7, she will immediately be the tallest player on the team, and one of the tallest players in the country. Per CBB Analytics, there are currently only six Division I women's basketball players standing 6-foot-7 or taller. Sania Feigin graduated and the Gamecocks are missing both Ashlyn Watkins (away from basketball) and Chloe Kitts (torn ACL) this season, which has decimated their frontcourt depth. Madina Okot and Joyce Edwards are the only players above 6-foot-1 who play significant minutes. Due to injuries, the Gamecocks have often had only eight available players, and simply having another player who can contribute will be a big boost. (South Carolina's 17.5 bench points per game ranks 198th in the country.) That Tournebize will help their frontcourt depth is even better for Staley. \nTournebize is slim, and may struggle at times to deal with more physical players in the paint. A full offseason with South Carolina will help change that moving forward, though. AthleticismTournebize moves very well for her size, and can get up and down the floor. She's also agile with good footwork and lateral mobility, which helps her in halfcourt situations on both sides of the ball. And, of course, there aren't many players throwing down dunks like she did this summer for France. Paint presenceTournebize's size makes her a real presence in the paint on both sides of the ball. At U18 EuroBasket this summer, she scored efficiently around the basket, and was fourth in rebounds and fourth in blocks for the tournament. Again, she needs to become stronger, but her height and length will help her make an immediate impact. \nMid-range gameTournebize rarely steps behind the arc, but she is comfortable in the mid-range, where she has a smooth jumper. For a team that takes 62.4% of its field goal attempts in the paint, having a big who can provide any kind of spacing is going to be helpful. \nTournebize is only 18 years old, and will be adjusting to a new country, a new coaching staff, new teammates and a new league. She's not going to step on the floor and immediately start dominating, and she may not even play that much, especially initially. However, Staley wouldn't have brought her over midseason if she didn't think she could help, and adding a player as talented as Tournebize is a real boost for the Gamecocks. Other title contenders are not making this sort of addition ahead of the new year. The 12-1 Gamecocks, who lost in the national championship game last season, are ranked No. 3 in the country and are one of the main contenders looking to knock UConn off its throne.  \nHow does this affect Tournebize's WNBA Draft prospects?One of the more interesting aspects of this move is that it actually delays Tournebize's WNBA draft eligibility. Under the current rules -- which could be subject to change in the new collective bargaining agreement -- international prospects must turn 20 in the year in which the draft takes place, while domestic prospects must turn 22 in the the year in which the draft takes place. Once Tournebize begins playing in the NCAA, that will make her a domestic prospect. \nIf Tournebize had stayed overseas, she would have been eligible for the 2027 WNBA Draft. Now, barring any changes to the rules, she'll have to wait for the 2029 WNBA Draft. Has this ever happened before?While Tournebize is the most high-profile example, she is not the first international player to sign with a school during the middle of the season. Auburn added Chinese guard Yuting Deng in January just last season (Deng has since transferred and now plays for Baylor), and Egyptian center Jana El Alfy joined UConn in January of 2023, though she did not play with the team until the following season. Furthermore, two Australian prospects, center Callie Hinder (Arizona) and forward Zoe Jackson (Indiana) will join their respective schools this January, though both plan to redshirt and will not play this season. There are also examples of this happening on the men's side of college basketball. Israeli center Yonatan Levy joined UW-Green Bay in January last season (he has since transferred to Pepperdine) and Russian big man Kirill Elatontsev will suit up for Oklahoma starting in January. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season has been full of drama, but that drama might not carry over into the final week of the season. Heading into Week 17, there are still four playoff spots up for grabs and seven division races that haven't been decided, which seems like a recipe for a dramatic finish over the final two weeks. The problem for the NFL is that there's a nightmare scenario where almost every division race comes to an end and every playoff spot gets clinched in Week 17 and it's a scenario that's not too far-fetched. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, there has never been a season where EVERY playoff spot and EVERY division was clinched before the final week of the season, so this would definitely be an unwanted situation by the NFL. Let's break down the NFL's nightmare scenario: AFC WESTThere are two notable games with playoff implications in the AFC West this weekend: Broncos at ChiefsTexans at ChargersHow the division race could end this week: A Denver win on Christmas Day combined with a Chargers loss to Houston would clinch the AFC West for the Broncos. \nAFC NORTHThere are two games in the AFC North that could lead to the division race ending: Ravens at PackersSteelers at BrownsHow the division race could end this week:  A win by Green Bay would clinch a playoff spot for the Packers AND it would also clinch the AFC North for the Steelers. That seems like the kind of result that would cause a nightmare for the NFL, so let's assume that happens. AFC SOUTHThere are two big games happening in the AFC South in Week 17: Texans at ChargersJaguars at Colts Breakdown: In our nightmare scenario for the NFL, we have the Texans beating the Chargers, so there's no way the Jaguars would be able to clinch the division in Week 17. \nAFC EASTThe Patriots could win the AFC East this week. Let's check out the two games that will have an impact on the division race: Patriots at JetsEagles at BillsHow the division race could end this week: If the Patriots beat the Jets and the Bills lose to Philadelphia, then New England will clinch the division title, and that's exactly what we're going to have happen in our nightmare scenario. Now, let's head to the NFC. There are only three division races going on in this conference because the Eagles have already clinched the NFC East. \nNFC NORTHThe Bears are the only team that has clinched a playoff spot in the NFC North, but that could change this week: Bears at 49ersRavens at PackersHow the division race could end this week: The Bears will win the division with a win over the 49ers while the Packers can clinch a playoff spot with a win over the Ravens. In our nightmare scenario, we'll say the Bears beat the 49ers and the Packers beat the Ravens. (The Lions are still alive in the playoff race, but we're not going to worry about them here. If they lose to the Vikings on Christmas, they'll be eliminated. Even if they win on Christmas, they'd still be eliminated on Saturday if Green Bay beats Baltimore). NFC SOUTHThere are two huge games happening in the NFC South this week: Seahawks at PanthersBuccaneers at DolphinsHow the division race could end this week: The Panthers will win the division with a win over the Seahawks combined with a Dolphins win over the Buccaneers and for the sake of our nightmare scenario, we'll assume that happens. \nNFC WESTThe NFC West already has three playoff teams and all three teams can still clinch the No. 1 overall seed. Here's a look at the big games in this division in Week 17: Seahawks at PanthersBears at 49ersRams at Falcons Breakdown: For the sake of our nightmare scenario, we'll say the Seahawks and 49ers both lose while the Rams win. If all of this happens, six of the eight division races would be decided and all 14 playoff spots would be clinched, which would certainly be a nightmare scenario heading into Week 18. \nHere's what the playoff standings would look like if our nightmare scenario played out in Week 17:  AFC1. Broncos -- AFC West winner2. Patriots -- AFC East winner3. Jaguars -- AFC South leader4. Steelers -- AFC North winner5. Texans -- Clinched playoff spot6. Chargers -- Clinched playoff spot7. Bills -- Clinched playoff spotNFC1. Bears -- NFC North winner2. Rams -- NFC West leader3. Eagles -- NFC East winner4. Panthers -- NFC South winner5. Seahawks -- Clinched playoff spot6. 49ers -- Clinched playoff spot7. Packers -- Clinched playoff spot\nThe NFL doesn't announce the Week 18 schedule until Week 17 is over and with this scenario, it would be almost impossible to come up with an entertaining schedule for the final week of the season. The league needs a doubleheader for Saturday and a prime-time game for Sunday, but there wouldn't be a single game with a \"win-and-in\" scenario. The No. 1 seed in both the NFC and AFC would be up for grabs, so the NFL would likely focus on those. You could put Chargers-Broncos in the Sunday night spot because Denver would likely be playing for the No. 1 seed, but if the Patriots and Jaguars both lost earlier in the day, then the game would mean nothing to Denver. You could put Seahawks-49ers on Sunday night, but if the Rams beat the Cardinals earlier in the day, then L.A. would clinch the NFC West and the Seattle-San Francisco game would only be for wild card seeding. \nYou could put Lions-Bears on Sunday night. Assuming our nightmare scenario plays out in Week 17, the Bears would likely be playing for the No. 1 seed. The NFL doesn't like to put an eliminated team in the Sunday night slot, but it's not unprecedented. In 2022, the Lions were already eliminated but they got scheduled in the Sunday night game against a Packers team that needed a win to get to the playoffs. The Lions had nothing to play for, but they still managed to pull off a 20-16 stunner that kept Green Bay out of the postseason. Of course, the problem with putting Lions-Bears on Sunday night would be that if the Rams lost to Arizona, then the Bears would have already clinched the top seed heading into the game and they'd have nothing to play for. If there aren't any great options, the NFL could always just scrap the Sunday night game and that's exactly what happened in 2017, so there is precedent for that (You can read about the details of that situation here). Last year, the final game was between the Lions and Vikings with the winner earning the No. 1 seed in the NFC and the loser getting stuck in the wild card round. The Lions ended up thrashing Minnesota 31-9 to earn the NFC's only bye. A similar scenario could play out this year if both the Seahawks (at Panthers) and 49ers (vs. Bears) win on Sunday. If that happens, the NFC West and No. 1 seed would be on the line when the two teams meet in Week 18. You can bet the NFL would love to see that scenario and not the nightmare one I put together here. \n            ",

The 39-year-old Johnson replaced Mariota under center late in the 29-18 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last Saturday, and completed 5 of 9 passes for 43 yards and one interception.Johnson will be the fourth-oldest quarterback to start a game this season, behind Joe Flacco, Aaron Rodgers and grandfather Philip Rivers. He has been on the active rosters of 13 different NFL teams, and played snaps for seven. That includes a stint with Washington during its dramatic 2018 campaign. After starting 5-2 that year, Alex Smith went down with a horrific leg injury. Colt McCoy replaced him in the lineup before he also suffered a leg injury. That resulted in Mark Sanchez being pushed into the starting lineup before he was benched for Johnson. The former fifth-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft actually sparked Washington's offense, and led the Commanders to a 16-13 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 15. It was the only win Washington registered that season after Smith's injury. In his career, Johnson is 1-8 as a starter, and has thrown for 2,340 yards, 13 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. \nThe Commanders are not the only NFL team that will be starting a third-string signal-caller on Christmas. The Minnesota Vikings are playing Max Brosmer against the Detroit Lions, while Chris Oladokun will start for the Kansas City Chiefs against the Denver Broncos. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL introduced the high-impact player rule on Tuesday, a mechanism intended to attract and keep top players in the league — if a complicated one.Starting July 1, the league's teams will be able to exceed the salary cap by $1 million, rather than simply adding to the cap in a move that the NWSL Players Association has advocated for. The players eligible for the new rule, though, cannot simply be selected at the team's discretion. The rule's language includes detailed criteria that players must meet in order to qualify for the high-impact rule, the list of items ranging from international minutes played to end-of-year awards and media recognition.The NWSL requires that players meet just one of seven criteria, which technically creates a long list of talent for clubs to choose from. The eligible players are the usual suspects for a rule such as this one — free agent Trinity Rodman qualifies for it, as do the likes of Marta and Esther Gonzalez. Yet, the net may not actually be wide enough for a lot of players who would reasonably be considered top quality, outlining some flaws in the NWSL's first attempt to create a more competitive salary structure.Criteria for NWSL's high-impact player rulePlayer is on SportsPro Media Top 150 Most Marketable Athletes within the one (1) year prior to the current league season; or,Player is selected in the Top 30 in Ballon d'Or voting in the two (2) years prior to the current league season; orPlayer is selected in the Top 40 of the Guardian Top 100 football players in the world in the two (2) years prior; orPlayer is selected in the Top 40 of ESPN FC Top 50 football players in the world in the two (2) years prior; orTop 11 minutes played for the USWNT in the prior two (2) calendar years for field players for all competition types; orTop one (1) in minutes played for USWNT in the prior two (2) calendar years for goalkeepers for all competition types; orPlayer selected as NWSL MVP Finalist within previous the two (2) league seasons; orPlayer selected to the End of Year NWSL Best XI First Team within the previous two (2) league seasonsPlayers eligible in five to seven categoriesPLAYERCLUB TEAMNATIONALITYBarbra BandaOrlando PrideZambiaTemwa ChawingaKansas City CurrentMalawiEsther GonzalezGotham FCSpainLindsey HeapsOL LyonnesUnited StatesMartaOrlando PrideBrazilTrinity Rodmanfree agentUnited StatesSophia WilsonPortland ThornsUnited StatesWhether it was by design or not, the high-impact player rule seems tailor made to accommodate the Washington Spirit's attempts to re-sign Rodman, which fueled the conversation around the salary cap in the first place. Rodman is one of two players eligible via all criteria, though players are only required to check one box off the list. Here, she's joined by a handful of the NWSL's top players, the list of criteria benefitting the league's best performers, though they have easily earned applause from international awards bodies and media. U.S. women's national team captain Lindsey Horan, meanwhile, falls in five categories on the back of her work with OL Lyonnes and on the international stage. Sophia Wilson's 2024 showing, which included a nomination for the NWSL's MVP award and a starring role in the USWNT's Olympic gold medal-winning run, also made her eligible in all categories and allowed her to stay eligible despite spending all of 2025 on maternity leave.\nPlayers eligible in three to four categoriesPLAYERCLUB TEAMNATIONALITYSandy BaltimoreChelseaFranceAnn-Katrin BergerGotham FCGermanyAitana BonmatiBarcelonaSpainLucy BronzeChelseaEnglandKlara BuhlBayern MunichGermanyMariona CaldenteyArsenalSpainDelphine CascarinoSan Diego WaveFranceTabitha ChawingaOL LyonnesMalawiSam CoffeyPortland ThornsUnited StatesMelchie DumornayOL LyonnesHaitiEmily FoxArsenalUnited StatesCristiana GirelliJuventusItalyNaomi GirmaChelseaUnited StatesCaroline Graham HansenBarcelonaNorwayPatricia GuijarroBarcelonaSpainHannah HamptonChelseaEnglandPernille HarderBayern MunichDenmarkYui HasegawaManchester CityJapanLauren HempManchester CityEnglandLauren JamesChelseaEnglandMarie-Antoinette KatotoOL LyonnesFranceChloe KellyArsenalEnglandManaka MatsukuboNorth Carolina CourageJapanAlyssa NaeherChicago StarsUnited States (ret.)Ewa PajorBarcelonaPolandSalma ParallueloBarcelonaSpainClaudia PinaBarcelonaSpainAlexia PutellasBarcelonaSpainMayra RamirezChelseaColombiaKhadija ShawManchester CityJamaicaMallory SwansonChicago StarsUnited StatesKeira WalshChelseaEnglandCaroline WeirReal MadridScotlandLeah WilliamsonArsenalEnglandHere, there's a healthier mix of NWSL talent and players who have excelled for club teams abroad like USWNT standout Coffey and three-time Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati. Like Wilson, Swanson's 2024 performance allowed her to stay in the running despite also going on maternity leave in 2025. Alyssa Naeher is also eligible thanks to her success in 2024, her final year with the national team before announcing her international retirement, but she is bolstered by a quirk of the high-impact player rule – only one USWNT goalkeeper can qualify through the minutes played category, and she has the most minutes of any shot-stopper despite opting out before the 2025 schedule began. Head coach Emma Hayes' choice to rotate through her options in a year without a major tournament had plenty of sporting merit, but the NWSL's construction of the new rule has disadvantaged the team's other goalkeepers.Players eligible in one to two categoriesPLAYERCLUB TEAMNATIONALITYMichelle AgyemangBrighton and Hove AlbionEnglandSelma BachaOL LyonnesFranceOna BatlleBarcelonaSpainAggie Beaver-JonesChelseaEnglandCroix BethuneWashington SpiritUnited StatesStina BlacksteniusArsenalSwedenJule BrandOL LyonnesGermanyMillie BrightChelseaEngland (ret.)Linda CaicedoReal MadridColombiaSofia CantoreWashington SpiirtItalyOlga CarmonaParis Saint-GermainSpainSteph CatleyArsenalAustraliaCata CollBarcelonaSpainErin CuthbertChelseaScotlandTierna DavidsonGotham FCUnited StatesKadidatou DianiOL LyonnesFranceCrystal DunnParis Saint-GermainUnited StatesMary EarpsParis Saint-GermainEngland (ret.)Grace GeyoroLondon City LionessesFranceManuela GiuglianoRomaItalyAlex GreenwoodManchester CityEnglandAmanda GutierresBoston LegacyBrazilAda HegerbergOL LyonnesNorwayClaire HuttonKansas City CurrentUnited StatesCasey KruegerWashington SpiirtUnited StatesKaleigh KurtzDenver SummitUnited StatesRose LavelleGotham FCUnited StatesMapi LeonBarcelonaSpainVicky LopezBarcelonaSpainLorenaKansas City CurrentBrazilFrida MaanumArsenalNorwayClara MateoParis FCFranceKatie McCabeArsenalIrelandTara McKeownWashington SpiritUnited StatesBeth MeadArsenalEnglandOlivia MoultriePortland ThornsUnited StatesJenna NighswongerArsenalUnited StatesSjoeke NuskenChelseaGermanyIrene ParedesBarcelonaSpainAvery PattersonHouston DashUnited StatesAlexandra PoppWolfsburgGermanyGabi PortilhoGotham FCBrazilGuro ReitenChelseaNorwayIzzy RodriguezKansas City CurrentUnited StatesFridolina RolfoManchester UnitedSwedenAlessai RussoArsenalEnglandJohanna Rytting KanerydChelseaSwedenEmily SamsOrlando PrideUnited StatesLea SchullerBayern MunichGermanyKayla SharplesKansas City CurrentUnited StatesKorbin ShraderOL LyonnesUnited StatesEmily SonnettGotham FCUnited StatesGeorgia StanwayBayern MunichEnglandTarcianeOL LyonnesBrazilGlodis Perla ViggosdottirBayern MunichIcelandBia ZanerattoKansas City CurrentBrazilAs arbitrary as it seems to include media-generated rankings, some of these lists may have actually saved the NWSL's skin by ensuring a lot of players eligible for the high-impact rule. Colombia standout Linda Caicedo is only eligible for the new rule because she cracked the top 40 of The Guardian and ESPN's list at least once in the last two years, for example. Barcelona's Vicky Lopez, who won the Kopa Trophy at this year's Ballon d'Or ceremony in an award rewarding top young players, and Women's Euro young player of the tournament Michelle Agyemang, also only made the cut through their inclusion on these lists, a signal that the high-impact rule may exclude the game's rising talents at times.Select players who did not make the cutThere are some surprising names who are not currently eligible under the high-impact player rule, chief among them USWNT attacker Catarina Macario, who ESPN reports is receiving interest from clubs in the NWSL. Granted, many NWSL teams already have players who do qualify and can likely shift one of those players to a new-look contract in order to accommodate a player like Macario but the limitations of the rule are hard to ignore. Macario was unable to check off any of the boxes because she spent multiple years recovering from an ACL injury and it is a similar case for Australia star Sam Kerr. \nA batch of the USWNT's most promising young players also do not qualify, including but not limited to Lily Yohannes and Alyssa Thompson. Additionally, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, a likely successor to Naeher as the USWNT's first-choice goalkeeper, is also out of the running because of the constructs around shot-stoppers. Most glaringly, though, is the exclusion of Lizbeth Ovalle – she was the subject of a record transfer fee when the Orlando Pride signed her from Tigres in August but she did not meet the NWSL's criteria, raising questions about why teams should not be able to utilize the high-impact player rule at their discretion.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just two weeks are left in the 2025 NFL regular season, but there's still plenty left to be sorted out with the impact of each remaining game seemingly rising by the week. Fourteen teams are eliminated from playoff contention, and just two playoff spots in each conference are still up for grabs. However, seven of the NFL's eight division titles have yet to be claimed. Here's how the AFC standings have shaken out with just two weeks left to play: Denver Broncos (12-3, lead AFC West, clinched playoff berth)New England Patriots (12-3, lead AFC East, clinched playoff berth)Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4, lead AFC South, clinched playoff berth)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6, lead AFC North)Los Angeles Chargers (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Buffalo Bills (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Houston Texans (10-5)Indianapolis Colts (8-7)Baltimore Ravens (7-8)Here's how the NFC standings stack up with the defending Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles being the first team in 2025 to clinch a division title. Both the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers can only reach the postseason as the NFC South champion, and the Detroit Lions can only make the playoffs as the No. 7 seed. Seattle Seahawks (12-3, lead NFC West, clinched playoff berth)Chicago Bears (11-4, lead NFC North, clinched playoff berth)  Philadelphia Eagles (10-5, clinched NFC East)Carolina Panthers (8-7, lead NFC South)San Francisco 49ers (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Los Angeles Rams (11-4, clinched playoff berth)Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)Detroit Lions (8-7)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)With so many permutations remaining, here is a look at some of the most impactful games of the Week 17 slate as they relate to the postseason, plus a battle for the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick.\n        \n            \n                NFL facing possible nightmare playoff scenario in Week 17 that could kill the drama in final week of season\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThursday (Christmas Day)Lions (8-7) at Vikings (7-8)The Detroit Lions enter Week 17 with just a 5.1% chance to reach the postseason, according to CBS' SportsLine model because they need a lot to go their way. They need to win out at the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas and then knock off the NFC North-leading Bears in Chicago in Week 18. Even if they win out, they also need the Green Bay Packers to lose in Week 17 when they host the Baltimore Ravens and in Week 18 at the Minnesota Vikings. That's their only path back to the postseason. \nGetting swept by the Packers and losing five of their last eight games since returning from their bye week in Week 9 has put the Lions in a precarious position. Good news for Detroit is Minnesota will be starting backup quarterback Max Brosmer in place of the injured J.J. McCarthy, who suffered a hand injury in Week 16. Brosmer threw four interceptions in a 26-0 loss at the Seattle Seahawks back in Week 13. Broncos (12-3) at Chiefs (6-9)The Denver Broncos can clinch the AFC West division this week with a win, plus a Los Angeles Chargers defeat against the Houston Texans. Denver will be blessed with the opportunity to face Chiefs third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, a 2022 seventh-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who spent the last four seasons on Kansas City's practice squad, in his first career start. SaturdayTexans (10-5) at Chargers (11-4)The Houston Texans can return to the playoffs for the third year in a row by simply beating the Los Angeles Chargers at SoFi Stadium or by the Indianapolis Colts losing against the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. An AFC West title is still on the table for the Chargers, who can knock off the Broncos in Week 18 by winning against the Texans on Saturday before facing Denver in their final regular-season game. \nThis game features two of the hottest teams in the league with Houston earning victories in 10 of its last 12 games and Los Angeles winning seven of its last eight games. This game will come down to which offense can prevail against either the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense (the Texans, who are allowing 16.6 points per game) or the NFL's No. 8 scoring defense (the Chargers, who are allowing 20.1 points per game). Ravens (7-8) at Packers (9-5-1)The Baltimore Ravens have a tightrope-like path to the postseason: they can win the AFC North if they beat the Packers and Steelers, while the Steelers lose to the Cleveland Browns in Week 17. Meanwhile, the Green Bay Packers are sitting pretty, by comparison, just needing to win one more game or have the Detroit Lions lose one more game.Saturday night at Lambeau Field will be interesting because both squads have uncertainty about their quarterback situation. Both Lamar Jackson (back) and Jordan Love (concussion) exited their respective team's Week 16 game with injuries. Jackson didn't practice on Tuesday while both Love and his backup Malik Willis (right shoulder) practiced as limited participants. \nSundaySteelers (9-6) at Browns (3-12)The Pittsburgh Steelers can win the AFC North by beating the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, plain and simple. This matchup could lose some of its impact before kickoff because the Steelers can also clinch the division title if the Packers do former quarterback Aaron Rodgers a solid by beating the Ravens on Saturday night.Browns All-Pro edge rusher Myles Garrett can also clinch the NFL's all-time, single-season sacks record with his 23rd sack of 2025 against Rodgers on Sunday afternoon. Seahawks (12-3) at Panthers (8-7)The Carolina Panthers can clinch the NFC South title with a win over the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks, and a Tampa Bay Buccaneers loss against the Miami Dolphins. Carolina did already beat the then-No. 1 seed Los Angeles Rams earlier this season. The Seahawks' path to the NFC West crown and the conference's No. 1 overall seed is simple: win out against the Panthers and then against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 18. Plenty on the line in this Sam Darnold revenge game. \nJaguars (11-4) at Colts (8-7)The Jacksonville Jaguars have a somewhat plausible path to being the AFC's No. 1 seed: winning out against the Indianapolis Colts in Week 17 and the Tennessee Titans in Week 18 and both the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots losing just one of their remaining two games. Jacksonville can lock up the AFC South this week with a win and a Texans loss against the Chargers on Saturday night. The Colts, who have a 1.8% chance of making the playoffs per CBS' SportsLine model, need to win out against the Jaguars and Houston Texans and have the Texans lose against the Chargers in Week 17. Giants (2-13) at Raiders (2-13)The New York Giants and the Las Vegas Raiders currently possess the first and second overall picks in the 2026 NFL Draft, respectively. CBS' SportsLine model gives the Giants a 32.6% chance at securing the top pick and the Raiders a 27.6% shot at the first overall pick. \nThis matchup will also be historic: it's the first game in NFL history between teams both entering a matchup on nine-game losing streaks. The Tank Bowl is here, and it is glorious. Patriots (12-3) at Jets (3-12)The New England Patriots can win the AFC East in Week 17 with a victory over the New York Jets and a Buffalo Bills loss against the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. Both outcomes are quite plausible. The No. 1 seed in the AFC is also well within reach for the Patriots should they win out against the Jets and Miami Dolphins and the Denver Broncos lose against either the Chiefs in Week 17 or the Chargers in Week 18. Meanwhile, the Jets are in possession of the 2026 NFL Draft's fourth overall pick with a chance to climb higher up the board with two more losses to finish out the season. The top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft is still within reach. \nEagles (10-5) at Bills (11-4)The Philadelphia Eagles are fighting for playoff seeding only, having already won the NFC East, but the highest they can climb is likely the No. 2 seed. The Buffalo Bills need to win out and have the Patriots lose one more game in order to win the AFC East for a sixth year in a row. A battle between two preseason Super Bowl favorites will be quite the treat.Bears (11-4) at 49ers (11-4)Both the Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers have the top seed in the NFC in their sights. The Bears have an 11% chance, according to CBS' SportsLine model, to pull it off with a win at the 49ers on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 17  before closing out the regular season at home against the Detroit Lions with another victory along with the Seattle Seahawks losing a game. The 49ers possess a 25% chance, according to CBS' SportsLine model, to finish atop the NFC with a Week 17 win against the Bears before concluding the regular season with a win against the Seattle Seahawks. If the 49ers can grab the No. 1 seed, they won't have to leave Levi's Stadium again starting in Week 17 since the site of Super Bowl LX is their home in Santa Clara. No game is more impactful in Week 17 than \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe've reached Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season, and it's a wild one that begins with a three-game slate on Thursday before two games on Saturday, 10 on Sunday and one on Monday. There are playoff berths, division titles, playoff seeding and draft positioning all at stake in what figures to be a very crucial week of football. But what does that mean for bettors? NFL betting expert Jeff Hochman has put together two three-leg money line parlays for Week 17, with one consisting solely of favorites, and the other of three underdogs. NFL three-team favorite money line parlay benefitsBetting heavy favorites can be a solid strategy if you want to bet on a three-team NFL money line parlay. This approach focuses on teams with odds of -150 or better, which means you lean toward high-probability outcomes. By pairing three teams that usually have odds between -150 and -350 or even higher, you're not only aiming for consistent, modest returns, but you're also stacking the deck in your favor for a higher chance of winning. Remember that you can still parlay a favorite with odds of -140 or less to avoid laying 2.5 points, which can significantly impact your chances of winning. Remember, you have to win all three legs for a successful wager.NFL money line favorites at -115 or shorter posted a 68% win percentage in 2023 and a 66.5% rate in 2022. Over the six-season period from 2018-24, NFL money line favorites maintained a 66.6% win rate (1,013-508-7). The strength of favorites correlates directly with their odds. In sports betting, if you see teams with odds between -150 and -200, they generally have a solid chance of winning with around a 60-65% success rate. Teams that are even bigger favorites with odds from -250 to -400 tend to be more reliable, showing win rates of about 70% to 80%. The 2024 NFL season stood out for favorites, with an overall win rate hitting 71.8%.Week 16 was a wild ride for NFL betting favorites -- they went 10-6 but dropped the ball in some big games. On the season, favorites are winning at a solid clip (162 out of 239, or 67.7%), but that's still a step behind last year's 71.8%. Now, with Week 17 on deck, the real question is: will favorites get their groove back, or are we about to see the underdogs steal the spotlight? With playoff spots up for grabs, you can bet motivation will be front and center these last two weeks. Check out Jeff's top money line parlays featuring both favorites and underdogs.  Week 17 NFL money line favorites parlay\nGreen Bay Packers over Baltimore Ravens\nWith Lamar Jackson and Jordan Love both sidelined by injuries last week, it looks like both teams will be relying on their backup quarterbacks. I trust Malik Willis's playmaking ability -- especially his mobility -- much more than Tyler Huntley, whose passing options are pretty limited. Meanwhile, Green Bay returns home after dropping two straight, hoping to finish strong in their final home game of the regular season.Baltimore will turn to the running game led by Derrick Henry. The Packers' run defense has systematically answered this challenge. Against Chicago's dual-threat attack featuring D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, Green Bay held both backs to 108 yards on 22 carries, with the longest run limited to 13 yards. The Packers rank 10th in rushing yards allowed per game (103.8), and their interior defensive line has proven capable of occupying the space created by Baltimore's 341-pound Travis Jones and John Jenkins.This matchup sets up well for the Packers at home. Baltimore's pass defense has struggled all season, ranking near the bottom of the league in yards allowed. The Ravens also don't generate much pressure up front or maintain tight coverage on the back end -- two key weaknesses against a well-coached passing attack. Even with a backup quarterback, Green Bay's offense under Matt LaFleur is one of the league's most efficient and should be able to take advantage.The Packers can clinch a playoff berth with a win, eliminating pressure while playing with playoff-round intensity. The Ravens face mathematical elimination -- a loss to Green Bay ends their season immediately, while even a win requires the Browns to defeat the Steelers on Sunday to keep playoff hopes alive.Buffalo Bills over Philadelphia Eagles\nThe Buffalo Bills secured a playoff spot thanks to the Colts' loss on Monday Night Football, but the AFC East race isn't over yet. Even if the Patriots handle the Jets in Sunday's early game, the Bills' shot at the division title is still alive. Josh Allen will be super motivated in this spot, and the Eagles could rest several starters since they won't secure the No. 1 seed and the NFC East division title is locked up.Buffalo has won four consecutive games (victories over Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, New England and Cleveland), while Philadelphia has managed just one win in its last four contests (29-18 over Washington in Week 16), with losses to the Chargers (19-22 in overtime), Bears (15-24) and Cowboys (21-24 after squandering a 21–0 halftime lead). Here's a stat that says it all: Since Lane Johnson joined the Eagles in 2013, they've gone 120-62-1 when he's in the lineup. Without him? Philadelphia is just 15-27, including 1-4 this season. That's a difference of 65 wins, which really shows how important Johnson is to this team.San Francisco 49ers over Chicago Bears\nThe Chicago Bears find themselves in the middle of a divisional gauntlet -- fresh off a win against the Packers and now looking ahead to a showdown with the Lions in Week 18. San Francisco is clinging to its NFC West title hopes and knows that every win down the stretch is crucial.This matchup features a classic strength-on-strength battle: the Bears boast the league's second-best rushing attack (151.7 yards per game, 4.9 yards per carry), while the 49ers counter with the NFL's eighth-ranked run defense (allowing just 102.9 yards per game). This game also spotlights two quarterbacks with proven track records in clutch moments this season.Brock Purdy has entered an elite performance window precisely when the 49ers require it most. His 75.8 QBR would be a career high if he qualified. Over his last two games -- decisive victories against Tennessee and Indianapolis --Purdy has completed 75% of his passes for 590 yards, eight touchdowns and just one interception while posting a 136.1 QB rating. Caleb Williams has thrown for 3,400 yards with a 23/6 TD/INT ratio, but his QBR is lagging behind at 56.7 (17th). I like the 49ers to make it six wins in a row.NFL three-team underdog money line parlay benefitsA very popular option is available if you're willing to take on a bit more risk for a potentially higher reward. Underdog money line parlays offer the largest possible payouts in the NFL betting landscape. Combining three underdogs with odds like +200, +150, and +300 could result in payouts exceeding 20-to-1 or higher. The best part is that, due to the high payouts, underdog parlays can still be profitable even when winning only a small percentage of bets. For example, hitting just one of several large underdog parlays could offset multiple losses and generate overall profit. NFL underdogs have historically outperformed expectations in specific situations, with home underdogs of +2 to +3 winning outright 46-48% of the time.Week 17 NFL money line underdog parlay\nCleveland Browns over Pittsburgh Steelers\nBacking the Browns here feels like a free roll. If the Ravens fall to the Packers on Saturday, the Steelers will have already clinched the division and could rest starters, leaving them with little motivation. If the Ravens win, the Browns will treat this game like their Super Bowl, relishing the chance to spoil a division rival's season. Cleveland's defense and overall metrics are much stronger at home, and the Steelers are banged up -- not to mention they'll be without suspended receiver DK Metcalf.Since 2021, the Steelers are 3-9 in games in which T.J. Watt does not play (including the postseason). Additionally, Pittsburgh is projected to finish as the No. 4 seed regardless of Sunday's outcome, meaning a loss does not materially damage its postseason probability. Teams that have already secured a playoff berth frequently experience motivational letdown against weak opponents, particularly on the road.All eyes will be on Myles Garrett, who's just one sack away from setting a new NFL single-season record. That pursuit is sure to crank up his energy and focus for this matchup. While chasing records can sometimes backfire, the game script favors him -- Cleveland's defense is likely to attack from the opening snap, giving Garrett the best possible shot at making history in front of the home fans.Cleveland has been a force at home since 2023, going 26-16 compared to just 14-26 on the road. With strong winds expected (15-25 MPH), home-field advantage could matter even more. This shapes up as a prime opportunity for the Browns to give their fans one last win before next season.Tennessee Titans over New Orleans Saints\nNew Orleans has been skating by with some luck and a few illusions, and they don't deserve to be such heavy favorites here. The Saints' current three-game winning streak (over the Panthers, Buccaneers and Jets) came against teams with a combined 10-23 record. Dome teams playing outdoor road games in the last two weeks of the regular season have always been a terrific spot to fade.The Titans' defense has quietly turned into one of the league's toughest run-stopping units, ranking top three in the NFL at shutting down rushing plays over the last month. That's bad news for a Saints offense still searching for its identity -- a tough challenge just got even tougher. Alvin Kamara is still out with knee and ankle injuries, so the Saints are missing their best playmaker. And if that wasn't enough, they've also lost backup Devin Neal to injured reserve, which leaves their backfield even thinner than before. In Kamara's absence, New Orleans has leaned hard on Taysom Hill's versatility, but the Titans' front seven -- anchored by Jeffery Simmons -- has the size and athleticism to stack the box and shut down Hill's power runs.I'm happy to back Cam Ward and the Titans, especially after their impressive win over the Chiefs. Ward has built strong chemistry with TE Chig Okonkwo and WR Chimere Dike, attacking the middle of the field with confidence. His knack for keeping plays alive with his legs will be crucial against a Saints pass rush that could be without key contributor Bryan Bresee, who is dealing with a knee injury.While a lot of people might expect a letdown from Tennessee, I think they'll rise to the occasion in their final home game of the season. Fading dome teams on the road -- especially when they have to play outdoors in the final two weeks of the regular season -- has consistently been a winning strategy.Atlanta Falcons over Los Angeles Rams \nThe Rams are coming off a devastating overtime loss to the Seahawks last Thursday. That game was essentially the NFC West Championship. Technically, the Rams are not mathematically eliminated from the NFC West title, but they are in a precarious position that could turn \"hopeless\" by kickoff. Since this is a Monday Night Football game, the Rams will head in already knowing whether the Seahawks took care of business against the Panthers on Sunday.Even if mathematically alive, the Rams are dealing with the emotional fallout of last week. Losing 38-37 to their arch-rival Seahawks -- in a game that would have effectively clinched the division -- is the type of gut-punch that causes flat performances the following week. This is a classic \"letdown spot\" despite the mini-bye.The Rams' offense truly clicks when all their playmakers are healthy, and WR Davante Adams' presence has been a game-changer. But with Adams unlikely to suit up, the Falcons' defense can focus on shutting down WR Puka Nacua, making life much tougher for QB Matthew Stafford. To make matters worse, starting guard Kevin Dotson's status is up in the air, and a banged-up interior offensive line is the last thing you want against Atlanta's surging defensive front. Kirk Cousins and the feisty Falcons offer great value at this price. Since taking over, he's been steady and accurate, connecting on 62% of his throws.Look for Atlanta to lean on Bijan Robinson to dictate the pace and limit the Rams' opportunities. If Robinson finds his rhythm early, the Falcons can keep Los Angeles on the sidelines and control how this game unfolds. Historically, when home teams on Monday Night Football are getting less than 10% of the bets and money, it often sets up a prime contrarian opportunity.\n            ",

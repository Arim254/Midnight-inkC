    "body": "\n        While every manager has their Week 13 Fantasy football picks that are must-starts, there are also Fantasy streamers you have to consider. Jacoby Brissett is coming off a 300-yard game and has been one of the most productive quarterbacks over the last six weeks. Meanwhile, the likes of Tyrone Tracy Jr., Kenneth Gainwell, Khalil Shakir, Michael Wilson and Hunter Henry all had 100-plus scrimmage yards last week. Your Week 13 Fantasy football strategy has to decipher if these were one-off performances or if any of the aforementioned are deserving to be in your Week 13 Fantasy football lineups.In the case of Brissett, the journeyman has clearly been more than a one-week wonder as he has at least 337 total yards or multiple touchdowns in six straight. On Sunday, he and Arizona will face Tampa, which allowed Josh Allen and Matthew Stafford to absolutely shred it over the last two games. Where do the Week 13 Fantasy football projections rank Brissett in comparison to QBs potentially returning from injury like Aaron Rodgers, C.J. Stroud and Jaxson Dart? Before making your Week 13 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 13 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 13 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 13 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 13 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 13: The model is fading Steelers WR D.K. Metcalf, a three-time 1,000-yard receiver who is the WR17 entering Week 13, may not warrant a spot in Week 13 Fantasy football lineups. The wideout scored a rushing touchdown last week, as Pittsburgh had to manufacture touches for him as the passing game, alone, isn't helping much in that regard. Metcalf has had 55 or fewer receiving yards in each of the last six weeks, with just one receiving score. Now he has to face Buffalo's No. 1 passing defense on Sunday, as the Bills are giving up just 169.4 passing yards over their last five games. Metcalf isn't among the top 24 wideouts in the Week 13 Fantasy football rankings, putting him outside of the WR2 radar in most-sized leagues.Another curveball: The model is high on Texans running back Woody Marks, who is the RB29 in standard leagues and the RB30 in PPR scoring. The rookie has supplanted veteran Nick Chubb as Houston's top back, with six straight games with double-digit carries. Marks is averaging 62.8 scrimmage yards with two scores over his last half-dozen contests, despite facing stacked boxes in the last three of those with Davis Mills under center. The Texans will face the Colts on Sunday, who just allowed Kareem Hunt to have 130 scrimmage yards last week and have given up five touchdowns to running backs over the last three games. Marks is a top-20 Fantasy RB in Week 13, per the model, slotting ahead of Breece Hall and Kenneth Walker III.

This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 13 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising wide receiver could lead you to victory?

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule is arguably the most anticipated to date and not just because of the three Thanksgiving Day games and the Black Friday contest. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 6.5-point road favorites on Sunday night. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-2.5) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 13 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:Top Week 13 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 13 NFL picks is that the Falcons (-2.5, 39.5) cover at the New York Jets in a Sunday 1 p.m. ET kickoff. Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6.5, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 13 features a 16-game slate, including a number of key divisional matchups. Among the biggest is when the Green Bay Packers battle the Detroit Lions in an NFC North matchup on Thanksgiving Day. That will pit two of the conference's best quarterbacks in Jordan Love of the Packers against Jared Goff of the Lions. In an important AFC South battle, the Houston Texans look to pull within one game of the division lead when they meet the Indianapolis Colts. The Lions are -2.5, while the Colts are favored by 4.5 points as C.J. Stroud (concussion) is hoping to be cleared to play.A non-divisional matchup with heavy AFC playoff race implications will be played on Sunday afternoon when Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills take on Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Buffalo has won four of the past five meetings, with the Bills pulling out a 31-17 win in the last meeting on Jan. 15, 2024.

    "body": "\n        The NFL Thanksgiving Day games are often as anticipated as the food and family time which accompany the holiday, and the 2025 Thanksgiving NFL slate is among the best ever. Lions vs. Packers (+2.5) kicks things off at 1 p.m. ET, followed by Cowboys vs. Chiefs (-3) at 4:30 p.m. ET, with Ravens vs. Bengals (+7) the 8:20 p.m. ET nightcap. One could make an NFL parlay using those spreads, or incorporate picks on the total, with the money line, or by inserting NFL props. Baltimore enters in on a five-game winning streak this season, and it's won four straight versus Cincinnati, making the Ravens an attractive option with your Thanksgiving NFL parlay.As for those prop bets you could include, there is no shortage of stars to target, including Jahmyr Gibbs, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Dak Prescott and a well-rested Ja'Marr Chase. Prescott has multiple touchdown passes in five straight Thanksgiving Day games, but Kansas City has given up just 11 passing scores across 11 games this year. He has an over/under of 1.5 passing TDs versus the Chiefs, with NFL prop odds of -132 for the Over and an intriguing plus-money payout of +100 for the Under.

Not only has Baltimore won four straight versus Cincy, but the Ravens sport a 4-1 ATS record over their last five meetings. This season, Baltimore's defense is back to being elite as it has kept six straight opponents under 20 points, including a pair of top-10 scoring offenses in the Rams and Bears. Even if Joe Burrow returns, the Bengals offense isn't on that level, and Cincinnati's defense is the worst in the NFL.The Bengals rank dead last in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense, while working second-to-last in run defense and third-down defense. A lack of taking the ball away plays a big part in those rankings as Cincy has forced only one turnover, total, over its last four games, while Baltimore has nine takeaways over its last four. With these discrepancies, Baltimore is projected to win by double-digits and cover in well over 50% of simulations in an A-rated spread pick. See which other NFL parlay picks to make here, and bet the Ravens to cover here:How to make Thanksgiving NFL parlaysThe model also jumped on three other NFL picks, including a player prop that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Thanksgiving NFL best bets and NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NFL picks, and which Thanksgiving Day NFL bets should you target for an epic 11-1 payout?

    "body": "\n        Having teams that annually play on Thanksgiving like the Lions and Cowboys, as well as teams that make rare appearances, gives you several options with NFL DFS picks and a daily Fantasy football strategy. You could roster those with proven success on the holiday, like Jahmyr Gibbs, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb. Or, you could heed the NFL DFS advice of picking those looking to put on a show on, possibly, their only career Turkey Day appearances. Amongst first timers to the NFL Thanksgiving Day tradition are Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Ja'Marr Chase.Joe Burrow is another in the Thanksgiving NFL DFS player pool who will make his debut on the holiday, in addition to suiting up for the first time since Week 2. Even though he's been oft-injured, this is the first time Burrow will be returning in-season from an injury. You wonder if that will have an effect on what he can provide to NFL DFS lineups as Cincy, essentially, has to run the table. Before making any NFL DFS picks for Thanksgiving, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Thanksgiving NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Thanksgiving DayPart of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for Thanksgiving is rostering Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce at $5,000 on DraftKings and $6,000 on FanDuel. The 10-time Pro Bowler is having a resurgent season as he's on pace for his first 1,000-yard season since 2022 and is averaging his most yards per catch since 2020. Kelce has at least 73 receiving yards and a touchdown in each of his last two games versus Dallas, and the Cowboys have struggled defending tight ends this year. Just seven teams allow more receptions per game to the position than Dallas, which has seen opposing tight ends average 7.3 catches for 72.7 yards, with one total touchdown, over the last three games. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Bengals running back Chase Brown ($7,200 on FanDuel, $6,500 on DraftKings), who has increased his scrimmage yards in each of the last six games, with 130 yards last week. Brown has ranked 11th amongst running backs in Fantasy points over this stretch and has five straight games with at least 100 total yards. Brown averaged 74 scrimmage yards with one total touchdown in his two games versus Baltimore's No. 1 run defense last year, and the Ravens are just 20th versus the run this season. Burrow's expected return should only help Brown, as he should see fewer stacked boxes with a more threatening passing attack. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set Thanksgiving Day NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Thanksgiving.

    "body": "\n        Teams on opposite sides of the AFC North standings meet as part of the 2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule when the Baltimore Ravens host the Cincinnati Bengals in the nightcap. The Ravens are tied atop the division with the Steelers, and currently hold the tiebreaker. Cincinnati, meanwhile, is tied with the Browns at the bottom of the division, but the Bengals will have receiver Ja'Marr Chase back from suspension and expect to have quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) back in the lineup. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Baltimore. Baltimore is a 7-point favorite in the Bengals vs. Ravens odds, while the over/under is 52.

They're 3-2 against the spread during that span, but just missed two covers that would've put them on a 5-0 ATS run. Jackson's improved health has certainly been a factor in the run, but the defense is also playing much better. Since an embarrassing 44-10 loss to the Texans on Oct. 5, no team has cleared 20 points against Baltimore. The Bengals are getting healthier, but won't have Tee Higgins (concussion) for this one. Burrow being sharp after such a long layoff isn't a foregone conclusions either, so Baltimore has a clear path to a win and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Bengals can coverLikely having Burrow back under center certainly makes this a much more competitive matchup. Cincinnati didn't blink against the powerful Patriots in Week 12 either, losing 26-20 and staying within the 7.5-point spread. Now the Bengals get their two-time Pro Bowl quarterback under center, along with Chase back in the lineup following last week's suspension. Baltimore's offense scored just 23 points in each of the past two weeks against two of the league's worst teams -- the Browns and Jets -- giving Cincinnati a chance to keep this game competitive and within the number. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Ravens vs. Bengals picksFor Bengals vs. Ravens on Thanksgiving, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 54 combined points.

From Ohio State vs. Michigan (+10) to Alabama vs. Auburn (+6) to Virginia vs. Virginia Tech (+9.5), many may place Week 14 college football bets with their hearts as much as their heads. Not only can you make picks on those conference matchups, but a number of non-conference contests could factor into your college football betting strategy. South Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite over Clemson, per the latest Week 14 college football odds, in an SEC vs. ACC battle.Others of that ilk include Florida vs. Florida State (+1.5) and Kentucky vs. Louisville (-3). Meanwhile, no team has performed better in college football picks against the spread than Texas Tech, which is 10-1 versus the line. The Red Raiders are 23.5-point favorites over West Virginia as the former seeks a win to secure its first-ever trip to the Big 12 Championship Game.

The Gators have been much more competitive since firing Billy Napier as the team has as many ATS wins (two) in four games under interim Billy Gonzales as it had in seven games under Napier. Florida won last year's matchup -- by 20 points on the road -- and it hosting this year's contest gives it a massive advantage. The Seminoles have not won or covered in an away stadium since 2023 as they are 0-8 both straight-up and against the spread over that run. In addition to Florida covering, the model forecasts the Under to hit in well over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Virginia Tech (+9.5, 52.5) covers on the road versus No. 17 Virginia at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. It's impossible to ignore the outright dominance of the Hokies over their in-state rival in this series, as Virginia Tech has won 19 of its last 20 games versus Virginia Tech. The last few matchups haven't even been close, as Virginia Tech won by 20 points at home last year and prevailed by 38 points the last time UVA hosted in 2023. This year, the Hokies have played much better under interim coach, Philip Montgomery, as they've both outright won and covered three times under him, compared to being winless both straight up and ATS under former coach Brent Fry. UVA has dropped two straight at home ATS as the model forecasts this as a one-score game. The model projects the Hokies to cover nearly 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 14The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 14, and it's identified several A-rated picks involving major games. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you jump on?

But the honor to see who gets to face the star before his retirement must be earned, and so WWE superstars are currently battling in The Last Time is Now Tournament, with the winner ultimately becoming Cena's final opponent in Washington, D.C.The Last Time is Now Tournament competition began on the Nov. 10 episode of Monday Night Raw and will continue on the two weekly main roster shows, leading into the fifth and final Saturday Night's Main Event of 2025.Superstars from every rung of the WWE ladder are competing for the unique opportunity to show Cena the door. The 16-man field includes both day-to-day superstars from Raw and SmackDown, popular NXT wrestlers like Je'Von Evans, and classic rivals like The Miz.Two surprise entrants from Cena's past also competed in the tournament. Zack Ryder returned for a one-off match on SmackDown, and Dolph Ziggler received a warm ovation for his match on Raw.\nRusev and Sheamus, each with a longstanding history of fighting Cena, were the first to advance to the quarterfinals. However, Sheamus pulled out before the quarterfinals with a shoulder injury. Jey Uso overcame The Miz, while LA Knight spoiled Ryder's WWE return to advance. Now, the quarterfinals are underway with some interesting matchups. On SmackDown, Rusev will face Jey Uso, while LA Knight awaits Sheamus' replacement. A returning GUNTHER and Solo Sikoa progressed through two rounds and will meet in the semifinals.  \nTake a look below at the tournament schedule, results, and upcoming match dates.

Mike Tomlin anticipates that last Sunday will be the only start Rodgers misses due to the injury. The Steelers coach told reporters Tuesday that they intend for him to start for Sunday's showdown against Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills.\"We'll start this week with great optimism although we certainly will limit him at the early portions of the week, provide opportunities for the other quarterbacks while preserving him,\" Tomlin said. \"But again, we're comfortable with the general trajectory, but I'll keep you updated in his level of participation and the quality of his participation over the course of the week will be the greatest indicator.\"Tomlin told CBS Sports' Evan Washburn shortly before kickoff Sunday that Rodgers did everything he could to put himself in position to start after suffering the injury during the Week 11 victory against the Cincinnati Bengals, but it was the \"prudent play\" to start Mason Rudolph. \n\"He fought his tail off all week, but that's the prudent play for us to make as a collective,\" Tomlin said on NFL Today+. \"He won't be playing this week. We'll let Mason start, and obviously, he's absorbed most of the reps this week.\" Rudolph completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception in his first start of the season. The Steelers out-gained the Bears 345 yards to 328, but 186 of Pittsburgh's total yards came on the ground.\nWhen it comes to Rodgers' potential return to the lineup, the wrist issue is not so much about pain tolerance as it is the ability for the veteran signal-caller to protect himself. The Steelers, now at 6-5, blew a 3.5-game lead in the AFC North to the Baltimore Ravens, who also sit at 6-5. Lamar Jackson and company host the Bengals on Thanksgiving night. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Red Sox have beefed up their starting rotation with a Thanksgiving week trade. They have acquired right-hander Sonny Gray from the Cardinals, the teams announced Tuesday.Headed back to the Cardinals are left-handed pitcher Brandon Clarke and right-handed pitcher Richard Fitts.Gray, 36, was set to make $35 million in 2026 before a $30 million team option for 2027 with a $5 million buyout. His contract was reworked as part of this deal, and he'll now get $31 million for 2026 and a mutual option that has a $10 million buyout for 2027, per The Athletic. The Red Sox will also receive $20 million from St. Louis to help defray Gray's salary, leaving Boston's total hit at about $21 million, CBS Sports has confirmed.The Cardinals are going through a bit of a rebuild here, shedding dollars where they can and opening up space for younger players, while the Red Sox were looking for rotation help, so there was a good match on this deal. \nIn 32 starts last season, Gray was 14-8 with a 4.28 ERA, 1.23 WHIP and 201 strikeouts against 38 walks in 180 ⅔ innings. He was worth 1.4 WAR. He finished second in Cy Young voting with the Twins in 2023, but it's fair to say his two years with the Cardinals were slightly disappointing. He's still got the swing-and-miss stuff, though, so it's possible he is good for the 2026 Red Sox. Gray had a no-trade clause, but he said late in the season he was open to waiving it.\"I think I do (have to consider waiving it), just to be frank and to be honest,\" he said. \"I definitely think I do. Whether I do decide that I want to go somewhere – whether that actually happens – I don't have complete control of that. Obviously, I have control of where I can't go or don't go. I'm going to be 36. It's going to be my 14th season. Last year of my contract for this. I don't know what the future holds for me.\"\nThe Red Sox's ace is Garrett Crochet, who is coming off a runner-up in the Cy Young vote. We can probably slot Gray second before Brayan Bello, Connelly Early and Kutter Crawford, at least to start the season.The Red Sox made the playoffs last year for the first time since 2021 and lost in the Wild Card Series to the Yankees, two games to one. The Cardinals finished 78-84 and have missed the playoffs three straight seasons. In addition to Gray, the expectation is they'll try to trade third baseman Nolan Arenado (as they have been doing for at least a year) and maybe even converted first baseman Willson Contreras. Utility man Brendan Donovan has also been rumored to be available. The Cardinals are looking to go younger and shed money here in the short term. They've transitioned in the front office from long-time president John Mozeliak to Chaim Bloom. \nClarke is a 22-year-old pitcher who had a 5.08 ERA in 11 starts in High-A last season. He also made three starts in Class A and pitched to 0.93 ERA with 17 strikeouts in 9 ⅔ innings. Fitts, 25, has made 15 appearances in the majors. He's 2-5 with a 3.97 ERA, 1.29 WHIP and 49 strikeouts in 65 ⅔ innings. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With no shortage of three pound-for-pound ranked fighters featured in title bouts, November's \"Ring IV\" pay-per-view event in Saudi Arabia showcased some of the most skilled and exciting boxers that the sport has to offer. None were as impressive and singularly dominant, however, as the 25-year-old virtuoso known as Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez. On the same night that David Benavidez made the first defense of his full light heavyweight title and Devin Haney outpointed the most dangerous welterweight to become a three-division champion, Rodriguez's performance in unifying 115-pound titles for the second straight bout shined just that much brighter. Rodriguez (23-0, 16 KOs) was expected to be challenged in his showdown with fellow unbeaten champion Fernando \"Puma\" Martinez, the awkward and aggressive Argentine who has stood tall atop the 115-pound division for three years. But like he has routinely done throughout his incredible eight-year run as a pro, Rodriguez made it look like his decorated opponent didn't belong in the same ring with him. \nThis wasn't just a showcase of the elegant footwork and sublime boxing skills that Rodriguez brings to the table. \"Bam\" also brought the boom in Round 10 when the southpaw deftly slipped a jab and countered with a left cross that dropped Martinez and left him unable to beat the count. \nAfter the fight, the soft-spoken and humble Rodriguez said that he hopes his skills and accomplishments will now gain him recognition on the same level as the three all-time greats who have flipflopped places of late atop the P4P rankings: Terence Crawford, Oleksandr Usyk and Naoya Inoue. From the standpoint of this writer, it's a space Rodriguez belongs in. Whether it's Srisaket Sor Rungvisai, Sunny Edwards, Juan Francisco Estrada or Martinez, when Rodriguez steps up to the highest level against the best fighters his divisions have to offer, he runs right through them in a systematic fashion that is both beautiful to behold and brutal to be on the wrong end of. \nEven in a crowded group of future Hall of Famers atop the P4P rankings, Rodriguez has shown that he's something rare, unique and undoubtedly special. And he's still only 25.Pound-for-Pound Rankings1. Terence CrawfordUndisputed super middleweight champion (42-0, 31 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 1In a historic victory that only further cemented Crawford as one of the greatest boxers of this century (if not all-time), the junior middleweight titleholder moved up two divisions to outbox and, at times, outmuscle Canelo Alvarez in their September superfight. Crawford fought southpaw the whole way and became the first male boxer of the four-belt era to become undisputed champion in three weight divisions. A rematch could be in order for 2026. 2. Oleksandr UsykUndisputed heavyweight champion (24-0, 15 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 1Usyk's professional run has been as decorated as it has been perfect. The former undisputed cruiserweight champ reached a similar status at heavyweight for the second time in July when he brutally knocked out Daniel Dubois in their rematch. Usyk has accomplished more as a pro through 24 fights than anyone else in history and now, in just eight appearances at heavyweight, the 38-year-old owns two wins apiece over Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua and Dubois.\n3. Naoya InoueUndisputed junior featherweight champion (28-0, 25 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 3The four-division champion recorded his third victory of 2025 when he widely outpointed former unified champion Murdjon Akhmadaliev in September. \"The Monster\" is set to close the year by defending his titles in December against mandatory challenger David Picasso in Saudi Arabia. A showdown with recently vacated bantamweight champion and fellow countryman Junto Nakatani could also be on tap for early 2026. \n4. Jesse \"Bam\" RodriguezUnified junior bantamweight champion (22-0, 15 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 5The 25-year-old phenom from San Antonio continues to build his case for inclusion in the argument of best fighter in the world. Rodriguez showcased everything that makes him special in a July dismantling of unbeaten Phumelala Cafu to unify titles at 115 pounds. He returned in November to further unify belts when he outclassed and stopped unbeaten Fernando \"Puma\" Martinez in Saudi Arabia. \n5. Dmitry BivolUndisputed light heavyweight champion (24-1, 12 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 4Despite coming up just short against Artur Beterbiev via majority decision in their 2024 undisputed clash, Bivol turned the tables four months later in their February rematch. Saying he needed to simply \"do more,\" Bivol did just that by rallying in the second half and holding off Beterbiev in Round 12. A trilogy fight in 2026 could be next for the future Hall of Famer. \n6. David BenavidezLight heavyweight titleholder (31-0, 25 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 7Frustrated with waiting around forCanelo Alvarez, \"El Monstro\" moved up to light heavyweight in 2024 to begin a string of impressive victories against former champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk and unbeaten David Morrell Jr. in January. After being upgraded to full WBC titleholder, Benavidez made his debut in Saudi Arabia in November when he stopped Anthony Yarde. A shot at unified cruiserweight champion Gilberto \"Zurdo\" Ramirez appears next for May 2026 in Las Vegas. 7. Artur BeterbievLight heavyweight (21-1, 20 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 6Four months after narrowly defeating Dmitry Bivol to become the first four-belt undisputed champion in 175-pound history, Beterbiev came up just short in their February rematch via majority decision. At 40, Beterbiev is still chasing big fights for 2026, whether that comes in the form of a Bivol trilogy or a showdown against titleholder David Benavidez. \n8. Shakur StevensonWBC lightweight champion (24-0, 11 KOs) | Previous ranking: 8After two years of criticism and performances deemed as boring, Stevenson showed what he's truly capable of in an exciting July win over unbeaten mandatory challenger William Zepeda. Stevenson was more willing than normal to stand in the line of fire in order to land his own combinations on the inside. Stevenson is expected to move up to 140 pounds in early 2026 in a long-rumored bout against titleholder Teofimo Lopez Jr.9. Junto NakataniJunior featherweight (30-0, 23 KOs) | Previous ranking: 10A two-division titleholder, the native of Japan has become a breakout star after a recent title run of big knockouts at 118 pounds. Nakatani closed 2025 by choosing to vacate his bantamweight title, however, with plans to move up to 122 pounds in hopes of landing a much-anticipated fight against countryman Naoya Inoue.10. Devin HaneyWelterweight titleholder (33-0, 15 KOs) | Previous ranking: NRFor all of the criticism he absorbed over his last two fights, Haney reminded everyone of his P4P talent and ring IQ in November when he dropped and handled unbeaten WBO welterweight titleholder Brian Norman Jr. to become a three-division champion. Haney looked stronger and more sturdy at 147 pounds after years of difficult weight cuts. A high-profile unification rematch with Ryan Garcia, who will fight for a welterweight title in January, could be one of the biggest fights boxing produces in 2026. \nDropped out: Canelo AlvarezHonorable mention: Alvarez, Teofimo Lopez Jr., Gervonta Davis, Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis, Keyshawn Davis\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Ravens have already turned around their season. On Thanksgiving, Joe Burrow hopes to do the same for the Bengals. Burrow returns from a turf toe injury suffered in Week 2 as the Bengals visit Baltimore as the finale of a Thanksgiving triple-header.The Bengals, who started 2-0, have fallen to 3-8 on the season, with Jake Browning and Joe Flacco both earning starts in Burrow's stead. Though a late-season rally seems unlikely, the Bengals do have the good fortune of playing in a down AFC North, where the Ravens and the Steelers are tied atop the standings at just 6-5. Even with Burrow back and Ja'Marr Chase returning from a one-game suspension, the Cincinnati offense won't be whole, as Tee Higgins (concussion). On the other side of the ball, ace pass rusher Trey Hendrickson (hip/pelvis) is out as well.Baltimore has won five straight since a 1-5 start, and though the last four wins have come with Lamar Jackson back from a hamstring injury, the Ravens' offense is yet to take full flight. Jackson has been a reticent runner, and the Ravens are just 18th in yards per game over the past four weeks. Perhaps a matchup with a struggling Bengals defense is just what they need.\n        \n            \n                Ravens vs. Bengals prediction: Can Joe Burrow save Cincinnati on Thanksgiving?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are five bets to consider.Ravens best bets(All odds via FanDuel Sportsbook)Mark Andrews any time touchdown (+100) OR first touchdown scorer (+700)This season, the Bengals have allowed 76 receptions for 962 yards and 13 touchdowns to opposing tight ends. The 76 catches are tied for most in the NFL, but it's the latter two categories that prove Cincinnati's ineptitude defending the position: No other team has allowed more than 799 yards or seven touchdowns to tight ends.\nThat makes Andrews a strong candidate to find the end zone, if he wasn't one already. He has six touchdowns this season, including four in his last four games. Not only is he a receiving threat, but he has moonlighted as a short-yardage runner; that included a 35-yard touchdown run in Week 11.Hunter Henry just torched the Bengals for seven catches, 115 yards and a touchdown. If you're willing to get a bit more adventurous, tight ends have scored the first touchdown of the game against Cincinnati four times this season, making first touchdown scorer at +700 intriguing.Derrick Henry 100+ rushing yards (+128)Getting Henry to hit triple digits at plus money should be a good bit of business. Though it's been a down year for him overall, Henry has gone over the century mark in three of his last six games, and now he gets a Bengals defense that is allowing 156 rushing yards per game. The Bengals have been putrid tackling (116 missed tackles, tied for most in the NFL), and on a short week against one of the league's most physical backs, don't expect that to change.\nZay Flowers under 5.5 receptions AND under 65.5 receving yards (-101)There's a lot of things wrong with the Bengals' defense, but DJ Turner II isn't one of them. Only one player has more than two catches in a game with Turner as the primary defender this season. Only one player has had 50 yards in a game with Turner as the primary defender this year. Turner will likely guard Flowers, and Jackson will likely look elsewhere.Bengals best betsJa'Marr Chase over 110 receiving yards (+162)Last season, Chase recorded 457 receiving yards and five touchdowns against the Ravens, the 457 receiving yards a single-season record against a single opponent. In eight career games, Chase has 58 receptions for 962 receiving yards and eight touchdowns, and with Higgins sidelined, Chase should be in line for another busy day. The Ravens' defense has been much improved as of late, but Chase in particular represents an entire different challenge, as his history against Baltimore shows.Bengals to win AND under 51.5 points (+700)The price here is too good to pass up. The under is 14-10 this year on Thursdays, and Baltimore's red zone offense has been a mess, which also lends itself to the under hitting. The Bengals offense could get off to a slow start as Burrow makes his first appearance since Week 2, but it should pick up thereafter. Cincinnati has its back against the wall. Baltimore has been winning recently but has been sluggish. Maybe this is the week it catches up to them.\n            ",

The Dallas Cowboys play host to the Kansas City Chiefs on CBS in what has to be one of the most anticipated regular-season games in a long, long time, and we're not talking about just on Thanksgiving.This is a battle of America's teams, or perhaps America's most hated teams. Whether you love them or hate them, it's going to be hard to turn away on Thanksgiving. NFL past dynasty vs. present dynasty will clash in a critical game with a lot at stake and absolutely no shortage of star power. Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones, Andy Reid, Jerry Jones, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and more.Both teams are fighting for their playoff lives coming off historic comebacks. It's also a homecoming for Texas native Mahomes. Taylor Swift's fiancé will be playing. Post Malone will be performing at halftime. This game has something for everyone and I cannot wait.Bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:\nHere's everything you need to know to catch Chiefs-Cowboys on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:Where to watch Cowboys vs. Chiefs liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Dallas)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -3.5, O/U 52.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key storylinesCritical game in playoff hunt with both teams on outside looking in: No game has more at stake this week than the Cowboys and Chiefs. The Chiefs are 6-5 coming off the largest fourth-quarter comeback win of Mahomes' career (down 11 vs. Colts) and the Cowboys are 5-5-1 after matching the largest comeback win in team history (down 21 vs. 8-2 Eagles). Both are on the outside of the playoffs looking in right now as the No. 10 seeds in their respective conferences. There's work to do. The winner will enhance their playoff chances while a loss wouldn't quite burst anyone's playoff bubble, but would do a lot of damage, especially in Dallas' case. Kansas City has more at stake than any team in the league right now. The Chiefs have historic streaks in jeopardy, going for an 11th straight playoff appearance, eighth straight AFC title game and fourth straight Super Bowl this year.Chiefs taking over as America's team: This game is going to bring families together. They might be united in their hatred toward two of the NFL's most polarizing franchises, but at least they'll be in it together. You could call this a clash of the NFL's  \"evil empires,\" two accomplished franchises with giant targets on their backs. A matchup of two of the NFL's last three dynasties (sandwiching the 2001-19 Patriots in the middle). The Cowboys won three Super Bowls in the 90s (1992, 1993, 1995) and the Chiefs have won three since drafting Mahomes (2019, 2022, 2023). It's been well documented the Dallas Cowboys are \"America's Team\" but that torch has probably been passed to the Chiefs. Kansas City has made seven straight AFC title games, but Dallas hasn't made an NFC Championship since 1995, the longest active drought in the conference. Mahomes has more Super Bowl MVPs (three) than Prescott has playoff wins (two). A game with more cinema than anyone could imagine will fittingly be played at the NFL's greatest theater, Jerry World. Mahomes homecoming: It will also be a homecoming for Mahomes. He grew up a diehard Cowboys fan just 1.5 hours from Dallas in Tyler, Texas. Remarkably, this is Mahomes' first NFL start at AT&T Stadium. Be ready for a show though as he put up video game numbers in three games at Jerry World when he was at Texas Tech (all neutral site games vs. Baylor). Mahomes averaged over 500 passing yards and five touchdowns in three games at Jerry World, including a 586-yard, six-touchdown performance in the last game of his college career in 2016. Those are crazy numbers, even if it was on a team known for playing a lot of track meets.George Pickens can continue to feast: If Mahomes doesn't provide the fireworks, look to George Pickens, one of the best offseason additions in the entire NFL. He has the second-most receiving yards (1,054) in the NFL this season and the most ever in a player's first 11 games in a Cowboys uniform. He's quickly reaching star status, especially after the damage he did in the Cowboy's Week 12 comeback vs. the Eagles, racking up 133 yards after Dallas trailed 21-0. He's making a Terrell Owens or Randy Moss type impact and he's seemingly good for one 'You Got Moss'd' moment every game. I'm not saying he's going to have an impact like Moss infamously did at Dallas on Thanksgiving in 1998 (three catches, 163 yards, three touchdowns) but I wouldn't be surprised if he caught a deep ball or two. It won't be easy for Kansas City to take him away, either, with All-Pro Lamb on the other side.Cowboys defense can continue turnaround with Quinnen Williams: It would have been easy to write off the Cowboys' season a few weeks ago because of a slow start and horrible defense but Jerry Jones' bold move to trade a first- and second-round pick at the deadline for Quinnen Williams has immediately paid off. The long-term ramifications could be a different story but for now Dallas has won two straight games since Williams made his season debut and the defense has been a big reason why. The Cowboys dominated the trenches vs. the Raiders and Eagles, ranking among the league leaders in pressures (38, third) and rushing yards allowed (45.0 per game, second) in the last two weeks. Rookie first-round pick Ashton Jeanty couldn't get anything going vs. Dallas rejuvenated the line (six carries, 7 yards) and the same could be said of Saquon Barkley (10 carries, 22 yards). The Chiefs might not have a dynamic back, but Kareem Hunt has been lethal in short yardage situations and Mahomes is always a nightmare outside the pocket so Williams could have a huge impact again.You can bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Travis Kelce's first Thanksgiving game in the NFLFor all the star power on the field, one player might have the most off it. Kelce (and most of the Chiefs) will be playing in their first NFL game on Thanksgiving. Kelce may be slowing down at age 36, but he's still finding a way to be productive. He leads the Chiefs with 674 yards receiving this season and is on pace to become the oldest tight end in NFL history with 1,000 yards receiving in a season. He's never one to shy away from a big stage so expect him to be in the middle of all the action on Thursday. \nPost Malone performs the halftime showThis is a game for everyone. From casual to hardcore NFL fans, Swifties and entertainment enthusiasts. Lifelong Cowboys fan Post Malone will have you covered with the latter as he takes the stage at Jerry World during halftime. Malone has performed at NFL events and games before, including last Christmas when he joined Beyoncé for her halftime show in Houston.\"I'm from Texas. I grew up a Cowboys fan and have been watching this halftime show for years,\" Post Malone said. \"It's a real honor to be part of the Red Kettle Kickoff with The Salvation Army and the Dallas Cowboys and help bring hope to so many people.\"Post Malone has 18 Grammy nominations, 11 Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards and six MTV Video Music Awards. The \"Sunflower\" singer has explored many genres in his career, from rap to country to rock.\nPost Malone joins some elite company as Cowboys Thanksgiving Day performers, dating back to Reba McEntire taking the stage in 1997. Randy Travis, Destiny's Child, Sheryl Crow, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Enrique Inglesias, Selena Gomez and the Jonas Brothers are some other performers in the exclusive group.Prediction\nIt's been an up-and-down season for both teams which is why they are hovering right around .500. It's hard to know which version of each team is going to show up on Thursday, but I'm giving Dallas a slight edge. They play better at home (3-1-1 this season vs. 2-4 on road) while the Chiefs have struggled on the road (1-4). This will be a great test to see if the Cowboys' turnaround on defense is legitimate and they could have a leg up in the trenches with Chiefs Pro Bowl guard Trey Smith expected to miss time with an ankle injury. The Cowboys could suddenly be looking more complete on both sides of the ball so I'm taking them to pull off the upset at home in a close game. Pick: Cowboys 27, Chiefs 24 | Cowboys +3.5, Under 52.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nWe talked last week about the group of 10 teams at the top of our betting power ratings who had a claim to be No. 1, with all either unproven or flawed on some level and not much distance between No. 1 and No. 10. We may finally be getting some answers, especially with that top spot after a dominant performance by the Rams.My previous hesitancy with the Rams was a defense that had looked great in some plus matchups but struggled to slow down certain offenses while seeming to rely too much on bad decisions by opposing quarterbacks to create turnovers (the Bears have faced similar skepticism during their winning streak). I was wrong, or at least, those questions have been put to bed after a dominant performance against a good Buccaneers offense.After 12 weeks, the Rams have the MVP favorite on offense and the No. 1 scoring defense. That's enough to forego my usual slow adjustment period and move their rating up two points to be bar none on a tier by themselves.The Patriots are 10th out of 10 when it comes to the clear top teams in the league even though they're the only team with 10 wins. That's because we're not building our ratings in a way to assess performance over the course of the season, but rather where teams are right now, and I'm concerned the Patriots' offense is going to take a step back due to injuries up front. We only have to look to last year to see how ineffective Drake Maye could be when protection was an issue, and his spotty accuracy on Sunday could be a cause for alarm. I'm interested to see how that O-line holds up against the Giants front that can get after the quarterback, and that matchup has me thinking the spread for the game is too high.\nI'll have several more spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.Let's dive into our betting power ratings and highlight a few more teams of note.Week 13 power ratingsTeam131211109LAR7.55.55.554.5KC6.55.5777.5SEA65.55.554.5IND565.555DET55.565.56BUF4.55564.5PHI4.54.55.554.5BAL45555GB44455NE3.543.52.52.5DEN21010SF11-10-1HOU10100CHI10-1-1-1.5DAL10-1-1-1LAC0011.52JAC0-1-2-1.5-1PIT-1.5-1.5-100CIN-1.5-5.5-5-5-4.5NYG-2.5-3-3.5-3.5-3.5MIN-3-20-1-1.5ARI-3-2.5-2-1-1ATL-3-5-10-1TB-31111MIA-4-4-4.5-5-4.5CAR-4.5-3.5-4-3.5-4.5WAS-5.5-5.5-5.5-3.5-1CLE-5.5-5.5-5.5-5.5-5.5LV-6-5.5-4-3.5-3.5NO-6.5-5.5-5.5-6.5-5.5NYJ-7.5-9-7.5-6.5-6TEN-8.5   -9-8-8-8One week after appearing to have serious issues against a mediocre Broncos team, the Chiefs looked like world-beaters once again in a dominant performance against an elite Colts offense. Even though it took overtime to get the win, the Chiefs had the edge in first downs 33-10 and would've turned in a blowout victory if not for a fluke Patrick Mahomes interception that set the Colts up for a free touchdown early, and then the Chiefs' offense repeatedly stalled in the red zone (1 of 6 touchdown rate) and goal to go (0 for 3). The other AFC contenders need to find a way to keep the Chiefs out of the playoffs, as even at 6-5 they look like the most dangerous team in the conference.I have the Seahawks as the clear No. 3 team even though they didn't come close to covering in what was a bit of a fluky outcome once again, with the Titans securing a punt return TD but still sitting in a 30-10 hole late in the third quarter before tacking on two TDs. I had to dock the Lions after their struggles to put away the Giants in what's typically a great spot for the team coming off a loss, but we know at their best they could be up there with the Chiefs.Getting out of the top tier, I'm starting to believe in the Bears and Cowboys as above-average teams who could give most squads trouble in any given week, and that's going to be put to the test during the holiday season with Dallas hosting the Chiefs and Chicago hosting the Eagles. As long as they don't completely flop, I'll probably keep them at a +1 heading into the following week, and I'd expect either to play an even game against the Texans or the 49ers, who are barely in that +1 tier for me with Brock Purdy looking ineffective against the Panthers. San Francisco might be the team with the widest range of ratings that could be defensible at this moment.I'm moving the Bengals up four points with the return of Joe Burrow, which isn't all the way back to where I would put them with a healthy Burrow. If he does look healthy after the long layoff and if the Bengals get Tee Higgins and Trey Hendrickson back after Thanksgiving, there will be an argument to put the Bengals at dead even with the opportunity to get back into above-average territory where they were before the Burrow injury.My Buccaneers rating is accounting for Baker Mayfield missing this week after he was knocked out of last week's action with a shoulder injury that had him deemed doubtful to return rather than questionable. With the short week and reading into the severity of the injury on the day, I don't think they can risk throwing him out there, and I'm not confident in the offense without him, even if Bucky Irving returns. Teddy Bridgewater is a fine backup QB, but he doesn't have anywhere near the upside of Mayfield when healthy, so I think it's fair to place the Bucs alongside teams like the Cardinals, Falcons and Vikings.Full Week 13 projected linesAwayHomeLookaheadConsensusPR SpreadNotesGBDET-3-2.5-2.5KCDAL+4.5+3+4.5Market not crediting big KC win?CINBAL-7.5-7-7Burrow return makes it tough to gaugeCHIPHI-7-7-5ATLNYJ+1.5+2.5+2.5ARITB-6.5-3-13 makes sense if Baker plays hurtHOUIND-4.5-4.5-5.5NOMIA-4.5-6-5.5LARCAR+9.5+10.5+9.5SFCLE+6.5+5.5+4CLE D will dictate flow of gameJACTEN+7+6.5+6.5Ward improving week by weekMINSEA-7.5-10.5-10Could Brosmer be an improvement?BUFPIT+4.5+3.5+4.5LVLAC-8.5-9.5-7DENWAS+6.5+6.5+6NYG   NE   -7.5   -7.5   -7   This is how I would set each game based on my power ratings and home-field advantage data for this week. A large discrepancy between the projected power rating lines and the market lines does not make the game an auto play, but it gives us a basis for potential strong picks pending further analysis.\n            ",

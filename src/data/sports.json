    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl season kicks off on Saturday when Boise State battles Washington in the 2025 LA Bowl at 8 p.m. ET. Over the course of the next five weeks, there will be 46 bowl matchups (including all College Football Playoff games) and the college football bowl schedule includes some stylistically intriguing battles. After being snubbed by the College Football Playoff committee, Notre Dame has chosen not to participate in a bowl, but No. 12 BYU, who was also left out, will play No. 22 Georgia Tech in the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Dec. 27.BYU is a 4.5-point favorite in the latest college football bowl odds, but will they actually show up motivated after it looks like they weren't given serious consideration for the 12-team playoff? Motivation is always a factor during bowl season and it's something that you'll need to consider as you make your college football bowl confidence picks.

The Aggies finished 11-1 and 7-1 in the SEC, tying for first place, but missed out on playing in the conference championship after losing at Texas 27-17 on Nov. 28. The Hurricanes, who tied for second with four other teams at 6-2 in the ACC and were 10-2 overall, have won four in a row.Quarterback Marcel Reed helps power the A&M offense. The sophomore has completed 61.8% of his passes for 2,932 yards and 25 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and a 153.2 rating. He has also rushed 89 times for 466 yards (5.2 average) and six touchdowns. In a 38-17 win over No. 22 Missouri on Nov. 8, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 221 yards and two touchdowns. Miami, meanwhile, is led by senior quarterback Carson Beck. He has completed 74.7% of his passes this season for 3,072 yards and 25 touchdowns with 10 interceptions and a 165.8 rating. Beck has also rushed for one score. In a 38-7 win over No. 22 Pittsburgh on Nov. 29, he completed 23 of 29 passes for 267 yards and three touchdowns with one interception. See who else to pick here.New users can also check out the latest bet365 bonus code to get $150 in bonus bets after placing a $5 bet:How to make college football bowl confidence picks  Casale is also going all-in on an underdog with one of his most confident picks.

This year, we've added a column for those of you who play in four-point-per-pass TD leagues, and a column for half-PPR leagues! Yes finally.                      The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart.                      By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has two or more players than the other. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).                     \nThis list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.                      Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my updated projected rest of season schedule rankings available on SportsLine later this week.                          \nYou can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at drichard@cbs.com or at @daverichard on X.

    "body": "\nMoods can sour quickly at Real Madrid but even then, the boos that rang around Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on Sunday following the team's 2-0 loss to Celta Vigo were as clear a sign as any – manager Xabi Alonso is on the hot seat, just six months after taking the job.Real Madrid's near perfect start to the season has completely unraveled, sliding from a five point lead atop LaLiga to a four point deficit to Barcelona in the span of a month and change. They now have just one win in their last five league games, the UEFA Champions League serving as a reprieve of sorts with four wins out of five thus far. Even then, though, certain cracks are starting to emerge – a lack of cohesion is obvious just about every time Los Blancos play, a mixture of injuries and tactical issues piling up as they hit a rough patch.It leaves them uniquely vulnerable against City, who may not be at the peak of their powers as Pep Guardiola rebuilds the team yet again but are still winning more often than not and boast one of the sport's greatest cheat codes in Erling Haaland. Alonso will face off against his former manager at Bayern Munich, marking a fascinating test for the Madrid boss, who now has to prove his worth against Guardiola in the hopes of staying in the job.How to watch Real Madrid vs. Manchester City, oddsDate: Wednesday, Dec. 10 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Santiago Bernabeu Stadium -- Madrid, SpainLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Real Madrid +180; Draw +280; Manchester City +130Alonso's vision fails to come togetherWhen Alonso succeeded Carlo Ancelotti as Madrid's manager in late spring, he promised a revamp that would not only resemble his double-winning Bayer Leverkusen team but many successful teams that would allow Los Blancos to re-envision themselves with the modern game in mind. The hallmarks of Alonso's Madrid were supposed to be a high, intense press and an intentional approach in attack, something that was beginning to come together in the early weeks of the season.Their win in El Clasico in October was supposed to be a sign that things are trending in the right direction but Alonso's side have failed to live up to the mark since. Injuries to the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen and Eder Militao have not helped but his team is not clicking despite notching 13 wins in 14 games to start the campaign. The characteristics Alonso has wanted to define his Madrid team are nowhere in sight – conceding goals is easier than it should be against a team that is surprisingly lax in defense, to the point that they have conceded nine goals in their last seven games across all competitions.Alonso has yet to strike a true balance in attack, a problem he inherited but one he was also explicitly tasked with fixing. Kylian Mbappe has been the focal point of Los Blancos' offense with 26 goals across all competitions this season but he is the only star with any consistency – Vinicius Junior has gone 11 games without scoring and Rodrygo, who almost exited this summer, is now on a 33-game goal drought. They may be overly reliant on Mbappe, too, winning just two games in which the France international has not scored.Conflicting personalitiesBehind the lack of cohesion on the pitch is tension off it, with different personalities taking issue with Alonso's approach. There are reports out of Spain that club president Florentino Perez may fire Alsonso if Real Madrid lose to City on Wednesday, Alonso potentially posed to join a list of 10 other managers who got fired after lasting anywhere from three months to a year.Vinicius is reportedly unwilling to sign a contract extension with the club because of his difficult relationship with Alonso, according to The Athletic, his current deal set to expire in June 2027. Higher-ups at Real Madrid also stuck around at the Bernabeu for several hours after the defeat to Celta Vigo to discuss Alonso's future and whether or not his tactics-first approach works for a team defined primarily by its star power, according to the BBC.Alonso: 'The team is united'Perhaps out of obligation, Alonso struck an optimistic but professional tone in his pre-match remarks ahead of Wednesday's clash against City, insisting his team is still on the right path.\"We're all together in this,\" he said. \"We're mentally ready to face everything that comes: the team is united, convinced that we can win tomorrow, no one has any doubts about that. It is the Champions League. We are at the Bernabeu. The atmosphere will be special. That creates a different energy, including in the players.\"Naturally, he fielded questions about whether the sense of togetherness he is trying to project, responding in the affirmative when asked if he believes the whole team is behind him. He then made a concession of sorts.\"Being Madrid manager is not about changing [the culture]; it is about adapting,\" Alonso said. \"We know the culture of Real Madrid pretty well; that is why it is the biggest club in the world. You have to adapt, learn a lot, interact with the players. Some days are good, some not so good. We have to face that with energy and positivity, that is the only way to turn things around.\"He also hoped the disappointment from Sunday's loss can be translated positively into a strong performance against City.\"I'm looking forward to what's coming and that starts tomorrow, [an opportunity] to turn 'round the anger,\" Alonso said. \"In our heads, there's only City. In football, for better or worse, things change quickly.\"Projected lineupsReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Raul Asensio, Antonoi Rudiger, Alvaro Carreras, Fran Garcia, Aurelien Tchouameni, Federico Valverde, Franco Mastantuono, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, Vinicius JuniorManchester City: Gianluigi Donnarumma, Abdukodir Khusanov, John Stones, Nathan Ake, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Nico Gonzalez, Rico Lewis, Tijjani Reijnders, Oscar Bobb, Jeremy Doku, Erling HaalandPredictionHe may have started the job a few months ago, but it's already time to talk about Xabi Alonso's job security, momentum perhaps swinging in Manchester City's favor ahead of the most anticipated game on Matchday 6. Momentum is not the only reason to pick City -- flawed as they are in Pep Guardiola's latest rebuild, the ideas seem to be clicking more often than not, plus Erling Haaland's always impressive form always makes them a contender. Pick: Real Madrid 1, Manchester City 2\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On the surface level, Chelsea's 2-1 defeat in Bergamo on Tuesday had the look of one inflicted on them by Enzo Maresca making the wrong adjustments at the back end of the pitch. A midfield of right backs and a back four that had been forced into too many changes buckled, Charles De Ketelaere went charging up the gut and what once seemed to be a vital win in an archetypal tough place to go on the continent became a fifth straight road defeat in the Champions League for Chelsea.\nIt need not have been that way. When Reece James powered to the byline to cross for Joao Pedro, Chelsea were entitled to feel that their foothold in the game was well earned. They had quelled the early threat of Atalanta passes in behind their full back and had built momentum. This was hardly the Blues at their best but they were in the ascendancy. All they needed to do was push on from their 25th minute lead.Instead, it wasn't until 25 minutes later that Chelsea registered another shot. In that time they got into the Atalanta penalty area on four separate occasions. None of those involved Joao Pedro, who was next spotted in the box again in the 91st minute as the visitors desperately chased parity. You couldn't fault the Brazilian's commitment to come back, to drop into space and help build attacks but when Chelsea needed focal points through which to extend their lead, they lacked one.Unfortunately that has been too common a story for Chelsea this season. Naturally their attack is not what it was in 2024-25 because they have largely not had any version of Cole Palmer, let alone the one at the peak of his powers early last season who seemed capable of firing a one man title challenge. Nor have they often had Liam Delap, though when he has actually taken the field this season the Chelsea No.9 has not offered overwhelming evidence that he was ready to make the leap from the bar room brawl at the bottom end of the Premier League to the more rarified air that his new employers occupy.\nNor, indeed, did they have the divisive figure of Nicolas Jackson, whose ill-discipline and occasionally wayward finishing masked a striker who was very good at getting shots and penalty box touches. Last season the now Bayern Munich loanee averaged 0.51 non-penalty expected goals per 90 starting minutes in the Premier League. Joao Pedro and Delap might have bettered him in raw output but more predictive metrics suggested that Jackson would be better placed to get the ball in dangerous areas.He was not the only player to depart in last summer who was very adept at finding the ball in the penalty area. In total Chelsea have lopped off about five touches in the box from their tally of 31.7 per Premier League game last season. Where those have gone is fairly straightforward. Jackson, Noni Madueke and Jadon Sancho took them when they walked out the door. Add those three to Palmer and you have a quartet that would have frequently started Premier League games, combining for an average of 25.4 penalty box touches per 90 minutes as starters. By the same criteria last night's front four of Fernandez, Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens and Pedro Neto average 17.4. In the case of each player who left the squad there were understandable factors to defend Chelsea's decision-making progress, not least the lack of end product. This season's figures include one midfielder in Fernandez, who, while developing well in the final third, is still developing and another in Pedro who was bought as much to provide cover for Palmer as to lead the line. Still, whatever the caveats, that is a sizeable amount of penalty box pressure to lose.\nThat much was apparent against Atalanta. For 90 minutes Maresca's side could get the ball close to where they wanted to go without taking the final step. In terms of attacking third touches they bettered their opponent by a fair margin, 155 to 115. Go to the danger zone and the story changes to one that slightly favors Atalanta, 24 to 22. La Dea would end this game nine shots in the box to Chelsea's six, plenty of more of them asking real questions of the defense too.Maresca's view was that Gianluca Scamacca's equaliser had brought out the worst qualities in his side, who had suddenly found themselves more error prone as Atalanta revived the atmosphere that Chelsea had done such a fine job of quelling. \"After the goal we conceded, we lost a little bit of control of the game,\" he said. \"In the first half, we scored the goal, we conceded something, but also we created some chances. In the second half, I think we had two good chances to score the second one. And then again, after we conceded the 1-1 [goal], we lost a little bit of control of the game, and then we conceded the second one.\"\nAnd yet the control that the visitors did have before they were pegged back was a particularly ineffective type when they couldn't apply it everywhere on the pitch. A double effort by James was their most notable moment of cutting through but there was little to have Atalanta fearing that a more open game might lead to them getting a few more smashed past them. Given there was so little sustained threat on their goal, why wouldn't the Italians start creeping forward in much the same fashion that Sunderland had when they earned the same result for themselves earlier this season.\nNone of this is impossible for Maresca to address. Palmer is not necessarily in the highest echelon when it comes to penalty box touches but matters come a little more naturally to him in those areas than they do Fernandez, who it must be noted has developed excellently when it comes to his late scoring darts into the penalty area. Palmer's absence on Tuesday night was part of Chelsea's careful plan to gradually reintegrate their No.10 into the first team. Perhaps that approach was vindicated in the most frustrating way last night. If this is how hard things can be without their star playmaker, there is nothing worse than gambling with his fitness.There were other adjustments Maresca could have made though. At just 18 years of age Estevao is already very good at some of the very hard parts of attacking and averages more touches in the box this Premier League season than anyone who has played over 400 minutes and is not named Noni Madueke or Jeremy Doku. Maresca indicated that the Brazilian could have entered the fray had it not been for the eye injury suffered when Scamacca's stray boot connected with Wesley Fofana. The man he did turn to to freshen up the attack, Alejandro Garnacho, is another who can get the ball into prime spaces though he has still yet to kick his addiction to long range shots when there are better options ahead of him.Whoever is in the XI this can still be a Chelsea attack to fear. It is barely more than a fortnight since they danced around flailing Barcelona limbs. It is inevitable that young teams like this one will need to learn how to do so more consistently and the very real prospect that this team will now finish outside the top eight of the league phase means two more games in which to develop the right habits. \"If we want to try to finish top eight, we need to win both,\" said Maresca. \"Otherwise, we try to play the play-off and then go to the next round.\"\nMore games might afford more opportunities for Chelsea to really click, as they have been so temptingly close to on numerous occasions this season. And that team at full strength could well make these questions of their ability to manufacture penalty box touches look daft indeed, vindicating some recruitment decisions that look rather curious in hindsight. For now, however, it is hard to shake the sense that the reforging of their attack in the summer has given Maresca's side a smidge less ooomph and that that is placing pressure on a defense that buckled in Bergamo.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Barcelona's return to the Camp Nou for Champions League play for the first time in more than three years was almost spoiled by Eintracht Frankfurt in a 2-1 victory on Wednesday. A second-half brace from Jules Kounde helped Barcelona overturn a deficit and win at home, but it's also a deficit that they never should've been in, as despite having ambitions to win this competition, the defense hasn't been able to hold up, while the attack hasn't hit the highs of last season either.Previously, when a team went to the Camp Nou, it felt like a challenge that they wouldn't be able to overcome, but when players are speaking out about how they can study the offside trap, and it doesn't change and a team who allowed six goals in their last match can mark Robert Lewandowski out of a match, that mystique is gone.There are a few reasons for that, as one is the offside trap and how, if players can stay in line or play around it, Barcelona don't have a true defensive stopper to play enforcer when a counter is getting out of hand, but their play style only works when their entire attacking band is in sync. On Tuesday, it wasn't as Lewandowski only took 19 touches during the entire match, the fewest of any Barcelona starter despite playing 66 minutes. The 37-year-old took two shots, not putting any on target, and he has now failed to score or assist a goal in Champions League play despite playing in five matches. The lone match that Lewandowski didn't feature in was Barcelona's 6-1 victory over Olympiacos, which accounts for almost half of their 14 goals scored during the league phase.\nFerran Torres and Marcus Rashford have also taken turns leading the line, creating a more mobile attack, and it's something Hansi Flick will have to think about as he sets up his team moving forward. Barcelona are set to make it through the league phase as they sit 14th after six matches. They could fall to 20th, but with Slavia Prague and Copenhagen as their remaining teams, they should be comfortably through.The issue is that when Barcelona are expected to win the Champions League after making it to the semifinals last season, after six matches, they've scored 14 goals and allowed 11 goals. Facing top teams in UCL such as Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, Barcelona have failed to get results there, showing the cracks in Flick's tactics when they can't control a game from start to finish. They've struggled with big teams and even ones they'd be expected to top easily. Frankfurt had a chance of going in that direction, but Marcus Rashford and Kounde had to save them from allowing one of the easiest counters that you'll see. Nathaniel Brown played a ball that the Barcelona defenders couldn't get to, and Ansgar Knauff slotted it home. \nFrankfurt have been far from defensive stalwarts as of late, which is where concern sinks in. If Barcelona can't take care of these teams with ease, how can they expect to push past teams in the knockout phase? It's easier to change the attacking personnel than it is to sign defenders, so this may be the time to begin looking into what life may be without Lewandowski leading the line.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Milan -- The game is over, and Liverpool won 1-0 against Inter in Milan thanks to a controversial penalty, but the away end was only singing one name: Arne Slot. Normally, that wouldn't seem unusual, but given what has happened in recent days, it feels more significant than ever. It's clear the fans have made their stance known. It was an intense weekend for Liverpool manager Slot, who had to face the frustration of one of the most influential players in the recent history of the English giants going against the Dutch manager and the club. Mo Salah, one of the biggest stars of the team, went public after Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday and spoke openly about this moment.\"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame. I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship. I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club,\" he said. Since the bombshell interview became viral, many things happened. Salah wasn't included in the Liverpool squad traveling to Milan where the Reds faced Inter on Tuesday at the San Siro, a decision that was agreed by Slot and the club, while the manager seemed annoyed but also clear in his words when he was asked his opinion on the matter ahead of Tuesday's match.\"I have no clue if he played his last match with Liverpool. I am a firm believer there is always a possibility for a player to return. But if he has the right to share it with the media, then we have to react with it. So he's out,\" Slot said.\nOn Tuesday morning, few hours before kickoff of such an important match for the Reds that are not facing their best moment, Salah posted on his social media a picture of him training alone at the club, and a few minutes before the Liverpool match started, the CBS Sports crew spoke on the matter, with Thierry Henry believing he made a mistake.\"When I was at Barcelona, I went away with the team. They put me in the stands. Did you hear me talking about it? No … We won the treble the year before but I wasn't performing so if you're not performing, you put yourself in the situation where you leave the door open for someone to [get] in. I traveled, we arrived at the stadium, I'm in the stands. Am I going to make a fuss about it? Am I going to make it about myself? Am I going to talk to the press after? I have achieved stuff in the game but team first. If I had to say something – and by the way, I said it. I said it to [manager] Pep [Guardiola], what I thought about what was happening, but not publicly,\" he said. The game was pretty even, and Liverpool showed they are still in control of their future, even if they didn't play their best game, especially for how the penalty was awarded for a weak foul of Alessandro Bastoni on Florian Wirtz. But what emerged from the match at San Siro was how the fans reacted and chanted the name of Slot twice, once before and once right after Tuesday's win after the final whistle.\nSalah will travel for the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Egypt on Dec. 15, and if they advance to the final, he wouldn't return to Liverpool until after Jan. 18, when the winter transfer window will be open. His future is in doubt and we don't really know what will happen in the coming weeks, but for sure Liverpool fans know where they stand and this time they have decided to take the side of Slot, the Dutch manager who won the Premier League in first season at the club and replaced club icon Jurgen Klopp in the summer of 2024. That may feel ages ago, but after a rough beginning to the season, perhaps this is the start of a new chapter.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark publicly backed his ACC counterpart Tuesday after Notre Dame's athletics director tore into the league over the Irish being left out of the College Football Playoff.Notre Dame AD Pete Bevacqua has openly questioned the ACC's support after Miami -- an ACC member -- jumped the Irish for the final at-large CFP berth. Bevacqua told \"The Dan Patrick Show\" on Monday that Notre Dame's relationship with the ACC sustained \"permanent damage.\"His decision to go after the league so forcefully, and so publicly, didn't sit well with Yormark.\"Pete's behavior has been egregious,\" Yormark said Tuesday during a panel at the Intercollegiate Athletics Forum in Las Vegas. \"It's been egregious going after [ACC commissioner] Jim Phillips when they saved Notre Dame during COVID. We all knew, and it was very transparent -- [CFP committee chairman] Hunter [Yurachek] was very transparent about it, that as Notre Dame and Miami got closer together, head-to-head would be a factor.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Notre Dame AD says ACC did 'permanent damage' to relationship with push for Miami over Irish\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn 2020, Notre Dame was granted temporary ACC membership to play a full football schedule during the shortened season.\"I think [Bevacqua] is totally out of balance in his approach, and if he were in the room, I'd tell him the same thing,\" Yormark said Tuesday.In the penultimate CFP rankings, BYU sat between Notre Dame and Miami but fell to Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game, giving the committee room to take a hard look at the Hurricanes and Irish. Miami's season-opening win over Notre Dame became the decisive wedge that pushed the Hurricanes into the field.\nBevacqua argued the ACC \"singled out\" two-loss Notre Dame as it worked to elevate Miami.\"We were mystified by the actions of the conference to attack their biggest business partner in football and a member of their conference in 24 of our other sports,\" Bevacqua said Monday. Phillips rejected that assertion.\"The University of Notre Dame is an incredibly valued member of the ACC, and there is tremendous respect and appreciation for the entire institution,\" Phillips said in a statement Monday. \"With that said, when it comes to football, we have a responsibility to support and advocate for all 17 of our football-playing member institutions, and I stand behind our conference efforts to do just that leading up to the College Football Playoff Committee selections on Sunday.\n\"At no time was it suggested by the ACC that Notre Dame was not a worthy candidate for inclusion in the field. We are thrilled for the University of Miami while also understanding and appreciating the significant disappointment of the Notre Dame players, coaches and program.\"Notre Dame declined a bowl invitation after the school was left out of the playoff.Yormark was a proponent for BYU's inclusion in the playoff, but said he understood why the Cougars were not included in the field after suffering a second loss to Texas Tech.\n\"I think overall, they did the right job,\" Yormark said. \"It's progress over perfection. The selection process will never be perfect. And our goal as commissioners and the management committee is how do we improve upon it?\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MLB's fourth amateur Draft Lottery will take place Tuesday night at the Winter Meetings in Orlando. MLB and the MLB Players Association agreed to the lottery as part of the current collective bargaining agreement in an effort to curb tanking and anti-competitive behavior in general. The top six picks are now awarded through the lottery. The Nationals won the Draft Lottery last offseason and received the No. 1 pick in the 2025 Draft despite finishing with the league's sixth-worst record. Washington took shortstop Eli Willits with the No. 1 pick. The Mariners also won big when they moved up from the No. 14 pick to the No. 3 pick. The 121-loss White Sox got bumped back to the No. 10 pick for revenue sharing reasons, which we'll explain in a moment. 2026 MLB Draft Lottery streaming info Date: Tuesday, Dec. 9 | Time: 5:30 p.m. ET TV channel: MLB Network | Live stream: Fubo (try for free) The lottery itself will be held at approximately 4 p.m. ET.

Here now is everything you need to know going into Tuesday's Draft Lottery.\n Odds for No. 1 pick The 18 non-postseason teams in 2025 each have a chance at the No. 1 selection in the 2026 Draft through the lottery, though the worst teams have the best odds.

That's why the Rangers (78-84 in 2024) have better 2026 Draft Lottery odds than the Giants (80-82 in 2024) even though the two clubs finished with identical 81-81 records in 2025.Why are the Rockies not eligible? Despite going 43-119 this past season, baseball's worst record by 17 games, the Rockies are not eligible for a lottery pick in next year's draft. That's because teams cannot pick in the lottery in more than two consecutive years and Colorado had the No. 3 pick in 2024 and the No. 4 pick in 2025. That bumps them out of the lottery in 2026. The earliest the Rockies can pick is No. 10 overall.Why are the Angels and Nationals not eligible?Teams that pay into the league's revenue-sharing program cannot hold lottery picks in consecutive years. The Nationals (No. 1 pick in 2025) and the Angels (No. 2 pick in 2025) both fall into this bucket. They pay revenue sharing, so last year's lottery picks bump them out of this year's lottery. Like the Rockies, the Angels and Nationals cannot pick any earlier than No. 10 overall. This rule is why the White Sox were ineligible for the 2025 Draft Lottery despite losing 121 games in 2024. They pay revenue sharing and had the No. 5 pick in 2024.The rest of the first round Previously, the Draft order was set by the reverse order of the previous year's standings. It was nice and easy. Now the top six picks are determined through the lottery, the remaining 12 non-postseason teams then pick in reverse order of the standings (picks 7-18), and the 12 postseason teams pick in order of their finish (picks 19-30).  Furthermore, within each \"tier\" of postseason finish, those teams pick in reverse order of the standings, with teams that receive revenue sharing picking before teams that pay into revenue sharing. Got it? Good. Here is the order for the No. 19-30 picks: Wild Card Series losers19. Reds (83-79, receive revenue sharing)20. Guardians (88-74, receive revenue sharing)21. Red Sox (89-73, pay revenue sharing)22. Padres (90-72, pay revenue sharing)Division Series losers23. Tigers (87-75, receive revenue sharing)24. Cubs (92-70, pay revenue sharing)25. Yankees (94-68, pay revenue sharing)26. Phillies (96-66, pay revenue sharing)Championship Series losers 27. Mariners (90-72, receive revenue sharing) 28. Brewers (97-65, receive revenue sharing) World Series loser 29. Blue Jays (94-68) World Series winner 30. Dodgers (93-69) This order is not final. The Dodgers, Mets, and Yankees will all have their first-round pick moved back 10 spots because of their competitive balance tax (CBT) status. Teams that exceed the third CBT threshold ($281 million in 2025) have their first rounder pushed back 10 spots. The Yankees and Dodgers will get bumped back from Nos. 25 and 30 to Nos. 35 and 40, respectively. We don't know where the Mets will pick yet because they're eligible for the lottery. Lottery picks are not subject to CBT penalties. If the Mets move into the top six picks in the lottery, the penalty will be applied to their second-round pick, and that will be moved back instead. New York keeps a lottery pick. Otherwise their first rounder moves back 10 spots. The rest of the draft Only the first round is set using the Lottery. The order of rounds 2-20 is the reverse order of this year's standings, so the MLB-worst Rockies will have the first pick of the second round regardless of how the lottery shakes out. There are also free-agent compensation and competitive balance round picks scattered throughout the draft. Those additional picks will be determined throughout the offseason. Tuesday's lottery will set the first-round order. Everything after that is TBD as the offseason plays out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Four years after being fired by LSU, Ed Orgeron has not been shy about his desire to get back into coaching.Plenty has changed in the college football landscape in those years, most notably players being able to get paid via name, image and likeness deals and now through revenue sharing directly from the schools themselves. That's an adjustment every coach has had to make, and some have adapted to the new way of the college football world better than others. In a recent appearance on \"Bussin' With The Boys,\" Orgeron joked that after all his years coaching in the SEC, paying players via NIL will only require a \"minor adjustment.\"\n\"They say, 'Hey coach, you been out of coaching for awhile. How you gonna adjust to NIL?' Orgeron said. \"I said, well, it's a minor adjustment. 'What do you mean?' Well, back then we used to walk through the back door with the cash. Now we just gotta walk through the front door with the cash.\"Orgeron has long been known as an elite recruiter and that's not a title one could get without knowing how to get things done in the shadows. Now all those conversations and negotiations happen above the table, and Orgeron is pretty confident he can make that small adjustment if he were to land back on a sideline soon. \nOrgeron, of course, coached LSU to a national title in 2019 but was let go following the 2021 season. In all, Orgeron had a 51-20 record leading LSU, but went just 11-11 combined in the two years following the national championship. He has not coached since, but the 64-year-old is looking to get back in the action -- perhaps even back in Baton Rouge with the Tigers. \n            \n    ",

Fannin finished Week 14 as the TE1 with eight catches for 114 yards and one touchdown. And you know what, he'd been building to something just like this. Fannin has had his moments throughout the year, but he looks truly elite with Shedeur Sanders. In Sanders' three starts, Fannin ranks second amongst all tight ends with a 27.8% target share. His 2.32 yards per route run and 14.9 PPR FPPG both rank fourth amongst tight ends in that stretch. His 17-game pace with Sanders is 85 catches for 1,116 yards and 11 touchdowns. Like I said, elite.Now it has only been three games, so I don't want to make any grand proclamations about Fannin over the rest of the season. I will just say that he is TE3 in the rankings for me this week, and all three of our rankers have him ranked as a top-five tight end. If you already have Trey McBride or George Kittle, you should strongly consider Fannin in the flex, particularly in full PPR. While Fannin is doing what we love to see from rookies, Tyler Warren is headed in the opposite direction. With Daniel Jones out for the year, Warren's recent slump in production is forecast to continue. He's just barely inside my top 12 tight ends this week, even though the Seahawks have been pretty bad against tight ends this year. It is possible Philip Rivers does something miraculous and fixes things, but we aren't holding our breath. If you've picked up Juwan Johnson, Theo Johnson, or Fannin recently, you can start them over Warren in Week 15.Here's everything else you need to know about tight end in Week 15:\n\n        Week 15 TE Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            29.4% -- Kyle Pitts has a 29.4% target share in the four games Drake London has missed. He is a must-start if London is out this week.12.5 -- Isaiah Likely scored 12.5 PPR Fantasy points the last time the Ravens played the Bengals, and he should have had 20. Either he or Mark Andrews is likely to be a good start, maybe both.21.7% -- Theo Johnson has a 21.7% target share with Jaxson Dart on the field this season. He could have a monster game against the Commanders.13.3 -- Since Week 9, Colston Loveland is TE6 with an average of 13.3 PPR FPPG.6.93 -- The Bills are giving up a league-low 6.93 PPR FPPG to tight ends this season. You should probably avoid Hunter Henry.5.5 -- Oronde Gadsden has only averaged 5.5 PPR FPPG since Joe Alt went down.Week 15 Streamers (TE Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYG\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

In Week 13, when Dart returned, Johnson tied for the team lead in targets with eight. The rookie loves his tight end and should have success targeting him against the Washington Commanders. Washington has given up the third most PPR Fantasy points to opposing tight ends and just gave up three touchdowns to the Vikings tight ends.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #84\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CLE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -7.5\n                                    O/U 39.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS TE\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    TE RNK\n                                \n                                12th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                63%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    35\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    49\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    435\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    8.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Loveland scored 12.9 PPR Fantasy points in the team's first game without Rome Odunze, the second time in three games he's scored at least that much.

the main slate. The Bears have given up the sixth most receptions to tight ends this season, and Fannin is clearly Shedeur Sanders' favorite target. This should be another game where the Browns play from behind and have to air it out. Don't be surprised if Sanders throws 40 passes and Fannin has another game with double-digit targets.\n            \n            \nContrarian DFS Play\n                        Projections powered by\n

him a bad play this week, at least according to the projections. I am willing to take that type of risk for a contrarian player when I am getting a great player in a great matchup. Seattle has given up the second most points to tight ends this year, and I expect the Colts will be playing from behind. Again, this is only as a contrarian play, but it's a great one.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    TE Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 15 Fantasy football projections for every position is now available on SportsLine.

I have 28 wide receivers projected to score at least 12 PPR Fantasy points and 39 who I expect to score in double digits. That is a significant improvement from what we have been dealing with. Still, I would imagine a lot of teams are looking at their receiver room with dread. That may be because of frustrations with Justin Jefferson or Emeka Egbuka, or it may be because you have lost faith in the Colts and Chargers wideouts. I don't have any of them ranked in my top 24 this week.We'll start with the obvious. Jefferson is WR32 on the season and WR51 since Week 9. He cannot get on the same page with J.J. McCarthy, and last week McCarthy threw three touchdowns to tight ends and only four passes to Jefferson. The only reason Jefferson is still in my top 30 is because of his name and what I believe is still true about his talent.Egbuka was one of the bright spots of the first half of the season, but he has gone ice-cold. He hasn't scored double-digit Fantasy points in a game since Week 10, and he has only done it once since Week 5. With Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan expected back, I am not even sure Egbuka is a good WR3.The Colts, well, they're obvious too. Daniel Jones is out for the season, and they will either be catching passes from Riley Leonard or Philip Rivers. Yes, Rivers is back, at least on the practice squad. Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce both had good games in Week 14, but now they are facing the Seahawks. Stay away.\nThe Chargers may be the least obvious, but it is no less true. Since Joe Alt went down in Week 9, the Chargers do not have one wide receiver ranked in the top 30. Ladd McConkey is the only wide receiver ranked in the top 50! Justin Herbert is averaging 6.4 yards per pass attempt without Alt on the field, and it is crushing their Fantasy prospects. They've also trended more run-heavy lately, and with Omarion Hampton back, I would expect that to intensify.Here is the rest of the Week 15 WR Preview:\n\n        Week 15 WR Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to Know\n                \n                    \n            28% -- Wan'Dale Robinson has a 28.4% target share for the season, which ranks seventh best among wide receivers this season. He's a start.13.6 -- DK Metcalf had an aDOT of 13.6 in Week 14, three yards higher than his season average. Hopefully, this continues through the playoffs.30.83 -- In three games without Marvin Harrison, Michael Wilson has averaged 30.8 PPR FPPG. He has not scored double-digit Fantasy points in a game Harrison has played.28.6% -- Since Brian Thomas returned, Jakobi Meyers leads Jacksonville with a 26.7% target share. He is the clear WR1 in Jacksonville and a WR2 in Fantasy.20% -- Luther Burden led the Bears with a 20% target share in their first game without Rome Odunze.65.4% -- Jayden Reed had a 65.8% route participation in his first game back. He's a WR3 for Fantasy purposes.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    WR Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Waiver Wire Targets\n                \n                    \n            Week 15 Adds (WR Preview)\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #10\n                                            \n                                            Age: 21\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CLE\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CHI -7.5\n                                    O/U 40\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                3rd\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                32nd\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                29%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    40\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    395\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    6.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                I am really not sure why Burden is still just 29% rostered. He is a consensus WR3 for us this week, and he just led his team in targets. He has been the Bears' most efficient wide receiver all season long, and he just played a season-high 71.4% of the offensive snaps. There is big-time upside, even against a good defense like the Browns.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        GB\n                    \n                         \n                        Green Bay\n                    \n                                            • #11\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        DEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -2.5\n                                    O/U 43\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS WR\n                                \n                                9th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    WR RNK\n                                \n                                38th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                50%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TAR\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    76\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    7.6\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Reed was close to a full-time player in his first game back and scored 9.3 Fantasy points on four targets and two rush attempts. The Packers are behaving as if Reed is healthy, and he is the ultimate boom or bust WR3 when he's 100%. It will be a tough week for all the Packers wide receivers, but Reed has the potential for two or three gimmick plays per game, and he has been very good after the catch for most of his short

    "body": "\n        Wether it's the Broncos, Patriots, Rams, Seahawks or any other NFL contender, one thing is for sure -- the roster of singers on Super Bowl Sunday are all stars in their own right. In addition to the announcement of Bad Bunny being named the featured halftime performer earlier this season, we know that Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones have been added to the list of singers for the big game next February.The Bad Bunny announcement followed months of rumors and predictions, and was made in a subtle way back at the end of September. Headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the top singing gigs of the year, and this was how the 31-year-old singer made the announcement on social media. \nThe Puerto Rican singer is the most-streamed artist in the world. Bad Bunny has 10 Grammy nominations, with three wins. His three Grammy wins are for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album for YHLQMDLG, Best Musica Urbana Album for El Último Tour Del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti.Some of his other awards include the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist, the BET Award for Single of the Year for his hit song \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and J Balvin and Billboard Top Latin.\nBad Bunny's top songs are \"Vete,\" \"Titi Me Pregunto,\" \"Que Pasaria\" and \"BAILE INoLIDABLE.\" Usually the special guests are announced closer to the championship game. One early guess for a special guest is Cardi B, who is also connected to the NFL because she recently gave birth to boy, the son of Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs. Rapper Kendrick Lamar, who brought out multiple special guests including SZA and Serena Williams, was last year's headliner. Some other iconic halftime performers include Prince, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few. The halftime show become a cultural moment for the masses as it is typically the most-watched performance of the year. \nBut the day's festivities begin long before halftime. Multiple artists will perform ahead of the game, including Grammy-nominated singer Charlie Puth, 11x Grammy-winning artist Brandi Carlile and Grammy-winning R&B artist Coco Jones.\"Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them -- alongside our extraordinary deaf performers -- on Super Bowl LX's world stage,\" said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. \"This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.\" Here's a look at who will perform each pregame song:\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"Charlie Puth and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the national anthem ahead of the big game. Puth is a multi-award winning and multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer. His hits include \"See You Again,\" \"Attention\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore.\"\n\"America the Beautiful\"Brandi Carlile and Deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will perform \"America the Beautiful.\" Carlile has an impressive resume that includes an Oscar nomination, two Emmy wins and a book that reached No. 1 on The New York Times' bestsellers list. \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" will be performed by Coco Jones and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam. Jones has quickly made a name for herself in R&B music, with eight Grammy nominations. Her hit \"ICU\" is platinum certified. She is an actress as well as a musician.The 60th edition of the Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, on NBC. The backdrop of the game and performances will be Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n            ",

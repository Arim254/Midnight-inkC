    "body": "\n        With Tuesday's NBA schedule consisting of 11 games, there's a surplus of options for NBA parlay picks. However, you shouldn't limit your bets to just NBA picks against the spread or over/under predictions, since you can also seek out NBA props and wagers with plus-money NBA odds. The likes of NBA alternate lines, NBA winning margins, NBA fist scorer bets, and other NBA picks can be wagered on individually or combined into an NBA longshot parlay for a potentially massive return.Jarrett Allen of Cleveland is averaging 21.8 points in eight February games, but has a points over-under of just 13.5 in Cavaliers vs. Knicks (+4.5). Making NBA bets on Allen to score 20-plus points could return +492, and there are numerous other intriguing NBA prop bets for the day's other top games, including Thunder vs. Raptors (-2.5), Celtics vs. Suns (+5.5) and Lakers vs. Magic (+5).

The standard O/U is 206.5 but the model projects that line to be eclipsed in nearly 70% of simulations, as the teams are forecasted to combine for 220 points. These teams have engaged in nothing but high-scoring affairs recently, with each of their last four contests seeing at least 224 total points, as the four have averaged 230.1 combined points.This is a road game for Boston, and Celtics games average 3 more total points on the road (224.8) than at home (221.8). As for Phoenix, its defense has fallen apart as of late as it is allowing 7.5 more points in February than it did in January, while the Celtics have the league's No. 2 offensive rating. A total of 11 players will score more than 9 points, per the model, which allows the standard total to be eclipsed by over a dozen points. With 220 points projected, betting over the alternate total of 218.5 is the safe NBA prop to make. See which other NBA parlay picks to make on Tuesday here.How to make NBA parlay picks for Tuesday, Feb. 24The model also has locked in five more picks, including a pair of 1st scorer props that return over +800 in a longshot parlay that pays $1.1 million on just a $10 bet. You can only see the model's NBA parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top NBA parlay picks for Tuesday that could unlock a $1.1 million payday on just a $10 bet? Visit SportsLine now to see NBA best bets from a model that's returned more than $10,000 on top-rated picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Tuesday sports calendar is basketball-centric stateside with the NBA and college basketball taking the spotlight. Notable matchups in the NBA include Knicks vs. Cavaliers, Raptors vs. Thunder and Magic vs. Lakers. Duke vs. Notre Dame, Kentucky vs. South Carolina and Virginia vs. NC State are among the games to watch in college basketball. Other upcoming events include multiple Champions League matches in soccer and the PGA's Cognizant Classic on Thursday as the Florida Swing gets underway. The team at SportsLine uses a proven computer model that simulates every game 10,000 times, as well as a team of more than 40 Vegas experts to find the best values on the odds board for every major sport. The model is currently on an 11-1 run on top-rated college basketball betting picks for over/unders and is 38-18 on top-rated NBA betting picks against the spread. Sometimes the model and experts differ, but when they agree on picks, it can give users additional confidence that they are getting a strong value on a given bet.

Qualifying SportsLine members also receive free access to Paramount+ Premium, which now includes every UFC fight! Saint Louis vs. Dayton, 7 p.m. ET Pick: Saint Louis -3.5SportsLine's model projects an 83-73 win for Saint Louis as the Billikens cover in well over 60% of simulations. Expert Micah Roberts, who is on a 38-18 roll on college basketball picks (+1869), agrees, saying:\"Saint Louis is 25-2 on the year, which brings a big target on its back. The Billikens lost their last road game at Rhode Island 81-76 as a 9.5-point favorite. They were losing at home in their last game to VCU, but had a furious comeback in the second half to win. Dayton has won and covered its last three games, but it was on January 30th that they lost 102-71 to Saint Louis. Dayton played well that day, but had 15 turnovers, and Saint Louis shot 62% from the field. Saint Louis has the No. 1 defense in the nation, holding opponents to 36.3% shooting. The Billikens are 7-1 on the road, and I think they win this one by double-digits.\"New users can bet on Saint Louis (-3.5) with the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins:Warriors vs. Pelicans, 8 p.m. ETPick: De'Anthony Melton Under 16.5 total pointsSportsLine's model is projecting 16 points as Melton has failed to hit hit points total in four of the past six road games. NBA props expert Alex 'PropStarz' Selenick, who returned more than 75 units on his NBA picks over the past two full seasons, agrees with this prop, saying:\"Melton has eclipsed this number in three consecutive games, but I believe this is a significantly inflated line considering his playing time, role and usage. Melton hovers between 22-25 minutes and while he's never been afraid to shoot, this is projected to be a paced down environment. I would also argue that Melton looks like a regression candidate as well.\"Selesnick played that line at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users can sign up with the Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBSSPORTS250BM and receive a first bet match of up to $250 in bonus bets.How to get bets bets for NBA, college basketball and more at SportsLineNow that you've seen some of SportsLine's consensus picks for Tuesday, join to get picks for every game from a proven computer model and a team of more than 40 Vegas experts.

    "body": "\n        For the eighth time in promotional history, the UFC will present a fight card on Saturday from Mexico City. And, for the fifth time since that relationship began, former two-time flyweight champion Brandon Moreno will be featured prominently on the card. Moreno (23-9-2), a native of Tijuana who now lives and trains out of Las Vegas, became the first Mexican-born champion in UFC history when he captured the promotion's 125-pound title by submitting Deiveson Figueiredo in 2021, which was their second of four title bouts against one another in the history of their exciting rivalry. The 32-year-old Moreno will look to return to title contention and bounce back from a December TKO loss to Tatsuro Taira when he headlines UFC Fight Night inside Arena CDMX in the proud nation's capitol city. Moreno, who will face late replacement Lone'er Kavanagh (9-1) will also be fighting with the plight of his people in mind following days of unrest throughout the country. On Sunday, the Mexican government announced the capturing and death of powerful cartel leader Nemesio Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, commonly known as \"El Mencho,\" which set off a wave of retaliatory violence in major cities. \n\"I was walking yesterday in the streets and I stopped to watch my cellphone at all the bad news around the country,\" Moreno told CBS Sports HQ on Monday. \"Right now, in Mexico City, things here are super calm. All of the disaster is more to the north like Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Actually, my [home] city has reports of some destruction on the streets in Tijuana, that's the northwest. Thank life and thank God, my family is fine and the people all around me are fine. \"It has been really hard hours for my Mexican people. It's weird, man. It's crazy because, right now, I'm super focused on my fight but, at the same time, I know that a lot of Mexican people are focused on this bad moment. Maybe [the UFC Fight Night event] can be a nice moment for the people to try to forget the bad moment and get some joy.\"\nThe site of Saturday's card, in central Mexico, is located more than a six-hour drive away from the center of the unrest in the Mexican state of Jalisco, where citizens and tourists have been told to shelter in place. The U.S. State Department declared Tuesday that the majority of areas outside of Jalisco have \"returned to normal\" and UFC Fight Night will go on as scheduled. \n            ",

The Jayhawks entered the weekend having won nine of their last 10, but were stunned at home by Cincinnati, a double-digit underdog, on Saturday. That showed their downside, but recent wins against Iowa State, BYU, Arizona and Texas Tech also prove that they'll be a dangerous team in March.Duke Blue Devils: Jon Scheyer's squad made the Final Four last season, but he had to replace his entire starting five after they all left for the NBA.

Tuesday's NBA schedule includes a potential Eastern Conference postseason preview when the new-look Cleveland Cavaliers host the New York Knicks at 7:30 p.m. ET. One of the SportsLine Projection Model's top picks comes from Knicks vs. Cavaliers, backing Over 230.5 total points for its Tuesday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The Over has hit in three of the last four Cavs games.The model is also backing the Milwaukee Bucks to cover as 5.5-point underdogs against the Miami Heat. One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a college basketball pick on Duke vs. Notre Dame at 7 p.m. ET. According to the latest college basketball odds, Duke is favored by 17.5 points. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5+ bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons.

Harden has never been one celebrated for his defensive prowess, so both his playmaking offensive ability and lackluster defensive skillset have this model siding with the Over. Cleveland has allowed at least 113 points in three of those four games, and the Knicks have the No. 8 scoring offense at 117.6 points per game this season. Cleveland is third at 119.7 ppg this season. Jalen Brunson is ninth in the NBA at 26.8 ppg this season, and Karl-Anthony Towns is coming off back-to-back imposing scoring performances, scoring 25 and 28 points. The model projects the Over to hit in 58.6% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:Bucks (+5.5) vs. HeatGiannis Antetokounmpo (calf) remains out for the Bucks, but besides him, it's a rather clean injury report for a Milwaukee team that still has some talent. The Bucks had their three-game winning streak snapped in a 122-94 loss to the Raptors on Sunday, and although the Heat have won three straight games, none of them came against teams exactly playing the most motivated basketball at this point of the season (wins over the Pelicans, Hawks and Grizzlies). The Bucks have shown their depth with three different leading scorers over their last three games. Ryan Rollins has scored more than 20 points in six of seven games this month for the Bucks, who are 18-16 against the spread as the underdog this season. The model projects the Bucks to cover in 58% of simulations. Back the Bucks at DraftKings here:Duke (-17.5) vs. Notre Dame\"Duke enters the contest as one of the most mathematically dominant teams in the nation, ranking ninth overall in offensive efficiency and fourth in defensive efficiency,\" SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman said. \"The Fighting Irish counter with a pedestrian offensive efficiency of 114.9 (ranked 88th nationally) and a highly vulnerable defensive efficiency of 106.0 (ranked 109th). The Blue Devils have a magnificent 57.5% effective field goal percentage on the offensive end, a metric largely driven by a physically dominant interior presence that secures a massive 36.9% offensive rebounding rate. Notre Dame will be forced to compete without freshman guard Jalen Haralson, their leading scorer and primary offensive initiator, who has been ruled out of this contest with an unspecified injury.\" Back Duke at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks on Tuesday?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Inter are out of the UEFA Champions League after losing 5-2 on aggregate against Bodo/Glimt in the playoffs ahead of the knockout stages. The Norwegian team are playing in the elite European tournament for the first time in their history, but the Nerazzurri's elimination isn't a big surprise as it might look today. Cristian Chivu's team lost 3-1 away in the first leg, but many thought the defeat had to do with the challenging pitch and the hostile Norwegian weather. That was not the case. Bodo/Glimt showed again on Tuesday that they are an organized team, and demonstrated why they have already won against Manchester City and Atletico Madrid earlier in the league phase. \nInter showed a different attitude this season in the European tournament, especially as compared to last season when the Nerazzurri reached the Champions League final under Simone Inzaghi, after winning one of the most incredible Champions League semifinals against Barcelona over two legs. Last season's disappointments left a mark on this squad, not just for the humiliating 5-0 defeat in the final against PSG, but also for the Serie A title lost to Napoli in the last weeks of the season. The mentality of the players seemed much more similar to the ones that started the 2023-24 season after losing another Champions League final to Manchester City. Inter decided to rebound by focusing on the domestic league, and this season is no different. The Nerazzurri are at the top of the Serie A standings with a ten-point margin on their rivals, and will face AC Milan next week at San Siro for a crucial Derby della Madonnina that might put an end to the title race before it is too late. \nIronically, the shocking elimination against Bodo/Glimt might give them an extra boost of motivation for the final stretch of the Serie A season, knowing that reaching another Champions League final looked more complicated this season. Inter, and the other Italian teams, are not at the level of the English teams or the top European giants for multiple reasons. It's not just talent but also the financial wherewithal to secure that talent. Unlike them, they are kind of forced to think about one tournament at a time, and the ineffectiveness of last season proved it even more. \nInter will also need some of their top stars back at the top of their game. Players such as Nicolo Barella or Marcus Thuram looked lost, while Lautaro Martinez is recovering from a muscular injury suffered in the first leg in Norway. His comeback, alongside that of Denzel Dumfries, will be vital for their Serie A title ambitions. Meanwhile, there were some rumors coming from Spain about a possible pre-agreement between Inter and current Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone for the summer of 2026. Inter president Beppe Marotta spoke to Sky Italy and denied the rumours as \"fake news,\" but Chivu knows perfectly this is a strange world and winning the Serie A title will be the only way to cool the rumors down.\nBodo/Glimt have written their names into the books of history and now await a clash in the Round of 16 against either Sporting CP or Manchester City. It has been a month to remember for Norway in Italy: from Johannes Høsflot Klæbo's extraordinary six gold medals at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics to Bodo/Glimt becoming the first Norwegian side since 1987 to win a knockout tie in Europe's premier club competition. Norway will celebrate, and it's not over yet. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos are coming off one of the best seasons in franchise history. They went 14-3, surging past the Kansas City Chiefs to win the AFC West and earn the No. 1 seed in the conference before falling a game short of a Super Bowl appearance. Still, coach Sean Payton is making a major change for 2026 in hopes of sparking the offense. Payton revealed Tuesday at the NFL Scouting Combine that he is giving up play-calling duties to new offensive coordinator Davis Webb. Payton called Webb \"extremely talented,\" and said this decision is best for the team. \"It was something I kind of knew during the year. He and I visited on a handful of occasions. He's extremely talented. With regards to play-calling, I think he'll be really good at it,\" Payton said. In 2025, Denver's offense ranked 14th in scoring (23.6 points per game) and 10th in total offense (342.6 yards per game), while second-year signal-caller Bo Nix completed 63.4% of his passes for 3,931 yards, 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. At face value, those numbers are pretty solid, but there was a reason why Denver fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi last month. The Broncos made a habit of putting pressure on themselves with slow starts. In fact, Denver registered 12 comeback wins this past season -- an NFL record.\nIt was evident all year. The Broncos played with their food in the season opener against the lowly Tennessee Titans in a 20-12 victory, and then lost their next two games. In Week 5, the Broncos had to score 18 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles, 21-17. Two weeks later, the Broncos came back from down 19-0 in the fourth quarter to defeat the New York Giants, 33-32. According to CBS Sports Research, those 33 points were the most scored in a game in NFL history by a team that was being shut out entering the fourth quarter. Broncos fans were left wondering why their offense waited until the final 15 minutes to start playing.Payton struggled to get Nix and his offense into a rhythm. It's easy to criticize the quarterback whenever the offense can't stay on the field, but some of Payton's third-down play calls were questionable, including in critical situations. Look no further than Denver's controversial decision to go for it on fourth-and-1 in the first half of the AFC Championship game instead of kicking a chip-shot field goal in an eventual three-point loss. Payton called a bootleg or play-action pass that was doomed from the start. He said afterwards that he regretted the play call more than the decision to go for it. The other facet of this decision is the promotion of Webb, who clearly has already earned the trust of Payton and Nix. \nWho is Davis Webb?The 31-year-old Webb spent the past three years as the Broncos' quarterbacks coach. He served as the team's pass game coordinator in 2025 as well. A former NFL quarterback himself, Webb was selected in the third round in 2017 by the Giants. However, he played in just two NFL games before turning his attention to coaching. Webb has experienced a meteoric rise in the coaching world. He received head-coaching interest from the Las Vegas Raiders, Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens this offseason. Webb could have found a job as an offensive coordinator for another team, but the Broncos promoted him following Lombardi's firing and are now giving him play-calling duties.Longtime NFL backup quarterback Chase Daniel, who played for Payton in 2017 with the New Orleans Saints, had high praise for Webb.\n\"I can't fathom Sean Payton ever giving up play calling knowing how he operates,\" Daniel wrote. \"And that should tell you everything you need to know about Davis Webb.\"Payton said just as much. \"I would only do that [give up calling plays] if I felt like it would help our team,\" Payton said. \"I'll still be involved with what we do offensively, just like what we do defensively. But I do think [Webb] has a gift. He's real sharp. I'm glad he's on our staff. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The week of the NFL combine is when news starts to pick up again. It proves the NFL has no real offseason, and the closest thing to it is the two weeks between the Super Bowl and combine week.One of the biggest pieces of news was Tuesday's report from ESPN's Adam Schefter that Trent Williams and the 49ers are attempting to resolve their contract differences. Williams is set to count nearly $39 million against the cap in 2026, the 16th-highest figure in the NFL and the fourth-highest among non-quarterbacks, only behind Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones, 49ers defensive end Nick Bosa and Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson.The 49ers want Williams to return, and the player's representation and the team remain in contact. GM John Lynch said Tuesday, \"I think we're on the right track.\" Still, it's no guarantee.Williams is 37 and entering the final year of a three-year, $82.6 million deal he renegotiated ahead of the 2024 season. He remains one of the NFL's premier offensive linemen, making his 12th Pro Bowl and fifth All-Pro team last year. Pro Football Focus graded him as the No. 3 tackle in the NFL. He is integral to everything the 49ers do.\nIf he were to leave, he'd have ample suitors eagerly awaiting. Williams would have his pick, too. He'd be a free agent, and at this stage in his career, all that's missing among his many accolades is a Super Bowl ring. With that in mind, here are five spots he could land if he does indeed leave San Francisco.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Green Bay PackersThe Packers are set to let starting left Rasheed Walker leave in free agency. A former seventh-round pick, Walker has risen to become a solid if unspectacular left tackle, and he has not missed a game the last three seasons. He's in for a significant payday in a few weeks' time.Williams would represent a tremendous win-now upgrade for a win-now operation. The Packers have been among the league's youngest teams for multiple years, and while that core has emerged to form a contender, it's still missing a few true stars. Williams would be one. Last year, Walker was PFF's No. 53 tackle, and he committed nine penalties; Williams, again, was the No. 3 tackle, and he committed just four penalties.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago BearsGoing from one NFC North team to another, the Bears have already shown a willingness to take big swings on their offensive line. Last offseason -- their first under Ben Johnson -- Chicago traded for guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson and signed center Drew Dalman. Right tackle Darnell Wright has continued to improve.That leaves left tackle, where Braxton Jones entered the season as the starter but got hurt and was then benched and appeared in only six games. Ozzy Trapilo ruptured his patellar tendon in the playoffs and will likely miss most of the year. Johnson showed last year he isn't afraid to make bold moves to upgrade Caleb Williams' surroundings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysYes, the Cowboys being on this list is almost a given considering their propensity for being in the news, and, yes, they have massive financial hurdles to overcome. But with plenty of restructuring opportunities ahead -- most notably Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb -- they will work their way out of the financial hole they're currently in.\nNow for the fit. Left tackle Tyler Guyton, a 2024 first-round pick, struggled mightily in 2025 and has not inspired a ton of confidence through two seasons. Right tackle Terence Steele is a cut candidate. Add in that Williams is from Texas and, again, that the Cowboys are the Cowboys, and Dallas has to at least be on the radar, no matter how unlikely it may seem.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Steelers show no signs of entering a rebuild, even though Mike Tomlin resigned this offseason and the team's starting quarterback if the season started today would be Mason Rudolph or Will Howard. Should Aaron Rodgers return and reunite with Mike McCarthy, Pittsburgh would again look like a reasonably high-floor, low-ceiling outfit.Williams could elevate that ceiling. He's still a very good mover in space, something that would serve Pittsburgh well given Rodgers' propensity to get the ball out quickly to running backs and tight ends. Pittsburgh's current left tackle, 2023 first-round pick Broderick Jones, missed six games last year and has been inconsistent when on the field.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Wild card: New England Patriots\"He's 22 years old. He's our left tackle,\" Mike Vrabel said of Will Campbell in the aftermath of the rookie's difficult postseason. \"He'll get better and get stronger. Moments where he played well ... there's plays he'd like to have back, but we're not moving Will to center or guard or tight end or anywhere else.\"Indeed, Campbell's struggles were on full display, especially in the Super Bowl. But he was also playing at less than 100% after midseason knee surgery. The No. 4 overall pick less than a year ago, Campbell played at a very solid level prior to the injury. One bad postseason -- as a rookie coming off an injury, no less -- doesn't mean he's doomed.On the other hand, Vrabel's comments came before a player like Williams was potentially available. New England has plenty to do to ensure it's not a one-and-done Super Bowl contender, and upgrading other parts of the offense is high up on that list. But New England has the budget to go big-game hunting, and Williams is a massive talent at a crucial position.\n            ",

A multi-time winner, Chris Gotterup has jumped into a new echelon of golf. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler has kept up his torrid pace, while Justin Rose has continued to defy conventional wisdom at age 45. Collin Morikawa broke his winless drought, and Jacob Bridgeman became the year's initial first-time winner at the Genesis Invitational by holding off Rory McIlroy. But that was the West Coast Swing, and now, the PGA Tour transitions to Florida with the 2026 Cognizant Classic representing the start of four weeks of golf in the Sunshine State. While the names that were supposed to headline the field -- Bridgeman, Ben Griffin and Adam Scott -- bowed out earlier in the week, opportunity still comes knocking at PGA National.A life-changing moment could be in a young player's future as a wide-open field battles the Bear Trap, which has lost some of its teeth in recent times. With tournament officials choosing to overseed the golf course to provide lush fairways and green scenery, the bite that the venue was once known for has been taken away. Last season, for example, Jake Knapp fired a 59 on the par 71 while Joe Highsmith won the tournament at 19 under after making the cut on the number. The year prior, Austin Eckroat won on a Monday finish at 17 under, marking the first time since the tournament moved to PGA National that a winner eclipsed 15 under.\nThis season, good scores should be available once again as Shane Lowry leads a group of veteran players like Keith Mitchell and Brooks Koepka into the field. Meanwhile, young players like Rasmus Højgaard and his twin brother Nicolai look for their first wins on the PGA Tour alongside Michael Thorbjornsen, Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen and Haotong Li, who are also in the mix.2026 Cognizant Classic scheduleDates: Feb. 26 - Mar. 1Location: PGA National Resort (The Champion Course) — Palm Beach Gardens, FloridaPar: 71 | Yardage: 7,223 | Architect: Tom FazioPurse: $9,600,0002026 Cognizant Classic field, oddsOdds via FanDuel Sportsbook\nShane Lowry (14-1): Despite contending regularly on the PGA Tour, Lowry is without an individual victory on U.S. soil since the WGC Bridgestone Invitational in 2015 -- a tournament that no longer exists ...  heck, an event series that no longer exists! He had a great opportunity to get off the schneid in 2022 when he fell just short to Sepp Straka at this tournament, which kicked off a run of four straight top 11 finishes at PGA National. The Irishman has tasted contention in recent weeks, and he lost in Dubai last month due to untimely mistakes on the 72nd hole.Ryan Gerard (16-1)Nicolai Højgaard (22-1)Rasmus Højgaard (22-1)Michael Thorbjornsen (22-1): After nearly beating everyone at the WM Phoenix Open, Thorbjornsen got beaten by everyone at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. The young New Englander grabbed the solo lead late at TPC Scottsdale thanks to an eagle, but he then learned the hard way how difficult it is to close out a tournament on the PGA Tour and instead settled for a podium finish. He acquitted himself nicely at PGA National in his debut last season, where he was unable to find his groove on the greens.Keith Mitchell (27-1)Brooks Koepka (30-1): The Florida kid gets to play in his backyard once again. Nearly a winner at this event the year Mitchell holed a putt on the 72nd hole to hold off both Koepka and Rickie Fowler, Koepka returns this week to make his first start in the tournament since 2022, when he finished T16. The five-time major champion's return to the PGA Tour produced a couple of lackluster starts, but the bones of the operation were solid. Koepka kept up with his peers from tee to green only to be undone by his woeful performance on the greens. With the switch to Bermuda grass out in front of him and the rest of the PGA Tour, he should benefit.Christiaan Bezuidenhout (30-1)Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen (30-1): American golf fans, get used to hearing this name as the Rasmanian Devil continues to get his feet underneath him in his first PGA Tour season. The young Dane has only played twice on the PGA Tour in 2026 and made both cuts, but he should be frisky in a field of this caliber. Neergaard-Petersen won the Australian Open at Royal Melbourne to end 2025 and has continued to strike the ball beautifully in 2026.Aaron Rai (33-1): Was a surprise addition to the proceedings at the Genesis Invitational as Rai got off to a rocky start to his 2026 at venues that should fit his skillset (Waialae Country Club and Pebble Beach). Among the leaders early in the week, the Englishman unfortunately backtracked on Sunday at Riviera outside the top 25, but he showed enough promise to be feeling good heading into this week.2026 Cognizant Classic picks\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Ryan Gerard\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nWinner (16-1): He was the breakout candidate in the preseason predictions, and while Gotterup and Bridgeman may have the inside track on that award early, Gerard should give them a good push across the Florida events. Despite the lacking results to this point, the 26-year-old continued to strike the cover off the golf ball at Pebble Beach and Riviera, only to be undone on the greens. Local to these parts, Gerard will find his touch with the putter at PGA National where he has two finishes inside the top 25 in two appearances.\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                HaoTong Li\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nContender (45-1): One of the easier guys to root for on the PGA Tour, Li looked super comfortable in the early stretch of the season. He claimed a top 10 finish at the American Express before a T11 at the Farmers Insurance Open.

Still, he turned the corner at TPC Scottsdale, where his play was much better than what the result indicated.

    "body": "\n        As Tom Haberstroh recently noted, Cade Cunningham and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are the only current NBA MVP candidates on track to make the 65-game mark, which serves as the minimum threshold for eligibility. SGA is cutting it close. He's missed OKC's last seven games and nine overall, and is expected to miss at least three more. That would put him at 12 games missed, with 17 being the cutoff. Cunningham has only missed six. This may make him the favorite by default. Meanwhile, Nikola Jokić can only miss one more game before he becomes ineligible. Victor Wembanyama can only miss four more. Luka Dončić can miss five more, but for me, he's not even a top-five candidate at present (I know there will be some pushback on this, and I get it, we're splitting hairs here on a bunch of unbelievable players). At any rate, as long as you're mathematically eligible to win the award, you're eligible to make our rankings. So here they are, the top five MVP candidates as I see them standing (not necessarily how they rank in terms of winning odds) entering play on Tuesday, Feb. 24. 1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, ThunderMVP odds (via FanDuel): -145SGA was expected to return to the lineup following the All-Star break but that hasn't happened. He's missed nine games so far and is expected to miss at least three more before he returns from this abdominal strain -- which includes head-to-heads with his two closest MVP competitors in Nikola Jokić and Cade Cunningham. Bummer for us. Those games could've had an honest impact on voting if they swung one way considerably. \nAt any rate, when SGA returns he'll be at 12 games missed, at least. That would mean he can miss five more the rest of the season to make the 65-game threshold. Doable, of course. But it does put him in some danger of falling out with one more even marginally extended absence, particularly as Mark Daigneault has said he's not going to prioritize MVP eligibility over SGA's health and OKC's championship goal, as he shouldn't. All of that said, SGA remains the favorite to win his second straight MVP until further notice. If he gets it, he will enter rare air as just the 16th player in history to win multiple MVPs. His case is pretty iron clad. He was the MVP last season and he's been even better this season. He's shooting better from every spot on the floor, particularly from 3. He's the best mid-range shooter in the league. His FG%, 2-PT%, 3PT%, eFG% and TS% are all career highs. His 135.2 points per 100 possessions is seven points better than last season (per Cleaning the Glass), when he led the league in scoring. \nThis year he's second to Luka Dončić by exactly one point per game, but the efficiency isn't even close. The Thunder outscore opponents by 11.2 PPG when he's on the floor, and they're 9.3 points per 100 possessions worse when he's off the floor, per CTG. 2. Cade Cunningham, PistonsMVP odds: +600Cunningham was all but erased from Monday's marquee matchup against Spurs. From point to paint, the combination of Stephon Castle and Victor Wembanyama straight-jacketed him into a 5-for-26 dud that left Detroit without any source of offense whatsoever. And that's the MVP case right there: The Pistons have no repeatable way to put the ball in the basket other than Cunningham. When he goes to the bench, the offense goes from top-five to bottom-five, per CTG. \nEven with that defense (which he's also a big part of), and even in the Eastern Conference, the Pistons would be a play-in team, at best, without Cunningham. But with him, they are, and have been, going head to head with OKC for the best record in the league. Cunningham, Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic are the only players averaging at least 25 points and eight assists this season (Cunningham leads the league in points generated via assists, per PBP Stats). To me, the case for Cunningham over Doncic is clear. Cunningham plays both sides. The Pistons are a better team. If it's even an honest debate, that breaks the tie. It's a much tougher call against SGA, Jokic and Victor Wembanyama, all of whom are decidedly more efficient shooters and overall scorers that Cade, and they are leading arguably better teams. All three of those guys are better players than Cade, bottom line, but Cade has closed the gap in that regard to a point that circumstance can, and should, put him right in line with their MVP narratives. \nThree years ago, Detroit was the worst team in the league with just 17 wins. Two years they dropped to 14 and endured an NBA record 28-game losing streak. Then Cunningham leveled up. Last season, Detroit became the first team in history to triple its win total from the previous non-shortened season, and this year they have been the class of their conference basically from the jump. That is all disproportionately due to Cunningham, who on top of that has only missed six games this season. If the best ability is availability, Cunningham has been in the nightly grind more than any of these other guys, and even if a couple of them squeak past the 65-game threshold, he's on pace to play 73. That should be another in what is becoming a field of feathers in Cunningham's MVP-case cap. 3. Victor Wembanyama, SpursMVP odds: +2500I don't think a lot of people want to accept the Spurs as a true title contender this season. It still feels too early in the process. They were supposed to be one of those teams that would hopefully earn a playoff spot just for the experience. But they've blown past that projection. They're the West's No. 2 seed and they've beaten the No. 1 seed and defending champion Thunder four times. They're a top-tier contender, traditional timelines be damned, and it's because of Victor Wembanyama. \nDon't get me wrong, the Spurs are an excellent team on both ends independent of Wemby, but he's the one that changes the game to a degree that all traditional analysis has to be basically disregarded. It reminds me of the expedited emergence of the 2014-15 Warriors. That happened too quickly for a lot of people to accept, too, but then you looked up and they had won the whole damn thing. They had a great young team, just like the Spurs, but the start of that dynasty can be tracked directly to Stephen Curry, who geometrically warped the offensive end of the court to such a degree that nobody was equipped to defend it. Wemby does the same thing defensively, effectively shrinking the court to the same effect that Curry expands it. What has always been enough space to drive through or put up a shot in is no longer adequate as Wemby can erase 10 feet of separation like its five and spike what you thought was, and against any other opponent would be, a clean shot. That changes an entire offense. Causes more \"never mind\" retreats than we've ever seen. The paint is Cunnningham's office and he missed 13 of his 16 shots in there on Monday. A lot of it was the sheer presence of Wemby (not to mention Stephon Castle all over him, to the point that Detroit had to take Cade off the ball at the start of possessions to allow him to breathe) messing with his typical rhythms. That sixth sense guys like Cunningham have for their scoring spots gets jumbled to hell when Wemby is around, because you know he's always lurking to do this to you. \nAnd this, of course, is to say nothing of Wemby's offense. Over San Antonio's current nine-game winning streak he's averaging 24.9 points, 12 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 3.4 blocks and 1.3 steals a night. For the season, he's currently on track to become the only player in NBA history to average over 24 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks in less than 30 minutes per game. When this guy is playing potentially closer to 40 minutes in playoff games, yes, the Spurs have enough to win it all. I'm not saying they will. But they have enough. Wemby makes that big a difference -- 12.6 points per 100 possessions, per CTG, to be exact, even on a team with a bunch of other studs. It probably won't be enough to win him the MVP. For starters he's missed 13 games (the NBA Cup title game vs. the Knicks counts toward games played but not toward statistics, believe it or not), meaning he can only miss four more to even be eligible. \nBut I'll tell you what, if the Spurs jump the Thunder for the No. 1 seed (this is more than feasible with just two losses separating them and San Antonio owning the tiebreaker), given the impact Wemby is having, his case is going to have to be seriously considered. At any rate, for the time being at least, Wemby's impact is great enough to slot him higher than Jokić on my board due to the fact that he's far more likely to make the 65-game mark and his Spurs have been a better team. 4. Nikola Jokić, NuggetsMVP odds: +300Chances are he's not going to qualify. He can only miss one more game the rest of the season and Denver has four back-to-backs remaining, to say nothing of any little tweak. But until further notice, Jokić remains a top candidate for a Nuggets team declines by a whopping 16.5 points per 100 possessions when he isn't on the floor, per Cleaning the Glass. \nThat's the biggest on-off impact among any of the MVP candidates. The Nuggets literally go from an offensive rating that would rank, by an appreciable margin, as the best in NBA history with Jokic on the floor to right on the edge of a bottom-10 unit this season without him. He has a better No. 2 than Cunningham in Jamal Murray, but Denver and Detroit share a disproportionate dependence on their superstar, and in the end, Jokić is the best player in the world. His case, as it is every season, is airtight. He's averaging a triple-double and you've hardly noticed its so routine --  28.8 PPG on the best true-shooting percentage in the league. He's the league leader in assists and rebounds per game. He remains an advanced-metric god. But we're splitting hairs here, and he's missed a lot of time. If he cowboys up and doesn't miss a game the rest of the way, he's going to get a lot of votes. But right now, Cunningham has done enough for a top-seed team, and Wemby likewise for a higher-seeded team, to deserve an edge in my non-voter opinion. \n5. Jaylen Brown, CelticsMVP odds: +5000LeBron James said it after the Celtics -- led by Brown's 32 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and three steals -- dismantled the Lakers on Sunday: \"JB is playing great basketball, man. This whole MVP thing, I don't understand why his name is not getting talked about some, as well. Nobody gave them a shot to start the season. He's averaging, what, 30? Just under 30. It's a popularity contest sometimes.\"LeBron is spot on here. Brown is averaging 29.2 PPG, fourth-best in the league, and the Celtics that were supposed to be in a gap year are instead the East's No. 2 seed and a legitimate conference threat despite losing Jayson Tatum, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford and Kristaps Porziņģis from last year's squad. No other MVP candidate has endured that kind of roster depletion and still managed to keep his team in the title conversation. Brown has been an absolute killer. His efficiency doesn't jump off the page (for a while his midrange numbers were insane, but they've declined more into the still really freaking good category largely thanks to a 48% clip from the dreaded 15-19 foot rang, per NBA.com), but he's having to attempt so many tough, self created shots while also clocking a career high assist percentage that volume has to be noted positively for his case. Brown has never taken anything close to the 22 shots per game he's taking this season. That's by necessity. Long has the perception existed that Brown occupied the tier of star players below the super level, but that's been put to bed. Jaylen Brown is a superstar. No go-to guy has had more responsibility on his plate this year, perhaps other than Cunningham, and he has exceeded the responsibility in every way. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Atlanta Falcons will not allow former No. 4 overall pick Kyle Pitts to hit free agency, placing the franchise tag on their star tight end.  Atlanta made Pitts the first NFL player to receive the tag this offseason shortly after new Falcons coach Kevin Stefanski was asked about the former Pro Bowler during the NFL Combine. While he didn't specifically discuss Pitts, Stefanski stressed how much he values his position. \"I love the position. I coached it. It was my first position to coach on the offensive staff, was tight ends there with the Vikings under coach (Mike) Zimmer,\" Stefanski told the assembled media. \"I love the position because of the versatility that it provides an offense. And you've seen it around the league. This is nothing new or earth-shattering, but tight ends that can line up all over make life hard on a defense. Whether you can line them up outside, in the backfield, in line, you name it, we love versatility at that position.\"Obviously, Kyle's somebody that we'll talk at length more about when it comes to those types of roster conversations, but the position itself is something that we feel really very strongly about.\"\nIt was expected Atlanta would place the franchise tag on Pitts as it works towards a new deal. The Falcons have until July 15 to sign Pitts to a contract. If he were to play on the tag in 2026, Pitts would make a fully-guaranteed $16,007,000, according to Spotrac. The Falcons are expected to have $26,462,519 in cap space, which ranks No. 15 in the NFL per Over The Cap. Jones also mentioned the possibility of Pitts being tagged and traded if there was a suitor that offered enticing-enough compensation. Atlanta's first selection in this upcoming draft comes at No. 48 overall.\nPitts was considered to be one of the top tight ends set to hit free agency, headlining a list that includes Travis Kelce, David Njoku, Isaiah Likely, Dallas Goedert, Cade Otton and Chig Okonkwo. Pitts is coming off a career year in which he caught 88 passes for 928 yards and five touchdowns. He delivered what was the best outing of his NFL career during a Week 15 prime-time victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which he caught 11 of 12 targets from Kirk Cousins for 166 yards and three touchdowns. The Florida product made the Pro Bowl in 2021 after becoming the first rookie tight end to cross 1,000 yards receiving since Mike Ditka in 1961, and was named a Second Team All-Pro this past season. In 78 career games played, Pitts has caught 284 passes for 3,579 yards and 15 touchdowns. \nPitts was recently the second reported player to be in line to receive the franchise tag, joining Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens. Running back Breece Hall of the New York Jets is another player to watch with intentions to use a franchise or transition tag if a deal cannot be reached by March 3. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        An outstanding six-year run for left tackle Trent Williams with the San Francisco 49ers could be in danger of coming to an end. With Williams set to carry a $39 million cap number in 2026, he and the 49ers are engaged in talks but are struggling to find a contractual solution to the sizable impact he will have on the team's payroll next season, according to ESPN. If the sides cannot find a middle ground, Williams could become a free agent this offseason.The 49ers want to keep their star tackle in town despite the reported stalemate, according to CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones. John Lynch, the team's general manager, effectively said as much Tuesday at the NFL Combine.\"In recent weeks, I've met with both Trent and with his agent, Vincent Taylor, and had really good, productive and substantive meetings,\" Lynch said. \"Here's what I know. Trent loves being a Niner. We love having Trent as a Niner. It's up to us to figure that out and to thread that needle.\"There's some unique circumstances in that we all know what Trent is as a player and how great of a player he's been. He's gonna be 38 years old, so there's some things that go into that. But I think we're all on the same page and feel very positively about where that's going.\"\n        \n            \n                Trent Williams landing spots: 49ers star would have plenty of suitors from Super Bowl contenders\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA release before June 1 would save the 49ers $4.7 million in cap space. If they were to release him after that date, they would save $15.5 million this year -- though that would require them to split his dead cap hit across the 2026 and 2027 seasons.\nWilliams, a five-time All-Pro honoree and 12-time Pro Bowler, would be among the most highly sought-after players of the 2026 free agent class. Even entering his age-38 season, the veteran tackle remains a premier blind-side protector with potentially multiple more years left in the tank. He said last offseason that he would \"love to play until I'm 40.\"The 49ers and Williams agreed in September 2024 to a restructured three-year deal that made him the NFL's highest-paid offensive lineman that season.One of the few accolades that Williams has left to add to his résumé is Super Bowl champion. Remaining with the 49ers should allow him to achieve that goal, but his significant cap hit could also limit San Francisco's ability to surround him with enough talent to contend in a loaded NFC West. The 49ers secured a wild-card berth in 2025 despite finishing third in the division at 12-5. With two Super Bowl appearances and a pair of conference championship game berths since 2019, the 49ers are knocking on the door of a title. Losing one of the NFL's best tackles without getting anything in return would be a significant blow in that quest.\nWilliams joined the 49ers in 2020 via a trade with the Washington Commanders. The former No. 4 overall pick spent the first decade of his career in Washington and was a perennial Pro Bowler. He took his game to the next level upon arriving on the West Coast, securing three consecutive first-team All-Pro honors and a second-team selection in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami (Ohio) continued its storybook ride on Tuesday night, as the No. 21 RedHawks improved to 28-0 with a 74-64 win at Eastern Michigan. The win brought Miami within three victories of becoming the first Division I men's college basketball team to finish the regular season undefeated since Gonzaga went 24-0 during the COVID-impacted 2020-21 season. By contrast, Miami's regular-season slate features 31 games. While the RedHawks' schedule has been one of the easiest in college basketball, starting 28-0 is nonetheless a remarkable achievement. It's also a reflection of the program's steady rise under fourth-year coach Travis Steele. After finishing 12-20 and 6-12 in the MAC in 2022-23 during Steele's first season, the RedHawks have steadily improved in every season since. A year ago, they finished 25-9 and 14-4 in the MAC, suffering a devastating loss to Akron in the MAC Tournament title game. Steele managed to retain a significant chunk of last season's roster, which makes Miami a rarity in the mid-major ranks.  With continuity and experience in place, the RedHawks have navigated every challenge thus far. However, due to their poor schedule strength — the RedHawks haven't even played a Quad 1 game — their status in the NCAA Tournament field will be up for debate if they fail to win the MAC Tournament. \nThough Miami has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of its undefeated start. It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a WAB score of 2.16 as of Feb. 22, the RedHawks rank 35th in WAB and are recognized for having over two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.  Up next for Miami The remaining schedule for Miami which is trying to become the first team since Indiana accomplished the feat in the 1975-76 season. \nFridayat Western Michigan6 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkTuesdayvs. Toledo7 p.m. ESPN+March 6at Ohio7 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 12-14MAC Tournament (Cleveland)TBD If Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. Its current 35th ranking is within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty. Here are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.  NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami   The simple scenario (win MAC Tournament)  Record: Between 31-3 and 34-0  Confidence level: It's a party Likely WAB range: Doesn't matter \nBust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 3-0 to close the regular season, 0-0 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the RedHawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14.  Winning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The RedHawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams. Many of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the RedHawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007. \n The MAC Madness scenario Selection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1 Confidence level: Feeling optimistic Likely WAB range: 37-43 Miami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the RedHawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat. A loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the RedHawks  from the low-to-mid 30s in the metric to the low 40s. \nThe team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43. Finishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the RedHawks around or just below that figure, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.  Double-defeat scenario Selection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2 Confidence level: Feeling nervous Likely WAB range: 43-52 \nThe double-defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game.  This would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly. The team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally.  \nMiami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.  Three-loss scenario Selection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3 Confidence level: Better brace for disappointment Likely WAB range: 50-60 A 1-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the RedHawks  lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make.  \nWith three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the RedHawks  lost three times. \n            ",

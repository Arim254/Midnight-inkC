Yes finally.           </p><p>The values assigned to the players below reflect a long-term measurement of their Fantasy value. Values are determined by expected future performance, future schedule, and, most importantly, public sentiment. <strong>Past performance isn't a major factor in the Trade Chart. </strong>          </p><p>By adding two players' values, you could determine what one player you should be able to get in return. However, <strong>Fantasy managers should take off 10% of the value in any trade where one side has <em>two or more</em> players than the other</strong>. Also, a handful of others only carry legitimate value in two-QB or full-PPR leagues (and thus have no value listed in one-QB or non-PPR leagues).          </p>\n<p>This list also works as a \"rest of season\" rankings for the 2025 season.           </p><p>Finally, any player not on the chart should be considered valued at no more than four points. If you want to dive deeper before sending out or replying to trade offers, be sure to find my <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/all/articles/?authorId=3828\" target=\"_blank\">updated projected rest of season schedule rankings</a> available on SportsLine later this week.               </p>\n<p>You can reach out with any questions, disagreements, or reports of trades from your leagues to Dave Richard at <strong>drichard@cbs.com</strong> or at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daverichard\" target=\"_blank\">@daverichard on X</a>.                        </p><h3>          Running back          </h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>player</strong></td><td><strong>tm</strong></td><td><strong>non</strong></td><td><strong>0.5</strong></td><td><strong>PPR</strong></td></tr><tr><td>B.

Scott Wedgewood is 4-0 with a 1.00 GAA and .966 save percentage vs. LA over the last three years. Darcy Keumper is 1-2 with a 3.51 GAA and .871 save percentage vs. Colorado over that same time frame.

McGregor was suspended for missing three attempted biological sample collections in 2024.</p><p>Combat Sports Anti-Doping (CSAD) announced Tuesday that McGregor accepted the 18-month sanction for repeatedly failing to submit testing samples. Submitting samples is a requirement under UFC's in-house anti-doping program.</p><p>\"McGregor missed three attempted biological sample collections within a  12-month period in 2024, which constitutes a violation of the UFC  [anti-doping policy],\" CSAD officials <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ufc.com/news/conor-mcgregor-accepts-18-month-sanction-whereabouts-failures-under-ufc-anti-doping-policy\">wrote in a press release.</a>  \"UFC athletes are required to provide accurate whereabouts information  at all times, so they can be contacted and submit to biological sample  collections without prior warning. McGregor's missed tests occurred on June 13, September 19, and  September 20, 2024.\"</p><p>The CSAD noted that McGregor was injured and out of camp when the samples were supposed to be collected. The anti-doping body cut the standard suspension by a quarter, citing McGregor's cooperation and mitigating circumstances.</p>\n<p>\"McGregor  fully cooperated with CSAD's investigation, accepted responsibility,  and provided detailed information that CSAD determined contributed to  the missed tests,\" CSAD officials noted.</p><p>\"Despite  these mitigating factors, CSAD emphasizes that accurate whereabouts  filings and the ability to conduct unannounced testing are essential to  the success of the UFC ADP. Taking McGregor's cooperation and  circumstances into account, CSAD reduced the standard 24-month sanction  for three whereabouts failures by six months.\"</p><p>The suspension begins retroactively to the date of McGregor's most recent violation, Sept. 20, 2024. McGregor is eligible to compete after March 20, keeping alive his hopes to compete on the UFC White House card, which President Donald Trump <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/president-donald-trump-confirms-ufc-white-house-date-dana-white-denies-conor-mcgregor-is-booked/\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a></span> would take place on June 14.</p>\n<p>McGregor <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/conor-mcgregor-officially-returns-to-ufc-drug-testing-pool-in-potential-step-toward-comeback/\" target=\"_blank\">has submitted</a></span> four samples in 2025, according to <a href=\"https://ufcantidoping.com/tests?year=2025\" target=\"_blank\">UFC's anti-doping website</a>, a requirement for him to compete.

Both Brown and Espada were already under contract for next season anyway, so the assertion here is that both will get the chance to finish their contracts. </p><p>The Astros in 2025 finished 87-75, three games behind the AL West champion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Seattle Mariners</a>. The Astros built up a seven-game lead at one point and still were in first place as late as Sept. 17. They then lost six of their next seven games and were left on the outside looking in for the playoffs. </p><p>This marks the first time the Astros did not make the playoffs since 2016. There's a downward trajectory, too. From 2017-23, they made the ALCS every single year, winning four American League pennants and two World Series titles. They won 106 games in 2022, 90 in 2023, 88 in 2024 and 87 this season. </p>\n<p>This season was marred by injuries. Slugging DH <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507341/yordan-alvarez/\">Yordan Alvarez</a> only appeared in 48 games. Infielders Jeremy Peña and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910610/isaac-paredes/\">Isaac Paredes</a> both had productive years but also missed chunks of time. On the pitching side, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075773/spencer-arrighetti/\">Spencer Arrighetti</a> was held to seven starts and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2001084/lance-mccullers/\">Lance McCullers</a> Jr. made 13. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2910637/cristian-javier/\">Cristian Javier</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2862994/luis-garcia/\">Luis Garcia</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2932741/j-p-france/\">J.P. France</a> all missed most of the season while recovering from surgery from past years. Closer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044482/josh-hader/\">Josh Hader</a> spent time on the IL too.</p><p>Brown has his work cut out for him this coming offseason. The Astros need to figure out who they want to count on in the rotation, especially coming off all those injuries and with veteran lefty <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2739968/framber-valdez/\">Framber Valdez</a> hitting free agency. </p>\n<p>The bar is Houston was raised from 2017-24 and missing the playoffs is no longer acceptable. Brown and Espada survived one year of it, but all bets are off if it happens again in 2026.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Conor McGregor loudly campaigned, both through traditional media and online, that he'd compete on the White House card. McGregor's claims included a fight being signed and that he was directly negotiating with the White House. During Saturday's UFC 320 post-fight press conference, White denied McGregor's claims.</p><p>\"We have not started negotiating any fights for the White House yet,\" White <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YveG1eVDQI\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> reporters. \"That won't even start until February. I made it clear that Conor wants to fight on that card, and you can clearly  see Conor is very fired up to fight on that card, but nothing is done  yet. No fights are being negotiated with the White House.\"   </p>\n<p>White promised big things for the White House event, proclaiming it'll be \"the greatest fight card ever.\" However, the UFC CEO is focused on a worthy debut for <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-paramount-announce-landmark-media-rights-agreement-in-exclusive-partnership-nixing-ppv-model/\" target=\"_blank\">UFC's incoming exclusive media rights</a></span> deal with Paramount.</p><p>\"So  if you look at what we're looking down the barrel of right now, we're  about to go on a new network on Paramount and we need to deliver a  massive, incredible card in January,\" White said. \"Then  in February we'll start looking at building the White House, which I  will right now tell you will be the greatest fight card ever assembled  in the history of definitely this company.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, White revealed the promotion would spend <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/dana-white-says-ufc-will-spend-700000-on-grass-to-fix-the-south-lawn-after-event-at-white-house/\" target=\"_blank\">$700,000 on grass</a></span> to repair the damage UFC's production would cause to the South Lawn.</p>\n<p>\"There is no doubt about it, this is going to be the most challenging event we have ever done,\" White previously said.</p>\n            </div>",

The Tigers haven't won the World Series since 1984, while the Mariners are the only team in baseball to have never been to the World Series. <em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\">Bet Tigers vs. Mariners at FanDuel Sportsbook</a>, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:</em></p>\n<h2>Mariners vs. Tigers schedule</h2><table><tbody><tr><th><br />  </th><th>Date</th><th>Start time/score</th><th>TV</th><th>Live stream</th></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 1</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sat., Oct. 4</p></td><td><p>DET 3, SEA 2</p></td><td><p>FS1</p></td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Game 2</strong> \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t</p></td><td><p>Sun., Oct. 5</p></td><td><p>SEA 3, DET 2</p></td><td><p>FS1</p></td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 3</strong></td><td>Tues., Oct. 7</td><td>4:08 p.m. ET</td><td>FS1</td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 4 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Wed., Oct. 8</td><td>3:08 p.m. or 7:08 p.m. ET</td><td>FS1</td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Game 5 (if nec.)</strong></td><td>Fri., Oct. 10</td><td>4:40 p.m. or 8:08 p.m. ET</td><td>FS1 or Fox</td><td><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Mariners vs. Tigers: Game 3 info</h2><ul><li><strong>Time</strong>: 4:08 p.m. ET | <strong>Date</strong>: Tues., Oct. 7</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: Comerica Park -- Detroit</li><li><strong>TV channel</strong>: FS1 | <strong>Live stream</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=416484&sharedid=HTW\" target=\"_blank\">fubo</a> (Try for free)</li><li><strong>Starting pitchers</strong>: RHP Logan Gilbert (SEA) vs. RHP Jack Flaherty (DET)</li><li><strong>Odds</strong>: Tigers -154, Mariners +135</li></ul>\n<h2>Game 3 storylines</h2><p><strong>Tigers</strong>: The nature of MLB's playoff structure is that the inferior seed has to win at least one road game to advance. The Tigers did that, and now, with two home games ahead of them, they have a chance to punch a ticket to the next round without returning to Seattle.  </p><p><strong>Mariners</strong>: Baseball is a funny sport. The Mariners would've probably understood losing one of the first two games of this series coming in. But, because they were able to win Tarik Skubal's start, they can head into Game 3 with heightened spirits. The Mariners need only to split the two games in Detroit to force a return trip to Seattle.  </p>\n<h2>Game 3 prediction</h2><p>I had the Mariners taking this series, and it's in part because of how much I prefer their rotation to the non-Skubal portions of Detroit's. With that in mind, I think Gilbert will lift the Mariners over the Tigers. Let's call it a 4-1 Seattle win. <strong>Winner: Mariners</strong>. <em>- R.J.

Indiana was the surprise story of the 2024 season, ripping off 10 consecutive wins to start the Curt Cignetti tenure at a place known as a basketball-first school.</p><p>That 10-0 start included wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NEB/nebraska-cornhuskers/\">Nebraska</a>, but the critics painted Indiana as a paper tiger. That criticism only amplified when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a> beat Indiana, 38-15, and every flaw came under the microscope during playoff campaigning season. </p><p>Add in a 27-17 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a> in the CFP opener and it was easy to hand-wave Indiana away as a pretender. Few expected Indiana to be back in the playoff hunt again this season, an easy regression candidate for those who didn't believe in the Hoosiers' magical run a season ago.</p>\n<p>And, yet, No. 7 Indiana is very much in the hunt for a playoff spot midway through the season. The Hoosiers (5-0) have a chance to prove the criticism is outdated if they can get a challenging road win over No. 3 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a> this weekend (3:30 p.m. ET on CBS, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/watch/college-football/?ftag=CBS-03-10ada3a\" target=\"_blank\">CBSSports.com</a>, <a href=\"https://cbs-sports.app.link/Mleetu8HWsb\" target=\"_blank\">CBS Sports App</a>, <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/home/?cbscidmt=sports&ftag=PPM-22-10agi2j\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+ Premium</a>).</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/b1g-time-indiana-meets-oregon-for-early-leg-up-in-cfp-race-obvious-missing-link-limiting-penn-state/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>B1G Time: Indiana meets Oregon for early leg up in CFP race, obvious missing link limiting Penn State</p>\n                <p>\n                    Cody Nagel                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"B1G Time: Indiana meets Oregon for early leg up in CFP race, obvious missing link limiting Penn State\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/7e7acfd9-81fe-4383-9f3c-bca4e4797a2f/thumbnail/270x152/fbb66b017e36f1be892ff0abfbd38fd2/mendoza.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Inside the Indiana program, there is a strong belief that the Hoosiers can compete with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football's</a> elite teams. When reviewing last year's two losses, Indiana coaches were more encouraged than discouraged about where their program stood. </p><p>\"I still feel like I left both of those games thinking, 'Man, we weren't that far off,'\" defensive coordinator Bryant Haines told CBS Sports this offseason. \"I felt like the margin of error was just so small. I think we can compete with those teams and I thought we did compete well in moments. I think if anything, it validated us. We can beat Ohio State. I still think we can.\" </p>\n<p>The Notre Dame playoff loss was the tougher pill to swallow. Indiana gave up a 98-yard touchdown run to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133405/jeremiyah-love/\">Jeremiyah Love</a> early in the first quarter that immediately put it behind the eight-ball at Notre Dame. The offense that dominated the competition all season was stymied by Al Golden's defense. By the fourth quarter, it was 27-3 and the result was clear. Indiana made the final score a bit more respectable with two late touchdowns, but it crystallized to some that Indiana didn't belong. </p><p>That loss, of course, looked better as time went on as the Fighting Irish made it all the way to the national championship game with wins over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a>. Still, there was no getting around Indiana went 0-2 against the two best teams it played in 2024. There were lessons in those defeats, though. </p><p>\"Notre Dame I was really disappointed with the way we played but we learned what we needed, sort of personnel wise, to take the next step,\" Cignetti told CBS Sports this offseason. \"I think the positive thing about Notre Dame was a bitter taste left in everybody's mouths headed into this year. You didn't have those warm fuzzy feelings like you had a great year.\"</p>\n<p>Part of what Indiana needed was actually in that game on the opposing sideline. Offensive lineman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26713460/pat-coogan/\">Pat Coogan</a>, who has been the key cog to Indiana's O-line this season, started for Notre Dame in that game. In Indiana's hard-fought 20-15 win over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a> two weeks ago, Coogan had the best pass-blocking grade out of any Power Four center, according to Pro Football Focus. </p><figure><p><img alt=\"COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SEP 20 Illinois at Indiana\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/2a60b09f-b7f0-49cd-9748-854262bc7f03/resize/670x377/7d435e0706eea700c070db95ab2517da/coogan.jpg\" /></p><figcaption><span>Indiana center Pat Coogan (78), who transferred from Notre Dame in the offseason, has been among the Hoosiers' top impact newcomers of 2025. </span><span>\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            </span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not just Coogan who has elevated Indiana to another level this season. It's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CAL/california-golden-bears/\">California</a> transfer quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a>, who is an early Heisman Trophy candidate and has the Big Ten's best quarterback rating with 1,208 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and one interception. It's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MD/maryland-terrapins/\">Maryland</a> transfer running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26700412/roman-hemby/\">Roman Hemby</a>, who leads the team with 351 rushing yards. It's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MISS/ole-miss-rebels/\">Ole Miss</a> safety transfer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28901392/louis-moore/\">Louis Moore</a> who has a team-best 30 tackles so far. On both sides of the ball, Indiana made smart transfer additions to an already talented returning roster. </p><p>Indiana didn't just step up financially to improve its roster. The program fended off rival suitors for Haines and <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/indianas-fernando-mendoza-illinois-luke-altmyer-are-both-dynamic-qbs-meet-the-two-men-trying-to-stop-them/\" target=\"_blank\">made him one of the nation's highest-paid assistant coaches</a></span>. Cignetti engenders real loyalty from a staff that has followed him up the ranks, some all the way back to IUP, but it still takes real financial resources to keep that group intact. </p>\n<p>Under Cignetti, Indiana is all-in on football not only because the results are there on and off the field (ticket sales are up more than 50% year-over-year) but because it no longer feels farfetched that Indiana could compete for a national championship.</p><p>\"We believe in (his blueprint), he believes in it and we continue to work on it every day,\" Indiana AD Scott Dolson told CBS Sports. \"That's how we feel we'll have consistent success.\"</p><p>Saturday's road showdown against Oregon won't make or break this season for Indiana. The remainder of the schedule feels very manageable again, with the toughest tests likely coming against 4-1 Maryland and a 3-2 Penn State team that just lost to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UCLA/ucla-bruins/\">UCLA</a>. A loss Saturday and Indiana could be in the same boat as it was a year ago with a 11-1 record and criticism that it just beat up on lesser teams on the way to the playoffs.</p>\n<p>This team is more talented and better prepared than it was a year ago. It has a difficult road win over Iowa under its belt. The defense ranks top-10 nationally in scoring defense (No. 3), total defense (No. 5) and pass defense (No. 7). All of that will be put to the test against the Dante Moore-led Oregon offense that is averaging 46.6 points and 503.8 yards per game. The Ducks have the most talented roster Indiana has faced this season, one that Cignetti himself <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/the-race-to-keep-up-with-40-million-rosters-is-shaking-college-football/\" target=\"_blank\">told CBS Sports earlier this year </a></span>was in rarefied air of roster costs. The top end of the college football ecosystem were $40 million rosters, according to the coach. </p><p>When you play the game's top teams like Oregon, it is a \"game of inches,\" Haines says, \"and we have to win those inches.\" </p><p>Indiana will soon find out if its lessons from its losses a year ago will lead to the breakthrough its coaches believe possible, or instead have to suffer through the same narrative that hung over their success last season. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Hall of Famer Allen Iverson revealed that he has been sober for six months. While speaking to CBS News' Maurice DuBois for CBS Mornings about his upcoming memoir, \"Misunderstood,\" the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/PHI/philadelphia-76ers/\">Philadelphia 76ers</a> legend shared how important that decision has been for him.</p><p>\"One of my best decisions that I ever made in my life was to stop drinking,\" Iverson said.</p><p>When asked how he feels since making that decision six months ago, the 11-time All Star says he feels, \"Better than I did when I was doing it.\"</p><p>\"When you get drunk, you're not how you usually are,\" Iverson said. \"The more and more I see it on other people, the more and more it makes me happy about the decision. And the more and more I see how the people around me appreciate it, I love it.\"</p>\n<p>Iverson also shared the reasoning behind the decision to write a memoir, as well as why he titled it \"Misunderstood.\"</p>\n<p>\"With this book, you're hearing it from the horse's mouth,\" Iverson said. \"Misunderstood comes from, you think you know but you have no idea. There's a lot of things that people have said about me throughout my career. A lot of those things hurt. Calling me a thug, when I know I'm not. Judging me off of a look. I think that was one of the toughest things I really had to deal with.\"</p><p>During his Hall of Fame career, Iverson drew ire from the league office for the way he dressed when showing up to games. His style, which typically consisted of baggy jeans, oversized T-shirts and jerseys, chains and hats, was not the image former league commissioner David Stern wanted to promote. Ahead of the 2005-06 season, the league <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2194537\" target=\"_blank\">instituted a \"business casual\" dress code</a>, which explicitly stated that players could no longer wear things like chains, T-shirts and sunglasses indoors. Though Iverson was never publicly named as the reason for the dress code, it was apparent at the time that his style was what the league wanted to get rid of.</p><p>\"It was something that the NBA had never seen,\" Iverson said. \"We had never seen anybody coming in here dressing like this with the diamond chains, watches and cornrows. Right now, all of these guys in the NBA have their own unique personalities. And dressing means a lot to them. Now I get the flowers for it from them.\"</p>\n<p>Iverson became an icon for the way he played and for the way he transformed NBA fashion. He has been retired for 12 years, but his influence on players is still evident today, both on and off the court. </p>\n            </div>",

The trade came less than 24 hours after Bengals coach Zac Taylor had <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bengals-leave-door-open-for-possible-qb-change-what-that-means-trade-targets-and-who-could-take-over/\" target=\"_blank\">hinted that his team might be making a quarterback</a></span> change this week following <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180355/jake-brownings/\">Jake Browning's</a> three-interception performance during Sunday's 37-24 loss to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Detroit Lions</a>. </p><p>On the surface, it might seem like this trade doesn't make much sense. Flacco is 40 years old, he has zero mobility and he'll be asked to play behind a Bengals offensive line that opposing defenses have treated like a revolving door through the first five weeks of the season. Flacco has also thrown six interceptions this year, which is the third-most in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> behind only Browning (8) and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1700358/geno-smith/\">Geno Smith</a> (9). </p><p>So why would the Bengals make this deal? For one, it didn't cost them very much. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> are sending Flacco and a sixth-round pick to the Bengals in exchange for a fifth-round pick. </p><p> With that in mind, let's take a look at three more reasons why this trade makes sense. </p>\n<h2>Flacco can pick up a new offense quickly and he's familiar with the division</h2><p>One problem with adding a quarterback during the middle of the season is that they have to come in and learn a new offense in just days, which isn't easy to do, but Flacco has proven that's capable of pulling that off. The Bengals will be the fifth different team that Flacco has played for over the past six years. </p><p>In 2021, Flacco was part of a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-trade-veteran-joe-flacco-to-jets-for-conditional-2022-sixth-round-draft-pick/\" target=\"_blank\">midseason trade</a></span> that saw him sent from Philadelphia to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>. Flacco ended up making his first start with the Jets a few weeks after the trade and although New York ended up losing 24-17 to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a>, Flacco had an impressive performance, throwing for 291 yards and two touchdowns with zero interceptions. </p><p>In 2023, Flacco spent the first two months of the season on his couch as a free agent before the Browns signed him in November after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2133482/deshaun-watson/\">Deshaun Watson</a> suffered a season-ending injury. Flacco barely had two weeks to learn the offense before he was thrust into the starting job. The veteran QB ended up going 4-1 as the Browns' starter, and not only did he keep their season afloat, but he actually led them to the playoffs. If Flacco can come anywhere close to replicating what he did in 2023, then he could certainly save the Bengals' season. </p>\n<p>That's two situations where Flacco had to quickly learn an offense and he ended up playing pretty well both times. No matter what happens with Flacco, it definitely feels like he's an upgrade over Jake Browning. </p><p>Flacco will also give Taylor a chance to add a missing wrinkle to the offense. Taylor's offense was designed for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2179798/joe-burrow/\">Joe Burrow</a>, so almost everything is run out of shotgun, but with Flacco running the show, you can bet he'll be lining up under center, which will bring play-action football back to Cincinnati. </p><p>Sure, there were other quarterbacks out there -- like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272242/russell-wilson/\">Russell Wilson</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1998197/jameis-winston/\">Jameis Winston</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1272574/kirk-cousins/\">Kirk Cousins</a> --  but if Flacco had one advantage over any other option, it's the fact that he knows the AFC North so well. The veteran has spent 13 of his 18 seasons playing in the AFC North, so he certainly knows what he'll be up against this season.</p>\n<p>That familiarity could come into play as soon as this week. The Bengals are playing the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> on Sunday and although they're not in the AFC North, Flacco has already faced them, and beat them. </p><h2>Flacco will be throwing to one of the best receiving tandems in the NFL</h2><p>Playing behind the Bengals offensive line could get ugly, but Flacco can negate that problem if he can get the ball out quickly. The Bengals have one of the best receiving duos in the NFL in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2966320/jamarr-chase/\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809208/tee-higgins/\">Tee Higgins</a>, and Flacco has shown throughout his career that he can get the ball where it needs to go. The 40-year-old will need to get the ball out quickly and that will be much easier to do if his receivers are getting open, and both Higgins and Chase have shown this year that they can get open. The problem is that Browning wasn't able to consistently get them the ball. </p><p>In Cleveland, Flacco did throw six interceptions this year, but his top two wide receivers were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2741201/jerry-jeudy/\">Jerry Jeudy</a> and an undrafted free agent (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28910521/isaiah-bond/\">Isaiah Bond</a>). Going from Jeudy and Bond to Chase and Higgins is like going from a mini-van to a Ferrari. If Flacco can quickly learn how to drive the Ferrari, the Bengals could be in good shape. </p>\n<h2>The Bengals are very much alive in the AFC</h2><p>The final reason why this deal makes sense is because the Bengals had to do SOMETHING to save their season. At 2-3, the Bengals are sitting in second place in the AFC North and just one game out of a wild-card spot in the AFC.</p><p>With the AFC North in total disarray this year, the Bengals simply couldn't afford to throw the season away with bad QB play. It just takes one look around the division to realize how winnable it is this year; The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/BAL/baltimore-ravens/\">Ravens</a> have more problems than the Bengals, the Browns are the Browns and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a> haven't been exactly overpowering their opponents during their 3-1 start. </p><p>Here's a look at the current AFC North standings: <br /><strong>1. </strong>Steelers (3-1)<br /><strong>2. </strong>Bengals (2-3)<br /><strong>3. </strong>Ravens (1-4)<br /><strong>4. </strong>Browns (1-4)</p>\n<p>The Bengals actually play the Steelers on Thursday night in Week 7 and if they were to win that game, that would put them right back in the thick of the AFC North race. Guess who has won 11 career games against the Steelers? Joe Flacco. </p><p>Taylor is very well aware of the state of the division and the AFC overall, which is likely why the Bengals were so willing to bring in a new QB. </p><p>\"I'm not oblivious to what goes on in the AFC and our division,\" Taylor said Sunday. \"There's going to be plenty of opportunity there if we can stick through this storm and stick together and find a way to put us in some better positions on offense together and score some points.\"</p>\n<p>With Joe Burrow possibly coming back in mid-December, they just need Flacco to keep the season afloat and he could do that by going just 5-4 in Cincinnati's next nine games. If Flacco pulled that off, the Bengals would be 7-7 with a possible Burrow return coming around Week 16. </p><p>There's always a chance that this trade ends up going down as a disaster, but the Bengals should get some credit for even making it happen. This is a team that HATES making midseason trades -- Flacco is just the third player they've acquired midseason over the past 52 years -- but they knew they had to do something to try and save their season and that's what they're doing here. </p>\n            </div>",

The team is signing veteran and one-time Colt Michael Badgley, <a href=\"https://x.com/TomPelissero/status/1975628579527664063\" target=\"_blank\">according to NFL Media</a>. Badgley, 30, hasn't played in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> since he tore his hamstring last summer. Prior to getting injured, he was enjoying a successful run with the Lions that included making each of his three field goal attempts during Detroit's 2023 playoff run. </p><p>Badgley played for five franchises since he broke into the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in 2018. After spending his first three seasons with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAC/los-angeles-chargers/\">Chargers</a>, Badgley played for four teams over the next two seasons that included 12 games with the Colts during the 2021 season. Badgley played well during his first go-around in Indianapolis as he made 85.7% of his field goal attempts and each of his 39 point-after tries. </p><p>After just one game with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DET/detroit-lions/\">Lions</a>, Badgley spent the majority of the 2022 season with the Lions, where he made 83.% of his field goal and all 33 of his point-after attempts. </p><p>Badgley spent the majority of the 2023 season on Detroit's practice squad before he was called upon to replace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865368/riley-patterson/\">Riley Patterson</a> late in the season. Badgley delivered as he made each of his seven field goal attempts that included a game-winning, 54-yard field goal against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/LAR/los-angeles-rams/\">Rams</a> in the wild-card round that sealed the Lions first playoff victory in 32 years. </p>\n<p>Badgley is now called upon to replace Shrader, who recently earned AFC Special Teams Player of the Month prior to suffering his season-ending injury.

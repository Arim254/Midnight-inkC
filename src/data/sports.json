    "body": "\n        STORRS, Conn. -- In the past 30 years, only three teams have opened a season with at least three of their first five wins against top-15-ranked opponents, with all of those victories coming away from home.• 2001-02 Arizona• 2020-21 GonzagaAnd?These Arizona Wildcats. Tommy Lloyd's fourth-ranked team joined the rarified list Wednesday night after maneuvering past third-ranked UConn 71-67. The Wildcats won the first game between two top-five teams at Gampel Pavilion since No. 3 Connecticut beat No. 2 Villanova 89-75 on Feb. 26, 2006. The win was also Arizona's first vs. in a top-five matchup since the 2001 Final Four against Michigan State.No coach ever has to apologize for any kind of road conquest against a power-conference program, but it's worth immediately noting that the Wildcats did get the benefit of catching the Huskies shorthanded. In addition to waiting just a bit longer for the collegiate debut of former five-star prospect Braylon Mullins, Dan Hurley's team had to go without one of the better big men in the country, senior Tarris Reed Jr., who sat due to an ankle injury he suffered in the Huskies' win vs. BYU on Saturday in Boston. Reed, whose 20.0 points per game leads the team, is the only player through the first two and a half weeks of the season averaging at least 20.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 2.0 blocks. His scratch took Arizona by surprise. Wildcats senior guard Jaden Bradley told me he didn't realize they weren't going to have to face Reed until he saw the big man wasn't going through pre-game warmups. \n\"Don't take them lightly,\" Bradley said to his teammates. \"They're still a really good team.\" What ensued was an Arizona rebounding ruckus, the likes of which is almost never possible against UConn. \"We know that changes the game,\" Lloyd said of Reed's sit-out. \"But if you get a good hop, field it, turn two.\" \nThe Wildcats overpowered the Huskies, snagging 43 boards to Connecticut's 23. That prowess around the rim was pivotal to earning the upset, because for as good as Arizona is in so many facets, it is not a reliable group from the perimeter. Somehow, for the second time this season, Arizona beat a team ranked No. 3 while hitting fewer than five 3-pointers; the Wildcats also did it on opening night against Florida. 'Zona's physicality was the factor in getting this win and lifting the team's profile to the top of college basketball. The Wildcats held Connecticut senior star forward Alex Karaban to eight points, 10.3 below his average entering the night. After junior sniper Solo Ball hit some inspiring shots early, Lloyd's crew mostly muted the shooting guard's impact in the second half. \"We got punked,\" Hurley said. \"It's going to be a bad film session coming out of here. There's a street fight going on in the paint and, you know, men can't watch fights. You can't stand on the outside when your buddies are in a fight. You get in the fight. You don't stand on the periphery of the fight.\"\nThe Gampel Pavilion crowd was nevertheless invested all night, hitting a deafening din when UConn overcame a 13-point deficit to go up 62-60 at the 3-minute mark on a Jaylin Stewart broken-play layup. \"I told my guys before the game, it's our first road test,\" Bradley told CBS Sports. \"California, it's probably a split crowd. Florida, we probably have more fans there in Vegas. This is our first away-game crowd. They hit one shot, it felt like they hit five.\"Bradley's up-and-under to make it 67-64 (after patiently working his way to the low block) with 16.3 seconds remaining was the latest in a growing highlight reel of clutch, heady play for one of the best guards in college basketball. \n\"When you have a point guard who's selfless, and also baller, and has the cojones to make and take that at the end of a game, it's pretty special,\" Lloyd said. \nThey were selling $2 Miller Lites all night long, and the lines flowed into the concourse. By the end of the night, a top-five billing met the moment. \"I'd love to see what this place is on $1 beer night,\" Lloyd said afterward. He was all smiles, and he should be. Because what Arizona has done is the most impressive thing in college hoops through the first 17 days of the season. It began with a head-turning 93-87 win over No. 3 Florida in the opener in Las Vegas. Then, last Friday, a 69-65 come-from-behind twister over classic rival, No. 15 UCLA. \nBut to travel across the country and step into UConn's home dome and control most of the game to get a third top-15 win?This is the No. 1 team in college basketball. Whether it's the best is up for debate, because college hoops has been blessed with a litany of really good teams for this 2025-26 campaign.There is no argument over the best résumé, however. Arizona clears all, for now, with ease.\nOf his many great traits as a coach, one of Tommy Lloyd's best is he schedules in a way that benefits Arizona while uplifting college basketball. The fact he desires the big game has to have something to do with why he's so good at winning them.Arizona has 16 wins in games away from home vs. ranked teams since Lloyd got to Tucson in 2021. A real wow: Arizona's win over UConn was Lloyd's 25th vs. a ranked opponents, which gives him the second-most wins over ranked teams in the first five seasons of a coaching career in the past 30 years. Only Tom Izzo's 31 from the start of his tenure in 1995 has more.\nLloyd has scheduled home-and-homes with Duke, UConn and Auburn. Give it some time -- there will be more in the years to come -- in addition to the variety of creative neutral-site battles Arizona will reliably be a part of so long as Lloyd is running the show.Even without a Final Four on his résumé (yet), Lloyd has built up a reputation as one of the best coaches in college basketball because he's hunted these kinds of games. He's now 7-4 in matchups where both teams are ranked in the top five. By winning two games vs. top-three teams just five results in, this Arizona team tied a school record for most in one season ... and we still have four-plus months to go. \"When you get opportunities like this, give yourself a chance and take advantage,\" Lloyd told CBS Sports. \"Maybe that is the magic. That we understand the moment, but we want to really try to approach it like any other game. We're not scared of these things, and honestly, we're not scared of losing these things. You know what I mean? Because we understand that's part and parcel of this deal.\"\nMaking it even more impressive: Arizona starts three freshmen (Koa Peat, Brayden Burries, Ivan Kharchenkov), who are far from playing at the peak of their powers. Bradley is the rock and 7-foot-2 leviathan Motiejus Krivas is a load, but the roster blend here is impressive. The team is averaging more than 25 bench points per game, making the Wildcats one of the deeper teams in the country. But it all starts with Bradley. Arizona is the No. 1 team in college basketball -- or at least should be when the polls refresh next Monday -- because it has an unflappable senior who, stunningly, wasn't even voted to the Big 12's preseason 10-man First Team list. It was an egregious oversight, to say the least.\"I don't think JB gets enough credit for his work and how much he's improved,\" Lloyd told CBS Sports. \"And that's not to say that he wasn't always really good, but he's really worked on his game and honed his game and fixed some weaknesses and accentuated some strengths. He just has a quiet confidence and belief in himself that rubs off on his teammates. Just really special.\" \nThis team could be a special one as well, though Lloyd wasn't even flirting with letting the win inflate the team's ego, or his own.\"Florida could have gone another direction. The UCLA game could have gone in another direction, so let's not think we've got all the world's problems solved,\" Lloyd said. \"This win here isn't going to mean we're going to be a great team in January or February.\"But it is a great indication that Arizona will be. And having Bradley as the leader is important. Last season, Arizona got off to a 4-5 start against tough competition before finding its groove in January. Last season's team got a 4-seed and lost in the Sweet 16 against the monster Duke squad led by Cooper Flagg. This Arizona group is better. Three wins vs. probable good NCAA Tournament seeds outside your home state is as strong of a predictive indicator as there is.\"It's a long season. We've been harping on our guys: keep building,\" Bradley said. \"I was a part of the team last year, we didn't have a great start to the year. That's hanging in the back of my head.\"The season is a long race, and we're not even at the quarter-pole yet, but everyone's chasing the Wildcats for now. No one's looked stronger, and the tantalizing part is, this team can still get a lot better between now and March.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The National Women's Soccer League has its first-ever back-to-back MVP winner. Kansas City Current forward Temwa Chawinga was awarded 2025 NWSL MVP on Wednesday through a tiered voting process that included players, coaches and executives, media, and fans. She is only the second player to win two NWSL MVP awards.The Malawi international was up against four other candidates, including club teammate Bia Zaneratto. Only Sam Kerr has won two MVP awards, in separate years, along with Golden Boot and best XI honors. Chawinga led the league in scoring with 15 goals in 23 regular-season appearances, and six of her goals were game-winners, matching a record she set last season. Chawinga walked away on the night with three individual awards: MVP, 2025 Golden Boot, and a spot on the NWSL's Best XI. She received them during NWSL Championship week in a special event at the San Jose Civic Center. It's the first-ever NWSL formal awards show and ceremony in its 13-year history. The MVP winner told the media after the ceremony that her favorite goal scored this year was her header goal, which was her first header scored in NWSL, and that winning this year feels different with the added special event.\"We didn't have an event like this. Just sent an email. And last season was like, I didn't know anything. I just came here like \"Okay, we'll see what type of players [and they're] great players. So, I'm so grateful that [media] chose me.

Oladotun chose Maryland over Georgetown, Kentucky and Arkansas.\"The relationship I built with coach Buzz Williams and the entire coaching staff was really crucial to me,\" he said during his announcement aired live on his YouTube channel. \"They took the time to get to know me and my entire family.\"Oladotun's said his two older sisters go to Maryland so the chance to be close to family -- and close to home as a Maryland native -- was for him a place that offered \"so many opportunities.\" He added his trainers and his entire support system are also there.\nOladotun was originally in the 2027 class and ranked as the No. 1 player before reclassifying in August. 247Sports ranks him as the No. 3 small forward in the class. 247Sports' Director of Scouting, Adam Finkelstein, said this of him this summer after the reclassification. He has been highly productive on the Nike EYBL circuit playing for Team Durant.\nOladotun is a late-blooming jumbo wing, who has continued to grow throughout his high school years and now stands at 6-foot-10 with a 7-foot-1 wingspan. He's still physically undeveloped with a lean frame, boxy shoulders, and high center of gravity, but isn't apprehensive to play through contact and only going to keep getting better as he grows into his body.His game, like his frame, is still a work-in-progress, but loaded with long-term potential. It's the vast scope of his versatile tools that is perhaps most compelling. He's already a threat to make plays as a handler, shoot over top of contesting defenders, or take smaller defenders into the mid-post. He tends to be a bit upright, but he has good hands and is very comfortable with his dribble. He made just 28% of his threes and 63% of his free-throws in EYBL play, and has an elbow that can fly out on his way up into his release, but still soft natural shooting touch to develop.Where he really excels is with his footwork. It comes out in the mid-post area, but even more so at the end of his drives. He has an instinctive ability to navigate the lane in ways that can't be taught, with a full repertoire of maneuvers after he picks up his dribble. He decelerates well, utilizes euros, but also knows when to elongate his strides. He'll even mix in pro-hops, spins, fake-spins, and step-throughs. He's a solid athlete, who can jump off either one foot or two, and can cover ground as more of a long-jumper, but it's really the footwork between his last dribble and before his finish that is so elite.The addition of Oladotun gives Maryland the No. 3-ranked class in the 247Sports Team Rankings behind only Michigan State and Kansas. He joins a class that also includes four-star recruits Kaden House and Adama Tambedou as well as three-star wing Austin Brown.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Texans are coming off their second straight victory, a 16-13 win against division rival Tennessee Titans, while the Bills emerged on the right side of a 44-32 shootout with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It will be Davis Mills under center again for the Texans, as C.J. Stroud will miss a second straight start due to his concussion. Mills is 2-0 this season as a starter and is averaging 283 passing yards per game. He's scored four total touchdowns, thrown one interception, but also been sacked six times in those contests. The Bills got back to their winning ways last week in a game that featured nine lead changes, but they are still 1.5 games behind the surprising New England Patriots in the AFC East. Between facing a backup quarterback and a bottom-10 rushing attack, this is a big opportunity for Buffalo. \nLet's break down this week's edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" but first, here's how you can watch the game. Where to watch Bills vs. Texans liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 20 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: NRG Stadium -- Houston, TexasStream: PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -5.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel)Bills vs. Texans: Need to knowDavis Mills struggled in his one start vs. Buffalo. While Mills has been winning as of late, his one career start vs. the Bills back in 2021 was a disaster. He completed 11 of 21 passes for 87 yards, zero touchdowns and a career-high four interceptions in a 40-0 loss. Josh Allen has bad luck in Houston. Allen has an 83-37 record as a starter in the regular season, but he's had bad luck in H-Town. The Bills have lost on walk-off field goals in Houston twice when Allen has started.Bills run defense is an issue. The Bills have the No. 2 pass defense in the NFL, allowing 169.7 yards per game. However, the run defense is a major problem. Buffalo allows the second-most rushing yards per game with 153.0, and has allowed six rushing touchdowns of 30 or more yards this season -- which are tied for the most through 10 games in NFL history.Best defense in the NFL? Many believe the Denver Broncos have the best defense in the NFL, but that title may belong to the Texans. Houston allows a league-low 258.1 total yards per game, and are the stingiest when it comes to putting points on the board at 16.3 per game. And that 16.3 is the fewest allowed through 10 games by a team without a winning record since 2003! Houston has allowed fewer than 20 points in seven of 10 games this season.Not-ready-for-prime-time players? The Bills are 2-2 in prime time this season, but have lost their last two night games. The Texans on the other hand have lost both of their prime-time matchups this year. Bills vs. Texans prediction, pick\nAllen may not love playing in Houston, but he certainly likes playing on Thursdays. Allen has the best Thursday record (8-0) by a starting quarterback since 1950. He's scored 290 total touchdowns in his career, which are the most all-time by a player 30-years-old or younger, and has the most total touchdowns in the NFL this season with 28. All that to say, he's good enough to rise above this vaunted Texans defense. \nThe Texans mounted an impressive comeback against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 10 and found a way to win in Tennessee last Sunday despite not scoring a single point in the first half, but the Bills are a different kind of test. Buffalo covers the spread in prime time. Pick: Bills -5.5; Under 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

On Wednesday, FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the charges against Wedding, and the FBI is offering $15 million for information that leads to Wedding's arrest.Earlier this year, the FBI added Wedding to its Ten Most Wanted list and initially offered $10 million for information on his whereabouts. On Wednesday, Bondi called the former snowboarder \"one of the most prolific and violent drug trafficking organizers in the world,\" according to USA Today.Wedding, 44, is accused of trafficking drugs, primarily cocaine and fentanyl, between Mexico, the United States and Canada. Bondi stated that Wedding is the largest distributor of cocaine in his native country of Canada as he imports 60 metric tons of the drug from Mexico into the U.S. every year for a billion-dollar operation.\n        \n            \n                Ryan Wedding, ex-Olympic snowboarder, added to FBI's Ten Most Wanted amid drug trafficking, murder accusations\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBondi also alleged that Wedding is aided by the Mexican Sinola cartel, which is protecting him as the FBI continues its search.\nWedding is accused of killing a U.S. federal witness in Colombia. Authorities say the witness was murdered before he was able to testify against Wedding, and a $2 million reward is being offered for more information about the witness' murder. Prior to the witness' death, law enforcement recovered $15.2 million between physical assets and cryptocurrency.Here is the complete list of charges against Wedding, per USA Today.Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaineConspiracy to export cocaineConspiracy to commit murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crimeMurder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crimeConspiracy to tamper with a witness, victim, or informantTampering with a witness, victim, or informantConspiracy to retaliate against a witness, victim, or informantRetaliation against a witness, victim, or informantConspiracy to launder monetary instrumentsWedding allegedly has a lengthy list of aliases. Among them are \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" 'Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King.\"\nAt the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Wedding competed for Canada in men's parallel giant slalom. He placed 24th in the event.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        If you're looking for fantasy basketball value, all-around producers averaging 10+ points, 5+ rebounds, and 5+ assists offer it in bunches. These versatile players boost multiple fantasy basketball categories simultaneously, making them ideal targets for your NBA fantasy team. With NBA depth charts constantly shifting due to NBA injuries and lineup changes, monitoring these triple-threat contributors provides a strategic edge in both category and points leagues.Veteran All-Around Fantasy OptionsRussell Westbrook has played more than 20 minutes in 11 of his 14 appearances this season, with the first two games of the season accounting for two of the three outings where he played less than 20. He also came off the bench for three straight games before seeing his first start of the campaign, but since then, he has started in eight of 11 games. In his third game of the year, he dropped 18 points, six rebounds and six assists, which was the first real flash of what he has been able to deliver for the Kings. He is up to three double-doubles and two triple-doubles, while averaging 14.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.0 steals on the season, showing he is still one of the best all-around contributors in the game. In his 17th NBA season, James Harden stands out as the most steady and effective contributor on his team, while injuries continue to take a toll on his most highly-rated teammates. He remains one of the league's best offensive talents, averaging 26.2 points per game, while shooting an average of 37.6 percent from deep and 92.2 percent from the foul line. His ability to shine as a distributor has elevated his game for years, and he is on pace to average over eight assists per game for the eighth time in his career. Meanwhile, he has averaged over 5.0 rebounds for 12 straight seasons, but his 6.3 rebounds per game this season is his most since 2021-22. Draymond Green is certainly not off to his best start, shooting just 39.1 percent from the field and 58.8 percent from the foul line. However, he continues to do a great job chipping in across the board, most notably by racking up assists with his high-IQ playmaking, a trait he has displayed for most of his career. While his 7.9 points and 5.8 rebounds are average for his position at best, his 5.7 assists per game are what set him apart from the bunch. The Warriors are a long way from their championship days, but Green still has his main target, Stephen Curry, who has surely been the one to finish many of the plays that led to assists for the big man. It is also likely that Green rediscovers his touch from the foul line, as this is the first time in his career that he is shooting below 65.0 percent from the stripe.  \nStat Stuffers of the FutureLuka Doncic continues to dominate the stat sheet. Leading with an incredible scoring touch and excellent passing. He also does a great job using his 6-foot-6 build to take his production to another level with impressive rebounding. Doncic is shooting 47.2 percent from the field through 11 appearances this season, and he is also averaging a career-best 1.9 steals per game. He is the type of player that could likely put up numbers on any team, but he is surrounded by a strong unit with the Lakers, where Austin Reaves provides great support to help relieve the pressure in the backcourt, while Deandre Ayton, and now, LeBron James, who just made his season debut, are ideal targets to feed for easy buckets in the frontcourt.  Jaime Jaquez turned heads with a hot start to the season, averaging 17.1 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.1 assists in 30.3 minutes per game, exclusively out of a bench role. His production shows a major leap over his sophomore season, which was slightly underwhelming compared to his rookie year. Nonetheless, he is reaching new heights in his third campaign, including shooting a career-best 52.8 percent from the field. With his 6-foot-6 frame and passing ability, Jaquez has all the tools to continue to make an impact across the stat sheet. In the past, he has had trouble maintaining significant playingtime, but injuries in the Heat's lineup have allowed him to enjoy a worry-free start. On the other hand, Tyler Herro is on track to return to action in the next few weeks, which could cut into Jaquez's time, especially if he falls into any kind of slump.  Amen Thompson is averaging more than four assists per game for the first time in his three seasons. He is putting up career highs of 17.3 points and 5.2 assists per game, and he continues to make an impact on the glass with 6.1 rebounds per game despite working within a lineup filled with players that attack the boards. With the absence of Fred VanVleet, Thompson has been handling the starting point-guard job for the Rockets, which is proving to be an area that he is more than capable of managing and is surely contributing to his new levels of success. His shooting percentages have taken a slight dip compared to last season, but at 22 years old, he is more than likely to continue to develop his game in a positive direction, which would have him on track to be one of the league's best producers.  \nScottie Barnes is off to a dominant start, standing out as one of the league's most well-rounded volume contributors, averaging 19.4 points, 7.7 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.8 blocks, with just 1.9 turnovers in 32.7 minutes per game. He is surrounded by strong offensive players in the Raptors' lineup, but his skillset remains unique thanks to a great ability to battle and score in the paint. He is also shooting career-bests 50.2 percent from the field and 81.3 percent from the foul line, indicating that he is using more discretion and refining his approach with experience. Additionally, his size and determination make him a legitimate defensive force and suggest that he will continue to round out his production with contributions on both ends of the floor. Dyson Daniels has shown a significant drop in his points per game, going from 14.1 last season, down to 8.9 this season. However, he is also averaging career highs of 5.9 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game, as he has done a great job stepping up as a distributor in the absence of Trae Young. Daniels made a splash last season with his uncanny defensive ability, racking up a whopping 3.0 steals per game, and he is keeping up the good work on that end with 2.3 steals per game this season. However, he is shooting just 61.9 percent from the foul line, where he has yet to shoot better than 65.0 percent in his career, and he is shooting a career-low 23.1 percent from deep. Looking ahead, his assist numbers may take a hit when Young returns, which could make a notable impact on his overall productivity, especially if he does not get his shooting on track. Alperen Sengun has shown for a few seasons now that he is a certified stat-sheet stuffer, and he is at it again, averaging 23.0 points along with career highs of 10.3 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. His ability to show improvement nearly across the board is a testament to his own work ethic but also an indication that the arrival of Kevin Durant, and the current composition of the lineup is working in his favor. His dexterity, vision, and timing are rare skills at the center position, mirrored by only a few players, including Nikola Jokic, and Domantas Sabonis. These are skills that will ensure Sengun stays at the heart of the action and has a good chance of picking up stats on virtually every possession. \nOther players averaging at least 10.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists (these players have been highlighted within one of my previous three weekly articles):Nikola Jokic, Cade Cunningham, Josh Giddey, Jrue Holiday, Austin Reaves, Stephon Castle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jalen Johnson, Jamal Murray, Julius Randle.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The long-awaited College Sports Commission participation agreement, viewed as a critical piece for the future of college sports, was sent out Wednesday to the Power Four conference schools.  It has been months in the making and delayed, in part, over disagreements on what a penalty structure should look like. The hope is that all of the Power Four schools will sign it and turn it back in within the next two weeks, a critical time period with the early signing period starting Dec. 3 and the transfer portal window opening Jan. 2.The 11-page participation agreement obtained by CBS Sports allows the CSC to enforce agreed upon rules, prevents schools from circumventing the system to sue over enforcement decisions they didn't like (long a problem in the NCAA enforcement model) and requires annual audits of all schools that spent 75 percent or more of the annual rev-share number, among other measures. Notably, it states that it does not override existing state laws.The piece most critical to CSC CEO Bryan Seeley and his team would prevent schools from pursuing jury trials outside of the CSC enforcement and appeal process. There are arbitration opportunities for the schools and student-athletes, but ultimately every participating school will be bound by the final decisions made. Led by Seely, the CSC was created to enforce revenue-sharing and NIL-related issues in the aftermath of the landmark passing of the $2.8 billion House settlement. \nThe document states that if any participant (student-athlete, school or associated entities or state officials) brings any suit or claim against the CSC related to membership rules, investigation or enforcement actions, it would \"forgo and not receive any and all revenue from its conference and not be eligible to compete in the post-season in the sport(s) involved in the investigation or decision.\"Conference commissioners, athletic directors and others hope all 68 Power 4 schools will sign off on the agreement and bring stability to a landscape where litigation -- or the threat of it -- has made it nearly impossible for the NCAA to enforce rules, from NIL to eligibility and everything in between.Once the agreements are signed, Seely and his team will have the runway to crank up the enforcement efforts and prevent salary cap circumvention, among other issues. Currently, every school that opts into the House settlement is able to spend up to $20.5 million annually on direct payments to student-athletes. \nAhead of the House settlement, many programs turned to a popular strategy known as \"front-loading,\" spending as much of their NIL dollars as possible before entering a world where every deal of $600 or more must be submitted to and reviewed by the NIL Go clearinghouse. With the CSC unable to enforce its rules so far, some within the industry have discussed continuing to spend significant NIL \"pay-for-play\" money without making it subject to NIL Go's fair-market-value review.There must be a compelling reason for everyone -- from schools to their most active boosters -- to follow the rules, and an enforceable penalty structure is one way to provide it.The penalties available to the CSC were not detailed in the agreement sent to schools on Wednesday, but they are expected to be finalized soon and codified as NCAA bylaws. One holdup in the participant agreement, sources told CBS Sports, was hesitation within the Big Ten to endorse postseason bans as a potential punishment. After months of discussion, the four power conferences ultimately agreed after limiting the circumstances of a possible postseason ban to: the most egregious violations, disregarding penalties and purposefully obstructing and/or not cooperating with investigations. \nAccording to those familiar with the expected structure, penalties could include a limited postseason ban, financial penalties for schools and individuals, restrictions on the number of transfers a program can take and more. One particularly notable consequence expected to be included is a reduction in how much revenue-share money a school can allocate to a specific team. The CSC cannot reduce the overall $20.5 million cap, but if violations are deemed severe, it could restrict a football program to, for example, 20% of the cap instead of the 75–80% most Power Four schools currently spend.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        New York Jets cornerback Kris Boyd, 29, was upgraded to stable condition Wednesday after he was shot in the abdomen early Sunday morning in New York. Boyd was previously listed in critical but stable condition, police said. CBS News reported Monday that a bullet was lodged in Boyd's lung and he underwent surgery.Boyd posted on his Instagram story on Wednesday that he was starting to breathe on his own.\"I'm sorry I have no words at the moment,\" Boyd wrote. \"Just grateful! I'm coming along, starting to breathe on my own now. Sincerely appreciate everyone!\"Jets coach Aaron Glenn addressed the incident for the first time on Wednesday and said Boyd is in good spirits.\n\"That's what eases my mind is that he's in good spirits,\" Glenn said. \"His wife and his kid, they're in good spirits and he'll walk away from this just fine.\"The investigation is ongoing after NYPD received a 911 call on Sunday at 2:09 a.m. ET. On Monday, the police released images of a potential suspect wanted in connection with the shooting. Boyd was with a group on West 38th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway when an argument took place with another group. Boyd was then hit by gunfire. Police released surveillance footage and pictures of the person of interest in the shooting, but no arrests have been made.\n\"We are aware of the situation involving Kris Boyd and will have no further comment at this time,\" a Jets spokesperson told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. The NFL did not offer further comment, telling CBS Sports it has been in contact with the franchise.Boyd has not suited up for the Jets this season. He was placed on injured reserve in August after suffering a shoulder injury during a team scrimmage.Several players reacted to the frightening news on Sunday, including Jets defensive end Jermaine Johnson II:\n\"It's tough news to hear,\" Jets tight end Jeremy Ruckert said on Monday. \"You know, one of our guys, and you know we're all thinking of him and wishing him well, and his family. So other than that, we're going to keep everything in-house about what's going on. Just thinking of him and his family.\"Boyd, who played his college football at the University of Texas, was originally a seventh-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings in 2019, also playing for the Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans. Boyd has spent most of his NFL career on special teams, racking up 105 tackles, three pass defenses and two forced fumbles in 81 career games. The Jets did not play on Sunday after falling to the New England Patriots on Thursday night, 27-14. They will face the Baltimore Ravens on the road in Week 12. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin's career has transformed into a reality show, a soap opera packed with so many twists and turns that forecasting the next move for the hottest coach in college football is a fool's errand.Whether he stays at Ole Miss or bolts for Florida or LSU is anyone's guess. No. 6 Ole Miss (10-1) is on the cusp of its first-ever College Football Playoff, and yet the coach who has led the Rebels to unprecedented success -- three consecutive 10-win seasons -- seems unfazed by the frenzy he helped spark in Oxford. As speculation of his interest -- or lack thereof -- in Florida and LSU's job openings spread, the coach again refused to tip his hand Wednesday.\"I'm saying the same thing for six years,\" Kiffin said on an SEC teleconference. \"I'm not talking about speaking on other jobs. I'm focused on this one.\"\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss wants clarity from Lane Kiffin. He's not in a position to give it. What's next?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's true that Kiffin has not left Oxford, working in his office at the Manning Center and leading practices during an open week. His family, however, has not stayed put. His ex-wife, Layla, and other family members flew to Gainesville, Florida on Sunday to visit the city, sources told CBS Sports, and on Monday they caught another flight to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nOn Wednesday, Kiffin didn't advance the plot, but he he absolutely stirred the pot. When asked if he felt flattered that three SEC schools are pursuing him as head coach, he responded: \"It doesn't feel good on this call.\"Somehow it's got spun really negatively. I said it before: if programs want your coach, that should be looked at as an amazing thing and a great thing by your fans. So if programs want your coach because you're 10-1 and whatever -- three 10-win seasons in a row, which has never been done in Ole Miss before -- is that a good thing that other programs want your coach because your program's experienced success it's never had? Or would you rather be 5-6 or 6-5 or something right now and no one wants your coach? I would look at it from that perspective.\"The administration understands exactly what's at stake. Gratitude for historic success doesn't erase urgency, and Ole Miss officials hope to secure a commitment from Kiffin by week's end, sources told CBS Sports. The Rebels begin preparations Sunday for the regular-season finale against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl.\nAthletics director Keith Carter and Kiffin's representatives have been negotiating for more than three weeks, with sources describing late-October conversations -- soon after Florida fired Billy Napier -- as \"positive.\" But that was nearly a month ago, a lifetime in the wild world of college athletics.\"Keith and I have a great relationship. We communicate daily on a lot of things and I love it here,\" Kiffin said. \"it's been amazing. We're in the season that's the greatest run in the history of Ole Miss at this point, having never been at this point. So I think it's really exciting. I think Saturday night (against Florida) was amazing.\"I'm just living in the moment -- it's amazing -- and our players are too. I see their joy about the practice season, where they're at and have so much on the line. It's just awesome to be a part of.\"\nEven so, Kiffin sounded flummoxed when asked by a reporter whether he would coach the Rebels in the Egg Bowl, and fired back with rhetorical questions on Wednesday.\"Do I expect to coach next week?\" he said. \"Why would I not expect to coach next week? I mean, I expected to coach against Florida (last week), too. So I don't even understand the question of how I would not expect to coach next week. Why would I be at work?\"But a clock is still ticking. If he intends to accept a rival SEC job, it's hard to imagine him staying on to shepherd Ole Miss through a playoff run. In that scenario, the Rebels would need a postseason contingency plan for an interim coach. Defensive coordinator Pete Golding and quarterbacks coach Joe Judge would be considered, sources said.\nCBS Sports asked Kiffin outright whether he might take another job before the postseason begins.\"I'm not speaking on other jobs,\" he responded.And so the carousel spins, with three SEC fan bases twisting in the wind.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks are a franchise in turmoil after firing general manager Nico Harrison as the team failed to live up to his vision following the disastrous trade sending Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. With Harrison gone, the Mavs desperately need to create a new vision for the team that they can sell to fans, and the obvious way to do so is to shift the focus to the future and build around No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg. To do so, they will need to unload high-priced veterans, most notably the centerpiece of the return for Dončić, Anthony Davis. Ever since Harrison was fired, the expectation has been that Davis' days in Dallas are numbered, and on Wednesday we got our first strongly reported confirmation of that from ESPN's Tim MacMahon. MacMahon cites multiple team sources who said the team will \"explore the trade market\" for Davis ahead of the February deadline. However, minority owner Mark Cuban (once the team's majority owner) told The Athletic that the Mavs would not be trading Davis, saying simply, \"We won't. We want to try to win.\" \nThat call won't be Cuban's to make alone, as he does not have final say in personnel decisions anymore but does have considerably more input now than he did under Harrison's front office -- as evidenced by him being blindsided by the Dončić trade like everyone else. Cuban is now serving as an adviser to majority owner Patrick Dumont as part of a committee that is leading the Mavericks' basketball operations division after Harrison's ouster. \n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis trade rumors: Ranking every NBA team as a possible landing spot for Mavericks' star big man\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt would make sense for the Mavericks to state publicly their intentions to keep Davis while still exploring the market for him. If the rest of the league believes Dallas is in a hurry to move off of Davis, they'll struggle to field strong offers. The biggest challenge in moving Davis was already going to be that there is no chance they get back anything close to what they gave up to bring him to Dallas. At this point it seems like they are treating the Dončić trade as a sunk cost. That can't be the bar a Davis trade is held to, and if they go in with a realistic expectation, then a deal could get done. Even so, they'll want to maximize their return and that means doing their best to negotiate from a place of strength rather than apparent desperation.\nEven being more realistic, the Mavs will need Davis to eventually return to the floor and play like the All-Star caliber center he long has been. His latest calf strain has forced him to be held out for multiple weeks. And given his injury history, teams acquiring the 32-year-old will have their concerns about giving up a haul to bring him in given the injury risk. As for which teams could be interested in Davis, if the Warriors are serious about going all-in on trying to win another title with Stephen Curry, they have a glaring need for frontcourt reinforcements to aid Curry and Jimmy Butler. Davis would give them another high-end veteran to chase another title, and Dallas could finally be a landing spot for Jonathan Kuminga, giving him a fresh start on a team with a more future-facing timeline alongside Flagg. If Davis is on the market, it's fair to wonder if we'll be headed down a mini-fire sale route in Dallas come February. They could look to sell off a number of their veteran pieces, like PJ Washington, Daniel Gafford and Klay Thompson, not to mention Kyrie Irving, who is hoping to return to the court at some point this season. It might be difficult maximizing return for Irving if he hasn't played before the deadline, but he could certainly be on the table this summer if they want to fully shift focus to a youth movement around Flagg. \nEverything will be on the table now that Harrison is gone. The first order of business for many would be finding a way to undo as much of the Dončić trade as possible by trading Davis, but the team is, at least publicly, insisting they aren't ready to hit the reset button just yet. \n            ",

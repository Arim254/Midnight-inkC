    "body": "\n        YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) -- Xander Schauffele picked up another meaningful win in Japan, this one a PGA Tour trophy instead of Olympic gold, capping a frustrated year marked by injury and some doubt.Schauffele birdied the 17th hole Sunday and closed with a 7-under 64 to hold off Max Greyserman and win the Baycurrent Classic. It caps off a season that saw him miss two months with a rib injury and fail to reach the Tour Championship for the first time.\"This is really special for me -- sooner than I thought, to be fair,\" Schauffele said. \"I was running out of events in 2025 to sort of put my mark on it. I'm sure when I look back on 2025 at the end of my career I'll smile and think it was a great year.\"It was a great year off the course -- his wife gave birth to their first child, Victor, in late August. But it was a struggle to regain his form after missing two months at the start of the year, coming off a season when he won the PGA Championship and British Open.\nAnd it was only fitting that he won in Japan, where his mother and mother-in-law were raised.Schauffele finished at 19-under 265 at Yokohama Country Club and was one shot ahead of American Max Greyserman, who also was the runner-up at this event a year ago as he chases his first PGA Tour title.Greyserman (65) fell two shots behind when Schauffele birdied the 17th hole. Needing to hole out from 190 yards to have any chance, Greyserman hit 7-iron that settled a few inches from the cup and left him a tap-in birdie.\nSchauffele's biggest win in Japan was the Olympic gold medal in 2021, though he had no support in the gallery because of the COVID-19 restrictions.His maternal grandparents live in Japan. His mother was born in Taiwan and grew up in Japan. His wife's mother grew up in Japan's southern island of Okinawa.\"I've been coming here since I was about 9 years old to visit my grandparents,\" Schauffele said. \"I sort of fell in love with this country a long time ago. I can't wait to bring my son here when he's old enough to sort of understand and appreciate the culture here in Japan.\"\n\"Yeah, the ties run deep for the Schauffele family here in Japan,\" he added.Schauffele and his wife, Maya, became parents a little over six weeks ago.\"It's still kind of fresh, but it's definitely a cool thing being a dad and I'm so excited to go home to him and Maya after this,\" Schauffele said.Schauffele was cheered during the tournament by family members who attended, including his 81-year-old grandmother who walked the course with him. He said there would probably be a get-together with family members later to celebrate.\"I mean, I don't get to see them very often and they've always been gracious with their time to come out wherever the event was,\" he said. \"They've been awesome to me and this is pretty cool. I've really wanted to share a win with them, so can't wait to get together with them.\"\nGreyserman held or shared the lead through the first three rounds. Michael Thorbjornsen finished with a 64 and was three strokes behind the winner.Soft conditions and very little wind led to low scoring. American Matt McCarty shot an 11-under 60 -- with a lost tee shot on his final hole -- and still finished nine strokes back. Japanese Takumi Kanaya finished with a 9-under 62 and was five behind with winner.McCarty had a chance at a 58 but hit into the trees on his final hole and settled for a bogey and a 60. Jim Furyk holds the PGA Tour record with a 58 in the final round of the Travelers Championship in 2016.\n            ",

The Steelers ruled out All-Pro special teams standout Miles Killebrew for the remainder of the game after he sustained a knee injury late in the first half. Killebrew's knee appeared to give out against a blocker during a kickoff. He immediately grabbed his knee before being treated to on the field by Pittsburgh's medical staff. He was then helped off the field before quickly being ruled out for the remainder of the game. A defensive back, Killebrew is one of the NFL's best special teams gunners. He earned All-Pro honors in 2023 and made his second consecutive Pro Bowl in 2024. \nWith Killebrew out, the rest of the Steelers' special teams regulars will have to pick up the slack. Fortunately for Pittsburgh, it has several other notable special teams players that includes safety Jabrill Peppers and running back Kenneth Gainwell, who had a big forced fumble on special teams that led to a score during the Steelers' Week 1 win over the Jets. \n            \n    ",

After quarterback Anthony Richardson reportedly hurt his eye while stretching with a resistance band, cornerback Charvarius Ward suffered a concussion when he collided with a teammate. Ward was not wearing a helmet or pads. Here's footage of the incident:\nRichardson was already backing up Daniel Jones, and his injury resulted in Riley Leonard being elevated to the No. 2 quarterback spot. Ward is a more significant loss from an on-field perspective. He has been the team's top cornerback, and it's a position that's already shorthanded: Kenny Moore has not played since Week 3 due to an Achilles injury, and the team also has Justin Walley and Jaylon Jones on IR. Veteran cornerback Xavien Howard abruptly retired at the beginning of the month, and practice squad cornerback Mike Hilton (shoulder) is also injured.\nWard, 29, also missed Indianapolis' Week 2 win over the Broncos with a concussion. Overall, though, he has been outstanding for the 4-1 Colts after signing a three-year, $60 million deal this offseason. He is currently Pro Football Focus' third-highest graded cornerback.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Trent Bray will not finish his second season atop the Oregon State football program. The Beavers fired their head coach and defensive coordinator on Sunday, ending Bray's brief stint in charge amid an 0-7 start to a miserable season. It was somewhat of a bold move for a program that often gives coaches long leashes -- especially given Bray's deep ties to Corvallis as a former star Oregon State linebacker and his willingness last year to step into the role at a pivotal time for the program. But it also had to happen.The collapse of the old Pac-12 hit Oregon State hard, and Bray took it upon himself to clean up the mess. He faced an uphill battle from the start. Not only did the Beavers face a mass exodus of star players, a dismal financial outlook and a relegation from the Power Four structure, but they also had to overcome the departure of a rising star on the sideline in former coach Jonathan Smith.Smith bolted from his alma mater to take the Michigan State coaching job, leaving behind a pile of rubble for his old defensive coordinator to clean up. In hindsight, the move was catastrophic for both sides. Smith's struggles with the Spartans have those in East Lansing facing possible buyer's remorse, and his exit from Oregon State put Bray and the Beavers in the deepest of holes.Many around Corvallis were willing to give Bray a long runway. His predecessor needed time to pull the Beavers out of a quagmire during his tenure, and there was little chance that Bray, a first-time head coach, would be able to overcome unprecedented adversity in short order. Frankly, that athletic director Scott Barnes pulled the plug before Bray could even fire offensive coordinator Ryan Gunderson, is a surprise. He gave Smith more leeway than that, after all. And the offense was the Beavers' most glaring weakness this season.\n\n        \n            \n                College football winners, losers in Week 7: Indiana serves notice in Big Ten, Penn State's slide continues\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPerhaps it was as clear internally as it was externally that Bray was simply not cut out to be a head coach. He has a track record as a prolific defensive coordinator but made it clear during his DC days that he was content in his role and did not have head coaching aspirations. He took over the defensive play calling duties this season in a return to his more natural role and was coy about how much he actually enjoyed being a head coach. At times in his short tenure, he seemed in over his head.Perhaps, also, this is the beginning of the end for those in leadership positions at Oregon State. It may be a last-ditch effort for Barnes to save his job. In fact, calls for his firing were louder in recent weeks than calls for Bray's ouster. Perceived mismanagement of the school's NIL operations, a spotty history with coaching hires and questionable handling of the Pac-12 situation put Barnes on shaky ground in the eyes of Oregon State faithful.At the end of the day, things are rotten in Corvallis. Whether or not Bray's firing is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to athletic department upheaval, change had to occur in short order. Oregon State cannot take an ailing football program and a downtrodden athletic department into the new-look Pac-12 next season.\nOregon State has the rich athletics history, recent across-the-board success, funding and fanbase passion necessary to thrive in the rebuilt conference. It should regularly compete for championships in numerous sports and has the upside to perennially hang in the upper tier of Group of Six football at large. Think about it; this is a power conference school in a non-power conference.But instead of using its two years in purgatory to build towards that future, Oregon State fell further into the abyss.The coaching change will set the Beavers back further, at least through the end of the season. With the right hire, however, it could be the kind of move that gets them back on the rails after the train wreck that was the last two years.\n            ",

Few programs felt that pain more than Michigan, which dropped to 4-2 on the season in its 31-17 loss at USC. The Wolverines also dropped out of the AP Top 25 poll for the first time this season, as they are now 1-2 against Power Four conference opponents with a record above .500. Sherrone Moore is also just 11-7 in his 18 games as Michigan's coach. As a result of Saturday's clash between Michigan and USC, the Trojans climbed back into the AP poll at No. 20. This is their second time in the top 25 this season, as they spent one week ranked before their Sept. 27 loss to Illinois. USC coach Lincoln Riley hopes it sticks this time around. The Big Ten fallout continued with Indiana jumping all the way up to No. 3 by beating Oregon. And the Hoosiers landed multiple first-place votes, too. A pair of Big 12 teams in Arizona State and Iowa State also plummeted out of the rankings after their respective road losses to unranked programs. Though Oklahoma wasn't a true road team in its Red River showdown against Texas, the Sooners also fell prey to a Longhorn team that previously sat outside the top 25. \nTexas climbed all the way back to No. 21 after beating its top rival for the third time in the last four seasons. Below is the full AP Top 25 poll for Week 8.

    "body": "\n        The Blue Jays have turned a season that began with skepticism into one that's made believers. For much of the past five years, Toronto has shown more promise than product. The club's had elite talent but could never sustain consistent winning. Now, they're a favorite to win the American League Championship Series over the Mariners. The product is finally living up to the promise.The team, of course, is led by Vladimir Guerrero Jr., one of the most dynamic offensive players on the planet. But, more importantly, this is a club that is spearheaded by one unified formula: put the ball in play. The Blue Jays posted an 80.6% contact rate this season, the highest in the majors. Their 9.4 percent whiff rate was the second lowest in baseball. They also thrived with runners in scoring position, hitting .292 -- the best mark in the league. That approach carried into the postseason, where they went 15-for-37 in the ALDS against the Yankees.\"We make a lot of contact,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said after his team's series win against the Yankees last week. \"That's been evident throughout the year. Guys have a plan when they go up there, and we try to utilize everyone's skill set to the best that we can.\" \nThey've turned players like Ernie Clement into unlikely postseason stars, as he went 9-for-14 in the series against New York, one of the best pitching staffs in baseball. They've also helped revive veterans like George Springer, who delivered his best season since 2019 at age 35. And they've done it all without Bo Bichette, still sidelined with a knee injury suffered late in the season.They'll have to do it without Bichette again in the ALCS, as he was left off the roster, a daunting challenge given Seattle's deep and dominant pitching staff.Defensively, Toronto is among the best teams in the majors. They ranked fourth in defensive runs saved, showing stellar play across the diamond. Outfielder Daulton Varsho has established himself as a Gold Glove-caliber defender, covering gaps with ease on balls that would likely drop for doubles if it weren't him -- or players like Pete Crow-Armstrong of the Cubs or Ceddanne Rafaela of the Red Sox -- patrolling the grass.\nBut what does this all mean against this Seattle team? Notice we haven't mentioned pitching, and that's because it leaves a lot to be desired. It could be what ultimately does the Blue Jays in this series. For all their offensive and defensive strengths, Toronto simply doesn't have much pitching depth. Even in their four-game win over the Yankees, the staff allowed a combined 14 runs in Games 2 and 3. The team enters the series without a true front-line starter. Max Scherzer, added to the roster for this round, is well past his prime, and Chris Bassitt has been dealing with a lower back issue that's kept him out since late September. Even when healthy, Bassitt isn't a true No. 1. Neither are Kevin Gausman or Shane Bieber, which leaves Toronto without a clear ace to anchor its rotation. Could that be Trey Yesavage, the rookie who made just three major-league starts before his playoff debut? Maybe. He dominated the Yankees in Game 2 of the ALDS, striking out 11 in 5 ⅓ no-hit innings, but it's hard to put such high expectations on a guy this early in his career.If they want to win this series they will have to outslug the Mariners, who are also known for their power. The team's offense is led by Cal Raleigh, who launched 60, and Eugenio Suarez, who compiled 49 homers on the year. Furthermore, Seattle features one of the best pitching staffs in all of baseball, led by Logan Gilbert, George Kirby, Luis Castillo and Bryan Woo. Although Woo missed the ALDS due to right pectoral inflammation, he too was added to the roster for this series. The Mariners are optimistic that he will be ready by the middle part of the series. \"But I think kind of how Seattle is playing now, yeah, way different from the last time we saw them for sure,\" Schneider said. \"Whether it's how the bullpen is used, some guys they've added offensively, some guys that have stepped up offensively. They're a really good team. They're a good team for a lot of different reasons.\n\"They're a team we've kind of been looking at for a while hoping we'd be in the position that we are and kind of thinking it's a pretty good likelihood that they're going to be here, too.\"The Blue Jays are a good team, too, finally reaching their peak. \n            ",

The Colts' backup quarterback injured his eye while doing band work, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.  Following the game, Colts coach Shane Steichen told reporters that Richardson suffered an orbital fracture, forcing him to spend Sunday's game in a local hospital. The injury allegedly occurred as a result of a malfunction of the elastic band he had been using.Richardson's role as backup to Daniel Jones went to rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard, who will remain the Colts' QB2 while Richardson recovers. Per Steichen, there is currently no timeline for Richardson's return.\nLeonard -- who last year helped lead Notre Dame to an appearance in the College Football Playoff National Championship -- played well during the preseason. He started and played the entirety of the Colts' preseason finale against the Bengals, going 15 of 20 for 189 yards that included a 59-yard touchdown pass to wideout Laquon Treadwell. \nA former first-round pick, Richardson lost his starting job to Jones prior to the start of the regular season. During his first two seasons with the Colts, Richardson went 8-7 as the team's starter but threw more interceptions (13) than touchdown passes (11) over that span; injuries and erratic play largely told the story of his first two NFL seasons. \nA fellow former first-round pick, Jones has enjoyed a career rebirth this season with the Colts, who continued their hot start by improving to 5-1 with a 31-27 win over Arizona.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Chiefs and Lions go head-to-head in Week 6 Sunday Night Football in a matchup that was a popular preseason NFL futures bet for the 2026 Super Bowl matchup. Kansas City and Detroit finished as the top seeds in their conferences last season, and although Kansas City reached the Super Bowl, the Chiefs couldn't capture another Lombardi Trophy. Despite Kansas City being off to a 2-3 start, this still has the potential to be a Super Bowl preview with both teams near the top of the odds boards for Super Bowl betting. But before then, they have the highest over/under of any game on the Week 6 NFL schedule heading into their Sunday Night Football matchup, which signals plenty of potential for winning anytime touchdown scorer bets.The SportsLine model expects both offenses to perform well, with an under-the-radar wide receiver as one of its top Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer picks. The model projects value in Chiefs receiver Tyquan Thornton, who has scored a touchdown in three of his last four games, to find the end zone at +300 odds at FanDuel for online sports betting. Lions star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is also one of the model's top picks for Week 6 Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown bets. St. Brown's over/under for total receptions against Kansas City is 6.5.Before making any Lions vs. Chiefs picks or anytime touchdown scorer props at sportsbooks, be sure to see the Week 6 NFL predictions from SportsLine's proven model and see the latest NFL odds. They can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest Fanatics Sportsbook promo code, which allows new users to bet $50 and get $250 in FanCash. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model is on a sizzling 41-21 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, the model has revealed its top Lions vs. Chiefs anytime TD scorer prop picks for Sunday Night Football: Best Week 6 Chiefs vs. Lions anytime TD prop picks:Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions (+105)Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+140)Tyquan Thornton, Chiefs (+300)Parlay these picks for +1450 odds with a Caesars Sportsbook promo code (odds subject to change). New users receive 20 100% sportsbook profit boosts with a $1 bet with the promo code CBS20X.Amon-Ra St. Brown, Lions (+105)Brown had eight receptions for 100 yards last week against the Bengals, but he was held out of the end zone for the first time since Week 1. The Lions receiver had six touchdowns over a three-game span as he remains as important to the Lions offense as any non-quarterback in the NFL is to their team's offensive success. St. Brown has at least seven receptions in each of his last four games, and has secured 31 of 35 targets (88.6%) during that span with an elite chemistry with Jared Goff. St. Brown is the only player in the league with six receiving touchdowns this season, and the model likes his chances of adding to that total on Sunday Night Football. DraftKings is offering St. Brown to score a touchdown at +105 odds, and with the latest DraftKings promo code, new users receive $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+140)Hunt had two touchdowns last week against the Jaguars with a 5-yard run and a 2-yard run as the Chiefs' go-to runner near the goal line. Although Hunt played only 21 snaps compared to Isiah Pacheco's 40 snaps, they were the important snaps for finding the end zone. Hunt is the only Kansas City running back with a rushing touchdown this season (he has three). Hunt has played at least 33% of snaps in all five games this season in a split backfield, and the model gives him the best chances of all Kansas City players to score a touchdown on Sunday Night Football. FanDuel offers Hunt at +140 odds as an anytime touchdown scorer, and with the latest FanDuel promo code, new users receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.Tyquan Thornton, Chiefs (+300)Thornton already has more touchdowns in five games with the Chiefs (three) than he had in three seasons with the Patriots (two), scoring a touchdown in three of Kansas City's last four games. Although he broke his touchdown streak last week, Thornton had a season-high 90 receiving yards on three receptions with five targets, maintaining a role in the offense even with Xavier Worthy's return from a shoulder injury. Thornton is the most likely Kansas City player to record a receiving touchdown based on the model's simulations, even ahead of Worthy and Travis Kelce. He comes at a significantly longer price, especially at FanDuel, making him a top value for the model's Week 6 Sunday Night Football anytime touchdown picks. FanDuel offers Thornton at +300, while multiple betting apps have him priced below +200 odds. Play this with the latest FanDuel promo code, and new users can receive $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.Want more Week 6 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL anytime touchdown scorer prop picks for Chiefs vs. Lions in Week 6 Sunday Night Football.

They will host a 49ers team that got a couple of days extra rest after defeating the Los Angeles Rams 26-23 in overtime on Thursday Night Football. The 49ers will not have Brock Purdy (toe) available on Sunday, leaving Mac Jones in line for his fourth appearance. The Buccaneers will be without wide receivers Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (leg), as well as running back Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) on Sunday. Kickoff from Raymond James Stadium is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

The defense is more middle-of-the-pack, but the 49ers have still found ways to grind out wins. Christian McCaffrey has been forced into a hybrid role since the receiving corps is so injured, and he still hasn't tallied a rushing touchdown this season. He will be challenged on Sunday by a Bucs defense that is only allowing 92.4 yards on the ground per game.  Tampa Bay's pass rush isn't quite as solid and has allowed four of five opposing quarterbacks this season to throw for over 200 yards and at least one touchdown. (Sam Darnold threw for 341 yards with four touchdowns in Week 5.) Mayfield and the Bucs offense has been picking up the slack, however, and have been averaging 353.8 total yards and 27.0 points per game. The Bucs are dealing with injuries, as running back Bucky Irving and wide receiver Mike Evans have both been ruled out, although Rachaad White and Emeka Egbuka have been successfully filling those roles.Click here to bet 49ers vs. Buccaneers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's 49ers vs. Buccaneers score prediction, picksBoth teams are 3-2-0 ATS this season and have the ability to keep games close despite dealing with injuries to key players.

However, a deeper dive into the statistics paints a pretty clear picture that Tennessee is the inferior team. The Titans have been outgained by nearly 700 yards this season but have benefitted from being +1 in turnover differential while the Raiders have only been outgained by 27 yards but are -6 in turnover differential. Those types of numbers have a tendency to balance themselves out over time and the model predicts that Las Vegas covers in 56% of simulations.Over 44.5 points in Packers vs. Bengals (-110)Cincinnati's offense has been stuck in neutral without Joe Burrow (toe), but the Bengals are hopeful that 40-year-old Joe Flacco can give them a boost considering the talent he'll be surrounded by (Ja'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Chase Brown). Flacco struggled with the Browns this season but has had a recent history of sparking offenses midseason with the Colts, Browns and Jets over the last three years. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati defense ranks 30th in points allowed and yards allowed and could have a tough time with a Packers offense that hung 40 on the Cowboys before the bye. The model predicts the Over hits in 64% of simulations.Buccaneers -3.5 vs. 49ers (-105)\"Some curiosities about these teams should be answered on Sunday. Regarding the 49ers, how long are they going to be able to hang in there with a patchwork lineup? Injuries have decimated the roster but here the Niners sit at 4-1 into this weekend, with Mac Jones (in again for ailing Brock Purdy at QB) now 3-0 as a starter, even minus the likes of Brandon Aiyuk and George Kittle,\" Legendary SportsLine handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, the Bucs have mastered Perils of Pauline acts, with four last-minute wins in five games as orchestrated by QB Baker Mayfield, generating some deserving MLB buzz.

    "body": "\n        The Green Bay Packers (2-2-1) will host the Cincinnati Bengals (2-3) in an intriguing NFL Week 6 matchup on Paramount+. Cincinnati, which has lost three straight games, made headlines this week when it acquired quarterback Joe Flacco from the Cleveland Browns and named him Sunday's starter over Jake Browning. Meanwhile, Jordan Love and the Packers emerge from their Week 5 bye, which was preceded by a 40-40 overtime tie with the Dallas Cowboys. The Packers will be without wide receiver Christian Watson (knee) and offensive lineman Jacob Monk (hamstring) on Sunday. Kickoff from Lambeau Field is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

The Bengals defense isn't faultless, however, since it is allowing the third-most total yards per game (391.2) and points per game (31.2) in the NFL. Cincinnati's offense has gotten an upgrade -- at least on paper -- with Flacco under center, but the same porous defense will be going up against a Packers team that can march the ball downfield.  Love had his best game of the season in Week 4, completing 31 of 43 passes for 337 yards with three touchdowns against Dallas. He's averaging 250.0 yards per game while Josh Jacobs controls the rush with 66.5 yards per game and four rushing touchdowns on the season. The defense has been suspect however, giving up more than 10 fourth-quarter points to both the Cowboys and the Browns.Click here to bet Bengals vs. Packers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Bengals vs. Packers score prediction, picksThe Bengals are 1-4-0 ATS this season and it isn't clear whether the offense will get a boost from a change under center.

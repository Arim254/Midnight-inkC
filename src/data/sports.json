    "body": "\n        Super Bowl LX will take place next weekend between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots in the final game of the NFL season. However, the Super Bowl for NBA Draft enthusiasts, fans of tanking teams and NBA decision makers who hope the lottery balls fall their way in May will take place on Saturday in Lawrence, Kansas, when AJ Dybantsa and BYU play Darryn Peterson and Kansas.In a normal year, getting a matchup of projected top-three picks is a delight. This season? It's a whole new level. The race for the No. 1 pick is wide open heading into February. Ask 10 different people who they think the order should be between Dybantsa, Peterson and the current National Player of the Year favorite Cameron Boozer at Duke, and you will get multiple different answers.College basketball fans were supposed to get this heavyweight matchup earlier this season when Duke faced Kansas in the Champions Classic during the opening month of the season. However, Peterson didn't play due to a hamstring injury that kept him out of the lineup for nearly a month. Even last weekend, Peterson missed Kansas' showdown against Kansas State after suffering an ankle injury against Colorado.This is a matchup college basketball fans haven't seen in quite some time. Truthfully, it might be a while before we see something like this happen again. In corner (bench) No. 1, you have Peterson, who is considered one of the greatest guard prospects of this generation. In corner (bench) No. 2, you have Dybantsa, who was ranked as the No. 1 prospect in his class for quite some time before Peterson jumped him in the 247Sports rankings.\nBy all accounts, landing one of Peterson or Dybantsa in the draft would give a franchise a foundational building block for the future. This freshman class has already put up historic numbers, and this matchup is a culmination of the hype and stellar play we have seen thus far.Tale of the tapeStatAJ Dybantsa (BYU)Darryn Peterson (Kansas)Games played2010Points per game23.621.6Rebounds per game6.74.6Assists per game3.61.9FG%53%49.3%3P%31.8%42%FT%76.2%82%Blocks per game0.50.7Steals per game1.31Scouting Peterson and Dybantsa with an eye to the NBA(by CBS Sports Director of Basketball Scouting Adam Finkelstein)There is a very real debate about who the No. 1 pick is this year, and it's a debate that has been going back and forth for well over a year now. There are a lot of different iterations of it. At 247Sports, we had Peterson ranked as the No. 1 prospect coming out of high school. We moved him past Dybantsa in April, ahead of the release of the final class of 2025 rankings.But, Dybantsa has raised the level of his game this season at BYU, and there are real, persistent questions about Peterson's durability (he has missed 10 of Kansas 20 games), so the debate for No. 1 rages on now deep into their college seasons.\nAlso, I think Duke's Cameron Boozer has been and remains part of the No. 1 debate as well. My stance coming out of high school, which is now being echoed by a lot of NBA scouts and decision-makers, is that Boozer's floor is the highest -- his worst-case scenario is still a very productive NBA player. Now, Boozer doesn't have the same ceiling that Peterson and especially Dybantsa have, but there is almost no scenario anyone can envision where Boozer does not impact winning at the next level.There is some risk with Peterson and Dybantsa, but I have had multiple NBA executives admit to me that they are terrified of missing out on Peterson and Dybantsa.Scouting Peterson: Lethal shot-maker, dominant primary initiator We had Peterson as the No. 1-ranked prospect coming out of high school last year, and to be honest, when he has been on the floor this year, he's been even better than expected, especially with his shot-making. He is making the type of difficult shots, with consistency that were not necessarily a regular part of his arsenal a year ago. And because of his injuries, I am not sure that we've seen Peterson with 100% of his explosiveness this season.  So, as good as he's been in spurts, I think there is a very good case to be made that he would be even better if he were healthy.\nPeterson is a primary initiator who plays with the ball in his hands and can be the primary domino in someone's offense. But he also has some off ball vesatility which we've seen at Kansas this year. He can slide off the ball, and due to the progression of his shotmaking, come off pin-downs and different kinds of screening action away from the ball to score effectively.Scouting Dybantsa: Physical phenom, elite midrange scorerDybantsa is the most physically gifted prospect in the class in terms of position size, length, athleticism and even elasticity, with how someone his size can bend.  The best part of his game is his ability to get to his spot, rise and fire over the defense in the midrange game. Dybantsa also got a real knack for drawing fouls. He did it in more of a theatrical way in high school, where he was always flopping, but this year he has gotten better at legitimately playing through contact. The three-point shooting remains an important swing skill.The most notable thing for Dybantsa is that a year ago, when he was a senior in high school, he really seemed to plateau. There were no real notable gains in his game. And then from a competitive standpoint, he wasn't as locked in with his approach to the game -- it was more of a show, where he was always playing to the cameras and not putting winning at the forefront. That has all changed this year at BYU. Kevin Young has done a phenomenal job of not only getting Dybantsa to maximize his production and be about the right things, but also has surrounded him with extreme spacing and given him the total freedom to put up the type of numbers we are now seeing.\nIn terms of Dybantsa's NBA position, I think he's more of a three. That is part of the question NBA scouts and decision makers have: when things aren't all built around him like they are this year at BYU, what does it look like if he is the second or third option? Because by NBA standards, some of the decision making still has to go to another level before one of the 30 franchises give him the ball and trusts him to be the primary domino in their attack.History between Peterson and DybantsaPeterson finished as the No. 1 player in the 2025 recruiting cycle by 247Sports, while Dybantsa was second. Dybantsa was originally supposed to be a member of the 2026 recruiting class but elected to reclassify to 2025 to be eligible for this summer's NBA Draft. At one point, the 2025 recruiting class had Peterson, Dybantsa, Boozer and Cooper Flagg, who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.Flagg reclassified to be eligible for the 2025 NBA Draft. Had Flagg stayed in this class, it could've made what should be an all-time class even better.\nPeterson and Dybantsa have history dating back to the high school ranks. Peterson, who was a member of national prep powerhouse Prolific Prep, finished with 61 points, seven rebounds and five assists during an 88-86 win over Utah Prep, which is the school Dybantsa played at during his final season. Before that, Dybantsa played at Prolific Prep, but the two didn't overlap.\nIn that game, Dybantsa finished with 49 points, nine rebounds and three assists. The two also faced off in the McDonald's All-American Game last spring. Peterson scored 18 points and was named co-MVP of the event with Boozer. Dybantsa scored 13 in that game.In the CBS Sports NBA Prospect Rankings, Peterson is No. 1 and Dybantsa is No. 2. If Peterson and Dybantsa go off the board this summer with the first two picks, it would mark the latest matchup of that since 2010.\nBelow is the history of when top-three picks faced each other in the college ranks.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Duke vs. Baylor: 2025 NCAA TournamentMatchup: Cooper Flagg (No. 1) vs. VJ Edgecombe (No. 3)As my colleague Adam Finkelstein wrote last spring, Flagg and Edgecombe going head-to-head in the NCAA Tournament was the most star-powered NBA Draft matchup in years. Of course, Flagg was selected No. 1 overall by the Dallas Mavericks, while Edgecombe was taken two picks later at No. 3 by the Philadelphia 76ers. While Flagg and Edgecombe were the headliners, this game also featured two more top 10 picks on the Duke side in Kon Knueppel (No. 4 overall) and Khaman Maluach (No. 10).The Blue Devils cruised to an 89-66 win over Baylor to advance to the Sweet 16. Edgecombe finished with 16 points and six rebounds in his final collegiate game. Meanwhile, Flagg recorded 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists in 29 minutes of play. With how good this draft class projects to be, we could see another matchup like this during the spring.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Gonzaga vs. Duke: 2021-22 regular seasonMatchup:  Paolo Banchero (No. 1) vs. Chet Holmgren (No. 2)The last matchup in college between the No. 1 and 2 overall picks from the same draft came in 2021, when Duke faced Gonzaga. Not only was it an elite prospect matchup between Duke's Paolo Banchero and Gonzaga's Chet Holmgren, but it was also a game between two of the best teams in the sport. Gonzaga and Duke entered this game 6-0.Duke was able to come away with an 84-81 win over the Bulldogs behind 21 points from Banchero. Holmgren scored 16 points and added seven rebounds in the loss to the Blue Devils. Duke lost in the Final Four that season to North Carolina in coach Mike Krzyzewski's final season at the helm of the program.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCLA vs. Washington: 2016-17 regular seasonMatchup: Markelle Fultz (No. 1) vs. Lonzo Ball (No. 2)The last time the top two picks from the same draft faced off in conference play, you have to go back to 2017. At the time, Lonzo Ball was one of the most recognizable faces in basketball -- at any level -- after rising to fame during his time at Chino Hills High School in Southern California.\nUCLA and Washington faced off twice during the 2016-17 campaign. In the first contest, Ball dropped 22 points while Fultz scored 25 in a 107-66 win for UCLA. In the second matchup, which took place in Southern California, Ball finished with 19 points, eight assists and seven rebounds during UCLA's 98-66 win. Notably, Fultz didn't play in the second game.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas vs. Duke: 2013-14 regular seasonMatchup: Andrew Wiggins (No. 1) and Joel Embiid (No. 3) vs. Jabari Parker (No. 2)This game featured the first three picks in the 2014 NBA Draft. Kansas had Andrew Wiggins, who at the time was one of the most hyped up NBA prospects this decade, and Embiid, who went on to win NBA MVP. On the other side, Duke was led by Jabari Parker, who ended up going No. 2 overall to the Milwaukee Bucks.\nIn this game, Parker scored a game-high 27 points and added nine rebounds. Wiggins finished with 22 points and eight rebounds in 25 minutes, while Embiid came off the bench and logged just 20 minutes. Kansas was able to come away with a 94-83 win over Duke in the Champions Classic.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kentucky vs. Florida: 2011-12 regular seasonMatchup: Anthony Davis (No. 1) and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (No. 2) vs. Bradley Beal (No. 3)Anthony Davis' 2011-12 season is considered by most to be the best one-and-done year in college basketball history. Davis helped Kentucky win its last national title and won National Player of the Year honors after a standout season en route to becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft.Florida and Kentucky played each other three times that season -- twice during the regular season and once in the SEC Tournament. In the first matchup between the teams, No. 1 Kentucky defeated No. 8 Florida 78-58 behind 16 points from Davis and a double-double (13 points, 13 rebounds) from Kidd-Gilchrist. Beal dropped 14 points in the first matchup. In the second game, it was Davis who recorded a double-double (22 points, 12 rebounds), while Beal finished with just five points on 1-of-10 shooting.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Duke vs. Arizona: 2011 NCAA TournamentTale of the tape: Kyrie Irving (No. 1) vs. Derrick Williams (No. 2)If you don't remember Irving's career at Duke, well, here is a refresher: The No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft appeared in just 11 games for (at the time) the reigning national champions. Irving did return for the NCAA Tournament and dropped 28 points in his final collegiate game.However, Irving was outplayed by Williams, who finished with 32 points, 13 rebounds and two steals during the upset win over the Blue Devils. Williams raised his draft stock during that tournament run and was selected No. 2 overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Former North Carolina football coach Mack Brown is not surprised by New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye's early success in his NFL career, punctuated by his upcoming appearance in Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.Brown convinced the Charlotte, North Carolina, native to back away from his commitment to Alabama in 2020 and instead sign with the Tar Heels, where Maye became a two-year starter, leaving his mark with 62 touchdown passes over 26 career starts with Brown as his coach.The Patriots selected Maye at No. 3 overall in the 2024 cycle and now, he's a win away from bringing New England its first title since the Bill Belichick and Tom Brady era. Brown isn't surprised by his success.\"I told scouts when they would come through that he's a Super Bowl guy, He'll win a Super Bowl,\" Brown told WRAL this week. \"I didn't know he was going to have a chance to be the second youngest guy to ever do it.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Where does Drake Maye's sophomore season rank among the greatest second-year QB seasons in NFL history?\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown has coached several all-timers at the college level, particularly Vince Young and Colt McCoy at Texas. He believes Maye is on a path to surpass many of the sport's greats.\"I think Drake has the upside right now that, I hope he wins this one, if he doesn't, then there's another Super Bowl out there for Drake,\" Brown said. \"I think Drake will go down not only being one of the best that I've ever coached, but one of the best to ever play.\"Brown won a national championship at Texas thanks to Young's heroics on offense, but couldn't maximize his time with the Tar Heels during Maye's tenure. North Carolina went 17-10 overall during Maye's starts, including an appearance in the ACC title game in 2022.\nOne of five MVP finalists this season, Maye led the NFL in completion percentage (72%) and yards per attempt (8.9) while also finishing near the top of the league in passing yards per game (258.5) and touchdown passes (31).To be at his best against the Seahawks, Maye — who did not practice Friday due to illness — will try and offer his norm while battling through a shoulder injury. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel is not worried about Maye being limited -- for now.\"I try not to have a whole lot of concern,\" Vrabel said. \"I just want to try to prepare the football team, make sure that everybody's ready, that we all have a plan, not to surprise anybody and make sure that our guys are focusing on the first and second down plan.\"\n            ",

Topuria just so happened to knock out Volkanovski for the title originally. \"I think there is a lot that I can capitalize on [because] I'm capable of changing things and [utilizing] a new strategy,\" Volkanovski told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"Whether I want to take him down or fight at short range, I feel like I can make whatever adjustments are needed. But for him -- and this is not a knock on him -- but, what is he capable of? I hear people say that he is going to improve so much but I don't think I saw that in his last fight, to be honest. \n\"How much is he capable of changing? And, if he tries to, is that going to hold him back from what he does best? If he tries to out-strategize me, I think that just makes it a lot harder for him.

Salkilld scored a pair of incredible knockouts in 2025 that left fans speechless, including a head kick of Nasrat Haqparast that earn CBS Sports' KO of the Year.\nBet UFC 325 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:With so much happening on Saturday night, let's look closer at the full fight card with the latest odds before we get to our staff predictions and picks for the PPV portion of the festivities that you can consider before hitting the sportsbooks.\n        \n            \n                UFC 325: What can change for Alexander Volkanovski and Diego Lopes in a rematch just nine months later\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUFC 325 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook (as of Jan. 29)Alexander Volkanovski (c) -148 vs. Diego Lopes +124, featherweight titleBenoit Saint Denis -310 vs. Dan Hooker +250, lightweightsRafael Fiziev -120 vs. Mauricio Ruffy +100, lightweightsTallison Teixeira -345 vs. Tai Tuivasa +275, heavyweightsQuillan Salkilld -1050 vs. Jamie Mullarkey +675, lightweightsBilly Elekana -250  vs. Junior Tafa +205, light heavyweightsCam Rowston -360 vs. Cody Brundage +285, middleweightsJacob Malkoun -162 vs. Torrez Finney, +136 middleweightsJonathan Micallef -135 vs. Oban Elliott +114, welterweightsYizha -205 vs. Kaan Olfi +170, featherweightsDom Mar Fan -148 vs. Sangwook Kim +124, lightweightsSebastian Szalay -135 vs. Keiichiro Nakamura +114, featherweightsSulangrangbo -250 vs. Lawrence Liu +205, bantamweightsUFC 325 predictions, picksWith such a massive main event on tap, the crew at CBS Sports went ahead with predictions and picks for the main card from Brian Campbell, Brent Brookhouse, Shakiel Mahjouri, Michael Mormile and Brandon Wise.\n   CampbellBrookhouseMahjouriMormileWiseVolkanovski vs. LopesLopesVolkanovskiVolkanovskiVolkanovskiVolkanovskiHooker vs. Saint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisSaint DenisFiziev vs. RuffyRuffyFizievFizievFizievFizievTeixeira vs. TuivasaTuivasaTeixeiraTuivasaTeixeiraTeixeiraSalkilld vs. MullarkeySalkilldSalkilldSalkilldSalkilldSalkilldRecords to date 2-34-14-13-22-3Alexander Volkanovski vs. Diego Lopes predictionsCampbell: Volkanovski appeared to turn back the clock last April when he captured the vacant title by outpointing Lopes. But an honest Lopes, who still managed to drop Volkanovski, admitted after the fight that he failed to follow his corner's gameplan and got caught simply following his opponent around in hopes of a knockout. Expect a more seasoned and more dangerous Lopes in the rematch. Not only did he rely on grappling and the traps he set with striking to ultimately finish Jean Silva last September, he has been working relentlessly on rounding out his game. If Lopes does a better job cutting off the cage and using both his size and the threat of the takedown to make the 37-year-old Volkanovski feel his age, this should be a very different fight. And while Volkanovski's chin did hold up during their first fight despite having been fresh off of back-to-back knockout losses, his time at the top may be running out. Lopes via TKO3Brookhouse: It's hard to believe that this fight plays out much differently than the first fight unless Volkanovski has aged considerably in the past year. Yes, 37 is old for a fighter, especially a featherweight, but Volkanovski is a uniquely skilled tactician in his ability to not only prepare, but execute a gameplan. I don't see any reason to think that losses to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria signal a fighter is \"done\" at an elite level, simply that he ran into two of the best fighters on the planet in their prime. Lopes doesn't have a reliable takedown game, which means that this is a striking battle, and Volkanovski is great at working angles and finding timing. Yes, Lopes did hurt Volkanovski in the first fight, but that came in between Volkanovski clearly controlling the rest of the action. I simply don't believe that Lopes can out-gameplan and outexecute Volkanovski. Volkanovski via UDMahjouri: If this fight were a year from now, I'd pick Lopes in a heartbeat. The challenger has every physical advantage over the champ: height, reach, durability, and power. Lopes' inexperience cost him the first fight. Volkanovski showcased why he's a featherweight GOAT. He controlled the lead outside foot positioning, feinted brilliantly, and significantly outstruck Lopes. The champ pitched a near-perfect game, yet still gave up one or two rounds to Lopes' power. That's the worry here. Lopes' physical gifts will become a bigger factor as he narrows the technical gaps. The question is whether Lopes can cover enough distance in nine months to beat Volkanovski. It will be a much closer second fight, but Volkanovski should have enough in the tank to win a narrow decision. Volkanovski via UD\nMormile: Volkanovski UDWise: Volkanovski via UDDan Hooker vs. Benoit Saint Denis predictionsCampbell: Reformed following a pair of TKO defeats, Saint Denis has looked like a completely different fighter in three walks to the Octagon under the tutelage of new coach Nicholas Ott, which produced a trio of stoppage wins in 2025. The task at hand against Hooker on Saturday will be for 'BSD' to ignore the urge to throw caution to the wind off the start and get into a full-blown slugfest. Saint Denis is at his best when he balances patience and grappling with the threat of his powerful striking. And considering Hooker was finished in less than two rounds by Arman Tsarukyan just two months ago, this could be the perfect catapult for the French \"God of War\" to score a systematic stoppage victory and enter the top five at 155 pounds. Hooker is always game for battle, but his one-dimensional style has caught up with him on the elite level. Saint Denis via KO2Brookhouse: As long as Saint Denis remains solid in his approach and doesn't willingly engage in a brawl, this is his fight to lose. Hooker is a fighter who leaves a lot of defensive openings in his wide-open attacking style. Saint Denis has the ability to hurt Hooker on the feet in those exchanges, but would be well served to look to grapple and put Hooker on the floor. If Saint Denis can work from on top, he can damage Hooker with strikes to eventually set up a submission. Saint Denis via SUB2Mahjouri: Hooker has no designs on changing his style. He's hell-bent on action, and it'll cost him against on Saturday. Neither man has perfect durability, but Hooker has more wear and tear. That's concerning against Saint Denis, the younger and arguably more powerful fighter. Saint Denis looks revitalized working with top middleweight contender Nassourine Imavov. The French special forces soldier has the natural gifts and evolving skillset to make short work of Hooker. It's imperative, however, that he doesn't abandon his defense. Hooker can still crack and will catch Saint Denis if he's not careful. Saint Denis via KO2\nMormile: Saint Denis via submissionWise: Saint Denis via TKO3Rafael Fiziev vs. Mauricio Ruffy predictionsCampbell: Urgency is the name of the game in this top 15 matchup at lightweight as both fighters can desperately use a big win to further propel themselves back into contention. Ruffy, who suffered a humbling submission defeat at the hands of Saint Denis last September in a fight that exposed his lack of a grappling game, moved from the Fighting Nerds camp in Brazil to train with Volkanovski in Australia. Fiziev, meanwhile, who snapped a three-fight losing skid last June when he took a decision from Ignacio Bahamondes, is finally healthy and looking to put a pair of decision defeats to new interim champion Justin Gaethje behind him. That means this fight has all the potential to be a fun striking match over three rounds and one that is very evenly contested. If Ruffy can add the threat of wrestling, it could be the difference. Ruffy via UDBrookhouse: If anyone can add wrestling threats to this fight, it's Fiziev. Ruffy has never scored a takedown in the UFC and he was taken down three times while being dominated by Saint Denis. Fiziev, meanwhile, has scored six takedowns in his two most recent fights, including two against Justin Gaethje. In a fairly even battle of strikers, though Ruffy may be a bit more dynamic in his angles and shot selection, one fighter having the edge in grappling is enough to tilt the fight on paper. While either man could catch the other on the feet, Fiziev's new confidence in his wrestling gives me some comfort in siding with him. Fiziev via UDMahjouri: This might be an even more compelling action fight than the co-main event. Fiziev and Ruffy are on the cusp of entering the lightweight elite. Fiziev is a first-class Muay Thai striker with an improving wrestling game. Ruffy, a textbook KO artist, recently migrated from the Fighting Nerds to featherweight champ Volkanovski's camp. I was prepared to count Fiziev out, but I think he's a victim of bad luck. His three UFC losses are a majority decision to Justin Gaethje, a freak knee injury against Mateusz Gamrot and a close rematch against Gaethje, which he took on two weeks' notice after a year-and-a-half layoff from the aforementioned injury. Fiziev showed signs of life in a bounce-back win against Ignacio Bahamondes, complementing his striking with newfound wrestling. Ruffy might revolutionize himself with Team Volkanovski, but I'll need to see the results before assessing his future.

The WWE Royal Rumble is the starting line for a journey that culminates with two world title matches at the Showcase of the Immortals. The man and woman who win their respective Rumble matches will choose a world champion to face at WrestleMania. Surviving the gauntlet can instantly create a new star or give a main event talent another shot at glory.This year's fields are immensely competitive with numerous former champions in the mix. Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar are among the heavy favorites in the men's match. Rhea Ripley, Becky Lynch and Liv Morgan are all big names on the women's side. For every former world champion on the card, multiple hungry contenders are looking to break out. Keep a close eye on Bron Breakker, Jacob Fatu, Jordynne Grace and Giulia to upset the applecart. Plus, a world title match is set for Saturday when WWE champion Drew McIntyre defends his title for the first time against Sami Zayn. Zayn, who has never won a singles world title, won a fatal four way to earn his opportunity against McIntyre. However, Zayn has a sorted history with the Scotsman as he is 0-12 all time in singles competition against him. If Zayn is to win his first world title, he'll have to make some history to do so.\nAlso on the card is a retirement match between Gunther and AJ Styles. Gunther has become the boogeyman of WWE after retiring both Goldberg and John Cena last year. Now he faces Styles, who has already said 2026 will be his last year of in-ring competition.Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday afternoon.

    "body": "\n        If the Golden State Warriors somehow swing a trade-deadline blockbuster for Giannis Antetokounmpo, the two-timeline plan will turn back into one and it will have all been worth it. For years, the Warriors, like plenty of other potential suitors, have regarded Giannis as the \"white whale\" catch for which they were hoarding a boatload of assets. Well, that's not entirely true. The Warriors have also been hoarding assets because Joe Lacob believes he has been the author of this dynasty all along, and when the day comes, he's obsessed with proving he can write an equally successful sequel. But if ever there was a player that would convince him to back off this save-for-the-future stance and go all YOLO, it's Giannis. And now that he's actually available, the Warriors, according to ESPN's Anthony Slater, are willing to go all in to get a blockbuster done ahead of next Thursday's 3 p.m. ET trade deadline. \n        \n            \n                Ranking Giannis Antetokounmpo trade packages: Who can make best deadline offer?\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat means, potentially, unprotected first-round picks in 2026, 2028 and 2032, a top-20 protected pick in 2030 and a 2031 swap. On top of that, Jonathan Kuminga, who Slater reports the Bucks have expressed interest in since the summer, and Brandin Podziemski, who, again according to Slater, could \"nudge the needle\" in the direction of a deal. \nIt's a major package. Probably better than any other realistic deadline suitor can offer. Those future picks, particularly in 2030, 2031 and 2032, could become very valuable in a post-Curry world. He'll be well past 40 by then. Maybe retired. Giannis, even if he stays with the Warriors longer, would be out of his prime, too. Sure, the Warriors would have money with Curry and Draymond Green potentially off the books and could, theoretically, build another winner via free agency in Giannis's later years. But all future picks are a bet, and all things considered, this would be a pretty good one for the Bucks to take. The Warriors have to evaluate their risk in a deal like this, too. Give up all your picks and fire the Kuminga bullet and then an aging Curry or Giannis or Green gets hurt, just like Jimmy Butler did? It's over. Not just now, but for the future, too. It's a big bet. But it's worth it, as Curry and Antetokounmpo would be a once-in-a-lifetime pairing. \nOn their own, Giannis is the fiercest rim attacker in the world, as Curry is the greatest 3-point shooter to ever live. Those two gravitational forces together -- Giannis sucking defenses in, Curry pulling them out -- present what might be an unsolvable defensive dilemma. The same was thought of the Giannis-Damian Lillard pairing, but the difference between Lillard and Curry is that Curry operates off the ball. That wasn't natural for Lillard. He's not the mover Curry is. Nobody in the history of the game has been. It was, in hindsight, a backwards pairing. Maximizing Lillard meant taking Giannis off the ball, where his shooting deficiencies become a greater handicap. Giving the ball to Giannis marginalized Lillard. There would be no such tradeoff with Curry and Giannis. Curry is a rim attacker's dream, dragging paranoid defenders everywhere he moves in bunches. Good luck building that Giannis wall in the paint without Curry killing you from deep. And vice versa. It's the same model that made Curry and Butler so good together, the driver and the shooter sitting shotgun. Giannis is just several levels up from Butler. \nTo be fair, there would be issues. Giannis and Green together are a spacing cramp. You don't have to guard either of them on the perimeter. The Warriors do not want to devolve into a give-it-to-Giannis-and-let-him-bulldoze-his-way-to-the-rim offense, but how comfortable, and ultimately effective, would Giannis be in a movement-based system that requires the highest of anticipatory and improvisational instincts? Giannis' feel for the game has grown greatly. He can make the 4-on-3 reads if he's in two-man actions with a double-teamed Curry. But he's certainly not the most natural of short rollers. And where would that leave Green? If he's not the one orchestrating offense, he holds zero value as a floor spacer and would be left to impact possessions in the cracks with screens and cuts. He's smart. He can do it. It's not optimal for him. In the end, however, the power of the Curry-Giannis pairing would be so overwhelming that nothing else might matter. Let Draymond run the defense, which has been a top five unit for stretches of the season. Quentin Post and Al Horford can space the floor as centers. Kuminga wasn't playing anyway. The depth would still largely be there. \nRemember, the Warriors were very possibly headed for the conference finals last season before Curry got hurt. They went 22-5 with Curry and Butler in the lineup together down the stretch. This sort of inside-out dynamic has already been proven, and, again, Butler, for all the connectivity he brings to the table, isn't anywhere near the sheer physical force that Giannis is. Who knows if this will happen? The Bucks can probably spark a bigger bidding war in the summer, when more teams have more ammo to fire. But it's clear that Giannis wants to get this done now, and if you think that doesn't matter, then you haven't been paying attention to how the NBA works. Golden State has a serious offer. The Bucks are likely mulling it, and others, over as we speak. If it actually happens and Curry and Giannis end up in the same uniform, a Warriors season that looked like it ended with Butler's injury will start anew with the beginning of a marriage made in basketball heaven. \n            ",

The main card begins at 9 p.m. ET and will stream on Paramount+, with Qudos Bank Arena playing host. Many UFC 325 bets will center on the main event of Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2, which is a featherweight championship rematch. Reigning two-time champion Alexander Volkanovski (27-4) will look for another victory over challenger, Diego Lopes (27-7), after the former prevailed via decision at UFC 314 last April.The latest UFC 325 odds have Volkanovski as the -148 favorite (risk $148 to win $100) as the Aussie will have the backing of the home crowd. Lopes, the No. 2 ranked featherweight, comes in at +124 (risk $100 to win $124). The co-main event is a lightweight battle between No. 6 Dan Hooker (+275) and No. 8 Benoit Saint-Denis (-345).

He was honored by topping the promotion's pound-for-pound rankings in both 2022 and 2023, and at one point he had an 11-fight win streak within the featherweight division. While he has just a 2-3 record over his last five bouts, two of those came when Volkanovski stepped up in weight class and challenged Islam Makhachev for the UFC Lightweight Championship, losing both bouts to Makhachev.The other defeat saw the Aussie drop the featherweight title to Ilia Topuria in Feb. 2024. However, he then won the vacant UFC Featherweight Championship in his next bout, which was the first match with Lopes. Volkanovski won via unanimous decision as he landed more than twice as many significant strikes (158) than his opponent landed total strikes (71). That was the 11th decision victory of Volkanovski's MMA career, as he also has 13 KOs and three submission triumphs. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 31-year-old Lopes has youth on his side versus Volkanovski, in addition to five inches over his 5-foot-6 opponent. A native of Brazil, Lopes has a BJJ background and signed with UFC in 2023. After dropping his first fight, he then went on a five-bout winning streak, earning Performance of the Night twice during that span. That led to his first title shot versus Volkanovski at UFC 314 in April 2025, and though the Brazilian came up short, the bout was awarded Fight of the Night.\nWhile Volkanovski has been idle since then, Lopes took a fight against Jean Silva, a fellow Brazilian who was ranked and had recorded five straight finish victories. Lopes prevailed in that September 2025 bout via TKO with a spinning elbow and punches. That was his 11th knockout victory, to go along with 12 submissions and four wins via decision. Neither Lopes nor Volkanovski have ever lost via submission, though both have tasted defeat by knockout and on the scorecards. You can only see the model's UFC 325 picks and analysis at SportsLine. UFC 325: Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2   predictionsOne of the model's top UFC 325 picks: It is backing Mauricio Ruffy at -110 (+6.0% edge) against Rafael Fiziev. \"From a stylistic perspective, this is a clash between Ruffy, who profiles as a technical fighter, and Fiziev, who operates primarily as a power striker,\" McClure said. \"There's a reasonable chance we see a finish here -- our model projects a 57% stoppage rate with knockout or TKO being the most common method at 47%. This is a modest edge on the favorite, but playable at this price.

Bet it at bet365 here:Rockets (-10.5) vs. Mavericks (-110)\nThe Rockets (29-17) have a 10-win edge over the Mavericks (19-29), and Houston hosts this Lone Star State matchup on Saturday night. Kevin Durant, one of the NBA's all-time greatest scorers, is in the midst of another impressive scoring run, even at 37 years old. He scored 31 points in a 104-86 win over the Hawks on Thursday, surpassing 30 points for the fourth time over his last five contests. Dallas has lost three straight games, all coming at home, and the Mavericks are 5-14 on the road this season.  The Rockets are 16-4 at home this season, and the model expects that homecourt dominance to continue with a convincing win on Saturday, projecting the Rockets to cover in 62% of simulations. Back the Rockets at bet365 here:Saint Mary's (+10.5) vs. Gonzaga (-110)\"No Braden Huff for Gonzaga and Graham Ike is currently questionable. Ike has been sidelined for 15 day and even if he does play, he may not be 100%,\" SportsLine expert Bob Konarski noted. \"This is a matchup that the Gaels and Randy Bennett know well. Saint Mary's has won and covered three of the last four meetings while also winning outright five of the last seven. There's something about Bennett's ability to game plan for the Bulldogs and make them play his style. Without Huff, and maybe Ike, the Gaels have a better chance to battle on the boards.\" Back Saint Mary's at bet365 here:Diego Lopes to defeat Alexander Volkanovski Inside the Distance (+175)\"This is a rematch from last year, and Volkanovski almost landed 100 more significant strikes in his decision win,\" SportsLine expert Kyle Marley said. \"He is the better minute-winner on the feet or the ground, and he can dictate where the fight takes place. Lopes is the more dangerous fighter on the feet and the ground, and he did knock Volk down in their last fight. He also held Volk to 1 of 11 on takedowns. He is coming off a big finish over Jean Silva, and Volk hasn't fought since their last matchup. I think the momentum is on Lopes' side, and it feels like the UFC wants him to win, since they booked this rematch so quickly. If it goes the distance, then Volk likely wins. However, give me Lopes to get an exciting finish.\" Back Lopes at bet365 here:\nLooking for NBA, college basketball and UFC 325 picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Saturday.

The Gaels are 4-2 in their last six games against Gonzaga and have covered this number five times over that span. Sometimes past results don't matter, but I look at trends more when the coaches don't change. Randy Bennett and Mark Few know each other well, so recent results hold more weight. Saint. Mary's is the top free-throw shooting team in the WCC at 81.4 percent, while Gonzaga ranks last at 64.6 percent. That big edge for the Gaels could come into play if the game is competitive late.\" Bet St. Mary's to cover at DraftKings here:Rockets (-10.5) vs. Mavericks (-110)Houston enters off a 104-86 victory against the Hawks in Atlanta, improving to 29-17 overall this season.

The Rockets host on Saturday, and they are 16-4 in Houston this season. The Mavericks remain without their veteran superstars in Anthony Davis (finger) and Kyrie Irving (knee), and Kevin Durant is coming off scoring 31 points for the Rockets against Atlanta. The 37-year-old future Hall of Famer is 11th in the league in scoring at 26.5 points per game, including scoring more than 30 points in four of his last five games.

While I don't think he can beat Volkanovski in a pure kickboxing fight, I do believe that he can hurt the champion again, especially if he mixes in his lethal grappling attack. The odds seem curiously short on Volkanovski, considering he won four of five rounds in their first fight. Lopes' incredible durability and explosiveness make him a live underdog for every moment of this fight.\" Bet Lopes and UFC 325 at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA, college basketball and UFC 325 on Saturday?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

    "body": "\nThe matchup for Super Bowl LX is set, with the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, Feb. 8. For the first time in the history of The Big Game, each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup. New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX. New England quarterback Drake Maye didn't practice on Friday due to an illness. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Seahawks are 11-9 all-time versus New England. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots   odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 45.5, with the Over slightly favored at -112 and the Under a -108..

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Seahawks vs. Patriots, and which side of the Super Bowl spread is the better value?

    "body": "\n        UFC 325 is set to go down in Australia this Saturday, making for a second consecutive weekend with a numbered UFC event. In the night's main event, featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski will face Diego Lopes in a rematch.Volkanovski won the first meeting at UFC 314 by unanimous decision. That win kicked off Volkanovski's second reign as champion after he'd dropped the title to Ilia Topuria in February 2024. Lopes bounced back with a massive win over Jean Silva in September by spinning back elbow. The Brazilian believes things will be different this time around. \"When I look back at the first fight, I know that I had big moments but I am grateful because the first fight with Volk taught me a lot of different things [about] my life and my career,\" Lopes told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"I fixed those things and now I am a completely different fighter compared to the first fight. Now, I have the experience [of] fighting five rounds and now I have the experience of being in the main event with the cameras behind me. Nothing is new for me now so I don't have the pressure.\"Elsewhere on Saturday night, a pair of lightweight bouts could steal the show -- and position the winners for a move closer to title contention. In the featured bout, Rafael Fiziev and Mauricio Ruffy are set to throw down and both men have a penchant for knockouts. And speaking of knockouts, the co-main event could see just that when Dan Hooker takes on Benoit Saint Denis. Hooker has only seen the judges' scorecards two times in his last six fights. BSD, meanwhile, is coming off a 16-second finish of Beneil Dariush.\nAs with any UFC pay-per-view event, there's sure to be plenty of action at the sportsbook window, and with that in mind, we are taking a look at the best bet to make for every main card fight at UFC 325.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!After going 31-25 for our best bets in 2025, we kicked off 2026 by going 3-2 at UFC 324. Now we look ahead to this weekend, with our only rule remaining that all bets must be at odds of -250 or better. Let's take a look at this week's picks with odds via DraftKings Sportsbook. \n Bet UFC 325 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Quillan Salkilld\tvs.\tJamie MullarkeyQuillan Salkilld via KO/TKO/DQ (-145)Salkilld scored two massive knockouts in three 2025 victories, including the CBS Sports Knockout of the Year. Mullarkey is 4-4 since 2022, and he has been stopped by knockout or TKO in all four of his losses. Salkilld averages 1.3 more strikes landed per minute and absorbs nearly one less. All of that adds up to a fair chance that Salkilld scores yet another viral knockout to rile up his countrymen.Tai Tuivasa\tvs.\tTallison TeixeiraTallison Teixeira via KO/TKO/DQ (-225)Teixeira is coming off a disappointing TKO loss to Derrick Lewis on a somewhat questionable stoppage. That said, Tuivasa is on a five-fight losing skid and lacks the unique physical tools Teixeira has. Teixeira is a towering 6-foot-7, giving him a five-inch advantage in height over Tuivasa. Teixeira utilizes all four limbs well in his attack and that should allow him to bully Tuivasa both at distance and in the clinch. This seems like it will be Tuivasa's last ride in the UFC.\nRafael Fiziev\tvs.\tMaurício RuffyRafael Fiziev moneyline (+100)Fiziev vs. Ruffy is a very even fight on paper, which means you have to find the little edges where the fight can be decided. Both men have power in their strikes, though Ruffy may be a little more fluid in his attack. But in Ruffy's most recent fight, a second-round submission loss to Benoit Saint Denis, he was taken down repeatedly and showed no ability to get off his back. Fiziev has never been a guy who focuses on his grappling, except that he has six takedowns in his two most recent fights. His team has no doubt planned for exploiting that weakness in Ruffy's game and that gives Fiziev enough of an edge to take him in this pick'em fight.Dan Hooker\tvs.\tBenoit Saint DenisBenoit Saint Denis via KO/TKO/DQ or Submission (-130)Saint Denis suffered a pair of brutal back-to-back losses to Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano in 2024 but has rebounded with three impressive victories. Hooker represents the exact kind of opponent that Saint Denis can unload his entire game on. Hooker is very wide-open in his attack, absorbing as many significant strikes as he lands per minute and with good, but not great, takedown defense. Saint Denis averages nearly five takedowns per 15 minutes, while Hooker defends takedowns at 77%. Saint Denis should be able to take advantage of Hooker's defensive holes, both in striking and in grappling. Once Saint Denis gets rolling, he should be able to find a finish against Hooker, who has seven stoppage losses in his career.Alexander Volkanovski vs.\tDiego LopesAlexander Volkanovski moneyline (-148)I struggle to see any reason why this rematch looks much different from the first meeting. Volkanovski is one of the craftiest fighters of the era, rarely making mistakes. There's no shame in losing to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria, who may be the two best fighters on the planet. Is Lopes in that group? I don't believe so. Lopes is good enough to get the win, as he showed when he hurt Volkanovski late in their first meeting. But Volkanovski is the better all-around fighter, and he is the favorite for a reason. We'll roll with Volkanovski to repeat his victory and continue to build his resume as one of the greatest featherweights in history.\nWho wins Volkanovski vs. Lopes, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's time to kick off one of the best times of year for wrestling fans. The Road to WrestleMania gets underway on Saturday night in Saudi Arabia when WWE takes the Royal Rumble to Riyadh. One of the promotion's tentpole events, the Royal Rumble began running annually in 1988. It presents the 30 participants with the opportunity to be in a championship match at WrestleMania. Last year saw an incredible bit of theater in the men's match as it came down to Jey Uso and John Cena, who was participating in his final Royal Rumble amid his retirement tour. Uso managed to finish things off by tossing Cena over the top rope and he capped it off by besting Gunther for the world heavyweight title in April.Plus, a returning Charlotte Flair managed to be the last woman standing to punch her ticket to WrestleMania after more than a year away with a knee injury. While there are some superstars who have declared their entry into the over-the-top-rope elimination match, there's always a handful of surprises fans don't see coming between both the men's and women's matches.\nThis year's winners are anyone's guess with star-studded fields expected for both matches.\n        \n            \n                WWE burning questions for the Road to WrestleMania 42: Who wins the Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber and more\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPlus, a world title match is set for Saturday when WWE champion Drew McIntyre defends his title for the first time against Sami Zayn. Zayn, who has never won a singles world title, won a fatal four way to earn his opportunity against McIntyre. However, Zayn has a sorted history with the Scotsman as he is 0-12 all time in singles competition against him. If Zayn is to win his first world title, he'll have to make some history to do so.Also on the card is a retirement match between Gunther and AJ Styles. Gunther has become the boogeyman of WWE after retiring both Goldberg and John Cena last year. Now he faces Styles, who has already said 2026 will be his last year of in-ring competition. \nTake a look below at the confirmed matches for the Royal Rumble as well as our staff picks and predictions for each match. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited with the main card starting at 2 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Royal Rumble matchesMen's Royal  Rumble match -- Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, Gunther, Jey Uso, Rey Mysterio, Jacob Fatu, Solo Sikoa, Dragon Lee, Penta, Bron Breakker, Logan Paul, Bronson Reed, Austin Theory, Je'Von Evans, Oba Femi, Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar and 13 more: The match already has a who's who of entrants that we know. There's five surefire Hall of Famers, former world champions and plenty of upstart talent set to participate. Be on the look out for The Vision and the four members who are set to enter. They could pose a united front and take out much of the field.Undisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: McIntyre learned the identity of his first title challenger at Saturday Night's Main Event. Randy Orton, Trick Williams, Damian Priest and Zayn met in a No. 1 contender's match after winning their qualifying matches. Zayn stood tall in Montreal, catching Priest with a Helluva Kick to punch his ticket to the Rumble. Zayn has never won a world title in WWE, and has made it his mission to change his fortunes this year.\nWomen's Royal Rumble match -- Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, Roxanne Perez, Liv Morgan, Raquel Rodriguez, Bayley, Lyra Valkyria, Asuka, Chelsea Green, Jordynne Grace, Charlotte Flair, Alexa Bliss, Nia Jax, Lash Legend, Giulia, Maxxine Dupri, Becky Lynch and 13 more: The women's Rumble is stacked. Eight former women's world champions are among the 15 superstars currently announced for the match. Expect more stars to throw their names into the hat before the Rumble begins.AJ Styles vs. Gunther: Gunther is turning into a new age Legend Killer. Last year, \"The Ring General\" retired both John Cena and Goldberg. He wants to do the same to Styles. \"The Phenomenal\" one previously announced he'd retire in 2026, but Gunther hopes to expedite the process. Gunther stole a victory from Styles on Monday Night Raw, and only granted him a rematch under the condition that Styles retires if he loses at the Rumble.\n            ",

Now he faces Styles, who has already said 2026 will be his last year of in-ring competition. \nWith so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what   the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action   goes down in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Be sure to give a look at the viewing information for Saturday as well. 2026 WWE Royal Rumble predictionsMen's Royal Rumble match: While WWE pulled a brilliant move last year by having Jey Uso win the Rumble to the surprise of everyone, it feels as though there is a good chance that this year's edition gets the \"expected winner\" treatment. Breakker is very clearly positioned to challenge CM Punk for the world heavyweight championship at WrestleMania. While Oba Femi might be the man who has the standout Rumble performance, Breakker has the backing of The Vision, who has agreed to help Breakker get the win. It's not the most shocking outcome, but it makes plenty of sense to set up a big match for WrestleMania. Pick: Breakker wins -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)Women's Royal Rumble match: Where is Belair? She contributed to the best match of WrestleMania 41 weekend, a women's world title match with Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky. During the match, she suffered a finger injury that sidelined her for over eight months. In July, Belair told CBS Sports that she was at \"the tail end of this healing process,\" but we still haven't seen her wrestle. She re-entered the women's world title scene on the road to WrestleMania last year. I cross my fingers that she does the same this year as a surprise entrant. Pick: Belair wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse) \nUndisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: Sometimes, you have to just look at a match and think, \"Hey, why not?\" It's fairly clear that Zayn will eventually have a run with a world title, and this is an easy opportunity to put the title on him for a month or two before taking it off of him ahead of WrestleMania. It probably makes sense to keep the title on McIntyre, but if we aren't going to get surprising Rumble winners, why not a surprising title change? Pick: Zayn wins -- BrookhouseMcIntyre and Zayn both deserve solid world title reigns, but the defending champ deserves it slightly more. This version of McIntyre has repeatedly fallen short, or had his reign ended the same night it started. McIntyre must win his first title defense, especially amid his feuds with Rhodes and Fatu. I'm not sure McIntyre enters WrestleMania, let alone leaves it, with the undisputed WWE title, but he should hold it past the Rumble. Pick: McIntyre wins -- Mahjouri  AJ Styles vs. Gunther: Do I want Gunther to win? No. I want Styles, my all-time favorite professional wrestler, to deny a loss that would see him retire. I want him to steal Gunther's Rumble spot and win the 30-man match, 10 years after he debuted at the same event, before he retires in 2026. I want him to headline WrestleMania and further his phenomenal legacy. The story is right there. Sometimes the obvious decision is the right one, but I'm not confident WWE will see it through. Reports about creative shake-ups inspire some hope, but not enough to pick against the modern-day legend killer. Pick: Gunther wins -- Mahjouri  \nStyles isn't going to lose a retirement match. Sure, they could do a rerun of the referee missing Gunther tapping out only for Gunther to win and then reverse the decision on Raw, but that feels unnecessarily complicated. Rather than jumping through unnecessary hoops, Styles should just get the win and continue along his final year as an active wrestler. Pick: Styles wins -- Brookhouse  \n            ",

It's a busy month on Paramount+ with consecutive weeks of numbered events. UFC 325 takes place in Sydney on Sunday (Saturday in the United States), a week after the incredible scenes from UFC 324 in Las Vegas.Volkanovski, the UFC featherweight champion, has deja vu. While he had pictured a fight against Movsar Evloev or Lerone Murphy, Volkanovski instead fights Lopes for the second time in a row. Volkanovski shushed retirement rumors, but conceded that he's closer to the finish line than the start. Already one of the best featherweights in history, Volkanovski is determined to savor every moment of his second reign as champion.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\"I think there is a lot that I can capitalize on [because] I'm capable of changing things and [utilizing] a new strategy,\" Volkanovski told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"Whether I want to take him down or fight at short range, I feel like I can make whatever adjustments are needed. But for him -- and this is not a knock on him -- but, what is he capable of? I hear people say that he is going to improve so much but I don't think I saw that in his last fight, to be honest. \n\"How much is he capable of changing? And, if he tries to, is that going to hold him back from what he does best? If he tries to out-strategize me, I think that just makes it a lot harder for him. And if he does plan on doing that, that's going to completely change halfway through the first round.\" Lopes took a short detour between Volkanovski fights. Lopes, who graduated from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years, is coming off a knockout win over Jean Silva that was in the running for CBS Sports' 2025 Fight of the Year. Lopes is an impressive dual threat who captured fans' attention with his ability to knock people out or submit them with equal efficacy. \"When I look back at the first fight, I know that I had big moments but I am grateful because the first fight with Volk taught me a lot of different things [about] my life and my career,\" Lopes told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"I fixed those things and now I am a completely different fighter compared to the first fight. Now, I have the experience [of] fighting five rounds and now I have the experience of being in the main event with the cameras behind me. Nothing is new for me now so I don't have the pressure.\"\nBet UFC 325 at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Below is the complete fight card for UFC 325, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\n        Fifteen of the teams ranked in the latest AP Top 25 poll will be in action Saturday during a loaded college basketball slate. This weekend features a little bit of everything, including a prospect matchup for the ages, John Calipari facing his old team and Gonzaga and Saint Mary's squaring off for one of the final times as conference foes. The fun begins in Blacksburg, Virginia, when Virginia Tech hosts No. 4 Duke. The Blue Devils are at the top of the ACC standings heading into the weekend with a perfect 8-0 record, while Virginia Tech is 5-4 against conference opponents. No. 14 Kansas will host No. 13 BYU in a matchup of two of the best prospects in the 2026 NBA Draft. Kansas' Darryn Peterson and BYU's AJ Dybantsa are expected to go off the board with the first two picks in the draft this summer. This will be a prospect matchup that college basketball fans haven't seen in quite some time. \n        \n            \n                Darryn Peterson vs. AJ Dybantsa is prospect matchup for the ages -- and Super Bowl for tanking NBA teams\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne of the most anticipated games of the season will take place at Bud Walton Arena later in the day when No. 15 Arkansas hosts Kentucky. Calipari will be facing his old team for the second time since departing Kentucky during the 2024 offseason. Arkansas won the lone matchup between the SEC foes last season at Rupp Arena. \nThe matchup between Saint Mary's and Gonzaga has become appointment television over the last decade as one of the best rivalries on the West Coast.

This time around, the script feels like it might get flipped. Kentucky has been struggling, and the Wildcats are coming off an ugly loss against Vanderbilt. A win over Calipari's Razorbacks has a chance to flip the season around. Kentucky keeps this close and covers the spread.

Outside of that, the Zags have been dominant. Since suffering a loss to Michigan, Gonzaga has won its last 11 games. Eight of those wins have been by at least 10 points. Although this rivalry often creates chaos every time these teams play, I expect Gonzaga to win this game by at least 10.

Utah State won both of these matchups last year, but San Diego State shot just 28% from the field against Utah State's zone in the first matchup compared to 45% in the second duel, per Synergy. That's a notable difference that could rear its ugly head again. San Diego State is also down two starters, as freshman guard Elzie Harrington (leg) and shot-blocking big man Magoon Gwath (hip) have both been ruled out. The Aztecs have terrific depth, but they are unfailingly inconsistent from 3-point range. If Utah State's zone can coax SDSU to shoot a few more triples than normal and the Aggies hold up on the glass, Utah State will be in good shape. Pick: Utah State -6 -- Isaac Trotter \n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n             \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UTSU -6\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \t\t\t\t \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    SU\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \t\t\t\t \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Utah St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.                       \n            ",

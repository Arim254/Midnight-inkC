However, the Boilermakers have won four straight since and 21 of 22 games outside that stretch to enter Tuesday at 21-4 overall. Michigan is the well-deserved top-ranked team at 24-1 overall and on a 10-game winning streak, but Purdue has won three straight in their series on its home court. The Boilermakers are 15-7 all-time against Michigan at home.

Iowa is eighth in the conference with eight wins so far, but those wins have come against second-tier Big Ten teams. Nebraska has proved that it is worthy of being a first-class tiered Big Ten squad. Their defense allows only 39.8% shooting, and offensively, they are fourth nationally in assists-to-turnover ratio (1.95). Total team effort. Nebraska averages 79.4 points and is 6-1 on the road.

    "body": "\n        Asked if he would rule out teeing it up at the 2026 Masters, Tiger Woods responded with a simple, one-worded answer, \"No.\" Speaking ahead of the 2026 Genesis Invitational, where he serves as the tournament host, the 15-time major champion was unable to give a firm timeline on his return to competitive golf, though the 50-year-old did confirm that he is at least eyeing Augusta National in April as a possible landing spot.\"I'm trying [to come back], put it that way,\" Woods said. \"The disc replacement has been one thing. It's been a challenge to -- I've had a fused back and now a disc replacement, so it's challenging. \"And now, I entered a new decade, so that number is starting to sink in and has us thinking about the opportunity to be able to play in a cart. That's something that, as I said, I won't do out here on [the PGA Tour] because I don't believe in it. But on the Champions Tour, that's certainly that opportunity.\"Woods announced in October 2025 that he underwent another back surgery, this one to replace a collapsed lumbar disc. The procedure came as he was already recovering from a torn Achilles, which also required surgery and caused him to miss the entire 2025 season.\n\"The Achilles was not an issue. I can't dunk a basketball anymore, so I don't have to worry about that,\" Woods said with a smirk. \"As far as the disc replacement, it's just sore. It takes time. [Will Zalatoris] went through it, and it took him a while to come back. I'm a little bit older than Willy Z. It's probably going to take me a little bit longer. \"My body has been through a lot. It's just one of those things where it's each and every day, I keep trying, I keep progressing, I keep working on it, trying to get stronger, trying to get more endurance in this body and trying to get it at a level at which I can play at the highest level again.\"Despite being on screen cheering on his Jupiter Links team in TGL, Woods has not hit a shot in competition since the 2024 Open. That season, he played in only five events and was forced to withdraw from the Genesis Invitational before missing the cuts at the PGA Championship, U.S. Open and The Open. \nThe only time Woods saw weekend action was the Masters, where he set the tournament record with his 24th straight made cut and finished in solo 60th, last among those who played the weekend.\"I'm able to [hit full shots],\" Woods said. \"Not well every day, but I can hit them.\"The Masters is less than two months away with play beginning on Thursday, April 9.\n            ",

She is not part of the LA28 board with voting power and said the decision to keep Wasserman around as organizing chair was unfortunate.The International Olympic Committee has not commented on Wasserman and has pushed all questions to the LA28 board. \n\"I understand there are many conversations happening at this moment but I will not make any further comment,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams said Tuesday. \"This is obviously a matter for the board of LA28 still at this stage.\"Wasserman, 51, told employees last week in a memo he was \"deeply sorry for personal mistakes,\" referencing provocative emails sent to Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, that were released.Wasserman founded his industry-leading talent agency in 2002. According to his Olympics bio, Wasserman also serves as President and CEO of the Wasserman Foundation, a private family foundation founded in 1952 by his grandparents, Lew and Edie Wasserman. \nMany of Wasserman's clients dissociated from him last week in various public postings, including singer Chappell Roan and former USWNT star Abby Wambach.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Don't be surprised to see some potential nonconference rematches in the second round of the NCAA Tournament bracket when the field of 68 is revealed March 15 during Selection Selection Sunday on CBS.    One of the issues on the NCAA's radar for 2026 is how the proliferation of blockbuster games in November and December could make such meetings largely unavoidable during the bracketing process.    \"I think it's quite possible that we will see more of those nonconference repeat matchups this year as a result of the fact that there were more high-major versus high-major, ranked games in the top 25 this year,\" NCAA senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt told CBS Sports.    \n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Houston squanders chance to validate itself as fourth No. 1 seed as UConn elevates\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTrying to avoid rematchesHistorically, bracketing principles prioritized avoiding nonconference rematches through the Sweet 16.    \nCurrent NCAA bracketing principles state that nonconference rematches \"should be avoided in the First Four and first round.\" Avoiding potential second round rematches of such contests is listed as a \"secondary consideration\" for the committee.     That phrasing grants the committee some leeway to produce a bracket that contains potential Round of 32 rematches between the litany of projected NCAA Tournament teams that played each other in a historic November/December for college basketball.     There have been 175 regular season nonconference games played between high-major teams so far this season, and that tally will rise again Saturday, when No. 1 Michigan and No. 3 Duke square off. By contrast, there were 146 such games last season. Furthermore, there have been 44 nonconference games between ranked teams this season compared to 31 a year ago, per Sports Reference data.    \nGavitt called the trend \"great for college basketball overall\" and \"great for the tournament committee as well.\"     The upshot for the committee could be a decision matrix. Principles state the committee \"will not consider\" moving teams up or down a seed line to avoid a nonconference rematch. While the committee can — and often does — move teams within a seed line to avoid those rematches, that's not a perfect solution.    In some cases, the only alternative to avoiding a nonconference rematch is to create a conference rematch.\nMore marquee gamesHere is the rundown of how many ranked vs. ranked nonconference regular season games there have been over recent years. The 2020-21 season was omitted due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.        \t \t \t \t\t\t\t\tSeasonRanked vs. ranked   nonconference games2025-26442024-25312023-24282022-23332021-22172019-20252018-19262017-18222016-17302015-16212014-1524\t\t\t\t11-season average27.4That is an unavoidable reality in the evolving landscape of college basketball.    In the 2015 NCAA Tournament, there were 11 multi-bid leagues and no conference received more than seven bids. There were just 24 regular season nonconference games between ranked teams that season.    \nIn those days, before everyone was mashed together into one big pot of teams that largely just plays each other, adhering to stringent rematch rules was easier.     This year, just seven leagues are projected to get multiple bids, and four conferences are on pace to place eight or more teams in the field according to the CBS Sports Bracketology model. Additionally, there were a whopping 20 more nonconference games played between ranked teams this season than in the 2014-15 season.    Committee reacts to realignment by relaxing rulesBut amid the collapse of the Pac 12 and the consolidation of the \"high-major\" class into just five leagues, the committee leaned into the winds of change before last season.    \n\"I think the committee did a really good job anticipating what the result of conference realignment could mean in terms of the principles and procedures for establishing the bracket of the tournament,\" Gavitt said.    In 2025, the rub was that the committee produced a final bracket containing three potential second-round rematches between SEC teams, which was an unavoidable byproduct of that league receiving a historic 14 NCAA Tournament bids.     Principles permit such rematches, so long as the teams in question met only once prior to the NCAA Tournament. If they met twice, they can't play before the Sweet 16, and if they played three times they cannot meet until the Elite Eight.    \nGavitt emphasized that the committee also did not move a team up or down last year to avoid potential conference rematches. Doing so would only be a \"very last resort,\" and doing so to avoid a nonconference rematch is prohibited by bracketing principles.    Bottom line: seed integrity is more important than avoiding a second-round rematch.    \n            ",

I cherished every moment my cleats touched the grass. Every time I stepped onto the field, I was determined to leave a piece of myself in every snap.\" Woods signed a one-day contract Tuesday to retire as a member of the Los Angeles Rams. \nWoods had not appeared in a regular season game since 2024, his second year with the Houston Texans. He was initially drafted out of USC by the Buffalo Bills, where he played his first four seasons. \nWoods signed with the Rams in March 2017 ahead of coach Sean McVay's first season with the franchise. He appeared in just 12 games but posted a career-high (to that point) 56 catches for 781 yards with five touchdowns. He was the Rams' top wide receiver in 2018 when they made a run to the Super Bowl, where he had five catches for 70 yards. He finished the 2018 campaign with 1,219 yards and six touchdowns. Woods was also on the roster when the Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl 56, though he missed the game itself due to a torn ACL. Woods signed with the Tennessee Titans in 2022 and spent one season in Nashville before he signed his two-year contract with the Texans. \nWoods finished his career with 683 catches for 8,233 yards and 38 touchdowns.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Even in this era of conference expansion where college football teams can only play so many of their league companions each year, a plethora of repeat matchups dot the 2026 schedule. Whether it be via protected rivalries, luck of the scheduling matrix draw or the second legs of nonconference series, the upcoming campaign pits myriad familiar foes against each other. In many cases, these rematches are duplicates of last season's most memorable showdowns.For instance, Georgia and Ole Miss played a classic College Football Playoff game earlier this winter and will see each other in 2026 by way of the SEC's schedule rotation. The Bulldogs will thus have an opportunity to wage revenge on the team that eliminated them from national championship contention.Those SEC rivals are not alone in renewing a high-stakes matchup. A number of nonconference dates could have the same playoff implications that they carried early in the 2025 season, and rivalry clashes at the end of the campaign should again dictate which teams punch their tickets to the CFP and which fall short.Here are 12 of the best rematches on the 2026 schedule.Georgia at Ole Miss, Nov. 72025 Results: Georgia 43, Ole Miss 35 | Ole Miss 39, Georgia 34 (CFP quarterfinal)\nAfter two decades of infrequent meetings, Georgia and Ole Miss reacquainted themselves with a few classic showdowns over the last couple of years. Their CFP matchup was the most entertaining battle of the quarterfinal round and gave the Rebels some sweet revenge after they lost to the Bulldogs in the regular season. Trinidad Chambliss orchestrated a 22-3 Ole Miss run in a comeback victory that featured 30 combined points in the fourth quarter alone. It was among the more surprising outcomes of the postseason and sets the stage for another clash in conference play next season that should carry significant playoff implications.Ohio State at Indiana, Oct. 172025 Result: Indiana 13, Ohio State 10 (Big Ten Championship Game)The new blood surmounted the blue blood in the Big Ten Championship Game on its way to the first national championship in school history. Can Indiana make it two in a row against Ohio State and affirm its status as the class of the conference? Curt Cignetti has his work cut out for him in turning over a 16-0 roster but might have found his next star quarterback in Josh Hoover -- just what the Hoosiers need to go toe-to-toe with a Buckeye offense that once again features an otherworldly tandem in Julian Sayin and Jeremiah Smith.Georgia at Alabama, Oct. 102025 Results: Alabama 24, Georgia 21 | Georgia 28, Alabama 7 (SEC Championship Game)\nThe two most prolific programs in recent SEC history split their season series a year ago with Georgia getting the last laugh in a 28-7 victory in the conference championship game. They renew their budding rivalry early in the 2026 regular season with the potential to deliver another one of their patented thrillers. If one side has the potential to run away with it, though, it would be Georgia, which boasts more continuity at key positions with Gunner Stockton and Nate Frazier representing two of the most impactful returners in the SEC.Miami at Notre Dame, Nov. 72025 Result: Miami 27, Notre Dame 24Miami's three-point win over Notre Dame in the 2025 opener ultimately proved instrumental in the CFP selection process. It was also the source of massive controversy, as the committee cited the head-to-head result as a reason for launching the Hurricanes ahead of the Fighting Irish in the final rankings and into the bracket despite holding them in lower regard for much of the campaign. Notre Dame ought to be licking its chops looking at this revenge opportunity. Motivation will be no issue, and talent should not be, either, with Marcus Freeman bringing back a Heisman Trophy-contending quarterback in CJ Carr.LSU at Ole Miss, Sept. 192025 Result: Ole Miss 24, LSU 19Ole Miss grinded out a 24-19 win over LSU last year in what was, at the time, a monumental win over the No. 4 team in the country. The squads went in opposite directions from that point forward, prompting a coaching change for the Tigers and setting the stage for an awkward rematch in 2026. Lane Kiffin, now in charge at LSU after a drawn-out and dramatic exit from Ole Miss, is scheduled to open SEC play with his return to Vaught Hemingway Stadium in Week 3. Holdovers from last season's Rebels roster can make a statement against their old coach, who left them ahead of the CFP and rubbed the fanbase the wrong way on his walk out the door.\nOhio State at Texas, Sept. 122025 Result: Ohio State 14, Texas 7The Longhorns and Buckeyes will run it back in Week 2 this fall as two of the most highly favored national championship contenders -- just as they were last season when they entered this matchup as the Nos. 1 and 3 teams in the AP Top 25, respectively. Julian Sayin outplayed Arch Manning in a battle between two first-time starters last time around, but the latter hit his stride down the stretch and enters his redshirt junior year poised to push Sayin in the Heisman race. The winner will boast the best victory of the season to date and make a strong case to secure a No. 1 ranking.Arch Manning and Texas seek revenge against Ohio State in Week 2 after dropping last year's opener to the Buckeyes.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Arizona State at Texas Tech, Oct. 172025 Result: Arizona State 26, Texas Tech 22Texas Tech took only one loss prior to the 2025 CFP, and it was a 26-22 defeat on the road at Arizona State. While it did not prevent the Red Raiders from winning the Big 12 and securing a top-four seed in the playoff, it did emphasize that this rising power was not untouchable. A rematch against the Sun Devils should again be one of the toughest tests on Texas Tech's schedule, and from Kenny Dillingham's perspective, this contest is an opportunity to reestablish his Arizona State program as the best in the Big 12. Both squads inked top-15 transfer portal classes, as is the new standard in Tempe and Lubbock.Michigan at Ohio State, Nov. 282025 Result: Ohio State 27, Michigan 9Ohio State finally snapped its losing streak in The Game with a commanding 27-9 win over Michigan in which its stout defense did not surrender a touchdown. The search for payback suddenly shifts to the other side of the rivalry, where Kyle Whittingham will get his first taste of this famed series. The Wolverines would have been in the conversation for a CFP berth had they upset the Buckeyes last year, and the 2026 matchup could come with the same stakes as incoming transfers John Henry Daley and Smith Snowden bolster a roster that already features a potential breakout superstar in Bryce Underwood.\nOklahoma at Michigan, Sept. 122025 Result: Oklahoma 24, Michigan 13John Mateer looked as advertised as a premier transfer when he scored three touchdowns and compiled 344 total yards in Oklahoma's 24-13 win over Michigan. And on the other side of the ball, Brent Venables cooked up another one of his masterful schemes to confuse Bryce Underwood in his first college road game. All told, it was one of the Sooners' most impressive outings of the year and a trip to forget for the Wolverines. As the home-and-home series moves north to Ann Arbor, Michigan projects to be more competitive in round two with a more mature roster.Texas at Texas A&M, Nov. 272025 Result: Texas 27, Texas A&M 17Texas is 2-0 against Texas A&M since the revival of the Lone Star Showdown, and last year's win handed the Aggies their first loss of the season and held them out of the SEC Championship Game. That is rivalry fuel for the Aggies, who will host the Longhorns in the 2026 edition of the Black Friday tradition. Conference championship stakes should be in store for this matchup again with Steve Sarkisian pushing all his chips forward for a win-now campaign and Mike Elko bringing back his quarterback and most of his star-studded receiving corps.Florida State at Alabama, Sept. 192025 Result: Florida State 31, Alabama 17If one had to guess after Week 1 which of Alabama and Florida State would reach the CFP, they would have been included to assume the Seminoles returned to national prominence and punched a ticket to the postseason. The 31-17 win over the Crimson Tide was that impressive. Both teams' fortunes turned after that opener, though, and Alabama won 11 games the rest of the way while Florida State finished below .500. Mike Norvell has to turn things around to save his job and can build early momentum with a repeat win over the SEC power, and frankly, Kalen DeBoer can ill afford another disappointing loss if he is to avoid the hot seat.\nClemson at LSU, Sept. 52025 Result: LSU 17, Clemson 10The 17-10 win over Clemson in last year's opener looked like the first step for Brian Kelly in getting over the hump at LSU. Instead, things went off the rails and he lost his job in favor of Lane Kiffin. Now, Kiffin debuts against that same Clemson team in the second leg of the series. After signing the nation's top transfer class, Kiffin will be strongly favored to defeat the other Tigers, who continue to trend in the wrong direction under Dabo Swinney's watch. Significant roster turnover marked by losses of numerous NFL-caliber starters lends itself to pessimism for Clemson in 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tyreek Hill has no hard feelings following his release from the Miami Dolphins and wants the rest of the NFL to know he's anxious to get back on the field for the 2026 season. Grateful for the opportunity in Miami after four seasons with the franchise, the five-time All-Pro broke his silence this week after the roster move and said he is focused on a return to playing at an elite level.Hill's release comes ahead of contract guarantees that would've taken effect during the 2026 season. Hill suffered a devastating, season-ending knee injury in September and is expected to miss much of the offseason in recovery.\"Every chapter in life has taught me something. This one taught me leadership, resilience and mostly gratitude,\" Hill wrote Monday on Instagram. \"The love I have for this game is unexplainable. And right now, this offseason, for the first time ever, The Cheetah is all the way turned up and locked in. Focused. The Cheetah don't slow down, ever.\"Hill recorded 21 catches for 265 yards and a touchdown last season prior to injury, this coming after his production totals in 2024 marked the lowest of his career. By cutting Hill and three others on Monday in a series of cost-cutting decisions, the Dolphins saved nearly $70 million in cap space ahead of next season.\nHill said he felt \"loved\" in Miami and singled out Dolphins fans.\"Y'all are different man,\" Hill wrote. \"The way you showed up for us week after week, no matter the outcome — that love was real. I feel it thru out the city and every time I stepped into Hard Rock. Miami, you have became my home.\"Hill's first two seasons with the Dolphins were arguably the best of his career, at least individually altering a pair of 119-catch, 1,700-yard campaigns. His 13 touchdown catches in 2023 were the second-most in a single season during his career.Hill spent his first six years with the Kansas City Chiefs, one of the teams who could pursue him as an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career. Hill is an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and won a Super Bowl in Kansas City to end the 2019 season.\nHill's 11,363 career receiving yards rank ninth-most by a player in his first 10 seasons in NFL history, and his 28 touchdowns of 50 yards or longer are the fourth-most all time. Despite last season's injury, Hill should command considerable interest from a list of playoff-anxious suitors in need of a reliable target in the passing game.Potential landing spots could include the Bills, Chargers, 49ers and Patriots — teams who could all use assistance from a premier wideout who already have a franchise quarterback in tow for next season.Hill's medical evaluations during the court process will be vital to his future signings. After his knee dislocation in Week 4 last season, Hill underwent successful surgery for an ACL tear and is already walking without a brace.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A North Carolina district attorney says there's \"zero evidence\" backing up Duke coach Jon Scheyer's claims that several staffers were punched following the Blue Devils' loss to the Tar Heels on Feb. 7 during a court-storming after the final horn. Seconds after Seth Trimble's late 3-pointer pushed UNC to a dramatic rivalry win, Scheyer and his players were swarmed in what he described as a \"scary scene\" post-game, leading to an apology from Tar Heels athletic director Bubba Cunningham.Scheyer said several of his staff members were \"punched in the face\" by UNC fans. Jeff Nieman, the district attorney for Orange County (North Carolina), directed remarks toward Scheyer this week on social media, writing that \"someone with the power and influence of a major men's basketball coach should exercise more discretion before just saying things that can have real-world consequences.\"Scheyer was asked about Nieman's comments following Duke's win over Syracuse on Monday night.\"I would like to focus on Syracuse, but I'll tell you that I know what I saw and I know what happened with our staff after the game -- and that's the bottom line,\" Scheyer said. \"I'm not going to circle back or get into -- I don't know what was said or wasn't said or what people want to claim. But I know what happened, and I'm always going to support our staff in those situations and, again, I could have even said more, but I'm not going to do that.\"\n        \n            \n                Court storming halts final seconds of Carolina-Duke as Scheyer describes 'scary' scene; UNC AD apologizes\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTwo days after the loss to the Tar Heels, Scheyer said one of his staff members was injured after being \"trampled\" amid the chaotic environment and another \"looked like he had been in a complete brawl\" following the game. Scheyer also said his family was involved \"pushing people away\" while trying to get to the locker room.\nNieman, a North Carolina graduate, wrote this week that it's \"patently obvious\" none of that occurred. \nThe ACC later fined UNC $50,000 for violation of the league's event security policy. It was the Tar Heels' first offense.\"We accept the ACC's fine for having unauthorized people on the court before Duke and the officials could completely clear the floor on Saturday,\" UNC said in a statement after the fine was issued. \"The video we have reviewed confirms we followed our protocols to get Duke's players and bench personnel and the game officials off the floor safely. We will continue to review our protocols to provide the highest measures of safety in the event fans rush the court. We consider this matter closed and look forward to the rest of the season.\"\nThird-ranked Duke is 24-2 overall this season with its only ACC loss coming to the Tar Heels. Scheyer and the Blue Devils travel to top-ranked Michigan this weekend for a matchup with significant NCAA Tournament implications.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sometimes, the last impression you leave is the strongest. Vanderbilt dominated Texas from the jump on Thursday in a matchup of No. 1 seed hopefuls, leading by 12 points after the first quarter and by as many as 26 points before ultimately winning 86-70. It was the Longhorns' second-largest regular-season loss in the last five seasons. Still, they had a better resume than Vanderbilt in nearly every other metric, including the nation's two best wins against UCLA and South Carolina at neutral sites.Yet, Vanderbilt surprisingly received the final No. 1 seed in the selection committee's top-16 reveal on Saturday. But that No. 1 seed status for the Commodores was short-lived, as they fell on Sunday at Georgia while Texas picked up a road win at Tennessee. Vanderbilt is now our top No. 2 seed with head-to-head wins over both Texas and Michigan potentially looming large.For now, though, Texas's overall resume gives it the edge. Here's a look at how both teams compare entering this week.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    W-L24-324-3NET47WAB36Quad 110-36-3Head-to-HeadLostWonThe rest of the top-16 reveal went mostly as expected. UConn remained the No. 1 overall seed despite UCLA's sizable advantage in Quad-1 wins, and Duke was rewarded for more than two straight months of undefeated play by rising to the No. 10 overall

watch forMinnesota looks to grab hosting spotAfter debuting as a No. 9 seed in our first projections of the season, Minnesota has steadily risen and now finds itself on the No. 5 line, knocking on the door of a coveted top-four seed and hosting spot. It would be just the second time the Golden Gophers have ever received a top-four seed - they were a No. 3 seed in the 2004-05 season, recording a program-best 26 wins and reaching the Sweet 16.Minnesota has ranked in the top 20 of the NET rankings all season long but lacked the quality wins to justify a higher seed until its current eight-game win streak that began on Jan. 21 at Oregon. All four of Minnesota's Quad-1 wins have come during this stretch, which has seen the team rise to No. 9 in the NET and No. 21 in WAB.This week provides a golden opportunity to keep the pedal to the metal, with home games against current No. 3 seed Ohio State and No. 4 seed Michigan State. A win in the latter contest could be enough to wrestle the Spartans' hosting spot away.Columbia gives the Ivy League a second bid...for nowWhile Minnesota has risen from a No. 9 seed to a No. 5 seed over the past month, Princeton has done the opposite. After losing a second game of the season to Columbia, the two teams are now tied atop the Ivy League, and Columbia's head-to-head tiebreaker gives it the projected auto bid.With Princeton remaining in the current NCAA Tournament field, that means the Ivy League is a two-bid conference, taking away an at-large spot from the bubble (sorry, Stanford). However, it remains to be seen if that will hold, as Columbia almost certainly needs to win the Ivy League Tournament to reach March Madness.But even if the Lions do win the Ivy League Tournament, Princeton might find itself on the outside looking in if it loses another game in the regular season. The Tigers have four games left on the schedule, with a Quad-2 contest at Harvard being the main challenge. In the first meeting between the teams this season, Princeton needed overtime in order to win at home. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the NFL franchise tag window opening Tuesday, the Bengals now have a big decision to make with Trey Hendrickson. After an offseason of drama in 2025, the two sides could be headed down the same path in 2026.Last year, Hendrickson sat out most of training camp while trying to secure a new deal from the Bengals. The 31-year-old didn't land a long-term contract, but he did score a $13 million raise for 2025. His contract is now expiring, which means he's headed for free agency -- unless, of course, the Bengals hit him with the franchise tag.The Bengals essentially have three options this offseason when it comes to Hendrickson's future, so let's take a look at what they might do.Hit him with the franchise tagWhen Hendrickson received a raise last season, it would have made sense for him to ask for a no-tag clause, but that didn't happen, which means the Bengals can use the tag this year. Although the defensive end tag is expected to be about $27.2 million, Hendrickson will get more than that because players receive either the tag number or a 20% bump from their prior salary. A 20% bump would put his tag figure closer to $30.2 million.\nThe Bengals had one of the NFL's worst defenses last year, and one thing they could absolutely use is pass-rushing help. If they tag Hendrickson, they'd keep a top-tier pass rusher at a bargain rate. Although Hendrickson is 31, his age wouldn't be a major factor here because the commitment would be for just one season. If he had a big year in 2026, the Bengals could tag him again at a cost of $36.24 million. That would put him under team control for two years at $66.24 million total, with only $30.2 million guaranteed.Hendrickson played just seven games last season due to injury, so there is an injury concern. But again, if injuries resurfaced in 2026, the Bengals could simply let him walk in 2027.The downside is that the Bengals and Hendrickson don't appear to be on great terms. If he were tagged, both sides would have until mid-July to work out a long-term deal. If they couldn't reach one last offseason, it's unlikely they would this year, especially with Hendrickson a year older. A tag could set up another training camp holdout ... unless the Bengals tag him with another plan in mind, which takes us to our next option.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking the top 50 NFL free agents: Early look at the stars who could hit the market in March\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTag-and-tradeThis isn't something you see in the NFL very often, but definitely does happen. The Bengals could tag Hendrickson and then shop him. For Cincinnati, this would be the best-case scenario. Yes, they'd lose him, but they'd likely land one or two draft picks they could use to rebuild their defense.They'd need a trade partner, but that shouldn't be difficult. Nearly every team is looking to improve its pass rush, and the NFL Scouting Combine falls within the two-week tag window. That gives the Bengals a chance to gauge Hendrickson's market in Indianapolis before the window closes March 3. They also wouldn't have to trade him immediately; they could wait for the best offer.A notable recent tag-and-trade came in 2022 when the Packers tagged Davante Adams, who definitely did NOT want to be tagged. Less than 10 days later, he was traded to Las Vegas. Defensively, tagged-and-traded players in recent years include Chandler Jones (2022), Frank Clark (2019) and Dee Ford (2019).\nAlthough I think this makes a lot of sense for the Bengals, Pete Prisco doesn't agree. \"That's always risky if you try and do that because you could get stuck with him,\" Prisco said Tuesday on CBS Sports HQ. \nThe Bengals might not get ideal compensation, but it's highly unlikely they'd get stuck. In a worst-case scenario, they'd accept the best available offer, even if they didn't love it.\nCincinnati's front office isn't known for aggressive moves like this, but it also wasn't known for in-season trades -- and it pulled off a notable one in October when it acquired Joe Flacco. Basically, don't rule this out.Let him walkIf the Bengals want a drama-free offseason, this is the simplest solution. Instead of tagging Hendrickson, they'd let him leave in free agency. Using the tag would immediately eat up $30.2 million in cap space, a massive number for a team with a ton of holes to fill in free agency, especially on defense.The upside of letting him walk is financial flexibility. The downside is getting nothing in return. Hendrickson led the NFL in sacks in 2024, and pass rushers are always in demand. Letting him leave empty-handed wouldn't be ideal, but it would allow both sides to move on immediately. (The Bengals could potentially receive a compensatory pick if Hendrickson signed with another team, but that would depend on several factors.)\nPossible landing spotsIf Hendrickson reaches free agency or gets traded, he'll be with a new team in 2026. So where could he land?\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The best landing spot might be just 115 miles west of Cincinnati. The Colts need pass-rush help, and a move would reunite Hendrickson with former Bengals defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo, now the Colts' DC. After signing with the Bengals in 2021, Hendrickson blossomed under Anarumo, recording at least 14 sacks in three of four seasons -- including 17.5 in both 2023 and 2024.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The 49ers finished with the NFL's fewest sacks last year (20), and they need to do anything they can to get some help in the pass-rushing department.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Patriots made a big splash in free agency last offseason, and with a healthy amount of salary cap space, it wouldn't be surprising if they get aggressive again this year. The Patriots actually posted the league's worst sack differential last year, allowing 48 while recording 35. Mike Vrabel will be looking for pass-rush upgrades.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    The Titans have more cap space than anyone. If Hendrickson chases the biggest paycheck, this fit makes sense. And let's not forget: Robert Saleh is a defensive coach, so he'll certainly be looking for some game wreckers on that side of the ball.For any team that might be interested in Hendrickson, Prisco did issue a stern warning.\n\"Here's the problem with Trey Hendrickson: Injury and age,\" Prisco said. \"You're talking about a guy who missed time last year and you're also talking about a guy who's 31 years old, but the allure and attraction of a pass-rusher like him will set the market for him.\" Despite missing 10 games last season, Prisco still expects the 2024 sack leader to garner significant interest.I think there's going to be teams interested in adding him. There's going to be a lot of teams who are pass-rush needy. All you have to do is go back to the last two Super Bowls and who won them: Well, the Eagles, they could rush the passer. The Seattle Seahawks, they could rush the passer. A lot of teams need that guy. He's going to have a big market even though he's 31. I think there will be caution involved with the contract. You can't give him a megadeal because of the age, but he's going to get some kind of deal, probably a three-year deal, that's going to see him end up with some team that needs pass-rush help.Right now, the Bengals hold all the leverage. If Hendrickson hits free agency, he'll have a market -- but there's no guarantee he gets there since Cincinnati can simply tag him. This will be an interesting situation to watch over the next few weeks.\n            ",

That is not the case for 2026, as the schedule is loaded with intriguing fights in January and February.The early highlight of the schedule was Shakur Stevenson's domination of Teofimo Lopez Jr. to win the WBO junior welterweight championship. It was a true pound-for-pound performance from Stevenson, who won nearly every second of a fight against the most dangerous foe of his career.A massive DAZN PPV is set for Feb. 21 with a terrific welterweight title main event. Champion Mario Barrios is set to defend his belt against Ryan Garcia in a fight sure to deliver action. Barrios is coming off a disappointing draw against Manny Pacquiao in Pacquiao's return to the ring. Similarly, Garcia suffered a very disappointing loss in his most recent outing, dropping a decision to Rolando Romero in Times Square in a fight where Garcia showed no urgency bell-to-bell. Now, both men have a chance to get their careers back on track when they clash in Las Vegas.There are many other title fights, featuring top fighters, which have created a very intriguing kickoff to the sport for 2026.Take a look at the calendar for 2026 below.\nNote: This will be updated constantly with changes and additions.

Punk defends his world heavyweight title against Finn Balor, plus two superstars will punch their tickets to WrestleMania 42.Punk has his hands full as the world heavyweight champion. He'll rematch Finn Balor at Elimination Chamber, the last major stop before WrestleMania. If he leaves Chicago with his champion status intact, Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns awaits him in Las Vegas.Elimination Chamber's two titular matches will also take place. The superstars who emerge from their respective steel structures victorious will earn world title matches at WrestleMania. Randy Orton, LA Knight and Cody Rhodes are among those who've qualified for a shot at the undisputed WWE title. Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka will compete with two other women for a shot at one of the two women's world titles as Royal Rumble winner Liv Morgan has still yet to make her decision on who she will face.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Feb. 28 with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.\nElimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. TBA vs. TBA: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Cody Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Je'Evon Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. TBA vs. TBA: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Alexa Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie.\n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsUndisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Jacob Fatu: WWE subverted expectations by booking Rhodes and Fatu in the same Elimination Chamber qualifying match. All signs pointed to an eventual triple threat match between them and McIntyre. Rhodes is still the favorite to challenge McIntyre at WrestleMania. Maybe Fatu loses his qualifying match and earns a separate title shot against McIntyre. It seems odd to reward Fatu with a title opportunity if he loses his upcoming qualifier match. Whatever direction WWE takes, expect Fatu to orbit McIntyre in the next few months.\n            ",

Former Nuggets players Bill Hanzlik posted on X that Moe \"passed away peacefully holding the hand of his wife.\"\"Coach Moe was a one of a kind leader and person who spearheaded one of the most successful and exciting decades in Nuggets history,\" the Nuggets said as part of a statement. \"He will forever be loved and remembered by Nuggets fans and his banner commemorating his 432 career victories as head coach will hang in the rafters to forever honor his incredible legacy.\"\nMoe started his coaching career as an assistant in the ABA before becoming the San Antonio Spurs coach in 1976-77, the franchise's inaugural NBA season. The Spurs made the playoffs in each of Moe's first three seasons before he was fired late in the 1979-80 season.After starting the 1980-81 season as a Denver assistant, he got elevated to head coach, and stayed in that role until 1990. Moe's fast-paced, run-and-gun teams led the league scoring six times across his 10 seasons. His 432 wins were a franchise record until Michael Malone passed him in 2024.\nMoe then moved to the Philadelphia 76ers, but he was fired after a 19-37 start to his first season. He returned to Denver in the 2000s as an assistant coach. Former Nuggets coach George Karl, whom Moe worked under, also took to X following Moe's death.\nA two-time All-ACC selection at North Carolina, Moe's college career ended due to his association with a point shaving scandal; there was no evidence he was involved in fixing games, but he did admit to taking money from a conspirator. Moe was selected in the 1960 NBA Draft by the Detroit Pistons and in 1961 by the Chicago Packers, but due to the scandal, his NBA career was delayed.\nHe eventually began his professional basketball career in Italy in 1965 and joined the ABA's New Orleans Buccaneers in 1967. He was an ABA All-Star his first year as well as the next two years with the Oakland Oaks -- who won the 1968-69 ABA title -- and the Carolina Cougars, respectively. He also finished in the top 10 in MVP voting all three years. He spent his last two years as a player with the Virginia Squires before beginning his coaching career.\n            \n    ",

    "description": "\n        The Champions League knockout playoff between Benfica and Real Madrid was delayed by 10 minutes on Tuesday night after Vinicius Junior report",
    "body": "\n        The Champions League knockout playoff between Benfica and Real Madrid was delayed by 10 minutes on Tuesday night after Vinicius Junior reported an alleged racial incident. The Brazil attacker had just scored an outstanding opening goal in the 50th minute of the match in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz when anger built among home supporters, objects raining down on the pitch as Vinicius celebrated by the corner flag. The exuberance of his celebrations earned Vinicius a yellow card from referee Francois Letexier while tensions frayed between both sets of players.It was soon after that Vinicius sprinted over to Letexier and was seen pointing at Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni. The French referee made a gesture of crossed arms above his head, an initiative adopted by FIFA in 2024 to allow players and officials to signal that they believe racist abuse has taken place on the field. Television cameras caught Benfica forward Gianluca Prestianni speaking to Vinicius with his jersey covering his mouth; the Real Madrid man appeared to subsequently make reference to that while speaking to Letexier. Posting on his Instagram stories after the game, Vinicius said: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened today is new in my life and my family's.\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\nSpeaking after the game, several visiting players also alleged that Prestianni had racially abused their teammate. \"This can't happen,\" Aurelien Tchouameni told Movistar. \"Vini told us that the kid called him a monkey. He said he didn't say anything...\"Federico Valverde added, \"We don't know for sure, but according to all the teammates who were nearby, he said something nasty that shouldn't be said. We've been fighting for this for a long time. Vini has fought for this, and if this keeps happening, it's a shame that a camera didn't record it. \"If you cover your mouth to say something, it means what you're saying isn't right. It's a shame. I'm proud of the teammates who defended Vini and proud of Vini for carrying on.\"\nMeanwhile, a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card as tempers built across the field. Vinicius was spotted in an embrace with Jose Mourinho before sitting on the Madrid bench, the delay to proceedings running to 10 minutes before the match was resumed at the hour mark.Speaking after the game, Mourinho, who was sent off for a separate incident, revealed that he had told Vinicius that \"the last thing [Benfica] is is racist,\" pointing to the fact that their greatest ever player, Eusebio, was black. The Benfica head coach said he wished to remain \"independent\" in regards to what may have been said by Prestianni but criticised Vinicius for his celebrations.\"Unfortunately, he was not just happy to score the goal,\" Mourinho told Amazon. \"When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"\nWhen it was put to the former Real Madrid manager that Vinicius had suffered racist abuse on several other occasions during his career, Mourinho said, \"Stadiums that Vinicius plays in, something happens, always.\"Though there were no further flashpoints between the players, Vinicius' every touch was booed by the Estadio da Luz and the game was stopped momentarily in the 96th minute as items were thrown onto the pitch by supporters and once again in the 103rd minute as 12 minutes of added time were issued. Madrid would ultimately hold onto their lead with relative ease.\"Disgraceful to the sport,\" was how Trent Alexander-Arnold described the incident to CBS Sports. \"It's disappointing. It's ruined the night. It's a disgrace to the sport and society. There's no place for it.\n\"If incidents like this do happen, we can only deal with it like we did tonight. Very proud of the team, the club and the squad, how everyone reacted and got around Vini. You can see it's something upsetting and disappointing. We reacted the right way, we kept our heads and kept calm. We defended each other and we also played very well.\"Vinicius has been racially abused on multiple occasions during his time as a Real Madrid player, particularly in 2023, when the incidents included an effigy of him being hung on a bridge in the Spanish capital before a match against Atletico Madrid. His campaigns against such intolerance and hatred have won the 25-year-old widespread admiration in the footballing world and beyond, with the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul implementing \"Vinicius Junior laws\" that will see sporting contests suspended over incidents of racist abuse.The Brazilian football federation swiftly issued a statement of support for their star player. \n\"The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) stands in solidarity with Vinicius Junior, victim of yet another act of racism this Tuesday, after scoring for Real Madrid against Benfica in Lisbon. Racism is a crime. It is unacceptable. It cannot exist in football or anywhere else,\" the statement read.\"Vini, you are not alone. Your action in activating the protocol is an example of courage and dignity. We are proud of you. We will remain firm in the fight against all forms of discrimination. We are by your side. Always.\"\n            ",

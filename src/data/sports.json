    "body": "\n        Auburn will be out to make history in the SEC's greatest rivalry on Saturday when the Tigers host No. 10 Alabama in a seismic showdown with far-reaching implications. Never in the Iron Bowl's expansive history has a top-10 Alabama team traveled to face an unranked Auburn team inside Jordan-Hare Stadium and lost. If that changes in 2025, the fallout will be dire for Alabama. The Crimson Tide looked like a near-lock to make the College Football Playoff just two weeks ago. Then came a loss to Oklahoma, which has eliminated Bama's margin for error as it heads into a venue where things are never easy. With a win, Alabama (9-2, 6-1 SEC) could reach the SEC Championship Game and cement its status as a CFP team.However, a loss would leave second-year coach Kalen DeBoer with consecutive nine-win regular seasons and an 0-for-2 mark on reaching the 12-team playoff. Furor would intensify to an uncomfortable degree. The Crimson Tide enter as just 6-point favorites against their hated in-state foe, despite the fact that Auburn is 5-6 (1-6) and playing under interim coach D.J. Durkin.But strange things tend to happen when this game is contested on The Plains. The Crimson Tide's last two wins at Auburn in 2023 and 2021 came by a combined total of five points against Tigers teams that finished just 6-7. Given the stakes and the narrow line, it would be no surprise if we're in for another thriller in 2025.\nWhere to watch Alabama vs. Auburn liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Jordan-Hare Stadium -- Auburn, AlabamaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow along for LIVE updates, highlights and analysis from the Iron Bowl.   Alabama vs. Auburn: Need to know  Auburn's improved offense: Auburn played its best offensive game of the season in its first game following Hugh Freeze's firing. Though the Tigers fell 45-38 in overtime at Vanderbilt, they showed a new and more exciting gear with Ashton Daniels unleashed as the starting quarterback and offensive coordinator Derrick Nix calling the plays. Daniels rested in last week's win over Mercer to help preserve his redshirt year, but he'll be in the lineup against the Crimson Tide. Another beneficiary of Auburn's offensive progression following Freeze's firing has been receiver Cam Coleman. The star sophomore made 10 catches for 143 yards and a touchdown against Vandy.Ty Simpson's turnovers: After thriving as a clutch playmaker and fierce protector of the football during an eight-game winning streak, Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson has picked up a case of the \"whoopsie daisies\" as of late. He was intercepted and fumbled in the Crimson Tide's loss to Oklahoma and was also picked off twice in the first half of last week's win over Eastern Illinois. While Simpson's play unquestionably helped elevate Alabama after a stunning Week 1 loss at Florida State, his recent regression is a concern heading into the Iron Bowl. For better or worse, the verdict on his redshirt junior season will be rendered largely based on his performance against Auburn.\nOnly once before: It's never happened inside Jordan-Hare Stadium before, but there is one example from this rivalry's illustrious history of a top-10 Alabama team losing to an unranked Auburn squad. It came in 2002, when a 7-4 Auburn team knocked off No. 9 Alabama 17-7 during Dennis Franchione's second and final season as coach. Bama was serving a postseason ban that year, which only magnified the Auburn game's significance as the barometer of a successful season. The Tigers jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead and ended Alabama's five-game winning streak.Alabama vs. Auburn prediction, picks\nAlabama quarterback Ty Simpson has been a bit rickety as of late, but he's successfully navigated a number of tense situations involving serious game pressure and won't be rattled by this environment. Auburn's quarterback group doesn't bring the same winning pedigree, and while the Tigers are a threat to run the football, Bama's run defense has improved significantly in the season's second half. The Tigers will be able to move the football some, but the Crimson Tide are masters of creating big turnovers and coming up with clutch stops. If Simpson returns to form, Alabama can gain second-half separation.

    "body": "\n        The only thing that's better than Thanksgiving dinner is when you can break open the leftovers. As we gear up for a jam-packed Sunday slate of NFL action, there's no better time to dive into those final pieces of turkey while firing off some last-minute bets in the process. Given that we just went through a busy Thanksgiving and Black Friday allotment of games, it's easy to not have your eye on the ball in terms of how to wager for the rest of Week 13. And that's where we come in. Below, we're going to highlight our best bets for the remaining games on the slate and give out a pick for every other contest on the docket. One common theme that you'll find in our best bets is that we're backing the underdogs to cover, which would be a continuation of what we've seen earlier in Week 13 as all four prior matchups saw the underdog not only cover, pull off the outright upset. NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

Houston's defense is playing as well as any unit in the NFL right now. They rank first in the NFL in total yards per game allowed (264.3) and passer rating allowed (72.2), along with ranking second in points per game allowed (16.5). Meanwhile, Daniel Jones hasn't been as lights out as he was to begin the season. Over his last three starts, Jones has an 83.0 passer rating with five total touchdowns and seven turnovers compared to the 109.5 passer rating, 17 total touchdowns, and three turnovers in the eight games before that. This is the type of defense that can highlight the recent lull from Jones. While I think Indy can find a way to pull this out at home, it'll be within the number, and we'll be asking a lot of questions about this team's ceiling coming out of the contest. Projected score: Colts 24, Texans 21The pick: Texans +3.5Las Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles ChargersSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)The Raiders are in a bad way, falling to 2-9 on the season last week following a loss to the Browns, which led to the firing of offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. It's possible that this move provides a momentary boost for the unit in this divisional matchup, but this pick has more to do with questions surrounding the Chargers than anything else. Let's not forget that this team came out extraordinarily flat in a 35-6 loss to the Jaguars before the Week 12 bye. While they'll be well-rested for this game, it doesn't necessarily mean Justin Herbert will be better protected. They are still without starting left tackle Joe Alt for the year, and Herbert's numbers have dipped in his absence. Without Alt, Herbert is averaging 6.4 yards per attempt and has eight touchdowns with six interceptions compared to the 8.3 yards per attempt average, 11 touchdowns, and three interceptions with him. Las Vegas has a pass rusher led by Maxx Crosby who can continue to give Herbert fits, so this stays within a double-digit game. Projected score: Chargers 23, Raiders 17The pick: Raiders +9.5San Francisco 49ers at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS | Paramount+)If it were up to Brock Purdy, the 49ers would've lost in Week 12. The 49ers quarterback tossed three first-half interceptions against the Panthers on Monday night, but was bailed out by his defense that allowed just three points off those turnovers en route to a win. And Purdy's struggles go beyond just this game as he's thrown seven interceptions in four starts this season overall. Now, he's asked to shake that off against a Browns defense that has been utterly dominant this season and is coming off a 10-sack performance in Week 12 against the Raiders. On the year, the unit is top three in the league in yards per game allowed (273.0), passing yards per game allowed (170.7), sacks (42), and third-down efficiency (34.5% opponent conversion rate). If Cleveland continues to play at that level, Purdy's issues could persist and keep the Browns within range of an upset. \nProjected score: 49ers 23, Browns 20The pick: Browns +4.5New York Giants at New England PatriotsMonday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN | Fubo, try for free)The Patriots enter Week 13 atop the AFC as the No. 1 seed in the conference and the first club to reach 10 wins on the year. While they were able to notch a ninth straight win over the Bengals last week, it came at a cost. The entire left side of their offensive line went down due to injury, and both left tackle Will Campbell and left guard Jared Wilson are expected to miss time, including Monday's contest. One of the strengths of New York this season has been its front, which is headlined by Brian Burns (13 sacks). With reserves set to man Drake Maye's blindside, there's an opportunity for Burns, Abdul Carter, and others to tee off and throw the Patriots offense off the track. If they can do that, it'll help Jaxson Dart stay within the spread in his return to action.Projected score: Patriots 24, Giants 20The pick: Giants +7Rest of the bunchJaguars at TitansProjected score: Jaguars 27, Titans 17The pick: Jaguars -6Saints at DolphinsProjected score: Dolphins 28, Saints 20The pick: Dolphins -5.5Falcons at JetsProjected score: Falcons 24, Jets 17The pick: Falcons -2.5Cardinals at BuccaneersProjected score: Cardinals 24, Buccaneers 21The pick: Cardinals +3.5\nRams at PanthersProjected score: Rams 30, Panthers 17The pick: Rams -10Vikings at SeahawksProjected score: Seahawks 27, Vikings 14The pick: Seahawks -11.5Bills at SteelersProjected score: Bills 30, Steelers 21The pick: Bills -3Broncos at CommandersProjected score: Broncos 27, Commanders 20The pick: Broncos -5.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        ANN ARBOR, Michigan -- Ryan Day didn't need to overthink himself to finally snap the four-game skid that had consumed him. He just needed to be himself.Pressure tends to bring out the best or worst in coaches. For Ohio State, a dangerous mix of those two resulted in a bizarre identity crisis: a four-game losing streak in \"The Game\" but a 52-1 record against every other Big Ten team.On Saturday, Day ditched the overcorrections and went back to what works. Michigan had no counter.\"I don't think there was any doubt when we walked into the stadium what was going to happen,\" Day declared after the 27-9 victory.\nA year after Ohio State tried to reinvent itself for one opponent and prove a point against Michigan by abandoning a high-flying offense to play bully ball, the coach kept it simple: just be a Buckeye.Julian Sayin threw howitzers through the air, dropping laser-guided bombs for two incredible touchdown catches by super receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate. Then the Buckeyes went to the ground, bulldozing Michigan and marching through the snow on a single possession to prove a point: these Buckeyes are not just better, they're bigger and stronger than the Wolverines.A 20-play drive over the course of 11 minutes, 56 seconds in the second half -- easily the longest drive of the season -- in the driving snow was more of a statement than any flag panting at midfield would have been.\n\"We wanted to end the game on our terms,\" Sayin said.\n        \n            \n                Ohio State's Julian Sayin finally got to make his Heisman case in Buckeyes' emphatic win over Michigan\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd, no, Ohio State didn't plant its flag or stomp on the block \"M\" at midfield. Day made sure of that, motioning a raucous group of Buckeyes back to the sideline after the game. Day had a lot to say after finally beating his rival for the first time since 2019, but he bit his lip, adding, \"The best thing to do is win with humility.\"Then again, maybe this is just the start of a new routine and winning streak in the sport's fiercest rivalry.\"When you think about where we were at this point last year to all the way now, there's been a lot of great football,\" Day said.\nMaybe it was that 13-10 loss last year inside a bone-chilling Ohio Stadium that awakened Day. Something flipped. Sixteen straight wins. A national title. Now a 12-0 record after losing 14 players to the NFL Draft. This shouldn't make sense, but it does at Ohio State. No team is hotter or better because of Ohio State's reluctance to stray from a self-determined identity. Eleven straight wins by double digits. A defense for a generation. All of that will be challenged next week in the Big Ten Championship Game against undefeated Indiana, a team hammering opponents by an average of 33.4 points, the widest margin in the sport since Florida State won the national title in 2013.For now, Day should live in the moment. He should celebrate. A year ago, fans turned on the coach, booing him out of Ohio State, demanding answers after losing a fourth straight to Michigan and missing the Big Ten Championship. The outside noise was so loud, Day's family hired security to guard their home. \nFour years is a lifetime in college football, but a win against a rival can erase many bad memories.\"You can see it in my face the last couple years,\" Day said. \"You feel like you're letting everybody down. That's just not a good feeling. You work like hell to make sure that you do everything you can to get your guys prepared. That's all you can do. That's exactly what happened here.\"Ohio State's offense may get the praise, but its defense has proven to be one of the best of the last 50 years. No opponent has scored 17 points in this 12-game season, a first in the sport since 1975 (Florida). \nThe offense will get headlines, but the defense has been the anchor of the entire season. No opponent reached 17 points through 12 games -- something no FBS team has done since 1975 Florida. Michigan came nowhere close. Outside of an opening burst and Sayin's lone mistake, the Wolverines were swallowed whole: 39 total yards in the second half, minus-8 rushing after racking up 108 before halftime.\n        \n            \n                2025 Big Ten Championship Game: Ohio State vs. Indiana set for monumental clash in Indianapolis\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We knew whatever they brought to us we were going to stop,\" defensive end Caden Curry said.Ohio State outgained Michigan 419-163 and took its rival's will somewhere deep under the snow.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, as the Buckeyes churned through their marathon drive, linebacker Sonny Styles glanced at teammate Payton Pierce and soaked in the moment. The snow, the stakes, the rivalry.\"I'm playing in 'The Game' right now,\" Styles said. Both teams trying to get to the Big Ten Championship. It's snowing. It's the end of November. It's the stuff you dream about.\"The domination all season may seem like a dream, but this is Ohio State. The Buckeyes are fully comfortable in their skin, fully aware of their power. \n\"We definitely got way more on the table and we just have so much more to prove,\" Curry said. \"This team has such a great story that needs to be told.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        WWE's biggest superstars are calling for reinforcements. Survivor Series takes place in San Diego with two blockbuster WarGames matches. CM Punk, AJ Lee, Roman Reigns, Becky Lynch, and Brock Lesnar are among the main event stars taking part.The teams could provide some interesting drama, both internally and externally. Reigns, Rhodes and Punk have their own storyline developing as Reigns has his eyes on getting back in the world title scene while being joined by his cousins, The Usos, to form the five-man team. Meanwhile, Paul Heyman has assembled a powerhouse unit, headlined by Lesnar, who is joined by Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed.On the women's side, Lee, Ripley, Flair, Alexa Bliss and Iyo Sky will have their hands full with Nia Jax Lash Legend Asuka, Kairi Sane and Lynch.Plus, John Cena takes part in his final PPV-level event when he looks to defend his newly won intercontinental title against the man he won it from in Dominik Mysterio. And Stephanie Vaquer looks to defend the women's world championship against Hall of Famer Nikki Bella.With so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what  the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action  goes down in San Diego.\n2025 WWE Crown Jewel predictionsCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, and The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) vs. Brock Lesnar, Drew McIntyre, and The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul) (WarGames match): I fear WWE leans on its classic playbook: Lesnar comes, Lesnar smashes, Lesnar leaves. The company's booking philosophy suggests that Lesnar will be last to enter the fray. He's the biggest star among The Vision's team, and his matches are typically short. The Vision's success in elevating its members is up for debate, but they definitely benefit from a win more than their opponents do. Punk, Reigns and Rhodes are essentially bulletproof. The Vision and McIntyre, specifically, are overdue for a win. Pick: The Vision wins -- Shakiel Mahjouri (also Brent Brookhouse)Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: I see no reason for Cena to win this match. The win over Mysterio was more of a career achievement award, allowing Cena to win the one title he had never held and become a grand slam champion. But Cena doesn't need the belt heading into his final match, and Mysterio holding a win over Cena would be perfect for Mysterio's character. He would be so obnoxious about defeating Cena that it would be a staple talking point in his promos for at least a year. That alone is a good enough reason for Mysterio to get the victory. Sometimes the decision is as simple as what benefits the promotion moving forward. Pick: Mysterio wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)AJ Lee, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair, IYO SKY, and Rhea Ripley vs. Becky Lynch, Lash Legend, Nia Jax, and The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane) (WarGames match): If WWE wants to level out The Vision's victory in the main event, they can give the heroes a win in the women's WarGames match. No one on Lynch's team desperately needs a victory, so it's hard to picture them edging out the fan favorites. Lee's team also has more main event stars, meaning one or two of them can parlay a victory into a world title program on Raw or SmackDown. Pick: Team AJ wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella's sole purpose here is name recognition. She's a semi-retired, part-time act coming off a rough return against Becky Lynch. By contrast, Vaquer is a talented full-time act with potential to become a major star for the company. Beating a WWE Hall of Famer will be a great feather in Vaquer's cap. Pick: Vaquer wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin had one final message for Ole Miss on the way out the door: You're just not good enough. Don't confuse his desire to coach in the College Football Playoff with actual remorse. By choosing to leave Ole Miss for fellow SEC foe LSU, as Yahoo reported he intends to do, Kiffin is saying with his entire chest that he can't win a national championship in Oxford, Mississippi. This is despite the Rebels being a lock for the CFP at 11-1 overall during what is by far Kiffin's best season as a head coach.  \n        \n            \n                Latest on Jon Sumrall and Florida, Lane Kiffin and other coaching search news\n                \n                    Matt Zenitz                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSomeone who rejects a program so openly doesn't deserve a chance to coach that team in the playoff. It shouldn't even be a discussion.If Kiffin wants to take LSU, he should move to Baton Rouge immediately.  Let one of the Rebels remaining coaches -- be it a Pete Golding or a Joe Judge -- lead the playoff charge. Teams feed off belief. If Kiffin actually wants to coach in the playoff, he has an easy option to do so. He could stay with Ole Miss. It's unreasonable to expect Ole Miss would let him finish out the season and then leave for competitor, especially in an era where so many of his players could go with him. \nFrankly, all of this is an ironic calculus by Kiffin given Oxford is where he experienced a career rebirth. Remember, for all Kiffin's recent success and his soon-to-be record-setting pay bump, his history as a coach is littered with failure. He escaped in the middle of the night in Knoxville after just one 7-6 season. He got fired on a tarmac as USC's head coach. Nick Saban even fired Kiffin ahead of a national championship game when Kiffin couldn't juggle his offensive coordinator duties with his next role as FAU's head coach. Other than a few seasons in Boca Raton, Oxford is the only place where Kiffin's had any real extended success on the big stage as a decision maker. \nIn Mississippi, Kiffin found a program that embraced his eccentric nature. Athletic director Keith Carter gave Kiffin all the leeway possible to run the Rebels as he saw fit. Ole Miss' collective emerged as an industry leader in the NIL era, allowing the Rebels to consistently reel in top portal classes Does Ole Miss have the recruiting firepower of a LSU, Alabama or Georgia? Obviously not. The history of Rebels football isn't there. The high-end money of a program like Oregon or Miami isn't either. There's a reason why the Rebels usually sign top 20 classes instead of top 10. But it's not as if Kiffin's ever been a superstar recruiter. He's a showy one. He wins on social media. But those who've worked with Kiffin wouldn't describe him as a recruiting maniac like his mentor Saban or his friend Kirby Smart. \nYou can get away with that at Ole Miss. The fans there were thrilled with Kiffin's portal-first approach. It will be much more difficult in Baton Rouge where elite classes are expected and every recruiting battle is a live-or-die moment for the Tigers community. That's the most confusing thing about Kiffin flirting with LSU and Florida so openly. \nYou could argue he already found his football soul mate. There's a reason Kirk Fertenz is in Year 27 at Iowa or that Steve Spurrier had so much success in 12 years at Florida. They were (are) great football coaches, yes. But their personality and style fit their school. Kiffin and Ole Miss seemed to be an ideal match. Nobody embraced Kiffin more than the Rebels faithful. And you know how he repaid that? With a wandering eye toward Auburn way back in 2022 and then Florida and LSU this time around. Those who've worked for Kiffin have expected him to chase a bigger SEC job for years. So, I'd just ask: Why doesn't Kiffin believe more in himself? The Rebels are just four games away from the ultimate goal in college football. Kiffin's already managed four double-digit win seasons in his last five years in Oxford. It's taken LSU 13 years to have that many double-digit win efforts. \nKiffin didn't have to leave Oxford to chase what he's looking for. That's why the thought of Kiffin getting to coach the Rebels in the playoff is so absurd.Why would Ole Miss, a program on the verge of history, let someone who's showed so little faith in the program keep leading it? \n            ",

An expansion franchise, San Diego are redefining what an expansion side can do under manager Mikey Varas, and behind the hot form of newcomer of the year Anders Dreyer, they'll host a Western Conference final with quite a bit of star power in tow.How to watch San Diego FC vs. Vancouver Whitecaps, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 9 p.m. ETLocation: Snapdragon Stadium -- San Diego, Calif.Live stream: MLS Season PassOdds: San Diego FC +140; Draw +250; Vancouver Whitecaps +175Vancouver and manager Jesper Sorensen have had to withstand injuries and sales of key cogs of the team, but with Sebastian Berhalter leading the charge in midfield and Thomas Muller's hot form since joining midseason as a free agent. Including the playoffs, Muller has eight goals and three assists in only 10 appearances for the squad, and in a playoff scene that has been largely dominated by Lionel Messi in the Eastern Conference, he's making sure that his impact is felt while the Whitecaps look to bring Vancouver its first major professional title in sports.They did win the North American Soccer League in 1979, defeating the Tampa Bay Rowdies, but outside of the Canadian Cup, silverware has been hard to come by since. The Whitecaps made it to the Concacaf Champions Cup final this season under Sorensen, where they fell to Cruz Azul. That 5-0 loss will be far in the past, but it is a game that will help prepare the Whitecaps for an important match away from home with a trip to the MLS Cup on the line.San Diego are only the second expansion team in MLS history to reach a conference final, and they've taken down whatever has been in their path. Dreyer's impact has been important but so has Varas's trust in youth. Remember, 19-year-old Luca Bombino and 20-year-old Manu Duah have been critical parts of the defense, and they'll have an important job containing Brian White and the Vancouver attack. Dreyer has also scored four goals and assisted two more during the playoffs\nThis will be the third meeting between the two, with San Diego winning one and the other ending in a draw. There's quite a lot on the line as if Inter Miami fall to New York City FC, the winner of this match will host MLS Cup.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We're still on Thanksgiving weekend, so it figures to remain a slow period of the Major League Baseball offseason before things, hopefully, start to pick up sometime next week. Still, there's been a notable move along with a few rumors, so let's round everything up. Orioles get their closerThe Orioles were looking for a closer this offseason and they appear to have landed their man. They are in agreement with right-hander Ryan Helsley on a two-year deal for $28 million, per The Athletic. There had been talk that Helsley might convert to a starter for next season, but the report indicates Helsley is now slotted as the closer for the Orioles.\nHelsley, 31, was one of the best closers in baseball in 2024 and was still productive in the role with the Cardinals before being traded to the Mets this past season. In 22 appearances for the Mets, however, he pitched to a 7.20 ERA and 1.80 WHIP. It's entirely possible that was just a small, fluky stretch. In 2024, he had a 2.04 ERA and 1.10 WHIP with 79 strikeouts in 66 ⅓ innings, closing down an MLB-best 49 saves in 53 chances.Phillies expected to retain SchwarberThe \"feeling here is that [Kyle] Schwarber will remain in Philadelphia,\" said MLB.com earlier this week. The report indicates that the Phillies have \"prioritized\" keeping Schwarber and free agent catcher J.T. Realmuto, though nothing as of this writing is close to being done. \nThe 32-year-old DH hit .240/.365/.563 (150 OPS+) with 56 home runs, 132 RBI, 111 runs and 4.7 WAR in 162 games last season. He finished second in NL MVP voting behind Shohei Ohtani. Jays still looking for reliefThe Blue Jays landed free agent starting pitcher Dylan Cease earlier this week and remain in contact with All-Star free agent Bo Bichette. They're also in on relievers, according to SportsNet, looking for at least one late-inning pitcher. The report notes that the Jays were in on Phil Maton before the Cubs signed him and \"monitored\" Raisel Iglesias. \nAs things stand, the defending AL champs have Jeff Hoffman at closer with Yimi García, Louis Varland and Brayden Fisher setting up. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are one win away from the first MLS Cup appearance in their history, and at 38, the Argentine shows no signs of slowing down. The Herons will host New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final at Chase Stadium on Saturday as they look to secure a trophy to end their season on a strong note. Adjustments by Javier Mascherano have the team riding a shutout streak of more than 200 minutes, but during these playoffs, one thing has been made clear: Miami will go as far as Messi can take them. This is obviously no surprise. Even at his age, Messi was far and away the best player in MLS this season. He led the league in goals, with 29, five more than anybody else, assists with 19 (tied with Anders Dreyer), and shots with 157. Of those goals, 28 were non-penalty goals an MLS record. He did this all while only playing in only 28 games in a 34 game regular season schedule. Messi may be 38 years old, but he remains Lionel Messi, an unstoppable force the likes of which the world, let alone MLS, has never seen.And then the playoffs started, and things got even better. How to watch Inter Miami vs. New York City FC, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 6 p.m. ETLocation: Chase Stadium -- Fort Lauderdale, FloridaLive stream: MLS Season PassOdds: Inter Miami -210; Draw +360; NYCFC +490With 12 goal contributions during the playoffs, no player has more in MLS history, and Messi's six goals lead all members of the playoffs, and so do his six assists (including secondary assists). He's done this in just four games, but it's unheard of for one player to have been involved in every goal for their club during a playoff run. But that's just what Messi has done during his time in MLS. He has made the unheard of seem regular, and this run is no different.No team has ever won MLS Cup with one player contributing to all of their goals, so if Miami can accomplish that with Messi keeping up what he has been doing, they can make even more history during this postseason. Taylor Twellman, himself an MLS legend, contributed to every goal on the run New England Revolution made the final in 2007, but they fell to the Houston Dynamo in the MLS Cup. Also, that was a grand total of three team goals, Miami is already at 12.\nPlayers to be involved in every goal contributionMinimum four games playedSeasonPlayer TeamGoalsAssistsContributionsTeam Goals Games2025Lionel MessiInter Miami66121242018Daniel RoyerNew York Red Bulls224442007Taylor TwellmanNew England Revolution30334You can already see clear differences in how many goals Messi has been involved in compared to others on this list, and while the league MVP hasn't been announced yet, it'd be a surprise for anyone other than Messi to win the award, as he's arguably having the best season of anyone to ever come through MLS.Messi may not have a trophy to mark what he's done yet, but with Miami becoming the first MLS team to ever defeat a team from a European top-five league when they triumphed over Porto during the Club World Cup, this is a team showing what the possibilities are for MLS, and a large reason for that is Messi's impact so let's take a deeper look at some numbers that have defined the season so far.48: Goal Contributions during the MLS regular seasonWith 29 goals and 19 assists during the season, only one player has had more, and that's Carlos Vela in 2019. Vela had a whopping 49 goal contributions with 34 goals and 15 assists, being involved in more than a goal per game. Those two stand alone, and even with the league including secondary assists in their numbers, this is an astounding figure. It's worth nothing that excluding secondary assists Messi jumps ahead of Vela on the goal contribution front as 16 of Messi's 19 assists were primary assists while only 10 of Vela's 15 were. Then there's the question of penalties. Vela scored a whopping nine goals from the penalty spot, Messi scored one.\nNo one has been able to stop Messi when he's on the pitch, and even when he has to pick his spots to get forward, the Argentine's ability to float into space is unmatched. Having a player like this on the team also opens up opportunities for those around them, which should bring no surprise that Miami's 12 goal contributions during this playoff run are the most of any team.7: Consecutive matches with a goal or an assistTo have so many goal involvements, a player needs to be consistent, and of course, Messi has done just that. You ahve to go back to September 30, facing the Chicago Fire, to find he last time that Messi hasn't been involved in a goal. Since then, he has had 11 goals and 11 assists. Quite some balance, but in the 32 MLS matches that Messi has featured in this season, including the playoffs, he has only failed to register a goal contribution in five matches. Miami has also failed to win any of those matches, losing four and drawing one. So it's simple: if NYCFC stops Messi, they can win the match. Just statistics say that it'll be quite hard to do.0: Trophies this seasonWhile the Messi era has brought Miami a Supporters' Shield and Leagues Cup trophy, this is one number that the Herons are trying to change, and New York City FC will stand in their way of doing that. NYCFC is the only team remaining in the playoffs that have won the MLS Cup before, but that doesn't mean Miami won't have enough experience to get them through the match in front of their home fans. Looking to not only send Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets into retirement on a high note but also close out Chase Stadium with a trophy, all of the pressure will be on the Herons to get the job done. \nThat's part of why the playoffs have had a different intensity for them. Last season's first round exit to Atlanta United is firmly in the past, but this season also isn't a successful one without a trophy. Just having Messi in the side raises expectations for Inter Miami above what has ever been expected from any MLS side, and they can reach those but not winning MLS Cup will only bring more questions to the side.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After becoming the Cleveland Browns' first quarterback to win his first career start since 1995 last week, Shedeur Sanders will start Sunday's matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. And if he plays well in his first home start, Sanders could potentially hang onto the starting job for the rest of the season, ESPN reports.The Browns (3-8) are \"open to giving Sanders an extended look\" similar to the reps fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel received earlier this season, per ESPN. Sanders took first-team reps and will start despite Gabriel, who has six starts this season, clearing concussion protocol.Sanders threw for 209 yards and his first career touchdown against the Raiders to guide the Browns to their first win in over a month. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said Friday that Sanders has had a \"good work week.\" \"Very committed to working at it, doing a great job, communicating with coaches, with the players,\" Stefanski said. \"Good work week, but nothing different. I think any player though, once you get one game under your belt, you got the next one coming. I think it can only help.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 13 odds, predictions, expert picks: Can Bills bounce back vs. Steelers?

Sanders mentioned much of the same in the aftermath of his first start, saying \"wait until I get a full offseason\" with added opportunities.\"I always want to exceed expectations, and I always want to grow in each and every week, I would want to put a better product of myself, be a better version of myself for the team to be out there,\" Sanders said. Sanders opened the season buried on Cleveland's depth chart behind Joe Flacco and Gabriel before the quarterback room thinned out. Flacco was traded to the Cincinnati Bengals and Gabriel, a third-round pick out of Oregon, threw for 937 yards, seven touchdowns and two interceptions in eight games before being sidelined by his concussion. \nLast week was the first time all season Sanders took first-team snaps in practice and worked with the starters. Now he's got a chance to lead the Browns, 5.5-point home underdogs vs. San Francisco (via FanDuel), to a second straight victory.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Room on the College Football Playoff bubble shrunk to a premium on Saturday as well-positioned CFP hopefuls like No. 6 Oregon and No. 8 Oklahoma handled business in tense games that threatened to disrupt the national hierarchy. The day's results left teams like No. 12 Miami and No. 14 Vanderbilt gasping for life, despite convincing road wins over ranked opponents.The Ducks withstood a late push from rival Washington to win 26-14 and shore up their spot in the 12-team playoff by finishing the regular season 11-1 (8-1 Big Ten). The Huskies (8-4, 5-4) drew within 19-14 on a 13-yard touchdown connection between Demond Williams Jr. and Denzel Boston with 8:54 remaining.But it took Oregon just three plays to strike back with a definitive blow in the form of a 64-yard catch-and-run from Dante Moore to Malik Benson. At the same time, the Sooners were busy outlasting LSU 17-13 in an ugly game that required OU's offense to wake up late. Trailing 10-3 late in the third quarter, Deion Burks housed an underneath route from John Mateer to tie it. After a go-ahead LSU field goal in the fourth quarter, the Sooners surged ahead for good with a 58-yard connection between Mateer and a wide open Isaiah Sategna.\nThose outcomes took some wind from the sails of the Hurricanes and Commodores, both of which needed big wins and some help in order to feel better about their chances of at-large inclusion.Here is the full rundown of the day's winners and losers.Winner: Ohio State ends its Michigan miseryOhio State earned its first victory over arch rival Michigan since before the COVID-19 pandemic, as the No. 1 Buckeyes stifled the No. 15 Wolverines in a 27-9 drubbing to cap a perfect regular season. Perhaps even more satisfying for the Buckeyes is that the win ended Michigan's hopes of crashing the CFP party. The Wolverines threw the first couple of punches with a pair of early field goals. But the nation's No. 1 total defense and No. 1 scoring defense quickly began showing its teeth. Ohio State held Michigan to just 163 total yards, which was 125 below its previous season low. The Buckeyes' offense did its part, too. A soul-sucking 12-minute drive spanning the end of the third quarter and nearly half of the fourth only resulted in a field goal for Ohio State. But it effectively ended any hope Michigan had of extending its winning streak in the series to five.\nLoser: LSU squanders a spoiler opportunityLSU could have ruined Oklahoma's season and delighted all the teams below the Sooners in the CFP hierarchy. The Tigers could have provided their fans with a joyful distraction from the stressful monotony of Lane Kiffin watch. They could have ended a frustrating regular season in scintillating fashion.Instead, LSU squandered a teed up opportunity to shake up the national landscape by giving away a 17-13 win to the No. 8 Sooners. A distressing day of missed opportunities began just over three minutes in when quarterback Michael Van Buren passed up a clear opportunity to run for a touchdown on first-and-goal. Instead, he threw across his body into traffic and was intercepted. It was emblematic of the offensive ineptitude which plagued the Tigers all day. Their defense held OU's equally listless offense in check for most of the day until finally breaking late with a pair of dreadfully defended touchdown passes from OU's John Mateer. \nWinner: Miami keeps cruisingNo. 12 Miami closed the regular season with a fourth straight blowout win over ACC competition by thrashing No. 22 Pitt 38-7 on the road. The Hurricanes fell behind 7-3 early but dominated from there to finish at 10-2 (6-2 ACC) for a second consecutive season. The 'Canes left their chances of reaching the ACC title game up to chance by losing to both Louisville and SMU earlier in the season, but they are unequivocally looking like the league's best team as December arrives. \nA season that began with receivers Malachi Toney and CJ Daniels balling out in a win over Notre Dame ended with the duo shining once again. Toney tallied 13 grabs for 126 yards and a touchdown while Daniels put the finishing touches on Saturday's big win with this ridiculous grab in the final minute. But unless there's an unlikely shakeup in the rankings, it likely won't be enough to get Miami in the at-large picture.\nLoser: Tennessee hosts Vanderbilt's grand celebrationNeyland Stadium turned into a staging grounds for No. 14 Vanderbilt to celebrate its first-ever 10-win season, as the Commodores thrashed No. 19 Tennessee 45-24. Star quarterback Diego Pavia may have booked his trip to New York City for the Heisman Trophy ceremony as he recovered from two first-half interceptions to surgically dissect a listless Volunteers defense with 383 total yards. Despite their standing as a 10-2 SEC team, the Commodores face tough odds to reach the College Football Playoff. But even if they are deprived of a chance to play for the national championship, the Commodores will always relish the state championship they secured Saturday. The first-ever ranked meeting between the in-state rivals marked Vanderbilt's first win in the series since 2018 and capped the program's most successful regular season in a century. Tennessee fans have made a habit over the decades of turning Nashville orange during their November meeting. But by game's end in 2025, the 'Dores had turned an emptying Neyland Stadium black and gold.\nWinner: Ricardo Jones caps a big yearClemson safety Ricardo Jones capped a big regular season with two massive interceptions in Clemson's 28-14 win over rival South Carolina. The sophomore star's first pick came in the end zone late in the third quarter just as the Gamecocks were driving for a potential go-ahead touchdown. His second was a game-clinching pick-6 off a ricochet. The pair of picks brought Jones' season tally to an ACC-best six and highlighted a stingy second-half performance by the Tigers' defense. South Carolina reached Clemson territory four times in the second half but never scored.\nLoser: Colorado reaches a crossroadsThose waiting for Deion Sanders to throw in the towel on his Colorado tenure following a 3-9 season may want to watch his postgame press conference from Saturday's season-ending 24-14 loss at Kansas State. Sanders didn't sound like a coach ready to hang it up after an adversity-filled season.\"This fan base, this school, (athletic director) Rick (George), everybody deserves much better than this,\" Sanders said. \"They expected much better than this. I expected much better than this. We're going to give them much better than this, starting tomorrow.\"\nSanders said he's \"already evaluated\" the program and is planning changes.\"I see everything being different, even me,\" Sanders said.\nWinner: Big 12's best handle businessNo. 5 Texas Tech and No. 11 BYU are heading into next week's Big 12 Championship Game on strong footing after avoiding potential pitfalls. The Cougars fell behind visiting UCF 14-0 before rallying for a convincing 41-21 win behind a pristine performance from Bear Bachmeier. The freshman QB completed 13 passes in a row over the second and third quarters as BYU seized control.There was no drama whatsoever for the No. 5 Red Raiders, who dominated West Virginia from start to finish in a 49-0 win. While No. 13 Utah faces long shot odds of reaching the CFP as an at-large team, the Utes rounded out a strong final weekend for the Big 12's best teams by beating Kansas 31-21 on Friday. All in all, it was a strong weekend for the contending class of a conference that passed the ACC in the Power Four hierarchy this season.\nLoser: Kentucky looks stuck with StoopsIf Kentucky had beaten Louisville and recovered from a 2-5 start with victories in four of its past five games, then perhaps retaining veteran coach Mark Stoops would have been more palatable for a growing faction of UK fans seeking change. But after a 41-0 shellacking at the hands of the rival Cardinals, Kentucky is in a brutal situation. The Wildcats (5-7) were outscored 86-17 over their final two games and will miss a bowl for the second straight season. \nFire Stoops, right? Well, it's not that simple. The 13th-year coach would be owed his full $38 million buyout within 60 days, meaning Kentucky would have to pay one of the biggest buyout figures in college football history with no hopes of an offset from his potential future job. And if you're waiting for Stoops to walk away on his own accord or to negotiate his buyout down to a more manageable figure, you might be waiting a while.\"Zero means zero,\" Stoops said. \"Zero percent chance I will. I'm going to be here as far as I'm concerned. Now, I can't control what decisions that are made. But if you're asking me, I said zero. Zero means zero.\"\nLoser: Florida State denied bowl eligibilitySelling a controversial decision to retain coach Mike Norvell would have been easier for Florida State if it had capped the regular season with a win at rival Florida to secure bowl eligibility. Instead, the Seminoles were left to lick their many wounds following a listless 40-21 loss to the Gators. The outcome dropped FSU to 5-7, ensuring it will miss a bowl for the fourth time in six seasons under Norvell. Outside of the 2022 and 2023 seasons when Florida State went a sterling 23-4, Norvell is 15-30. The highs of 2023 were spectacularly high, but they are beginning to pale in comparison to the many lows a once-proud program has experienced under Norvell's direction. \nWinner: Terry Smith rests his case Penn State completed a late-season rally to reach bowl eligibility under interim coach Terry Smith by outlasting Rutgers 40-36. Exactly how the Nittany Lions' coaching search will finish remains a mystery, but Smith made a compelling case to win the full-time job. The 56-year old former Penn State receiver and longtime cornerbacks coach kept the Nittany Lions engaged after a 3-6 start that included five gut-wrenching losses by six points or less. Saturday's win over the Scarlet Knights was no defensive clinic, but it showcased the resolve Penn State found under Smith.\nLoser: Jeremiah McClellan's catch wiped offOregon receiver Jeremiah McClellan nearly made a sensational catch on the first play of the fourth quarter in the No. 6 Ducks' 26-14 win over Washington. McClellan cradled the football against his helmet as he went to the turf. It was ruled an incompletion on the field, and the call was upheld upon review. It wound up as a consequential ruling, as the Ducks were forced to punt. Washington scored on its subsequent drive to pull within 19-14 and inject some drama into the rivalry showdown. You be the judge: catch or no catch?\nWinner: Miami (Ohio) secures its spotMiami (Ohio) is headed to the MAC Championship Game for a third straight season after beating Ball State 45-24 to reach 7-5 (6-2 MAC). Thomas Gotkowski threw three touchdowns for the Redhawks, who own a tiebreaker over fellow 6-2 teams Ohio and Toledo. They will face Western Michigan, which secured the league's regular season title on Tuesday night with a 31-21 win over Eastern Michigan. The Broncos (8-4, 7-1) will be making their first conference title game appearance since 2016. But hoisting the trophy will require getting revenge on a Miami team that won the regular season meeting 26-17.\nWinner: Jacksonville State walks it offJacksonville State secured its spot in the Conference USA Championship Game by rallying from a 14-point deficit to beat Western Kentucky 37-34 on a 28-yard field goal from Garrison Rippa as time expired. WKU would have gone to the title game with a win, and the Hilltoppers seized control with three straight touchdown drives to begin the game. But the Gamecocks responded with a relentless rushing attack as quarterback Caden Creel and running back Cam Cook each surpassed 135 yards on the ground.Jax State will host Kennesaw State in the title game. It will be a matchup between first-year coaches Charles Kelly (Jacksonville State) and Jerry Mack (Kennesaw State).\n            ",

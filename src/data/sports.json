    "body": "\n        Turns out Penn State won't be swallowing the $49 million buyout once attached to James Franklin's contract. Instead, the school will pay just $9 million after negotiating a dramatic reduction as Franklin's talks with Virginia Tech intensified in recent weeks, sources tell CBS Sports. Franklin is expected to be announced as the Hokies' next head coach within hours.Franklin's original buyout -- the second-largest in college athletics history when Penn State fired him in mid-October -- was structured to be paid through 2031. His future earnings at Virginia Tech would have offset a significant portion of that total, but as discussions with the Hokies escalated, both sides agreed to settle on a smaller, negotiated sum, sources told CBS Sports. Details of his contract at Virginia Tech are not yet known.The $40 million in savings is a substantial development for Penn State, which is still searching for its next coach. The lack of an $8 million to $9 million line item in the annual budget for the next six years frees up money to be invested in a new coach, staff and revenue sharing for players.\nAthletics director Pat Kraft hinted in October that Penn State's next coaching contract will look different because of the changing landscape of NIL and revenue sharing. Backed by deep-pocketed boosters and now freed from a historic buyout, the university is positioned as well as anyone to adapt.  \n        \n            \n                Virginia Tech hires James Franklin: Hokies make splash tabbing ex-Penn State coach to fill vacancy\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"When all these contracts were signed, the use of the money going to rev share and all the other pieces that are involved (were not in place),\" Kraft said in October. \"You have to process the financials in such a different light. \"And so, quite honestly, when you get into a search and start to have those hard conversations: What do you envision this program? How do you envision the program looking? How do you envision winning a national championship? I mean, the facts are the facts. You've got to recruit at a high level. And now the transfer portal -- you have to be able to recruit in the transfer portal at a high level. So how do you use your resources in the right way, building a roster that can compete for a national championship?\"\nThe Franklin settlement lands amid a season of escalating buyouts and boardroom drama. LSU fired Brian Kelly on Oct. 26, and the two sides have been arguing over the terms of his contract, which stipulates that the school must pay him 90% of his remaining salary (roughly $54 million). LSU attempted to negotiate a smaller payment with a larger lump sum upfront, but Kelly declined and filed a lawsuit against LSU last week.Franklin was fired when the Nittany Lions fell to 0-3 in the Big Ten following a 22-21 home loss to Northwestern in Week 7. Penn State started the season at No. 2 in the AP Top 25 but fell out of the rankings during the three-game losing skid. The school lost back-to-back games as a 20-point favorite (UCLA, Northwestern), becoming the first team to do so since 1978.Franklin went 104-45 in 12 seasons, captured the 2016 Big Ten championship and led Penn State to its first College Football Playoff berth last December, ultimately reaching the semifinals in January. He posted six 10-win seasons but never solved the program's biggest hurdle: beating elite opponents. Franklin finished 4-21 against AP top 10 teams, was 0-10 on the road in those matchups. He also brings a 15-game losing streak against teams ranked No. 6 or better into his Virginia Tech tenure.  \nPenn State lost six straight games, including three under Franklin, before recording its first Big Ten victory last Saturday at Michigan State. The Nittany Lions (4-6, 1-6) host Nebraska (7-3, 4-3) on Saturday.Penn State targeted Nebraska's Matt Rhule, a former Penn State player, and Indiana's Curt Cignetti early in its coaching search, but both received pay raises and opted to remain at their respective schools.Meanwhile, Franklin inherits a cushy gig at Virginia Tech, which is set to invest an additional $229 million into its athletics department over the next four years after its Board of Visitors approved a budget increase in September shortly after the school fired coach Brent Pry.\n            ",

Meanwhile, the Raiders are simply trying to salvage a season marked by numerous setbacks.Las Vegas is coming off an embarrassing performance against the division rival Broncos on \"Thursday Night Football\" in Week 10, and has now lost three in a row. The Raiders' only win since the season opener came against the lowly Titans, and they're playing more for draft positioning than anything else at this point in the season.Dallas is fresh off the bye after losing two consecutive games for the first time this season before the break. The Cowboys made massive moves at the trade deadline to try to propel themselves back into the playoff picture, but it's going to take a Herculean effort down the stretch for that to happen. If it's going to become a reality, it has to start on Monday night. Which of these two teams will bounce back from their latest loss? Which will join the Week 11 NFL winners and losers? Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Raiders liveDate: Monday, Nov. 17 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Allegiant Stadium -- Las VegasTV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Cowboys -3.5, O/U 49.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Cowboys battle the Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\"When the Cowboys have the ballDallas is coming off its Week 10 bye, having put together two of its weakest offensive performances of the season against the Broncos and Cardinals prior to the break. The Cowboys had been rolling with one of the very best offenses in the NFL prior to those two contests, and they're pretty well positioned to get back on track here in Vegas. The Raiders are 24th in opponent success rate against both the run and the pass, according to TruMedia, which should allow the Cowboys to choose their own adventure as they look to attack this defense. The Cowboys also have their offensive line fully healthy now after experiencing a myriad of injury issues earlier in the year. Every lineman with the exception of right tackle Terence Steele (the weakest link in the chain) missed at least one game prior to the bye, with right guard Tyler Booker missing three and center Cooper Beebe missing six before returning for that loss to Arizona. Now at full strength, that group should be able to create similar push and provide similar protection to what it did early in the season before the injuries started piling up. \nDallas has some pretty strong passing game advantages, in particular. The Raiders overhauled their secondary this offseason, and not necessarily to their benefit. Vegas checks in 23rd in EPA allowed per dropback, via TruMedia, allowing opponents to consistently create chunk gains through the air. The Cowboys will line CeeDee Lamb up all over the field, but he's at his most effective in the slot, where the Raiders largely count on Jeremy Chinn and Darnay Holmes to do the coverage. They've each allowed passer ratings over 100 on their slot snaps, according to Pro Football Focus, which is obviously a recipe for disaster against Lamb. Things don't get much easier when it comes to covering George Pickens, who operates as a true \"X\" receiver and wins on all kinds of comebacks, out-breakers and especially deep balls down the field. There has arguably been no better deep receiver in the NFL this season, and Eric Stokes, Darien Porter, Kyu Blu Kelly and the safeties over the top will have their hands full when it comes to containing him on those plays. \nThe Raiders' best hope when it comes to shutting down the Dallas passing game is obviously through getting considerable pressure on Dak Prescott, who has absolutely cooked defenses when actually afforded time to throw this season. The Raiders have one of the best pressure players in the world in Maxx Crosby, but they're still below average in pressure rate, per Tru Media, generating a sack, hit or hurry on only 32.9% of opponent dropbacks. If it's not Crosby dominating the game, it's hard to see how they'll get to Prescott on a consistent basis.The Raiders have actually done some pretty good work against the run on occasion this year, and they've been especially good at limiting yards before contact (0.98 per attempt, via TruMedia). They've largely limited explosive runs as well. The Dallas run game is mostly about ripping off consistent clips of five yards or so per carry rather than creating big gains, though, and Javonte Williams will have to make sure fall forward at every opportunity to limit negatives and set up good down-and-distance situations.Bet Cowboys vs. Raiders at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.\nWhen the Raiders have the ballThe Raiders offense totally cratered last week against the Broncos, looking non-viable for almost the entire game as Geno Smith was under constant pressure and Ashton Jeanty had very little room to run. Smith limply completed 16 of 26 passes for 143 yards and an interception while taking six sacks and having to scramble three more times (on which he gained only seven yards), while Jeanty gained just over 3 yards per carry on his 19 rushing attempts. It was a gross, unacceptable performance.Luckily for Las Vegas, this Cowboys defense is very much not that Broncos defense. Dallas has been one of the worst units in the NFL all season, allowing opponents to run and/or pass almost at will. The Cowboys are 31st in success rate against the run and 28th against the pass, per TruMedia, allowing 4.8 yards per carry and an otherworldly 8.2 yards per pass attempt. Of course, the Dallas defense that will take the field on Monday night is also much different than the one that has been taking the field for much of the season. The Cowboys added Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson at the trade deadline, and will also get both Demarvion Overshown and rookie Shavon Revel back from injury for this game. \nThat said, though, even Jerry Jones himself admitted that the Cowboys were not one or two players away from fixing their defense. They need every one of those reinforcements just to become a below-average unit, let alone a quality one. And it's likely that even their collective presences will not fix everything that was so wrong so far this year.The Raiders need to make sure they do a much better job than they did a week ago of getting the ball to their best player, Brock Bowers. The star tight end somehow ended the game against Denver with only three targets, mere days after he had gone off for 12 catches for 127 yards and three touchdowns against the Jaguars. Dallas' numbers against tight ends are pretty good so far this season, but some of that is due to having played a relatively weak slate of opposing tight ends -- and Bowers at his best is really operating like more of a receiver anyway. The Raiders absolutely have to line him up everywhere until they get favorable looks, then pepper him with the ball. Especially after trading away Jakobi Meyers at the deadline, they really don't have much else when it comes to weapons in the passing game. Tre Tucker has great speed and can perhaps run by one of the Dallas corners in space, but behind him in the wide receiver room are Tyler Lockett (who was cut by the Titans), Jack Bech and Dont'e Thornton.\nThe Raiders are weakened up front after the loss of Jackson Powers-Johnson to injured reserve, which could prove particularly hampering in the run game against the new-look interior of Dallas' front, which now includes Williams, Kenny Clark and Osa Odighizuwa all together. The best path to rushing success is probably to try getting Jeanty on the perimeter, attacking Dallas' smaller edge defenders, who aren't as strong against the run as they are rushing the passer. If they can spring Jeanty to the outside, he can get up to the second level and try to make the Dallas defensive backs tackle in space. Cowboys vs. Raiders prediction, pick\nThe Raiders might be at home, but they just have too many matchup disadvantages defensively for me to think they're going to slow down the Dallas offense in the same way that the Cowboys' last two opponents did. The Dallas defense, meanwhile, may have gotten just enough reinforcements to not completely fall apart against an offense that doesn't have much going for it in the first place. Pick: Cowboys 30, Raiders 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The San Antonio Spurs announced star big man Victor Wembanyama will miss time with a left calf strain suffered in a loss to the Warriors on Friday night. Wembanyama sat out the Spurs' win over the Kings on Sunday night and is now expected to be out of action for at least a few weeks, per Shams Charania. A firm timetable for his return was not provided, but the San Antonio Express-News reports he will be re-evaluated in two or three weeks.   Wembanyama has gotten off to a phenomenal start to his third season in the league, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.1 steals per game on 50.2/34.5/85.7 shooting splits. Thanks to Wembanyama's emergence as one of the game's most dominant two-way figures, the Spurs have raced out to a 9-4 record and sit in fifth place in the Western Conference.If he were to miss three weeks of action, that would mean Wembanyama would be out for 10 games. For a player who became the early yet heavy favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year and put himself at least in the conversation for Most Valuable Player, a 10-game absence would leave him with little margin to fulfill the NBA's new 65-game requirement for major individual awards. \nWembanyama would only be able to miss seven additional games the remainder of the season to retain award eligibility. Given teams generally ease players back into action after calf strains -- limit the number of back-to-backs they play -- his awards candidacy could be in serious jeopardy. Thunder big man Chet Holmgren (+130) moved into being the new DPOY favorite at FanDuel, with Wembanyama (+400) sliding to second with the news of his injury. On the court, the Spurs will have to lean on De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and their talented backcourt in Wembanyama's absence. San Antonio's performance against Sacramento offered a glimpse into how they can still find success without Wembanyama, pushing the tempo and leaning on their offensive talent without their defensive anchor on the floor. Luke Kornet got the start at center against the Kings and veteran Kelly Olynyk moved into the backup role. The Spurs will have two more home games to figure out their plan without Wembanyama before a heavy road stretch with six of their next seven games away from San Antonio, including difficult matchups with Denver, Minnesota, Orlando and Cleveland. \nvs. Grizzliesvs. Hawksat Sunsat Blazersat Nuggetsat Timberwolvesvs. Grizzliesat Magic at CavaliersOnly 1.5 games separate the Spurs in fifth from the Suns in eighth in the West, and the next few weeks will be a serious early season challenge for Mitch Johnson's group in learning how to handle adversity without their star. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Starting pitching stands at the heart of the Red Sox's needs this offseason. And, a league source told CBS Sports, Boston plans on re-engaging with the Twins on a possible trade for All-Star Joe Ryan.With Ryan, the 29-year-old pitcher who the Red Sox tried to acquire at the trade deadline, they would have a certified No. 2 starter. The team relied heavily on Garrett Crochet last year, describing him as the stopper, and while it worked perhaps better than even they could have expected (2.59 ERA in 205 ⅓ innings), it's hard to rely on that again in 2026.\"Aces stop the losing streaks and they keep the winning streaks going,\" said Red Sox manager Alex Cora during the 2025 season. \"That's what he's doing.\"Put Ryan in the mix and the Sox add another arm who can spark runs and stop skids. A move like that would tell the rest of the league the Red Sox are still serious about winning.\nFor the first time since 2021, the 2025 roster actually made sense. Young players had real mileage on them and a little scar tissue. The veterans knew how to win. They added Alex Bregman, a guy who had never missed the postseason in his nine-year career. They traded for Crochet, the best lefty in their rotation since Chris Sale and David Price, even if the experience gap was obvious.And even after moving on from their linchpin in Rafael Devers and losing Roman Anthony's to a season-ending oblique injury in early September, the group carried them. No, they didn't win the division, but they did secure a postseason berth as the second wild card. Despite the quick playoff exit, the season was largely viewed as a success.Good starting pitching separates contenders in October. Great starting pitching wins the World Series. This year's World Series put the gap on full display, flashing what's ahead of the Red Sox for years to come. The Blue Jays were the best hitting team in baseball, period. The Dodgers weren't at their offensive peak, but their stars delivered when it mattered, pushing them to a second straight title and a third in six years.\nInside all of that was the real separator: starting pitching.\"What we've seen in the postseason is a disproportionate number of runs come via the home run,\" Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said at the GM meetings last week. \"That's because pitching is so good that it's really difficult to stack hit after hit and create a rally to push runs across the board. Additionally, the schedule of the postseason naturally allows a team to leverage its best starters and relievers night after night.\"Last August, the Red Sox front office believed they were close to landing Ryan, a move that the club was confident would change their postseason path. But the rumblings out of Minnesota told a different story. The Twins didn't think Boston came close to meeting their price. Initially, the Twins asked for Roman Anthony in the Ryan deal, which was a hard no for the Red Sox. Then they pivoted to prospects Franklin Arias and Payton Tolle and the Sox were ready to play ball.However, when the Twins countered again and asked for Jarren Duran or Wilyer Abreu, the Red Sox halted, not wanting to pull impact players off their big-league roster. In the end, a deal between the two sides fell apart.\nFast forward to now and the Twins are largely viewed as a club with no direction, marred by ownership dysfunction. Even with its August fire sale, Minnesota thought it would contend as early as 2027. Byron Buxton was initially adamant about seeing it through. Now, he's reportedly willing to waive his no-trade clause if it means he can join a contender.\"I think the Twins themselves do not know [if they will contend],\" one source familiar with the inner-workings of the organization told CBS Sports. \"I do not think ownership knows what it is doing there in terms of its budget. But they know their attendance and TV numbers were bad last year. I think they are more likely to trade Pablo Lopez because of the money he makes than Ryan. If they were to trade both, then I think Buxton would want out and no one would go to any games.\"Ryan comes with two more years of team control. He only made $3 million last year, a number that fits the Red Sox' penny-pinching approach over the last five or so seasons, and MLB Trade Rumors estimates his arbitration raise would still only hit $5.8 million for 2026. (López, on the other hand, is due more than $21 million next year.) Ryan's contract certainly wouldn't be an obstacle for the Red Sox.\nFurthermore, given the dysfunction and the likelihood that the Twins won't contend before 2027, the return they're looking for might not hinge on pulling big-league pieces from the Red Sox. The deal will look different.Lastly, given Ryan's second-half struggles last season (2.72 ERA in the first half against a 4.67 ERA after the break), a Crochet-Ryan pairing should not be seen as some far-fetched goal.\"As we continue to look for ways to improve the team, someone to pitch alongside Garrett is certainly one way to do that,\" Breslow said last week.\nThe Red Sox desperately need a middle-of-the-order bat, especially if they don't bring back Bregman. And there's no indication the club is prepared to stretch above its capabilities to keep him.Pete Alonso could be an immediate fix at first base with the oft-injured Triston Casas heading into 2026 with even more uncertainty. Maybe there's a trade to be made. If, somehow, the club is able to re-sign Bregman, then the Red Sox have something brewing.On the pitching side, Brayan Bello took a step forward, with Breslow saying he looked like a legitimate No. 2 starter. That's generous; Bello profiles more as a back-end arm at this stage. Tolle and Connelly Early are in the picture now, too, though one of them might have to be part of a deal to land someone like Ryan.\nSo could the Red Sox contend in 2026? Yes. But Ryan is the first step, not the solution.\n            ",

Chase will be out for the Bengals' upcoming home game against the Patriots this Sunday.In addition to not playing in Week 12, Chase will also forfeit his weekly paycheck of $448,333 along with a $58,823 per game active bonus. The total he'll be out: $507,156.Ramsey was ejected from Pittsburgh's 34-12 win over the Bengals after throwing a punch at Chase early in the fourth quarter. He said afterward that his actions were the byproduct of Chase spitting on him, an accusation that Chase denied. Referee Bill Vinovich said afterward that his crew did not see Chase spit on Ramsey. The NFL, however, clearly determined that Chase did in fact spit on the Steelers' free safety. \nChase's suspension is in line with what Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter received after he spit on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott back in Week 1. Carter, who spit on Prescott prior to the game starting, was ejected for the entirety of that game and was also fined $57,222, which for Carter was the equivalent of losing a game check. Chase's absence will be a significant blow for a Bengals team that has won just one game since losing quarterback Joe Burrow to injury back in Week 2. \nA Pro Bowl receiver each of the past four years, Chase led the NFL with 76 receptions through 11 weeks. He wasn't much of a factor in Cincinnati's latest loss, however, as he caught just 3 of 10 targets for 30 yards during the Bengals' loss to the Steelers. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Shedeur Sanders' house was burglarized on Sunday, the same day he received his first regular-season NFL action, multiple sources, including cleveland.com's Mary Kay Cabot, reported Monday.It's unclear if anything was stolen. No suspects have been identified.Sanders, 23, made his official NFL debut during the second half of the Browns' 23-16 loss to the Ravens after Cleveland's starting quarterback, Dillon Gabriel, went into concussion protocol during halftime. Sanders finished 4 for 16 for 47 yards with an interception and two sacks taken.The Browns, who led 16-10 when Sanders entered, managed just four first downs in the second half. It was not only Sanders' first NFL game, but his first time working with the first-team offense, coach Kevin Stefanski said after the game -- a difficult situation but not at all uncommon for a backup quarterback.\n\"I don't think I played good at all,\" Sanders said after his debut. \"I think it's a lot of things we need to look at during the week and go and just get comfortable even throwing routes with Jerry [Jeudy] and throwing routes with all those guys. I think that was my first ball to him all year. But other than that, I just think overall we just gotta go next week and understand so then we have a week to prepare stuff I like to do.\"Sanders is expected to get his first NFL start in Week 12 against the Raiders and will have to prepare while dealing with the break-in as well.Sanders is one of several notable athletes whose house has been broken into while the in the past year-plus. Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce's homes were burglarized during the 2024 season, as was Joe Burrow's. In February 2025, federal prosecutors charged seven men -- alleged members of a South American crime syndicate -- with conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property. All of those burglaries occurred when those players were out of town for games; Sanders and the Browns were home Sunday.\nThe break-ins have not been limited to the NFL. In late December, 2024, the house of Luka Dončić, then with the Mavericks, was burglarized, with about $30,000 worth of jewelry stolen. Timberwolves guard Mike Conley and Bucks forward Bobby Portis were also victims of similar crimes. The FBI warned sports leagues about crime organizations targeting athletes' homes shortly after the Dončić incident. The NFL and NBA issued memos to its players a month earlier.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Brian Kelly Era in Baton Rouge ended on October 26, and the LSU football coaching search underway after the Tigers parted ways with Kelly before the team's bye week. His final act as the LSU head coach saw his team embarrassed in a 49-25 home loss to Texas A&M on Saturday, thus ending Kelly's tenure after three-plus seasons and a 34-14 (.708 record). While Kelly racked up plenty of victories with the Tigers, he failed to win the SEC in any year, and LSU's 13 losses as a ranked team under his spell are the most of any team in the nation since he took over in 2022. Frank Wilson is serving as the interim, and LSU fell 20-9 at Alabama in his debut in Week 11, but bounced back to beat Arkansas 23-22 in Week 12.The prior three LSU football coaches -- Ed Orgeron, Les Miles and Nick Saban -- all won national titles within their first four years at the school, which only magnified the lack of meaningful success for Kelly.

    "body": "\n        The Ole Miss Rebels are 10-1, have secured a third consecutive double-digit-win season -- a first in program history -- and are on the cusp of their first College Football Playoff berth as well.But after a win over Florida and with an open date upcoming this weekend, all eyes and ears and rumors surrounding the Rebels are focused on what coach Lane Kiffin's next move will be ... if there is one.Florida, which Kiffin's team beat 34-24 thanks to a second-half rally, and LSU are hot on the trail trying to whisk the 50-year-old coach away from Oxford, Mississippi, and the Tigers upped the ante Monday, sending a private plane to Oxford to pick up members of the Kiffin family and give them a tour of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, per Wilson Alexander of The Advocate.In addition to the Baton Rouge trip, a Kiffin family member visited Gainesville, Florida, on Sunday as the Gators ramp up their pursuit of the Rebels coach, sources confirmed to CBS Sports' John Talty and Richard Johnson. \nAs CBS Sports reported Monday morning, there's been a recent shift regarding the prospects of Kiffin staying with the Rebels.A few weeks ago those around Oxford were confident Kiffin would return. Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which represents Kiffin, was engaging the Rebels in extension talks. The College Football Playoff not beginning until Dec. 19 seemed to work in the program's favor (the Rebels are almost assuredly in). The tenor has shifted in recent weeks. There's considerably less confidence now that Kiffin will stay in Oxford as several sources CBS Sports talked to believe it is more likely he'll leave. Meanwhile, others in the last 24 hours have expressed optimism he'll stay. Frankly, Kiffin is someone whose mind can change from day to day.There are questions in his camp about the political infrastructure in Baton Rouge. There are also concerns for Kiffin about his potential alignment with the Florida administration. \n        \n            \n                Latest coaching intel: Lane Kiffin's decision a true soap opera, James Franklin closing in on new job?\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLSU, ranked ninth in the preseason AP Poll, is a disappointing 6-4 (3-4 SEC) and fired Brian Kelly last month. Florida, ranked 15th in the preseason AP Poll, has cratered to 3-7 (2-5 SEC) and fired Billy Napier last month, one week before LSU fired Kelly.\nKiffin owns a 115-53 (.685) career record, including a 54-19 (.740) mark at Ole Miss. The Rebels are averaging 494 yards per game this season, third in FBS, and are nearly assured of a spot in the Playoff. After a bye week this weekend, they face Mississippi State in their annual Egg Bowl rivalry meeting Nov. 28.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Early in the 2025 season, Virginia Tech athletic director Whit Babcock went before the university board and made a plea: The Hokies needed to make significant investments in the football program to get out of the ACC cellar. Despite strong fan support and tradition, Virginia Tech ranked near the bottom of the conference in funding. As a result, they have five losing seasons in six years and have quickly atrophied since legendary coach Frank Beamer retired. Fundamentally, Virginia Tech needed a figure who could walk in and drag the program into the modern era of college football. In hiring James Franklin, Virginia Tech has exceeded all expectations. Franklin is not only the top candidate on the coaching market but one of the best coaches in history to enter free agency. Last year, Franklin ranked No. 7 in CBS Sports' ranking of the best coaches in the sport. He is a future Hall of Fame program builder, posting a 128-60 career record and leading Penn State to the national semifinals just one year ago. \nIn the wake of his firing at Penn State, focus shifted to Franklin's failings at the elite levels of college football. His 2-21 record against AP top six opponents marks the second-worst record of any coach with at least 20 such games (ironically behind Virginia Tech legend Frank Beamer). Virginia Tech smartly looked past it. \n        \n            \n                Virginia Tech hires James Franklin: Hokies make splash tabbing ex-Penn State coach to fill vacancy\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhy James Franklin is home-run hire for Virginia TechLet's, for a moment, talk about Franklin's success. In his first job at Vanderbilt, he led the Commodores to 18 wins in two seasons. Clark Lea is rightly getting his flowers, but he could only even match that mark by winning out. Then, Franklin went to Penn State and won the program's first outright Big Ten title in more than 20 years. The Nittany Lions posted six 10-win seasons and five AP top 10 finishes in 12 years. The number of programs that could match that achievement can be counted on two hands. \nGranted, the final year of the Franklin era was a massive disappointment. Penn State invested heavily in its 2025 roster, and the program stunningly limped out to a 3-3 start -- headlined by a loss to Northwestern -- before Franklin was fired. The season was a train wreck, and Franklin had to answer for it. But at Virginia Tech, these are champagne problems. What's not in question is that Franklin is one of the great program builders of the 21st century. And at Virginia Tech, he should immediately change everything. Franklin had serious leverage heading into the coaching market, especially as numerous Power Four jobs started to open. Nine Power Four programs have already fired head coaches. However, Virginia Tech emerged as a natural fit because of his skillset and ties to the Northeast. And, without question, he was able to get important concessions from the university in exchange for taking the job. There's zero chance he would take the Virginia Tech opening if they were to continue as a small-money program. \nFor years, Franklin was an assistant coach at Maryland, and even was at one point named Maryland's head coach-in-waiting. He also recruited Pennsylvania, Virginia and New Jersey heavily, becoming one of the most successful coaches in the region. At a time where the SEC and other major powers have started raiding Virginia, Franklin should be able to fight back at Virginia Tech. But, more importantly, Franklin is a ruthless CEO. He helped maximize Penn State's potential in recruiting and fan support. Franklin also has a strong track record of hiring assistant coaches (ironically, including the man he's replacing, Brent Pry). He will immediately become the most powerful figure in the athletic department and win over the Southern Virginia community. Virginia Tech is a passionate fanbase and athletic department with a history of winning at the highest level. James Franklin is the perfect man to bring them back. \n            ",

The speculation from Jon Morosi is that the Red Sox either \"bring back Bregman or they make an all-out pursuit for Pete Alonso.\" Bregman, 31, hit .273/.360/.462 (128 OPS+) with 28 doubles, 18 homers, 62 RBI, 64 runs and 3.5 WAR in 114 games last season for the Red Sox. He then opted out of his three-year deal with the club to become a free agent for the second straight offseason.Alonso, 30, hit .272/.347/.524 (144 OPS+) with 41 doubles, 38 homers, 126 RBI, 87 runs and 3.4 WAR in 162 games in 2025. Though he's almost exclusively played first base in his Mets career, agent Scott Boras has said he's open to some time spent as DH. \nThe Red Sox currently have Triston Casas, returning from injury, as their first baseman and, if Bregman doesn't come back, youngster Marcelo Mayer likely at third.They only have an estimated payroll of $127.1 million on the books right now, so they could easily absorb either Bregman or Alonso in free agency. Frankly, they could sign both and still be fine.\nYankees re-sign YarbroughThe Yankees are bringing back lefty Ryan Yarbrough on a one-year deal, per The Athletic. The deal is worth $2.5 million with performance bonuses, according to ESPN. In 19 appearances last season for the Yankees, Yarbrough was 3-1 with a 4.36 ERA, 1.20 WHIP and 55 strikeouts in 64 innings. He's likely to resume his role as a long reliever/spot starter.\n            ",

Nine Power Four jobs opened before November, and now eight are availabe after Virginia Tech hired former Penn State coach James Franklin on Nov. 17. A record-setting year is already underway. Only five power jobs came open all of last season, when 30 total jobs (25 in the Group of Six) were filled.  Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span. That number will skyrocket this fall and winter.  \nCBS Sports is tracking every move in the 2025-26 cycle and grading each hire below.

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs roll into their second week with the divisional round NFL schedule on Saturday and Sunday. Underdogs went 4-2 against the spread on Wild Card Weekend, which could certainly affect where you lean with your divisional round NFL picks. The No. 1 seeds take the field on Saturday with Broncos vs. Bills (+1.5, 45.5) at 4:30 p.m. ET, followed by Seahawks vs. 49ers (+7, 44.5) at 8 p.m. ET. Buffalo defeated Denver in the postseason last year, while San Fran and Seattle split their two matchups this season.Sunday divisional round NFL bets would then center on Patriots vs. Texans at 3 p.m. ET and Rams vs. Bears at 6:30 p.m. ET. The Pats (-3, 40.5) are on a 1-6 run versus the line when they have a rest advantage, which could make them ones to fade with Houston coming off a Monday victory. Meanwhile, L.A. is the only Wild Card team that lost against the spread but won its game outright, as the Rams are 4.5-point road favorites (O/U 48.5) in the latest divisional round NFL odds.

The Seahawks have a top running back tandem in Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet, along with Jaxon-Smith Njigba at receiver, who led the NFL with 1,793 receiving yards this season. Meanwhile, the 49ers' Brock Purdy has played like one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL in recent weeks, despite seemingly a new injury popping up in the offense weekly. But having Christian McCaffrey healthy in the backfield certainly helps create opportunities. Seven of the last eight 49ers' games hit the Over, and the Over is 12-5 in Seahawks contests this season.

    "body": "\n        There is some doubt about the status of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold for Saturday's divisional round playoff matchup with the San Francisco 49ers. Darnold has been labeled as questionable after suffering an oblique injury while throwing during Thursday's practice, and ESPN reported Saturday morning that he hasn't thrown a football since. He will do so for the first time in warmups before the game to see if he can play.\"The Seahawks believe, but don't know, that he will be OK to start,\" per ESPN. Darnold said he felt some discomfort in his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks by continuing to throw during practice. \"Didn't wanna push it,\" he said Thursday. \"Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.\"Darnold said that there is a \"very low percentage\" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game. \"Probably closer to zero,\" he said with a slight smile. \n\n        \n            \n                Seahawks vs. 49ers prediction: Can San Francisco overcome injuries, short week at No. 1 seed Seattle?\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDarnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Minnesota Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason. Darnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes. \nIf Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn to Drew Lock, who received reps with Seattle's first-team offense on Thursday and Friday. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Denver Broncos. \"Drew's been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,\" Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said following Thursday's practice. \"Started a lot of football games, 28 games in the league. Lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.\" \nWhile Lock will have to be ready, Darnold has made it clear that he fully expects to be on the field to make his second career postseason start. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Despite reports involving Matt LaFleur's uncertain future following the Green Bay Packers' 31-27 wild-card loss to the Chicago Bears in the NFL playoffs, the Packers are working to bring back both LaFleur and general manager Brian Gutekunst on contract extensions, ESPN reports. Both are headed into the final year of their respective contracts. Conversations between the Packers, LaFleur and Gutekunst will continue through the weekend, with ESPN reporting Saturday the expectation in Green Bay is that extensions for both will get done and the Packers would be \"surprised\" if both aren't back in 2026 with new long-term deals. LaFleur is 76-40-1 in Green Bay with six postseason appearances in seven years -- with a 3-6 overall record in the playoffs. \"Next season is the last on LaFleur's contract, and new Packers CEO Ed Policy has said he doesn't wish for someone to coach in a lame duck year. So the Packers will seemingly either extend LaFleur or part ways with him, via a firing or a trade. In theory, time is ticking on Green Bay's decision,\" CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones wrote over Wild Card Weekend.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL head coach matchmaker: Kliff Kingsbury to Ravens, Brian Flores to Steelers and other top pairings\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLaFleur said after the loss in Chicago that he wanted to remain with the Packers. Green Bay lost an 18-point lead in the second half despite four touchdown passes from franchise quarterback Jordan Love.\"Of course [I want to return]. This is one of one,\" LaFleur said. \"I love this place. I love the people. As much as you guys drive me nuts sometimes, I love you guys. I love our players, the locker room, everybody in our organization. I mean, this is a unique place. The community has been outstanding. I grew up in the Midwest and it's got the same type of vibe that I grew up [with] in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. \"So, people are just -- unless you're from here, you don't understand, I think, how friendly everybody is. And it's nice no matter who you are, you're walking down the street, and people say hello to one another. I've lived other places, so I think this is a unique place, this is a special place. My kids love it here, my family loves it here.\"\nLove gave LaFleur his seal of approval after the Packers' ill-fated fourth quarter against the Bears, who scored 25 points in the final frame to win.\"Yeah, I definitely think Matt should be the head coach. I've got a lot of love for Matt. I think he does a great job. And that's it,\" Love said.Green Bay lost five straight to end the regular season and limped into the playoffs from the NFC North. The belief was LaFleur, who's entering the final year of his contract in 2026, would meet with Policy sometime this week to discuss his future. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A windy day in Honolulu saw Waialae Country Club show some teeth in Friday's second round of the Sony Open, with tougher scoring conditions condensing the top of the leaderboard and sending some big names home early. After yielding a pair of 62s on Thursday, the best anyone could do on Friday was a 64, with Davis Riley firing a 6-under second round to surge into a share of the lead and Ryan Gerard matched him for low round of the day to climb into the top 10. Riley credited a hot putter and an improved ball-striking day for moving him into a tie on top of the leaderboard, even with a penalty stroke in his round. \"Today I putted really well, but I definitely hit the ball a little bit better today,\" Riley said. \"It maybe wasn't even better, I just didn't have as many crazy shots as yesterday. I had a penalty stroke off the tee yesterday, which really cost me and felt like I lost a lot of momentum there. Overall the ball striking was a little cleaner and continued some of that good putting.\" On the other end of the spectrum was Collin Morikawa, as the No. 17 player in the Official World Golf Rankings could only manage a 68 on Friday to finish at even par for the week, one shot short of the cut line. As so often happens with Morikawa, it was the putter that let him down. Morikawa missed a few short putts on his back nine, including a 6-footer for birdie on No. 18 to make the cut. \nA missed cut in the season opener that doesn't feature many of the game's elite is an extremely difficult way for Morikawa to begin what he hopes is a bounce-back season after a tough second half of 2025. He still appears to be searching for the form that made him a two-time major champion and won't get the kind of confidence boost expected from a Sony Open start. Morikawa wasn't alone in struggling with the wind on Friday, and will find some company from a few other notable names who will also be looking for an early flight home -- most notably Keegan Bradley, who also finished his week at even par. Jordan Spieth did make the cut, as he aims for a rebound season himself, and he highlighted the challenge of the conditions on Friday after his round, a second consecutive 68 that moves him comfortably into the weekend at 4 under. \n\"I hit a 7-iron into that 15th hole. I had maybe 158 hole and I think it went 120 yards and I played it like 175,\" Spieth explained. \"So it was just very challenging at times. And on the greens it just becomes really hard to make putts when it's that windy.\"Thanks to those conditions, things bunched up considerably and when the third round gets underway, plenty of players will believe they're still in contention to win the opening event of the 2026 PGA Tour season. LeadersT1. Nick Taylor, Davis Riley, S.H. Kim, Adrien Dumont de Chassart, Kevin Roy (-9)\nWhile Taylor and Roy couldn't replicate their 62s from Thursday, the first round co-leaders remain in a share of the lead heading into the weekend -- with Taylor aiming to go back-to-back in Honolulu. Riley's low round of the day vaults him into first as well, with Kim (68), Parry (67) and Dumont de Chassart (67) climbing to the top of the leaderboard as well. Those five players will tee it up late in the afternoon for Saturday's third round, and they'll hope that it's similar to Friday when the winds got going in the morning and made it tough on the early wave. Taylor is the favorite of this group to maintain his spot given his ranking and history of success at Waialae.ContendersT5. Maverick McNealy, Chris Gotterup, John Parry, Takumi Kanaya (-8)T10. Ryan Gerard, Vince Whaley, Patrick Rodgers (-7)T13. Ben Griffin, Jake Knapp and six others (-6)\nThere are some extremely notable names in the chase pack entering the weekend, and given we know there are low scores that can be produced at Waialae when the conditions present themselves, everyone in this group -- and even some behind -- will feel like they're very much in the hunt for a win. McNealy, Gotterup and Griffin pick up where they left off in 2025, as all three enjoyed career years on Tour and are off to a quality start to their 2026 campaign. Griffin stumbled on Friday to a 71, falling a bit off the pace after a hot first round, but he'll be a serious threat on the weekend right alongside McNealy and Gotterup. Ryan Gerard is a popular pick as a breakout star for the 2026 season, as he also closed 2025 strong, and he's making those projections look smart with his start in Hawaii. \nNotable players who missed the cutCollin Morikawa (E)Keegan Bradley (E)Luke Clanton (+1)Chris Kirk (+1)Cam Davis (+3)Gary Woodland (+3)Tony Finau (+6)2026 Sony Open updated picks, oddsOdds via FanDuel SportsbookNick Taylor (11/2)Maverick McNealy (17/2)Chris Gotterup (11-1)Takumi Kanaya (13-1)Adrien Dumont de Chassart (13-1)S.H.

Gotterup at 11-1 also seems solid, especially if winds stay up as he's proven in the past to be able to handle those conditions -- albeit on a very different kind of course in Scotland. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The hot stove has finally begun to heat up. Within the last week Bo Bichette (Mets), Alex Bregman (Cubs), Ranger Suárez (Red Sox), Kyle Tucker (Dodgers), and others signed. Nolan Arenado (Diamondbacks) was finally traded as well. There are still more than a few top free agents available, however. Here now are Saturday's hot stove rumors.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Orioles interested in Verlander  \nThe Orioles are among the teams with interest in future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander, reports The Athletic. Verlander and O's president of baseball operations Mike Elias overlapped for several years with the Astros. It's possible Baltimore considers Verlander a fallback plan in case it doesn't land a higher upside arm. We ranked Verlander the 26th best free agent available this offseason.  Verlander, 43 next month, finished last season strong with the Giants, pitching to a 2.60 ERA with strong underlying numbers (3.36 FIP) in his final 13 starts. The O's added Shane Baz and re-signed Zach Eflin earlier this offseason, though there's still room in the rotation for one more quality arm. While no longer the ace he was in his prime, Verlander remains effective.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Reds made De La Cruz record offer\nLast spring, the Reds offered star shortstop Elly De La Cruz the largest contract in franchise history, GM Nick Krall told MLB.com. \"We engaged in spring training of 2025 and presented an offer. The  offer would have been the largest contract in Reds history. We didn't  have any further conversations regarding the offer,\" Krall said. De La Cruz is a Scott Boras client.The largest contract in Reds history is the 10-year, $225 million extension Joey Votto signed in April 2012. The offer to De La Cruz would have easily been the largest contract for a player with between one and two years of service time, eclipsing Jackson Merrill's nine-year, $135 million deal with the Padres. De La Cruz, 24, can not become a free agent until after the 2029 season.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     D-backs want to add bullpen arm  The Diamondbacks would like to add a proven late-inning arm, GM Mike Hazen told the Arizona Republic. He acknowledged it will not be easy this late in the offseason though. \"Would I like to have somebody that has a clear pedigree of pitching in  the eighth and ninth inning? That's an easier answer. I'm not sure what  we'll have access to in that way,\" Hazen said.  Arizona's bullpen ranked 27th in ERA and 28th in WAR in 2025, and its only notable relief adds this offseason are righties Taylor Clarke and Jonathan Loáisiga. Loáisiga is coming off a flexor strain and may not be ready for Opening Day. As it stands, manager Torey Lovullo's late-inning group includes lefty Andrew Saalfrank and righties Kevin Ginkel and Ryan Thompson.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cardinals, Mets interested in Canning  \nCount the Cardinals and Mets among the teams with interest in free agent righty Griffin Canning, according to the New York Post. Canning made 16 mostly effective starts with the Mets last year before blowing out his Achilles taking an awkward step off the mound. He is expected to be ready around Opening Day, or shortly thereafter. Canning was not among our top 50 free agents.  \nSt. Louis is in the early stages of a rebuild and is simply looking to add innings, preferably with upside that could potentially be flipped for prospects at the deadline. Canning qualifies. The Mets need a top flight starter more than another back-end innings guy, though options are limited at this point. Besides, they know Canning well and there's no such thing as too much pitching.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        At some point, it appears that John Harbaugh is going to become the next head coach of the New York Giants, but that hasn't quite happened yet. After visiting with the team on Wednesday, reports came out later that night that he had decided to take the job in New York.Giants fans celebrated the hire, but the celebration has suddenly turned into concern, because two days later, there's still no deal in place. The team had all day Thursday to finalize a contract with Harbaugh, but a deal didn't get done, and as of Friday even, there was still no contract in place. This probably isn't a big deal, but this is the part where we're going to point out there have been at least two occasions since 2000 where a coach verbally accepted a job, only to change his mind at the last second. The most famous instance came in January 2000 when Bill Belichick accepted a job to become head coach of the Jets, but then he decided to not to show up for the press conference. And the best part might be the fact that he turned in his resignation on a napkin. \n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt's not just Belichick, though. Less than 10 years ago, there was a similar situation with Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. On Feb. 6, 2018, the Colts announced that they were going to hire McDaniels as their new head coach, but he never took the job, because later that night, McDaniels had a change of heart and decided to stay in New England. \nIt was a shocking turn of events that proved one big thing: No deal is done until the contract is signed, and right now, Harbaugh's contract isn't signed. As of Friday night, Harbaugh's contract is still up in the air. According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media, the thing that seems to be holding up the negotiation process is that the two sides can't agree on a \"reporting structure.\"\"It does not sound like this is about money, it sounds like it's more about reporting structure and who is able to do what and how the whole organization is set up, which generally, are things you discuss during the lead up, during the interview, during the courting process,\" Rapoport said. \"It certainly seems like there was something lost in translation either from the John Harbaugh side or from the Giants side, I guess. There's a lot to be handled. It sounds like they're trying to handle it, but smooth sailing it has not been.\"\nIt could be something as simple as who has final say on roster issues between Harbaugh and general manager Joe Schoen. According to Pat Leonard of the New York Daily News, Schoen's role in the organization may in fact be one of the hangups in the negotiation. According to Tom Pelissero of NFL Media, a deal could come soon, but there's also a small chance that it might not come at all. \"Harbaugh has been very methodical about doing his due diligence on all the interested teams,\" Pelissero said Friday. \"This is leaning toward John Harbaugh becoming the next Giants' head coach, but it was not and is not a foregone conclusion.\"\nThat being said, Giants fans probably don't need to panic just yet. For one, the Giants somewhat acknowledged the fact that Harbaugh will likely be their next coach with a simple tweet on Thursday. \nCBS Sports senior NFL reporter Matt Zenitz reported on Friday morning that the two sides \"are still in the process of trying to finalize a deal,\" but that \"the full expectation remains that this will get done and that he'll be hired as the Giants' next head coach.\"Giants beat writer Art Stapleton also reported on Friday that it was just a matter of time before a deal got done, \"This isn't about John Harbaugh still making demands,\" Stapleton wrote. \"He's the head coach of the Giants, spirit of the law. Letter of the law, they've got to go through the contract and make sure language works for lawyers on both sides. Again, the deal is agreed upon. It's legal language now.\"\nSince Harbaugh hasn't signed a deal with the Giants yet, other teams are free to contact the former Ravens coach, and it's certainly possible that's happening, but he might not be listening. Harbaugh was scheduled to interview with the Titans on Thursday, but he called that off and the presumption was that he called it off because he was going to take the Giants' job. According to Rapoport, the Titans are watching the situation in New York very closely. Kevin Stefanski is also watching because he appears to be Plan B for the Giants if things somehow fall through with Harbaugh. \"You have Kevin Stefanski, who may be the one if it does not work out with John Harbaugh, he is also waiting,\" Rapoport said. \"The entire coaching cycle is waiting for this deal to get done.\"\nAt this point, it seems like the two sides just need some time to iron out the final details of the contract, but no one in New York should be celebrating Harbaugh's hiring until there's a signed contract in place, and right now, there's no signed contract in place. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The phrase \"opposites attract\" has commonly been used in reference to the dating world, but it also applies to NFL head-coaching searches. Over the years, NFL teams have shown a track record of targeting head-coaching candidates with backgrounds opposite those of the coaches they fired. In the spirit of that idea, CBSSports.com explores what that candidate would look like in each coaching search.The trend in recent years has been hiring young offensive minds who may have shared a cup of coffee with Sean McVay or Kyle Shanahan, so teams may overcorrect this offseason.The New York Giants are finalizing a deal with former Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, which is a unique case. Aside from a year as defensive backs coach with the Eagles, Harbaugh's entire NFL coaching résumé came on special teams, a phase of the game often underrepresented in head-coaching searches. The Giants fired Brian Daboll, a former offensive coach and first-year head coach, to hire a veteran head coach with some defensive experience, so the \"opposites attract\" theory is already being affirmed in this coaching cycle.Here is what that would look like for each of the other eight coaching vacancies:\nNote: These are not coaching predictions but rather an experiment. For real-time developments, CBSSports.com has live updates, along with a tracker of head coach and general manager interviews.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jonathan Gannon ➡︎ Arthur SmithPrevious position (Smith): Steelers offensive coordinatorWhen Arizona last conducted a head-coaching search, it hired a first-year coach with a defensive background. Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and Smith are two candidates who fit the criteria of the experiment, and both have interviewed.Smith previously served as the Falcons' head coach and garners significant respect across the league. Nagy's tenure in Chicago ended unceremoniously, but he is getting a second chance to interview with teams.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Raheem Morris ➡︎ Klint KubiakCurrent position (Kubiak): Seahawks offensive coordinatorThe Falcons fired Raheem Morris, who not only had previous head-coaching experience but also served as the organization's interim coach in 2020. He had also been Tampa Bay's head coach from 2009-11. Morris spent 24 consecutive seasons in the NFL, with the exception of one year as Kansas State's defensive coordinator.A first-year offensive head coach would be the opposite of the coach Atlanta fired. Kubiak is the only candidate linked to the Falcons who fits that description. The son of Gary Kubiak has been an offensive coordinator with the Vikings, Saints and now the Seahawks. He has orchestrated an offense that enabled Jaxon Smith-Njigba to lead the league in receiving, with veteran Sam Darnold serving as the facilitator.The Steelers have reportedly requested to interview Kubiak's brother, Klay, who is currently the 49ers' offensive coordinator.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    John Harbaugh ➡︎ Kevin StefanskiPrevious position (Stefanski): Browns head coachBaltimore has not made a head-coaching hire in two decades, making this projection more difficult. John Harbaugh was new and exciting when he was hired in 2008, but the franchise may be seeking a fresh start after a situation that had grown stale.In the spirit of the exercise, the parameters indicate Baltimore would be looking for a retread offensive mind. The Ravens have interviewed four candidates who fit that criteria: former Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel, Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and Stefanski. Stefanski served six years as Browns' head coach and has strong familiarity with the division.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kevin Stefanski ➡︎ Jim SchwartzPrevious position (Schwartz): Browns defensive coordinatorThere have been rumors about ownership's desire to keep Schwartz in some capacity, whether by promoting him to head coach or by hiring a young offensive coach open to defensive input while building his first staff. \nReports indicate Schwartz will receive a second interview with the Browns, which suggests he has a legitimate opportunity to replace Stefanski, who was a first-year offensive head coach when Cleveland hired him.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pete Carroll ➡︎ Mike LaFleurCurrent position (LaFleur): Rams offensive coordinatorThe Pete Carroll era lasted one season in Las Vegas. Carroll, a former defensive coordinator for the Jets and 49ers, logged 28 years of head-coaching experience with the Jets, Seahawks, Raiders and USC.Las Vegas has been linked to 10 candidates, including Broncos quarterbacks coach Davis Webb, Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase and LaFleur. LaFleur is the younger brother of Packers head coach Matt LaFleur. He is in his third year as offensive coordinator under Sean McVay and previously held the same role with the Jets.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike McDaniel ➡︎ Robert SalehCurrent position (Saleh): 49ers defensive coordinatorMiami gambled on an offensive-minded coach associated with Shanahan and decided to move on after four seasons.The only candidate who has interviewed and meets the criteria -- a veteran head coach with a defensive background -- is Saleh. Ironically, Saleh and Mike McDaniel previously served together on Shanahan's staff. The former Jets head coach has drawn praise for his work with a revamped 49ers defense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike Tomlin ➡︎ Brian FloresCurrent position (Flores): Vikings defensive coordinatorPittsburgh and head coach Mike Tomlin parted ways after 19 seasons. The Steelers should be looking for an experienced head coach with an offensive background. However, the only candidate with prior NFL head-coaching experience is Flores, who served as the Dolphins' head coach from 2019-21 and more recently worked as the Steelers' senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach in 2022.\nThe Steelers have had three head coaches in nearly six decades. Each had a defensive background, so it stands to reason the franchise may again seek a defensive coach who will bring a physical style consistent with its established culture.\n        \n            \n                NFL head coach matchmaker: Kliff Kingsbury to Ravens, Brian Flores to Steelers and other top pairings\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brian Callahan ➡︎ Vance JosephCurrent position (Joseph): Broncos defensive coordinatorBuzz out of Nashville suggests the Titans are looking for an offensive-minded head coach to work with last year's No. 1 overall pick, Cam Ward. Tennessee recently fired first-year offensive-minded head coach Brian Callahan, so a veteran head coach on the other side of the ball would fit the criteria.The organization has interviewed five coaches who meet that description: Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, former Falcons head coach Raheem Morris, 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh and former Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon. Joseph served as Denver's head coach from 2017-18.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The No. 10 Miami Hurricanes started the year ranked No. 10 in the preseason poll, so the idea that the Hurricanes finished the year in the College Football Playoff should not be surprising. Mario Cristobal entered 2025 coming off a 10-win season with one of the best offensive lines in football, so Miami essentially fulfilled expectations as one of the last teams in the field for the 12-team College Football Playoff bracket. But everything that has happened since Selection Sunday absolutely qualifies as Miami exceeding expectations, now one win away from winning the national championship for the first time since the legendary 2001 team. The Hurricanes went on the road as an underdog and beat Texas A&M. They followed that up by taking down Ohio State, the betting favorite to win it all, in the Cotton Bowl and then backed it up by winning an all-time thriller against Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl. Suddenly, the No. 10 seed in a 12-team bracket has made it all the way to the title game, even if there isn't much of a \"Cinderella\" vibe around a program that won four national championships in an eight-year span from 1983-91 and put together some of the most talented teams in college football history around the turn of the century. But while there isn't much of a Cinderella angle to attach to Miami, there certainly is an underdog angle, and some of that comes with the opponent in No. 1 Indiana. The betting spread for the College Football Playoff National Championship has the Hurricanes as an underdog of more than a touchdown, so what are the keys to Miami once again exceeding expectations and handing the Hoosiers their first loss of the season? Let's get into the pivot points for the matchup.  1. Pass rush has to be dominant Miami leads all FBS teams with 47 sacks on the season, and that pass rush has been the key unlocking the year-over-year defensive improvement that pushed the Hurricanes over the edge. A 10-win team one year ago, Miami gave up far too many explosive plays and had to rely too much on Cam Ward for answers and second half heroics. Now Miami is giving up less explosive plays and creating big-time negative plays on their own with the dynamic duo of Rueben Bain and Akheem Mesidor. Bain, in particular, has been elite in the playoff wins against Texas A&M and Ohio State with four sacks and 5.5 tackles for loss combined in the two wins. \nBut against Ole Miss? Zero pressures and zero tackles for loss. Ole Miss allotted for extra help in the form of double teams and also utilized tempo to limit the opportunities for Miami's defense to get set and tee off on the quarterback. Bain still finished with a good performance (five recorded pressures), but the absence of those game-changing negative plays did put more responsibility on Carson Beck and the offense to score against the Rebels' defense. There's a step up in competition in terms of what Miami's offense will be facing in the title game, so it's an absolute must that one of the nation's best pass rushing teams lives up to its reputation on Monday night. It does not have to be Bain, specifically, as Mesidor or a number of defenders could end up delivering the timely sack or tackle for loss to help Miami's efforts to win. But anyone who has watched Miami, and certainly any of the NFL teams looking forward to drafting him in the spring, know that Bain is a player capable of taking a game over. If Miami is going to play its best football, Bain needs to be a big part of the picture. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            2. Win the time of possession battle The strength of Miami's offense starts at the line of scrimmage, behind an offensive line that bunches up tight and plows forward to create room for the run game and keep a clean pocket for Beck on pass plays. They've got certified future pros individually but also an outstanding collective understanding of how to play together, and close wins in the playoff have highlighted just how crucial it is for Miami to be able to string together long drives behind that line. The bruising approach allows for Miami to lean on you for four quarters and then be stronger in the crucial short-yardage situations, while also lulling a defense into mistake that could spring a long Mark Fletcher run when you least expect it. And when you're running the football effectively and leaning on the defense for four quarters, it usually leads to winning the time of possession battle. Miami's edge controlling the football has been a factor all season long, and entering the title game, the Hurricanes rank 5th nationally in time of possession averaging approximately 33:42 minutes per game. Of the four teams ahead of Miami, two are service academies (Army and Air Force), so it's fair to argue that among non-option teams the Hurricanes are one of the most ball dominant teams in the country. The issue, at least in terms of projecting the edge in the national championship game, is that Indiana is 6th nationally with an average time of possession that is approximately 25 seconds less than Miami on the season. It is not possible for both teams to possess the football for 33 minutes, so clearly something has to give when it comes to winning third downs to extend drives and taking care of the football. \n3. Mistake-free football from the offense Speaking of taking care of the football, Miami needs to make sure it avoids the kind of errors that doomed them in both of their losses and nearly became an issue in the CFP semifinal win against Ole Miss. The Hurricanes are 104th nationally in penalties assessed per game and 84th in penalty yards per game. Indiana, on the other hand, is top five in both categories. The absence of mistakes was a highlight of the win against Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl, as Miami slayed the dragon that was the betting favorite to win it all with zero accepted penalties and a +1 advantage in terms of turnover margin. The Hurricanes lost a fumble early in the game but didn't allow Ohio State to take advantage, then picked off Julian Sayin twice and ran one of those back the other way for a touchdown. The same story played out the week before against Texas A&M as Malachi Toney did lose a fumble in the fourth quarter that appeared incredibly costly, but with two interceptions and a fumble recovery, the defense made sure that Miami finished with a +2 in turnover margin. Then against Ole Miss we saw Carson Beck throw his first interception of the playoff run, and the team as a whole commit nine penalties. Procedural penalties on offense and holding calls can be absolute drive-killers, but so could multiple interceptions, like Beck's performances in losses to Louisville (four picks) and SMU (two picks). You could probably copy and paste the \"play a clean game\" key for any team in any year when it comes to the high stakes of the national championship and high quality of teams that make it this far in the College Football Playoff, but it feels particularly poignant when we're talking about these two teams. Indiana's deserved reputation is as a team that does not make mistakes or beat itself and can capitalize on your mistakes to increase its competitive edge. Miami, on the other hand, is a few mental errors away from giving Indiana that edge. If the Hurricanes play the same kind of clean game they did against Ohio State, the team will be in the mix to win deep into the second half. But if Miami starts turning the ball over and committing costly penalties early, it could be a long night in Hard Rock Stadium. \n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            4. Malachi Toney splash plays Is there anything Malachi Toney can't do? Miami's superstar freshman has had an amazing journey, growing up in the area with an affection for \"The U\" and even the motivation to re-classify and join the program as a 17-year-old in January 2025. A three-star prospect with obvious speed, Toney won over the coaching staff with his work ethic and preparation coming into the season. He was a well-kept secret until he exploded in the season opener against Notre Dame with six catches for 82 yards and a touchdown. From there, he has become among the most consistently effective skill players in the country. Toney has at least five catches in 13 of Miami's 15 games this season, and he leads the team in both receiving yards (1,089) and receiving touchdowns (9) while also serving as a dangerous piece of the run game and working as a punt returner. His success throughout the season has brought plenty of defensive attention here in the College Football Playoff, but that hasn't prevented him from using his game-changing athleticism to make plays -- like when he blew past the Ole Miss defense to connect with Carson Beck on a 36-yard go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl. When the money is on the table, your best players have to be your best players. Toney is a superstar and the kind of game-breaker that can turn ordinary bubble screens in to extraordinary explosive plays. Offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson has had a 1,000-yard receiver in each of his three seasons as Mario Cristobal's offensive coordinator, but things seem different with Toney. The intention with which he is moved around the offense and given the opportunities to make a splash play are for very good reason, and given the competition, it's going to require Toney and the offense to cash in on those opportunities if Miami is going to be successful. \n5. Decision-making on the sideline Few coaches have done more to improve their stock during this postseason than Mario Cristobal. Long considered one of the elite recruiters in the game, Cristobal had stacked up a collection of criticism when it comes to game management. Choosing not to take a knee in an eventual loss against Georgia Tech in 2023 is the over-simplified poster child of that criticism, but fourth down decisions and timeout usage as well have spots where Cristobal hasn't necessarily been held to the same standard as other coaches who recruit at his level. Lazy narratives are still narratives until results force them to change, and Miami has forced the conversation to change around Cristobal because of the way he has prepared his team and coached in wins against Notre Dame, Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss. He's gone toe-to-toe with a couple of the top coaches and definitely a handful of the most talented rosters, yet continuously led the way to reputation-changing wins. You might have scratched your head at the decision to kick a chip shot field goal in the third quarter at Texas A&M or some timeout usage along the way, but Cristobal is pressing the right buttons to get his players to play their best football when the stakes are the highest. That, more than anything, signifies some good coaching. Now, all that said … there very well could be a moment, or several moments, where the College Football Playoff National Championship is hinging on a decision from the Miami sideline. Fourth down calls, end-of-half scenarios and halftime adjustments will all be paramount to setting up the Hurricanes for their best shot to knock off No. 1 Indiana. If the ghosts of decision making past are lurking around Hard Rock Stadium, an old lazy narrative could suddenly become very loud. But Cristobal aces this test and delivers the program's sixth national championship, we will discuss it as one of the great stories in college football history. After being lost in the wilderness for two decades, Miami and its former player turned head coach will be finally freed of the burden stemming from frequently having the talent but rarely delivering the results.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Curt Cignetti's eye for talent may be his superpower. He knows exactly what he wants. He knows how to develop the talent into stars. And he knows how to build a culture to make the stars want to stay even as more money and more traditional powerhouse programs beckon elsewhere.No, we're not talking about Cignetti's ability to find talent such as Fernando Mendoza, though he is clearly elite at doing so. This is about Cignetti's eye for … coaching talent. \n        \n            \n                Who are these guys? The roster behind Indiana's impossible run\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHow does Cignetti turn around programs like Indiana so quickly? He has a traveling squad of like-minded loyalists who have chips on their shoulder and are obsessed with being prepared for any possible scenario. His top two deputies, offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and defensive coordinator Bryant Haines, have been with him for more than a decade as Cignetti went from Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) to Elon to James Madison and, finally, Indiana. Five on-field coaches have been with Cignetti at multiple stops, plus strength and conditioning coach Derek Owings. \nAnd, in Monday's College Football Playoff national championship against Miami, two former proteges will even be on the opposing sideline trying to deny Cignetti college football immortality. Miami defensive coordinator Corey Hetherman (JMU) and running backs coach Matt Merritt (JMU/Elon) both spent multiple seasons with Cignetti. \"He does a great job of hiring people,\" IUP head coach Paul Tortorella told CBS Sports. \"Not only good football coaches, but good people. He didn't make many mistakes.\"Tortorella has been at IUP since 1995, arriving at the Division-II school to work as Frank Cignetti Sr.'s defensive coordinator. He stayed on when Frank Sr -- known as \"the Big Guy\" around the school -- left and later when his son, Curt, arrived. It was a big deal for the small school that not only was another Cignetti leading the way, but that he left Alabama to do so. \nNot that there weren't some hiccups along the way as the younger Cignetti got accustomed to his new surroundings. One day, early on in Cignetti's offseason program, he turned to his defensive coordinator and asked him where all the cones were. \"They're all out there, Curt,\" Tortorella said. \"You mean to tell me we only got eight cones?\" Cignetti asked incredulously. \"Yeah, that's what we got,\" Tortorella said back. \"He looked at me like I was crazy,\" Tortorella said. \"I laughed about it and we got some more cones. I mean not only was it Division I but he was at Alabama. It doesn't get any better than that. For whatever one thing we had at IUP, they had 150 of those at Alabama.\"\nWhile he didn't have much money to offer assistants at IUP, he focused on identifying young coaching talent and trusting his abilities to develop them. Cignetti liked what he saw from a 26-year old West Virginia Wesleyan offensive coordinator and brought him in as his offensive coordinator. That was Luke Getsy, who would later go on to be an offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears and Las Vegas Raiders. There's a track record of IUP assistants going on to success in the NFL. Cignetti Sr. once hired a young defensive backs coach from Division III named Nick Sirianni, who impressed those in the building with a maniacal thirst for football that long solo nights in the office until 2 a.m. could hardly quench. Sirianni's career of course exploded from there as he made a meteoric rise up the NFL ranks before eventually becoming the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl-winning head coach. There were plenty of personality and coaching differences between Cignetti Sr. and his eldest son, Curt, including how long to practice, but they share this uncanny skill. Said Tortorella: \"I think they probably have that same trait that they can see something in young coaches.\"\nShanahan and Haines have been with Cignetti since the IUP days, when they were only receiving $6,000 stipends. Cignetti liked the pedigree each had -- Shanahan came highly recommended after a stint as a graduate assistant at Pittsburgh while Haines spent a year under Urban Meyer at Ohio State. They were grinders, just like Cignetti. Indiana's 2025 coaching staffCoachTitleYears w/CignettiBryant HainesDefensive coordinator/LB coach11Mike ShanahanOffensive coordinator/WR coach4Grant CainSpecial teams coordinator/TE coach7Ola AdamsSafeties, defensive backs coach2Bob BostadOffensive line coach/run game coordinator2Pat KuntzDefensive tackles coach4John MillerRunning backs coach6Rod OjongCornerbacks coach2Chandler WhitmerQB coach/Co-offensive coordinator1Buddha WilliamsDefensive ends coach2Derek OwingsDirector of Athletic Performance (S&C)6Cignetti possessed an elite football mind and he could see it blooming in young coaches. He had that rare ability to differentiate between the deep-sea divers and the snorkelers, the guys who actually lived and breathed football versus the ones who liked what it could do for them. Haines came in as defensive line coach and also the strength and conditioning coach -- a double-duty you'd never see at the FBS level. Shanahan, a former Pitt wide receiver who bears no relation to the NFL's Shanahan dynasty, took over the receivers room. \n\"He found those guys as stipend coaches and those poor guys were barely making ends meet, and he was loyal to them,\" said Steve Roach, who worked as IUP's AD during Cignetti's time. \"They were loyal to him. It says a lot about the chemistry between (Cignetti, Shanahan and Haines) especially.\" Cignetti has rewarded that loyalty over and over again. From once making $6,000, Haines and Shanahan are now two of the highest-paid assistant coaches in college football. As Cignetti got things rolling and the young deputies proved worthy, he'd give them more and more responsibilities. He actually listened to his coaches too, and made them feel valued when they came up with good ideas. He liked promoting from within, though sometimes there was a can't-miss external coach he had to have. Like Corey Hetherman. Now Miami's defensive coordinator and a Broyles Award finalist for the nation's top assistant, Hetherman was FCS Maine's defensive coordinator. Cignetti loved what he saw from Maine's attacking defense and brought on Hetherman as the DC on his first James Madison staff. When Hetherman left three years later for a job at Rutgers, Cignetti promoted Haines to his first defensive coordinator job. \nCignetti's eye for coaching staff talent has served him well at every stop.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The results have spoken for themselves. Hetherman's Miami defense ranks first nationally in sacks, fifth in scoring defense, fifth in SP+ defensive rankings, sixth in rushing defense and 11th overall in total defense. Haines' IU defense has been even better -- second in SP+ rankings, second in scoring defense, second in rushing defense and fourth in total defense. \"It's the same thing that he finds in the transfer portal with recruits -- it's production over potential,\" Haines explained. \"He hired Corey Hetherman as the defensive coordinator because Cory was leading Maine, and Maine's defense was incredible, he had produced at Maine. Those things matter to Coach Cignetti. \"I've produced as a position coach, as a co-defensive coordinator for Coach Cignetti, those things matter. It's not about the guy that's leaving Texas that's never called a play. It's do I know this guy holds a certain standard and is going to execute his job description even as a coach?\" \nOnce Cignetti gets a keeper like Haines in the building, he treats him well. His short practices are the stuff of legend now -- when IUP was rolling they were as short as 60 minutes, according to Tortorella -- and he does his best not to grind his staff into dust. Cignetti is a film freak, always breaking down tape and looking for an edge, and that flows throughout the organization. But he's never been the kind of guy to stay at the office until 2 a.m. just to prove he's working harder. He pushed his staff to be efficient and organized, but to still try to have a life outside football. When things slowed down, he'd like to golf with some of his assistant coaches. If he didn't think a coach needed to still be in the office, he'd tell him to go home. \"He treats his staff really well, and by that, I mean we're not working ungodly hours,\" said James Ferguson, who worked with Cignetti at IUP, Elon and JMU. \"He kept his staff fresh as well as the players. And that's why I think you see that continual success because he rewards the loyalty.\"\nIt's one reason why Haines turned down programs like Ohio State and Penn State a year ago. It's a reason why Shanahan turned down Group of Five head coaching opportunities this cycle. The coaches are well-compensated into the millions, they know exactly what Cignetti expects from them (and vice versa) and they are winning in a way no one thought possible at Indiana. It has temporarily limited the growth of Cignetti's coaching tree, but it's a matter of when, not if, the two Indiana coordinators become head coaches. With that loyalty comes a staff that has a strong argument for the nation's best. Indiana is so well-prepared and so well-coached, and that shines through every time you watch the Hoosiers play. Indiana's nation's best plus-21 turnover margin isn't happenstance, it's the result of a coaching staff all moving in the same direction. Indiana rarely gives up big plays, doesn't give up many points and has the ability to beat you a number of ways offensively. Tortorella, who took over the IUP program after Cignetti left, has enjoyed watching Indiana's postseason run. He's not particularly surprised by any of it, not after working so closely with Cig, Haines and others. \n\"They are the best-coached team in America,\" he said. \"There ain't any question. They are the best coached team in America in all three phases.\"\n            ",

We can tell you he's leaning Under the 46 point total, but to see his official ATS pick for this game you'll need to go to SportsLine. Bills -1.5: \"If the Broncos have one advantage this week, it's the fact that they're coming off a bye while the Bills will be coming off a short week after playing on Sunday in the wild card round. Not only are the Bills on a short week, but they have to deal with the mile high air. It's not an easy adjustment and it's a big reason why the Broncos have won four straight home playoff games. Also, Sean Payton has NEVER lost a playoff game coming off a bye (4-0). He's the new Andy Reid. The only thing standing between the Broncos and their first AFC title berth in 10 years is Josh Allen, but unfortunately for Denver, that's a big obstacle. In the wild card round, Allen led his first career game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game, and now, I'll say he takes one step closer to getting to his first career Super Bowl.\" -- CBS Sports NFL writer John Breech on why he has Buffalo pulling out the 23-20 win over Denver.

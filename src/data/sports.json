    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention on Monday night, as they were defeated by Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, 28-15. The Dolphins entered this prime-time matchup riding a four-game winning streak, but were simply beat down by a better team. The status of starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is again being questioned, as he completed 22 of 28 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception on Monday night. The box score doesn't tell the entire story. Tagovailoa's two passing touchdowns came in the fourth quarter when Miami was already trailing by double digits, and the Dolphins went a putrid 2 of 8 on third downs.Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel was asked by reporters on Tuesday if he was considering a quarterback change. McDaniel confirmed he was.  \"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said.Who would McDaniel start if he were to bench Tagovailoa?\n\"Well I think that we are in the process of game-planning for the Cincinnati Bengals, so in that process, we are trying to determine who will give us the best chance to win and I'll probably give you more clarity on that tomorrow, as we are 14 hours removed from the game,\" McDaniel responded. The Dolphins have two other quarterbacks on roster: Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson and rookie Quinn Ewers. If Tagovailoa were to be benched, it may be Wilson who is handed the keys to the offense, as Ewers was the designated QB3 on Monday night.In 14 games this season, Tagovailoa has completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The former Pro Bowler has appeared to have regressed this season. In 2022, Tagovailoa led the NFL in yards per attempt and passer rating. The following year, he led the NFL in passing yards with 4,624. That led to him signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. \nThe Dolphins cannot easily move on from Tagovailoa if they choose to do so this offseason. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, it's possible this week could mark the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the dust settled on the first round of the 2024 College Football Playoff, critics were ready to throw out the entire 12-team system. SMU got shellacked by Penn State, 38-10. Tennessee was outclassed against Ohio State, 42-17. In fact, first round games in the last CFP were decided by an average of 19.3 points. The nominal closest was a 10-point win by Notre Dame against Indiana. The Fighting Irish were up 24-3 at one point as the Hoosiers pulled close in garbage time. That first weekend was disappointing enough that many dismissed the entire size and structure of the field. However, don't fall into believing that's an inevitability of the system. The 2025 bracket will not suffer that same fate. The biggest reason for the change is simple: They fixed the bracket. Last year, conference champions were guaranteed a first-round bye. Because of that, the 5-seed and 6-seed in the field were actually No. 3 and 4 in the country. A first-round game between Texas and Clemson positioned No. 3 against No. 16. \n\n        \n            \n                Ranking the 25 best players in the College Football Playoff: Ohio State, Miami standouts lead the way\n                \n                    Blake Brockermeyer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat dynamic isn't completely gone, but it will improve dramatically with the matchups on deck. In the first round of the 2025 playoff, there's a heavyweight battle between No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 10 Miami at Kyle Field, two teams that flashed serious national championship upside. Then, No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Alabama rematch their game from November, when the Sooners forced three turnovers to eke out a two-point victory in Tuscaloosa. James Madison will likely find itself in rough waters against Oregon, but the SP+ ratings believe the game stays within two touchdowns. And then, there's a fascinating rematch between a Tulane squad set to lose its staff with an Ole Miss team going through transition after the departure of Lane Kiffin to LSU. The first game featured transfer quarterback Jake Retzlaff making his second start and having a miserable game. The staff has figured out many more effective ways to use him since then. Granted, there's a good chance that at least one of the Group of Six matchups turns into a major blowout. Earlier this season, Ole Miss smacked Tulane 45-10. However, both the Dukes and Green Wave are far more fully formed than they were in September. \nAnd then, the two Power Four matchups have major implications. Texas A&M vs. Miami features two of the best trench teams in the entire College Football Playoff. Oklahoma is one of the nation's best defenses, while Alabama boasts more recruiting talent than anyone else. Neither game has the makings of a blowout; both teams are both too good and too flawed for that. It's easy to believe that the first round of the playoff is just doomed after seeing the lows of last season. But really, there's plenty of reasons to believe that many of the biggest issues were unique to a single season. More than any other, the biggest reason for the unbalanced first round last season resided in Columbus, Ohio. Ohio State frankly ruined the structure of the bracket after its head-scratching loss to Michigan last season. The most talented team in the country fell to the No. 8 seed because of its own indefensible stumbles. There isn't any such case in 2025. \nAnd really, it's harder than ever to create the kind of superteams that defined the late four-team playoff era because of NIL and the transfer portal. Following the 2022 season, the SP+ gap between the No. 5 and 10 teams in the country was nine points. This year, it's fewer than four points. The upper middle class of the sport is rising. Games are only getting more competitive as a result. When the 2025 College Football Playoff kicks off on Friday, Alabama and Oklahoma will provide a close, physical matchup. Texas A&M and Miami will feature national-caliber quarterbacks and playmakers. Ole Miss and Tulane each boast dynamic quarterbacks. Both James Madison and Oregon are incredibly well coached, even if multiple coaches on each staff are heading to new pastures very soon. There were low moments of the first 12-team College Football Playoff last year, but observers need to be patient. Every year is unique, and the flaws of a given year don't necessarily carry over to the next one. \n            ",

I wouldn't say it is a bad week, but it is certainly a strange week. On my first run of projections, Jacoby Brissett came out as QB3, and last week's QB1, Trevor Lawrence, is not in the top 12. There are four QBs I have projected for at least 22 Fantasy points; if you have one of them, you don't have much to think about. They are Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, Brissett, and Jared Goff. Then the fun starts. I have 12 QBs projected between 20 Fantasy points and 21.6. One of the most challenging is Matthew Stafford.Stafford is QB2 on the season. I understand if you are starting him without reservation. But he is also at Seattle, on a short week, likely without Davante Adams. Those three circumstances don't exactly inspire confidence. The Seahawks have given up seven combined Fantasy points to the last three QBs they have faced. Stafford had 17 points when he faced this defense at home in Week 11. At the very least, I would certainly start the four QBs above over him. I would also start Jaxson Dart, Dak Prescott, Brock Purdy, and  Drake Maye over him without thinking much about it. The two difficult choices that came out higher in the projections are Justin Herbert and Bo Nix.Herbert is facing a Cowboys defense that has given up the most Fantasy points to opposing QBs. Nix is at home against Jacksonville, and he has been a much better Fantasy QB at home than on the road. Neither of these are easy calls and ultimately come down to your personal preference. Part of that is your preference in terms of who you think will perform better. Part of it is who will cause you to lose more sleep if you bench them and they go bananas.Let's get to the rest of the Week 16 preview:\n\n        Week 16 QB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    QB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            26.6 -- The 26.6 Fantasy points Jacoby Brissett scored against the Texans in Week 15 is the most any QB has scored against them all season.6.1 -- Joe Burrow is averaging 6.1 yards per pas attempt, the lowest mark of his career.23.97 -- Bo Nix is averaging 23.97 FPPG in seven home games this year.

There is not a QB available in even 30% of CBS leagues that ranks inside my top 18 this week. You do not want to stream a quarterback in Fantasy playoffs. But I understand some of you lose Patrick Mahomes last week and still advanced. If you have no other options, I would stream Tyler Shough before Gardner Minshew or Marcus Mariota. Shough has scored 20 Fantasy points in three straight starts, and he has a home game against the Jets, who just gave up 53 points to Trevor Lawrence.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n

They are definitely trending the right direction. RJ Harvey was as well before his Week 15 injury. He is one of three injured backs we will be watching closely heading into Week 16.Harvey left Week 15 with a rib injury, and like Zonovan Knight and Devin Neal, he is questionable for Week 16 as of Tuesday morning. Thankfully, if the ribs are okay to play, we probably don't have as much reinjury risk as we would with a hamstring. In other words, if Harvey goes, he is a start, even in a difficult matchup against Jacksonville. If Harvey is out, like we are currently projecting, I would expect a committee approach led by Jaleel McLaughlin. As of Tuesday morning, I have McLaughlin projected for 16 touches and 11.5 full PPR Fantasy points. That would make him a flex, not a starter, but someone who should be added off waivers.Knight also left in Week 15, and we got some of the best clarity we have had in this backfield since James Conner's injury. Michael carter played 79.4% of the offensive snaps, handled 66.7% of the team's rush attempts, and had a 10% target share. This week, the Cardinals face a Falcons defense that has given up 21.8 PPR FPPG to running backs. If Knight is out, Carter could score you 15 Fantasy points and be a top 20 running back. He is likely the best waiver wire add at any position unless we get news that Knight is okay before waivers run.Finally, the Saints lost Devin Neal after he scored a touchdown in Week 15. This is a hamstring injury, which makes me extremely worried even if he tries to play this week. The Saints are home favorites, but the Jets just held Travis Etienne to 2.67 yards per carry. View Neal as a low-end RB2 if he tries to go. If he's out, this will be another committee with Audric Estime and Evan Hull splitting duties. We would not want to start either one.Now let's get to the rest of the Week 16 RB Preview:\n\n        Week 16 RB Preview\n    \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Numbers to know\n                \n                    \n            3.43 -- The Lions are giving up 3.43 catches per game to running backs, the second-lowest mark in the league. Aaron Rodgers has thrown to running backs at the third-highest rate. This is a fascinating matchup.21 -- TreVeyon Henderson is averaging 21 PPR FPPG since Week 9. Jahmyr Gibbs, Christian McCaffrey, and De'Von Achane are the only running backs averaging more in that stretch.5.89 -- The Giants are giving up a league-worst 5.89 yards per carry to running backs. That's more than half a yard more per carry than the lowly Bengals.82 -- Cardinals running backs have caught 82 passes this season, nearly six per game. Even if Michael Carter only gets half of that, it helps his floor and his ceiling.0 -- Bucky Irving has zero rush attempts inside the five-yard line this year.41.7% -- Kenneth Walker played 41.7% of the offensive snaps in Week 15, his lowest total since Week 6. He has 47 yards from scrimmage in his last two games combined.\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n

the starter, and I would not be surprised if Carter sees a larger share of the snaps and work than Knight did. Last week, Carter was RB19 against the Texans with 18 touches and 13.4 PPR Fantasy points. That is very close to what I project for him this week if Knight is out.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DEN\n                    \n                         \n                        Denver\n                    \n                                            • #38\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        JAC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    DEN -3\n                                    O/U 45.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                4th\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                36th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ROSTERED\n                                \n                                24%\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    69\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    10\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    3.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                This is a bad matchup, and we aren't sure yet that Harvey will miss Week 16.

In those games, he has averaged 10.2 PPR Fantasy points, but he only actually scored double-digits in three of 10 games.

His coach says he could have come back into the game. For that reason, we are ranking him this week, in a home game, as a 14.5-point favorite, with an implied total of 26. This is the kind of guy who should be chalk, but he just was, and it didn't pay off. I expect Fantasy managers will look somewhere else in DFS this week, which makes Marks a great contrarian play.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    RB Preview\n                \n                            \n                    Heath's Projections\n                \n                    \n            My full set of Week 16 Fantasy football projections for every position are now available on SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        The thing about \"statement wins\" is they only last until another statement is made; the NFL, after all, is a \"What have you done for me lately?\" league.So when the Jaguars followed up a \"Monday Night Football'' triumph over the Chiefs with losses to the Seahawks and Rams, a one-point overtime escape against the Raiders and a 19-point fourth-quarter collapse to the Davis Mills-led Texans, the statement seemed to be these were the same ole' Jaguars.Actually, there were more questions than statements.Was Trevor Lawrence really the answer at quarterback? Was Liam Coen really the answer at coach? Was James Gladstone really the answer at general manager? Was the Travis Hunter experiment -- a costly one that required them moving up to the No. 2 draft pick -- already a complete bust? The Jaguars were 5-4.That was then. This is now: The Jaguars have won five straight games, a streak that includes impressive wins over the Chargers by 29 points and the Colts by 17. In a a 48-20 Week 15 blowout of the Jets, Lawrence became the first player ever to throw for five touchdowns and run for at least 50 yards and a touchdown in a game.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 Power Rankings: Two plays may have just changed the Packers' season and the NFC playoff race\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThough Sunday's performance was the historic one, Lawrence has been trending in the right direction for a while -- during the entirety of this five-game winning streak, in fact.Trevor Lawrence this seasonWeeks 1-10Weeks 11-15Yards per attempt6.38.6TD-Int10-713-4Negative play rate10.2%6.7%Air yards per attempt8.010.0Expected points added per dropback-0.070.22Based on that last line, Lawrence has gone from playing at a level equivalent to Justin Fields to producing like a top-five quarterback league-wide. For context, Drake Maye leads the NFL at 0.23 expected points added per dropback this season. So, what's happened?Lawrence using his strengths more: mobility, big arm shiningGiven the unsteady nature of Lawrence's NFL career so far, it's easy to forget how highly regarded he was coming out of Clemson in 2021. A big reason for that pedigree was his athletic skills: big arm, good athlete, mobile, able to create. Those attributes have shown up from time to time during his pro career, but never as consistently as they are right now.Of all the plays Lawrence made against the Jets, his two best were ones where all of those skills were on display. First, this touchdown run, where he jukes out Will McDonald IV and beats everyone else to the end zone.\nSecond, this incredible 33-yard throw to Parker Washington:\nYes, the Jaguars won easily and, yes, it was against the Jets, but those are two of the most impressive plays you will see from any quarterback this season.Not including kneeldowns, Lawrence has 21 carries for 131 yards and two touchdowns over the past five games, good for 6.2 yards per carry over that span.But the downfield throwing has really been impressive. Sunday, Pro Football Focus listed Lawrence as 10 for 14 for a career-high 212 yards on throws 10+ yards downfield. Look at how much of the field he accesses.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            Since Week 11, Lawrence is completing a league-best 61% of his throws at least 10 yards downfield (and that's despite four drops). Only 8.2% of those throws have been off targets, the second-lowest rate in the league and a massive development for a player who can struggle with inaccuracy. He also hasn't had a single turnover-worthy throw on those attempts.\"Definitely this is as confident as I've felt,\" Lawrence said after Week 15. \"Just the feeling in our locker room and our team and our offense. It's been fun.\"The Jakobi Meyers effectSome scoffed when Gladstone said Meyers' superpower was \"not dropping the football\" after acquiring him from the Raiders. But for a Jacksonville team that led the league in drops (24) and drop rate (8.6%) at the time, perhaps simply catching the ball really was a superpower.Meyers has been so much more, though. During the five-game winning streak, he has caught 24 of 35 targets for 314 yards, three touchdowns and 19 first downs. The 19 first down receptions are tied for eighth-most in the NFL over that span.He is also opening up an area previously inaccessible for Lawrence: the middle of the field. Over the past five weeks, Myers has been by far the NFL's best wide receiver in this area. eight catches on 11 targets are 160 yards on \"In\" routes. All three categories lead the NFL. It has made a world of difference for Lawrence, too.Trevor Lawrence throwing \"In\" routes this seasonTargeting Jakobi MeyersTargeting anyone elseComp pct73%48%Yards per attempt14.58.0Passer rating107.275.1Meyers, a former quarterback, has impressed Lawrence and offensive coordinator Grant Udinski with his feel for the game.\"There's a lot of different examples that show his feel,\" Udinski said last week. \"I think the first one that shows up is kind of his feel in space. You see some of these teams playing zone coverage where they have defenders who have vision on the quarterback and they have different spots to get to and different landmarks, or they're reading off of what our routes are to kind of determine what their drop's going to be. He has a feel for where those defenders are going, where they're trying to get to, and then where his route fits off of that. And that kind of takes a second and third level order of processing, not just to know we tell you to get to this spot, but this spot is going to open up because we're telling you to get to a spot that looks covered.\"It really shows on the \"In\" routes, where Lawrence is often throwing to spaces Meyers is yet to inhabit.That's high-level trust between quarterback and wide receiver, even if they've only been teammates for a month and a half.\nWith Meyers excelling on those routes, Brian Thomas Jr. is getting more vertical opportunities, and he is playing well once again after an inconsistent start to the year; he had 87 yards in Week 14 and 66 more (and a touchdown) in Week 15. His average depth of target has gone way up with Meyers in the fold, and the big plays have returned.It's hard to say Meyers has revolutionized this offense, but he has absolutely made a huge difference as a perimeter wide receiver able to do the dirty work, go over the middle and catch the ball consistently. The Jaguars have made a lot of moves for wide receivers recently; Meyers has been by far their most successful.\"We had a lot a of respect for Jakobi watching him over the years, whether it was in New England or in Vegas, knowing that he was going to be able to come in and make an immediate impact on our offense,\" Coen said. \"I think it's helped open up not just the confidence that Trevor has being able to throw and catch, but also helps open up some other guys, right? Where you've got a few other people that the defense has to identify and defend, and ultimately you're trying to make the defense defend every blade of grass, that's both vertically and horizontally. He's been huge for our offense.\"What's ahead?This is Lawrence at his best: the intermediate and deep throws, the scrambling, the negative play avoidance (zero sacks in three of the five games during the winning streak) ... it's all adding up. During its five game winning streak, Jacksonville is averaging a league-high 34.2 points per game and is first in yards per pass attempt.\nLawrence and Jacksonville both get opportunities to prove they belong over the coming weeks: A Week 16 game at the AFC-leading Broncos awaits, followed by a trip to the Colts. The Jaguars finish the season with a home game against the Titans. The next two games will be significant tests. Denver has arguably the league's best defense, with cornerbacks who thrive in man-to-man coverage. Indianapolis will be desperately looking to win and keep pace in the AFC playoff race.But behind Lawrence, the Jaguars have a one-game lead in the AFC South with three games left, a resurgence few could have seen coming. SportsLine gives them a 50% chance to win the division and a 98% chance to make the playoffs.\"We have to continue to build on that and can't get complacent,\" Lawrence said. \"There's still a lot more ahead of us. Some big games are coming up, so we have to continue to push and get better. There are still things we need to clean up, but it's been a lot of fun. I feel great, feel confident. I think our whole offense feels this way.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The competitive portion of the Kansas City Chiefs' season is over. That was perhaps true even before Patrick Mahomes went down with a torn ACL during the final drive of their Week 15 loss to the division-rival Los Angeles Chargers (the Chiefs would have needed a field goal to tie the game or a touchdown to win it and keep their playoff hopes alive, and they didn't have much time left), but Mahomes' injury obviously drove the final nail into the Chiefs' coffin.There have been and will be plenty post-mortem articles on what went wrong for the Chiefs this season. The offense largely struggled outside of a 5-to-6 week stretch in the middle of the season with plenty of blame to go around from Mahomes himself to Andy Reid to the offensive line and the skill-position corps. The defense never rounded into elite form like it had down the stretch of some other seasons under Steve Spagnuolo. And unlike in previous years, the Chiefs couldn't make up for their flaws by winning consistently in close games.With the book on this season now mostly closed, it's worth taking a look at some of the big-picture issues that the Chiefs will face this offseason as they prepare for 2026. Because Mahomes is the centerpiece of the offense, we're going to focus on that side of the ball -- except for in the salary cap section, where some defensive players' contract situations can obviously have a knock-on effect on what happens with the offense.The Mahomes injury and scheme effectsThe Chiefs are going to prepare for Mahomes to return in time for Week 1 of the 2026 season, CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported. Mahomes is almost certainly going to attack his rehabilitation with a maniacal fervor, and it wouldn't necessarily be surprising if he were indeed ready for the start of the year.\nIf he is ready to play, he's also almost certainly not going to be the same player we've seen through the first eight years of his career. Specifically, his ability to move around inside and outside the pocket to create plays with second and even third reactions is likely to be diminished. That ability is part of what made and makes him great. If he has to play a different style, even if just for a while until he returns to full health, then that will have a dramatic impact on Kansas City's offense.The Chiefs likely have to account for that within the design of their offense, which for years has probably placed too much stress on Mahomes' ability to make magic happen outside the structure of the play. You don't want him to suddenly become a statue in the pocket, of course, but acknowledging that he may not be able to move around as often or as well seems prudent.Evolving the scheme to reflect the fact that their quarterback is likely not going to be the same type of player is imperative, but the Chiefs were also likely to have to undergo some schematic evolution anyway. Too often this season, they seemed like they were just running their offense from five years ago but without the personnel to make it work the way it did then.\nFiguring out ways to give easy buttons to Mahomes and the skill-position players will be important, especially in the wake of his injury. Whether that means incorporating new concepts from other offensive systems or dressing up the same system in different ways to account for the way defenses play Mahomes, it has to happen whenever he returns to the field.There is, of course, also the possibility that he's not actually ready for the start of the season and has to sit out for a few weeks or even longer. If that's the case, we have no idea who will be under center for the Chiefs. Backup Gardner Minshew isn't under contract for next year, and neither is practice-squad quarterback Chris Oladokun. Kansas City may decide to prioritize a better backup for next season in the event that Mahomes isn't looking likely to start -- or just in case he has to miss time again.Dec 14, 2025; Kansas City, Missouri, USA; Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) celebrates with tight end Travis Kelce (87) after rushing for a touchdown against the Los Angeles Chargers during the first quarter at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jay Biggerstaff-Imagn Images \n                                                                    Jay Biggerstaff\n                                                            Travis Kelce's's futureKelce turned 36 in October. His contract is up at the end of the season. He's planning a wedding to one of the most famous people on the planet. Not having the chance to make a playoff run in his final act would sting, but it'd also be understandable if he decided to hang up his spikes and if the Week 18 game against the Raiders is the last time we see him in a Chiefs uniform.\nGiven his age, his tremendous accomplishments (he is a no-doubt-about-it first-ballot Hall of Famer), his somewhat diminished recent performance (his 4.8 catches per game this season are his fewest since 2015; and while he's been better in 2025, his 2024 performance was alarming enough that if he weren't Travis Kelce, he might not have even been on the Chiefs this season), his off-field successes (his podcast with his brother is one of the biggest in the world, he's ventured into acting and hosting roles, etcetera) and his personal life (he's about to be Mr. Taylor Swift), it honestly might be more surprising if he didn't call it quits.The only reason I can see that he wouldn't is if he really wants to be around for Mahomes' comeback and one more chance at a playoff run. Given the reality of the Chiefs' situation, though, he would probably have to come back at a significantly reduced salary and in a reduced role, which may or may not be agreeable.Kansas City almost certainly needs to evolve its offense beyond one that features Kelce as the primary pass catcher. It has tried that over the past two seasons to mixed results, partly because Kelce himself is still around and it's hard to shunt him to the side entirely (especially given that he has been better this year than he was a year ago) and partly because the other pieces of the offense have been alternately injured and not nearly effective enough in their roles to justify turning Kelce into a secondary or tertiary passing-game option. (More on that in a moment.)\nIf he does decide to retire, the Chiefs will have no choice but to dramatically reshape their offense in terms of both personnel (Noah Gray and Jared Wiley are the only tight ends under guaranteed contract for next season) and focus.The skill-position corpsKansas City is not nearly explosive enough at the offensive skill positions, which is just a wild place to be given that the Chiefs had the most explosive offense in the NFL through the early portion of Mahomes' career. But that's where we are.The Chiefs' running back duo of Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt has posted a strong rushing-success rate due to their favorable running situations, but they've also combined for seven runs of 12 yards or more all season. That's out of 249 total rush attempts, by the way. Among the 43 players with 100 or more carries this season, they rank 40th (Pacheco) and 42nd (Hunt) in explosive run rate, according to Tru Media. That is a totally untenable situation, especially when teams are playing the Chiefs with copious amounts of light boxes and two-high safeties to encourage the run and take away the deep pass.\nThe Chiefs theoretically added a more explosive back when they selected Brashard Smith in last year's draft, but the sixth-round pick never carved out a real role in the offense and actually played less often down the stretch as the Chiefs faded from the playoff race -- despite the fact that the Chiefs clearly needed someone who could create big plays. Kansas City has tended to bring rookies along slowly and then grow their roles late in the year under the offensive-minded Reid, but that never materialized for Smith.If he's not going to be the answer (and a sixth-round pick being the answer would be pretty unlikely even if he didn't seemingly see his role vanish down the stretch of his debut campaign), the Chiefs need to make a real investment in the running back slot so that they're not in the same position next year that they have been for the last two. They need to be able to punish defenses for the way they choose to align against them, and they haven't been able to do that since Pacheco suffered his fractured leg last year.The pass catchers, though, also need to be better. Rashee Rice was coming back this season from a complicated knee injury and also suspended for the first six games, so perhaps with a full offseason program to get healthy and acclimated he can return to being the player he was prior to the 2024 injury. But he's also been a highly specialized player so far in his career, excelling on short passes and beating zone coverage while struggling against man. If he's going to be the team's No. 1 wideout, the Chiefs need to complement him with someone who can beat man coverage. They haven't really done that.\nXavier Worthy got going down the stretch of his rookie season in the same way that Rice did during his, but Rice was also out during the stretch that Worthy excelled, so Worthy was the one getting the short stuff and the designed touches. He didn't get those as often this season, partly because Rice was back and Worthy seemed to be playing through injuries ever since the third snap of the season when he ran into Kelce on a crossing route and injured his shoulder. He had the shoulder issue all year and also sustained multiple ankle injuries.Still, he's not someone who is equipped to beat tight man coverage given his slight stature, and he and Mahomes have struggled to generate chemistry on the deep passes that are supposed to stretch the field and provide extra space for Rice's underneath stuff. Kansas City's best deep-ball option has probably been Tyquan Thornton, but that's also basically all Thornton does. He, too, isn't much of a man beater except when he's running past his man. The Hollywood Brown experiment, meanwhile, just never worked out after he suffered an injury in his first preseason action prior to last season and then never got untracked this year. And JuJu Smith-Schuster's best skill these days is probably his blocking.The Chiefs probably need to invest in a more traditional X receiver who can beat man and win quickly on his routes. They need to find someone other than Worthy who can challenge defenses deep down the field but also do more than be an occasional deep shot guy like Thornton or Justin Watson in the past. They probably need to add a tight end or even two to complement Gray and Wiley or perhaps be a focal point of the offense like Kelce. And they desperately need to find someone who can run the ball more consistently and with more explosiveness than Hunt and/or Pacheco.\nNov 23, 2025; Kansas City, Missouri, USA; Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) and center Creed Humphrey (52) and quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) run onto the field before the game against the Indianapolis Colts at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-Imagn Images \n                                                                    Denny Medley\n                                                            The offensive lineWhile it seems like the offensive line is a major issue for the Chiefs due to how things have deteriorated in recent weeks, the reality of the situation is a little more complicated. No reasonable person could have expected that the Chiefs would lose their top four offensive tackles to injury and be playing guys like Esa Pole and Chukwuebuka Godrick in Week 15, for example. So, things are a little more settled than it might appear on the surface.Kansas City definitively has three of its five offensive line spots solidified. Creed Humphrey remains arguably the best center in the NFL. Trey Smith is one of the NFL's best guards, even if he didn't have his best year as he played through injury. Rookie Josh Simmons had a strong debut season at left tackle, particularly in pass protection. Those guys are solid.Kingsley Suamataia was far better this season at guard than he was when asked to play tackle as a rookie, and can probably be a solid-enough starter between Simmons and Humphrey. The major question is at right tackle where Jawaan Taylor has struggled with penalties and not been nearly as effective a player as the Chiefs thought he'd be when they signed him to a huge free-agent deal.\nThe Chiefs have Jaylon Moore to step into the lineup if they part ways with Taylor (which frankly seems pretty likely), but they could also prioritize getting a right tackle in the draft. Our own Mike Renner has them selecting Miami's Francis Mauigoa in Renner's most recent mock draft, for example, and Mauigoa could team with Smith to form a mauling duo on the line's right side. They could also draft a guard and kick Suamataia out to tackle or make him a backup.Either way, it seems like depth along the offensive line should be more of a priority than a total makeover.The salary capThe Chiefs are set to enter the offseason $43.8 million over the 2026 salary cap. They can get all the way under by restructuring or extending Mahomes' contract (which saves $44.4 million), which basically has to happen because he's set to have a $78.2 million cap hit for next season. Basically, the Chiefs built in a restructure or extension to happen in 2026, and it's going to happen, and then they can worry about doing everything else.\nAnd there are other cap-related decisions that need to be made. Taylor is set to count for $27.4 million on the books, but the Chiefs can save $20 million by cutting ties. They have Jaylon Moore on the roster to replace him at right tackle if they do, and it's not like Taylor has been playing at a level commensurate with his contract, so it wouldn't be surprising if they cut ties.Chris Jones is set to count for $44.9 million on the books and the Chiefs can save $22.5 million by restructuring or extending that deal. They can also save $12.5 million on Trey Smith's $24.3 million hit by restructuring that contract. Kansas City could also save around $10 million by extending Trent McDuffie off of his fifth-year option. If they make all three of those moves, they'd clear around $45 million in space. There are players like Michael Danna ($9 million), Drue Tranquill ($6 million) and Kristian Fulton ($5 million) whose releases could save a bunch of money as well. I'd consider Danna and Fulton far more likely to be gone than I would Tranquill, who still plays an important role.I'd be surprised if the Chiefs made all of those moves, but some combination of them should be enough to allow them to have a real offseason where they sign their draft class and a bunch of free agents to fill out the roster. That said, there are also various free agents whose statuses need to be determined: Kelce, Smith-Schuster, Hunt, Pacheco, Brown and Thornton are all set to be unrestricted free agents, as are Jaylen Watson, Bryan Cook, Charles Omenihu and Leo Chenal. Watson, Cook and Chenal, in particular, seem like important players to retain, while the running backs and receivers probably need to be replaced with players who can be more explosive, as mentioned earlier. And all of those decisions need to be made before the Chiefs wade into the free-agent market and prepare for the draft.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        USC quarterback Jayden Maiava will bypass the 2026 NFL Draft and instead return to school next season, the team announced Tuesday. The Trojans have \"re-signed\" several players in recent days, with Maiava and running back Waymond Jordan among the most important as the program looks ahead to Year 5 under coach Lincoln Riley. With the Alamo Bowl against TCU ahead, Maiava has had an impressive 2025 season, throwing for 3,431 yards and 23 touchdowns to just eight interceptions with six rushing touchdowns while providing stability at the position in his first year as the Trojans' full-time starter. \nMaiava began last season as the backup to Miller Moss before being inserted into the starting lineup for the final three games of the regular season and the Las Vegas Bowl win over Texas A&M. In the 35-31 bowl victory, Maiava impressed with 295 yards passing and four touchdowns.By starting Maiava and benching Moss -- who went on to transfer to Louisville -- Riley was taking a risk. If he didn't play the UNLV transfer down the stretch of the 2024 season, he ran the risk of Maiava walking away before he started in a single game. Riley's gamble paid off, and Maiava will enter next season as USC's undisputed starter -- and potentially one of the best quarterbacks in the country.\nUSC is set at quarterback entering 2026While USC can comfortably say Maiava is the undisputed starter heading into next season, his return logically takes the Trojans out of the transfer market for a starting-caliber quarterback. There have been multiple quarterbacks who have announced their intentions to enter the transfer portal, including Cincinnati's Brendan Sorsby and Florida's DJ Lagway. While Riley has used the transfer quarterback market to his advantage throughout his career (see Maiava, Caleb Williams, Jalen Hurts, etc.), it would be surprising to see the Trojans make a splash at that position this time around.\n        \n            \n                College football's transfer portal just hit dizzying speeds: What you need to know about big QB shakeup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPart of the reason is the presence of Husan Longstreet, USC's prized quarterback recruit from the 2025 cycle. Longstreet, rated a five-star prospect by 247Sports, appeared in four games this season and got extensive run during USC's opener against Missouri State, completing all nine of his pass attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown. Because he appeared in just four games, this will be a redshirt year for him. USC also signed four-star quarterback Jonas Williams in its 2026 class. \nHigh expectations for USC heading into 2026Maiava returning coupled with the fact that USC just finished with the No. 1 overall recruiting class in the 2026 cycle by 247Sports, the pressure is on Riley to produce results -- more specifically, a berth in the College Football Playoff. USC has never participated in the CFP since the four-team format was introduced back in 2014, but Riley was plucked away from Oklahoma to push the Trojans back into the top tier of the sport. So far, he has under-delivered with a 35-17 overall record across his four seasons. The Trojans won 11 games in Riley's first season at the helm before dropping to 8-5 in 2023 and 7-6 in 2024, USC's first year as a member of the Big Ten. With a win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30, Riley can secure his second 10-win season with USC.While Maiava will be back in the fold, USC will likely have to replace its top three pass catchers from this season as wide receiver Ja'Kobi Lane and tight end Lake McRee have already declared for the draft, while Makai Lemon -- this year's Biletnikoff Award recipient -- projects as a first-round pick. Looking ahead to next season, could Tanook Hines emerge as a go-to target? Hines, a freshman, has 28 catches for 398 yards and two touchdowns this season and should be in line for a larger role in 2026 as Maiava tries to boost his stock among a 2027 NFL Draft crop that is projecting to be full of star power.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a notion that players turn up their level of play when under the bright lights of a primetime game, which is something you could apply to your Week 16 Fantasy football strategy. The likes of Jayden Reed, Caleb Williams, Rhamondre Stevenson, Brock Purdy and Alec Pierce may have initially been on the bubble for your Week 16 Fantasy football lineups, but them playing on primetime may add extra appeal this week. Seeing how we're in the midst of the 2025 Fantasy football playoffs, any extra insight could be useful when making Fantasy start/sit decisions.Bryce Young doesn't have a primetime game, but he does have a divisional matchup versus Tampa. Young has looked like a Heisman-winning, No. 1 overall pick versus the Bucs with 250.5 passing yards, four total touchdowns and no turnovers over his last two versus Tampa Bay. So, in addition to looking at players in primetime games, some helpful Week 16 Fantasy football advice would be to also notice how players have performed previously versus upcoming opponents. Before making your Week 16 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 16 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 16 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 16 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 16: The model is fading Giants receiver Wan'Dale Robinson, despite him averaging 81.3 yards with two scores over his last three games, and being the WR9 in PPR leagues on the season. Robinson has a brutal Sunday matchup versus Minnesota, which has allowed the fewest Fantasy points to opposing wide receivers this season. No wideout has scored in six straight games versus Minnesota, as it's kept the likes of CeeDee Lamb, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Terry McLaurin out of the endzone. Also, Robinson's Fantasy production is heavily reliant on him racking up lots of catches, but only one team has given up fewer receptions to wideouts than the Vikings. He sits outside the top 30 in positional Week 16 Fantasy football rankings so is one to bypass this week.Another curveball: The model is high on Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, despite him having one or fewer passing TDs in four of his last five games and being started in just 43% of leagues this week. The one outlier during this five-game stretch came on Sunday, when Nix tied a career-high with four touchdowns, along with 302 passing yards, versus an elite Green Bay defense. That caliber of defense won't be what he sees on Sunday with the Jags, who rank No. 20 versus the pass. Additionally, Nix, who has 254 yards and four scores on the ground this year, should find success with his legs against Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed 20+ rushing yards or a rushing TD to quarterbacks in five of their last six games as Nix is a top-10 Fantasy QB this week.

Metcalf. This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. See the model's entire Week 16 Fantasy football rankings for PPR and standard leagues here.So who should you start and sit this week, and which surprising wide receiver could lead you to victory? Visit SportsLine now to get Week 16 Fantasy football rankings for every position, plus see which wideout is going to come out of nowhere to crack the top 15 all from the model that has outperformed experts big-time.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys' 34-26 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on \"Sunday Night Football\" -- all but ending their long-shot purs",
    "body": "\n        ARLINGTON, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys' 34-26 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on \"Sunday Night Football\" -- all but ending their long-shot pursuit for a playoff berth -- showed how much more Dallas needs out of its defensive coordinator position. Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores' unit has a clear, effective identity: it's aggressive, and is going to blitz a lot. Minnesota blitzes on 49% of opponent dropbacks, the highest rate in the NFL, and Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott and the Cowboys were well aware of that. That didn't matter with Prescott being pressured on a season-high 45% of his dropbacks in losing effort in which he completed 23 of his 38 passes for 294 yards. Dallas knew what was coming from Flores, and the Cowboys' offensive line and quarterback couldn't handle it. All Prescott could do postgame was tip his hat. \"The frustration comes from honestly just not having a good enough plan to beat that Cover Zero [blitz] and seeing something over and over like that and not being able to gash it,\" Prescott said postgame. \"I'm frustrated for myself and I didn't have an answer for it.\" Contrast that to how Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus' unit dealt with Vikings struggling second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy. The 2024 NFL Draft's 10th overall pick entered Week 15 ranking last in the NFL in completion percentage (56%), TD-to-INT ratio (9-10) and passer rating (67.4) this season among 34 qualified quarterbacks. McCarthy didn't have much of a problem with Eberflus' zone coverage scheme, throwing for a career-high 250 yards, two touchdowns and an interception on 15 of 24 passing while also adding a 1-yard rushing touchdown.   \n\"I want to say that we let their quarterback have an outstanding game, and I thought we could do more about that rather than to let him [have his way],\" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said postgame. \"I think that's pretty telling that when he has the kind of game that he had that we weren't able to really mitigate that.\"What's even more telling is Eberflus opting not to be more aggressive against McCarthy despite getting results doing so and instead dropping into his patented zone coverage looks to keep everything in front of his defense. When he went outside of his tendency and blitzed six times, including just once in the second half, McCarthy struggled. He threw for 41 yards, one touchdown and one interception for 72.2 passer rating when Dallas blitzed on Sunday night. When Eberflus didn't blitz, McCarthy thrived, throwing for 209 yards and a touchdown on 12 of 18 passing for a 124.5 passer rating. The Vikings also converted all three of their fourth downs that they decided to keep the offense on the field into first downs with McCarthy facing pressure on his dropbacks at the third-lowest rate of his career (34.6%). That's glaring mismanagement from Eberflus. J.J. McCarthy vs. Cowboys defense, blitzed vs. not blitzedBlitzedNot BlitzedCompletions-Pass Attempts3-612-18Pass Yards41209Pass Yards/Attempt6.811.6TD-INT1-11-0Passer Rating72.2124.5The boost Eberflus' unit received from the trade deadline moves to acquire All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and veteran linebacker Logan Wilson in tandem with a return to health for both linebacker DeMarvion Overshown and third-round rookie cornerback Shavon Revel Jr. has faded away. Williams' presence did fix the run defense, but the pass rush and pass coverage is struggling just as it did before. Yes, the Cowboys have personnel needs at edge rusher, linebacker and cornerback. Eberflus attempting to shoehorn a square peg into a round hole in pass coverage has only exacerbated some of the issues that have led to Dallas allowing 30.0 points per game, the second-most in the NFL. During Dallas' defensive glory years of the 2020s (2021-23 under now-Commanders coach Dan Quinn) when they went 12-5 for three straight seasons, the Cowboys ran man coverage at the third-highest rate in the NFL at 33.8%, per TruMedia.  This season, Dallas now runs zone coverage at the 10th-highest rate in the NFL (75.3%) and man coverage at the 10th-lowest rate in the NFL (17.3%) this season, according to TruMedia. As a result, the Cowboys are allowing 254.8 passing yards per game in 2025, the most in the league.\"It could be the change of defensive coordinators. That's hard to deal with just changing plays, changing personnel, finding what fits. Finding what scheme fits your players that you have and just trying to find a balance to you could run with,\" cornerback Trevon Diggs said postgame. \"I think that we made some great additions like with the interior [defensive line] adding Quinnen [Williams] and Kenny Clark. That was good. I feel like it's headed into the right direction.\"  Cowboys With/Without DT Quinnen Williams This Season, NFL RanksWithout (Weeks 1-9)With (Weeks 11-15)W-L3-5-1 (19th)3-2  (T-13th)PPG allowed30.8  (31st)28.6 (T-26th)Total YPG allowed397.4  (31st)334.4 (18th)Rush YPG allowed143.0  (29th)79.0 (2nd)QB pressures135 (3rd)76 (7th)QB pressure rate39.8% (9th)39.4% (9th)Sacks20 (T-17th)9 (T-17th)Takeaways7 (T-23rd)4 (T-20th)* On bye week in Week 10Dallas first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer calls the offensive plays, and his unit is averaging 29.1 points per game, the fourth-best mark in the NFL. The defense is the problem, and that unit is a driving reason in the Cowboys being 6-7-1 with 1% to reach the postseason according to CBS' SportsLine model. The only way into the playoffs is for the Cowboys to win out and pray the Philadelphia Eagles lose out across the last three weeks of the year. That's highly unlikely to happen with the Eagles facing the 4-10 Washington Commanders twice to end the year. \"We certainly didn't think we'd be here in this kind of shape with three games to go and have to be behind the eight ball the way we are. It's very disappointing,\" Jones said. \"I'm obviously very disappointed for our fans. I'm disappointed for these players. I didn't expect that.\"That disappointment has Jones somewhat evaluating Eberflus' job status for future seasons across Dallas' defensive performance in the last three games of the season against the 10-4 Los Angeles Chargers, the 4-10 Washington Commanders and the 2-12 New York Giants. If Eberflus can't or won't adapt his ways to the Cowboys' personnel, Jones could be in the market for a defensive coordinator who will in 2026. \"The adjustments that we should be making should be with this year, these next three games in mind,\" Jones said. ... \"With three games left and the short time we've got to play them in, then that will impact any adjustments that you make regarding coaching and the time frame you do it in. That's a legit question for sure.\"  Other burning questionsWith the Cowboys headed for their second year in a row watching the playoffs on the couch, here are four other burning questions to think about as Dallas heads into the offseason. Will Trevon Diggs be a Cowboy 2026?The writing may be on the wall for Diggs and Dallas heading toward a divorce. The 2021 NFL interceptions leader remained on injured reserve this week despite feeling like he and his knee have been healthy for the last two weeks. If the Cowboys don't activate him by Dec. 20 at 4 p.m., the day before the Cowboys' Week 16 home finale against the Los Angeles Chargers, Diggs' 2025 season is over. Dallas' 2025 season essentially already is with their playoff chances down to 1% according to CBS' SportsLine model. \"I hope I can play. I hope they decide I can play. I feel good enough to play, so we'll just have to see,\" Diggs said. \"It's not my decision. Me personally, I feel good. I feel healthy. I feel ready, so I just have to wait. ... I feel like I can make a big difference. I feel like I can contribute. I feel like I can help this team win.\"  Jerry Jones disagrees. \"Diggs isn't healthy enough to be out there for us. Period,\" Jones said postgame. \"You have to look at practices and if they practice good enough. Whether it's a limitation they've had in recent games or a long-term injury, you've got to make your mind up when you see him practice. When we looked at practice, we didn't like what we saw relative to his health and ability to make plays.\"  Jones also dodged a question about if he sees Diggs finishing out his five-year, $97 million contract. He referenced the 27-year-old's 29 games missed since 2023, so the cloud around Diggs' future remains, which speaks volumes. Dallas would save around $12.6 million in cap room if he is released before June 1 in 2026. A post-June 1 cut would open up $15.5 million. Diggs' $19.4 million average per year salary is tied for the 10th-highest at the cornerback position, per OverTheCap.com.  \"I don't have to look at that right now. We of course are very disappointed that he hadn't had more play time this year,\" Jones said. \"Frankly, I'm disappointed that he hadn't had play time over the last several years, and his injuries have a lot to do with that.\"  How will Dallas handle George Pickens' future?Wide receiver George Pickens has been everything the Cowboys could have hoped for when trading a 2026 third-round pick plus 2027 fifth-round pick in exchange for the 24-year-old and a 2027 sixth-round draft choice from the Pittsburgh Steelers this past offseason. He's produced like an All-Pro-caliber player in nearly every key receiving metric, and Pickens set the new record for most receiving yards in a player's first season with the Cowboys with 1,212 yards receiving and counting through 15 weeks. That record was previously held by Pro Football Hall of Famer Terrell Owens with 1,180 yards receiving back in 2006. \nGeorge Pickens this season, NFL ranksNFL rankCatches818thReceiving yards1,2123rdReceiving TD87thReceiving first downs643rdCatches of 25-plus yards11T-5thPickens' rookie deal expires at the conclusion of the season, and Dallas will certainly look to retain him. The how is always complicated with Jerry Jones. Fresh off the best year of his career, Pickens will certainly be in line for around at least $30 million in average per year salary on a multi-year deal. The Cowboys will likely franchise tag him in the hopes of coming to terms on a long-term extension this summer. What is Terence Steele's path forward in Dallas? Dallas' 28-year-old right tackle remains one of the better run-blocking offensive tackles in the NFL with Pro Football Focus grading Steele as No. 17 with a 77.6 PFF run-blocking grade. However, TruMedia tags him as surrendering 40 quarterback pressures in pass protections this season, the most in the entire league. He hasn't exhibited the same lateral movement in pass protection since returning from a torn ACL and MCL he suffered late in the 2022 season. According to OverTheCap.com, Dallas would save $8.75 million if they released him before June 1, and they would save $14 million if they designated him as a post-June 1 cut. The Cowboys are going to have to get creative with their cap management after adding Clark and Williams.How aggressive will Jerry Jones be in free agency entering 2026 down some draft picks? Jones loves to operate as a draft and develop organization, leaning on cheaper, more controllable talent to build out his roster. Yes the Cowboys do have an extra first-round pick this season because of the Micah Parsons trade. However, their second-round pick belongs to the New York Jets (Williams trade) and their third-round pick belongs to the Pittsburgh Steelers (Pickens trade). Jones will need to get aggressive in free agency to find more defensive depth at edge rusher, linebacker, cornerback and potentially safety. Basically every level of the defense. The Cowboys spent an NFL-low $20.47 million in free agency in 2024, per OverTheCap.com, and they went bargain bin shopping in 2025. They struck oil with running back Javonte Williams, but most of their additions didn't move the needle. Dallas needs more from its front office in free agency in order to build a more competent defense in 2026. \n            ",

So, I'm not complaining or criticizing. But it is interesting that the Blue Devils have largely been omitted from the No. 1 conversation even though they're A) Duke, B) 10-0 with wins over Michigan State, Florida, Kansas and Arkansas, C) led by the best player in the sport (Cameron Boozer), and D) No. 1 at MasseyRatings.com.\n        \n            \n                Trotter's Trends: Ohio State's Bruce Thornton stands alone, Kentucky's new plan and vital role players\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDuke did get first-place votes in this week's AP poll from Chris Lea, Percy Allen and Seth Davis -- but that amounts to just 4.9% of all first-place votes. Again, I'm not complaining or criticizing. Duke is No. 3 in Tuesday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings; that's the same place Jon Scheyer's team is in the AP poll. I just think that if we would've known on the opening day of the season that Duke would start 10-0 with four wins over preseason Top 25 teams, and be led by a freshman who is running away with the national player of the year race, most of us would've assumed the Blue Devils would be ranked No. 1 heading into Tuesday night's game with Lipscomb. -- but they're not, which is probably just a testament to the similarly impressive and undefeated starts Michigan and Arizona have also provided.\nEither way, there are now seven undefeated teams remaining in college basketball -- Michigan, Arizona, Duke, Iowa State, Nebraska, Vanderbilt and ...

    "body": "\n        Golden State Valkyries guard Veronica Burton, the 2025 WNBA Most Improved Player and All-Defensive Second Team honoree, did not come out of nowhere. She was a three-time Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, WBCA Defensive Player of the Year and an AP All-American at Northwestern, and was the No. 7 overall pick in the 2022 draft. So why were the Valkyries her third team in four years? Blame, in part, the WNBA's small roster sizes and lack of developmental pathways. During her first two seasons with the Dallas Wings, Burton was stuck behind veterans on a playoff team and received limited minutes -- during which she showed flashes, but was inconsistent. Ahead of the 2024 season, Burton was one of the Wings' final cuts as the front office cleared room for five incoming rookies, including three top-five picks. She later caught on with the Connecticut Sun, and spent one season there before the Valkyries stole her in the expansion draft and gave her an opportunity to start full time last season. While it's easy to criticize the Wings' decision to let go of Burton in retrospect, they were doing what every WNBA team has always done with young players who aren't immediately productive: move them out for the new wave of rookies. \nWNBA teams can have a maximum of 12 players on their roster, but many only carry 11 due to salary cap constraints. There is no G League nor two-way contract equivalent (like there is in the NBA), practice time is limited once games begin and the season, even now that it has been extended, is only 44 games. During the offseason, many players head overseas or to other domestic leagues where they often play a different role in a different system. Beyond the logistical challenges of developing players, 75% of the league has made the playoffs for the majority of the WNBA's history, which puts nearly every franchise in win-now mode. If you can't help a team win right away, your odds of sticking around long enough to change that are low, and your odds of doing so for the team that drafted you are even worse. From 2020-2024, there were 120 players selected in the first and second rounds of the draft. (The 2025 draft was not included because it is too recent.) Only 50 remain in the league (41.6%) and only 23 remain on the team that drafted them (19.2%). \nIf you break the numbers down even further, there's a wide gulf between lottery and non-lottery picks, as well as first- and second-round picks. Of the 20 lottery selections between 2020-2024, 15 remain in the league (75%) and 10 remain with the team that drafted them (50%)Of the 40 non-lottery first-round picks, 22 remain in the league (55%) and eight remain on the team that drafted them (20%)Of the 60 second-round picks, 13 remain in the league (21.6%) and six remain on the team that drafted them (10%)Here's a look at the year-by-year breakdown:*Note: \"Remain in the league\" is defined as having played a game in the 2025 season or opted to sit out2020 WNBA DraftDraft roundPlayed in WNBAStill in WNBAWith original teamFirst12/124/121/12Second12/123/121/12Players still in the WNBA: Sabrina Ionescu, Satou Sabally, Tyasha Harris, Kitija Laksa, Luisa Geiselsoder, Leonie Fiebich, Kaila CharlesPlayer still with their original team: Ionescu (New York Liberty), Geiselsoder (Wings)2021 WNBA DraftDraft roundPlayed in WNBAStill in WNBAWith original teamFirst12/124/121/12Second7/123/120/12Players still in the WNBA: Awak Kuier, Aari McDonald, Michaela Onyenwere, Iliana Rupert, Dana Evans, Natasha Mack, DiJonai CarringtonPlayer still with their original team: Kuier (Wings)2022 WNBA DraftDraft roundPlayed in WNBAStill in WNBAWith original teamFirst11/129/126/12Second10/123/122/12Players still in the WNBA: Rhyne Howard, NaLyssa Smith, Shakira Austin, Emily Engstler, Nyara Sabally, Lexie Hull, Veronica Burton, Rae Burrell, Kierstan Bell, Christyn Williams, Naz Hillmon, Olivia Nelson-OdodaPlayer still with their original team: Howard (Atlanta Dream), Austin (Washington Mystics), Sabally (Liberty), Hull (Indiana Fever), Burrell (Los Angeles Sparks), Bell (Las Vegas Aces), Hillmon (Dream), Nelson-Ododa (Sun)2023 WNBA DraftDraft roundPlayed in WNBAStill in WNBAWith original teamFirst11/129/124/12Second7/121/121/12Players still in the WNBA: Aliyah Boston, Diamond Miller, Maddy Siegrist, Lou Lopez Senechal, Haley Jones, Grace Berger, Laeticia Amihere, Jordan Horston, Zia Cooke, Dorka JuhaszPlayer still with their original team: Boston (Fever), Siegrist (Wings), Senechal (Wings), Horston (Seattle Storm), Juhasz (Minnesota Lynx)2024 WNBA DraftDraft roundPlayed in WNBAStill in WNBAWith original teamFirst11/1211/126/12Second6/123/121/12Players still in the WNBA: Caitlin Clark, Cameron Brink, Kamilla Cardoso, Rickea Jackson, Jacy Sheldon, Aaliyah Edwards, Angel Reese, Alissa Pili, Carla Leite, Leila Lacan, Marquesha Davis, Nika Muhl, Kate Martin, Elizabeth KitleyPlayer still with their original team: Clark (Fever), Brink (Sparks), Cardoso (Sky), Jackson (Sparks), Reese (Sky), Lacan (Sun), Muhl (Storm)Changes on the way?In Burton's case, her breakout likely would not have been possible if she didn't hang around the league after being waived by the Wings. How many other Burtons may have slipped through the cracks over the years because they got waived once and never got another chance?That brings us to an interesting note in Ben Pickman's report at The Athletic about the most recent collective bargaining agreement proposal from the Women's National Basketball Players Association:The WNBPA has proposed mandating teams carry 12 players at all times. Each team currently can carry a maximum of 12 players and a minimum of 11.The WNBPA is also proposing that teams be allowed to sign up to two additional developmental players, who would receive a stipend and could appear in up to 10 games per season at a prorated minimum league salary, before signing a rest-of-season contract. Developmental players would also receive full benefits.Mandating that teams roster 12 players and creating two developmental roster spots per team would obviously benefit players. It would ensure that every roster spot is filled, and offer players on the cusp of making a roster the ability to remain around the team. In-season development would still be a challenge, but creating a developmental pool would force teams to make it more of a priority. And even if said developmental players didn't end up earning a rest-of-season contract, or even seeing much game time, they would have a chance to work on their craft in a WNBA environment and form relationships with coaches that may pay off down the line. \"With the developmental part, you get the chance to grow with each other,\" Kelsey Mitchell said Monday during Unrivaled's media day. \"I think if you want to develop who you want on your team and mold them to who you want them to be, I think it's a great recipe to have for basketball across the board.\"This change would also benefit teams, even if it may complicate their salary cap sheets. The cost to keep two developmental players around on stipends would be minimal, and would allow teams to keep players who just missed out on a final roster spot in their system. Often, teams select more players in the draft than they have open roster spots for, which is a major reason why the third round, in particular, feels like a waste of everyone's time. With these developmental slots, second- and third-round picks would become more valuable and give teams a real path to finding, and keeping, young talent. An answer to injury issues?Injuries and the schedule were a major talking point during the 2025 season, which saw each team play 44 games for the first time in league history. Numerous high-profile players, including Caitlin Clark, Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier, spent extended spells on the sidelines, and players regularly criticized commissioner Cathy Engelbert over the amount of games and lack of time off. Few teams felt the pain as badly as the Fever, who lost Clark, Sophie Cunningham, Sydney Colson, Aari McDonald and Chloe Bibby to season-ending injuries in the regular season, then saw Damiris Dantas and Kelsey Mitchell go down in the playoffs. The Fever regularly had to apply for hardship exemptions and had 18 different players appear in a game. It's no surprise that Mitchell is in favor of adding developmental slots. \"I think it's effective. I think anything you do that can sustain us being who we need to be without overcompensating so much,\" Mitchell said. \"If you have a developmental league, I think the players that are on the team already won't have as much to worry about as far as everything that comes with losing certain people on your team.\"Monique Billings, who also spoke at Unrivaled media day on Monday, concurred. \"It's something you see in the W often -- not having enough bodies and players, coming down to seven, eight, maybe nine people and having to thug it out. It's not always easy,\" Billings said. \"I think a development pool would be phenomenal and something that our league has never seen before. I think it would be a big help for sure.\"Teams having access to two developmental players would not solve all of the league's injury issues -- which will not subside any time soon -- but it would help teams navigate periods of poor health. In the event of multiple injuries, teams could call up their developmental players instead of going through the hassle of signing players off the street to seven-day contracts. Will a player development pool come to pass?Creating a developmental pool would be beneficial to both players and teams on multiple fronts: player development and health and safety. It is fair to wonder how much the stipend would pay players, but the only apparent downside is the (relatively minor) cost associated with having more players on the books. Historically, though, the WNBA and its teams have not always been willing (or able) to put up the money to make seemingly obvious improvements to further professionalize the league. Even now, players are still fighting for teams to improve their facilities and hire more security personnel. The league is not going to willingly assume the cost of adding more than two dozen players to the books -- even on stipends, rather than a salary -- without extracting something from the WNBPA in these negotiations. Which means, how badly do the players want a developmental pool, and what are they willing to part with on their end to make it happen? For example, the league might agree to a developmental pool in exchange for smaller salary increases for current players. If the players make a developmental pool a central tenet of their demands, it does seem realistic. If not, forget about it. After all, this proposal isn't coming from the league. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Recent injuries to Dereck Lively II and Zach Edey may not stand out as especially newsworthy to the casual NBA fan. But to draft enthusiasts and those who study roster trends, the injuries to Lively and Edey (7-foot-1 and 7-foot-3, respectively) are indicative of a concerning recent trend related to the durability, or lack thereof, of young big men.  There were two centers picked in the first round of the 2023 NBA Draft: Victor Wembanyama at No. 1 and Lively at No. 12. As rookies they played 71 and 55 games, respectively. Last year, those numbers dipped to 46 and 36. This year, they are on track to dip again. Wemby just returned from a calf injury, and now has played 13 of 25 games this season. Lively played just seven times before it was announced he would miss the rest of the season after foot surgery.The 2024 draft had better big man depth up front. Alex Sarr (2nd overall), Donovan Clingan (7th), and Edey (9th) were lottery picks. Kel'el Ware (15th), Yves Missi (21st), and DaRon Holmes (22nd) went in the first round. Of those six, only Missi played in more than 67 games as a rookie, while Holmes missed the entire season.In total, those eight first-round draft picks have played in 655 of a possible 1012 regular season games since they were drafted. That's an average of 65% -- or roughly 53 regular-season games per year.\nNow, of course, some of this is contextual, but we can acknowledge that there could be a pattern forming. With six of those 8 players already slotted as starters, there are possible implications not just for those teams, but maybe even for the league as a whole in terms of how they go about assessing potential durability during the draft process.To better explore the issue, we spoke to three anonymous NBA scouts.Why are players, and especially big men, getting hurt more frequently?Last month, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr spoke about the correlation between pace of play and the increase of injuries, saying the Warriors medical staff \"believes that the wear and tear, the speed, the pace, the mileage is factoring into these injuries.\"The burden on big men could be even more daunting, according to league sources. \"We are asking these players with such size, mass, and length to cover more ground and complete more strenuous activities,\" one source said. \"They have to guard and switch on the perimeter and make plays out of ball-screens, which causes much more downhill momentum than just sitting in the post. Throw is the level of athlete, physicality, and pace and there's more tread on their tires as the year progresses.\"\nThat logic seems virtually universal at this point. As Kerr said back in November, \"everyone understands it's easier to score if you beat the opponent down the floor, get out in transition. But when everybody's doing that, the games are much higher-paced. Everyone has to cover out to 25 feet because everybody can shoot 3s.\"If big men in the league are being asked to do more than ever before, that makes durability more important than ever before, and the processes by which some organizations assess that can differ.How do franchises assess risk factors in the pre-draft process?There is a certain baseline that virtually all 30 teams subscribe to. They're all interested in past injuries, procedures or surgeries and lingering issues. It is also standard for draft workouts to include medical exams with team doctors and medical staff.\nBeyond that though, there can be some real variance in the way teams approach this topic in the pre-draft process.\"Every team is different on how deep they dive into injury potential and how risk-averse they are,\" one scout told CBS Sports. \"Like everything else, ultimately teams are going to bet on if the talent outweighs the risk.\"Some teams prefer to leave it up to their medical staff. \"They give us green, yellow or red flags, and if it's yellow, they'll outline what the concerns are. But at the end of the day, we have to make our own judgement.\"\nOthers try to rely on the intel gathering that is part of their scouting process to better illuminate the \"recommendations\" of the medical team. \"Have they missed games? Have they missed practices? How far back do we know that history? Is there a history of injuries in the family background? If he's missed things, is it a real injury or is there a low threshold for pain? Further, does he take care of his body? Is he doing the proper work in the training room and taking advantage of every opportunity?\"Another variable that defers per organization is the level of cohesiveness and trust that exists between the front office and the medical team. \"Having a great medical staff, that you trust, is a huge factor in the draft process, especially when you get guys in the building.\" For the best front offices, that aspire to win the margins in every area across the organization, the medical team is just another such category.What's interesting, though, is that while the front office, and ultimately the GM (or head of basketball operations), is dependent on the medical team's recommendations to make the best decisions possible, the amount of control a GM has over his medical team can vary by organization. While there are some executives that have the authority to make any changes they want, when asked if any GM could replace members of his medical team or go out and recruit more qualified ones, one scout answered, \"I don't see that happening [everywhere].\"\nBeyond the organizational differences in process, the way in which the final decision is executed can also vary by team. \"Some owners want final say, and it is incumbent on the front office to sell their vision.\" Others, let the final draft day decisions be made by the head of the front office, but even then, personal context is important. The more job security the GM has, the more latitude he has to take chances. \"For some GMs, if the wrong guy gets injured, it could be a reason why they get fired. The more secure GMs can say 'F it, let's do it.'\"Of course, those more secure GMs are probably the same ones who have the freedom to build the best medical teams, the most thorough scouting intel, and the best practices of organizational collaboration and growth.What's next for Lively and the Mavs?In the wake of Nico Harrison's departure, the Mavericks don't have a long-term solution about who is running their front office, and apparently won't have one until the offseason. Michael Finley and Matt Riccardi are being called Interim Co-General Managers until then. Simultaneously, now minority owner Mark Cuban is getting input again, while there is speculation that head coach Jason Kidd could also be in consideration for the GM job. In other words, there are way too many cooks in the kitchen, and the person with ultimately authority -- majority owner Patrick Dumont -- hasn't shown the basketball knowledge or context to make these strategic decisions.\nThe lack of organizational leadership or hierarchy comes at a critical time for shaping the future of the franchise. With Harrison's vision of building a title contender around Davis and Kyrie Irving now rarely viewed as than more than the butt of a bad joke, expediting the rebuilding process around Cooper Flagg should be the top priority.The challenge with that though is that outside of this upcoming 2026 draft, the Mavs don't control their own first-round pick again until 2031. The 2027 pick goes to Charlotte if it's not in the top two. OKC has a right to swap in 2028. Houston has the right to swap in 2029 (although Dallas owns an unprotected first from the Lakers), and San Antonio or Minnesota may have swap rights in 2030. In other words, the Mavs are incentivized to lose now, which is why there is speculation around potential deals for Anthony Davis.\n        \n            \n                Ultimate NBA trade guide: 100 candidates who could move as basketball trade season unofficially begins\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFurther complicating matters is that Lively, who is now out for the season, is eligible for an extension this summer. If not, he's headed toward restricted free agency in the summer of 2027. Two years ago, the idea of not extending Lively would have been almost inconceivable as the rookie played a key role in the Mavs run to the NBA Finals while blocking shots, being all over the offensive glass, exceptionally efficient at the rim, and a great lob partner for Luka Dončić. Now, his archetype could still be hugely valuable alongside Flagg, especially because of their shared Duke lineage and that Lively is viewed as such a great culture guy. The present reality though is his future is just as unclear as who will have ultimate decision-making authority from the front office.\nWhat's next for Edey and the Grizzlies?Let's face it, Dallas and Memphis have more in common that just young, injured big men. They have franchises that are in a state of flux, albeit for different reasons. While Grizzlies' GM Zach Kleiman is viewed in a vastly different light than Harrison was across the league, he is facing a snowballing number of challenges, which mostly stem from the status of Ja Morant.Morant just returned from a calf injury that kept him out for almost a month. Before that, his productivity was the lowest it had been since his rookie season, his lack of effort glaring enough that it was called out on an Amazon Prime broadcast, and his public comments about the current coaching staff only making matters worse. Combine that with some off-the-court issues, and Morant's days in Memphis now seem numbered, but moving on from their point guard means essentially a complete course correction for the franchise. We saw the first evidence of that with this summer's Desmond Bane deal, but trading Morant would mark an undeniable new path that could spur additional roster decisions.The silver lining for the Grizzlies is that they've aced the last two drafts, and thus already starting acquiring young assets, of which Edey is clearly one. The former Purdue big man's transition to the NBA has been far easier than most anticipated, when he's healthy. In that same 2024 draft, they came up with two second round steals, selecting Jaylen Wells at 39 and trading for the rights to Cam Spencer at 53. Wells was named NBA All-Rookie First Team last year and most recently has averaged 18 points per game over his last eight. Spencer is averaging 11 points and 4 assists through 25 games this season while posting 48/45/94 shooting splits. It was more of the same in the most recent draft, as they took Cedric Coward at 11, who already looks like a long-term building block after putting up 14 points, 6 boards, and 3 assists through his first 25 NBA games.\nFor Edey in particular, durability has always been a talking point because of his sheer size, even by NBA standards. His most recent setback, which his agent, Mark Bartelstein, described as \"a management plan to optimize Zach's long-term health in consultation with the Grizzlies and medical experts,\" doesn't appear to change any of that. Bartelstein added that, \"Following this step, the short, and long-term, prognosis for Zach is excellent.\" The reality though is that Memphis is smart enough to know that drafting Edey would require extra layers of medical care over the years. Simultaneously, it would also dictate some roster and style of play considerations as even the best version of Edey isn't going to be better suited in specific defensive coverages and schemes.Again, none of that has changed, but has changed is the conversation about his ultimate ceiling in the league, given how dominant he's been in spurts. Ironically, it's that accelerated growth, along with that of Coward, Wells, and Spencer, which may actually make it that much easier to turn the page on the next iteration of the Grizzlies, however different that may end up being. \n            ",

We're still yet to see some things settled, though, such as free agents Framber Valdez, Eugenio Suárez and Zac Gallen finding homes (free agent tracker here) and there's always the possibility another trade or two will happen as well. Let's gather the news and rumors on this Monday.Giants ink Bader to two-year dealThe Giants and free agent outfielder Harrison Bader have agreed to a two-year contract, per The Athletic. The deal is for $20.5 million with the possibility that incentives could get it to $21 million, according to the New York Post.Bader, 31, played in 146 games for the Twins (96 games) and Phillies (50) last season, hitting .277/.347/.449 (117 OPS+) with 24 doubles, 17 homers, 54 RBI, 61 runs, 11 steals and 3.9 WAR. He still rates out as an excellent defensive center fielder -- which comes in handy in the spacious Oracle Park -- and he hit for good average and OPS last season, too. \nGiven the landscape of the Giants' roster, Bader probably steps right in as the everyday center fielder, bumping Jung Hoo Lee to right field. Lee's range in center was a big problem last season, so this alignment should give the Giants much better outfield coverage.Minor-league deals for former MLB namesThe Angels have agreed to a minor-league deal with Trey Mancini (The Athletic). He last played in the majors in 2023.The Cubs have signed outfielder Dylan Carlson to a minor-league deal (The Baseball Tribune).\n            \n    ",

Their offensive line was among the best in football and their defensive front was headlined by a pair of game-wrecking pass rushers in Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor. One of the major questions for the Hurricanes coming into the 2026 season will be whether they can remain as dominant up front after some key departures to the NFL. Both Bain and Mesidor are headed off to the NFL, while the offensive line loses star tackle Francis Mauigoa, but if any Canes fans are looking for optimism, Bain provided it in a recent interview with CBS Miami. When asked about how he thinks the Hurricanes' defensive line will fare without his presence (and Mesidor's), Bain proclaimed that he wouldn't be surprised if that group is even better in 2026. \"I feel like they might be better than this year, because they got to see me and Akeem lead em off and show em what it's supposed to look like,\" Bain said. \"Now they got that extra chip on their shoulder from getting all the way to the dance and not finishing like we wanted to. So now they get some extra fuel, some extra drive to go in next year with the right mindset and get the job done.\" \nBain pointed to the depth of the group as one of the reasons he thinks Miami will be right back in the Playoff next year trying to win a national title, noting that the only departures are himself, Mesidor and David Blay. The challenge is, those are three of their four most productive defensive lineman -- star defensive tackle Ahmad Moten staying for 2026 was a huge coup for Mario Cristobal's group.Mesidor and Bain combined for 22 of the Hurricanes' 50 sacks as a team this year, and while they return some key players like Moten and linebacker Mohamed Toure, it'll be difficult to fill those shoes on the edge. Jason Taylor has done an unbelievable job as their defensive line coach, helping Bain and Mesidor become first round talents, and now he'll look to develop the next star pass rushers at Miami. \nWhile those of us outside Miami's facility may be a bit skeptical they can simply replace that kind of talent, Bain certainly is a believer in his now-former teammates to pick up the torch and keep Miami in the title conversation. If he's right about the defensive line being somehow better than this year's special group, the Hurricanes ought to be at the top of the ACC and back in the Playoff again. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        This women's college basketball season has taken us on a roller coaster ride with multiple upsets and some unexpected programs stealing the spotlight. For example, it wasn't a surprise that UConn was still undefeated in mid January, but nobody saw Vanderbilt and Texas Tech joining them. Meanwhile, the Freshman of the Year race originally started out as a question of USC's Jazzy Davidson or Oklahoma's Aaliyah Chavez. Those two are still the frontrunners, but Gonzaga has a freshman with some eye-popping stats.As for Iowa, the Hawkeyes are thriving in Jan Jensen's second season at the helm of the program. Here is a closer look at the biggest surprises of the 2025-26 season so far.IowaWhen Caitlin Clark left for the WNBA and Lisa Bluder retired in 2024, the Hawkeyes didn't exactly fall off the map, but they were not at the same level they were when they reached back-to-back national championships. Last year, Iowa, led by Lucy Olsen, was unranked for the latter half of the season and lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Since the Hawkeyes only had Olsen for one year, they had to readjust in the offseason.\nThe result? Iowa is up to No. 8 in the AP Poll and riding an eight-game winning streak that includes four victories over ranked opponents. Let's not forget this is only Jan Jensen's second year at the helm of the program. The Hawkeyes' 91-70 victory over Ohio State on Sunday was their third consecutive regular season win against a ranked opponent, which is a first in program history. Their 9-0 start in the Big Ten is also their best league start since the 1995-96 season, when the Hawkeyes began conference play 12-0.A key part of this success has been sophomore Ava Heiden, who entered the starting lineup this season and became the leader of the team. Her growth has been so impressive that she earned a vote for Most Improved Player in the CBS Sports midseason awards.\nGonzaga's Lauren WhittakerThe Freshman of the Year race has been a lot closer than it seems. While Oklahoma's Aaliyah Chavez was the unanimous pick for the CBS Sports midseason awards, what Gonzaga freshman Lauren Whittaker has been doing this season also deserves to be talked about.\nThe 6-foot-3 forward is averaging 20.1 points per game, which is 17th best overall in the nation. She is also in the top 20 in rebounds with 10.3 per game. Despite Gonzaga losing 92-87 to Oregon State in overtime during the Zags most recent outing, Whittaker showed she can perform against top competition with 37 points and 14 rebounds. That was her 11th double-double, which is the most for any freshman and tied for 10th most in the country.The New Zealand native arrived to Gonzaga late December 2023 but chose to redshirt instead of stepping on the court midseason. She had to wait even longer for her debut because she tore her meniscus ahead of the 2024-25 season and qualified for a medical redshirt.\nVanderbiltWe already knew Mikayla Blakes was a star when she set the NCAA single-game scoring record during her freshman year. However, nobody predicted the Commodores were going to be so successful this season. On Jan. 13, they entered the top five of the AP Poll for the first time since their 2001-02 campaign. They suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of South Carolina on Sunday, but before that, they were one of the last two undefeated teams along with No. 1 UConn. \nShea Ralph's group started this season 20-0, the best start in program history. Vanderbilt went 22-11 overall and 8-8 in conference play last season, which means the team only needs two more victories to tie that win total. They also need just three more wins to tie the most wins in a season in the Shea Ralph era.The SEC is tough and currently has a record 10 teams ranked in the AP Top 25. However, the Commodores inserted themselves into the conversation with a perfect start that included an impressive win against Kim Mulkey's LSU Tigers.\nTexas TechWhile Vanderbilt's 20-0 start to the season was surprising, it was even more surprising that Texas Tech nearly matched that. This is a program that has not reached the NCAA Tournament since 2013, but the Lady Raiders started the season 19-0. The last time they had a winning streak that long was during the 1992-93 season, when Texas Tech won the national championship.\nAs we discussed earlier this month, Texas Tech had a successful start thanks to a combination of returning players improving and strong additions from the transfer portal. The roster might get even more interesting soon, as the team recently signed 7-foot-1 Nigerian center Stephanie Okechukwu, who will be the tallest player in women's college basketball history if the NCAA approves her eligibility. After a perfect start, Texas Tech suffered back-to-back losses to Kansas State and BYU. However, the Lady Raiders responded well with a dominant 77-49 road win against Utah and still have a spot in the AP Top 25.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams have one of the best rivalries going in the NFL, and soon, they could be taking that rivalry Down Under.The Rams will play the NFL's first-ever game in Australia next season, and although the opponent hasn't been announced, it seems the Seahawks have volunteered for the job. During an interview with the Herald Sun in Australia that took place in late October, the Seahawks' director of international, Isabelle Van Coevorden, made it clear her team was interested in facing the Rams at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).\"We would love to,\" she said.Van Coevorden also hinted that the Seahawks have made a direct request with the NFL in hopes of being sent to Australia.\"It's something that we're waiting to hear back from the league. The NFL hasn't announced who their opponent will be,\" Van Coevorden said.\nHer comments were given exclusively to an Australian newspaper, which is likely why they flew under the radar.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Five reasons why Seahawks won NFC to reach big game, including historic rebuild\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe NFL still hasn't announced who the Rams will be playing, but the Seahawks would certainly be an attractive option. Due to the extensive travel involved, sending another West Coast team would make the most sense. The flight time from Los Angeles to Melbourne is almost 16 hours, but a team flying from the East Coast would be looking at well over 20 hours of travel time.With the Rams serving as the designated team, that means their opponent will be one of the nine teams they're scheduled to play at home in 2026: the Cardinals, 49ers, Seahawks, Giants, Packers, Cowboys, Chiefs, Chargers and Bills.\nOut of that group, the 49ers, Seahawks, Cardinals and Chargers are all in the Pacific Time Zone. (The Cardinals are technically on Mountain Standard Time, but Phoenix aligns with Pacific time during daylight saving time.)The NFL has hinted that the game is going to be played in Week 1. Due to the lengthy flight and extreme time difference between the United States and Australia, the league wants to make sure both teams have enough time to get ready for their Week 2 game, so the plan would be to play the Week 1 Australia game early in the week.During an interview back in April, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning, Mike North, revealed that a Wednesday game is one of the possibilities being considered.\n\"I suspect it will probably be early in the week, more like a Thursday, maybe even a Wednesday. That's a possibility that we've discussed,\" North said.Australia has a 14-hour time difference with the Eastern Time Zone, which would certainly create logistical issues for the NFL. For a Wednesday night game to happen, it would have to kick off at 10:15 a.m. Thursday in Melbourne, which would create an 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff on Wednesday night in the United States (and 5:15 p.m. PT on the West Coast).One thing that could throw a wrench into Seattle's hopes of playing in Australia is the fact that the Seahawks are in the Super Bowl. The winner of the Super Bowl generally hosts the Thursday night opener the following season, so if Seattle beats the Patriots, the Seahawks could be scheduled for that game. However, the NFL could still send the Seahawks to Australia and have them host a prime-time game in Week 2. If they're sent to Australia, the Seahawks would still play in the first game of the season -- it would just be in Melbourne.\nAnd let's not forget, if the Rams had won the Super Bowl, they were still going to be playing in Australia next season. The NFL knew there was a chance the Super Bowl champ could open the season Down Under, which is why the Seahawks could conceivably still be sent, even if they beat the Patriots.\"If we do play a game, you will see a lot of Seahawks lead-up and around the game, and if we don't, we will definitely still activate and bring the energy of the Seahawks over to Melbourne,\" Van Coevorden said.It's certainly possible the NFL is waiting to see what happens in the Super Bowl before finalizing whether the Seahawks will be sent to Australia.\nSeattle has been making a strong push to promote the team Down Under. The Seahawks, who were granted marketing rights to Australia and New Zealand in March, sent a contingent to Melbourne in October. The Seahawks even paid for some team legends, the Seahawks Dancers and their mascot to take part in a watch party in Melbourne for their Week 9 game against the Commanders, a game Seattle won 38-14.Van Coevorden thinks a Seahawks-Rams game would be the perfect way to kick things off in Australia.\"I think it's a great matchup and a great first game in Australia,\" she said. \"So, we're really keen on hearing more and our fingers are crossed for sure.\"\nThe Rams and Seahawks faced each other three times during the season, with Seattle winning twice, including Sunday's 31-27 victory in the NFC Championship Game. The 2025 series marked just the third time over the past 75 years that two division rivals played three games in a single season that were all decided by four points or less.The NFL usually tries to avoid sending divisional matchups abroad, but the league softened that stance last year when it sent the Chiefs and Chargers to Brazil. With the Seahawks essentially volunteering for the Australia game, the league could have an easy decision to make -- as long as the Rams are OK losing a home game against a divisional opponent.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There have always been \"buts\" when it comes to Scottie Scheffler at the start of his PGA Tour seasons: He's a great young player, but he hasn't won yet. He's the world No. 1, but he didn't win during the summer. He's striking the ball at a historic clip, but his putting may be historically bad. He is the best player in the world, but he is less than 100% following an injury.Despite these \"buts,\" Scheffler produced jaw-dropping moments and head-turning victories, so let your mind wander and instead imagine what happens when the \"buts\" become \"ands.\"In 2022, Scheffler entered the PGA Tour season without a win to his name. As some questioned his ability to close, no one expected he would kick off this run of success. By the time 2023 rolled around, Scheffler had ascended to the world No. 1 ranking thanks to a four-victory campaign; this despite not entering the winner's circle since slipping on the green jacket that prior April. He picked up two more wins that year without a cooperative putter, which kept a generational ball striker from being considered a generational player. Plus, as his wins came in February and March, he again left the meat of the schedule for the field.\nScheffler entered 2024 ranked 162nd out of 193 players on the PGA Tour in strokes gained putting. Scheffler put a new mallet-style putter in rotation during his sixth start of the season, thinking he would give it a chance in the heat of the battle. No matter how he fared, he promised to keep it in the bag all four days at the Arnold Palmer Invitational.Well, Scheffler won that tournament by five strokes. The putter has not left the bag since.Scheffler's 2024 season was beyond historic. He picked up his second Masters, six other PGA Tour wins and the gold medal at the Paris Olympics. Despite the accolades, the praise and the lofty comparisons, Scheffler still believed he could improve.\nHe again field tested a new method on the greens, a claw-style putting grip from inside roughly 15 feet to repair some struggles from close range. Debuting the new process at the Hero World Challenge, he came away with a six-stroke victory that let the golf world know, yes, he could get even better.Scheffler's win in the Bahamas came less than a month before news broke of his offseason mishap. He suffered a hand injury from improperly using a wine glass to roll out ravioli dough while cooking with friends and family during the holidays. Scheffler was forced to sideline himself -- not only from playing but from preparing.\"It's a bit easier this way. I'm going to try to continue this into the future. This is a little easier offseason than last,\" Scheffler said Sunday after winning the American Express, his 20th victory on the PGA Tour. \"It's one of those things. You look at last year, it is different just because I had made what I felt was so much progress in the offseason, and then to have that basically taken away by 4-6 weeks of inactivity from golf, that has an effect.\n\"To fine-tune the skills that we have out here takes a lot of work. Like the chipping: There's a big difference between hitting a chip to a foot versus 5 feet. If I hit it to a foot, I'm probably never going to miss that foot putt. But if you hit it to 5 feet, your percentages of making that putt go down. When you just kind of see that over the course of four days, that has an effect on where my game is at. So being able to have the whole offseason to prepare to come out here ... to have that time to prepare and get my body and mind right in order to compete, I think, really paid off early in the season.\"Scheffler's preparation is one of his many separators, but it does not receive the same attention as what he accomplishes over 72 holes most weeks. His preparation is neither as breathtaking as his iron play nor as funky as his footwork. It has not seen noticeable improvement like his putting, and it cannot be measured like strokes gained.But it's preparation on which Scheffler hangs his hat. In between dodging comparisons to Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus, who he recently joined as the only players to claim 20 PGA Tour wins and four major championships before the age of 30, and answering a different variation of the same question, wondering how this triumph feels as opposed to the rest, Scheffler beats the same drum over and over again: prepare, prepare, prepare.\nOnce Scheffler was able to prepare himself weekly returning from injury last year, he must have felt unstoppable. He won six of his last 12 tournaments of 2025, including major victories at the PGA Championship and The Open. He has not finished outside the top 10 in a tournament since The Players Championship last March, now almost 11 months ago.Entering the year at hand (no pun intended), Scheffler spent the past offseason in the gym preparing for the long, grueling haul that is a full PGA Tour campaign. The area on which he wished to improve this time around was not a skillset but rather his overall endurance -- another trait spectators are unable to see.Through one tournament, well, so far so good.Scheffler being able to prepare this offseason -- honing his craft, identifying a spot that continues to bother him and attempting to improve upon it -- has led to him answering the bell each time it rings.\nScheffler is a great player, and he continues to close tournaments when in contention. Scheffler is the world No. 1, and he is riding momentum from the previous summer into a new season. Scheffler's ball striking remains historic, and his putting is among the best in the game.Scheffler is the most dominant player in the world, and now, he is 100% healthy at the start of the season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Champions League is back again this week for one of the most eventful matchdays of the season as all the 36 teams involved in the league phase will be playing on Wednesday at the same time. While Arsenal and Bayern Munich have already secured the top eight, most of the other teams will be involved to determine their position in the standings and if they will be playing the playoffs next months. Meanwhile, Eintracht Frankfurt, Villarreal, Slavia Prague and Kairat Almaty are all already eliminated from the tournament. Let's take a look at our weekly power rankings:     1. Arsenal (--)They are still the best team around Europe, but the side coached by Mikel Arteta is starting to show some issues as they lost 3-2 against Manchester United over the weekend only a few days after winning at San Siro against Inter and clinching a top eight spot. There are no real concerns at the moment but they need to be more cynical from now on as they can't miss the opportunity this season to win at least the Premier League for the first time in more than 20 years. 2. Bayern Munich (--)I was not expecting to see them lose their first Bundesliga match of the season over the weekend against Augsburg. Vincent Kompany's side are still one of the best teams around Europe and, like Arsenal, there is no reasons to be worried about them yet. They are still eight points ahead of Borussia Dortmund and have already clinched the top eight in the UEFA Champions League. Next up: knockout stages.  3. PSG (--)Meanwhile, we've got the new leaders of the Ligue 1. It was just a matter of time to see them at the top of the French league standings and here we are. I was expecting to see them improving in the last weeks and it has happened. The match against Newcastle on Wednesday will determine if they will get to the knockout stages directly or through the playoffs. \n 4. Barcelona (--)Lamine Yamal's stunning goal against Real Oviedo made us realize once again why he's one of the best players around Europe and he's a big reason why I strongly believe Barcelona are one of the teams to beat this year. They are at the top of the LaLiga standings despite last week's defeat and they will need to win their last match against FC Copenhagen in the league phase to end up in the top eight. They can make it. 5. Manchester City (--)What's going on at Manchester City? After losing to Bodo/Glimt away last week in the Champions League's second last matchday of the league phase they managed to win against Wolverhampton over the weekend. The feeling is that they are facing some issues while the future of Pep Guardiola is still uncertain. 6. Real Madrid (+1)What a start from Alvaro Arbeloa! Three wins in one week against Levante, Villarreal and against AS Monaco last week in the Champions League debut for the former Real Madrid defender as the new head coach after he replaced Xabi Alonso on the bench of the Spanish giants. It's still early to understand where they can end up this season, but so far so good for them and the new manager. \n7. Inter (-1)They are still showing issues when they face the top teams. After winning the opening four games of the league phase, the Nerazzurri lost to Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Arsenal while they are now at the top of the Serie A standings. I mean, this is not enough if they want to have success in the knockouts. The away game against Borussia Dortmund could be a pivotal moment of their European season.  8. Atletico Madrid (--)Every season, they appear to be struggling and under threat, only to finish among the top teams in the competitions they enter. This campaign is no different: Diego Simeone's side currently sits third in the LaLiga standings and is pushing to avoid the European playoffs, holding 12th place with 13 points.9. Chelsea (+1)If we praised the job done by Arbeloa, we need to do the same here about Chelsea and the new coach Liam Rosenior. He was able to turn the spirit around of this team that seemed a bit lost under Enzo Maresca and the game against Napoli on Wednesday will be fundamental for their European run this season. \n10. Atalanta (-1)Everything has changed since Raffaele Palladino joined Atalanta and was able to turn things around pretty quickly at the club. Atalanta are back in the contention for a European spot in Serie A while they can also end up in the top eight of the Champions League potentially. 11. Liverpool (--)I don't get what's going on at Liverpool. Last week they won 3-0 away against Olympique Marseille, one of the best teams around Europe but then lost 3-2 to Bournemouth this weekend and failed to win the last five Premier League games (four draws, one defeat). Too much inconsistency this season. 12. Newcastle (+1)They needed to improve and they did it. Eddie Howe's side are currently in the top eight of the league phase but they will face PSG on Wednesday, a key match for their European campaign. I'm pretty confident that multiple clubs will try to appoint him in the summer as there will be big changes in multiple teams and a likely domino of coaches. \n13. Olympique Marseille (-1)I was definitely more confident to see them performing better against Liverpool last week, when they lost 3-0 to the side coached by Arne Slot. Roberto De Zerbi's side were also able to win 3-1 against Lens on Saturday, allowing PSG to become the new Ligue 1 leaders. 14. Borussia Dortmund (--)While the Bundesliga season seems already over they can focus on their European run. This week they will face Inter on Wednesday at their home stadium, a great opportunity to show the world they are still one of the best teams around Europe despite failing to win the last two matches against Manchester City and Tottenham. 15. Juventus (+1)Luciano Spalletti has done an incredible job and brought Juventus back to their level. Over the weekend, the Bianconeri won 3-0 against Napoli, performing one of their best matches of the season. The road is still a long one, but things are now looking much better. \n16. Galatasaray (+1)Now that Victor Osimhen is back in the team after AFCON they can hope to achieve much more than what they've done over the past two months. 17. Sporting CP (+3) They are currently 10th in the league phase standings and can potentially end up in the top eight and avoid the playoffs next month. What a season for Sporting CP, but sadly for them there is FC Porto doing something absolutely incredible with 17 wins and one draw in 18 matches so far. 18. Bayer Leverkusen (--)Some ups and downs for them this year but we could expect this from them after partying ways with Xabi Alonso at the end of the past season. \n19. Napoli (-4)What is going on at Napoli? Probably too many injuries, but Antonio Conte's side are seriously risking being eliminated from the league phase if they don't win against Chelsea this week. Over the weekend they lost 3-0 to Juventus and likely ended their hopes to win the Scudetto again. 20. PSV (-1)Weekly update of their great season: 17 wins, two draws, only one defeat and a 14-point gap on Feyenoord. Things are playing really well and ending up in the top 24 of the Champions League would be even better. 21. Tottenham (+2)It's difficult to put in words the season they are playing. Thomas Frank's team are in a good spot in Europe (5th place) but facing another big disappointing Premier League season. Which is the real Tottenham? Probably neither. \n22. AS Monaco (--)The 6-1 defeat against Real Madrid told us this is really not their season, but probably we knew that before. 23. Qarabag (+3)They still have a chance to qualify! It will be difficult because they face Liverpool in the last match on Wednesday but the 3-2 win against Eintracht Frankfurt gave them a last chance.  24. Benfica (-1)Will Jose Mourinho qualify or not? Big question. If they do, it means they managed to beat Real Madrid in the last game of the league phase. \n25. Athletic Club (+4)Before last week, I had lost all hope of seeing them reach the next phase, but the unexpected away win against Atalanta has given them another chance heading into the final match.    26. Club Brugge (--)They are finally doing better now, and have a two-point gap on Union SG in the league. They still have a chance to win the title and also qualify for the playoffs in the Champions League. 27. Olympiacos (+6)The 2-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen gave them the chance to qualify quiet surprisingly and facing Ajax away can be the perfect match to show it. \n    28. Copenaghen (-1)After beating Villarreal, they managed to hold Napoli to a home draw despite playing most of the match with ten men. However, the clash against Barcelona may prove too big a hurdle for them to realistically believe in qualification. The potential was always there, they just showed it too late.29. Bodo/Glimt (+5) The win against Manchester City was a surprise for many, but this is a team that could have done better this season in Europe. 30. Pafos (+1)They've got a chance to qualify for the knockouts but its a small one as many other teams do as well. 31. Union Saint-Gilloise (-3)Only one win in the last five Champions League matches won't make them a contender for the playoffs even if they aren't technically eliminated. 32. Ajax (+3)Too late. They are slowing coming back and the last two Champions League wins showed it. They can give themselves a chance with a win against Olimpiacos.33. Eintracht Frankfurt (-6)They are out and that's expected. 34. Villarreal (-4)They probably focused too much in the league and they were already eliminated.  35. Slavia Prague (-3)Three draws and no wins in seven games, that's not Champions League level.  36. Kairat (--)I was really hoping they could do more than just one draw in seven matches. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe No. 1 team in the country faces the potential No. 1 overall pick in the NBA Draft.Few, if any, college basketball games this season will have the intrigue of Monday night's showdown between the top-ranked Arizona Wildcats and the AJ Dybantsa-led BYU Cougars at the Marriott Center in Provo, Utah. The Wildcats (20-0) are one of three undefeated teams in the country and have five wins against Top 25 teams this season. Meanwhile, the athletic 6-foot-9 Dybantsa ranks second in the nation in scoring (23.6 points per game) and is coming off a 43-point mic drop effort in Saturday's 91-78 victory over Utah.In addition, the Cougars (17-2) will be looking for just the second win over a No. 1-ranked team in program history.Arizona is a slim 1.5-point favorite over BYU on Monday.While Wildcats vs. Cougars is the marquee attraction on Monday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes seven NBA games and a full college basketball schedule.

When these teams last met on Jan. 6 Boozer had 27 points on 10-of-12 shooting, eight rebounds and four assists. The Blue Devils won that game 84-73 after trailing by nine points at halftime. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says Duke has a 52% chance to cover and assigns a \"C\" grade to Blue Devils -8.5.No. 1 Arizona at No. 13 BYUTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Provo, Utah | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: BYU +1.5\nThe Marriott Center doesn't get enough credit as one of the toughest road environments in college basketball. The Cougars have won 13 in a row at home, which includes 11 wins this season. Dybantsa, Richie Saunders (18.8 points per game) and Robert Wright III (18.0) give BYU arguably the best scoring trio in the country. They combine to account for 69.6% of the Cougars' points this season. The SportsLine Projection Model says BYU has a 63% chance to cover and gives a \"B\" grade to BYU +1.5.NBA best bets, where to watchMagic at CavaliersTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Cleveland | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Cavaliers -6.5\nCleveland may be starting to turn its season around. The No. 1 team in the Eastern Conference last season, the Cavaliers (27-20) have won five of their last six and are seven games over .500 for the first time this season. Just two nights ago Cleveland beat this same Magic team in Orlando, 119-105, despite the game being the second half of a back-to-back. One of the main reasons for the Cavaliers' turnaround is Donovan Mitchell, who has scored 69 points over the last two games, including 36 on Saturday. The SportsLine Projection Model says Cleveland has a 67% chance to cover and assigns a \"B\" grade to Cavaliers -6.5.Trail Blazers at CelticsTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Boston | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Over 224.5\nWhat team now has the No. 1 offense in the NBA? That would be the Boston Celtics (28-17), who average 121.2 points per 100 possessions, just ahead of the Nuggets (121.0). At home, the Celtics are slightly better, averaging 121.8 points per 100. On Monday, Boston has a favorable matchup against a struggling Portland defense. The Trail Blazers (23-23) are giving up 115.1 points per 100, which ranks 18th in the league. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 60.1% chance the teams combine for 225 points or more and gives a \"B\" grade to Over 224.5. Note Portland star Deni Avdija is questionable to play on Monday and his status is worth tracking prior to the game.Warriors at TimberwolvesTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Minneapolis | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Warriors +224 | Expert: Timberwolves -7.5 (Bruce Marshall)\nThe Warriors and Timberwolves face each other for the second night in a row at the Target Center. On Sunday, Stephen Curry scored a team-high 26-points as the Jimmy Butler-less Warriors (26-21) blew out the Timberwolves 111-85. Minnesota (27-19) has now lost five straight games. Marshall notes, however, that the team that loses the first game of these baseball-type series usually has the advantage in the second game. \"And the Warriors are unlikely to reprise their Sunday effort without Jimmy Butler and almost assuredly minus Jonathan Kuminga on Monday,\" he says. The SportsLine Projection Model disagrees. It says Golden State has a 44% chance to win and assigns a \"B\" grade to the Warriors money line (+224).\n            ",

Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders has been added to the Pro Bowl as a replacement, as first reported by Jordan Schultz. Sanders is the first fifth-round rookie to make the Pro Bowl since Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua. The original AFC quarterbacks selected to the Pro Bowl were Josh Allen, Justin Herbert and Drake Maye. With Maye off to the Super Bowl, there is at least one spot open for a new quarterback in the NFL's all-star games. Sanders went 3-4 as the starter this season, and completed 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions in eight total games played. After being made the inactive emergency third quarterback for the first half of the season, Sanders got his first career start in Week 12 against the Las Vegas Raiders. Sanders led the Browns to a 24-10 victory, and completed 11 of 20 passes for 209 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He became the first Browns quarterback to win his first career start since 1995.While Sanders won his first NFL start, he registered the second-worst completion percentage since Week 11, which was his NFL debut, and threw an NFL-high 10 interceptions in the last eight weeks of the season as well. Sanders was pressured on an NFL-high 51% of his dropbacks, yet blitzed at the seventh-lowest rate (24%). \nThe son of NFL legend Deion Sanders fell to the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft despite winning Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year during his final season at Colorado. Sanders was the second quarterback Cleveland selected, as the Browns drafted Dillon Gabriel out of Oregon in the third round. Questions remain about where Sanders stands with the organization, as Deshaun Watson is expected to return to the active roster in 2026 and the Browns are still in the process of selecting their new coach, but Sanders joins the elite club of rookies to make the Pro Bowl. \n            \n    ",

One thing that didn't change, however, was the top team in the poll. Arizona received all 60 first-place votes for the second consecutive week and checked in at No. 1. The Wildcats have now occupied the top spot for eight weeks and counting.Duke moved up one spot to No. 4 after defeating Wake Forest, 90-69.

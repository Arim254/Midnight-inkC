    "body": "\n        Tuskegee University coach Benjy Taylor retained civil rights attorneys following an incident Saturday after his team's 77-69 loss at Morehouse College in which he was handcuffed and escorted off the court. His attorneys, Harry Daniels, Gregory Reynald Williams and Gerald Griggs, said in a statement Sunday they are investigating all legal avenues on Taylor's behalf, including a possible civil lawsuit.The shocking sequence where he was handcuffed and escorted off the floor punctuated a hard-fought battle between the two Division II HBCU rivals. It took place after Taylor and a police offer shared a brief exchange that quickly escalated as the officer grabbed his handcuffs from the back of his belt and put them on Taylor.According to Taylor's attorneys, he asked two police officers to enforce conference-mandated security protocols over concerns that Morehouse football players were intermingling with the basketball players on the court and causing a potentially dangerous situation at the end of the game. That was when the police officer handcuffed Taylor and escorted him into the hallway of the gym.Taylor was not charged with a crime and he was released to travel back home with his team.\n\"It would be bad for a police officer to treat anyone like this,\" Harry Daniels, one of Taylor's attorneys, said in a statement. \"But to do it to a man like Coach Taylor, a highly respected professional and role model, to put him in handcuffs, humiliate him and treat him like a criminal in front of his team, his family and a gym full of fans is absolutely disgusting and they need to be held accountable.\"Coach Taylor is a good man who did the right thing to protect his team and deescalate a dangerous situation, and this officer put him in chains for his troubles,\" Daniels added. Video of the incident shows Taylor in a state of bewilderment as he appears to react in real-time to being told he is being handcuffed. His shock quickly turned into a smile, seemingly laughing at how outrageous the situation was.\nAdditional videos released by Taylor's attorneys on Sunday show two officers walking him around a winding hallway and into a room labeled \"Weightroom.\" He had a brief interaction with someone recording, who seemed to allege the officer was cutting up with the football players during the game.\nIt is still unclear why the officer handcuffed him. It is also unclear why they took him into a room that appeared to be locked after escorting him off the floor.Taylor, who has been a basketball coach for 35 years, has been the head coach at Tuskegee since 2019.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe matchup for Super Bowl LX is set, with the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, Feb. 8. For the first time in the history of The Big Game, each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup. New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX. New England quarterback Drake Maye didn't practice on Friday due to an illness. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Seahawks are 11-9 all-time versus New England. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots   odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 45.5, with the Over slightly favored at -112 and the Under a -108. Seattle is at -229 on the money line (risk $229 to win $100).

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, with Seattle prevailing by 1-6 points at +275. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. There are countless 2026 Super Bowl picks with plus-money payouts you can target, from alternate lines to anytime TD scorers to exact score predictions. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

The Under is on a run for both programs as each team has failed to reach the total in each of its last three games. That is simply par for the course for the Gators, as the Under is 13-8 for them this season, with 70% of their home games going under.As for Bama, the controversial return of 7-foot center Charles Bediako has fortified the defense. The Tide have allowed just 71.5 points in his two games, compared to giving up 85.0 points over their first five SEC games. Also, both teams protect the rim like few others as each ranks in the top 20 in blocks per game. The model projects a combined total of 171 points as the Under hits in over 60% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins Florida vs. Alabama, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Alabama vs. Florida spread to back, all from the advanced model that has simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sunday was a massive day in women's hoops -- 20 of the teams in the AP top 25 played, and seven games were between ranked opponents. It was so good we dubbed it \"Super Sunday\" in the lead-up, and the day certainly lived up to that moniker.  We had upsets, historic performances, a rivalry game settled in OT and even a Vic Schaefer jacket toss. If you missed any of it, have no fear, we have you covered. Here are the winners and losers from Feb. 1's action:Winner: UConn's winning streakThe No. 1 Huskies are still undefeated with a perfect 23-0 record thanks to a 96-66 win over No. 15 Tennessee. This one was particularly important because the Lady Vols were their last non-conference opponents and the toughest challenge remaining on their schedule.Tennessee gave UConn a battle in the first half. After a slow start, the Lady Vols fought back and led 40-36 before the break. This was the Huskies' first time trailing in the second quarter all season.\nWhile nothing guarantees UConn staying unbeaten in Big East play, there are no teams in the conference that, at least on paper, seem like they could currently challenge Geno Auriemma's squad. The Huskies have a target on their back, but this result should give them an extra boost of confidence.\nUConn is currently on a 39-game winning streak, but its last loss came to Tennessee last year. Azzi Fudd said she was \"angry, frustrated, embarrassed\" regarding her own performance in that loss, which included three turnovers, three personal fouls and just three field goals. Things were much different this time around. Fudd had 27 points via 11 of 17 shooting from the field, including five 3-pointers. She also had seven rebounds, seven assists, seven steals and even a block. -- Isabel GonzalezLoser: Tennessee's second halfThe Lady Vols beat UConn last year and then put the Huskies on upset alert in the first half of Sunday's game. That effort would have made Tennessee a winner, even if it ended up being a close loss. However, this turned into a 30-point loss, which is the largest margin of victory in series history. UConn now leads the series 18-10 since 1995, which includes winning five out of the last six matchups.\nThings started going wrong halfway through the third quarter. Tennessee went scoreless in the last 4:45 of the period while UConn went on a 14-0 run. The Lady Vols couldn't find the momentum again and have now lost back-to-back games. UConn is the toughest opponent in the nation, but Tennessee really struggled to take care of the ball. By the end of the night, Kim Caldwell's team had given up 36 points off 20 turnovers. -- Isabel GonzalezWinner: The Michigan vs. Michigan State RivalryTechnically, No. 13 Michigan State lost this game in overtime to No. 9 Michigan, 94-91, but this felt like one of those games that boosted everyone's profiles. After all, IInés Sotelo was centimeters away from winning it for the Spartans at the buzzer, but her halfcourt heave rimmed in and out.It was a phenomenal game with a total of 17 lead changes and 13 ties. Both teams shot well -- the Wolverines were 57% from the field and 41% from outside, while the Spartans shot 51% and 46%. The biggest lead for Michigan was eight points, the biggest lead for Michigan State was four points, and it was a one-possession game after each period. Mila Holloway led the way for Michigan with a career-high 26 points, six rebounds and five assists, while Jaylen Brown and Kennedy Blair both had 21 points for the Spartans, with Blair adding 10 rebounds, four assists and three steals.\nAs I mentioned in my preview, this was the first time in history that a Michigan vs. Michigan State women's basketball game has been played when both teams were ranked in the top 15. Games like this one will go a long way to turn this regional rivalry into a national attraction and elevate the profile of women's basketball inside the state and out. And the best news of all? There's a rematch in two weeks. -- Lindsay GibbsLoser: Clarity in the Big 12Headed into Sunday, one of my biggest questions was who would take control of the Big 12. With the two teams tied for first at the top of the conference, No. 12 TCU and No. 14 Baylor, playing the teams right behind them in the standings, No. 21 Texas Tech and No. 22 West Virginia, it seemed either Baylor and TCU would separate from the field or one of them would finally get some room at the top. Instead, West Virginia upset Baylor 70-60 and Texas Tech upset TCU 62-60, and now the Big 12 is a bigger question mark than ever. Baylor and TCU are still tied for first, but neither can be feeling confident right now.West Virginia had Baylor uncomfortable from the opening tip, and the Mountaineers ended up scoring 38 points on a staggering 30 Baylor turnovers. The Mountaineers also outscored the Bears 36-8 in the paint. TCU, meanwhile, lost the game on the boards and at the free-throw line; Texas Tech out-rebounded the Horned Frogs 46-34 and was 13 of 17 from the stripe, compared to Baylor's 3 of 5. -- Lindsay Gibbs\nWinner: Texas Tech's Snudda CollinsOut of all the big wins today, I'm probably most impressed with the performance of Texas Tech during its upset of TCU. The Red Raiders started the season a historic 19-0, but came into Sunday having lost three of their last four, and it was tempting to write them off as an early-season feel-good story. But by taking down TCU, Texas Tech proved that there was nothing flukey about their start and stayed in contention for a top-16 seed.And the main reason why Texas Tech's momentous season is back on track is senior guard Snudda Collins, who matched her career high with 28 points on Sunday, including a crucial 3-pointer with just 32 seconds remaining to put the Red Raiders up 57-55. Collins also had 28 points in Texas Tech's rout of Utah last week, meaning right when her team started to slip, Collins started playing the best basketball of her career. -- Lindsay GibbsLoser: Iowa's paint prowessThe No. 8 Hawkeyes are not usually a bad team near the rim. In fact, they dominated Ohio State in this area 42-14 in their most recent win. However, the tables turned in their 88-65 loss to No. 2 UCLA. Iowa just didn't have an answer in this area and the Bruins certainly took advantage of it. By the end of the third quarter, UCLA had scored more points in the paint than Iowa had scored overall. After 40 minutes, the Bruins had crushed the battle in the paint 56-26.\nWhen asked about what made it so difficult for Iowa, Hannah Stuelke highlighted UCLA center Lauren Betts' size and defense.\"I think they are really good on the inside,\" she said. \"Obviously, Lauren Betts is 6-foot-7 and it's hard to score on 6-foot-7.\"\nAs for Iowa coach Jan Jensen, she said Betts, who scored 16 points, knows how to make good decisions on offense.\"A double team can't really, I don't think, slow down Betts as much. Because I don't think she forces anything ill-advised against the double. She kind of squares ups and then she rockets it to (Gianna Kneepkens). So do you want to give up two or do you want her throw it out for three?\" -- Isabel Gonzalez\nWinner: LSU's historic offenseAfter an 0-2 start in SEC play, the No. 6 LSU Tigers have now won seven consecutive games, and they made a statement with their 103-63 victory against No. 24 Alabama. That was the 12th time this season that LSU reached the 100-point mark, which is the most by any Division I team in the last 25 seasons.It was a full team effort with eight players scoring at least eight points. Jada Richard led the way with 16 points while shooting a perfect 5 of 5 from the field, including three 3-pointers. The game started out close, but the second quarter was key for LSU to start separating itself. The Tigers forced eight turnovers while Mikaylah Williams scored 11 of her 15 total points in those ten minutes. They found a 49-29 lead at halftime and never took their foot off the gas.\nThe Tigers' bench leads the nation in scoring, and they were business as usual on Sunday with a total of 47 points. ZaKiyah Johnson put up 15, while MiLaysia Fulwiley contributed 10. -- Isabel Gonzalez\nLoser: The field's hopes for a No. 1 seedOne of the most hotly anticipated games of the day was the SEC showdown between No. 4 Texas and No. 10 Oklahoma, but even though the final score -- 78-70, Texas -- doesn't look that lopsided, it always felt like the Longhorns were in complete control of the game. Madison Booker and Rori Harmon both played well, and most notably, they got help from their supporting cast -- Justice Carleton had 16 points and eight rebounds, Jordan Lee added 14 points and Aaliyah Crump added 12 from the bench. Meanwhile, Oklahoma's star freshman Aaliyah Chavez was held to just 11 points on 3 of 13 from the field.All year long, last year's Final Four teams -- UConn, South Carolina, UCLA and Texas -- have been in the top four of the rankings. After Texas suffered losses to LSU and South Carolina, I felt it needed a win over the Sooners to keep itself from falling behind the top of the pack. That's exactly what the Longhorns achieved on Sunday. And when you combine that with the dominant wins from UCLA and UConn, it seems increasingly unlikely that those four teams are going to be displaced on the No. 1-seed line. There's a lot of basketball left to play, and a No. 1 seed doesn't guarantee anything, but I'd feel safe pencilling them in.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The second edition of Zuffa Boxing takes place Sunday from the Meta APEX in Las Vegas. In the main event, former junior welterweight champion Jose Valenzuela will take on Diego Torres.Valenzuela started his career 12-0 before running into Edwin De Los Santos in 2022. That night, Valenzuela suffered a third-round knockout for the first loss of his career. That loss was followed by a widely disputed decision loss to Chris Colbert. Valenzuela would get revenge against Colbert in an immediate rematch, scoring a sixth-round knockout with a devastating right hand.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 02 live on Sunday night for no additional fee. Plus, every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!The win over Colbert was enough to set Valenzuela up for the biggest fight of his career, a shot at Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz for the WBA junior welterweight title. Valenzuela made good on the opportunity with a measured performance to edge out a split decision in a major upset.\nValenzuela was unable to repeat that solid performance in his first title defense -- and most recent fight -- when he was nearly shut out by Gary Antuanne Russell to lose the belt.Valenzuela will now look to get back in the win column when he faces Torres, who has fought all but one of his career bouts in his native Mexico.\nThat lone fight in the United States was also Torres' lone professional loss, a 2023 TKO defeat against Raymond Muratalla. That loss has aged well as Muratalla has gone on to become the current IBF lightweight champion.\nTorres has rebounded from the Muratalla loss with four consecutive wins, including two by stoppage.There are other notable names on the three-fight main card, including former WBC interim junior middleweight champion Serhii Bohachuk taking on Radzhab Butaev, who is a former WBA \"regular\" welterweight champion, and former WBC light heavyweight champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk facing former world title challenger Radzhab Butaev.Let's take a look at the odds for each bout as well as how you can catch the action on Sunday before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nZuffa Boxing 02 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookJose Valenzuela -800 vs. Diego Torres +500, lightweightsSerhii Bohachuk -175 vs. Radzhab Butaev +140, middleweightsOleksandr Gvozdyk -550 vs. Radivoje Kalajdzic +380, light heavyweightsWhere to watch Zuffa Boxing 02Date: Feb. 1 | Location: Meta APEX -- Las VegasPrelims begin at 6 p.m. ETMain card begins at 9 p.m. ETWatch live: Paramount+ (subscribe now for just $8.99 per month)PredictionAs mentioned, Torres' lone career loss came against the best fighter he has fought and in the United States. The fight with Valenzuela is very similar for Torres. Like Muratalla, Valenzuela is considerably better than the rest of the fighters on Torres' resume. And Torres is having to come to America again to take on another big challenge. This should be a chance for Valenzuela to get off to a solid start in his Zuffa Boxing debut.

    "body": "\n        You've likely heard that the NBA All-Star Game format is different this season as commissioner Adam Silver continues trying to scrape up interest in a game none of the players take even remotely seriously. So this year, instead of West vs. East or squads chosen by captains, it's going to be USA vs. the World with three teams of eight (two American and one World) for a total of 24 players competing in round-robin tournament. The 10 starters were announced two weeks ago, and on Sunday night the seven reserves from each conference, which were voted on by the coaches, were revealed. Here are the full teams.West starters: Stephen Curry, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Luka Dončić, Victor Wembanyama, Nikola Jokić West reserves: Anthony Edwards, Jamal Murray, Chet Holmgren, Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, Deni Avdija, LeBron JamesEast starters: Jalen Brunson, Tyrese Maxey, Cade Cunningham, Jaylen Brown, Giannis AntetokounmpoEast reserves: Donovan Mitchell, Pascal Siakam, Norman Powell, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Duren, Jalen Johnson, Karl-Anthony TownsI came into this fully prepared to be made about some particular exclusions, but the coaches did the right thing and put both Avdija and Powell in. I didn't think they would. I'm not surprised at LeBron getting in, and if you're on Team Lifetime Achievement, that's cool. I'm not. All four of the guys below, at least, should have gotten in over him. Western Conference snubsKawhi Leonard, Clippers\nLeonard is having a career season for a Clippers team that has been bulldozing teams for the last two months. His 27.7 PPG is a career high. He's on track to join the ultra exclusive 50/40/90 shooting club. His 94% clip at the free-throw line leads the league, as do his 2.1 steals per game. The side by side vs. LeBron isn't even close. \nKawhi, of course, is still the subject of an ongoing NBA investigation into potential salary cap manipulation against the Clippers. Still, this exclusion is egregious. Kawhi is having an extraordinary season. If it's close, fine, give LeBron the benefit of the doubt. But this isn't close. I'm with Ty Lue on this.\nAlperen Sengun, Rockets\nSengun is one of three players in the league averaging at least 20 points, nine rebounds and six assists. The other two are Nikola Jokić (best player on the planet) and Jalen Johnson (All-Star). Houston is one of the best teams in the league and only Durant gets in? \nFrankly, you could make a very strong case that they should have gotten three guys in; Amen Thompson is an All-Star in his sleep in the East and for my money should be in over LeBron for sure and arguably Holmgren in the West, although OKC definitely deserves two nods before Houston deserves three. Either way, Sengun should be in. If Kawhi should be taking LeBron's place, then Sengun takes either Murray or Booker. Murray is having an extraordinary season and has long deserved his first selection, but if we're not playing the \"he's earned it card\" with LeBron, then has he really been better than Sengun? That's close. If I absolutely had to make a call, I'd have Sengun in over Booker. James Harden, Clippers\nI'll agree that the Clippers shouldn't get two All-Stars when they're clinging to a play-in spot, and Leonard is the biggest snub. But Harden has to be mentioned here. Another victim of playing in the West, Harden isn't shooting very efficiently but is the driver of what has been the league's fifth-best offense over the last two months. \nI would obviously have Harden in on pure merit over LeBron, but to be fair, if we're holding LeBron's defense against him (which I am) then Harden doesn't pass that test either. But the offense has been way better. Lauri Markkanen, Jazz\nOnly in this Western Conference can a seven-footer averaging 27 and 7 not be an All-Star. Again, it's not a debate against LeBron. Markannen got snubbed (as did his teammate, Keyonte George, but we can only pick one Jazz guy and Markannen is the one). I know I've mentioned Holmgren a few times as a guy a couple of these snubs have a case against, and it's not that I don't view Holmgren as an All-Star. He clearly is. His defense matters tremendously in an argument with a Markannen supporter. And the Thunder are the best team. \nThe truth is the NBA should get rid of the conference requirement in the voting since conferences aren't even part of the actual game. All of these West guys would be in if we didn't have to pick seven East guys (no disrespect to Pascal Siakam or Norm Powell or Karl-Anthony Towns). But even in the current structure, a 27 and 7 player like Markannen not being an All-Star is pretty crazy.Eastern Conference SnubsMichael Porter Jr., Nets\nPorter has completely reinvented himself as a bonafide go-to scorer and All-Star player in Brooklyn. He is a real delight as one of the few go-to guys operating almost exclusively off the ball, a Reggie Miller type that almost doesn't exist anymore. Take a look at this. \nPorter is averaging more points, rebounds and assists than Powell on higher shooting percentages. \nI love Powell. I'm glad he's in. I would have MPJ in over Towns. Joel Embiid, 76ers\nI'm going to include Embiid here because there was a lot of talk about him getting in, but I think the coaches got this one right. Yes, he's been pretty dominant for a good while now and the Sixers are almost 10 points per 100 possessions better with him on the court, per CTG, but he started out rough and has ultimately only played in 28 games. That means about 20 of them have been truly All-Star level. If you think he should be in over Towns, who is having the worst shooting season of his career, I won't argue with you. But I'm fine with him being left off. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        U.S. men's national team forward Ricardo Pepi is inching closer to a deal to join Fulham before the transfer window closes on Monday, with the Premier League club reportedly agreeing to a deal with PSV for the player's signature.Fulham will pay a transfer fee of roughly $44 million, according to Fabrizio Romano, while Pepi has already agreed to personal terms with the London-based club. The Cottagers have reportedly improved upon previous bids for Pepi's services, the most recent of which came in at $38 million, according to ESPN. The Pepi deal now hinges on PSV's ability to line up a replacement for the 23-year-old, who has 11 goals and two assists in 22 matches across all competitions for the Dutch side.For Fulham, Pepi could pitch into their attacking operation in the short-term after losing forward Rodrigo Muniz to a hamstring injury in November and selling Adama Traore to West Ham United in January. In the long-term, Pepi could become a central figure of their attack if Raul Jimenez leaves on a free transfer next summer.How quickly Pepi slots into Fulham's team, though, is unclear. Pepi broke his arm while scoring in January during a 5-1 win against Excelsior and is expected to be out for roughly two months. He could miss the USMNT's final international window in March before head coach Mauricio Pochettino names his World Cup roster in late May, with Pochettino admitting that it is too early to say when exactly Pepi will return to the pitch.\n\"We'll see with Ricardo,\" Pochettino said in a press conference last week. \"I think we'll see how he's going to come back and start to play and to perform and of course, he's a player that is on our radar, Ricardo. Hope that he can be fit and I think we have time to assess and of course, we are going to make the best decision for him and for us.\"How risky is a move before the World Cup?Pepi joins USMNT defender Alex Freeman, who recently transferred from MLS' Orlando City to Spain's Villarreal, in making a major move in the months before the World Cup, which comes with inherent risks, something Pepi already knows about. Pepi's pre–2022 World Cup transfer from FC Dallas to FC Augsburg proved disastrous, contributing to his absence from the U.S. World Cup roster. Over two seasons with Augsburg, he appeared in just 16 matches and failed to score. A 2022–23 loan to Groningen revived his career, as he scored 13 goals in 31 games, earning a move to PSV ahead of the 2023–24 season, where he has since produced double-digit goals each year.  Regular minutes at the club level are a prerequisite for cracking one of Pochettino's rosters and will likely be taken into extremely serious conversation as he makes his picks for next summer's tournament, which means Pepi and Freeman may have to hit the ground running to ensure they are in the best possible position to perform at the World Cup. That is especially true for Pepi, who could theoretically carve out an important spot in the USMNT's attack.\nMonaco's Folarin Balogun seems like Pochettino's preferred starter in the No. 9 position but the head coach has a few options to pick from, a list headlined by Coventry City's Haji Wright and Ricardo Pepi. They are not alone in the depth chart, though – Derby County's Patrick Agyemang has become a contender despite only earning his first cap a year ago, while Josh Sargent will hope to be in the mix. (Sargent himself may also be on the move before the window closes on Monday, attempting to force a move from Norwich City to Toronto FC, though playing time is not the reason for his push to join the MLS club.)Pochettino, though, has a more positive perspective on transfers during the winter window, even if a move from the Netherlands to England might be a considerable step up for Pepi.\"For me, always, it's positive,\" Pochettino said. \"When you change, it's because you are convinced you are going to be in a better place than the place that you are, no? And I think that is why, always, I am very optimistic, I'm very positive in all the moves … All the coaching staff, we need to support our players and always because it's too many things that can happen around. It's always being supportive and [to] give the confidence that the decisions they are going to make are the best decisions. That is why I am not worried, I am not concerned about if some players are going to move in that transfer window because always, what I expect [is] the best thing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks may have lost their last four games, but it's clear they drafted a superstar in No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg.The Duke product scored 34 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in the 111-107 loss to the Houston Rockets, and delivered a 49-point explosion on 20 of 29 shooting in the 123-121 loss Thursday to the Charlotte Hornets. It marked the most points scored by a teenager in NBA history, and Flagg's second 40-point game. LeBron James and Anthony Edwards are the only other teens to drop 40 points in multiple NBA games.It took Flagg some time to get rolling at the next level, and part of that was because he was called upon to be a primary ball-handler. Following Dallas' loss to Houston, a reporter asked coach Jason Kidd about the criticism he took for that decision, and he went off on an epic rant.  \"I don't give a f--- about the criticism. Criticism? That's your opinion. You guys write that bullshit,\" Kidd said. \"That's not -- I've done this. I've played this game. I've played it at a very high level. I know what the f---   I'm doing.\n\"But I don't give a f---   what you guys write. Because you guys have never played the game. And so I build players. So I know what the f---   I'm doing. So to take criticism, it only makes me better. Because if I wasn't doing it right you guys wouldn't be poking holes in what I've done.\"In Flagg's first seven games at point guard, he averaged 13.6 points per contest, 6.3 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.1 turnovers while shooting 38.8% from the field. If one zooms out and examines his rookie season at large, Flagg averages 19.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game while shooting 48.4% from the field. \"I think it's a lot of pressure and a lot of responsibility that comes with being a point guard, and I don't know if I was ready for that or if I was ready to handle that right off the bat,\" Flagg said in November, per ESPN. \"I tried my best, and I mean, that's not to say I can't go back to it and can't work on it and get better, but I think it's just worked out where it's been better to have somebody else helping out, relieving pressure. ... It wasn't perfect, but I think I learned a lot through that.\"\nFlagg will look to stay hot and get the Mavs back into the win column on Tuesday against the Boston Celtics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Cincinnati Reds are bringing back a familiar face. The Reds and third baseman Eugenio Suárez have agreed to a one-year contract worth $15 million, reports ESPN. The deal includes a mutual option for 2027. The team has not yet announced the signing. Suárez, 34, played for the Reds from 2015-21 and had his greatest success in Cincinnati, including a 49-homer season in 2019. He split last season between the Arizona Diamondbacks and Seattle Mariners, hitting .228/.298/.526 with 49 homers. Suárez was much better before the trade (.897 OPS) than after (.682 OPS), which may have hurt his market. We ranked Suárez as the 14th-best free agent this offseason and was the top hitter remaining on the market entering February. Here' the write-up: \nSuárez is a min-max experiment at the plate. He hits the ball hard,  as evidenced by his second career 49-homer season, and he takes his  share of walks. All the while, he ranked near the bottom of the majors  in both whiff and strikeout rate, something that can be attributed in  part to his weakness on pitches located up and in. Suárez will likely  face scrutiny based on his age (35 come July), defense (not great), and  right-handedness. When his bat goes, his spot on a roster will, too, at  whitewater speeds. Until then, Suárez ought to find a home in the middle  of a lineup. \tKe'Bryan Hayes is owed $36 million through 2028 and is maybe the best defensive third baseman in the sport. He won't be relegated to the bench to make room for Suárez. Suárez will almost certainly DH and perhaps play some first base, which will cut into playing time for incumbent first baseman Spencer Steer and top prospect Sal Stewart. All three players are right-handed hitters. The Reds snuck into the postseason via tiebreaker over the New York Mets last season. Their offense was lacking at times, however. They finished 14th in runs and 21st in home runs, which isn't bad, but can certainly be improved upon. Prior to Suárez, Cincinnati's only additions on offense this offseason were platoon outfielders JJ Bleday and Dane Myers. \nLast year's 83-79 finish was the Reds' best since posting the same record in 2021. It was their first postseason berth since 2020, and their first in a full 162-game season since 2013. \n            \n    ",

Morris was fired as Atlanta Falcons coach following the end of the 2025 season. He replaces Robert Saleh after Saleh took the Tennessee Titans' coaching job.Morris, 49, went 8-9 in both seasons in his most recent stint in Atlanta. He also served as an interim coach there in 2020 and also coached the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2009-11. Overall, he has a 37-56 record as a head coach.However, Morris has an extensive background as a defensive coach, including as the Los Angeles Rams' defensive coordinator from 2021-23, a stretch that included a Super Bowl victory. He was also the Falcons' defensive coordinator in 2020 before taking over as interim coach.\nMorris broke into the NFL in 2022 with the Buccaneers as a defensive quality control coach and rose to defensive backs coach before he was hired as head coach at just 32 years old. After three years in that role, he joined Washington as the secondary coach, where he was on the same staff as current 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan. Morris and Shanahan were also on the same staff in Atlanta in 2015 and 2016, when Morris worked on both sides of the ball and Shanahan was the offensive coordinator.The 49ers struggled defensively in 2025, but many of those struggles can be attributed to injuries. Nick Bosa (ACL) and Fred Warner (ankle) both missed double-digit games, and first-round rookie Mykel Williams only played roughly half the season after tearing his ACL. The 49ers still managed to make the playoffs, where they beat the Philadelphia Eagles before losing to the Seattle Seahawks.\nSan Francisco had one of the NFL's least-productive pass rushes, something that will certainly be an area of focus for Morris. San Francisco spent each of its first five picks in 2025 on defenders, and their development will be crucial.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders aim to hire Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak as coach, NFL Media reports. The deal cannot become official until after Super Bowl LX, when Kubiak and the Seahawks take on the New England Patriots.Kubiak, 38, directs one of the NFL's top offenses with Sam Darnold at the helm. Prior to his year in Seattle, Kubiak was the New Orleans Saints' offensive coordinator in 2024, and before that, he worked as the San Francisco 49ers' pass game coordinator under Kyle Shanahan. He also worked under his own father, Gary Kubiak, as well as Kevin Stefanski with the Minnesota Vikings. Several aspects of his father's offense as well as the Shanahan and Stefanski offenses are seen in his offenses. Seattle ranked second this season in under-center rate and seventh in play-action dropback rate. The Seahawks led the NFL in yards per attempt on play action passes, too.Overall, the Seahawks' offense was eighth in points per game and yards per game, sixth in yards per play and second in net yards per pass attempt. Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (NFL-leading 1,793 receiving yards) both made the Pro Bowl.With Klint in line to become coach, he and Gary Kubiak will be the 10th father-son head-coaching duo in NFL history, joining ...Brian and Marty SchottenheimerKyle and Mike ShanahanBrian and Bill CallahanDave and Don ShulaRex and Buddy RyanWade and Bum PhillipsMike and Dick NolanJim Mora Jr. and Jim MoraJohn and Jim FasselSan Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak -- Klint's brother -- also received some head-coaching interest this hiring cycle.\nKlint Kubiak, who also interviewed with the Arizona Cardinals, will have his work cut out for him in Las Vegas. The Raiders come off a dismal 3-14 campaign under Pete Carroll, who got fired after one season. On the bright side, the Raiders own the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft and are widely expected to select Heisman Trophy- and national championship-winning Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza. The Raiders have several holes to fill, though, and the offensive line will be the biggest question mark. Pro Football Focus graded Las Vegas as the 28th-best pass-blocking unit and the 30th-best run-blocking unit.There is some young talent, though, led by tight end Brock Bowers and running Ashton Jeanty. Bowers caught 112 passes for 1,194 yards as a rookie in 2024 before an injury-impacted 2024. Jeanty, meanwhile, finished with 1,321 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns even with underwhelming surroundings. He recorded 188 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns in Week 16 against the Houston Texans, one of the league's premier defenses.\nOn defense, one of Kubiak's first tasks will be dealing with the Maxx Crosby situation. Crosby was shelved for the season late due to a knee injury, a decision with which Crosby vehemently disagreed and left him pondering his future. Kubiak could aim to bring some Seattle defensive coaches with him to Las Vegas as he builds his staff.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Serie A match between Cremonese and Inter was temporarily stopped after a firecracker thrown from the away fans section of the Stadio Giovanni Zini exploded next to goalkeeper Emil Audero. The game was stopped for around three minutes at the 48th minute as the Cremonese player was assisted by the physios and was able to continue playing against his former team. Audero, who played for Inter during the 2023-24 season and moved to Cremonese in the summer of 2025, faced moments of fear when the firecracker ended up near him, but luckily, he appeared to come away uninjured.\nInter were fortunate, because had the match been suspended, the Nerazzurri could have been handed a 3–0 defeat, as has happened in similar cases in the past. However, since Audero was able to resume play, that scenario was avoided. Inter captain Lautaro Martinez and the Nerazzurri manager Cristian Chivu immediately went close to the away section, and tried to calm things down a bit as it remains unclear the reason behind the shameful gesture.\nSpeaking to DAZN after the game, Lautaro Martinez spoke on the matter, saying, \"These things should never happen. We are footballers, and you put a person's safety at risk. An apology is owed to Audero, a champion of the second star, and to the Cremonese supporters.\" Inter Presidente Giuseppe Marotta said to Sky Italy, \"Sport has values that are truly far removed from what we witnessed. The authorities are carrying out investigations into what was an isolated act, and what I think is shared by all Inter supporters: football must be completely removed from such incidents. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms, and we also thank Audero for his professionalism. The authorities will identify those responsible; the condemnation from the entire Inter club for what happened is explicit and total. A truly senseless act.\"\nInter won 2-0 against Cremonese thanks to the goals scored by Lautaro Martinez and Piotr Zielinski in the first half, and the Nerazzurri are now leading the Serie A standings by eight points over AC Milan, who will face Bologna on Tuesday at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Please do not put in the paper that Jason Kidd was mad. Jason Kidd was not mad. He does not care what you or anyone else thinks. He certainly does not care what the national media writes about him. You might have watched his postgame press conference on Saturday following a tough road loss to the Rockets and thought but he seems kinda worked up. No. That was just the criticism making him stronger. He feeds off it. I'm paraphrasing Kidd now, which is pretty much all we can do in this space because, despite not being mad, Kidd used a whole host of expletives in his answer that we can't fully revisit in this space. If we did we'd have to bleep out most of it and it would come off like that scene in Ocean's Twelve where Don Cheadle is in the recording studio.   The context: despite the loss in Houston, Cooper Flagg is killing it right now. The rookie had 34 points, 12 rebounds and five assists against the Rockets, making him the first teenager since Luka Dončić to drop a line of 30/10/5. The game before that, Flagg went for 49 points against the Hornets, which was the most by a teenager in NBA history. In the process, he also became the first teenager to have back-to-back 30-point double doubles. As Kevin Durant said in a wild understatement following the Rockets win, \"he's figured it out.\" (Tough timing for Jamal Mashburn.)After a shaky start to the season where it looked like he was being asked to do too much, too soon, Flagg is cruising these days. Which brings us back to Kidd definitely not being mad. The Mavericks head coach was asked about the criticism he got early on for playing Flagg at point guard in the absence of Kyrie Irving (who is still recovering from an ACL injury) and whether that bothered him given how Flagg is currently flourishing. Kidd could not have been more unbothered (full NSFW answer here).\n\"I don't give a f--- about the criticism,\" Kidd replied. \"Criticism? That's your opinion. You guys write that bulls---,\" Kidd said. \"That's not -- I've done this. I've played this game. I've played it at a very high level. I know what the f--- I'm doing.\"Kidd said the criticism \"only makes me better.\" (You're welcome, I guess?) He also tried to prop himself up on that tired and lazy crutch that former athletes sometimes employ by reminding the media that he played in the NBA and they did not, thereby implying that invalidated their thoughts on the matter of Flagg's ability or Kidd's coaching. That approach always seems silly to me, as though Kidd in turn couldn't have an informed opinion on movies because he's never starred in a film or politics because he's never been an elected official. Still, Kidd can be forgiven for his momentary fit of pique. In the immediate aftermath of the loss, he was upset at the officials for failing to call a foul on Flagg's drive to the basket late in the game. But also, not to go all unlicensed therapist on him, something tells me his outburst wasn't just about the refs. \nBecause here's the thing: Jason Kidd was right. He pushed Flagg into the deep end right away to start the season, and while I and a lot of other media members were busy writing that the Mavs should throw the kid a life preserver in the form of some guard help before he drowned, Flagg proved his coach correct and kept his head more than above water. Those early struggles have seemingly set Flagg up for his current success and what forecasts as a very bright future indeed. He's only 19. It feels like every time we mention him now it comes with a caveat that he's the first teenager to do whatever it is he just did. So Kidd is maybe a little defensive about all that. Understandable. Not to mention that it's been a bit of a rough year for the Mavericks and their fans. [Whispers just in case anyone from Dallas is within earshot] It has been exactly one year since the Mavs did the unthinkable and traded Luka to the Lakers. In exchange, Dallas received Anthony Davis, Max Christie and a lone first-round pick. The swap was so inadvisable and unimaginable that everyone needed confirmation that yes it was real.If the move itself wasn't bad enough, the hamfisted post-trade spin was even worse. Then-general manager Nico Harrison insisted he had \"no regrets\" despite the intense fan and media backlash, and Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont initially backed him up in a disastrous interview that will forever serve as an example to all new owners on what not to say. Dumont eventually came to his senses earlier this season and fired Harrison, who I suspect now has more than a few regrets. \nIf they could do it over again, the Mavs would obviously not have traded their superstar and the fan-favorite face of the franchise, a man who had led them to the NBA Finals and at that point had made first-team All-NBA in five straight seasons. And they certainly wouldn't have fat shamed Luka and sent him to the hated Lakers. Bad ideas all the way around. But as consolation prizes go, Cooper Flagg is pretty good. To be clear, one thing has nothing to do with the other, of course. Landing Flagg was a total stroke of luck. Dallas had only a 1.8% chance of landing the top pick in the lottery, but the Basketball Gods willed it and now Flagg is a teenager who's already playing like a grown man. Imagine how good he'll be when he's actually a fully grown man. The mind boggles.The Mavericks still have plenty to work out. They remain outside the play-in. Davis may or may not play again this season. They're still waiting for Kyrie to return. The lack of reliable backcourt production remains an issue. And it would be nice to find someone in a similar age range to place on the same timeline as Flagg. But considering how directionless and hopeless everything seemed when Luka was shipped to Los Angeles, the Mavs have to feel a whole lot better about their prospects now that Flagg is playing at such a high level. For the first time in a year, to borrow one of the cleaner components of Kidd's rant, they seem like they know what they're doing. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe NFL Week 18 Saturday matchup between the Carolina Panthers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers will go a long way in determining who wins the NFC South and earns a playoff berth. Carolina (8-8) faces a win-and-in scenario, while Tampa (7-9) must win to have a shot at the postseason. The Bucs need a win and an Atlanta loss to New Orleans on Sunday to clinch a postseason spot and the NFC's No. 4 seed. Both teams are coming off Week 17 losses, while the Bucs have dropped four in a row overall, including a loss to the Panthers in Week 16. Starting cornerback Jamel Dean (shoulder) is out for Tampa Bay. Linebacker Claudin Cherelus (calf/ankle) is out for Carolina, while defensive lineman Tershawn Wharton (hamstring) is inactive after being listed as questionable on the injury report.Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. The latest Panthers vs. Buccaneers odds list Tampa as the 3-point favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 43.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook.

Tampa has dropped a staggering eight straight games ATS, as its 5-11 record versus the line this year is the worst in the NFL. The Bucs are just 1-6 ATS at home, while Carolina brings a 9-5 spread record as an underdog in 2025. On the field, the Panthers can take advantage of the Bucs' No. 30 redzone defense and a team that hasn't won the turnover battle in each of its last four games, which were all straight-up defeats. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Buccaneers can coverTampa has owned the recent matchups in this series, going 9-2 over their last 11 meetings. The Buccaneers also have the edge in one of the most important stats in any level of football, and that's the turnover margin. The Bucs have the fifth-best turnover differential (plus-five) in the NFL, while the Panthers are just tied for 14th with as many takeaways as giveaways. Tampa Bay also has a clear strength of running the ball as it has the No. 7 rush offense, despite missing Bucky Irving for nearly half of the season. Thus, the Buccaneers can exploit Carolina's run defense, which ranks 24th in terms of yards per rush allowed, and just three teams have given up more rushing touchdowns (24) than the Panthers. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Buccaneers vs. Panthers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Panthers vs. Buccaneers 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 48 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in more than 50% of simulations. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Bucs vs. Panthers, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

After two seasons atop the division, the Detroit Lions will miss the playoffs for the first time since 2022. On Sunday, they'll try to play spoiler against the new division champion, the Chicago Bears, who are playing for a chance to capture the NFC's No. 2 seed. With a win over the Lions, the Bears would host division rival Green Bay in the wild card round. Chicago will drop to the No. 3 seed, however, if they do not defeat the Lions and the Eagles beat the Commanders. The Bears will be the No. 2 seed if both they and the Eagles lose on Sunday. Along with playing the role of spoiler, the Lions are also trying to record their fourth consecutive winning season. Detroit started 7-4, but were eliminated from playoff contention after last week's loss to the Vikings evened its record at 8-8. \nWhere to watch Lions vs. Bears liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation:  Soldier Field -- Chicago, Illinois TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bears -3, O/U 50.5 (via DraftKings)Lions vs. Bears: Need to know Last time we met. After a season-opening loss, the Lions responded with an emphatic, 52-21 win over the Bears in what was Ben Johnson's first game against his former team. Johnson was asked afterward about Dan Campbell's decision to go for it on fourth-and-goal late in the game despite the lopsided score. \"What's he supposed to do?\" Johnson said. \"It's fourth-and-goal, what do you want him to do? Yeah, he could have kicked the field goal. They don't kick field goals; they go for it there. He was doing what he's supposed to do. That's what he does.\"Hungry Bears. A big reason for Chicago's success this season has been its ability to force turnovers. The Bears lead the NFL with 32 forced turnovers this year, which includes at least one forced turnover in 14 of their first 16 games. Ironically, Chicago's loss to Detroit in Week 2 is just one of two games this year where it didn't force a turnover. Ball hawking secondary. The Bears' secondary has played a key role in the defensive's success in terms of getting turnovers. Chicago has picked off 22 passes, with safety Kevin Byard recording a league-high six picks. Captain Comeback. Caleb Williams has often been at his best late in games. He's led six fourth quarter comebacks and six game-winning drives this season. Dynamic duo. Williams has been complemented by one of the league's best running back duos in D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai. This duo has combined to rush for 1,816 yards and 14 touchdowns and caught 50 passes for 440 yards and one score. Wounded Lions. Injuries have played a key role in Detroit's disappointing season. They are currently dealing with several notable injuries, including ones to wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee), defensive tackle Alim McNeill (abdomen), lineman Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness) and linebacker Alex Anzalone (concussion). Lions vs. Bears prediction, pick \nWhile I can definitely see the Lions duplicating what they did in 2022 (upsetting Green Bay on the road in a game that meant nothing in terms of the playoffs), it's hard to pick against a Bears team that still has something to play for, along with the fact that there is a score to settle after losing by 31 points in Detroit back in Week 2.  Pick: Bears, -3, Over 50.5 \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The Broncos are coming off a 20-13 win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas, while the Chargers were defeated by the Houston Texans in Week 17, 20-16.The No. 1 seed in the AFC is on the line in this matchup, as the 13-3 Broncos can clinch the first-round bye with a win. They would fall to the No. 2 seed in the AFC if they lost while the 13-3 New England Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins. As for the Chargers, they are locked into a wild-card spot. They currently occupy the No. 6 seed in the AFC behind the Texans and ahead of the Buffalo Bills. Both of those teams are also 11-5, and favored to win their respective matchups this weekend. Trey Lance will start at quarterback for the Chargers, as Justin Herbert gets a week to rest. Let's break down this AFC West matchup. But first, here's how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Chargers vs. Broncos liveDate: Sunday, Jan. 4 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -12.5, O/U 37.5 (via DraftKings)Chargers vs. Broncos: Need to knowChargers resting starters? On Monday, Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters that quarterback Justin Herbert will not start in the regular-season finale against the Broncos. In addition to Herbert, Harbaugh said that other starters with \"the most bruises\" and that need \"the most healing\" won't play, either.The lucky one seed. Denver has a great shot to secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC this week. The Broncos have made the Super Bowl six of eight times when earning the No. 1 seed in the conference. With no Patrick Mahomes, no Joe Burrow and possibly no Lamar Jackson, the AFC is certainly wide open this year.How inexperienced is Lance? The former No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft undoubtedly has potential, and earned the backup job in Los Angeles this preseason. However, consider this stat: Bo Nix has more passing attempts this year (589) than Lance has in his EIGHT-year college and pro career (474)!Broncos closing in on sack record? This Denver defense is one of the best in the NFL, and has recorded a franchise-record 64 sacks this season. The Broncos are now nine sacks away from breaking the NFL record. Nine is a large number, but the Broncos defense did record nine sacks in Week 6 against the New York Jets. Chargers offensive line issues. The Chargers have started 10 different offensive line combinations this season compared to Denver's four. Los Angeles has started six different offensive tackles this season, which is tied for most in the NFL. Chargers vs. Broncos prediction, pick\nIt's not a hot take to predict that the Broncos will win this game, but will they cover the spread? We did see Denver fail to cover the spread against a lesser opponent on Christmas. The Chargers are 5-0 straight up and against the spread this season against divisional opponents. Only six teams since 2000 have finished undefeated straight up and against the spread in divisional play. Thirteen points is a large number, but with this game taking place in Denver and the Broncos motivated for a win, we'll take the AFC West champions. Pick: Broncos -12.5, Over 37.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Ole Miss might lose most of its LSU-bound coaches to former coach Lane Kiffin this week, but it will keep at least one critical piece of the offensive staff in place as the Rebels prepare for the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. is in Oxford and will continue leading the Rebels' offensive unit through at least this week's semifinals game, head coach Pete Golding confirmed Saturday. Weis Jr. is set to take over as LSU's OC whenever the time comes. Several position coaches, however, are expected to remain at LSU after coaching the Rebels to a thrilling 39-34 victory against Georgia in the quarterfinals on New Year's Day, sources told CBS Sports.Running backs coach Kevin Smith will not return to Oxford this week, 247Sports' Chase Parham first reported Saturday. Tight ends coach Joe Cox, receivers coach George McDonald, analyst Dan Stevens (quarterbacks) and graduate assistant Sawyer Jordan (slot receivers) are also in flux and are not expected as of Saturday to return to Ole Miss, sources told CBS Sports. They remained in Baton Rouge, helping with recruiting visitors after the transfer portal opened Friday.\nGolding, who was elevated from defensive coordinator to head coach when Kiffin bolted for LSU, did not confirm the status of the position coaches, but said he has been in \"constant\" communication with LSU and Kiffin about the staffing situation. Kiffin echoed those words in a statement to ESPN on Friday.\"They have every opportunity like they have up to this point to be able to make that decision,\" Golding said Saturday. \"So, week in and week out, I don't dictate whether they do that or not because they're not employed by me. Up to this point, that is how it's been and that's my expectation.\"Questions about Ole Miss' staff have lingered over the program since Kiffin left the program to take over at LSU on Dec. 1. He hired eight staffers from Ole Miss to his LSU staff. However, many remained in Oxford through the first two rounds of the playoff -- a 41-10 win against Tulane and the aforementioned thriller against Georgia.\nComplicating matters is the football calendar. The transfer portal opened Jan. 1 and will remain open until Jan. 16, and both schools were expected to host players for visits this weekend.FBS programs are allowed an unlimited number of staffers after previously only allowing 11 on-field coaches, which has alleviated much of the workload, Golding said.\"We've got a lot of coaches here,\" Golding said. \"That's the one thing about Division I football. This building is filled with guys that have been elite coaches everywhere they've been. Once they eliminated the rule to where there's not 10 coaches, as long as they're employed here, you can have a million coaches that can instruct on the field. So at every college across the country, a lot of guys that you all don't know by name are actually the ones instructing and teaching players, and so we have an elite staff here that's been together for a long time that knows the ins and the outs.\"\nGolding said he wasn't sure when he'd receive clarity on the staffing situation. Ole Miss departs for the Fiesta Bowl on Tuesday. Kickoff is slated for Thursday at 7:30 p.m. ET.\"It's grown people making decisions, so I have no idea,\" he said. \"So we're gonna go out there and spot the ball. We've got plenty enough people in this building that showed up this morning. We'll be just fine.\"LSU did not immediately respond to CBS Sports' request for comment.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Getting back to playing soccer after the winter break can lead to some strange results, but Barcelona avoided dropping points in a 2-0 derby win against Espanyol. Hansi Flick's team struggled to hit the targets in the first half, giving their rivals hope that they'd be able to get all three points, but that was dashed in the second half with Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski finding the back of the net in the second half of play.Due to LaLiga having a winter break, Barcelona's last match was on Dec. 21, and while the time off did give the players the opportunity to reset, it also meant that there was plenty of rust to shake off in a bad match to do it in. The Derbi Barceloni has seen the two sides meet 219 times, and while Barcelona have won 129 of those meetings, Espanyol are a side on the rise, pushing for a Champions League place in the league.Barcelona keeper Joan Garcia also felt the heat after crossing rivalry lines to become the starting keeper for Barca in the summer. He was booed heavily and called a rat by fans, but wouldn't let that stop him from making six saves during the match en route to a clean sheet for Barcelona.In the first half, Espanyol were unlucky not to score, and they held Barcelona to only one shot on target before Flick made an important change at the half, introducing Fermin Lopez for Marcus Rashford. Fermin Lopez ended up assisting both of Barcelona's goals to help keep their title charge going.\nWhile Real Madrid still have a match to play on Sunday against Real Betis, Barcelona have opened a seven-point lead atop LaLiga while winning their last eight matches in all competitions. Even their defensive issues have been better since Garcia's return to the lineup, keeping clean sheets in three consecutive matches league matches and four straight games overall. That defensive improvement is what will be important in holding off Real Madrid. Xabi Alonso taking over Real Madrid ahead of this season was supposed to increase pressure in the title race, but as Barcelona's gap atop LaLiga widens both in points and goal difference, where Barcelona have a goal difference of 33 compared to Real Madrid's 20, it feels like the league is becoming Barcelona's to lose. That success is something that will still need to translate into the Champions League, where Barcelona are among the contenders to win the entire thing. Their high line has caused issues at times, but when Garcia is making saves like the ones that he pulled off against his former club, it won't matter how many defenders Barcelona have up the pitch. \nNext up, Barca will have their first shot at silverware this season, taking on Athletic Club in the Supercopa de España semifinal on Wednesday, Jan. 7.\n            ",

That's right, the division title will be decided by two teams that can't even win the division. That became a reality on Saturday after the Buccaneers secured a 16-14 win over the Panthers in an NFC South showdown that didn't end up deciding anything. If Carolina won the game, the Panthers would have clinched the division title, but because the Bucs won, the Saints-Falcons game on Sunday will now decide who wins the division. How is that even possible? That's a great question. Let's answer it. The Falcons pulled off a shocker Monday night when they beat the Rams, 27-24. The win improved Atlanta's record to 7-9 -- and that's where things get interesting.  Let's take a quick look at the NFC South standings so we can break down why Atlanta's win made such a huge difference in the division title race. \nTeamOverall recordHead-to-headConference recordBuccaneers8-92-2 (1-1 vs. Falcons, 1-1 vs. Panthers)6-6Panthers8-93-1 (2-0 vs. Falcons, 1-1 vs. Buccaneers)6-6Falcons7-91-3 (0-2 vs. Panthers, 1-1 vs. Buccaneers)6-5If the Falcons beat the Saints, that would create a three-way tie at 8-9. The Panthers would win the division in that scenario due to having the best head-to-head record among all three teams. That means the Panthers will clinch the division title if the Falcons beat the Saints. On the other hand, the Buccaneers will be cheering hard for the Saints, because Tampa Bay will win the division if New Orleans pulls off a win or tie. In that scenario, the Bucs and Panthers would finish in a two-way tie at 8-9. If that happens, Tampa Bay would win the division thanks to the common-games tiebreaker. If the Falcons had lost to the Rams on Monday night, then the Buccaneers would have clinched the division title with their Week 18 win over Carolina.The fact that Baker Mayfield now has to cheer for the Saints is kind of hilarious considering just two months ago, he made it very clear he doesn't like them. \nThe team that ends up winning the NFC South will go into the postseason as the fourth seed and host either the Rams, Seahawks or 49ers in the opening round of the playoffs. Although that might sound like a favorable matchup for one of those three NFC West teams, don't forget: The Buccaneers beat the Seahawks and 49ers this year, while the Panthers beat the Rams.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        North Carolina's defensive collapse Saturday in a 97-83 loss on the road vs. SMU was bad. No no, let me rephrase that: North Carolina's defensive collapse Saturday on the road vs. SMU in a 97-83 loss was catastrophically, historically horrific.  The Tar Heels allowed the Mustangs to post a 71.7% effective field goal percentage while finishing with a 139.9 defensive rating. Both marks, according to the KenPom.com database that includes game data all the way back to 1997 (!!), are second-worst in a single game for an historically proud UNC program.  The 71.7% effective goal percentage is the sixth-highest percentage a major conference team has finished with this season in a game when facing another major conference opponent, per CBB Reference data.  UNC coach Hubert Davis postgame did not have immediate answers about how to fix the troubles that ailed his team on D in the loss. But he did have an answer about what happened Saturday, which more or less came down to two words: Boopie Miller. \nSMU's Miller sliced and diced UNC's defense to the tune of 27 points and 12 assists and controlled the game throughout. He scored or assisted on 57 SMU points. Davis said Miller with the ball was dangerous as a shooter, but he was just as lethal when UNC tried to take the ball out of his hands. It was a catch-22 for the Tar Heels defense -- and either way Boopie was bopping his team to buckets. \n\"They were able to get anywhere that they wanted to offensively,\" Davis said. \"Boopie was in control of the ball, whether it was one-on-one, ball screen action. His patience, being able to get to his spots, being able to distribute … from an offensive standpoint, we tried to get the ball out of his hands, but he still was able to get the ball to his teammates at the right spot to do something with it. He played a terrific game.\" Miller's 12 assists tied a career-high and his 27 points are the third-highest in a single-game in his career, which began in 2022. He finished 10 of 13 shooting. And worse: UNC's defense was so brutal that it wasn't the only career day for an SMU player. Mustangs forward Corey Washington also set a career-high with five made 3s in the win on seven attempts. He finished with 23 points, which set a new career-high in points for him vs. major conference opponents.  \nDavis said SMU's athleticism, length and physicality \"affected [us].\" He also said Boopie controlling the game the way he did was tough to contend against. But he minced no words about the real problem Saturday. \"We shot 48% from the field,\" Davis said, implying that such efficiency on offense is usually a strong-enough number to get a win. \"But it's the defensive end. You're not going to win hardly any games at all if a team shoots 60%.\" \"It always starts and ends with us with defense, rebounding and taking care of the basketball,\" he added. \"And defensively we just didn't play the way we needed to to beat a team here on the road.\"\n No stopping them now The 97 points scored by SMU on Saturday are the sixth most points allowed by UNC since the 2010-11 season. DateOpponentFinal ScoreResultNov. 27, 2022Alabama103-101 (4OT)LossDec. 17, 2016Kentucky103-100LossFeb. 8, 2020Duke98-96 (OT)LossJan. 22, 2022Wake Forest98-76LossDec. 18, 2021Kentucky98-69Loss\t\t\t\tJan. 3, 2026\t\t\t\tSMU\t\t\t\t97-83\t\t\t\tLossMarch 29, 2019Auburn97-80LossOver the last five seasons in ACC regular season play, 25 teams have shot 60% or better from the field vs. a conference opponent. Only one of those teams went on to win. The evidence is clear: When a team gets that hot, or when your defense is that bad, you have to be nearly flawless to win.  This was an eye-opener for UNC and for Davis. They are not good enough to overcome defensive incompetence. That's the bad, and obvious, news. The good news is that UNC has largely been fine on that end and it has the potential to improve. After Saturday, though, virtually anything would qualify as improvement after what SMU's offense did to it. \n\"Again, it goes back to defense,\" Davis said. \"For us to be the best team we can possibly become, we have to be a good defensive team. SMU shot 60% from the field. That's not going to get it done.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas star Darryn Peterson returned to the lineup on Saturday for the first time in nearly a month and had his best showing of the 2025-26 season. Peterson, who is the No. 1-ranked NBA Draft prospect in the CBS Sports rankings, finished with 26 points, six rebounds and one assist in the No. 17 Jayhawks' 81-75 loss to UCF.Peterson scored 23 of his game-high 26 points in the first half. However, the Kansas star logged just five minutes in the second half and scored three points. Peterson subbed out with 10:55 remaining in regulation and did not return.The former top-ranked player had previously only played in four games before returning for the Jayhawks' Big 12 opener. His last appearance came on Dec. 13 against NC State, when he exited the game late and did not return due to a hamstring injury. \n        \n            \n                Kentucky's good vibes erode as No. 14 Alabama wins fourth straight vs. Wildcats\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat latest setback saw him miss games against Towson and Davidson. In total, Peterson has missed nine games this season.\nPeterson got off to a hot start in the first half against UCF. He scored 11 points in the first six minutes and finished with 23 points before halftime. His previous season-high came against North Carolina, when he finished with 22 points in his second collegiate game.Recapping Peterson's season so farAs stated earlier, this weekend marked Peterson's fifth game of the season. He appeared in games against Green Bay and North Carolina in November before missing a month with a hamstring injury. Peterson returned to the lineup last month against Missouri and finished with 17 points in 23 minutes of action.However, in Peterson's next game against NC State, he appeared to re-aggregate the injury that caused him to miss a month. He subbed out of the game twice down the stretch against NC State but ultimately didn't return. Even with Peterson out of the lineup, the Jayhawks were able to escape with a dramatic 77-76 win in overtime behind a career day from Melvin Council Jr.\nAfter Kansas' final nonconference game against Davidson last month, coach Bill Self addressed Peterson's absence, stating that it was a mutual agreement between the program and his family to hold the prized freshman out of the lineup until he was at full strength. Even in his return against UCF, Peterson logged just 22 minutes.Peterson has only played over 30 minutes once this season. That came against NC State when he finished with 31 minutes.Why Peterson is regarded as a top draft prospectIt's no secret that this freshman class has a chance to be an all-timer. Even with the NBA Draft over six months away, there isn't a definite candidate to go No. 1 overall. That pick will likely come down to Peterson, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Duke's Cameron Boozer.\nThis performance by Peterson was key to his draft stock. For starters, Boozer has been playing like the best player in the country and should be the favorite (if the season ended today) to win player of the year honors. As for Dybantsa, he has also been playing like one of the best players in the country over the last month.Peterson's calling card is his ability to get a bucket whenever it's needed. However, the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft has traditionally featured bigs or wings being taken. Peterson has the chance to be the exception.\nThe last guard taken with the No. 1 pick was Cade Cunningham in 2021. Since 2010, only six prospects who have gone No. 1 have been classified as a guard. Although Cooper Flagg was utilized as a point guard through the first few weeks of his NBA career by the Dallas Mavericks, he is a traditional wing at the NBA level.\nPart of the intrigue around Peterson is his potential to be a volume scorer at the NBA level. Peterson is also a talented defensive prospect who can defend at a high level because of his size and athleticism. But what stands out the most -- and why he may ultimately go No. 1 -- is his shot-making that is second to none in this class. That was on display against UCF.The best version of Kansas will revolve around Peterson staying on the floor. If the Jayhawks can get the first-half version of Peterson down the stretch, it would change the whole dynamic of their season. However, if Peterson is limited like he was in the second half, the ceiling of what Kansas can accomplish in March will be significantly lower.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Inevitable -- that's how Arsenal are feeling about winning any game and their Premier League pursuit as they came from behind to defeat Bournemouth 3-2 away on Saturday to go six points clear. It only took 10 minutes for Andoni Iraola's Cherries to go ahead in the match, but keeping the lead has been where Bournemouth's issues have come in. It only took six minutes for the Gunners to level the match with yet another goal from a set piece via Gabriel.It was Arsenal's 12th goal via a set piece, joint top of the league with Leeds United. Even with the league's growing emphasis on set pieces, no one has been able to keep up with the Gunners, as 30 percent of their goals have come from set pieces. But that wasn't all that Arsenal would need to dig out the win.Declan Rice's return from a knee injury went a long way as the English midfielder produced a brace. It was a lovely first-time finish from outside the box to put Arsenal ahead for good in the 54th minute of play, and he almost replicated it for his second in the 70th minute. The cutbacks from attackers knowing that someone would be in the box show how orchestrated Arsenal have become under Mikel Arteta.\nThis team have grown together, and they're looking to accomplish something that hasn't happened since 2004 and lead Arsenal to a Premier League title. Even when they aren't at their best, they've been able to do enough to stay ahead of the opposition, as even that third goal proved to be important when Eli Junior Kroupi pulled a goal back for the Cherries. It was far from a vintage performance with Bouremouth producing an xG of 1.34 to Arsenal's 1.17, but the difference was in the finishing.To win the title, these are exactly the kind of matches that Arsenal need to find a way to get points from and behind Rice's leadership, they're more than on the right track. Arsenal are in full control of their destiny, even if they drop points facing Manchester City when the two meet in April.\nNow past the midway point of the season, there's still plenty that needs to happen for the Gunners to break their curse of finishing as runners-up in the league, which ahs happened now in three consecutive seasons, but they're on the right track. The matches won't be slowing down anytime soon, with Arsenal hosting Liverpool on Thursday in what will be yet another test for Arteta's men.\n            \n    ",

Brock Purdy and the offense are rolling along, helping make up for a defense that is decimated by injuries. The Niners should be getting George Kittle back in the lineup for this game, so they'll at least be back to full strength on offense.Seattle enters the game as the top seed in the NFC and having also won six straight. The Seahawks are powered by their elite defense, which smothered the Carolina Panthers last week during the team's latest win. The Seahawks knew coming into that contest that if they won out, they got the top seed in the conference, and the same remains true -- as it does for the 49ers.\n        \n            \n                Brock Purdy has traded game managing for dancing -- and the 49ers' Super Bowl window is wide open\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich of these two teams will claim the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch 49ers vs. Seahawks liveDate: Saturday, Jan. 3 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ABC/ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -1.5, O/U 47.5 via DraftKings Sportsbook\nKey storylinesPlayoff picture. It's been talked about ad nauseam at this point, but it's still worth noting: The winner of this game wins both the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC, along with the first-round bye that comes with said slot. If the Seahawks win, the 49ers can actually drop as low as the No. 6 seed if the Rams beat the Cardinals. But if the Niners win, then the Seahawks will be the No. 5 seed and the Rams will be in the 6 spot.49ers offense. San Francisco's offense is on fire during its six-game winning streak, and especially across the three games since it returned from a Week 14 bye. Against the Titans, Colts and Bears, the Niners put up at least 430 yards, 28 first downs and 37 points in each game. They've averaged 455 yards, 29.3 first downs and 42.3 points per week during those contests. They struggled relative to that explosiveness in the first matchup against the Seahawks, though they did still put up 384 yards and 24 first downs, albeit while scoring only 17 points because they turned the ball over twice. Sam Darnold's turnovers. Darnold leads the NFL in giveaways this season, having thrown 14 interceptions and fumbled 10 times, losing six of them. He's turned it over at least once in four of the last five games, and twice in each of the last two. The Niners have had to rely on takeaways in recent weeks, forcing two or more in four of the six games during their six-game winning streak. If Darnold can't take care of the ball, that's a very bad sign for the Seattle offense.CMC's quests. There have only been four seasons in NFL history where a player has run for over 1,000 yards and caught at least 100 passes. Christian McCaffrey is responsible for two of those seasons, having accomplished the feat in both 2018 and 2019. He can do it again if he catches at least four passes on Sunday. McCaffrey is also 110 receiving yards away from a second career 1,000-1,000 season. That's only been done three times in history. The 110 receiving yards part seems pretty unlikely, but four catches is well within the realm of possibility.Prediction\nSan Francisco won this game early in the season, and that was before the Niners got on the roll they are on right now, where the offense is firing on all cylinders. Couple that with the fact that the Seattle offense hasn't been nearly as efficient or explosive as of late as it was earlier in the year, and I find it hard to believe that the Seahawks are going to go into Santa Clara and come away with the victory. Especially if George Kittle is good to go, I like the 49ers -- even though their defense probably lets Seattle's offense also get back on track.  \nPrediction: 49ers 30, Seahawks 27\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

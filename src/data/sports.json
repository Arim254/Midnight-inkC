    "body": "\n        The Milwaukee Brewers lost Game 1 of the National League Championship Series on Monday, dropping a 2-1 contest to the Los Angeles Dodgers that put them down 1-0 in the best-of-seven set. The Brewers threatened in the bottom of the ninth, loading the bases against the Dodgers bullpen. When they fell short, one moment in particular took on greater significance: second baseman Brice Turang's decision to dodge a yanked breaking ball from Blake Treinen that would've tied the game if it struck him.Here's a look at the play in question:\nTurang would then strike out to end the at-bat, chasing after an elevated fastball to conclude Game 1. Afterward, he even wondered why he made such an effort to avoid contact on the above pitch.\"Well, if you see me look in the dugout, I'm thinking, 'Damn,'\" Turang said. \"I know it. Everybody knows it. I couldn't tell you why I did it, I just got out of the way. That's just how it is.\"Major League Baseball's rulebook technically states that batters have to try to avoid contact in order to be rewarded with a base. To quote Rule 5.05(b)(3) directly: \"He is touched by a pitched ball which he is not attempting to hit unless (A) The ball is in the strike zone when it touches the batter, or (B) The batter makes no attempt to avoid being touched by the ball.\" In this situation, though, the pitch strayed far enough into the batter's box that it's hard to envision the umpires invoking that stipulation.\nOf course, Turang wasn't making a calculated decision. He didn't have the time to think it through. He moved out of the way because that's human instinct. You don't have to take us at our word here, either.\"It's a natural reaction if someone turns and makes a gesture towards you, you're going to -- it's the same thing when the ball is coming towards you, your natural thing, it's a breaking ball, your natural thing is to do that,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. \"And I know he was thinking the same thing after the ball passed. It happens. He'll learn from that situation. But it's hard. Even if you try to maneuver yourself, it's hard to get hit by the pitch because it's so reactionary.\"Turang, 25, shouldn't feel too bad about Game 1's non-HBP. He's a big reason why the Brewers are here in the first place, having hit .288/.359/.435 (121 OPS+) with a career-high 18 home runs during the regular season. His contributions were worth an estimated 5.5 Wins Above Replacement.\nTurang and the Brewers will attempt to even the NLCS on Tuesday night. First pitch is slated for 8:08 pm ET.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Tennessee Titans became the first NFL team to fire their coach, as they handed Brian Callahan his walking papers on Monday following a 1-5 start. The Callahan era was a disaster, as the former Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator went 4-19 during his time in Tennessee. Now, yet another coaching search begins.Who could the Titans hire to serve as their next lead man? Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady may be the No. 1 option atop coaching big boards this offseason, but sources indicated to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones that the Titans probably wouldn't want to go with a 30-something offensive coordinator with no head coaching experience after firing Callahan. Tennessee's next coach may be someone who has done it before.According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, two names to watch for the Titans job are Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Both coaches have not only served as lead men before, but also have ties to the Titans in one way or another.New Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi came over from the Chiefs, so he knows Nagy well. Nagy served as coach of the Chicago Bears from 2018-2021, and actually won NFL Coach of the Year in his very first season after leading Chicago to a 12-4 record and NFC North title. However, things went downhill from there, as the Bears finished 8-8 in each of the next two seasons, and then 6-11 in 2021 before Nagy was fired. He left Chicago with a 34-31 record.\n\n        \n            \n                Titans fire Brian Callahan: Kliff Kingsbury, Matt Nagy among coaching candidates to watch\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNagy never won a playoff game during his four seasons with the Bears, and his offense never finished above 21st in yards per game. Following his firing, Nagy returned to the Chiefs and won two straight Super Bowls as Patrick Mahomes' quarterbacks coach and then offensive coordinator. As for Smith, he spent 10 years in Nashville from 2011-2020. The son of FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith worked his way up in the organization from offensive/defensive quality control coach, to offensive line coach, to tight ends coach, to finally offensive coordinator. Smith was calling plays for the Titans during that remarkable 2019 campaign, when Mike Vrabel benched Marcus Mariota for Ryan Tannehill, which propelled the Titans to a 9-7 record and a postseason appearance. The Titans went on a legendary playoff run that year, upsetting Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in Foxborough, then defeating Lamar Jackson and the No. 1-seeded Ravens in Baltimore before ultimately falling to Mahomes and the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game.\nIn 2020, the Titans won the AFC South for the first time in 12 years with an 11-5 record. Smith's offense was tied for No. 2 in yards per game, and ranked No. 4 in points per game. That's when the Atlanta Falcons came calling and hired Smith to be their new coach.Smith registered three straight 7-10 seasons with the Falcons while experiencing plenty of quarterback turnover. His first year was Matt Ryan's last in Atlanta, then came Mariota in 2022 followed by Desmond Ridder and Taylor Heinicke in 2023. After being fired, Mike Tomlin of the Steelers scooped Smith to run his offense in 2024. Pittsburgh made the playoffs last year with a 10-7 record.Nagy and Smith are two offensive minds that have served as head coaches before. That may be the path Titans ownership is trying to take.\n            ",

The Horizon League Player of the Year led the Bulldogs all the way to the National Championship Game against Duke, where his half-court buzzer beater attempt came agonizingly close.\nAfter that season ended, he went pro and the Utah Jazz drafted him ninth overall. After a strong ascension with Utah -- he made the All Star Game in 2016-17, his final year there -- he joined the Boston Celtics via free agency. His career took a shocking turn when he suffered a dislocated ankle and fractured tibia in the opening minutes of his Celtics tenure. He returned the following season and play three seasons in total for Boston before moving onto the Charlotte Hornets. He had a brief stint with the Thunder in 2023-24 and retired in August 2024.\nIn his new role with the Bulldogs, Hayward. a 2022 Butler Athletics Hall of Fame inductee, will \"lean on his NBA experience to advise on talent evaluation and recruitment, player development, and team culture\" and \"serve in a mentorship role to student-athletes within the program, focusing on leadership and professional development.\"Hayward joins a growing list of players taking on similar roles. Recently, Jayson Tatum joined Duke as the Blue Devils' chief basketball officer, and Stephen Curry (Davidson assistant general manager) and Trae Young (Oklahoma assistant general manager) are among those who have joined their former school.\nUnlike those three, Hayward is retired, so he could potentially have more time to help out Thad Matta and company Butler made 10 of 12 NCAA Tournaments from 2007-18, including two national title games, but has not made the Tournament since.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The chances of UCLA ever escaping the Bottom 25 this season looked bleak during an 0-4 start that included a pair of losses to Mountain West teams before the firing of coach DeShaun Foster. In fact, 0-12 seemed like a distinct possibility as the hapless Bruins prepared to host Penn State in Week 6.But since Tim Skipper took over as the interim coach, the Bruins have been on rocket fuel. A win over the Nittany Lions and a 38-13 win at Michigan State in Week 7 boosted UCLA out of the Bottom 25 with room to spare. For a team that was ranked all the way down at No. 4 in the premier metric of college football futility on Sept. 30, that's quite an accomplishment.Beating Penn State and then obliterating the Spartans effectively turned the Bruins from a bottom-feeder into a serious problem for its Big Ten opponents. As the Bruins leave the Bottom 25, two more Big Ten teams are entering this week. Purdue staved off its entry as long as it possibly could, but the Boilermakers are here now. More surprising is that Wisconsin has bottomed out so hard.The Badgers have dropped four straight games without much of a fight and have several more significant challenges looming as third-year coach Luke Fickell slips ever closer to the point of no return. Don't be surprised if Wisconsin soon inhabits the same bottom-five level of shame that UCLA recently occupied.\nThis year's Bottom 25 formula has been tweaked to ensure fair representation from across the sport. Each of the Power Four leagues gets an automatic bid to the Bottom 25 each week, and a total of 10 Power Four schools must be represented.\n        \n            \n                College football rankings: Indiana joins the top 3 after Oregon win as Texas, USC climb new CBS Sports 136\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBottom 25 Rankings^ Joined Bottom 25 this weekPurdue finally arrivesGive Purdue some credit for taking longer to get here than expected. But now that the Boilermakers have arrived in the Bottom 25, we're expecting them to be repeat visitors. With games against Michigan, Ohio State and Indiana still remaining, a 2-10 or 3-9 record is quite possible. However, first-year coach Barry Odom doubled the program's win total from last season by winning his first two games. So at least there's that!25. Arkansas (24)24. Virginia Tech^23. West Virginia (23)22. Stanford^21. Purdue^\nFickle FickellWisconsin just concluded the easier half of its schedule by averaging 8.5 points during four straight losses. How bad could it get in Madison? We're about to find out, as Ohio State and Oregon are the next opponents. Indiana, Illinois, Washington and Minnesota are also left on this slate. The \"worst\" of that bunch is 4-2 Minnesota. Paul Chryst has got to be smirking somewhere after getting canned by the Badgers in 2022 when he had a .720 winning percentage. His replacement, Luke Fickell, is 15-17.20. Eastern Michigan (7)19. North Carolina (20)18. Wisconsin^17. South Alabama (17)16. Arkansas State (12)Dilfer's downfallCelebrity hires are great for headlines and buzz, but UAB is a cautionary tale of how it can go wrong. The Blazers thought it was a good idea to hire former Super Bowl-winning quarterback Trent Dilfer straight from a high school job in Nashville, and they're now paying the price for that mistake. At least Deion Sanders was actually a sitting college coach at Jackson State when Colorado hired him. Sanders also brought stud players like Travis Hunter and Shedeuer Sanders. All Dilfer brought to UAB was embarrassment up until he was fired Sunday with a 9-21 mark midway through his third season.\n15. Penn State (22)14. Air Force (19)13. UAB^12. Nevada (18)11. Northern IllinoisTexas-sized problemsThings have gotten so bad at UTEP that second-year coach Scotty Walden benched former five-star quarterback prospect Malachi Nelson this past week and started last year's QB1, Skyler Locklear, instead. It didn't have the desired effect, as the Miners lost 19-8 to a rudderless Liberty team. But there's a silver lining for CFB sickos: the outcome set up a Bottom 25 showdown for Wednesday, as UTEP will take on winless Sam Houston to decide once and for all who the worst team is in Texas.10. Akron (9)9. UTEP^8. Boston College (16)7. Charlotte (11)6. Middle Tennessee (8)\nUMassively badUMass entered the 2025 campaign with just eight victories over the past six seasons, but the 2025 Minutemen are setting a new program standard for futility. They have been outscored 194-32 in five games (all losses) against FBS teams. Their one game against an FCS foe? That was a 27-26 loss to Bryant, which is a bad FCS team whose only other victory to date is against Division II Bentley University. Being this bad is actually kind of impressive.5.

    "body": "\n        Sometimes, in sports especially, it's difficult to parse perception and reality as personal biases muddy the waters and educated opinions of respected individuals may even sway stances like a limber tree in the night breeze. Actions being witnessed may not reveal all the necessary facts, while the data on paper may not tell a full story.In Xander Schauffele's case, the perception and the reality of his 2025 season aligned perfectly. By all accounts, it was a lost year for the No. 4-ranked golfer in the world -- one without an ounce of contention nor a memorable moment -- a season he would rue given its timing amid the prime of his career.That is until Schauffele started to flip the script -- page by page -- beginning at the Ryder Cup and culminating at last weekend's Baycurrent Classic in Japan where he entered the winner's circle for the first time since raising the Claret Jug in 2024. Schauffele discovered what was lost, and in the process, changed both the reality and the perception of his 2025 campaign.\"I thought at the Ryder Cup I played pretty solid. I left [Patrick Cantlay] hanging in our second alternate shot match or foursomes match; I played really poor there and let him down. But the other rounds, I felt like I was starting to kind of play some good golf,\" he said. \"It's very high stakes, high-pressure golf, and I started to hit some shots that I wasn't really hitting throughout the year. I think the whole tournament, even though we lost, for me personally I was able to hit a few shots in high stakes moments that sort of gave me a little bit of confidence for sure.\"\nFollowing a campaign that took him from being perceived as good player (2023) to the most well-rounded player in the world (2024), Schauffele was the only player to finish that latter season inside the top 25 in all four strokes-gained categories. He was seen as a competitor capable of putting together a ferocious encore in 2025, even amid the dominating noise from world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler. Schauffele entered the new year with the longest made cut streak on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods' run of 142, standing as the reigning major champion at two separate tournaments. Long heralded as Mr. Consistent, the 31-year-old's game was showing off the vaulted ceilings to go along with the hardwood floors. But Schauffele never got up for the show. After opening the year playing in the PGA Tour's first tournament of 2025, the smooth-swinging right hander missed the rest of January and all of February due to an intercostal strain and a small cartilage tear in his rib.\nThe only remedy was rest, rehab and patience -- the latter coincidentally became the theme of his season.When he did return inside the ropes, Schauffele struggled relative to the high standards he set for himself. His first top-10 finish of the season came at the Masters, and inconsistencies in his game appeared both off the tee (where he wrestled on and off with a new driver) and on the greens (where he was lethal the year prior).Xander Schauffele entering Baycurrent ClassicCareer rank out of nine PGA Tour seasons2024 (Rank)2025 (Rank)Starts23 (5th)15 (9th)Wins2 (2nd)0Top 5s10 (1st)0 (9th)Top 20s19 (1st)7 (9th)Total strokes gained+2.58 (1st)+1.29 (7th)Strokes gained off the tee+0.67 (2nd)+0.33 (8th)Strokes gained approach+0.95 (2nd)+0.84 (4th)Strokes gained around the green+0.38 (1st)+0.10 (6th)Strokes gained putting+0.66 (2nd)+0.02 (9th)The results on paper improved as the year progressed -- Schauffele added top 10s at the Scottish Open and The Open -- but he was, frankly, an afterthought in those tournaments. He finished 42nd in the FedEx Cup standings, missed the Tour Championship for the first time in his career and stood in jeopardy of failing to log a top-five finish for the first time in his PGA Tour career.Then he showed up at Bethpage Black, and a renewed energy engulfed the Californian. Not seen since the BMW Championship due to the birth of his first son, Schauffele was in full-grind mode, particularly on the practice putting greens. Assuring himself of start lines over and again, he became a fixture there before the event kicked off.Schauffele hit the fifth fewest amount of range balls from Monday through Thursday of the 24 players at the Ryder Cup. Instead, he searched for answers with the putter. While not all of them surfaced, enough did that he was able to compile a 3-1-0 record -- tied for the best on the United States team.The confidence carried over to Japan last weekend where he started the Baycurrent Classic as the betting favorite. A hard-fought 71 came amid difficult conditions in Round 1 before he played his final 54 holes in 19 under to skirt past Max Greyserman and Michael Thorbjornsen in the final group.\"I was plenty nervous. It's been over a year since I was even looking at winning a golf tournament,\" Schauffele said. \"I was probably just as nervous or more nervous as they were just because I knew I've done it before and I had to dig kind of deep in my memory to do it again.\"The win changes only so much of the reality from Schauffele's season. The skinny is that he picked up one win and one top five, enjoyed a solid Ryder Cup performance and extended his made cut streak to 72 tournaments. Schauffele notched three top-12 finishes in the major championships, too.What it did accomplish, however, was altering the perception, especially in Schauffele's mind where it matters most. His season ended with his game not lost but found, suddenly memorable and inspiring rather than forgettable and disappointing. Schauffele's 2025 was not smooth sailing by any means, but from the storm he emerged with his game and inner belief in tow.\"I was confident, [but] I definitely had doubts,\" Schauffele said. \"I think every player in any sport, at some point in time, you feel like you're on top of the world and then you feel like, not that you've lost it, but you feel less confident. I have a really good team around me, they pick me up when I'm down. \"This is really special for me. Sooner than I thought, to be fair. I was running out of events in 2025 to sort of put my mark on it. I'm sure, when I look back on 2025 at the end of my career, I'll smile and think it was a great year.\"\n            ",

The Aggies have had 12 days to prep for this one coming off a 37-10 win over Sam Houston on Oct. 2, but the Liberty defense could make life tough on a New Mexico State offense that hasn't topped 350 yards yet this season. The Flames held UTEP to 167 yards of offense last week. Now the model is projecting that Liberty covers in 59% of simulations.

Meanwhile, FIU is 2-3 on the season and and has won 15 games combined since the start of 2020. One of those wins came against FCS Bethune-Cookman and all three of the losses were by 24 points or more. Both teams are coming off a bye and that likely favors the home team, with the model predicting that Western Kentucky covers in 60% of simulations.

The Brewers can draw confidence from their previous success, even if the sample size is small,\" SportsLine handicapper Jeff Hochman said. \"Freddy Peralta has limited the Dodgers to a .293 xwOBA in 154 plate appearances. He has been more effective at home with a 1.77 ERA compared to a 3.71 ERA on the road this season. I like the Brewers to win at plus money.\" Bet it at Caesars, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the promo code CBS20X:More MLB best betsEvery MLB game simulated 10,000 timesBrewers vs.

The over/under signals expectations of a high-scoring game. Historically, Baltimore has had strong success vs. NFC opponents - Lamar Jackson in particular holds a superb record against NFC teams. Meanwhile, Detroit is showing good ATS (against the spread) numbers in road games since 2023, which suggests they might be competitive even as underdogs. Some bettors may believe Detroit could cover the spread based on their recent offensive outburst against Chicago and the idea that Baltimore's defense is vulnerable in certain areas due to injuries to players like LB Kyle Van Noy and DT Nnamdi Madubuike. 55-60% of betting tickets are on the Ravens to cover at sportsbooks with more than 70% of total tickets on the over. More than 70% of moneyline wagers are also on the Ravens. Pro football on Monday night betting sites and promosFootball on Monday night is always one of the most eagerly game broadcasts of the week, so some of the best promos from online sportsbooks often coincide with the matchup.

    "body": "\n        Every big-time school with a football opening is going to be interested in Curt Cignetti.Indiana made the best coaching hire this decade when it plucked a 62-year-old out of James Madison. The son of a coach, Cignetti took the long, hard path to coaching stardom. To casual fans, he might seem like an overnight sensation, but he grinded his way up the ladder to now leading the No. 3 team in the country. He's the best story in college football. Predictably, his name has already been prominently mentioned with the Penn State opening. If other big jobs like Florida, Auburn and Wisconsin open up, he'll get mentioned for those, too. It seems to be as much about Cignetti's ability as the notion that, of course, a football blue blood would be able to coach steal from Indiana. That outdated thinking would be ignoring what Indiana has done to give Cignetti the necessary resources to maintain a sustainable winner. \nWhat Cignetti decides to do with the attractive options that will come in spades at the end of the season is up to him, but Indiana has smartly done everything it could in less than two years to show he doesn't have to leave to win big. Let's start with the fact Cignetti already makes $8.3 million annually before bonuses, will receive a $1 million retention bonus in November and will surely get another raise in the coming months. This after the school already doubled his salary in less than a year on the job. Indiana is committed to making sure Cignetti is very, very well compensated to be its football coach. It doesn't stop at just the head coach level, either. Indiana stepped up to keep defensive coordinator Bryant Haines and strength and conditioning coach Derek Owings, fending off top Big Ten programs to hold on to both. In his recent contract, Indiana gave Cignetti $11 million for his assistant coach and support staff salary pool, one of the top in the country and nearly double what he got when he started in Bloomington. \n\"We were committed to provide the resources to keep the coaches that we can intact and make sure we have that continuity,\" Indiana AD Scott Dolson told CBS Sports before the season. \"It's really, really important to the future for that consistent success to keep the staff intact and keep executing the plan the best we can.\"Keeping Owings, Haines and others has certainly paid off so far. The Hoosiers are rolling at 6-0 and coming off a top-five road win over then-No. 3 Oregon, their first in program history. If Indiana can continue to hold on to top lieutenants plus attract high-quality talent like quarterback Fernando Mendoza, why does Cignetti have to leave?He's already proven he can take Indiana to the College Football Playoff as he did a year ago. The Hoosiers are well on their way to repeating that feat this season and could even get a first-round bye or, at least, a home playoff game at this pace. Cignetti has invigorated a traditional basketball school to care about football, and his stunning results have elicited more donations, ticket sales and support that make it all feel like much more than a flash in the pan.\nEven billionaire Mark Cuban is getting involved now. \"I gave some to sports this year for the first time ever,\" Cuban told CBS Sports' Richard Johnson last week. \"Typically, I was the exact opposite. I'm not a fan of anything that I believe raises tuition in the least bit. But after getting to talk to Cig and seeing what was going on, they kinda talked me into it.\"Cuban, an Indiana alumnus, wouldn't say the exact amount he gave but admitted it was a \"big number.\" Pulling in wealthy benefactors like Cuban is how you keep the momentum rolling. Cignetti, now 64, is starting to enter the legacy phase of his career. If he stays at Indiana, he has a chance to be the kind of transformational leader you build a statue for once it's all over. What he's done in less than two years at Indiana is nothing short of remarkable and makes it easy to see why so many other programs would be interested in him. \nCould he crush it at Penn State or Florida? Absolutely, either of those schools would be lucky to have him. There's something about Cignetti's chip-on-the-shoulder, hard work wins out mentality that just feels right at a place like Indiana.  But this is a guy who took a pay cut to leave a burgeoning Alabama dynasty as a Nick Saban assistant to take over Division-II Indiana University of Pennsylvania. A guy who worked his way from IUP to Elon to James Madison before finally getting his first Power Four job opportunity in his 60s. He's not driven by fame or prestige, he just wants to win. You don't have to Google him to know that anymore. \"Beyond the money part of it, which is obviously a major factor, I think he really is a perfect fit here,\" Dolson told CBS Sports. \"I think he's a perfect fit for us, but I think at the same time, we're a perfect fit for him. Those are his words, not mine. But he talks a lot about our alignment, he's extremely close with our president Pam Whitten. She understands and supports the entire department, but understands and supports football which is massive.\"\nThere almost certainly will be other university presidents and athletic directors promising the world to Cignetti in the coming months. And, certainly, some of those programs can sell a more storied program history and more fertile recruiting base than what Cignetti has in Bloomington. But when Cignetti agreed to an eight-year contract extension last year, he explained why he didn't care about what other jobs might open up in the coaching cycle. \"We're the emerging superpower of college football,\" Cignetti said. \"Why would I leave?\"\nThat statement is even more true a year later. With the transfer portal, NIL and now revenue sharing, there is more parity in college football than ever before. It has allowed schools like Indiana to rise up behind the right coach and right group of players to a level that would have seemed incomprehensible even a decade ago. As long as Indiana can keep up from an NIL and rev-share standpoint, we've seen what Cignetti and his elite staff can do in developing and coaching them into winners. Cignetti doesn't have to leave Indiana to reach the elite level of college football. He's already there now. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        John Harbaugh and the Ravens are trying to do something only four teams have accomplished since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger in 1970: reach the playoffs after starting the season 1-5. Sunday's loss to the Rams was rock bottom for the AFC franchise accustomed to winning. Offensive deficiencies were magnified due in large part to the team being without two-time MVP Lamar Jackson each of the last two games with a hamstring issue.\"Our focus is going forward and what we can accomplish for the next 11 games to try to earn our way into the playoffs, which obviously, as [it was] pointed out last night, has not been done very often with the record we have; but, we still believe we can do it,\" Harbaugh said Monday.Baltimore expects Jackson to return in Week 8 after its bye week and he's going to be expected to be Superman of sorts to pick up the team while they're down.Jackson has thrown for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns and one interception in four starts and was terrific in the Ravens' lone win, a four-touchdown outing against the Browns in Week 2.\n\"If I was on the couch with a psychiatrist right now, if I was spilling it, I would have to say I'm leaning really hard into that, really hard,\" Harbaugh said. \"For any kind of psychological wellbeing, spiritual wellbeing, I'm leaning hard on that happening. So, I'm very hopeful that that happens.\"Despite the surprisingly disastrous start to the season for one of the AFC's perceived contenders coming in, Harbaugh is still managing the team as he normally would and hasn't changed the process, he says.It's hard to expect otherwise for a coach who's led this franchise to the postseason six times in the last seven years with four AFC North titles during that stretch.\n\"I think what I really try to be intentional about is continuing to respect people and to treat people the right way on our team, in the building, and our coaching staff who are giving everything they've got every single day to be the very best they can be,\" Harbaugh said.Baltimore's defense has taken a step back this season, allowing 32.3 points per game, which ranks 29th in the NFL. However, too many empty possessions offensively goes into that, specifically the last two weeks where the Ravens have scored a total of 13 points with Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley at the helm.Derrick Henry's second 100-yard game of the season against the Rams is a promising sign given his early fumbling issues and Baltimore's obvious reluctancy in recent weeks to call his number. But this team's not going to have a chance to get back on the right foot until Jackson's return and he'll need to be nearly unstoppable down the stretch to turn the tides of a tumultuous campaign.\n            ",

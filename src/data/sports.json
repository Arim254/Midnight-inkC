    "body": "\n        Lindsey Vonn's preparations for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics took a troubling turn Friday when the American star crashed during the final World Cup downhill before the Games and was airlifted from the course for medical evaluation with a left knee injury.Vonn, 41, lost control after landing a jump on the upper portion of the course in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, spinning into the safety netting amid snowfall and low visibility. She was the sixth skier to start in the race, which had already seen multiple crashes before her run.\nAfter receiving medical attention on the slope, Vonn was able to stand and slowly ski down to the finish area, but she was favoring her left knee and using her poles for support. She stopped several times on the descent and appeared in visible discomfort. The race was later canceled following the series of crashes.Vonn's status for the Olympics is unclear and she said she will undergo further exams on her knee.\n\"I crashed today in the downhill race in Switzerland and injured my left knee,\" Vonn wrote on Instagram. \"I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams. This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics, but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over. Thank you for all of the love and support. I will give more information when I have it. Thank you to all the medical staff who helped me today. I am grateful for all the incredible help I received.\"At the bottom of the course, Vonn embraced teammate Jacqueline Wiles before limping into a medical tent. She was then airlifted by helicopter from the venue, a common procedure at mountain races, with the U.S. Ski Team confirming on social media that Vonn was being evaluated.\"She has some pain so it's better to have some checks,\" Aksel Lund Svindal, the two-time Olympic champion who is part of Vonn's coaching team, told Reuters. \"The physio did some checks, they seemed OK, but there were things he was not 100% sure so it was good to have it checked (at the hospital).\"The crash comes exactly one week before the opening ceremony of the Milan Cortina Games, where Vonn is expected to be one of the sport's biggest stars. Her first scheduled Olympic event is the women's downhill two days after the ceremony, with plans to also compete in super-G and the team combined event.Vonn's comeback has been one of the most remarkable stories in skiing. After retiring in 2019 due to the physical toll of repeated injuries, she returned to competition following a partial right knee replacement in April 2024. Now skiing with a titanium implant, she has dominated the downhill circuit this season with two wins and podium finishes in every race, leading the discipline standings.\nCortina d'Ampezzo, the Olympic venue for women's alpine skiing, is also one of Vonn's most successful stops, where she earned 12 of her 84 career World Cup victories.Friday's crash, however, adds uncertainty to her Olympic outlook. Vonn has endured major injuries before, including a devastating knee injury at the 2013 world championships that forced her to miss the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n            ",

Seattle loss its opener to San Francisco and fell to 3-2 after a Week 5 loss to Tampa Bay, but ripped off wins in 13 of the next 14 wins to earn its way into the Big Game. Meanwhile, New England lost two of its first three but has won 16 of its last 17.Sam Darnold and Drake Maye both looked like NFL MVP candidates at points throughout the season, though they'll likely fall short to Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Darnold has rejuvenated his career by throwing 60 touchdown passes in the last two seasons and Maye became the youngest player in NFL history to lead the league in completion percentage (72.0%).Both teams were top five in the NFL in scoring offense and scoring defense and the SportsLine Projection Model is predicting thin margins against the spread and with the over/under. It's slightly leaning towards Seattle to cover against the spread based on the percentages and also projects that the Under hits in 59% of its 10,000 simulations of the Big Game.Exact score prediction: Seattle Seahawks 24, New England Patriots 20 (best odds +15000 at BetMGM):Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        UFC 325 will see the promotion head Down Under as the star-studded event takes place from Sydney, Australia on Saturday. The main card begins at 9 p.m. ET and will stream on Paramount+, with Qudos Bank Arena playing host. Many UFC 325 bets will center on the main event of Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2, which is a featherweight championship rematch. Reigning two-time champion Alexander Volkanovski (27-4) will look for another victory over challenger, Diego Lopes (27-7), after the former prevailed via decision at UFC 314 last April.The latest UFC 325 odds have Volkanovski as the -148 favorite (risk $148 to win $100) as the Aussie will have the backing of the home crowd. Lopes, who is the No. 2 ranked featherweight, comes in at +124 (risk $100 to win $124). The co-main event is a lightweight battle between No. 6 Dan Hooker (+250) and No. 8 Benoit Saint-Denis (-310). Before locking in any UFC 325 picks, make sure you see the MMA predictions and betting advice from Mike McClure's proven computer model.New users wanting to bet on UFC 325 can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:McClure's UFC model runs 10,000 simulations for every fight. Each simulation plays out the fight round-by-round, accounting for dynamic win probability that shifts based on fighter attributes, round-by-round finish calculations with KO/submission timing, accumulating damage factors that increase finish likelihood in later rounds and fighter-specific finishing tendencies such as power punchers vs grapplers vs decision fighters.\nThe model backtested against more than 500 fights from 2023-25 and showed more than 18 units of profit — a 6.1% ROI on UFC betting. It also got off to a hot start for the new era of UFC on Paramount+, hitting both Justin Gaethe to win outright (+195) and the Over in total rounds in the main event at UFC 324.Now, the model has analyzed Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2               from every angle and revealed its top betting picks and best bets.

He was honored by topping the promotion's pound-for-pound rankings in both 2022 and 2023, and at one point he had an 11-fight win streak within the featherweight division. While he has just a 2-3 record over his last five bouts, two of those came when Volkanovski stepped up in weight class and challenged Islam Makhachev for the UFC Lightweight Championship, losing both bouts to Makhachev.The other defeat saw the Aussie drop the featherweight title to Ilia Topuria in Feb. 2024. However, he then won the vacant UFC Featherweight Championship in his next bout, which was the first match with Lopes. Volkanovski won via unanimous decision as he landed more than twice as many significant strikes (158) than his opponent landed total strikes (71). That was the 11th decision victory of Volkanovski's MMA career, as he also has 13 KOs and three submission triumphs. Check out SportsLine to see the model's picks and analysis.The 31-year-old Lopes has youth on his side versus Volkanovski, in addition to five inches over his 5-foot-6 opponent. A native of Brazil, Lopes has a BJJ background and signed with UFC in 2023. After dropping his first fight, he then went on a five-bout winning streak, earning Performance of the Night twice during that span. That led to his first title shot versus Volkanovski at UFC 314 in April 2025, and though the Brazilian came up short, the bout was awarded Fight of the Night.\nWhile Volkanovski has been idle since then, Lopes took a fight against Jean Silva, a fellow Brazilian who was ranked and had recorded five straight finish victories. Lopes prevailed in that September 2025 bout via TKO with a spinning elbow and punches. That was his 11th knockout victory, to go along with 12 submissions and four wins via decision. Neither Lopes nor Volkanovski have ever lost via submission, though both have tasted defeat by knockout and on the scorecards. You can only see the model's UFC 325 picks and analysis at SportsLine. UFC 325: Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2   predictionsOne of the model's top UFC 325 picks: It is backing Mauricio Ruffy at -120 (+6.0% edge) against Rafael Fiziev. \"From a stylistic perspective, this is a clash between Ruffy, who profiles as a technical fighter, and Fiziev, who operates primarily as a power striker,\" McClure said. \"There's a reasonable chance we see a finish here -- our model projects a 57% stoppage rate with knockout or TKO being the most common method at 47%. This is a modest edge on the favorite, but playable at this price. The model sees Ruffy as slightly more likely to win than the market suggests.\" See who else to back here. \nYou can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 325: Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2   picksThe model has strong picks for Volkanovski vs. Lopes 2   and other bouts on the UFC 325 card.

He averaged 11.3 points per game over those contests, and the 22-year-old is averaging 15.8 ppg this season. The Magic play the Raptors, who are sixth in the league in scoring defense at 112.1 ppg allowed. Black has elevated his game after averaging 4.6 and 9.4 points over his first two seasons, but the model still views this as too high a number against Toronto. The model projects Black for 13.5 points on Friday. DraftKings offers the best odds, while other sportsbooks have him priced at -125 odds or shorter or have moved his over/under down to 15.5 points. Bet on Black with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Deni Avdija, Trail Blazers, Under 22.5 points (-105)He's gone Under this number in back-to-back games, including scoring 17 points over 31 minutes against the Wizards on Tuesday, and Washington has one of the worst defenses in the NBA. Avdija and the Trail Blazers have a significantly tougher matchup on Friday against the Knicks, who are eighth in scoring defense at 112.8 ppg allowed this season. The Knicks have held their opponents to fewer than 95 points in three of their last four games, which is a key reason why the model has the Portland forward projected for 20.8 points on Friday. Avdija has been battling a lower-back strain in recent weeks, but the only games he's missed over the last two weeks have involved back-to-backs, which increases his chances of playing on Friday. But the injury could limit his scoring. \nBet on Avdija with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Domantas Sabonis, Kings, Over 28.5 points + rebounds + assists (-124)Sabonis has gone Over this number in two of his last four games, while having a PRA of at least 24 in each of the last four contests to consistently finish Over to near this mark. He's been one of the most versatile offensive players in the league, averaging at least 19 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in each of his first three full seasons with the Kings. Even while battling injuries this season, he's still averaging a PRA total of 30.8 heading into a matchup against a Celtics team likely without Jaylen Brown (doubtful, hamstring/knee). The model projects a 32.1 PRA total for Sabonis on Friday. Bet on Sabonis with the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBSSPORTS250BM for a first bet match up to a $250 bonus bet whether your bet wins or loses for new users: \nWant more Friday NBA picks?You've seen the model's NBA picks for some popular NBA player props for Friday.

    "body": "\nThe matchup for Super Bowl LX is set, with the New England Patriots taking on the Seattle Seahawks. For the first time in the history of The Big Game, each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup. New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX.Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Seahawks are 11-9 all-time versus New England.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points. It also says one side of the spread is the better value. You can only get the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Seahawks vs. Patriots, and which side of the Super Bowl spread is the better value?

    "body": "\n        It's time to kick off one of the best times of year for wrestling fans. The Road to WrestleMania gets underway on Saturday night in Saudi Arabia when WWE takes the Royal Rumble to Riyadh. One of the promotion's tentpole events, the Royal Rumble began running annually in 1988. It presents the 30 participants with the opportunity to be in a championship match at WrestleMania. Last year saw an incredible bit of theater in the men's match as it came down to Jey Uso and John Cena, who was participating in his final Royal Rumble amid his retirement tour. Uso managed to finish things off by tossing Cena over the top rope and he capped it off by besting Gunther for the world heavyweight title in April.While there are some superstars who have declared their entry into the over-the-top-rope elimination match, there's always a handful of surprises fans don't see coming between both the men's and women's matches.Two other matches are booked for the cornerstone event. Undisputed WWE champion McIntyre makes his first title defense against Sami Zayn, who won a tournament to earn the title shot. Also on the card, Gunther attempts to retire AJ Styles.\n        \n            \n                WWE burning questions for the Road to WrestleMania 42: Who wins the Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber and more\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTake a look below at the confirmed matches for the Royal Rumble as well as our staff picks and predictions for each match. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited with the main card starting at 2 p.m. ET.\n2026 WWE Royal Rumble matchesMen's Royal  Rumble match -- Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, Gunther, Jey Uso, Rey Mysterio, Jacob Fatu, Solo Sikoa, Dragon Lee, Penta, Bron Breakker, Logan Paul, Bronson Reed, Austin Theory, Je'Von Evans, Oba Femi, Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar and 13 more: The match already has a who's who of entrants that we know. There's five surefire Hall of Famers, former world champions and plenty of upstart talent set to participate. Be on the look out for The Vision and the four members who are set to enter. They could pose a united front and take out much of the field.Undisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: McIntyre learned the identity of his first title challenger at Saturday Night's Main Event. Randy Orton, Trick Williams, Damian Priest and Zayn met in a No. 1 contender's match after winning their qualifying matches. Zayn stood tall in Montreal, catching Priest with a Helluva Kick to punch his ticket to the Rumble. Zayn has never won a world title in WWE, and has made it his mission to change his fortunes this year.Women's Royal Rumble match -- Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, Roxanne Perez, Liv Morgan, Raquel Rodriguez, Bayley, Lyra Valkyria, Asuka, Chelsea Green, Jordynne Grace, Charlotte Flair, Alexa Bliss, Nia Jax, Lash Legend, Giulia, Maxxine Dupri, Becky Lynch and 13 more: The women's Rumble is stacked. Eight former women's world champions are among the 15 superstars currently announced for the match. Expect more stars to throw their names into the hat before the Rumble begins.\nAJ Styles vs. Gunther: Gunther is turning into a new age Legend Killer. Last year, \"The Ring General\" retired both John Cena and Goldberg. He wants to do the same to Styles. \"The Phenomenal\" one previously announced he'd retire in 2026, but Gunther hopes to expedite the process. Gunther stole a victory from Styles on Monday Night Raw, and only granted him a rematch under the condition that Styles retires if he loses at the Rumble.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the second time in eight days, the UFC will present a numbered event on Saturday as UFC 325 touches down in Sydney, Australia, for an exciting card emanating from Qudos Bank Arena. Native son Alexander Volkanovski will make his fifth UFC appearance on Australian soil when he defends his featherweight title in the main event in a rematch against Diego Lopes. All-action lightweights Dan Hooker and Benoit Saint Denis will lock horns in a much-anticipated co-feature fight. As we draw closer to the UFC's eighth visit to Sydney in company history, let's take a closer look at the biggest storylines surrounding the event. Sign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 325: Fight card, date, odds as Alexander Volkanovski takes on Diego Lopes in Australia\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n1. How much longer can Alexander Volkanovski stay on top? At 37, the two-time featherweight champion is considered by many as the greatest 145-pound fighter in UFC history thanks to victories over Chad Mendes, Jose Aldo, Max Holloway (three times), Brian Ortega and Yair Rodriguez. And his hard-fought decision win over Lopes last August at UFC 314 awarded Volkanovski the vacant title and a bit of much-needed resurgence following consecutive knockout losses and a skid of three defeats in four fights. Granted, those defeats all came against the current top two fighters in the world (Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria) and two of those came at lightweight. But with Topuria having moved up to 155 pounds, Volkanovski remains the class of the division and sits just two title defenses away from equaling the UFC featherweight record of seven by Aldo. Few fighters have maintained their elite status in the smaller weight classes this deep into their careers and Volkanovski appears as if he still has enough left to add a few more accomplishments to his Hall-of-fame resume entering the Lopes rematch. Even though Volkanovski was dropped in Round 4 of their first fight and visibly hurt twice, he bent but never broke.Watch the first meeting between Volkanovski and Lopes on Paramount+ for as little as $8.99 per month2. Expect a more calculated and dangerous Lopes in the rematchWhen Lopes, a 31-year-old native of Brazil who fights out of Mexico, faced off with Volkanovski in their first meeting last April, it marked his first time in the UFC competing for a title and fighting the five-round championship distance. Ultimately, his inexperience showed as Lopes now admits he completely abandoned his gameplan off the start and found himself desperately searching for a knockout that wasn't to be. One will never confuse Lopes with a technical master like Volkanovski. It's his aggressiveness and fighting spirit that will likely forever be his true calling card. But a more refined and patient Lopes will almost certainly be a more dangerous one on Saturday. And one can expect Lopes to be buoyed by a strong performance in September at Noche UFC when he survived a wild duel with Jean Silva by using his grappling skills early before patiently setting Silva up for what became the finishing blow on a spinning back elbow. In between, Lopes showed his trademark chin and durability in a crazy fight. Should Lopes bring a similarly smart and calculated strategy into the rematch with Volkanovski, it isn't out of the question for him to build upon the success he had late in their first fight and pull a resounding upset to commandeer control of the division. \n3. A refocused Benoit Saint Denis is a legit threat to the lightweight titleIt may have taken two stoppage defeats in 2024 for the former French Army Special Forces soldier to seek a much-needed change after absorbing tremendous punishment against Dustin Poirier and Renato Moicano, but the rejuvenated BSD appears to be a new man. Saint Denis switched gyms and now fights under the tutelage of French trainer Nicholas Ott, who also works with middleweight contender Nassourdine Imavov. And the change in both tactics and mindset have done wonders for Saint Denis without muting any of the danger that he brings to the table. Under Ott, BSD is now riding a three-fight win streak following stoppages of Kyle Prepolec, Mauricio Ruffy and Beneil Dariush. In fact, all eight of his UFC wins have come via finish, with his UFC debut loss to Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos in 2021 marking the only time in BSD's 20-fight pro career that the judges were needed. Saint Denis returns Saturday against Dan Hooker in a fight that all but guarantees action and carnage. But the sizable betting favorite BSD, who enters as the No. 8-ranked lightweight, has an opportunity with a win to move within striking distance of the title. 4. It might be win or go home for lovable heavyweight Tai TuivasaDespite still being just 32, which is young for a heavyweight, it's difficult to deny just how much Tuivasa, the hard-charging brawler known for his celebratory shoey beer chugs, could be fighting for his job on Saturday. The native of Sydney will not only snap a 17-month layoff when he faces 6-foot-8 Brazilian slugger Tallison Teixeira, \"Bam Bam\" will be looking to snap a five-fight losing skid which includes four losses by stoppage. Tuivasa has never hidden the fact that fitness and training typically take a backseat to his love of partying but it's time to take his career more seriously before it's over. Tuivasa once won five straight fights -- all by knockout -- from 2020 to 2022 to become a surprising darkhorse title contender. His quick and heavy hands, mixed with his iron will, have made for a number of memorable performances for the crowd favorite who could certainly use a big one this weekend.5. Don't sleep on a pair of lightweight bouts that round out the main cardThe co-main event of Hooker-Saint Denis isn't the only 155-pound bout worth making some time for this weekend. Of the five bouts on the main card, three of them will be contested at lightweight, with a matchup between No. 9 Rafael Fiziev and No. 14 Mauricio Ruffy having all the potential to be a sleep action fight. Fiziev, who has battled injuries in recent years, snapped a three-fight losing skid (which included two decision losses to interim champion Justin Gaethje) by outpointing Ignacio Bahamondes last June. Ruffy, meanwhile, saw his red-hot start of three dynamic wins to open his UFC run get humbled in a big way at the hands of Saint Denis in September when BSD exposed Ruffy's wrestling vulnerabilities in a submission defeat. With lightweight in the midst of major turnover, look for the combination of urgency and desperation to create nothing but fireworks. And don't miss out on the continued rise of Australian prospect Quillan Salkilld, who opens the main card against veteran countryman Jamie Mullarkey. Salkilld may not be getting the same attention as middleweight Ateba Gautier following his breakout 2025 campaign, but three big wins to start his UFC run and a stunning head-kick knockout of Nasrat Haqparast have many taking notice. The 25-year-old Salkilld is 10-1 as a pro and is a heavy favorite to hand Mullarkey his fourth loss in his last six fights.\nWho wins Volkanovski vs. Lopes, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

But an honest Lopes, who still managed to drop Volkanovski, admitted after the fight that he failed to follow his corner's gameplan and got caught simply following his opponent around in hopes of a knockout. Expect a more seasoned and more dangerous Lopes in the rematch. Not only did he rely on grappling and the traps he set with striking to ultimately finish Jean Silva last September, he has been working relentlessly on rounding out his game. If Lopes does a better job cutting off the cage and using both his size and the threat of the takedown to make the 37-year-old Volkanovski feel his age, this should be a very different fight. And while Volkanovski's chin did hold up during their first fight despite having been fresh off of back-to-back knockout losses, his time at the top may be running out. Lopes via TKO3\nBrookhouse: It's hard to believe that this fight plays out much differently than the first fight unless Volkanovski has aged considerably in the past year. Yes, 37 is old for a fighter, especially a featherweight, but Volkanovski is a uniquely skilled tactician in his ability to not only prepare, but execute a gameplan. I don't see any reason to think that losses to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria signal a fighter is \"done\" at an elite level, simply that he ran into two of the best fighters on the planet in their prime. Lopes doesn't have a reliable takedown game, which means that this is a striking battle, and Volkanovski is great at working angles and finding timing. Yes, Lopes did hurt Volkanovski in the first fight, but that came in between Volkanovski clearly controlling the rest of the action. I simply don't believe that Lopes can out-gameplan and outexecute Volkanovski. Volkanovski via UDMahjouri: Volkanovski via UDMormile: Volkanovski UDWise: Volkanovski via UDDan Hooker vs. Benoit Saint Denis predictionsCampbell: Reformed following a pair of TKO defeats, Saint Denis has looked like a completely different fighter in three walks to the Octagon under the tutelage of new coach Nicholas Ott, which produced a trio of stoppage wins in 2025. The task at hand against Hooker on Saturday will be for 'BSD' to ignore the urge to throw caution to the wind off the start and get into a full-blown slugfest. Saint Denis is at his best when he balances patience and grappling with the threat of his powerful striking. And considering Hooker was finished in less than two rounds by Arman Tsarukyan just two months ago, this could be the perfect catapult for the French \"God of War\" to score a systematic stoppage victory and enter the top five at 155 pounds. Hooker is always game for battle, but his one-dimensional style has caught up with him on the elite level. Saint Denis via KO2Brookhouse: Saint Denis via SUB2Mahjouri: Hooker has no designs on changing his style. He's hell-bent on action, and it'll cost him against on Saturday. Neither man has perfect durability, but Hooker has more wear and tear. That's concerning against Saint Denis, the younger and arguably more powerful fighter. Saint Denis looks revitalized working with top middleweight contender Nassourine Imavov. The French special forces soldier has the natural gifts and evolving skillset to make short work of Hooker. It's imperative, however, that he doesn't abandon his defense. Hooker can still crack and will catch Saint Denis if he's not careful. Saint Denis via KO2\nMormile: Saint Denis via submissionWise: Saint Denis via TKO3Rafael Fiziev vs. Mauricio Ruffy predictionsCampbell: Ruffy via UDBrookhouse: If anyone can add wrestling threats to this fight, it's Fiziev. Ruffy has never scored a takedown in the UFC and he was taken down three times while being dominated by Saint Denis. Fiziev, meanwhile, has scored six takedowns in his two most recent fights, including two against Justin Gaethje. In a fairly even battle of strikers, though Ruffy may be a bit more dynamic in his angles and shot selection, one fighter having the edge in grappling is enough to tilt the fight on paper. While either man could catch the other on the feet, Fiziev's new confidence in his wrestling gives me some comfort in siding with him. Fiziev via UDMahjouri: This might be an even more compelling action fight than the co-main event. Fiziev and Ruffy are on the cusp of entering the lightweight elite. Fiziev is a first-class Muay Thai striker with an improving wrestling game. Ruffy, a textbook KO artist, recently migrated from the Fighting Nerds to featherweight champ Volkanovski's camp. I was prepared to count Fiziev out, but I think he's a victim of bad luck. His three UFC losses are a majority decision to Justin Gaethje, a freak knee injury against Mateusz Gamrot and a close rematch against Gaethje, which he took on two weeks' notice after a year-and-a-half layoff from the aforementioned injury. Fiziev showed signs of life in a bounce-back win against Ignacio Bahamondes, complementing his striking with newfound wrestling. Ruffy might revolutionize himself with Team Volkanovski, but I'll need to see the results before assessing his future. Fiziev via UDMormile: Fiziev via UDWise: Fiziev via UD\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest games during the conference play portion of the 2025-26 college basketball season will take place in East Lansing, Michigan, when No. 7 Michigan State faces No. 3 Michigan on Friday. This is the 197th all-time meeting between the programs, with Michigan leading the series over its in-state rival, 104-92.Michigan State has won the last four meetings against Michigan, and the Wolverines' last win over the Spartans at the Breslin Center came in 2018.The Wolverines are coming off a dramatic 75-72 win over Nebraska at home, which marked the Cornhuskers' first loss of the season. Michigan has won its last five games since losing to Wisconsin at home. The Spartans' lone loss in Big Ten play came against Nebraska on the road earlier this month. Since that game, the Spartans have fired off seven consecutive victories to move to 9-1 in Big Ten play.Here is everything you need to know ahead of Michigan's matchup with Michigan State on Friday.\nMichigan vs. Michigan State: Need to knowWolverine bigs vs. the Spartans is the matchup to watch: The staple of Dusty May's tenure at Michigan has been using two bigs. Last year, May deployed Danny Wolf and Vlad Goldin on the front line. This year, Michigan has been running Yaxel Lendeborg, Morez Johnson Jr. and Aday Mara in the frontcourt. That can be a matchup nightmare for opponents. Facing the Wolverines physical and elite front court will be Michigan State's No. 1-ranked defense in adjusted efficiency, per KenPom.com. Spartan bigs Jaxson Kohler and Carson Cooper will face their toughest matchup yet.Michigan State seeks best start in program history: With a win over Michigan, the Spartans would move to 20-2. That would mark the best 22-game start in program history. Michigan State's losses this season have both come against top 10 teams. Michigan State lost at home last month against No. 4 Duke (66-60) and fell to Nebraska on the road (58-56). That historic start was almost put in jeopardy earlier this week when MSU had to rally to defeat Rutgers 88-79 in overtime. In that game, Michigan State trailed for almost 36 minutes of regulation.Winner takes control of the Big Ten race: With Nebraska, Michigan, Michigan State and Illinois all with just one loss against Big Ten competition, the winner of Friday night's game will move into sole possession of first place in the conference. While both of these teams are set to meet again later this season, this game will have huge implications for who wins the conference. Notably, Michigan State and Michigan both face Illinois again this season.\nWhere to watch Michigan vs. Michigan State liveDate: Friday, Jan. 30 | Time: 8 p.m. ET  Location: Breslin Center -- East Lansing, Michigan  TV: Fox | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)  Michigan vs. Michigan State prediction, pick\nMichigan is 5-0 in true road games this season, while Michigan State is 11-1 at home. The Wolverines have played better since dropping their first game of the season against Wisconsin. The key matchup here is whether Lendeborg can get going. The former UAB star was a double-double machine last season. However, he has recorded just three double-doubles at Michigan. My prediction is he has a big night, and Michigan wins by five. Pick: Michigan -1.5Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.         \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Throughout the offseason the CBS Sports MLB   experts will bring you a                                       weekly Batting Around roundtable,         breaking         down      pretty       much           anything.       The      latest   news, a      historical      question,            thoughts         about         the future  of         baseball,   all      sorts of     stuff. Last week we discussed the idea of a salary cap. This week we're going to tackle Brendan Donovan's future.  Will the Cardinals trade Brendan Donovan before spring training? Where will he go? R.J. Anderson: I would assume that Donovan still gets traded before  spring training begins. He's a quality player, but he probably has more  value to a surefire contender than he does to a retooling Cardinals that  could repurpose his plate appearances to younger options. As for where  he goes, the Mariners make a lot of sense on paper. They have the need  for a player like Donovan, as well as the prospect depth to get a deal  done.  Matt Snyder: Yeah, I think the path is clear now. Maybe Eugenio Suárez  needs to sign or teams need to realize the Cubs would need to be  completely bowled over to part with Nico Hoerner, but everything else  that was once standing in the way of a Donovan deal is settled. It's the  perfect time for the Cardinals to get the best offer from teams that  still need to beef up their position-player side of the roster. I agree  with RJ that the Mariners would be a great fit, but I'll go back to the  well with the Cardinals-Red Sox connection and say Donovan ends up as  the everyday second baseman in Boston. \nDayn Perry: While I'm less confident that he'll be traded before  spring training than I was earlier in the offseason, I still think it's  more likely to happen than not. They'd really like to have the decks  clear for JJ Wetherholt to be the second baseman, and they'd also like  to give Nolan Gorman a season of uninterrupted run to see if he can take  his strikeout issues. Donovan's return would make all of that,  especially the latter consideration, pretty difficult. With a lot of  infield options off the board, I think it happens before camps get  moving in earnest. I'll say he goes to the Giants and gives them a  needed dose of OBP and infield stability.  Mike Axisa: Yeah, I think Donovan goes before the Cardinals open camp in two weeks. Remember, the Willson Contreras and Sonny Gray trades came out of nowhere. We all knew those two were on the block, though there weren't many rumors involving either, then bam, they were traded. It may seem like things are quiet with Donovan right now, but for sure, St. Louis is working hard behind the scenes to get a deal done. I expect them to get it done within a week or two. \nAs for where he'll go, I think the Mariners are most likely with the Giants the runner-up. For the sake of variety, I'll throw the Astros in the mix. They want a left-handed bat and Donovan's versatility means it won't ever be difficult to get him in the lineup. Houston's farm system is not great and matching up with the Cardinals could be a challenge, but I could see them making a run at Donovan. \n            ",

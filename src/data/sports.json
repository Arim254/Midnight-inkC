    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES -- This was the type of game where you drop to your knees and thank heavens you decided, at whatever point, to become a baseball fan. I found myself thinking in the seventh inning that if you just randomly brought a non-baseball fan to this game, they'd immediately become a die-hard fan, hooked for the rest of their life. It was almost like -- just a few miles from Hollywood -- the game was scripted for maximum entertainment. It lasted 18 innings and ended on another Freddie Freeman walk-off home run, just like Game 1 of last year's World Series. This one was a solo shot to dead center field. The thousands of fans who were still in attendance shot to their feet and roared, soon serenaded with \"I love L.A.\" It was a 6-5 Dodgers win in 18 innings.The extra-innings portion of the game dragged and, let's face it, no one who had never seen baseball before would want to be here for almost seven hours. For those first 7-9 innings, though, it was breathtaking and the whole game provided plenty of quirky twists and turns. And then a walk-off home run. All's well that ends well. \"It's one of the greatest World Series games of all time,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"Emotional. I'm spent emotionally.\"\nI've been to some amazing games. I thought about the walk-off grand slam last year, Game 7 in 2016 (because of course I did), Game 5 in 2017, Game 6 in 2011 and so many more. There were more dramatic endings in that list, more weight-of-history games in there and higher-scoring affairs, but this one was incredible theater like only a few others have had in recent World Series history. Again, if we limited our scope to nine innings, it was only missing the dramatic ending. And in extras, there were plenty of close calls. There was a ton of traffic on the bases. The two teams combined to leave 37 men on base. Both teams were tantalizingly close multiple times to taking this one in extras before the 18th, when the Blue Jays stranded runners on second and third base before the Freeman walk-off.There were even storylines that went beyond this particular game. Remember, this is the first-ever World Series meeting between the Blue Jays and Dodgers. There's history with George Springer from the 2017 Astros, and he's been showered with boos like I've rarely heard before. We had an all-time great pitcher starting on the mound for the Blue Jays in Max Scherzer. Even post-prime Scherzer at age 41 was pretty good for the most part. He looked like vintage Mad Max for a few moments. And Shohei Ohtani was responsible for RBI on two of the three runs charged to Scherzer. Can't really blame him there. \nDid I say Ohtani? Yes, the best baseball player in the world was front and center in this one. Again. He led off with a double. Then he hit a home run. Then he doubled home an important run during a game-tying rally. Next time up, with the Dodgers trailing again, he again tied it. This time with a home run. That's 12 total bases, two shy of the World Series record. After that home run, Ohtani was 9 for his last 15 with six home runs and two doubles. Are you kidding me with this? It's about the time someone misguidedly says, \"you can't make this stuff up!\" Yeah, you could. We could do it in a movie. Before Ohtani came about, though, most people would've deemed the movie unrealistic, even before you consider the pitching.That's how good he is. The Blue Jays realized what was going on and intentionally walked him the rest of the game. Yes, four intentional walks before he took a four-pitch walk where every pitch was far out of the strike zone. The ol' unintentional intentional walk. Ohtani got on base nine times. That's a record both for the regular season and postseason. \nThis game wasn't all Ohtani. Far from it. He was a main character, but there were plenty of other huge moments. We saw the Dodgers jump out to a 1-0 lead in the second on a Teoscar Hernández home run. It was his sixth of the playoffs in 13 games. Ohtani's homer in the third came next, putting the Dodgers up 2-0. The door was left open for a Blue Jays rally in the fourth on a Tommy Edman error and the Jays burst through that door. An Alejandro Kirk three-run home run gave them the lead and they tacked on another run after that. Kirk, by the way, had 15 homers and 76 RBI in 130 regular-season games. In the playoffs, he now has five home runs and 13 RBI in 14 games.\nThe Dodgers answered in the fifth, as Ohtani hit an RBI double and Freddie Freeman drove him home with a shot down the first-base line. That same first-base line came into play (again) in the seventh when the Blue Jays took the lead (again). Vladimir Guerrero Jr. singled and Bo Bichette -- hobbled leg and all -- sent a shot right down that same line. A wicked carom off some broadcasting equipment gave a bit of extra time to help Guerrero score from first, barely. He even did a fun slap of home plate to beat the tag. And then Ohtani tied it with the seventh-inning homer.There were all kinds of quirky plays mixed in. A runner was thrown out at third after trying to advance on an infield hit. A ball hit off Freeman's glove in the eighth for a hit, but then a runner trying to go from first to third was thrown out. There were close calls on the bases. Freeman was thrown out at home on a not-so-close call. There was even a play where a runner on first base was picked off because he thought a batter had drawn a walk, though it was called a strike instead of a ball. The top of the 10th ended with a runner being thrown out at the plate with his star teammate on deck.\nIn fact, Edman made two of those throws, redeeming himself for that bad error earlier.There was a play at third base in the 11th where the defender tried to field a possible infield hit with two runners on by standing with a foot on the bag while he grabbed the ball. It didn't work. The runner was safe. Man, we had so many quirky plays.A starting pitcher who temporarily converted to closer had to come in and get five outs to finish the ninth. He was followed by another starter who is coming out of the bullpen this October.\nAnd then another all-time great, Clayton Kershaw, entered in the 11th with the bases loaded. He's in his final season and gave up five runs in two innings in his NLDS outing and hadn't pitched since. He faced a 31-year-old in Nathan Lukes, who spent 10 years in the minors. He fouled off two 3-2 pitches before grounding out softly to end the inning. Will Klein, who had one inning of playoff experience and less than 23 innings of regular-season experience in his career threw four scoreless innings for the Dodgers in relief. He'd never previously gone more than two innings in an MLB outing.Drama. Fun. Redemption. Historically great players going at it. Marathon extra innings with several tease jobs. Game 3 of the 2025 World Series truly had it all.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly every Baylor game in 2025 has followed the same script. The Bears fall behind early, struggle to get stops and give up big plays. The defense misses tackles, takes bad angles and looks unprepared -- a particularly glaring issue given that head coach Dave Aranda also serves as defensive coordinator.Then, in the second half, Baylor's passing game catches fire. Quarterback Sawyer Robertson puts up heroic numbers and the Bears storm back. Sometimes they win. Sometimes they lose. Occasionally, they get embarrassed. Each week, fans leave more frustrated -- and lately, many aren't showing up at all.Saturday's 41-20 loss to No. 21 Cincinnati was another low point. Baylor trailed 24-0 before cutting the deficit to seven in the fourth quarter, only to give up two late touchdowns to quarterback Brendan Sorsby. The result dropped the Bears to 4-4 overall and 2-3 in Big 12 play.Baylor has stuck with Aranda for six seasons. Despite three losing campaigns in his first four years, a Big 12 title and AP top-five finish in 2021 bought him time. A six-game winning streak to end 2024 appeared to signal momentum and made Baylor a trendy pick to contend for the Big 12 crown this fall. Expectations were high.\n\n        \n            \n                College Football Power Rankings: Indiana tightens grip on No. 1 position as Miami returns to top 10\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nInstead, Baylor has become irrelevant -- squandering any momentum it had entering the realigned Big 12. And despite one of the most active coaching carousels in college football history, the Bears may soon need to join the market.The situation is complicated. Baylor is still likely to make a bowl game. The program hasn't fired a coach for on-field reasons since 2007. Aranda also delivered a Big 12 championship and Sugar Bowl win in 2021 -- arguably the greatest season in school history. Had Oklahoma State running back Dezmon Jackson reached the goal line in that 2021 title game, Aranda might have been gone two years ago.In isolation, some results this season are defensible. Cincinnati is a legitimate Big 12 contender. Losing standout defensive end Jackie Marshall against Auburn changed that game, and Baylor nearly upset reigning Big 12 champion Arizona State.\nBut that's the problem -- Baylor under Aranda is always \"close.\" Always working on fixing mistakes. After six seasons and a 35-34 record, mediocrity has become the ceiling. With a third conference loss -- and likely more coming -- even that might slip away for a veteran-laden 2025 roster.Aranda, like many coaches hired in 2020, faced unprecedented challenges. He navigated the pandemic and the rapid rise of NIL with little guidance, and he's long been known as a stickler for rules. After the historic 2021 season, he signed a middling recruiting class and resisted embracing the transfer portal and NIL. That stubbornness helped lead to a 3-9 finish in 2023.Following that season, Aranda presented a plan to modernize his approach. He deserved the chance to make it right, and his buyout likely helped his case. Over the offseason, he reshaped his roster and staff in ways that appeared promising. On paper, it worked. In practice, it hasn't.\nIronically, Aranda's downfall may come from his greatest strength: his defensive background. Baylor ranks No. 106 nationally in total defense, allowing 5.7 yards per play and more than 180 rushing yards per game -- worse than all but Kansas and Colorado. The Bears sit in the bottom 25 in tackles for loss, and Marshall is the only defensive lineman with a sack.The closing sequence against Cincinnati captured everything wrong with the program. After cutting the deficit to seven, Baylor forced a second-and-13 but immediately gave up a wide-open pass over the middle for a first down. The drive bled more than seven minutes off the clock and ended in a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, receiver Kole Wilson fumbled deep in Baylor territory, setting up another quick score. In 15 plays, a one-score game became a blowout. Every mistake was preventable — but Baylor simply didn't prevent them.This is Aranda's defense, built in his image and called by him. By any measure, it's among the worst in college football. Hiring a new play-caller would mark his fourth on defense -- and seventh coordinator overall -- in five years. There's no one left to fire, and no changes left to make.\nThere is talent on this roster. Robertson and tight end Michael Trigg are among the nation's statistical leaders, and receiver Josh Cameron ranks among the Big 12's best. But none of them are expected to return in 2026.This was supposed to be the culmination season for Baylor football, much like 2013 and 2019 before it. Instead, the Bears are 4-4, staring down another rebuild.Aranda has repeatedly learned from his mistakes, adapted and made the right moves — just always too late.\nBaylor can't afford to make that same mistake again.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        All things must pass, especially the mantle of Premier League crisis club. At some indeterminate point in the future, perhaps much earlier than their rivals might hope, Liverpool fans will be looking on with a sense of relief at the pickle that one of their rivals has landed themselves in. Five weeks ago English football was trembling at the emergence of the next great dynasty. Liverpool had contrived to win every game when they were out of form. Woe betide everyone else in the division when it all clicked for the champions.But of course it hasn't. Four defeats on the spin in the Premier League have Liverpool's title challenge looking ever more perilous and up next is the team who began this whirlwind month, Crystal Palace out to do unto Arne Slot in the EFL Cup as they did in the Premier League. And now, given that the cracks apparent in August and September have broken ever wider of late, it is hard to shake the sense that when Liverpool re-emerge as a force, they will not look like they did now. For starters, too many of the fundamentals seem broken. This is a team that cannot keep the ball out of their own net. Only Arsenal and Burnley have failed to score against Liverpool this season; the other 11 competitive opponents have 19 goals to their name. There's no particular scoring luck to that, nor have the Reds had the misfortune of running into a lot of hot teams. They are simply a team unable to deal with the basics of a Premier League attack.That has often been framed in terms of set pieces, and they are struggling with six concessions in the Premier League alone. Liverpool's struggles there are hard to explain; the best Jurgen Klopp teams dominated off dead balls, but they seem to have fallen by the wayside under Slot, who should be able to get more from his players in aerial battles than they are giving him. After all only Wolverhampton Wanderers have rolled out more players 6 foot 2 or taller than the nine who have taken the field for Liverpool, two of whom are goalkeepers.\nSet balls almost feels like a secondary issue to the biggest issue facing their defense, the fact that this is a team that gets run through when it loses possession. Liverpool have allowed 14 shots from counter attacks this season, no one else has given up more than 10. As anyone that saw them against Brentford can attest, passes over the top and through the lines are killing this team.Much of the blame for this has been placed on the defense and in particular of late Virgil van Dijk. It is probably fair to say that the 34-year-old has lost some of the pace of old; the moment a few forwards twig that then a lot of the aura of old goes with it too. He himself has acknowledged the need for improvement, saying on Saturday that \"everyone has to look in the mirror, including myself.\" It was, however, what he said just before that best reflected what has gone wrong at Liverpool. \"It's easy to blame a particular person, the backline or set-pieces, but it's a collective thing in the end.\"Van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate have looked so out of sorts this season because they aren't getting the protection they got last season. That starts with their pressing, a team that recovered possession four and a half times per game in the attacking third in 2024-25 is now down to 3.3 this term, about half of what a Klopp team might do, even in the years where the intensity was dialed down a smidge. It used to be that only Mohamed Salah got to rest when his team didn't have the ball. Now it seems that at least half the attack are empowered to catch their breath.\nIt is probably also true that Liverpool's opposition just don't fear the damage their frontline might cause as currently constituted. Salah looks satiated, even the best of the rest in Hugo Ekitike is at 0.42 xG per 90. In a league where no team is willing to sit back and take a punishment, you'd gamble that you can overcome what Liverpool's attack might do to you.The midfielders too aren't hitting like they used to, fewer ball recoveries and interceptions, too many occasions where Dominik Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones find themselves behind play that is bearing down on their defenders. Opponents are not passing that well against Liverpool, but in part that is probably because teams have twigged the value of just getting it up the field quickly so their forwards can compete and punish the gaps left by the fullbacks. It is in those positions that Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards most obviously erred during their summer trolley dash. Neither Jeremie Frimpgong nor Milos Kerkez are at all at ease going backwards; it would be no trouble to have both in the squad if Liverpool had a few other full back options who could tuck inside when the other bombed on. Barring Joe Gomez and maybe jamming Andrew Robertson into a role he is not hugely comfortable with, those options really aren't there. Neither is a prime Fabinho type, the sort of midfielder who could drop back when the center backs split and allow Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold to bomb on.\nBoth Kerkez and Frimpong look like players who will be at their best if Liverpool played with a three man defense. They're not the only new recruits for whom that is the case. Florian Wirtz excelled in Xabi Alonso's 3-4-2-1 and if you're going to drop a combined $250 million on a pair of center forwards -- Ekitike and Alexander Isak -- you might as well find a way that they can play together. In the summer Liverpool's recruitment seemed like a vision of a post-Salah future. If it weren't for Isak's latest groin issue, more of this article might be given over to discussing whether the new era had already arrived.Ultimately, it is hard to shake the sense that post crisis Liverpool, whenever that comes, is likely take up a notably different formation to the 4-4-2 Slot employed last week. So long as the front six can't protect them, this team cannot roll with a back four. The last compelling argument to not shift to a back three is that the deadline day fumbling of Marc Guehi's signature left this team without enough center backs. They will have to make do with what they have. Robertson and Gomez could fill in while Slot also experimented with Ryan Gravenberch at center back in preseason and against Chelsea. Frimpong, Kerkez and Conor Bradley could all focus that little bit more on what they are good at, pushing on down the flanks in possession and providing the sort of pure width that none of Liverpool's attackers do naturally. That extra body in defense might allow for Dominik Szoboszlai's pressing qualities to be exploited on turnovers. If a switch to a back three can add some passing angles from deep it might stop the baffling trend of Wirtz dropping deep to get the ball progressing into the sort of spots on the field where he has historically done the most damage by receiving passes and creating. In Isak's absence the German could slip into the left inside forward role he excelled at with Leverkusen, Ekitike leading the line and Mohamed Salah in the pockets where he has historically been rather effective.\nSuch a radical change doesn't guarantee that Liverpool will press better. It doesn't make them better at organising themselves from set pieces. It certainly won't bring back prime Van Dijk and Salah if they have left the stage. Even if the different shape plugs the current gaps there is no guarantee that leaks won't burst elsewhere.In their current situation, however, Liverpool don't have much choice but to try something else. Their struggles are far gone enough to suggest that when they do emerge out of this dark tunnel, it will be in a rather different form to the one they had on entry.How to watch Liverpool vs. Crystal PalaceDate: Wednesday, Oct. 29 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, EnglandLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Liverpool -165; Draw +375; Crystal Palace +425\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There has been an abnormal amount of excitement bubbling up regarding to the 2027 NFL Draft-eligible class, particularly Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith and Alabama wide receiver Ryan Williams. Is that belief grounded in reason or another example of hyperbole?The practice of evaluating talent can be a difficult venture because there are so many variables at play. Coaching, culture and supporting cast are some of the contributing factors. Some of the best receivers in the game -- Justin Jefferson, Malik Nabers, Puka Nacua, etc. -- were not even the first at the position taken in their respective drafts. Comparatively, Marvin Harrison Jr. was thought to be a clean prospect, and he has struggled out of the gate. Coming into this college football season, we thought the offensive tackle position was deep and the wide receiver position was not. Garrett Nussmeier, LaNorris Sellers and Arch Manning -- not Cade Klubnik, sorry -- were thought to be the top quarterback prospects. A lot can change when games are played, but the 2027 draft-eligible class brings as much promise as 2024, when young stars like Nabers, tight end Brock Bowers, edge rusher Jared Verse and offensive tackle Joe Alt entered the league. And that's not even including the quarterback class, which featured Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye, Michael Penix Jr., Bo Nix and J.J. McCarthy -- all within the top-12 picks. \nAs a result, teams may be more stingy to part with early-round selections in the 2027 NFL Draft over the next week-plus as the trade deadline approaches. Top 2027 NFL Draft prospects to knowThe perception of a class is often dictated by the quality and quantity of quarterback prospects. Nebraska's Dylan Raiola will likely factor into that conversation, and Notre Dame's CJ Carr has shown ample development over the course of his first season empowered as the starting quarterback. Florida's DJ Lagway will be at the mercy of the Gators' next coaching hire, but obviously has the talent to take a leap. Four prospects often present in 2025 first-round mock drafts -- Indiana's Fernando Mendoza, Oregon's Dante Moore, Alabama's Ty Simpson and South Carolina's LaNorris Sellers -- all have eligibility beyond the current season. If one or more of those players return to play an additional year of college football, then that group becomes even stronger. \nThe wide receiver class is particularly intriguing with the list extending beyond Smith and Williams. Auburn's Cam Coleman, Texas' Ryan Wingo and Michigan State's Nick Marsh are some others garnering attention from NFL talent evaluators. Smith is the real deal. There is a speed at which he plays different from others on the field. The term \"generational talent\" has been overplayed the past decade, but Smith does appear to be one of the best wide receiver prospects in recent memory. There are several other names -- including Notre Dame offensive tackle Anthonie Knapp, Colorado offensive tackle Jordan Seaton, South Carolina edge rusher Dylan Stewart, Texas edge rusher Colin Simmons and Notre Dame cornerback Leonard Moore -- who are also high-level talents at premier positions. Some of the offensive tackles expected to be taken high in this year's draft may opt to return for another year of development as well, which would only add more depth and quality to the class.\n\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 3.0: Jets and Raiders take QBs in top 5 amid stronger WR and defensive classes\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHow the 2027 class stacks up against 2025 and 2026Contrast that with the talent available in the 2025 and 2026 draft classes. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter, Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter and Boise State running back Ashton Jeanty were considered the elite talents a year ago. Those three players have had varying levels of success as professionals thus far.When evaluating the 2026 NFL Draft, there is not a clear favorite to be the No. 1 overall selection aside from the quarterbacks because of positional value. Some of the top prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft play positions not viewed as worthy of top-10 overall picks: linebacker and safety. Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr., Ohio State safety Caleb Downs, Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese and perhaps Clemson defensive tackle Peter Woods are regarded as the top prospects eligible for the upcoming draft aside from the aforementioned quarterback prospects. \nThere are some intriguing talents eligible for the upcoming draft, but it does not seem as though the volume of talent favorably compares to 2027. Value is absolutely taken into consideration as well. Ten receivers have signed active contracts worth $30 million or more per year. The four-year value of the contract given to the No. 1 overall selection in the 2025 NFL Draft was less than $50 million. How the 2027 talent pool could shape front-office strategy?Under those circumstances, teams may be slower to part with 2027 first-round picks knowing that it could be the largest assortment of blue-chip talents available in a few years. Having said that, if those assets are needed to facilitate a move for a quarterback prospect, then it would be a justifiable expense. The only 2027 top-100 pick to be traded thus far is Green Bay's first-round pick in exchange for Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons. The Packers will likely be picking towards the end of the round so, even in a year with more depth and talent, Dallas would theoretically miss out on the upper crust. However, two picks in the round would allow Dallas the freedom to perhaps target one player otherwise out of its reach. \nAs the NFL trade deadline approaches Nov. 4, it will be interesting to see how many picks in the 2027 NFL Draft are moved. The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        Toronto Blue Jays star George Springer exited Monday night's World Series Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers with what the team is calling \"right side discomfort.\" Springer, who was replaced by veteran infielder Ty France, was also forced out of a game during the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners when he was hit on the right knee by an errant pitch from right-hander Bryan Woo.Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Springer had gotten an MRI and the team was awaiting the results of the test.\"We'll see how it comes back and see how he walks up tomorrow,\" Schneider said. \"But it sucks. He's obviously a huge part of our lineup. Glad I got him out when I did and hopefully it didn't make anything worse, but we'll see how he is tomorrow.\"Springer, 36, called for the training staff after taking a first-pitch swing to open the top of the seventh. He grabbed at his right side, and while there's not word yet on what injury he suffered, that tends to be the universal sign of an oblique or intercoastal strain. Here's a look at the play in question:\nSpringer entered Game 3 hitting .259/.339/.593 with four home runs and nine runs batted in over the course of his first 13 postseason games this month. Springer had been one of the main talking points entering Game 3, with reporters asking manager John Schneider (among others) about how Dodger Stadium's crowd was likely to receive him. Keep in mind, the Dodgers felt wronged by Springer for his employment by the Houston Astros during their sign-stealing scandal. \"I know he's prepared for it. He's been dealing with that for a long time,\" ,\" Schneider said Monday. \"It kind of is what it is. I think me, the manager in me, I probably get more mad than he does because you always have this like protective mode of your players.\n\"But I don't think it can galvanize a team, I don't think that it will directly affect what anyone is doing, and I don't think it's going to affect anything George is doing. George is arguably one of the best World Series performers in the history of the game. So I think that fans, they show their opinion or emotion, that's fine. George has an unbelievable ability to keep himself focused and present on what he's doing.\"\n            ",

In the process, Ohtani became the first player with at least four extra-base knocks in a single World Series contest since 1906, as well as the first player to ever reach base nine times in a single playoff gameOhtani doubled in his first at-bat to lead off the bottom of the first against Blue Jays right-hander Max Scherzer; homered in his second trip to the plate in the bottom of the third (at the time giving the Dodgers a 2-0 lead); doubled again in his third at-bat in the bottom of the fifth (plating another run); and then tied the game at 5-5 in the bottom of the seventh with his second blast.Here's a look at the second home run in video form:Ohtani was intentionally walked in each of his next four plate appearances, then unintentionally in the 17th inning.\nOhtani's performance tied him with Chicago White Sox utility player Frank Isbell, whose own four extra-base hit World Series outing saw him double four times in Game 5 of the 1906 Fall Classic against the Chicago Cubs. The White Sox would go on to win that series in six games.The two-way superstar also became the first player in Major League Baseball history with three multi-home run games during a single postseason, though that fact can be owed (at least in part) to the expanded tournament. He had previously launched multiple home runs in both Game 4 of the NLCS and Game 1 of the NLDS.Ohtani's 12 total bases tied him with Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth for the third most in a single World Series contest. Albert Pujols delivered 14 total bases in Game 3 of the 2011 Fall Classic, while Pablo Sandoval delivered 13 as part of Game 1 in 2012.\nThe Dodgers scraped out an 18th-inning walk-off win on a Freddie Freeman home run.\n            \n    ",

The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series.

    "body": "\n        It's not a primetime game, but the contest many will highlight with their Week 9 NFL picks is Chiefs vs. Bills at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday. It's become, arguably, the league's preeminent rivalry, and the latest installment has Kansas City as 1.5-point road favorites, per the Week 9 NFL odds. Meanwhile, other contests to be of high interest with NFL bets involve a pair of West Coast teams flying east in 49ers vs. Giants (+2.5) and Seahawks vs. Commanders (+3.5).If looking for a divisional rivalry when scanning the latest Week 9 NFL lines, you'll just find one in Lions vs. Vikings. Any rest advantage Minnesota hoped for from playing last Thursday is negated by Detroit coming off a bye, and the Lions are one of the biggest favorites, per the Week 9 NFL spreads, as they're giving 8.5 points. Other large lines include Packers vs. Panthers (+12.5), Chargers vs. Titans (+10) and Rams vs. Saints (+13.5). All of the updated Week 9 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 9 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Much has been made about Denver's defense, which ranks fifth in both scoring and total, but Houston boasts the No. 1 defense in both points allowed and yards allowed. It has a +7 turnover differential over the last four games, while Denver has a negative turnover differential (-1) on the season. The Texans offense is also rounding into form as C.J. Stroud had his first 300-yard passing game in Sunday's win over San Francisco, and he was not sacked for the first time this season.Houston has now covered in three of its last four, while Denver is 0-2 versus the line as a road favorite. The Broncos have some questions with their passing game, as the team ranks in the bottom 10 in completion percentage and yards per attempt, while Bo Nix has often come up short in true road games. Nix is just 2-7 outright over his last nine starts in away stadiums as the model has Houston prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 9 NFL predictions: the Chargers (-10, 42.5) cover versus the Titans in nearly 60% of simulations. The firing of Brian Callahan hasn't provided the spark that many Titans fans hoped for as the team's lost its two games since, one by 18 points at home and the other by 24 points on the road. Each of Tennessee's last six losses have come by double-digits, and many of those weren't versus teams that are the caliber of the Chargers. Los Angeles ranks in the top eight of the NFL in yards gained, yards allowed, passing offense and passing defense.Meanwhile, Tennessee is dead last in nearly every offensive category, and no team has allowed more rushing touchdowns on defense. The Titans are a staggering 4-21 against the spread since 2024, which is worst in the NFL and amounts to a 16% cover rate. Cam Ward doesn't have a single game so far in which he has more touchdowns than turnovers, as the Chargers are forecasted for a two-touchdown victory. The model also says the Over hits in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 9 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 9 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams that win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday.

Moore and the University withdrew their respective appeals on Sept. 29 and Oct. 6., according to ESPN. In August, the NCAA Committee on Infractions announced that Michigan committed multiple Level I violations regarding impermissible off campus scouting. More specifically, the committee determined that Michigan created a system designed to stealing opponents' signs during the 2021, 2022 and part of the 2023 season. While they have been handed fines that could total $30 million, Michigan was able to avoid a postseason ban and the vacating of past victories, most especially the program's 2023 national championship, the school's first since 1997 when they shared the title with Nebraska. \n        \n            \n                Marcus Freeman, Sherrone Moore advocate for return of Notre Dame vs. Michigan rivalry\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMoore was handed a two-year show-cause order and was suspended for three games across two seasons. He sat out two of Michigan's games earlier this season and is slated to sit out next year's season-opener against Western Michigan. \nFormer Michigan coach and current Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh was hit with a 10-year show-cause penalty for his involvement in the scandal. While the penalty won't impact his current situation with the Chargers, it would make it extremely difficult for him to land another college coaching job as that institution would need to justify his hiring to the NCAA. Michigan's football program's rise under Harbaugh coincided with the team's sign stealing scandal. The Wolverines won 64.4% of their games from 2017-20 before winning 93% of their games from 2021-23. The later stretch included three straight wins over an Ohio State team that had been 5-0 against Harbaugh-led Michigan teams prior to the 2021 season. \nMoore, who is currently in his second full season as Michigan's coach, has guided this year's team to an 6-2 start. The Wolverines, who are currently No. 21 in the AP poll, will face Purdue this Saturday at \"the Big House.\" \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs just keep rolling, improving to 6-2 after Monday night's convincing 28-7 win over the Washington Commanders. What was dubbed an important game on the \"Monday Night Football\" slate at the beginning of the season had little pizazz, due to the Commanders having a sub-.500 record and Jayden Daniels being out for this game.Kansas City outscored Washington 21-0 in the second half, as the Commanders struggled to keep pace with Marcus Mariota filling in for Daniels. The Chiefs scored on their first three second-half possessions and never looked back, as Patrick Mahomes threw three touchdown passes in the final 30 minutes.A game that was close at halftime turned into another blowout in Week 8, which tied for the most 18-plus point wins in a single week in NFL history (nine). This week also featured the fewest games decided by single digits since Week 14 in 1970 (one).This \"Monday Night Football\" matchup was uneventful but still enough to spark overreactions. Which ones have merit, and which are truly overreactions?\nChiefs' next three games will determine home-field advantage in the AFCOverreaction or reality: Reality The Chiefs are 5-1 since their 0-2 start, improving to 5-3 on the season and staying alive in the AFC West race. Kansas City is one of seven teams currently in the playoff picture, but there's still a long season ahead. The Chiefs are among the best teams in the conference -- but can they truly compete for the top seed in the AFC?Here are the Chiefs' next three games: at Bills, at Broncos (after the bye) and vs. Colts. These three matchups will go a long way in determining whether Kansas City can earn home-field advantage in the AFC and capture the division. The Buffalo game is massive on its own, but it could also decide whether the Chiefs go to Buffalo or the Bills come to Kansas City in January.This will also be Kansas City's first game against Denver this year, so a win would allow the Chiefs to leap the Broncos in the playoff standings.\nFinally, the showdown against the Colts is a litmus test for both teams. The winner of that game -- assuming the Chiefs go 2-0 in their next two -- could ultimately determine who lands the No. 1 seed in the AFC. If the Chiefs go 3-0, there's a strong chance they'll secure the top seed. Even a 2-1 stretch would keep them firmly in the mix.These next few games are massive for Kansas City's season.Commanders fooled themselves into thinking they were Super Bowl contendersOverreaction or reality: Reality The Commanders were the surprise of the 2024 season, going from 4-13 to 12-5 and reaching the NFC Championship Game. Last year was the best season Washington had since 1991, and the franchise was fooled by that shocking turnaround.Jayden Daniels was one of the best quarterbacks in football during his rookie season. This year, he's missed three games and hasn't been the same game-changing player when he's been on the field. Washington also has the oldest roster in the NFL, and injuries have hit several of its core players. The Commanders don't have an elite player outside of Daniels, and it shows week to week.\nWashington was also fooled by its six wins when tied or trailing with 10 seconds left — the most by any team in NFL history. The Commanders were fortunate to pull out those games and avoid major injuries, luck that hasn't carried over this season. The 3-5 record shouldn't be surprising, especially with Daniels missing as much time as he has.This is an old football team -- one that needs to get younger and fix its issues on the defensive side of the ball. Most of the acquisitions Washington made this offseason were aging veterans, and that can't continue if the Commanders want to make a Super Bowl run in 2026.Chiefs need to add a running back at the trade deadlineOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Chiefs are in the midst of another Super Bowl run and already have an excellent passing game with Rashee Rice back and their left tackle issues from last season fixed. The missing component on offense appears to be at running back, where Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt have held down the fort.\nHere's the catch: the Chiefs have been running the ball well. Kansas City rushed 30 times for 148 yards on Monday night, averaging 4.9 yards per carry. Over the last four games, the Chiefs rank third in rushing yards (570), third in rushing touchdowns (six) and 11th in yards per carry (4.7). Kansas City is running the ball efficiently -- fifth in the NFL in yards before contact per rush (2.05), a testament to the offensive line.Do the Chiefs have a dynamic running back who can change a game? Absolutely not. But they have a solid committee led by Pacheco and Hunt. The Chiefs could improve in yards after contact, but they're getting enough from what they have.Kansas City doesn't need to add a running back, though it likely will to make the offense even more explosive. For now, the Chiefs can ride with Pacheco and Hunt.\nChiefs are better through eight games this year than last yearOverreaction or reality: Reality The records are completely different after eight games. Kansas City was 8-0 through its first eight games last season but had just a plus-56 point differential and a minus-4 turnover margin. The Chiefs are only 5-3 through eight games this year but have a plus-83 point differential and a plus-8 turnover margin.Kansas City is better along the offensive line, averaging more yards per play (5.8 to 5.2) as a result. The Chiefs averaged 24.6 points per game through eight games in 2024 and 26.8 through eight games in 2025. They aren't surviving on one-score victories this season; instead, they're demonstrating dominance over opponents.Mahomes has 17 touchdowns to four interceptions (103.1 passer rating) through eight games this year compared with 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions (90.1 rating) last year. The defense ranks fourth in yards allowed per game (277.8) and second in points allowed per game (16.4) through eight games this year, compared with fourth in points allowed (18.4) and fifth in yards allowed (293.6) last season.\nThis Chiefs team is better through eight games than last year's team, even though the 2024 version was unbeaten at this point.\n            ",

During New England's winning streak, they've held all five opponents to 20 points or less while averaging nearly 31 points per game.For the Broncos, it's been a different story having trailed at some point during all five wins. This week, the Patriots are 5.5-point favorites against the Falcons, while the Broncos are 1.5-point underdogs at Houston.

Pittsburgh enters off two straight losses where they have surrendered more than 30 points, while Indianapolis has won four straight contests, having scored 31 points or more in each game.\"Pittsburgh's defense has looked awful in their last two games against Cincinnati and Green Bay, so how could they possibly fare that much better against the league's highest scoring team? Football, especially in the NFL, is a funny game. This Week 9 home contest is a must for the Steelers who need to build up as much ground as they can between themselves and the soon-to-be-charging Ravens. Indianapolis is currently the frontrunner for the AFC's No. 1 seed, but that can't last too much longer, right? It seems like the fairy tell has to come to an end at some point. While Indy is still a playoff team, I will be fading them as a road favorite in Pittsburgh on Sunday. Steelers 26, Colts 24\". See his other Week 9 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 9 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 9 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

The Week 8 slate certainly had some pivotal games that impacted playoff races.The New York Jets likely took the Cincinnati Bengals out of the AFC North hunt with their upset win. The Dallas Cowboys' playoff chances took a massive hit with their loss to the Denver Broncos, while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers appear to be cruising toward their fifth straight NFC South title. The Indianapolis Colts have the best record in football and are atop the AFC, while the Green Bay Packers maintained their No. 1 spot in the NFC thanks to their big win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday night. The Kansas City Chiefs are also in the playoff picture after their win over the Washington Commanders on Monday night.Below is a breakdown of the seven teams that are currently in the playoffs after Week 8. In addition to the seven playoff teams, let's look at their schedules and predict if they'll get in the playoffs or not -- along with the contenders for a playoff spot. \nAFC playoff pictureSeedTeamWLTPCT1Colts710 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.8752Patriots620 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7503Broncos620 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7504Steelers430 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.5715Bills520.7146Chargers530.6257Chiefs530.6251. Indianapolis Colts (7-1)Remaining schedule: at Steelers, vs. Falcons, Bye, at Chiefs, vs. Texans, at Jaguars, at Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, at TexansThe Colts are two games up in the loss column in the AFC South standings, which is their division to lose. Not only should Indianapolis have a playoff spot come January, but the Colts are a contender for home-field advantage. They also have wins over the Broncos, Rams and Chargers -- all teams with winning records. 2. New England Patriots (6-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Falcons, at Buccaneers, vs. Jets, at Bengals, vs. Giants, Bye, vs. Bills, at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots still have the lead over the Bills in the AFC East via the head-to-head tiebreaker and have taken advantage of a light schedule, which included Sunday's win over the Browns. New England should challenge Buffalo for the division, with a favorable schedule until the bye week. At worst, the Patriots are a wild card based on how they're playing. 3. Denver Broncos (6-2)Remaining schedule: at Texans, vs. Raiders, vs. Chiefs, Bye, at Commanders, at Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersA dominant victory over the Cowboys solidifies the Broncos as contenders for the AFC West, as the division leaders will be in the mix all year. The schedule gets a little easier over the next month, but the Broncos still have to play the Chiefs twice. Denver is making its case for a return trip to the playoffs.  4. Pittsburgh Steelers (4-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Colts, at Chargers, vs. Bengals, at Bears, vs. Bills, at Ravens, vs. Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers are trying to fall back to the field in the AFC North with two straight losses, but the Bengals helped by falling to the Jets. The schedule does get significantly tougher, and the Steelers play the Ravens twice. Pittsburgh leads the division by two games in the loss column, a sign how poor the AFC North is. 5. Buffalo Bills (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Chiefs, at Dolphins, vs. Buccaneers, at Texans, at Steelers, vs. Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsThe Bills got on the right track with a blowout win over the Panthers on Sunday, keeping pace with the Patriots in the AFC East. A win over the Chiefs in Week 9 will catapult the Bills' season, as significant playoff implications for both teams are at stake. 6. Los Angeles Chargers (5-3)Remaining schedule: at Titans, vs. Steelers, at Jaguars, Bye, vs. Raiders, vs. Eagles, at Chiefs, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers had a convincing win over the Vikings on Thursday to get back on track, showcasing they are still in the AFC West race. Wins over the Chiefs and Broncos do help the Chargers in the division race, and are the early tiebreakers they can sit on. Los Angeles can make a run in November with two AFC South teams on the schedule. 7. Kansas City Chiefs (5-3)Remaining schedule: at Bills, Bye, at Broncos, vs. Colts, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, vs. Chargers, at Titans, vs. Broncos, at RaidersA win over the Commanders on Monday night allowed the Chiefs to leapfrog the Jaguars (4-3) for the No. 7 seed in the AFC. Kansas City is a game out of the AFC West race, with a loss to Los Angeles in hand. The Chiefs have won five of six and appear destined to make another Super Bowl run.Who's in and who's out?The Chiefs (5-3) appear primed to take a playoff spot, but Los Angeles and Denver deserve a lot of credit for holding serve and winning this week as well. Three AFC West teams look likely to make the playoffs. The Patriots and Bills are still battling it out for the AFC East, and both of those teams should make the playoffs. The Ravens (2-5) had a big win over the Bears to stay alive in the AFC North race, especially with the Steelers falling to the Packers in Week 8. The Steelers still have a commanding lead in the division, but the Ravens are getting Lamar Jackson back and Pittsburgh has to play Baltimore twice. The Bengals (3-5) took a massive hit for their division chances by losing to the Jets. The Colts have control of the AFC South, but the Texans (3-4) are lurking for a playoff spot as the No. 9 seed. Jacksonville (4-3) still have a shot at the wild card. There is a playoff spot up for grabs in the AFC, but it appears the AFC West is getting three teams in. Houston would likely have to win the AFC South to get in, but Denver and Los Angeles are on the schedule (Broncos next week). Here are the early predictions for the AFC playoff teams though the Sunday slate of games in Week 8:Colts (AFC North)Chiefs (AFC West)Bills (AFC East)Steelers (AFC North)Patriots (wild card)Broncos (wild card)Chargers (wild card)  NFC playoff picture    RankTeamWLTPCT1Packers511.7862Eagles620.7503Buccaneers620.7504Seahawks520 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7145Lions520.7146Rams520.714749ers530.6251. Green Bay Packers (5-1-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Panthers, vs. Eagles, at Giants, vs. Vikings, at Lions, vs. Bears, at Broncos, at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsThe Packers took care of business against the Steelers in a matchup of division leaders, holding onto the No. 1 seed. The Eagles aren't going anywhere in the NFC, so the Week 10 matchup could be for the top seed in the conference when all is said and done. Green Bay has a pretty easy schedule after Philadelphia. 2. Philadelphia Eagles (6-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, at Packers, vs. Lions, at Cowboys, vs. Bears, at Chargers, vs. Raiders, at Commanders, at Bills, vs. CommandersThe Eagles go into their bye week with a two-game lead over the Cowboys in the loss column with a head-to-head victory in hand. They have control of the NFC East, but the Week 10 matchup with the Packers and Week 11 showdown with the Lions loom large for home-field advantage. 3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, vs. Patriots, at Bills, at Rams, vs. Cardinals, vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersThe Buccaneers are in control in the NFC South, and gained a bigger lead with everyone else in the division falling in Week 8.  A loss to the Eagles hurts home-field advantage chances, but the Buccaneers do have an easy schedule after back-to-back games against the Patriots and Bills.4. Seattle Seahawks (5-2)Remaining schedule: at Commanders, vs. Cardinals, at Rams, at Titans, vs. Vikings, at Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersThe Seahawks had their bye week and took over the division lead with the 49ers falling to the Texans. Two games against the Rams and a rematch with the 49ers will be fun, as the NFC West is a brutal division. Three teams from the NFC West may make the playoffs. 5. Detroit Lions (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Vikings, at Commanders, at Eagles, vs. Giants, vs. Packers, vs. Cowboys, at Rams, vs. Steelers, at Vikings, at BearsThe Lions retain the No. 5 seed with the Packers winning while they are on their bye. Detroit has losses to Green Bay and Kansas City, but the Lions are one of the more talented teams in the NFL. Their schedule looked rough on paper a week ago, but it got a bit easier. 6. Los Angeles Rams (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Saints, at 49ers, vs. Seahawks, vs. Buccaneers, at Panthers, at Cardinals, vs. Lions, at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsA tough schedule in November could decide the NFC West, but the Rams are right in the mix for the division. Los Angeles remains the No. 6 seed as it was idle this week. The Rams should have a wild card spot (at least) if Matthew Stafford stays healthy, as Los Angeles is a Super Bowl contender in the NFC. 7. San Francisco 49ers (5-3)Remaining schedule: at Giants, vs. Rams, at Cardinals, vs. Panthers, at Browns, Bye, vs. Titans, at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe 49ers have sustained injury after injury, and the injuries may have caught up with them after a Week 8 loss to the Texans. San Francisco lost the NFC West lead and fell to third in the division with that loss. The schedule is still very favorable, and the 49ers are 3-0 in the NFC West already. This is a still a playoff team, as no one outside the playoff picture seems to want a playoff spot. Who's in and who's out?The Packers remain in control of the NFC North, but Detroit is still within striking distance. This division may be settled by Thanksgiving, when Detroit faces Green Bay in the rematch. Both teams are in the playoffs regardless. Chicago (4-3) is also in the running for a playoff spot, currently possessing the No. 8 seed (half game out of the playoffs).The Buccaneers have full control of the NFC South. They'll win the division. The Eagles have control of the NFC East, but have back-to-back games against the Packers and Lions off the bye. A split would be massive for Philadelphia. The Commanders (3-5) and Cowboys (3-4-1) continue to lose ground on a wild card spot in a loaded NFC. \nThe NFC West is loaded, as two teams (Seahawks, Rams) are 5-2 through eight weeks. The 49ers are right there at 5-3, currently occupying the last playoff spot. The NFC North and NFC West could cancel each other out in the playoff race, as the NFC West matchups could involve some playoff reshuffling. Even though the Bears lost this week, don't count them out. The seven teams in right now? They may be the seven teams in come January, but Chicago is trying to crash the party. Here are the early predictions for the NFC playoff teams though the Sunday games in Week 8:\nEagles (NFC East)Lions (NFC North)Buccaneers (NFC South)Rams (NFC West)Packers (wild card)49ers (wild card)Seahawks (wild card)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "description": "\n        Carson Wentz has been placed on injured reserve and will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan",
    "body": "\n        Carson Wentz has been placed on injured reserve and will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Wentz made five starts this season for the Vikings in relief of starting quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who is expected to return to the lineup for this week's game against the Detroit Lions. Along with McCarthy, the Vikings' quarterback room consists of Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie who will now move up to the No. 2 spot on the depth chart. Brosmer, who started for the Minnesota Gophers last season, has made three relief appearances this season, going 5 of 8 passing for 42 yards. Wentz played with considerable pain in his left (non-throwing) shoulder for more than half of his five starts, according to the Vikings' website. The former Pro Bowl quarterback appeared to be in obvious pain during Minnesota's most recent game, a 37-10 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that saw Wentz leave before its conclusion. A 10-year veteran, Wentz won two of his first three starts for the Vikings while filling in for McCarthy, who suffered a high-ankle sprain during Minnesota's Week 2 loss to the Falcons. \nWentz sustained his shoulder injury during the first half of the Vikings' Week 5 win over the Browns in London. Despite the injury, Wentz stayed in the game and ultimately led a game-winning drive that included him going 9 of 9 passing while throwing the game-winning touchdown pass to Jordan Addison with 25 seconds left. After using the Vikings' Week 6 bye to rehab his injury, Wentz tried but was unable to lead the Vikings to wins in their subsequent games against the Eagles (his former team) and Chargers. He pleaded with Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell to remain in last week's game against the Chargers despite being sacked five times and clearly being in pain. Wentz did his best, but it'll now be up to McCarthy to help turn the Vikings' season around. Minnesota is currently 3-4 and in last place in the NFC North.\nWhat does this mean for Wentz's future?For all intents and purposes, Wentz's Vikings career is probably a wrap. He was brought in as emergency insurance, and he was called upon to a great degree in a short amount of time. But he was uneven in dire circumstances, and he was always going to be a short-term Band-Aid anyway. Only a flawless and near-undefeated run would've convinced Vikings brass to pivot all the way off the McCarthy experiment, which has hardly left the ground.More than that, Wentz's injury-fueled exit may also spell the end of the quarterback's NFL career. That's mostly a result of the physical wear and tear he suffered behind Minnesota's shaky front. Imperfect as he may have been handling the ball as Kevin O'Connell's point guard, he showed enough in his brief Vikings tenure to warrant another backup gig somewhere else. It's just that he's also nearing his mid-30s after a decade of NFL service and took such a visible toll this year.Considering he waited quite a while to land his last two backup gigs, it's possible Wentz could decide that he's had his fill of taking a beating on the NFL stage. Then again, his own rugged persistence is part of the reason he suffered such serious shoulder injuries at all; maybe his never-say-die mentality will be enough to have him angling for one last opportunity in 2026.\nWhat does this mean for the Vikings?For one, it underscores the cold reality that Minnesota simply wasn't prepared to weather such turmoil under center. None of the club's individual quarterback decisions -- letting Sam Darnold walk, declining to pursue Aaron Rodgers with full conviction, etc. -- was egregious on its own. But Wentz ended up becoming a sort of sacrificial lamb in the wake of McCarthy's unreadiness.What we don't talk enough about is the fact [Wentz was] at the center of Minnesota's conundrum -- to hurry McCarthy back or to pivot to undrafted rookie Max Brosmer? -- despite only joining the team on Aug. 24. Look, some quarterbacks can turn around and help a franchise stay afloat on a few days' notice (see: Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals, at least briefly). But the Bengals had Joe Burrow as their Plan A. The Vikings had McCarthy, a total unknown.What's done is done. The Vikings made 2025 about McCarthy. And then McCarthy sputtered out of the gate before going down (again). It should be no surprise, a few weeks later, they're hurting to get things under control at the quarterback position, not so unlike halfway through the 2023 season when Kirk Cousins was sidelined and O'Connell was left to squeeze what he could from Joshua Dobbs, another last-minute backup addition, and assorted leftovers.\n        \n            \n                Did the Vikings botch their QB situation? Reassessing Minnesota's now-bumpy bet on J.J. McCarthy, backup plans\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPractically, however, Wentz's move to injured all but ensures McCarthy will make his long-awaited return sooner rather than later. Visiting Detroit to take on the vaunted Lions in Week 9 probably isn't the launching pad the Vikings had in mind for their second-year signal-caller coming off injury, but then again, nothing has really gone according to plan at the position. McCarthy, meanwhile, may get somewhat of a pass if he isn't lights out in his first game(s) back. But he'll also be under serious pressure to make good on the 2025 campaign as Year 2 of his rookie contract quickly fades away.And if he can't stay on the field again? Brosmer, the former Golden Gophers prospect, may well be the next name we're discussing as the unfortunate face of the Vikings' offense.\n            ",

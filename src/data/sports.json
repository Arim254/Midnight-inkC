Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee has been in doubt all summer, with the star mulling the possibility of seeking greener pastures after another early playoff exit and serious questions about the Bucks' roster. Despite those rumblings, Antetokounmpo is in Milwaukee as training camp begins with a singular focus on trying to lead the Bucks to a second championship in 2025-26. </p><p>Antetokounmpo addressed the latest rumors Wednesday and insisted that while he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season, he reserves the right to change his mind in \"<a href=\"https://x.com/eric_nehm/status/1976003996268757136\" target=\"_blank\">six, seven months</a>\" if he feels like the team isn't headed in the right direction. </p><p>\"First of all, I haven't read that story. When the season starts, I try to get off social media and I try to focus on my craft and the team, but yeah, I've said this many times, I want to be in a situation that I can win and now I'm here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I believe in this team. I believe in my teammates. I'm here to lead this team to wherever we can go and it's definitely going to be hard. We're going to take it day-by-day, but I'm here. So all the extra stuff does not matter.\"</p><p>This is all you can really ask for as a Bucks fan, and Antetokounmpo has certainly earned the trust that he's going to put his full effort into this Bucks team as long as he's there. Antetokounmpo will use this season to figure out whether the team is in position to help him achieve his goals of winning another championship, and that puts ample pressure on coach Doc Rivers and the supporting cast in Milwaukee to deliver this year. </p>\n<p>What we don't know is where that threshold is for Antetokounmpo to believe he's being provided the opportunity to win. Do the Bucks need to make the Eastern Conference Final to give him that sense? Is there a scenario in which an earlier exit still instills enough confidence that they're on the right path? Only Antetokounmpo knows that, but for now, he's going to do everything in his power to give the Bucks the chance to hit that mark. We'll find out next summer whether they've succeeded. The Giannis question may be pushed to the back burner for this season, but it will be back in full force whenever their 2025-26 campaign ends. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

Los Angeles' road to a 2-0 series lead was more difficult as it defeated the Phillies 5-3 and 4-3 in Philadelphia. The Blue Jays, who are the No. 1 seed in the AL, demolished the Yankees 23-8 over the first two games of their matchup at home but squandered a five-run lead in Game 3 at New York and dropped a 9-6 decision.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> look to get back in the series when they host the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> in Game 3 as the WNBA Finals resume Wednesday.

The Brewers send <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117916/quinn-priester/\">Quinn Priester</a> (13-3, 3.32 ERA) to the mound, while the Cubs counter with fellow right-hander <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765806/jameson-taillon/\">Jameson Taillon</a> (11-7, 3.68), who worked four scoreless innings against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SD/san-diego-padres/\">San Diego Padres</a> in Game 3 of their NL Wild Card Series. The teams combined to reach double digits in runs in each of the first two games of this set, and the SportsLine Projection Model believes the scoring will continue as the Over hits in 72% of its simulations.

But they scored twice in the bottom of the frame and reigning AL MVP <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/\">Aaron Judge</a> belted a tying three-run homer in the fourth before <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507358/jazz-chisholm/\">Jazz Chisholm</a> Jr. launched a solo shot an inning later to give New York its first lead in the series, which it did not relinquish. New York hopes to send the ALDS back to Toronto for a decisive Game 5 behind rookie right-hander Cam Schlittler (4-3, 2.96), who registered 12 strikeouts and scattered five hits over eight scoreless innings against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Boston Red Sox</a> in Game 3 of their AL Wild Card Series. The Blue Jays will start Louis Varland (4-3, 2.97) less than 24 hours after the 27-year-old reliever served up the homers to Judge and Chisholm. The SportsLine Projection Model sees a close game, as its simulations say the Blue Jays cover the run line 62% of the time.</p><h3>Phillies at Dodgers</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 9:08 p.m. | <strong>Location:</strong> Los Angeles | <strong>TV:</strong> TBS |<strong> Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191273?irad=377812&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/mlb/game-forecast/MLB_20251008_PHI@LAD/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine picks</a> -- Model</strong>: Phillies +1.5 (-135) | <strong>Expert</strong>: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2133925/aaron-nola/\">Aaron Nola</a> Over 8.5 outs recorded (-122)</p><p>The Dodgers attempt to extend their winning streak that dates back to the regular season to 10 games and reach the NLCS for the seventh time in 10 years as they send <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29313209/yoshinobu-yamamoto/\">Yoshinobu Yamamoto</a> (12-8, 2.49) to the mound. Meanwhile, Philadelphia, which has lost nine of its last 11 playoff games, puts its season in the hands of Aaron Nola (5-10, 6.01). The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Phillies keeping it close, as they cover the run line in 66% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance has faith in Nola, believing the veteran right-hander will last at least three innings.</p><h2>WNBA best bets, where to watch</h2><h3>Aces at Mercury</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 8 p.m. | <strong>Location: </strong>Phoenix | <strong>TV:</strong> ESPN | <strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/stream/wnba/?irad=1707172&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p><p><strong><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/wnba-finals-picks-aces-vs-mercury-game-3-best-bets-from-proven-experts-for-wednesday-oct-8/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine pick</a></span> -- Experts</strong>: Mercury -2.5 first half</p><p>The Mercury lost the opener of each of their first two series this postseason before defeating the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty in three games and Minnesota in four. Phoenix dropped Game 1 of the Finals as well but was unable to bounce back immediately and finds itself in what basically is a must-win situation on its home court in this best-of-seven series. SportsLine WNBA experts Calvin Wetzel and Aaron Barzilai think the Mercury will recover from their poor 3-point shooting in Game 2 and perform well in the first half on Wednesday.</p><h2>NHL best bets, where to watch</h2><h3><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/BOS/boston-bruins/\">Bruins</a> at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/teams/WAS/washington-capitals/\">Capitals</a></h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 7:30 p.m. | <strong>Location: </strong>Washington, DC | <strong>TV:</strong> TNT | <strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191278?irad=409363&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nhl/game-forecast/NHL_20251008_BOS@WAS/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine picks</a> -- Model</strong>: Capitals -190 | <strong>Expert</strong>: Capitals -1 (-120)</p><p>The Bruins, who missed the playoffs last season for the first time since 2016, look to get off to a strong start this campaign. Washington got the better of Boston in 2024-25, winning two of their three matchups -- including the lone one at Capital One Arena. The SportsLine Projection Model has the Capitals opening the season with a home victory in 70% of its simulations, and Matt Severance believes Washington will cover the spread as he feels Boston is a shell of its former self.</p><h3>Kings at Golden Knights</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 10 p.m. | <strong>Location: </strong>Paradise, Nev. | <strong>TV:</strong> TNT | <strong>Stream:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191278?irad=409363&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (Try for free)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nhl/game-forecast/NHL_20251008_LA@LV/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine picks</a> -- Model</strong>: Kings +1.5 (-144) | <strong>Expert</strong>: Golden Knights -1 (-128)</p><p>Los Angeles captain <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/players/565682/anze-kopitars/\">Anze Kopitar's</a> final NHL season did not start well as the Kings lost their home opener against the Avalanche on Tuesday. The Golden Knights will be looking to hand Los Angeles its second loss in two nights after dropping three of the four meetings between the teams last season. The SportsLine Projection Model's simulations have the Kings covering the spread 64% of the time, but Severance likes Vegas to cover in Mitch Marner's debut with the team.</p><h2>CFB best bets, where to watch</h2><h3>Liberty at UTEP</h3><p><strong>Time:</strong> 8 p.m. | <strong>Location: </strong>El Paso, Tex. | <strong>TV:</strong> CBS Sports Network | <strong>Stream: </strong><a href=\"https://www.fubo.tv/welcome/leagues/191261?irad=399332&irmp=365718\" target=\"_blank\">Fubo</a> (try for free)</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/college-football/game-forecast/NCAAF_20251008_LIB@UTEP/\" target=\"_blank\">SportsLine pick</a> -- Model</strong>: Liberty -120</p><p>Both teams enter this matchup with 1-4 overall records and 0-1 marks during Conference USA play.

A total of 78 players -- 60 from the PGA Tour, nine from the Japan Golf Tour and nine exemptions -- will tee it up at Yokohama Country Club as the Bill Coore & Ben Crenshaw redesign takes center stage and hosts the 2025 Baycurrent Classic for the first time in its existence.</p><p>Featuring holes from both the East and West Courses, Yokohama Country Club will give players plenty to think about off the tee as the par 71 is your standard, tree-lined golf course often found in Japan. That should be good news for a couple of players with ties to the country as U.S. Ryder Cup members Xander Schauffele and Collin Morikawa make the trip overseas.</p><p>The world No. 4 looks to keep the momentum rolling from his Ryder Cup performance at Bethpage Black where he compiled a 3-1-0 record for the red, white and blue. Striking the ball better by the week as he continues to search for his form from 2024 that won him a couple of major championships, Schauffele has a great opportunity to get off the schnied in the same country where he slipped on the gold medal two Olympics ago.</p><p>Japan has been kind to Schauffele and Morikawa. A winner of the Zozo Championship two years ago, Morikawa, a two-time major champion, looks to return to the winner's circle for the first time since. Experiencing a sluggish 2025 by his standards, the reliable right hander can flip the switch before the holidays with another massive performance in Japan.</p>\n<p>Other Ryder Cup participants including Rasmus Højgaard as well as vice captains Alex Noren and Gary Woodland are slated to tee it up while Japan's own Hideki Matsuyama eyes another title in his native land. Wyndham Clark, Min Woo Lee, Sungjae Im, Max Homa and recent French Open winner Michael Kim all make the voyage over for what should be a highly contested tournament amid the FedEx Cup Fall.</p><h2>2025 Baycurrent Classic schedule</h2><p><strong>Dates:</strong> Oct. 9-12<br /><strong>Location:</strong> Yokohama Country Club — Yokohama, Japan<br /><strong>Par:</strong> 71 | <strong>Yardage:</strong> 7,315<br /><strong>Purse:</strong> $8,000,000</p>\n<h2>2025 Baycurrent Classic field, odds</h2><p><em>Odds via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/draftkings-promo-code/\">DraftKings Sportsbook</a></em></p><ul><li><strong>Xander Schauffele (10-1)</strong></li><li><strong>Collin Morikawa (16-1):</strong> It has not been the 2025 season that Morikawa has envisioned, but that can change over the course of 72 holes. Still the eighth ranked player in the Official World Golf Rankings, Morikawa should relish the opportunity at hand given his acumen for tight, tree-lined golf courses. His play at the Ryder Cup remained uninspiring, but with a hefty diet of fairways and greens likely in his future, Morikawa can feast if the putter cooperates.</li><li><strong>Hideki Matsuyama (18-1):</strong> A winner of this tournament back in 2021, Matsuyama will hope to channel that same energy this week as he searches for his first top 10 finish since the first week of the calendar year. Doubling as a win at the Sentry, Matsuyama's performance at Kapalua has yet to be replicated by the methodical right hander. His iron play looked the part en route to his T13 finish at the BMW PGA Championship, but his driver remains a bit of a mystery. He will need to solve that this week to give the local crowds something to cheer about.</li><li><strong>Chris Gotterup (20-1)</strong></li><li><strong>Alex Noren (20-1):</strong> One of the hottest players in the world at the moment, Noren comes into the Baycurrent Classic a winner in two of his last three tournaments. Emerging from a playoff at Wentworth for his second career BMW PGA Championship title, the Swede is brimming with confidence as his iron play has turned a corner to match the effectiveness he has always possessed on the greens.</li><li><strong>Rasmus Højgaard (22-1):</strong> While Luke Donald did not run him often at Bethpage Black, Højgaard is galloping with the best of them at the moment. The Dane took no time off following his Ryder Cup debut and rolled into the Sanderson Farms Championship in need of a quality outing for his status on the PGA Tour. Ask and you shall received as the big-hitting right hander cashed a T3 result to move up to No. 75 in the FedEx Cup standings. He now has three podium finishes in his last five tournaments around the world.</li><li><strong>Kurt Kitayama (22-1)</strong></li><li><strong>Si Woo Kim (25-1)</strong></li><li><strong>Kevin Yu (28-1)</strong></li><li><strong>Min Woo Lee (30-1):</strong> The missed cut at the Sanderson Farms Championship put an end to a mini run of form for the electric Australian. Finishing T11 at the BMW PGA Championship, Lee followed it up with a contention run at the French Open where he ultimately settled for a T5 result. He has plenty to play for this week and the remainder of the year when accounting for the Aon Next 10 (Nos. 51-60 in the FedEx Cup standings) where he stands at No. 57 and the year-end top 50 in the OWGR cutoff for major championship invitations where he currently sits as the world No. 43.</li></ul><h2>2025 Baycurrent Classic picks</h2><div><table><tbody><tr><td><br /></td><td><div>\n    <div>\n                        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/2237304/xander-schauffele/\">\n                        <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/04/09/34cfeaca-d669-4f26-8492-0d2cc5c1a446/thumbnail/100x100/9d3ee3c5b13db4584ab33526d4300741/2237304.png\" /></figure>\n                                            </div>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p><span>\n                    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/2237304/xander-schauffele/\">\n                Xander Schauffele\n                    </a>\n            </span>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Winner (10-1):</strong> It's been said all year that Schauffele is close, and I am willing to wager he is indeed on the doorstep of some serious form. One of the few bright spots for the U.S. team at Bethpage Black, Schauffele showed his game can translate on the biggest stages. He finished his year by missing the Tour Championship but had just finished inside the top 10 at both the Scottish Open and The Open. From tee-to-green, he remains elite. Schauffele needs only a ho-hum week on the greens to contend for his first title in over a year. He's been hard at work all year trying to figure out the putter.</td></tr><tr><td><br /></td><td><div>\n    <div>\n                        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/2065269/max-homa/\">\n                        <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/04/10/c4ece133-5e4c-4892-8b63-b71cd545e30b/thumbnail/100x100/8e5f78cff884cdd7fe4865ad3d5592da/2065269.png\" /></figure>\n                                            </div>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p><span>\n                    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/2065269/max-homa/\">\n                Max Homa\n                    </a>\n            </span>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Contender (35-1):</strong> Finished the 2025 PGA Tour regular season with only two top 20s and has already matched that total across two tournaments in the FedEx Cup Fall. He continues to make in roads with his full swing -- specifically with the scoring clubs -- and his driver is slowly but surely following suit. When he sniffs contention, Homa has the uncanny ability of finding the winner's circle given his proficiency as a closer. In a small field at this number, the six-time winner can contend.</td></tr><tr><td><br /></td><td><div>\n    <div>\n                        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/3166793/tom-kim/\">\n                        <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"player headshot\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/04/05/f83059d4-9a0c-40f5-bfa3-a4ced5c1151f/thumbnail/100x100/56b25d0ebefc3a313c8d7906ce7f67b1/3166793.png\" /></figure>\n                                            </div>\n                    </a>\n    </div>\n            <div>\n    <p><span>\n                    <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/players/3166793/tom-kim/\">\n                Tom Kim\n                    </a>\n            </span>\n            </p></div>\n        </div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sleeper (60-1):</strong> Flashed a little bit of something at the Sanderson Farms Championship where he finished T11 -- his second top 20 of the calendar year. Ball striking has largely been up and down but motivation will be there. Kim has dropped to No. 86 in the world and is just inside the top 100 in the FedEx Cup standings where an invitation to the Players Championship is on the line. </td></tr></tbody></table></div>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n                                            </div>",

He is a two-time national champion, and two of three coaches ranked ahead of him -- Kirby Smart of Georgia and Ryan Day of Ohio State -- have also won national titles.</p><p>But in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football's</a> exclusive $11 million club, there is one head-scratcher. Fourth-year USC coach Lincoln Riley slots in at No. 3 overall in total pay at $11.5 million, despite the fact that he's yet to lead USC to a conference title or College Football Playoff appearance.</p><p>Those shortcomings for Riley underscore the significance of the two-week stretch that lies ahead for the 42-year old former Oklahoma coach. First up is a physical test against No. 15 Michigan followed by a rivalry showdown on the road against No. 16 Notre Dame.</p><p>After going just 13-11 over the past two seasons, Riley looks like one of college football's most egregiously overpaid coaches. However, wins against the Wolverines and Fighting Irish would bulldoze that notion and eradicate the narrative that Riley's teams are soft.

This is an incredible amount of money to shell out for a quarterbacks coach who has rarely, if ever, fielded a team with the physicality required to compete for a national championship. Riley can rewrite the narrative over the next two weeks against Michigan and Notre Dame. But until he does, he's an easy fit in the overpaid category.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UNC/north-carolina-tar-heels/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/742.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Bill Belichick, North Carolina <br />No. 9 ($10.1 million) <br /></strong>If North Carolina's decision makers abide by the policy that any publicity is good publicity, then hiring Bill Belichick has been a smashing success. If they were more interested in fielding a quality football team, then it's been an absolute disaster. That he's paid significantly more than Miami's Mario Cristobal and Indiana's Curt Cignetti seems particularly absurd, as both those coaches are leading unbeaten teams ranked in the top 10.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LIB/liberty-flames/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/662.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Jamey Chadwell, Liberty<br />No. 44 ($5.9 million)<br /></strong>Chadwell surged into coaching stardom during a wildly successful run with Coastal Carolina that made him a popular name on Power Four hot boards. Instead, he became the highest-paid coach in the Group of Six at Liberty and inherited a successful program from Hugh Freeze. But the Flames are now embroiled in a rapid decline. Since a 13-1 debut campaign for Chadwell in 2023 capped by a Fiesta Bowl trip, the Flames are just 9-8. They are off to a 1-4 start in 2025, and all of those losses are by 10+ points. Those are some massive paychecks for bad G6 results.</p><h2>Raises coming</h2><p>Based on hot starts in 2025, these coaches are in line for raises.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/687.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Mario Cristobal, Miami<br />No. 17 ($8.3 million)<br /></strong>It took a second, but Cristobal has Miami humming in Year 4. The Hurricanes are the runaway favorite to win the ACC and are a bona fide national title contender. Barring a significant collapse from his team, Cristobal should expect a significant bump for 2026. Only nine coaches <a href=\"https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/football/coach\" target=\"_blank\">in the database</a> are surpassing $10 million in total pay this year. Given how things are going in Coral Gables, Cristobal should probably be in that club next season. He was overpaid while going 12-13 over his first two seasons, but Cristobal is finally showing that prying him away from Oregon was worth it.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/759.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Brent Venables, Oklahoma<br />No. 23 ($7.5 million)<br /></strong>So much of Oklahoma's success -- and consequently the perception of Venables' tenure -- seems to be riding on the successful return of quarterback John Mateer. If the Washington State transfer is healthy enough to guide the Sooners into the CFP, then look for Venables to get a nice bump. His defense is absolutely filthy, and the hire of offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle (also from Washington State) has paid immediate dividends. The remaining schedule is treacherous, but Venables is looking like a coach who should be better-compensated than Kentucky's Mark Stoops.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/854.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Mike Elko, Texas A&M<br />No. 32 ($7 million)<br /></strong>After Jimbo Fisher's disastrous tenure and subsequent record-setting buyout, it's no wonder Texas A&M didn't go right back to paying eight figures for a football coach. But if what we're seeing so far from Elko is any indication, he may be commanding that sort of salary soon. The Aggies are 5-0 (2-0 SEC) with a win at Notre Dame under their belt entering a home showdown this week against Florida. Signs of improvement were evident in Elko's first season, and even more are materializing in 2025.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UVA/virginia-cavaliers/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/884.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Tony Elliott, Virginia<br />No. 54 ($4.4 million)<br /></strong>Virginia is 5-1 (3-0 ACC), ranked for the first time since 2019 and has already earned its first home win over a top-10 team in 20 years. It would be fair to surmise that a bump in pay is heading Elliott's way. The Cavaliers shouldn't go crazy here, because no one else is busting down the doors to hire Elliott. But he's taking advantage of a favorable schedule and showing legitimate progress.</p>\n<h2>Will they pay?</h2><p>The following coaches are interesting case studies. Their performance is deserving of a bump. But how much are their current schools willing/able to pay?</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARIZST/arizona-state-sun-devils/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/468.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Kenny Dillingham, Arizona State<br />No. 25 ($7.4 million)<br /></strong>Dillingham didn't play football for Arizona State, but he did attend ASU and start his collegiate coaching journey there. The school gave him a raise of nearly $2 million annually after he guided the Sun Devils to a Big 12 title and CFP appearance last season. Though he still ranks just 25th in total pay among those included in the database, he's already up to second in the Big 12 behind Deion Sanders at Colorado. </p><p>At 35, Dillingham is extraordinarily young to be a Power Four head coach and has plenty of time to rise the charts. If the Sun Devils remain perennial Big 12 contenders under his direction, it's only a matter of time before a big-time Big Ten or SEC school tries to make Dillingham a member of the $10 million club.</p>\n<div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWAST/iowa-state-cyclones/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/635.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Matt Campbell, Iowa State<br />No. 47 ($5 million)<br /></strong>Campbell is in Year 10 at Iowa State and is just one victory away from securing an eighth bowl bid. Last year's 11-3 record signified a program-record for victories, and the Cyclones could match that mark in 2025. He's still just 45 and has proven over the past decade that he's one of the sport's premier program builders. Yet, Campbell's salary languishes behind many of his Big 12 peers and would be 14th in the SEC.</p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/859.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Joey McGuire, Texas Tech<br />No. 51 ($4.5 million)<br /></strong>If Texas Tech wins the Big 12 and reaches the College Football Playoff, it will be interesting to see how McGuire is rewarded. The Red Raiders' improvement can be traced directly to a blockbuster spending spree on talent. Though McGuire is the coach and certainly deserving of credit for directing the on-field product, he's not a program-defining leader in the same way that most coaches of top-10 teams are. There's no doubt he's destined for a raise, but is a Texas Tech program that's determined to spend big on talent also willing to spend big on coaching? </p><div>\n                            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VANDY/vanderbilt-commodores/\">\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/882.svg\" /></figure>\n                                                </a>\n                    </div>\n    <p><strong>Clark Lea, Vanderbilt<br />No. 57 ($3.7 million)<br /></strong>While quarterback Diego Pavia is the heart and soul of the Vanderbilt program, Lea is the architect and has done a great job of building out a competitive roster around Pavia. Vandy is Lea's alma mater, and it's no secret that adores the university and that the job holds deep personal significance. But money talks, and there could soon be administrators who would be interested in doubling Lea's pay to get him out of Nashville and moving on up the coaching ladder.</p>\n<h2>Buyout bonanza</h2><p>Kirby Smart's buyout is the only nine-figure sum in the database at $105.1 million. Not that Smart needs a buyout to boost his job security as he has Georgia among the titans of the sport, but it would be nice knowing it would cost your employer <em>over $100 million to fire you</em>. Perhaps that type of money is going to <a href=\"https://dawnofthedawg.com/kirby-smart-shares-intimate-details-about-when-he-could-retire\" target=\"_blank\">keep the 49-year-old Smart from ever retiring early</a>, which he seems to float annually. </p><p> Among the notable names with buyouts of $35+ million are Kentucky's Mark Stoops ($37.7 million), Penn State's James Franklin ($48.7 million) and Clemson's Swinney ($60 million). Things aren't going well for those programs, but making moves would be extraordinarily expensive.</p>\n            </div>",

The Trojans were one win away from the College Football Playoff in Riley's first season back in 2022, but regressed in the two years since as defensive struggles and inconsistency kept USC from breaking through on the national stage.

Gary Parrish and Matt Norlander polled roughly 100 coaches in recent weeks on a variety of subjects. Coaches spoke on background and were provided anonymity to offer unfiltered opinions. This is the second installment in our 2025 survey.</em></p><hr /><p>Media outlets often publish a list of the best coaches in college basketball that's shaped largely by publicly available information like wins and championships. Those are always subjective but also pretty easy to do with more or less the same names slotted near the top each time.</p><p>But who are the good guys?</p><p>Not just good <em>coaches </em>but also good <em>men</em>, you know, the type of people you wouldn't mind your son playing for someday, and spending four years with someday, if he developed into a legitimate basketball prospect. A random person probably has no grasp for how to answer that question without real relationships throughout the sport. But do you know who has real relationships throughout the sport?</p><p> Coaches!</p>\n<p>So, with that in mind, Matt Norlander and I asked more than 100 college coaches the following question:</p><h2>If your son were a player, which college coach would you want him to spend four years with?</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Matt Painter (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/PURDUE/purdue-boilermakers/\">Purdue</a>)</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Tom Izzo (Michigan State)</td><td>16%</td></tr><tr><td>Kelvin Sampson (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a>)</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Rick Barnes (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a>)</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Mark Few (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/GONZAG/gonzaga-bulldogs/\">Gonzaga</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Dusty May (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MICH/michigan-wolverines/\">Michigan</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Mark Pope (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/UK/kentucky-wildcats/\">Kentucky</a>)</td><td>4%</td></tr><tr><td>Tommy Lloyd (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/ARIZ/arizona-wildcats/\">Arizona</a>)</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Shaka Smart (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/MARQET/marquette-golden-eagles/\">Marquette</a>)</td><td>3%</td></tr><tr><td>Scott Drew (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a>)</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Todd Golden (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a>)</td><td>2%</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>(</em><strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong><em>A list of more than a dozen coaches accounted for the other 21% of the vote.)</em></p><h2>Quotes that stood out</h2><h3>On Matt Painter:</h3><ul><li>\"He's like a brother to me. [He's] one of the most genuine, well-spoken, compassionate, empathetic [people]. Elite thinker [and] elite coach who has produced with less and ... his player-development, and how he gets these kids to stay, is amazing to me. He's a really, really good human being.\"</li><li>\"Excellent coach. Better person. Man of integrity. Tells his players what they need to hear, not what they want to hear. Genuinely cares about his program and the game of college basketball. Players have a great understanding of their job.\"</li><li>\"His program is at the highest level and has shown that they are doing the right things to retain players. So they are having a great experience, will develop and get better, and will always hear the truth.\"\t</li></ul><h3>On Tom Izzo:</h3><ul><li>\"Izzo embraces old school and new school. He teaches the game the right way -- and I think he has the ultimate respect of his players. You get coach Izzo for life if you play for him.\"</li><li>\"If he wants to coach four more years, and God only knows why he would want to, the answer for me is Izzo. While I genuinely think the \"leader of men\" thing is bullcrap when it comes to coaches raising players, Izzo is close to it, and his players tend to love him and always return to the program.</li><li>\"Tom Izzo is 'old school' in a good way, a way most college kids need/want. His players develop on the court, they win and, more importantly, they become a member of a family for life. At least from my perspective, that seems real. And if it were my son, I would want that for him.</li></ul><h2>The takeaway<br /></h2><p>Now that the 2025 Candid Coaches series has concluded it's fair to suggest that nobody had a better few weeks in it than Matt Painter and Purdue. While polling coaches, we learned that they believe the Boilermakers will be the best team this season and that Purdue point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/players/28954688/braden-smith/\">Braden Smith</a> will be <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">the best player</a></span>. Coaches also described Painter as the <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-is-the-best-xs-and-os-coach-in-college-basketball-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">best Xs and Os coach</a></span> in the sport and among the favorites to next become a first-time national champion. And now they've told us that, if they had a son heading off to play college basketball, the person they'd most trust to provide a great and valuable experience is Painter.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Candid Coaches: Who will be the best college basketball player in 2025-26?</p>\n                <p>\n                    Matt Norlander                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Candid Coaches: Who will be the best college basketball player in 2025-26?\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/25/dca6c3fa-b537-44e9-924c-e610b7e128cb/thumbnail/270x152/f825ae894924dfd9112258855c191310/cc-sept26-v1.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>None of this is surprising.</p>\n<p>The truth is that there are a lot of excellent coaches running great programs who double as good dudes -- but it was not surprising to see Painter lead all vote-getters when this question was asked. For lack of a better way to put it, people just really like and enjoy him. I don't mean to paint him as a saint, if only because I don't personally know any saints (and that seems like a weird place to set the bar). But what I can tell you is that in 20-plus years of covering college basketball, I don't think I've ever heard another coach say anything derogatory about Painter. He's both broadly respected as a coach and generally liked as a man. Not everybody in this sport checks those boxes while also being on track to someday become a Naismith Memorial Hall of Famer. But Painter clearly does, and the results of this final Candid Coaches question of 2025 illustrates as much.</p><h2>Previous 2025 Candid Coaches questions</h2><ul><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-mens-college-basketball-team-this-season/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best men's college basketball team this season?</a></span></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-what-percentage-of-your-schools-revenue-sharing-should-go-to-mens-basketball/\" target=\"_blank\">What percentage of your school's revenue sharing should go to men's basketball?</a></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-will-be-the-best-college-basketball-player-in-2025-26/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the best college basketball player this season?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-who-is-the-best-xs-and-os-coach-in-college-basketball-right-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Who is the best X's and O's coach in college basketball?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-school-made-the-best-college-basketball-coaching-hire-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">Which school made the best college basketball coaching hire in 2025?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-do-you-trust-that-your-competitors-will-follow-new-recruiting-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">Do you trust that your competitors will follow the new recruiting rules?</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/candid-coaches-which-college-basketball-coach-will-be-next-to-win-their-first-ncaa-tournament-title/\" target=\"_blank\">Who will be the next coach to win his first national championship?</a></span></li></ul>\n            </div>\n    </div>\n</article>\n        </div>\n                        </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The MLS 22 under 22 list has been unveiled, showcasing the best young talent in the league with Seattle Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas leading the way. Vargas is the first Mexican player to top the list after getting his first cap for El Tri in October of 2024 against the United States, which he was also eligible to represent, and spent time during his youth career in their setup. Vargas has three goals and five assists in MLS play, starting 26 matches for the Sounders so far at only 20, continuing on a breakout 2024 where he became a regular starter for the club.</p><p>The list, which is voted on by a panel of MLS coaches, general managers, on-air talent, and media, has been a staple in the league since 2010, with winners of this award regularly going on to have success in other leagues as well as MLS. That's where the intrigue comes in for Vargas and other players who made the top 22, like Alex Freeman, who is on track to make the World Cup squad representing the United States.</p><h2>MLS' 22 under 22 for 2025</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Player</th><th>Club</th><th>Age</th><th>Academy(s)</th></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>Obed Vargas</p></td><td><p>Seattle Sounders FC</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Seattle Sounders FC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>Alex Freeman</p></td><td><p>Orlando City SC</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Orlando City SC, Weston FC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>Idan Toklomati</p></td><td><p>Charlotte FC</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Maccabi Peta Tikva</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>Owen Wolff</p></td><td><p>Austin FC</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Austin FC, Atlanta United, Columbus Crew</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>David Martinez</p></td><td><p>Los Angeles FC</p></td><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Monagas SC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>Quinn Sullivan</p></td><td><p>Philadelphia Union</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Philadelphia Union</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>Peyton Miller</p></td><td><p>New England Revolution</p></td><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>New England Revolution, Oakwood SC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>Nathan Ordaz</p></td><td><p>Los Angeles FC</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Los Angeles FC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>Luca Bombino</p></td><td><p>San Diego FC</p></td><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Los Angeles FC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>Zavier Gozo</p></td><td><p>Real Salt Lake</p></td><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Real Salt Lake</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>Chris Brady</p></td><td><p>Chicago Fire FC</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Chicago Fire FC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>Noah Allen</p></td><td><p>Inter Miami</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Inter Miami, Weston FC</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>Olwethu Makhanya</p></td><td><p>Philadelphia Union</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>Kevin Kelsy</p></td><td><p>Portland TImbers</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Mineros de Guayana</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>Manu Duah</p></td><td><p>San Diego FC</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Santa Barbara Soccer Club</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Julian Fernandez</p></td><td><p>New York City FC</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Velez Sarsfield</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Ilay Feingold</p></td><td><p>New England Revolution</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Maccabi Haifa</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Frankie Westfield</p></td><td><p>Philadelphia Union</p></td><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Philadephia Union </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Nicolas Romero</p></td><td><p>Minnesota United FC</p></td><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Atletico Tucuman</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20</p></td><td>Darren Yapi<br /></td><td><p>Colorado Rapids</p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Colorado Rapids</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>21</p></td><td><p>Brooklyn Raines</p></td><td><p>Houston Dynamo </p></td><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Houston Dynamo, Barca Residency Academy</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>22</p></td><td><p>Taha Habroune</p></td><td><p>Columbus Crew</p></td><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Columbus Crew</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>What's interesting is the range of backgrounds here. There are 14 homegrown players listed, but even how they got to MLS clubs sees plenty of paths with more scouting of smaller academies and younger players abroad. The impact of MLS's U-22 initiative can even be seen with players like Makhanya being able to be fit under the salary cap before going on to play a major role in a Supporters' Shield victory. </p>\n<p>The Union have the most representatives in the list with three, as head coach Bradley Carnell has trusted in his younger players and it has paid off to great effect. MLS Next Pro has been able to provide a place for these players to get game experience, as well as for clubs to put younger players to play while they adjust to transitioning to MLS, which Charlotte FC did with Toklomati. But to look at what these players could accomplish, let's take a look at the previous winners.</p><h2>All-time winners</h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Year</th><th>Player</th><th>Club</th><th>Current Club</th></tr><tr><td><p>2025</p></td><td><p>Obed Vargas</p></td><td><p>Seattle Sounders</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>2024</p></td><td><p>Diego Gomez</p></td><td><p>Inter Miami</p></td><td><p>Brighton</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2023</p></td><td><p>Alan Velasco</p></td><td><p>FC Dallas</p></td><td><p>Boca Juniors</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2022</p></td><td><p>Jesus Ferreira</p></td><td><p>FC Dallas</p></td><td><p>Seattle Sounders</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2021</p></td><td><p>Ricardo Pepi</p></td><td><p>FC Dallas</p></td><td><p>PSV</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2020</p></td><td><p>Brenden Aaronson</p></td><td><p>Philadelphia Union</p></td><td><p>Leeds United</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2019</p></td><td><p>Diego Rossi</p></td><td><p>Los Angeles FC</p></td><td><p>Columbus Crew</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2018</p></td><td><p>Alphonso Davies</p></td><td><p>Vancouver Whitecaps FC</p></td><td><p>Bayern Munich</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2017</p></td><td><p>Miguel ALmiron</p></td><td><p>Atlanta United</p></td><td><p>Atlanta United</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2016</p></td><td><p>Cyle Larin</p></td><td><p>Orlando City FC</p></td><td><p>Feyenoord</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2015</p></td><td><p>Fabian Castillo</p></td><td><p>FC Dallas</p></td><td><p>Deportivo Cali</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2014</p></td><td><p>DeAndre Yedlin</p></td><td><p>Seattle Sounders</p></td><td><p>Real Salt Lake</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2013</p></td><td><p>Darlington Nagbe</p></td><td><p>Portland Timbers</p></td><td><p>Columbus Crew</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2012</p></td><td><p>Darren Mattocks</p></td><td><p>Vancouver Whitecaps FC</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2011</p></td><td><p>Brek Shea</p></td><td><p>FC Dallas</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2010</p></td><td><p>Fredy Montero</p></td><td><p>Seattle Sounders</p></td><td><p>Real Cartagena</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is serious company for Vargas to join. From players who have gone on to have excellent MLS careers to regulars in their national teams, with plenty of Champions League experience in between. The Sounders have had a history of developing talent, which is shown by Vargas' win, putting them two behind FC Dallas for the all-time lead in this list, but as MLS has grown as a selling league, the opportunities opened to players to top this list havee also grown.</p>\n<p>It didn't take long for Diego Gomez to break into the first team at Brighton after joining from Inter Miami, and clubs abroad are seeing how MLS is preparing players for top leagues. Miguel Almiron and Alphonso Davies may have been trailblazers at the time, joining Newcastle United and Bayern Munich respectively, but more players will continue to translate success in MLS at such a young age into success abroad. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>The potential 2026 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/draft/\">NFL draft</a> class was a relatively thin one during my summer scouting watch. With only a handful of first-round grades based on last year's tape, it's no surprise we've seen plenty of leapfrogging with some prospects making big leaps into the first-round conversation and others backsliding.</p><div><p>No position has seen more improvement than wide receiver, which is now the most represented position in my top 50 with eight prospects making the cut. While no quarterback has solidified himself as the top dog just yet, there are a few who are within striking distance of becoming the No. 1 overall pick by season's end. </p></div><h2>1. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125808/rueben-bain-jr/\">Rueben Bain Jr.</a>, EDGE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MIAMI/miami-fla-hurricanes/\">Miami (FL)</a></h2><p>The real sweepstakes in the 2026 draft class isn't at the quarterback position. It's Miami's Rueben Bain Jr. He's the type of game-changing prospect who might actually convince some team to do what the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CLE/cleveland-browns/\">Browns</a> did in 2017: pass on a quarterback at No. 1 for an edge rusher in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2139869/myles-garrett/\">Myles Garrett</a>. Bain is the most powerful defensive end prospect I've ever scouted and could even be seen as a defensive tackle by some.  <br /> </p><h2>2. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124883/peter-woods/\">Peter Woods</a>, DL, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CLEM/clemson-tigers/\">Clemson</a></h2><p>Woods is no slouch of a consolation prize in this class. He's another defensive lineman who's strong beyond his years. I haven't seen a college defensive tackle shed as violently in the running game since Derrick Brown at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/AUBURN/auburn-tigers/\">Auburn</a>. He's still not a refined pass-rusher, but there's so much to work with.  <br /> </p>\n<h2>3. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28916321/fernando-mendoza/\">Fernando Mendoza</a>, QB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IND/indiana-hoosiers/\">Indiana</a></h2><p>Mendoza has an NFL-translatable game with the stats to back it up this season. Watching his tape at Cal last year left you wondering what he'd look like with a real supporting cast. Well, now he has it at Indiana, and he's averaging 9.7 yards per attempt through five games.  <br /> </p><h2>4. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28900885/jordyn-tyson/\">Jordyn Tyson</a>, WR, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARIZST/arizona-state-sun-devils/\">Arizona State</a></h2><p>Tyson makes playing receiver look effortless. He's got some of the best body control you'll see from a prospect as a route-runner, and it allows him to consistently make defenders whiff at the line of scrimmage. He's already racked up 39 catches for 483 yards and seven scores in five games. <br /> </p><h2>5. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28898674/caleb-downs/\">Caleb Downs</a>, S, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OHIOST/ohio-state-buckeyes/\">Ohio State</a></h2><p>Downs could easily be the first safety drafted in the top 10 since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2131682/jamal-adams/\">Jamal Adams</a> in 2017. There are almost no holes to poke in his game physically and mentally. You don't start for Nick Saban as a true freshman defensive back the way Downs did unless you've got the goods. <br />  </p>\n<h2>6. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28895698/dante-moore/\">Dante Moore</a>, QB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OREG/oregon-ducks/\">Oregon</a></h2><p>Moore has passed every test to date, but numerous ones lie ahead to solidify his stock as a potential top 10 pick. He's a cool, calm and collected athlete who's got one of the prettiest throwing motions you'll see. My favorite stat from Moore early on this season is that on 32 pressured dropbacks, he's taken only one sack.  <br /> </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/dante-moore-2026-nfl-draft-scouting-report/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Dante Moore is rising fast -- Oregon QB now a serious name in No. 1 pick conversation for 2026 NFL Draft</p>\n                <p>\n                    Mike Renner                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Dante Moore is rising fast -- Oregon QB now a serious name in No. 1 pick conversation for 2026 NFL Draft\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/01/cbcb6a87-3539-4059-a29a-2ec04a868a17/thumbnail/270x152/183da2a344ebd128072a468c6cac7540/dante-moore.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>7. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29168249/jermod-mccoy/\">Jermod McCoy</a>, CB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TENN/tennessee-volunteers/\">Tennessee</a></h2><p>This ranking is a placeholder since it's based off last year's tape. McCoy tore his ACL in January and is still working his way back. While still not medically cleared, if he shows, even in a few games late in the season, that he's back to his pre-injury form, McCoy will be the best corner in the country. <br /> </p><h2>8. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29121984/francis-mauigoa/\">Francis Mauigoa</a>, OT, Miami (FL) </h2><p>Mauigoa is as dense an offensive tackle prospect as you'll ever see. He moves people consistently against their will. The three-year starter has gotten better every season, and particularly in pass protection this year with only five pressures allowed in five games. <br /> </p>\n<h2>9. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124417/spencer-fano/\">Spencer Fano</a>, IOL, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UTAH/utah-utes/\">Utah</a></h2><p>I held out hope that Fano could be a tackle going into this season, but what I've seen so far makes me think he's better suited at guard in the league. No matter, he'll be a darn good one on the interior for a long time. He's an elite zone-run blocker with exceptional burst and quicks. <br /> </p><h2>10. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125550/t-j-parker/\">T.J. Parker</a>, EDGE, Clemson </h2><p>Parker is a box-ticker at defensive end. He's got the frame (6-foot-3, 260 pounds), the power and the production (101 career pressures). There's not much more we need to see from him to know he can be an every-down player in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. <br /> </p><h2>11. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124411/carnell-tate/\">Carnell Tate</a>, WR, Ohio State </h2><p>Tate is next in the Ohio State receiver pipeline. Like seemingly all Buckeyes receivers, Tate makes it look so easy. That's a rarity for bigger receivers who possess a basketball frame like Tate. And don't let the size fool you; Tate is a big-play threat averaging 18.1 yards per reception this year. <br /> </p>\n<h2>12. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125790/keldric-faulk/\">Keldric Faulk</a>, EDGE, Auburn </h2><p>Faulk has the kind of versatile defensive line body type that everyone wants nowadays. He can play pretty much any alignment on a defense outside of nose tackle and not look out of place. While he's a work in progress as a pass-rusher, Faulk is already well versed in the run game.  <br /> </p><h2>13. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123901/avieon-terrell/\">Avieon Terrell</a>, CB, Clemson </h2><p>Terrell is the stickiest corner in the class with bloodlines the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> will love (brother of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ATL/atlanta-falcons/\">Falcons</a> cornerback A.J. Terrell). What I love is how physical he is for being only 180 pounds. Terrell has already forced three fumbles this year after forcing three last year.  <br /> </p><h2>14. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29128702/arvell-reese/\">Arvell Reese</a>, LB, Ohio State </h2><p>Reese has been one of the breakout stars of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a> season. The 6-foot-4, 243-pounder is precisely the kind of edge-hybrid whom everyone is looking to add to their blitz packages. His ability to track down ball-carriers in space at his size is special. <br /> </p>\n<h2>15. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26904572/chris-brazzell-ii/\">Chris Brazzell II</a>, WR, Tennessee </h2><p>Brazzell is a transfer portal success story. The rail-thin receiver we first saw break out for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULANE/tulane-green-wave/\">Tulane</a> in 2023 has since turned into a physically dominant mismatch who's tailor-made to play outside in Tennessee's offense. It seems like every week he's Moss-ing a different SEC corner. He's already racked up 531 yards and seven scores through five games.</p><h2>16. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133405/jeremiyah-love/\">Jeremiyah Love</a>, RB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ND/notre-dame-fighting-irish/\">Notre Dame</a></h2><p>Whether it's as a runner or receiver, Love is a big play waiting to happen. His twitch and speed is reminiscent of former first-rounder <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162723/jahmyr-gibbs/\">Jahmyr Gibbs</a>. That's the kind of weapon everyone is looking for at running back nowadays. <br /> </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/jeremiyah-love-2026-nfl-draft-scouting-report/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Jeremiyah Love is Notre Dame's next star RB -- and a top 2026 NFL Draft prospect</p>\n                <p>\n                    Josh Edwards                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Jeremiyah Love is Notre Dame's next star RB -- and a top 2026 NFL Draft prospect\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/26/bf0e5cf2-72df-4f53-b67f-fcea8baf223c/thumbnail/270x152/feb2a83764ce103add94a125366f8854/gettyimages-2233103694-1.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>17. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28901500/olaivavega-ioane/\">Olaivavega Ioane</a>, IOL, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/PSU/penn-state-nittany-lions/\">Penn State</a></h2><p>Ioane is the best true guard in the country by a wide margin. He's in his third year as a starter and has taken his game to another level this fall. After switching between left and right guard the past two seasons, he's been exclusively on the left side this year. He's allowed all of two pressures on 150 pass-blocking snaps. <br /> </p>\n<h2>18. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123772/makai-lemon/\">Makai Lemon</a>, WR, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/USC/usc-trojans/\">USC</a></h2><p>Lemon is this year's \"just draft him\" receiver. By that I mean he doesn't have elite physical traits that jump out at you, but when you flip on the tape he won't stop getting open and doesn't drop passes. He's the kind of savvy slot receiver who's increasing in value at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> level. <br />  </p><h2>19. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878022/david-bailey/\">David Bailey</a>, EDGE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXTECH/texas-tech-red-raiders/\">Texas Tech</a></h2><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/STNFRD/stanford-cardinal/\">Stanford</a> transfer is finally getting a shot at a full-time role and flourishing. He put up 13 pressures this past week against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/HOU/houston-cougars/\">Houston</a> and is almost at his pressure total from 2024 already. Bailey has the best first step in the class and easily the best speed-rusher available. <br /> </p><h2>20. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28915380/john-mateer/\">John Mateer</a>, QB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/OKLA/oklahoma-sooners/\">Oklahoma</a></h2><p>The Wazzu transfer with gaudy physical tools has finally gotten a supporting cast to show how high his ceiling is. While his game is rough around the edges, the improvements we've seen from him since early last fall are striking. If that continues after he's sidelined this month with a thumb injury, he could push for a top 10 selection when he declares. <br /> </p>\n<h2>21. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29154162/caleb-lomu/\">Caleb Lomu</a>, OT, Utah </h2><p>Lomu has the kind of quick feet and hands that stick out immediately in a sea of plodding offensive tackles at the collegiate level. It's the kind of combination that more often than not leads to high-end pass-protecting ability at the next level. He just needs to get a little stronger before that's the case.</p><h2>22. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26715531/jake-golday/\">Jake Golday</a>, LB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/CINCY/cincinnati-bearcats/\">Cincinnati</a></h2><p>This linebacker class is something special, and the sheer amount of physical freaks is a big reason why. Golday is yet another massive linebacker who moves like a safety and can rush the passer like an edge. He's averaging almost five defensive stops a game this season.</p><h2>23. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29151264/trevor-goosby/\">Trevor Goosby</a>, OT, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TEXAS/texas-longhorns/\">Texas</a></h2><p>Goosby was a spot starter last season who's taken over for Kelvin Banks Jr. at left tackle this year and kept a similar level of play. He's got a more prototypical tackle frame (6-foot-7 and 312 pounds) than Banks possesses and is a high-end athlete in his own right.  <br /> </p>\n<h2>24. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29128902/colton-hood/\">Colton Hood</a>, CB, Tennessee </h2><p>After sitting behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/28909849/travis-hunter/\">Travis Hunter</a> last year at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/COLO/colorado-buffaloes/\">Colorado</a>, Hood has been a breakout star for the Volunteers. He's allowed only seven catches on 19 targets for 56 yards in five games this season. When Jermod McCoy gets back across from him, not many teams will be throwing on this Tennessee defense. <br /> </p><h2>25. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28897667/kadyn-proctor/\">Kadyn Proctor</a>, IOL, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAMA/alabama-crimson-tide/\">Alabama</a></h2><p>Proctor is yet another prospect I'd hoped could stick at tackle, but I've now resigned myself to likely kicking him inside to guard. That's not the worst thing, as he'll be one of the scariest gap-scheme guards in short order. Proctor's ability to move people against their will at 366 pounds is unique. <br />  </p><h2>26. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26699728/cashius-howell/\">Cashius Howell</a>, EDGE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TXAM/texas-am-aggies/\">Texas A&M</a></h2><p>Howell is the best pure pass-rusher in the draft class. The question is just whether Howell's game will translate with under 31-inch arms and under 250 pounds. I'm still buying his quick twitch and refined set of moves being able to work against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> tackles. <br /> </p>\n<h2>27. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123538/matayo-uiagalelei/\">Matayo Uiagalelei</a>, EDGE, Oregon </h2><p>Uiagalelei is yet another power end who can set a hard edge and compress pockets. He already has 18 pressures this season in five games. Uiagalelei should also only be getting better, as he's one of the youngest prospects in the class who won't turn 21 years old until next July. <br /> </p><h2>28. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124528/cj-allen/\">CJ Allen</a>, LB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/UGA/georgia-bulldogs/\">Georgia</a></h2><p>Allen is one of the most ferocious linebackers in the country on tape. He comes downhill with bad intentions. He'll be a value add in the run game and as a blitzer from Day 1. <br /> </p><h2>29. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29120637/connor-lew/\">Connor Lew</a>, IOL, Auburn </h2><p>Lew is technically advanced beyond his years and has been starting since his true freshman year in 2023. He's a nimble and efficient center who will only get better as his play strength improves.  <br /> </p><h2>30. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28921209/max-klare/\">Max Klare</a>, TE, Ohio State </h2><p>With too many mouths to feed in the Buckeyes offense, Klare is not going to put up a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168800/tyler-warren/\">Tyler Warren</a> statline anytime soon. Flip on the tape, though, and you'll see a player who knows how to get open and has the body control to haul in off-target passes consistently. <br /> </p><h2>31. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29133533/quincy-rhodes-jr/\">Quincy Rhodes Jr.</a>, EDGE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARK/arkansas-razorbacks/\">Arkansas</a></h2><p>Rhodes has been a breakout star in his first year starting for the Razorbacks. He's got an ideal frame for the edge at 6-foot-6 and 275 pounds with long arms and good body control. Rhodes has been their most consistent pass-rusher this season with 19 pressures in five games. <br /> </p><h2>32. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28912011/joshua-josephs/\">Joshua Josephs</a>, EDGE, Tennessee </h2><p>Josephs is undersized, but he doesn't play like it. His ability to stack offensive tackles and shed blocks at 240 pounds is unique. He's a perfect fit for teams that use a 3-4 outside linebacker. <br /> </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/nfl-mock-draft-2026-first-round-quarterback-shakeup/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 2.0: Fernando Mendoza stays at QB1; breakout star Dante Moore lands with Steelers</p>\n                <p>\n                    Mike Renner                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 2.0: Fernando Mendoza stays at QB1; breakout star Dante Moore lands with Steelers\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/17/05965467-50b0-4194-b8c5-7982980173c7/thumbnail/270x152/82438777b3a7e7fab79b51070e405608/dante-moore-usatsi.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>33. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125433/kenyon-sadiq/\">Kenyon Sadiq</a>, TE, Oregon </h2><p>Sadiq is the most impressive specimen in the tight end class, and it shows most after the catch. He's broken 17 tackles on 45 career receptions for the Ducks. Now, he just needs to prove he can produce more as a downfield weapon instead of the schemed-touch guy he's been most of his career. <br /> </p><h2>34. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877196/chris-bell/\">Chris Bell</a>, WR, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LVILLE/louisville-cardinals/\">Louisville</a></h2><p>The proverbial light switch has flipped this season for one of the most physically impressive receivers in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>. Bell possesses elite burst at 6-foot-2 and 220 pounds, and now he has the route-running chops to take advantage of it. He has 502 yards on 35 catches in five games and has gone over 130 in each of the past two weeks. <br /> </p><h2>35. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28912466/emmanuel-mcneil-warren/\">Emmanuel McNeil-Warren</a>, S, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TOLEDO/toledo-rockets/\">Toledo</a></h2><p>McNeil-Warren is outstanding around the line of scrimmage. He could pass for a linebacker if you wanted him to, and his best role in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> may be as a big nickel who bridges the gap between corner and weakside linebacker.  <br /> </p><h2>36. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124624/eric-singleton-jr/\">Eric Singleton Jr.</a>, WR, Auburn</h2><p>Between <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/GATECH/georgia-tech-yellow-jackets/\">Georgia Tech</a> his first two seasons and Auburn this year, Singleton hasn't exactly been blessed with the best quarterback situations. There's a very good chance his NFL production will greatly outpace what he's done in college. That's because Singleton has some of the best pure twitchiness in the draft class yet has been relegated to an underneath weapon because his college quarterbacks haven't been able to hit him consistently downfield.  <br /> </p><h2>37. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28878532/ty-simpson/\">Ty Simpson</a>, QB, Alabama </h2><p>Since the Week 1 loss to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FSU/florida-state-seminoles/\">Florida State</a>, no quarterback has played the position better than Simpson. In his first year as a starter, he's looked poised and accurate beyond his years. Slotting him on this list is difficult this early on, but it's hard not to like what we've seen so far. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/college-football-qb-power-rankings-alabamas-ty-simpson-takes-no-1-nico-iamaleava-returns-to-top-50/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>College Football QB Power Rankings: Alabama's Ty Simpson takes No. 1, Nico Iamaleava returns to top 50</p>\n                <p>\n                    David Cobb                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"College Football QB Power Rankings: Alabama's Ty Simpson takes No. 1, Nico Iamaleava returns to top 50\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/48290fb7-58ce-427b-b279-8b771794ecdd/thumbnail/270x152/f42e45b40bcfc2a205357e8c23b43d36/ty-simpson-qb-power-rankings.png\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<h2>38. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28909269/sonny-styles/\">Sonny Styles</a>, LB, Ohio State</h2><p>Styles is one of the most athletic linebackers you'll ever see. Maybe that's not too surprising for a former safety, but it gets more surprising when you find out that former safety is 6-foot-4 and 243 pounds. That former safety also hasn't missed a tackle on 27 attempts this year. Styles is going to hawk down a lot of ball-carriers in the league.</p><h2>39. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29128875/kayden-mcdonald/\">Kayden McDonald</a>, DL, Ohio State </h2><p>You want to clog up gaps in the middle of your defense? This is the man to do it. In his first year as a starter, McDonald has been able to consistently reset the line of scrimmage in the run game. Even against double teams, McDonald has rarely ceded an inch on tape. <br /> </p><h2>40. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29137792/kade-pieper/\">Kade Pieper</a>, IOL, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/IOWA/iowa-hawkeyes/\">Iowa</a></h2><p>There's approximately a 0% chance that Pieper comes out. That's because this marks only his first season as a starter, and the redshirt sophomore is playing out of position at guard when his position in the NFL will be center. That being said, the talent is off the charts, as Pieper looks more athletic at the second level than a lot of the linebackers he's tasked with blocking. <br /> </p><h2>41. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28877253/josh-hoover/\">Josh Hoover</a>, QB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TCU/tcu-horned-frogs/\">TCU</a></h2><p>Hoover's tape is littered with NFL throws and high-level progression reads. There's some inconsistency with his accuracy and he can be overly aggressive, but he brings so much to the table to like as an athlete. Hoover has an NFL future, even if it's not quite this draft yet. <br /> </p><h2>42. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876020/parker-brailsford/\">Parker Brailsford</a>, IOL, Alabama </h2><p>Brailsford has looked like an NFL center ever since he first became a starter for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/WASH/washington-huskies/\">Washington</a> in 2023. It's just been about getting his play strength to an NFL level. He's knocking on the door of that this fall and is likely to make the leap after this season because of it despite one more year of eligibility.  <br /> </p><h2>43. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29124363/anthony-hill-jr/\">Anthony Hill Jr.</a>, LB, Texas </h2><p>Hill is a do-it-all linebacker who moves so easily in space. It's why he's been starting for the Longhorns since his true freshman year in 2023. Now he's seeing the game even faster than before and looks like an early-round pick. <br /> </p><h2>44. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28875368/denzel-boston/\">Denzel Boston</a>, WR, Washington </h2><p>Boston is pretty much exactly what comes to mind when you hear about a 6-foot-4, 210-pound receiver prospect. Big frame, great ball skills and long strides to get away from defensive backs.  <br /> </p><h2>45. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26720219/michael-trigg/\">Michael Trigg</a>, TE, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BAYLOR/baylor-bears/\">Baylor</a></h2><p>Trigg has one of the best tight end frames you'll ever see. At just a hair over 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds, Trigg somehow has a 7-foot wingspan. That's not a typo. Add in the fact that he leads all tight ends with 439 yards this season (114 more than the next-closest) and it's easy to see what there is to like about Trigg as a prospect. <br /> </p><h2>46. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876570/mansoor-delane/\">Mansoor Delane</a>, CB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/LSU/lsu-tigers/\">LSU</a></h2><p>Delane may not have the traits of a prototypical man corner, but he darn sure has the performance of one this season. Transferring from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/VATECH/virginia-tech-hokies/\">Virginia Tech</a> to LSU has done wonders for his draft stock. He's shown he can do it against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football's</a> best with only six catches for 77 yards allowed in five games. <br /> </p><h2>47. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28874750/bear-alexander/\">Bear Alexander</a>, DL, Oregon </h2><p>Talent has never been the issue with Alexander. His viral Instagram photo from last year donning a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DDptGjTy6lP/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Penn State jersey with a USC profile picture and a Georgia biceps tattoo </a> was indicative of the worst excesses in the portal era. The ironic thing is that he's now at a different school entirely (his seventh since 2018, including high schools) and just played the best game of his career against Penn State. He's a twitchy and powerful big man who's flashed first-round talent when he's locked in.</p><h2>48. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29123553/genesis-smith/\">Genesis Smith</a>, S, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/ARIZ/arizona-wildcats/\">Arizona</a></h2><p>Smith was always an NFL athlete at the position, and this year he started seeing the game develop like an NFL safety. He's been consistently making plays on the football with four pass-breakups and a pick in five games. He needs to clean up some missed tackles, but there's a lot to like early on.</p><h2>49. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28900921/omar-cooper-jr/\">Omar Cooper Jr.</a>, WR, Indiana </h2><p>Cooper has been a breakout star for the Hoosiers this season. Despite being primarily a slot, Cooper has been able to average a healthy 18.8 yards per reception on 23 catches. What I love most about his game is the work he does post-catch. With a running-back-esque build, Cooper already has 11 broken tackles this season.</p><h2>50. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29125012/hollywood-smothers/\">Hollywood Smothers</a>, RB, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NCST/nc-state-wolfpack/\">NC State</a> </h2><p>Despite being one of the coolest names in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">college football</a>, not many had heard of him prior this season. That's going to be changing after what Smothers has been doing to opposing defenses this fall. Smothers ranks second in the FBS with 693 rushing yards already this fall on 100 carries. He's yet another dynamic back who's difficult to pin down in space. </p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Heading into 2026, first base is in a marginally better position than it was a year ago. And that's almost entirely due to one man: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426033/nick-kurtz/fantasy/\">Nick Kurtz</a>. </p><p>First basemen as a whole had just a 107 wRC+ in 2024, the lowest mark since at least 2002. In 2025, that bounced back a bit to a 109 mark, though that is still the fourth-lowest mark at the position in that span. The number of legitimate four-category contributors at the position continues to shrink, and what might be most concerning is that the ones who remain are, by and large, on the wrong side of 30 or about to get there. </p><p>Among the top 10 finishers at first base in 2025, only Nick Kurtz, Vladimir Guerrero, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26747031/vinnie-pasquantino/fantasy/\">Vinnie Pasquantino</a> are younger than 28 (and Pasquantino turns 28 this offseason); raise that bar to 30, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165929/rafael-devers/fantasy/\">Rafael Devers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184448/josh-naylor/fantasy/\">Josh Naylor</a> make it, but that still means half of the top 10 are in their 30s. The era of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765052/paul-goldschmidt/fantasy/\">Paul Goldschmidt</a> dominating the position is clearly over, and the Bryce Harper/Freddie Freeman/Matt Olson/Pete Alonso group are at the age where rapid decline, while not <em>expected</em>, wouldn't exactly be surprising. </p><p>And we're still waiting for the changing of the guard. Kurtz did his part in 2025 and will be the consensus top option off draft boards in 2026 after hitting .290/.383/.619 as a 22-year-old rookie. Otherwise, we're seeing the results of some changing league-wide trends – better defensive position continues to flatten the positional curve even after the shift was limited, while the universal DH continues to push certain other players off first base who would likely have landed there otherwise – as well as a particularly poor crop of first base prospect outcomes over the past decade. </p>\n<p>Looking at the Top 101 prospects lists from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://baseballprospectus.com/\">BaseballProspectus.com</a> since the 2017, just half of the 28 players listed as first basemen have even gotten to 500 plate appearances in the majors. Allowing for the fact that some of them haven't really had the chance to establish themselves yet, we can just isolate from 2017 through 2023's lists, which sees all but four reaching that 500-PA marker. That's better.</p><p>However, just getting to 500 PA isn't what we're looking for; we're looking for impact bats, and that's where the first base prospects of recent years really fall short. Just nine of 16 have a career wRC+ of at least 100 (that's league average), and that number would be even lower without relative breakouts from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3166850/spencer-torkelson/fantasy/\">Spencer Torkelson</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117474/andrew-vaughn/fantasy/\">Andrew Vaughn</a> this season. Raise that bar to 110 – so, just above the average first baseman in 2025's down environment for the position – and we have just <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507341/yordan-alvarez/fantasy/\">Yordan Alvarez</a> (who hasn't really played 1B in the majors and isn't eligible for 2026 there), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2447476/pete-alonso/fantasy/\">Pete Alonso</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2942989/triston-casas/fantasy/\">Triston Casas</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2165919/cody-bellinger/fantasy/\">Cody Bellinger</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1940495/josh-bell/fantasy/\">Josh Bell</a>. Bell is no longer more than a late-round flier for Fantasy, and Casas has been pretty good when on the field, but has missed a bunch of time with injuries and hasn't really made an impact outside of the second half of the 2023 season, which leaves us with … Alonso and Bellinger as the true success stories for the position since 2017. You can throw Vladimir Guerrero in there (he came up as a third baseman) if you want to make things look better, but the reality is, there just haven't been a lot of hits among first base prospects lately. </p><p>And we're feeling it at the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> level. Those older stalwarts are still mostly holding it down, though there are warning signs for Harper, Olson, Devers, and Freeman that have knocked them down a peg or two. Kurtz is doing his part, but we need some reinforcements at the position before the bottom truly falls out.</p>\n<p>Is that help coming in 2026? Read on for my thoughts on the biggest breakouts from 2025, the biggest rankings risers, some rookies to know, and more. But, spoiler alert: I think it's more likely the position is in worse shape this time next year than the opposite. </p><h2> 2025 First Base Review </h2><ol><li>Pete Alonso, NYM: .272 - 87 - 38 - 126 - 1</li><li>Josh Naylor, SEA: .295 - 81 - 20 - 92 - 30</li><li>Cody Bellinger, NYY: .272 - 89 - 29 - 98 - 13</li><li>Rafael Devers, SF: .252 - 99 - 35 - 109 - 1</li><li>Nick Kurtz, ATH: .290 - 90 - 36 - 86 - 2</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044509/matt-olson/fantasy/\">Matt Olson</a>, ATL: .272 - 98 - 29 - 95 - 1</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2221784/vladimir-guerrero-jr/fantasy/\">Vladimir Guerrero Jr.</a>, TOR: .292 - 96 - 23 - 84 - 6</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1630079/freddie-freeman/fantasy/\">Freddie Freeman</a>, LAD: .295 - 81 - 24 - 90 - 6</li><li>Vinnie Pasquantino, KC: .264 - 72 - 32 - 113 - 1</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3117931/michael-busch/fantasy/\">Michael Busch</a>, CHC: .262 - 78 - 34 - 90 - 4</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2121030/yandy-diaz/fantasy/\">Yandy Diaz</a>, TB: .300 - 79 - 25 - 83 - 3</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/3166655/tyler-soderstrom/fantasy/\">Tyler Soderstrom</a>, ATH: .276 - 75 - 25 - 93 - 8</li></ol><p>Okay, we've gotta talk about Josh Naylor here. He became the slowest player in the Statcast era to steal 30 bases, and it wasn't particularly close – <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2507367/juan-soto/fantasy/\">Juan Soto</a> stole his 38 while ranking in the 13th percentile in sprint speed, while Naylor was in the <em>second </em>percentile. Before those two, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2184352/kyle-tucker/fantasy/\">Kyle Tucker</a> in 2023 was the slowest 30-steal guy, and he was in the 33rd percentile. Naylor was an incredibly opportunistic baserunner, especially after the trade to Seattle, as he stole 19 in 54 games – a near 60-steal pace. Of course, this was also a contract year, and steals have a tendency to spike in contract years – which makes sense, as attempting steals is one thing a player has a lot of control over to boost their perceived value on the market. Does that mean Naylor will go back to being a non-factor for steals if and when he lands with a new team this offseason? There's no guarantee, but if I set the over/under on steals in 2026 at 14.5 for Naylor, I probably wouldn't take the over. </p><p>It's not like there was some kind of position-wide speed rush happening, either. His 30 steals were more than double the next best first baseman, and played a big part in why he ranked so highly despite merely pretty good numbers otherwise. That's a good reason to fade Naylor in 2026. </p>\n<p>As for the rest of the position, it's pretty much what you expect at this point: Some really strong four-category production at the top end, and then either batting average or power specialists after that. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1765813/bryce-harper/fantasy/\">Bryce Harper</a> comes up just short of making this top 12, mostly due to injuries – though it is worth noting that he had a pretty unremarkable season by his standards, which is noteworthy as he approaches his mid-30s. </p><h3> \t<strong>Biggest Breakout from 2025</strong></h3><p>Nick Kurtz, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ATH/athletics/\">Athletics</a></p><p>Kurtz is either going to be one of the four or five best hitters for the next decade or there are going to be <em>a lot</em> of disappointed Fantasy analysts and players. He finished his rookie season with a 1.002 OPS, becoming just the sixth player in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> history with a 1.000 OPS in at least 450 plate appearances as a rookie. And there aren't a lot of flops on that list: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/223571/albert-pujols/fantasy/\">Albert Pujols</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2071264/aaron-judge/fantasy/\">Aaron Judge</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1103045/ryan-braun/fantasy/\">Ryan Braun</a>, Ted Williams, and … Bernie Carbo? Okay, yeah, there's one flop there, as Carbo would go on to have a .782 OPS over his next five seasons, with just one part-time season where he managed even a .900 OPS the rest of his career. </p><p>But even the guys who remained very good hitters mostly took a step back in their second season, too: </p>\n<ul><li>Judge: 1.049 OPS as a rookie; .919 OPS his next season</li><li>Pujols: 1.013 OPS as a rookie; .955 OPS his next season</li><li>Braun: 1.004 OPS as a rookie; .888 OPS his next season</li><li>Williams: 1.045 OPS as a rookie; 1.036 OPS his next season</li><li>Bernie Carbo: 1.004 OPS as a rookie; .677 OPS his next season</li></ul><p>All four of them took a step back, though obviously Williams' was marginal. And there's nothing wrong with <em>just</em> being a high-.800s/low-.900s OPS bat. But if Kurtz gets pushed into the first-round range in 2026 drafts (which seems likely at this point), it doesn't leave much margin for error. If he's <em>just</em> Matt Olson next season, that's still a great player. But it would make Kurtz a pretty big disappointment at that price. </p><p>And there is risk here. He has prodigious skills, but if his second-half strikeout rate improvement doesn't stick, there's obvious batting average risk here for a guy who had a 31% strikeout rate and .255 expected batting average overall. His home park will help, but Kurtz has legit swing-and-miss issues that could be exposed. He'll still hit for a bunch of power, but expecting Kurtz' rookie season top-line numbers to just represent his base-line moving forward might be a mistake. </p><h3> \t<strong>Biggest Bust from 2025</strong></h3><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2835063/jake-burger/fantasy/\">Jake Burger</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TEX/texas-rangers/\">Rangers</a></p><p>Burger was being drafted as a top-10 first baseman entering 2025. I was way out on him at that price, and it should serve as a cautionary tale moving forward. Burger is a very good power hitter, but that's <em>all</em> he does well. Unlike many other power hitters, Burger rarely draws a walk, and when you combine that with well below average defense (at either corner spot) and nonexistent baserunning value, and it left him with a very slim margin for error. On a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/MIA/miami-marlins/\">Marlins</a> team desperate for hitting, that never really cost him playing time, but it became an issue on a Rangers team with playoff aspirations <em>and</em> viable alternatives. When Burger is locked in, he's a very useful player in real life despite his limitations, but he's also streaky, and it's untenable to play him on a good team when things aren't going well. He very well may end up starting somewhere and put up another 30-homer season in 2026, but this is not a profile you should be chasing when it costs close to a top-100 pick. </p>\n<p>If you're looking for a player who could be in a similar spot in 2026, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/1960254/eugenio-suarez/fantasy/\">Eugenio Suarez</a> comes to mind (albeit at a different position). He'll walk more than Burger and figures to get a big enough contract this offseason that his team will feel obliged to play him even if things go sideways. But he's a similar one-dimensional slugger whose value really depends on being an outlier power hitter. </p><h3> \t<strong>Biggest rankings movers from 2025 to 2026</strong></h3><p><strong>Up:</strong> Nick Kurtz, Athletics; Tyler Soderstrom, Athletics; Spencer Torkelson, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/DET/detroit-tigers/\">Tigers</a></p><p>I thought I had Soderstrom pegged: He was an intriguing hitting prospect, but not one who would likely matter for Fantasy once he lost catcher eligibility. He definitely exceeded expectations in 2025, and with an xwOBA of .352 compared to his actual mark of .354, it seems sustainable. He fizzed out a bit after a hot start, slumping in May and June, but ended up with an .853 OPS in the second half. I always like to see how our breakouts adjust to the adjustments, and Soderstrom did what we wanted to see. </p>\n<p>Torkelson has a bit of that Jake Burger thing going on for him. He's a lot more willing to take a walk, but as we've seen in his career, his playing time is never assured when he goes into slumps. The power here is legit, but playing half his games in Detroit makes it an uphill climb at times, and he's someone I'm more comfortable with as a corner infielder when I need power specifically than someone I want to rely on as a cornerstone of my lineup. </p><p><strong>Down:</strong> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2044379/christian-walker/fantasy/\">Christian Walker</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/HOU/houston-astros/\">Astros</a>; Jake Burger, Rangers; Triston Casas, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BOS/boston-red-sox/\">Red Sox</a></p><p>Admit it: You didn't realize Walker nearly got to 30 homers and 90 RBI, did you? In fairness, Walker was basically unplayably terrible for the first three months of the season, entering July with a .223/.286/.366 line. But he more or less looked like himself for the final three months of the season, hitting 15 homers with an .800 OPS in the second half of the season. That's not enough to make Walker a viable starting first baseman again heading into his age-35 season, but I do think you need to make sure you don't forget about him for your corner infield spot for what should be some very cheap power. </p><p>As for Casas … I dunno. He was bad before he got hurt, but it was only 29 games. But he also hasn't been particularly good in his MLB career, certainly not since the second half breakout in 2023, at least. There is big power potential here, and a move away from Fenway Park (one of the toughest parks for left-handed power in the game) probably wouldn't be a bad thing for him. But at this point, you have to view him as just a late-round sleeper, I think. </p>\n<h2> Offseason preview </h2><h3> \t<strong>Who needs an upgrade most? </strong> </h3><ul><li>Red Sox</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYY/new-york-yankees/\">Yankees</a></li><li>Marlins</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/NYM/new-york-mets/\">Mets</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/WAS/washington-nationals/\">Nationals</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-pirates/\">Pirates</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CIN/cincinnati-reds/\">Reds</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SEA/seattle-mariners/\">Mariners</a></li><li>Rangers</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/ARI/arizona-diamondbacks/\">Diamondbacks</a></li></ul><p>That's not a small number. Some of those will be filled either by incumbents re-signing or possible prospect promotions, but some of these teams are likely just going to continue to have weak first base spots. For a team like the Marlins or Pirates who hope to take a step toward playoff contention this season, clearing the low bar of getting at least league-average production from the first base spot should be a big priority. We'll see if it is. </p><h3> \t<strong>Top impending free agents</strong> </h3><ul><li>Pete Alonso</li><li>Cody Bellinger*</li><li>Josh Naylor</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211176/rhys-hoskins/fantasy/\">Rhys Hoskins</a>**</li><li>Paul Goldschmidt</li><li>Josh Bell</li></ul><p>*$25 million player option with a $5 million buyout<br />**$18 million mutual option with a $4 million buyout</p><p>There are some moving pieces here, but Alonso has at least already announced he will be opting out and heading into free agency. You have to think the Mets are heavy favorites to re-sign him, and I don't expect it to take nearly as long to come to an agreement as it did last offseason. <br />Bellinger seems all but certain to opt out of the final year of his deal, though that hasn't been confirmed yet – but could be as soon as the Yankees season ends. He brings athleticism and defensive versatility few other first baseman can match, which should lead to a strong market for his services now that we have a few years of above-average production to go on. But leaving Yankee Stadium wouldn't exactly be a good thing for this lefty's production, so let's hope he returns.</p>\n<p>Naylor is the other big bat remaining, though I could see him dealing with a protracted negotiation as he tries to land what will likely be his one and only big free agent contract. He's a fine hitter, and an especially adept run-producer, but he's also limited to 1B and isn't likely to bring much value to the table beyond his bat, so it'll be a tough market. The rest of these guys seem likely to settle for one-year contracts as fill-ins for teams who don't want to take a zero at the position but also don't want to make a big investment. Hoskins still seems like he has some juice left, but you're still mostly just hoping for slightly above average production from him at this point. </p><h3> \t<strong>Trade candidates</strong> </h3><ul><li>Yandy Diaz, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/TB/tampa-bay-rays/\">Rays</a></li><li>Michael Busch, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/CHC/chicago-cubs/\">Cubs</a> </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/26635167/spencer-steer/fantasy/\">Spencer Steer</a>, Reds</li><li>Triston Casas, Red Sox</li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/2211203/ryan-mountcastle/fantasy/\">Ryan Mountcastle</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/BAL/baltimore-orioles/\">Orioles</a></li></ul><p>There's a lot of speculation here, obviously, but we can make some educated guesses. The Rays don't want to spend money. The Red Sox, Reds, Orioles, and Cubs have some log jams they could clear by moving on from \"good enough\" options at the cold corner. I'd say Busch is the least likely to be traded, but if the Cubs don't view <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28837122/moises-ballesteros/fantasy/\">Moises Ballesteros</a> as a long-term option behind the plate, they probably need to move him to first base at some point. Of course, he could also be traded if the team wants to upgrade their major-league roster without losing any 2025 contributors. </p><h3> \t<strong>Top 2026 rookies to know</strong> </h3><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29153551/bryce-eldridge/fantasy/\">Bryce Eldridge</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/SF/san-francisco-giants/\">Giants</a> </li><li>Tre' Morgan, Rays</li></ul><p>You could also add names like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920032/xavier-isaac/fantasy/\">Xavier Isaac</a> (Rays), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29426032/charlie-condon/fantasy/\">Charlie Condon</a> (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/teams/COL/colorado-rockies/\">Rockies</a>), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/28920021/cam-collier/fantasy/\">Cam Collier</a> (Reds), Jonathan Long (Cubs), <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29075764/ryan-clifford/fantasy/\">Ryan Clifford</a> (Mets), or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/players/29632924/josue-briceno/fantasy/\">Josue Briceno</a> (Tigers), all of whom are listed at other positions or don't quite crack global top-100 lists. But there aren't a ton of true first base prospects in the high part of most rankings lists to begin with, and outside of Eldridge, nobody seems poised to make an immediate impact right now. The offseason could change that, of course, but don't expect the savior at first base to come from the minors (at least not again, Nick Kurtz). </p>\n<p>I do want to pause and focus on Eldridge for a second, because he is someone you want to have on your radars. He got a cup of coffee at the end of the season for the Giants and predictably struggled – he was a 20-year-old just two years removed from being drafted who was playing through a wrist injury that ultimately required surgery to remove a bone spur after the end of the season. This is one of those situations where, if Eldridge had just spent the whole season toiling away in the minors (where he had 25 homers in 102 games and had a 120 wRC+ despite being one of the youngest players at both Double-A <em>and</em> Triple-A, he would enter 2026 with a ton of hype as he battled to make the roster in Spring Training. Instead he'll enter the spring as the presumed starter at first base coming off an MLB cameo where he struggled mightily, which should tamp down the hype. </p><p>But make no mistake: Eldridge is in the same tier of prospect Kurtz was before he made his debut and is still very much the kind of player you need to be excited about. Don't let his very brief struggles scare you off.</p>\n            </div>",

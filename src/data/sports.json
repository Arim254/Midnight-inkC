Things are already off to a hot start inside the squared circle with a shocking title change on SmackDown as Drew McIntyre overcame Cody Rhodes to win the undisputed WWE title through Three Stages of Hell, thanks to a little help from Jacob Fatu. But as the schedule starts to heat up, there are some important stops along the way to reaching The Showcase of the Immortals. It begins with the Royal Rumble on Jan. 31 from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where one man and one woman will punch their ticket to WrestleMania. Then attention shifts to the Elimination Chamber in Chicago on Feb. 28, where again one man and one woman will book a title match at WrestleMania, set for April 18 and 19 in Las Vegas for the second straight year.With all that in mind, the CBS Sports wrestling experts sat down to make five predictions about what we will see leading up to -- and at -- WrestleMania 42. Read on to see what we expect over the coming months.1. Who is going to win the Royal Rumble?Unanimous: Bron Breakker and Bianca BelairBreakker's rise came sooner than expected. WWE clearly sees him as a future main event player, but Seth Rollins' injury expedited his role in The Vision. Headlining Mania might be premature, but then again, WWE already features him prominently on Monday Night Raw. If WWE goes all-in on Breakker, winning the Rumble is the best way to elevate him. I'm going to throw a dart for the women's Rumble. Bianca Belair hasn't wrestled since putting on the match of the weekend against Rhea Ripley and IYO SKY at WrestleMania 41. A finger injury sidelined her longer than anyone expected. If she's secretly cleared, a Rumble return would be a great surprise, and a perfect set-up to challenge her former tag team partner, WWE women's champion Jade Cargill. -- Shakiel Mahjouri\nJey Uso winning last year's Rumble was great in that it was a genuine surprise. I don't think we get that level of drama this year. Personally, I'd prefer Bron Breakker not win the Rumble and earn a title shot at Elimination Chamber instead, but this feels like the year WWE gives Breakker a dominant Rumble and has him get the win. On the women's side, I agree with Shakiel that a Bianca Belair win would be the right move. Belair has been out of action long enough that her return will feel fresh. And we all know Belair can deliver in the WrestleMania spotlight. -- Brent Brookhouse2. Who is going to win the Elimination Chamber?Men's -- Roman Reigns (unanimous) | Women's -- Rhea Ripley or Liv MorganRoman Reigns has more WrestleMania main events than anyone. It's unlikely he'll be demoted this year. Breakker should win the Royal Rumble; it's the most prestigious path to Mania. \"The OTC\" doesn't need that boost. He'll find his path to a world title match through the brutal confines of the Elimination Chamber. Women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer needs a talented, high-profile Mania challenger. Ripley, after winning the Elimination Chamber, is a terrific foil for a match with high critical and commercial appeal. -- MahjouriI really wish I was saying anyone other than Roman Reigns here. WWE really needs to lean on guys who are closer to full-time to build the future. That said, WrestleMania is all about the \"big names\" and Reigns is a guy they can lean on for a main event match. Again, I'd love to be surprised by a different move, but I just don't see it. For the women's Elimination Chamber, Liv Morgan seems like a fair choice to get the win. Stephanie Vaquer needs a solid name challenger and Morgan fills the heel role and brings the credibility needed for a WrestleMania title match. -- Brookhouse\n3. What is one major WrestleMania match that isn't currently on the radar but will come together in the coming months?Unanimous: Gunther vs. Brock LesnarBrock Lesnar vs. Gunther screams special attraction. It's a modern dream match between two of WWE's stiffest strikers. It's a match that sells itself with minimal build required, a perfect way to utilize Lesnar's part-time status. It will be tremendously physical, and can further build Gunther's aura after he retired John Cena and Goldberg in 2025.4. What will be the four top title matches at WrestleMania 42?Undisputed WWE Championship -- Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Roman Reigns* World Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Bron BreakkerWWE Women's Championship -- Jade Cargill (c) vs. Bianca BelairWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Liv Morgan-- BrookhouseUndisputed WWE Championship -- Cody Rhodes or Jacob Fatu vs. Bron Breakker*World Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Roman ReignsWWE Women's Championship -- Jade Cargill (c) vs. Bianca BelairWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Rhea Ripley-- Mahjouri\n*denotes if Rhodes is able to win back the title from Drew McIntyre\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the second week in a row, the Los Angeles Rams will be hitting the road for a playoff game, and for the second week in a row, Los Angeles is favored to win. The Rams opened as a 4.5-point favorite over the Bears, which is notable because if the point spread holds, it would mark the first time in NFL history that a road playoff team has been favored by four points or more in two different games during the same postseason. During the wild card round, the Rams were favored by 10.5 points against the Panthers, making them the largest ROAD favorite in the Super Bowl era.The weather in Chicago is expected to be bitterly cold this week, which might explain why the point spread has moved toward the Bears over the past few days. As of Thursday, the Rams are favored by just 3.5 points, which might actually be a good thing, because road teams favored by four points have historically struggled in the playoffs. As a matter of fact, if the point spread moves back up to four points, the Rams would have to defy history if they wanted to cover the spread in this game. According to Pro Football Reference, there have only been 10 games over the past 50 years where a road team has been favored by four points or more in a playoff game, and it's been ugly for the favored team in that situation. \nHere's how the favorite did in each of those 10 games: They went 0-10 against the spread, including the Rams, who didn't cover against the PanthersThey went 4-6 straight-up, with the three wins coming by an average of four points per gameLet's take a look at all 10 games (via Pro Football Reference). Teams (Year)SpreadResultDid the road favorite cover?Steelers at Raiders (1976 AFC Championship)Steelers, -4Steelers lose 24-7NoRaiders at Broncos (1977 AFC Championship)Raiders, -4Raiders lose 20-17NoEagles at Buccaneers (1979 NFC divisional)Eagles, -4.5Eagles lose 24-17NoCardinals at Saints (2000 NFC wild card)Cardinals, -5.5Cardinals lose 31-28NoSaints at Seahawks (2010 NFC wild card)Saints, -10Saints lose 41-36NoSteelers at Broncos (2011 AFC wild card)Steelers, -7.5Steelers lose 29-23No49ers at Falcons (2012 NFC Championship)49ers, -4.549ers win 28-24NoSeahawks at Vikings (2015 NFC wild card)Seahawks, -4.5Seahawks win 10-9NoBuccaneers at Commanders (2020 NFC wild card)Buccaneers, -10Bucs win 31-23NoRams at Panthers (2025 NFC wild card)Rams, -10.5Rams win 34-31NoOf the four wins, one came from a 2015 Seahawks team that only won because Minnesota's Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal in the final seconds of a 10-9 Vikings' loss. Another win came from a 2012 49ers team that trailed 17-0 against the Falcons in the NFC title game before rallying to win. And let's not forget about the Rams, who needed a TD pass from Matthew Stafford with 38 seconds left to beat the underdog Panthers. Win or lose, all 10 games have been close and the favored team has NEVER covered a single time in five decades. Although the Rams are favored by just 3.5 points at DraftKings, the point spread is still four points in some markets, so it will be interesting to see where that closes. The weather will certainly be a factor on Sunday, with the temperature expected to be just under 20 degrees when the games kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC. Since Sean McVay was hired in 2017, the Rams have only played in three games where the kickoff temperature was 25 degrees or lower and they went 2-1 in those games. Week 6, 2018: Rams 23-20 over Broncos (Kickoff temperature: 25 degrees)Week 15, 2022: Packers 24-12 over Rams (Kickoff temperature: 15 degrees)Week 16, 2024: Rams 19-9 over Jets (Kickoff temperature: 23 degrees)Matthew Stafford was only the starting QB for one of these games and that was the win over the Jets, and he actually sounds excited about the idea of playing in cold weather. \"I love NFL football and the history of it, Lambeau Field and the ice bowl, those kinds of things,\" the Rams QB said Wednesday when asked if it's fun to play in cold weather. \"There's something to it. That feels right when football's outdoors, you're playing it late in the year, it's cold, it means a lot. I'm embracing it. I know our team is, too. I'm looking forward to the opportunity. I know it's going to be a great crowd there and it'll be a lot of fun.\"Stafford was on the field last year for a snowy playoff game against the Eagles, where the kickoff temperature was 34 degrees before dropping as the game went on. The Rams ended up losing that game, 28-22, but it was the Eagles' closest win during their run to winning Super Bowl LIX. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The World Baseball Classic is set for this coming spring and the event has been growing in popularity among fans and players alike. The USA roster this time around is as loaded as it has ever been. To wit, the rotation right now is fronted by both 2025 Cy Young winners with plenty of All-Stars behind them. It's Tarik Skubal, Paul Skenes, Logan Webb, Joe Ryan and, if a fifth starter is even needed, Matthew Boyd and Nolan McLean. Don't worry about the back-end of the bullpen because Mason Miller and David Bednar are on board. The roster isn't yet complete, but there's a loaded lineup in the process of being built. Both Cal Raleigh and Will Smith are lined up as the catching duo. Bryce Harper, Brice Turang, Gunnar Henderson and Bobby Witt Jr. were already rostered before a good third baseman came aboard, but then Alex Bregman joined the fray. Kyle Schwarber is on board for the DH spot and Byron Buxton recently joined an outfield that already included Aaron Judge, Corbin Carroll and Pete Crow-Armstrong.Using only the players on board so far, here's what a Team USA lineup might look like: 1. Bobby Witt Jr., SS2. Aaron Judge, RF3. Cal Raleigh, C4. Kyle Schwarber, DH5. Bryce Harper, 1B6. Gunnar Henderson, 2B7. Alex Bregman, 3B8. Corbin Carroll, LF9. Pete Crow-Armstrong, CF\nNow, there's a lot to sort out here and so many different routes that could be taken. I like stacking the power toward the top of the order and then having the base-stealers all at the bottom, so every time through the order after the first, you're looking at Carroll and PCA as table-setter types for the thunder. Buxton could also start in center and we could throw him ahead of Carroll in the lineup. The bench then would have two amazing players with speed and defense in PCA and Turang for the late innings. I moved Henderson to second base to maximize how ridiculous that lineup could look, but surely Turang will get plenty of starts at second and Henderson could split time at short with Witt. In fact, since Henderson swings lefty and Witt is right-handed, they could platoon. Speaking of which, Pete Alonso, among others, has expressed interest in playing and could platoon with Harper at first base. And it should be noted that PCA is left-handed while Buxton is a righty, so, again, there could be a platoon in the outfield as well. Keep in mind that it's unlikely USA would want to catch Raleigh every game. He's a switch-hitter while Smith hits right-handed, so they could, again, platoon. It's funny to think about platooning all these All-Stars, but with this group it's reasonable and a good illustration of how loaded this squad is. There's defensive versatility in the outfield and infield as well, too. \nWhatever route is taken here and whoever else joins the team, USA manager Mark DeRosa has an embarrassment of riches.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants made a massive move late Wednesday night, as they're now working to finalize an agreement with former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh to be their next head coach, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirmed. Harbaugh was immediately the most sought-after name on the market once he and the Ravens parted ways, and the Giants struck quickly to work on a deal with Harbaugh before he could take reported meetings with the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons this weekend. From the Giants' perspective, this has to be considered an excellent hire -- an \"A,\" if you will.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHarbaugh was extremely successful with the Ravens, compiling a 180-113 regular-season record and making the playoffs 12 times in 18 seasons, going 13-11 in the postseason and winning a Super Bowl back in 2012. A CEO-style head coach who was a former special-teams coordinator, Harbaugh was nevertheless at the forefront of leaguewide trends like aggressive fourth-down decision-making and he showed the ability to adapt with the times and with the construction of his roster, repeatedly seeking out new ideas on both sides of the ball so that he could mold the system around his players rather than try to fit square pegs into round holes. \nHe'll bring immediate stability and competence to a Giants organization that has been desperate for it over at least the last decade, as it has cycled through coach after coach and disappointment after disappointment. He should also be able to bring with him a strong coaching staff, given the connections he has made over the years and the various coaches who have worked with him at one time or another. Reports have already circulated that he'll bring Todd Monken to New York as his offensive coordinator, which would be a very good hire as the Giants look to build their future around Jaxson Dart. Lamar Jackson was already a superstar before Monken got to Baltimore, but he certainly helped take Jackson's game to another level. If he can do the same for Dart, that would be extremely beneficial as the Giants look to improve after being one of the worst teams in the league. We don't yet know who Harbaugh would like to bring with him on the defensive side of the ball, but he's repeatedly found top defensive minds over the years. He's had coaches like Rex Ryan, Vic Fangio, Chuck Pagano, Dean Pees, Teryl Austin, Wink Martindale, Steve Spagnuolo, Mike Macdonald, Leslie Frazier, Jesse Minter, Zach Orr, Anthony Weaver and Dennard Wilson work under him as either coordinators or position coaches at one time or another over the last decade-plus, and the Ravens have routinely had one of the NFL's better defenses. A great deal of that obviously has to do with the talent they have been able to land on that side of the ball, thanks to an excellent front office, but Harbaugh has also brought in a bunch of strong defensive coaches, as mentioned.\nHarbaugh's age (he'll turn 64 early next season) and the Ravens' recent propensity for blowing leads are slight concerns here, but they're mitigated by his long track record of success and the Giants' desperate need for someone who can professionalize the organization. You can, of course, find that type of coach anywhere if you turn over the right stones, but the Giants obviously valued Harbaugh's pedigree highly, and they moved quickly to strike on the man many viewed as the top candidate available this cycle.What others are sayingCBS Sports senior NFL writer Pete Prisco was even more effusive in his praise of the Harbaugh hiring.\"For him, it's an 'A',\" Prisco said. \"It's the best job out there. And I said that when all the jobs opened up. And people say, 'What are you saying?' Well, it's the Giants. The New York Giants. You're in New York. \n\"And not only that, you have a lot of young talent on that team to build around. If you look at the NFL, what do you want? You want a quarterback and you want pass rushers. Well, they have it. If you believe in Jaxson Dart -- and I think he can be successful -- then you have the quarterback and the pass rushers, so it makes sense from that standpoint. So, from his standpoint, it's an A. \"From the Giants' standpoint, A+. You targeted him, you went and got him, and now it's all on you to make sure it works around him. I think this is a no-brainer hire for both sides. If I were John Harbaugh, that's the job I would want. If I were the New York Giants, John Harbaugh's the guy I would want.\"CBS Sports HQ NFL analyst Danny Kanell echoed many of those sentiments. \"I will give it an 'A+',\" Kanell said. \"This was the only coach that would come in and have us talking about this Giants organization as potentially a playoff team. And I don't think it'll only be me. With the young nucleus of talent that the Giants have on this roster, with the track record of success in building a winning culture, with the coordinator that he's most likely going to bring in with him, I think this is a home run hire for the Giants.\"\nYou're not going to find very many people out there who don't think this hiring is one of the better hirings of the cycle, no matter who lands the other available jobs. Harbaugh was sought after for a reason, and the Giants were able to land him before anyone else had a chance. Even if it doesn't work out, the process that led here was likely solid, even if it seemed somewhat predetermined that the Giants would zero in on Harbaugh if he ever became available.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots and Houston Texans both used stifling defensive efforts to carry the day in their Wild Card Weekend playoff victories. Something has to give when the No. 2-seeded Patriots host the No. 5-seeded Texans on Sunday in the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs. Kickoff from Gillette Stadium is set for 3 p.m. ET in the nationally-televised contest.  The AFC East champion Patriots are coming off a dominant 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers in which they sacked Justin Herbert six times and allowed 207 yards of total offense while holding Los Angeles to 1-of-10 on third-down attempts. The Texans used a similar profile as their rugged defense broke open a tight game in the second half for a 30-6 victory over the homestanding Pittsburgh Steelers. Houston allowed just 175 yards of total offense and 3.1 yards per play, and two late defensive scores helped overcome a three-turnover performance from quarterback C.J. Stroud. New England is a three-point favorite at home and the over/under for total points scored is 40.5, per the latest DraftKings NFL odds for Texans vs. Patriots. Here is a look at the Texans vs. Patriots matchup from a betting perspective: Texans vs. Patriots oddsOpening spread: Patriots -3Opening money line: Patriots -175, Texans +145 Opening total: 41, now 40.5  Texans betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 12-5ATS record:10-7O/U record: 7-10The Texans quietly overcame an 0-3 start -- by 13 combined points -- to end the regular season on a nine-game winning streak behind one of the NFL's top-rated defenses. A national TV audience on Monday night saw what that menacing group, with a relentless pass rush and ball-hawking secondary, is capable of. However, they were fortunate that Pittsburgh is an extremely limited offensive team because Stroud's consistent troubles with the snap (he had five total fumbles) and shaky decision-making kept the Steelers in the game for three quarters and could have spelled doom against a higher-quality opponent such as the one they will face Sunday in the Patriots. Patriots betting profile\nOpening win total: 8.5 wins  W/L record: 14-3ATS record: 11-6O/U record: 9-8 The Patriots were a trendy pick to exceed their over/under win total and perhaps contend for a playoff berth, and they cleared both hurdles with room to spare. There's little doubt they were aided by the NFL's weakest schedule but, even so, a road win over the Bills and their wild-card victory over the Chargers illustrated that this team is no fluke. Second-year quarterback Drake Maye, who is an MVP candidate, didn't have his best game in the opening round but still outplayed Herbert, who has yet to notch a playoff victory. Maye sealed the game with late TD pass to Hunter Henry. Maye threw for 268 yards and added a team-best 66 rushing yards as the Patriots moved one win away from an AFC title game appearance in their first year under coach Mike Vrabel. Texans-Patriots prop pick: C.J. Stroud Over 0.5 interceptions\nAlthough we believe the Houston defense is strong enough to carry the Texans to a Super Bowl appearance, the alarmingly poor play of Stroud in the opening round is a concern that can't be ignored. All the Texans need from the former No. 2 overall pick is a game manager-plus profile, one that includes playing mistake-free football with the occasional big play mixed in, and Stroud has shown such ability in the past. But he looked uncomfortable from the start against the Steelers and appeared unwilling to use his legs to get a first down when the opportunity presented itself. This dynamic caused his awful red-zone interception. Stroud's lack of accountability also was concerning as afterward he repeatedly told a stunned media contingent -- many of whom believed he was trolling -- that he thought he played well in the victory. While a similar performance will guarantee a Houston exit, we're hoping for better from the third-year QB who, in fairness, has led the Texans to the Divisional Round in all three seasons as their starter. But we expect the Patriots' varied looks to force Stroud into at least one mistake and feel comfortable that he will cash the Over on this interception prop.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        ATLANTA -- Everywhere you turned, they were there. In your hotel lobby. Walking the streets of Atlanta. In your favorite restaurant or bar. Inside Gibney's Pub the night before the Peach Bowl, it was a full crimson takeover. Decked in their favorite red gear, Indiana fans packed into the popular pub to watch the Fiesta Bowl between Ole Miss and Miami. There wasn't an Oregon fan in sight. They loudly cheered for Ole Miss, letting out their famous \"Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoosiers!\" chant any time the Rebels did anything successful on the field. And even though Ole Miss lost, there was a joyousness with this rabid Indiana fanbase that has sometimes been missing in recent playoff games, especially ones featuring traditional powerhouses. That was just a preview of what was to come the following night inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Indiana fans outnumbered Oregon fans at least 4-to-1 in what turned out to be a 56-22 blowout win to send the Hoosiers to the College Football Playoff national championship game. After it was over, Indiana coach Curt Cignetti loudly crowed, \"There's nothing like having a home semifinal game.\" \n\n        \n            \n                Indiana flirting with all-time great status as Hoosiers plow through Oregon, into CFP National Championship\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEven Indiana wasn't entirely sure what to expect in the lead-up to the game. Their ravenous fanbase had taken over the Rose Bowl already, but there were some initial concerns that Oregon could travel well. Indiana even practiced a silent count in case the opposing fans got loud in Atlanta, according to left tackle Carter Smith, which Indiana had had to do against Oregon the first time around in a 30-20 win. As Cignetti pointed out after the game, Indiana had seven pre-snap penalties in that game trying to deal with the noise. There was no leaving that up to chance with a national title game appearance on the line. As crimson flooded into the Benz, creating what might have been a 90/10 split against Oregon fans, any need for a silent count went out the window. \"Not having to go on silent count because of Hoosier Nation being here and making them go on silent count is a huge aspect of the game and offensive operation that's not talked about enough,\" Indiana star quarterback Fernando Mendoza said. \"Shout out to Hoosier Nation because going on silent count, especially against the Ducks, is always tough and making the other team go on silent count might have counted for some points.\"\nSaid Smith: \"I love Hoosier Nation. They rally for us so well, they travel for us so well.\"The noise certainly seemed to impact Oregon quarterback Dante Moore. He threw a pick-six on Oregon's first play, and it didn't improve much from there. It was deafening inside the stadium when D'Angelo Ponds returned that interception to give Indiana a 7-0 lead just 11 seconds into the game. Moore had three turnovers in total, seemingly overwhelmed by Indiana's swarming defense and its loud fans. \n        \n            \n                Inside the pick-six play that kickstarted Indiana's destruction of Oregon in CFP semifinals\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe questions on the minds of many: How exactly is Indiana doing this?If you weren't aware before, you certainly are now that Indiana claims the largest living alumni base (more than 800,000 worldwide). There are Indiana fans all over the country, but many lay dormant like sleeper cells as the Hoosiers' football program wallowed in losing and irrelevancy for decades. They needed a call to action, a reason to believe a financial investment in IU football was worth it.\nEnter Cignetti and his famous \"I win. Google me\" confidence that almost immediately changed fan attitudes. The tremendous winning that followed prompted more investment, financially and emotionally, from a fanbase that traditionally cared more about basketball. It all coalesced around this special 2025 Indiana team that featured Cignetti, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza and a defense that has frustrated every opponent to date. It was like after every Indiana win, it activated another part of the fanbase that never believed this kind of run was possible for the Hoosiers. \"To watch this many people getting excited about Indiana football is truly a surprise,\" said Galen Clavio, who hosts the CrimsonCast podcast, \"but I think it's because of how unique this story is. What Curt Cignetti and his staff and the players have done in creating not just a great story with all these unique features but being such a dominant team has galvanized the fanbase into almost Beatlemania.\"A sign of the changing times: The most packed Assembly Hall will be this year -- so far, at least -- will be for a title game watch party on Monday. Tickets for the event were all gone within two hours of being available. \nSquint hard enough and you'll spot some Oregon green among the swath of Indiana crimson.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Clavio, who also works as the director of IU's National Sports Journalism Center, made the trips to the Rose Bowl and Peach Bowl, and plans on being in Miami for the national championship. The Indiana alumnus says he's been to every Indiana bowl game over the last 20 years except one, and there's been strong fan turnouts along the way. But nothing quite like this, where IU fans have overwhelmed Alabama and Oregon fans on college football's biggest stage. It hasn't been cheap for Indiana fans to do so. If you've made the trips to the Big Ten championship, Rose Bowl and Peach Bowl you've already spent thousands of dollars on airfare, lodging and tickets. It'll be even more expensive to get into Hard Rock Stadium on Monday with the cheapest tickets available selling on third-party resellers like StubHub for nearly $2,700. But there's a newness to it all that feels special for Indiana fans. After all, this was the losingest team in FBS history before Cignetti took it over. The program had not won a bowl game since 1991 when Bill Mallory's Hoosiers beat Baylor in the Copper Bowl. \n\"We're hungry and we like being the underdog,\" alumnus and billionaire booster Mark Cuban told CBS Sports at the Peach Bowl. \"We haven't experienced this before, so I think everybody wanted to come out and see what it was like. Now they know. We've got one more.\"\nAs someone remarked to Clavio, \"We've been saving up for football trips for 30 years and didn't realize it.\"\"People are making the decision to do it because of the opportunity to potentially be a part of something truly historic,\" Clavio said. \"I think that's what this team has done. It's created an environment where people feel like this is historic. This is something that I will remember for the rest of my life.\n\"That's the thing about Indiana people, maybe even more so than people from other schools. There's such an affinity for the university, there's such an affinity for the sports programs that are here that people want to feel like they're a part of it.\"Miami will be the ultimate litmus test for an Indiana fanbase that has conquered its opponent everywhere it goes. The Hoosiers have a massive alumni advantage over private school Miami, but the home game makes it easy for Hurricanes' fans to spend up on tickets without having to worry about airfare and hotel costs. That the game features a homegrown Miami coach in Mario Cristobal and a Miami native Heisman winner in Mendoza just adds to the interest. Count out this Indiana fanbase at your own peril, however. Said Clario, \"I wouldn't be shocked if Indiana had as many, if not more, in the stands.\" \nIndiana fans are everywhere, and the crimson wave is coming to overtake Miami next. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL playoffs are in full swing, but while most of the attention is on the teams chasing a Lombardi Trophy, a large chunk of the league has already turned its focus to the offseason.The biggest domino to fall so far was the Giants finalizing a deal with John Harbaugh to become their next head coach, but plenty of intrigue remains across the rest of the hiring cycle.With eight head-coaching jobs -- 25% of the league -- still open, let's play matchmaker. Below, we pair each vacant position with one of the top candidates on the market and examine why the fit makes sense.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona Cardinals: Robert SalehPrevious position: 49ers defensive coordinatorSaleh is likely to be picky about his next job after his failed tenure with the New York Jets. One reason that first stint did not work out was New York's inability to identify a viable franchise quarterback. \nArizona is in a similar spot, as the Cardinals are widely expected to move on from Kyler Murray this offseason, but they hold the No. 3 overall pick in the NFL Draft, giving them a clear path to address the position. If and when Saleh and the Cardinals solve the quarterback issue, they would have intriguing weapons -- namely Trey McBride and Marvin Harrison Jr. -- to build around.While the quarterback situation matters, Saleh -- who has reportedly been requested to interview for the job -- would also be an attractive hire to fix what was a disastrous Arizona defense in 2025. The Cardinals allowed 28.7 points per game and 358.9 total yards per game, both of which ranked in the bottom 10 in the NFL. Even during his lean years in New York, Saleh was able to elevate the defense, and he has done a masterful job keeping an injury-riddled 49ers unit humming into the divisional round.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons: Mike McDanielPrevious position: Dolphins head coachThe Falcons are an intriguing destination this cycle. On one hand, they have a boatload of talent on both sides of the ball, headlined by superstar running back Bijan Robinson. However, whoever takes this job also needs to be confident they can get Michael Penix Jr. -- who has endured an up-and-down start to his career -- back on track. Penix is coming off a season-ending ACL injury, but team owner Arthur Blank said in his end-of-season news conference that he expects the former first-round quarterback to return to full strength.Mike McDaniel seems like a logical fit for a couple of reasons. First, he has experience getting the best out of a young quarterback, as he revitalized Tua Tagovailoa early in his tenure in Miami. There is reason to believe he could do the same with Penix, especially with a strong supporting cast already in place. \nSecond, there is familiarity between McDaniel and the organization thanks to the arrival of Matt Ryan as the franchise's president of football. McDaniel was an offensive assistant with the Falcons from 2015-16 under offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, overlapping with Ryan's tenure as quarterback, including his MVP season in 2016.\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these nine jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens: Kliff KingsburyPrevious position: Commanders offensive coordinator It's not hard to figure out which of the eight teams with a coaching vacancy is the cream of the crop. It's the Ravens, and it's not particularly close because of two-time NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. No other franchise searching for a head coach can offer that level of elite play and stability at quarterback, so Baltimore should have its pick of the litter. Kingsbury is widely viewed as one of the top candidates on the market this cycle, and he appears to be an ideal fit for Jackson and the rest of the Ravens offense.\nHe has previous head-coaching experience after leading the Cardinals from 2019 to 2022, and he most recently worked with Jayden Daniels as Washington's offensive coordinator. Daniels has a similar skill set to Jackson, and Kingsbury had him operating at a high level during his rookie season, which helped the Commanders reach the NFC Championship Game. If he can tune Baltimore's offense in a similar way around Jackson, the Ravens could be back among the league's top contenders in short order.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns: Jim SchwartzPrevious position: Browns defensive coordinator It's rare to see a team fire its head coach and then simply elevate one of his coordinators, as most organizations prefer to clean house. However, Schwartz could be an exception. \nCleveland's defense was one of the few bright spots of the 2025 season, and from the outside looking in, Schwartz appeared to have strong buy-in from his players on that side of the ball. If he commands that level of respect inside the locker room, the transition would be seamless.He also has previous head-coaching experience, having led the Detroit Lions from 2009-13. If he wants another opportunity, this would be an intriguing setup, though much will hinge on what kind of offensive coordinator he brings aboard.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders: Klint KubiakPrevious position: Seahawks offensive coordinator The Raiders are an intriguing organization this cycle. The Pete Carroll era crashed and burned, but there is hope for a brighter future. That is because a trying 2025 season resulted in Las Vegas landing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, putting the franchise in position to select Heisman Trophy–winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza. \nIf Mendoza lives up to the hype, the Raiders would suddenly have a promising young core that includes the Indiana quarterback, along with running back Ashton Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers. Pair that with roughly $98 million in projected cap space -- the third most in the NFL -- and this rebuild could be jump-started quickly. That should make Las Vegas an attractive destination for someone like Kubiak, who is among the most sought-after candidates.Over the past two years, Kubiak has built a reputation for elevating offenses. In New Orleans, he had the Saints punching above their weight in 2024. This season, as the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, Kubiak helped lead the team to the No. 1 seed in the conference with a dynamic offense. If he can get Sam Darnold to throw for more than 4,000 yards and run a unit that averages 5.9 yards per play -- tied for the third-highest in the NFL -- there's no telling what he could do with Mendoza if the rookie lives up to his billing as the top pick.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins: Jesse MinterPrevious position: Chargers defensive coordinatorWith John Harbaugh landing with the Giants, where does Miami turn next? Well, how about Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter?\nTeam owner Stephen Ross has deep ties to the University of Michigan as one of its top donors and has a relationship with Jim Harbaugh, under whom Minter is currently coaching with the Chargers. Minter served as Harbaugh's defensive coordinator at Michigan from 2022-23, including during the program's College Football Playoff national championship run in 2023, so Ross is well aware of him. This pairing also aligns better from a timeline perspective. Minter, 42, is young enough to help lead a rebuild, and Miami's defense played well down the stretch in 2025, giving him something to build on heading into 2026.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Steelers: Brian FloresPrevious position: Vikings defensive coordinatorFlores would be a familiar face for the Steelers. The current Vikings DC worked under now former head coach Mike Tomlin in 2022 as a senior defensive assistant and linebackers coach after his tenure as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins ended in 2021. After that quick one-year stint in Pittsburgh, Flores moved on to Minnesota and has bolstered his reputation back up as one of the top defensive minds in the league, which feels like an ideal fit stylistically with the Steelers' identity.  \nThe big question for Flores as he looks for his second chance as an NFL head coach will be what Pittsburgh's plans are at quarterback. Aaron Rodgers has alluded to this being his final season, so they'll need an answer at the most important position in the sport. If he gets a clear enough answer there, working with former Defensive Player of the Year T.J. Watt could be extremely appealing to him. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee Titans: Kevin StefanskiPrevious position: Browns head coachStefanski is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year, and while his run in Cleveland ended, many of his issues there stemmed from the organization never solving the quarterback position. That would not be a problem in Tennessee, where the Titans have Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, under center. Ward flashed late in the season, and if Stefanski likes what he sees from the young quarterback, the Titans have a lot of potential.\nThe hardest part of a rebuild -- finding a quarterback -- is already in place, and the franchise is entering the offseason with roughly $102 million in cap space, the second most in the NFL, along with the No. 4 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. If the Titans can add the right pieces, they could become frisky sooner rather than later, depending on how quickly Stefanski can accelerate Ward's development.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season is arguably the most parity-filled year in league history.Five of the league's initial 14 playoff teams reached the postseason after losing 11 or more games the year prior, the most such playoff teams in NFL history. Four of the league's division winners won five or fewer games last season, also the most in NFL history.That parity produced one of -- if not the most -- unpredictable postseasons in NFL history, and we're only through one round. The 12 fourth-quarter lead changes in the wild card round stand as the most in a single postseason in NFL history. The four game-winning touchdowns in the final three minutes are the most in a single postseason in league history, and the four comeback wins in the final three minutes of the fourth quarter already rank as the most in a single postseason in NFL history.Given the high level of variance, any of the eight remaining teams in the divisional round likely feel they could make a run to the Super Bowl. However, all eight have major questions they must answer to complete a dream season. Here's a look at what each of the NFL's elite eight must overcome to hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy at the conclusion of Super Bowl LX.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Can their run defense hold up? This season is shaping up to be 2024 NFL MVP quarterback Josh Allen's best shot yet to take home the elusive Vince Lombardi Trophy. His eight career playoff wins are the most by a quarterback without a Super Bowl start, and the Bills' path is beginning to clear. \nAllen's Bills will face Bo Nix's Broncos in the divisional round, a squad Buffalo smoked 31-7 in the wild card round last season. After that, they could face the Patriots, a team they split the season series, or the Texans, a team that, like the Broncos, has a ferocious defense but an inconsistent offense.The major question for the Bills going forward is simple: Can their run defense hold up? When teams face Buffalo, they aim to limit the time Allen spends on the field. That's doable, given the Bills have the NFL's fifth-worst run defense (136.2 rushing yards allowed per game) and the league's third-worst rushing efficiency defense (5.1 yards per carry allowed).Time of possession wasn't an issue for the Bills in the regular season, as they led the NFL with an average of 33:08. That's thanks to having 2025 NFL rushing champion James Cook (1,621 yards) at running back and the league's leading quarterback rusher in Allen (579 rushing yards).\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Can their offense pick up the slack, especially in the red zone? The Texans' defense is a world destroyer. During the 2025 regular season, it ranked as the NFL's No. 1 total defense, allowing just 277.2 yards per game while surrendering the second-fewest points per game (17.4). Houston threw Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers' offense in a locker Monday in a 30-6 victory: The Texans became the second team in NFL playoff history to record multiple defensive touchdowns while allowing no touchdowns in a playoff game. They joined the 1940 Chicago Bears, who accomplished the feat in a 73-0 NFL Championship win over Washington.However, against stiffer competition, that defense's work could be undone by the offense. Quarterback C.J. Stroud fumbled five times Monday, tied for the most in a game in NFL playoff history. He recovered three, lost two and also threw an interception in Houston's win. \nThe Texans were notably inefficient in the red zone, producing the third-lowest touchdown rate in the league at 46.3%. Only the New York Jets (44.7%) and the New Orleans Saints (44.4%) were worse at converting opportunities inside the 20-yard line. Settling for field goals instead of touchdowns in the red area could doom the Texans, wasting their defense's efforts.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Can their OL hold up against the NFL's best defenses to protect Drake Maye?Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is having a phenomenal second season. He is the first player to lead the NFL in completion percentage (72%), yards per pass attempt (8.9) and passer rating (113.5) since Tony Romo in 2014. He also led the league in expected points added (EPA) per dropback (0.28).However, his individual brilliance could be undone by the offensive line. New England allowed the ninth-highest quarterback pressure rate (37.7%) and the ninth-most sacks in the NFL (48) during the regular season. Maye was also sacked five times in the Patriots' 16-3 wild card win over the Chargers.\nBoth the Broncos (68 sacks, most in the NFL) and the Texans (47 sacks, tied for seventh most) rank among the NFL's top 10 pass-rushing units, which could spell danger for Maye and the Patriots.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Can their defense overcome the worst remaining quarterback in the playoffs, Bo Nix?Bo Nix is a unique quarterback. He is the only player this season with more than 3,900 passing yards (3,931, eighth most in the NFL) and a yards-per-attempt average under 6.5 (6.4, 28th out of 33 qualified quarterbacks). Nix's inconsistency is why the Broncos, which have one of the five best defenses in football, prevailed by just one score (20-13) against the Chiefs' third-string quarterback, Chris Oladokun, on Christmas in Week 17 and slogged through a 19-3 Week 18 home win over the Chargers' backups to clinch the AFC's top seed.\nPasser rating isn't necessarily the end-all, be-all metric for evaluating quarterback play, but it isn't ideal that Nix's 87.8 passer rating ranks as the eighth lowest in the NFL this season and is the lowest among the eight remaining playoff quarterbacks.Three of the top four teams with the most punts in the 2025 regular season -- the Browns (93), Titans (78) and Raiders (74) --  fired their respective head coaches after missing the playoffs. The fourth team is Nix's Broncos, with 75 punts. He benefits from a stout offensive line and a defense with the league's best pass rush and 2024 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Pat Surtain II at cornerback.If there's a reason Denver doesn't emerge as the AFC champion despite having the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage, it will likely be because Nix doesn't play at a level close enough to that of his domineering defense.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoffs power rankings: Seahawks top eight remaining teams still vying for a Super Bowl title\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Can they continue to overcome their high volume of injuries?It's a minor miracle the 49ers are still alive entering the divisional round of the postseason. The 49ers have the most player games missed because of injuries among playoff teams this season, including the playoffs. On a related note, they also have the most games missed because of injury by Week 1 starters -- their key players -- among playoff teams this season.All-Pro edge rusher Nick Bosa, All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner and now All-Pro tight end George Kittle will not be available to San Francisco in the divisional round at the No. 1-seeded Seahawks while playing on a short week Saturday night. Head coach Kyle Shanahan is one of the NFL's most innovative coaches, but there comes a point when the missing talent on the field supersedes high-level Xs and Os.Notable 49ers injuries this seasonInjuryGames missedNick BosaTorn ACL14Fred WarnerBroken ankle11Brock PurdyTurf toe8Ricky PearsallKnee/ankle8Mykel WilliamsTorn ACL8George KittleAchilles/hamstring6Jauan JenningsBroken ribs2Trent WilliamsHamstring1\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Will their lackluster special teams come back to haunt them?The Rams have the look of a true Super Bowl contender with the NFL's No. 1 scoring offense (30.5 points per game) and the NFL's No. 10 scoring defense (20.4 points per game allowed). However, the third phase of the game -- special teams -- could get them in trouble in a close game.The Rams have the second-worst special teams expected points added (-50) this season, ahead of only the 6-11 Saints (-59.89), thanks to allowing two special teams touchdowns, tied for the third most in the NFL. Only the Browns and the Raiders allowed more, with three each in 2025.That's one of the reasons Los Angeles has a 4-5 record in one-score games this season. Head coach Sean McVay fired special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn after a 58-yard punt return touchdown by Rashid Shaheed helped the Seahawks rally from 16 points down in the fourth quarter to steal a 38-37 victory. That game helped the Seahawks win the NFC West and the NFC's No. 1 seed over the Rams.If Los Angeles doesn't tighten up on special teams, it could come up short of Super Bowl glory.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Can their defense make enough plays if they're not generating turnovers? The Bears defense led the NFL with 33 takeaways in 2025. However, if an opponent plays a clean game against it, things could get dicey. Chicago allowed the 10th-most points per game (24.4) and the fourth-most yards per game (361.8) this season.The Packers didn't turn the ball over against the Bears in the wild card round, which allowed them to race out to a 21-3 lead. The Bears were able to complete an 18-point comeback, the largest in franchise playoff history, in a 31-27 victory because the defense forced Green Bay into four consecutive punts, and Packers kicker Brandon McManus left seven points on the field with two missed field goals and a missed extra point.With that porous of a defense, the Bears walk somewhat of a tightrope on a weekly basis. Chicago will need to play a sound level of defense that it has produced only in spurts this season if it wishes to advance past the Rams and 2025 first-team All-Pro quarterback Matthew Stafford in the divisional round.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Can Sam Darnold avoid the big mistakes? Sam Darnold quarterbacked the Seahawks to an NFC West title and the NFC's No. 1 seed, but his play is declining entering the playoffs. He has eight total touchdowns and 10 turnovers since Week 11. His NFL-leading 20 turnovers (14 interceptions and six fumbles lost) in 2025 indicate a player prone to making a back-breaking error at any moment.Just last year, Darnold also helped the Vikings to a 14-win regular season before collapsing with an NFL playoff-record nine sacks in his postseason debut. The Vikings lost 27-9 in the wild card round to the Rams as a result.His 8.5 yards per pass attempt (second-best in the NFL) and passer rating (99.1, 11th-best in the NFL) are solid, but there's always a legitimate chance he could revert to the Jets' \"seeing ghosts\" version of himself, as he did in last year's playoffs.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The National Baseball Hall of Fame's 2026 induction class will be announced next Tuesday, Jan. 20, and for the second time I had the privilege to vote as a member of the Baseball Writers Association of America. I started an old Blogspot blog about baseball as a hobby way back in 2006 because I was bored one day. That's really all there was to it. That eventually led me to CBS Sports in 2013 and the BBWAA in 2015. After the requisite 10-year waiting period, I became a Hall of Fame voter last year.     Over time, I've become a \"big Hall\" guy, and I'm big on comparing players to their contemporaries and within the context of the era in which they played, not the entirety of baseball history. That doesn't mean the best players of the generation automatically get my vote, just that I prefer to look through that lens, especially with pitchers. Their roles and their usage has changed so much over the years. I think Hall of Fame standards should adjust as well.      I treat postseason performance as something that can elevate a player's Hall of Fame case, though I won't ding someone for a poor showing in October. The postseason is often a tiny number of games and a small fraction of the player's entire career. As for performance-enhancing drugs, I will explain my feeling below. Here now is my 2026 Hall of Fame ballot:     Unlike last year, when the great Ichiro Suzuki was Hall of Fame eligible for the first time, I didn't consider anyone on this year's ballot a slam dunk, no-doubt-about-it Hall of Famer. Everyone on this year's ballot required some level of deliberation. Cole Hamels, Félix Hernández, and Andruw Jones are the new additions to my ballot. They stepped into the spots that went to Ichiro, CC Sabathia, and Billy Wagner last year. The other seven players I voted for this year also got my vote last year.\nAccountability and transparency are of paramount importance in this  business. If you won't explain yourself, how can you expect the players  and people you write about to do the same? How could you expect readers  to take you seriously? To that end, here is why I filled out my Hall of  Fame ballot the way I did. The players are listed in no particular  order.            Manny Ramírez and Álex Rodríguez     Manny and A-Rod were, honestly, the two easiest boxes for me to check this time around. Their on-field accomplishments are as good as it gets. They're two of the best right-handed hitters ever and Rodríguez is one of the best all-around players to ever play the game. He's one of only 32 players in the 100-WAR club and he has the highest baseball IQ of any player I've seen. Off-the-charts fundamentals and historic production. A-Rod was put on this planet to play baseball. He and Manny have first ballot numbers.     That said, neither Manny nor A-Rod are anywhere close to the 75% threshold for induction (they're both under 50% on the public ballot tracker as I write this) because of their PEDs ties. In their cases, it's not speculative. Ramírez tested positive twice and was suspended twice. A-Rod admitted his PED use (eventually) and served the longest PED suspension in baseball history in 2014. They did it. We know it for a fact and PEDs are the only reason these two will almost certainly never get into the Hall of Fame.     \nI have no issue with anyone, including my colleague Matt Snyder, who doesn't give Manny, A-Rod, and all the other PED guys their Hall of Fame vote. I try not to moralize and keep these things simple. Manny and A-Rod were punished in accordance with the rules of the time and served their suspensions. It's case closed. They were punished and I don't believe in punishing them further. Put \"suspended for PEDs\" right on their Hall of Fame plaques for all I care. It's part of their legacy. We can acknowledge it.     Also, I think it's very hypocritical that Bud Selig, who oversaw MLB making money hand over fist during the Steroid Era and didn't crack down on PEDs until the players pushed for testing, is in the Hall  of Fame while these players are not. I take the responsibility of being a Hall of Fame voter seriously and I don't believe it means punishing players who have already been punished. Testing and discipline rules were in place and and Manny and A-Rod were  punished accordingly. That's enough for me.          Carlos Beltrán     A true five-tool talent, Beltrán was pretty close to the perfect player at his peak. He hit for average and power. He got on base. He's one of the most efficient basestealers in history and he stole with high volume. He was also a terrific defensive center fielder. Beltrán has the counting stats (2,725 hits, 435 homers, 312 steals) and he had a Hall of Fame-worthy peak from 2003-11: .283/.371/.511 (131 OPS+) with 220 homers and 184 steals, and 5.0 WAR per season. His legendary 2004 postseason (20 for 46 with eight homers) is another feather in his cap. For me, Beltrán was an easy yes. He clears my Hall of Fame bar and then some.     \nThe only real knock on Beltrán's Hall of Fame worthiness is his involvement in the Astros' sign-stealing scandal at the end of his career. He was the only player named in MLB's investigation  (he publicly acknowledged his involvement afterward), which was  conducted after Beltrán retired, and was identified as something of a ringleader. Beltrán was not disciplined because no player was disciplined as a result of the investigation. The Astros were hit hard by penalties. The players skated. Beltrán did, however, \"mutually part ways\" with the Mets  soon after being named their manager because the scandal had become a  distraction.      Similar to Manny and A-Rod, my thoughts on Beltrán's  sign-stealing scandal involvement is that the league investigated and  handed out the discipline it deemed fit, which in this case was none. He suffered some reputational damage and that's really it. I just don't believe in punishing players (by withholding my Hall of Fame vote) who have already been punished.          The longevity starting pitchers     I voted for four starting pitchers and I mentally have them playing in two different eras even though their careers overlapped quite a bit. The older of those four starters are lefty workhorses Mark Buehrle and Andy Pettitte, who got my Hall of Fame vote moreso because of their longevity than a towering peak. Neither was one of the four best pitchers of their era because they played at the same time as Roger  Clemens, Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux, and Pedro Martinez. Buehrle and Pettitte were both very good every year for the better part of two decades though. Their careers numbers are quite similar:    \n       BuehrlePettitteYears \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2000-15 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1995-2013 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tInnings \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3,283 ⅓ \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3,316 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tW-L \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t214-160 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t256-153 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tERA \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.81 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3.85 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tERA+ \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t117 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t117 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tK/BB \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2.55 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2.37 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tWAR \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t60.0 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t60.7 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t7-year peak WAR \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t35.8 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t34.1 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTo put that another way, Buehrle averaged 205 innings and 3.8 WAR per year for 16 years. Pettitte averaged 175 innings and 3.2 WAR per year for 19 years, plus he's the all-time leader in postseason starts (44) and postseason innings (276 ⅔ innings). Pettitte played an extra month all those years with the Yankees and had one fewer month to recover each offseason, yet he posted up every single season. His durability -- and Buehrle's -- was simply remarkable.    These two also have signature moments. Buehrle threw a no-hitter and a perfect game, and was the ace of a World Series winner. Pettitte had several terrific postseason performances, most notably the pivotal Game 5 of the 1996 World Series. Did you know Buehrle was second only to Hall of Famer Roy Halladay in pitching WAR from 2000-15? My Hall of Fame ballot is not strictly a \"he met this WAR threshold, so he's in\" ballot, but WAR does inform my decision to some extent. Buehrle had an incredible run.    Only 57 pitchers in history have thrown at least 3,000 career innings with a 115 ERA+ or better; only 23 of those 57 started their careers after baseball first expanded in 1961. Buehrle and Pettitte are two of the 23. Their sheer volume of high quality innings is enough to get my Hall of Fame vote. They may not have ever been the best pitcher in their league, but Buehrle and Pettitte were so good for so long.        The peak value starting pitchers     The other two starters I voted for, Cole Hamels and Félix Hernández, received my Hall of Fame vote because of their peaks more than their longevity, though both played a good long time. Hernández in particular has a strong argument for being the American League's best pitcher from about 2009 through 2014. During those six years, he ranked (minimum 1,000 innings):    1st in innings (1,394 ⅓)2nd in ERA (2.73)3rd in ERA+ (141)1st in strikeouts (1,358)2nd in WAR (33.4)That's a six-year run averaging 232.4 innings and 5.6 WAR per season. Clayton Kershaw was at the height of his powers those years. He was the best pitcher in baseball. Hernández wasn't too far behind him at No. 2. He won a Cy Young (2009), could have won two more (runner-up in 2009 and 2014), and has a signature moment in his perfect game. Félix never got the opportunity to star in the postseason because the Mariners and their front office let him down. It stinks for him and all of us.    Sandwich several other strong seasons around that tremendous six-year peak, and Hernández did enough to get my vote. I will admit that he's on the lower end of what I would consider a Hall of Fame starting pitcher, mostly because he was done as an effective starter by age 31, but at his best, Hernández was about as good as anyone the game has seen the last 40 years or so. Compared to the historical standard for starting pitchers, no way is Hernández a Hall of Famer. My vote stems from me comparing a player to his era and only his era, and King Félix was one of the best to do it in the 2000s and 2010s.    As for Hamels, he had a longer stretch as one of the game's top starters than Hernández (3.81 ERA in 141 ⅔ innings at age 35, for example), though it is again the peak that does it here. Hamels averaged 202.7 innings and 4.5 WAR a year from 2007-17, and 4 WAR is right about where guys get to the All-Star Game and receive Cy Young consideration. Hamels never did win a Cy Young, but he was top eight in the voting four times, and he was the ace of a World Series winner at age 23 (he was the NLCS and World Series MVP in 2008). Plus we can add a no-hitter on top of that.     Hamels followed the usual aging curve beautifully. He was very good early in his career, at his best in his mid-to-late 20s, then he had a graceful decline in his 30s. Only 24 pitchers started their careers after baseball expanded in 1961 and finished with a 120 ERA+ or better in 2,500 innings. Hamels is one of them, and he ranked eighth in the 2000s and 2010s in pitching WAR despite not making his MLB debut until 2006. It's a \"top five pitcher in baseball\" peak with nice longevity as well. Like Hernández, Hamels was one of the best players of his era and that's how I evaluate starting pitchers for the Hall of Fame.        Bobby Abreu    Criminally underrated during his heyday, Abreu authored a .308/.416/.525 (143 OPS+) line and averaged 41 doubles, 23 homers, and 29 steals per season from 1998-2004. He was also a very good defensive outfielder in his prime (not so much later in his career). Abreu finished his career with 2,470 hits and 1,476 walks (20th  all-time!), and is top 50 in career times on base. He reached base more times than Tony Gwynn (3,979 vs. 3,955) in fewer plate appearances (10,232 vs. 10,081). I say that not to diminish Gwynn, who I think is the best pure hitter of the last 50 years, but to elevate Abreu. I get that he's a stathead Hall of Famer more than a traditional choice, but I'm a stathead, and a Hall of Famer is a Hall of Famer to me. Abreu was getting on base at elite clips before it was cool and he was an all-around impact guy at his peak. He hit well, he ran the bases well, he defended well, and he did it for almost two decades.        \tChase Utley     There is a pretty good argument to be made that Utley was baseball's second-best player behind Albert Pujols from about 2005 to 2009, a five-year stretch in which he hit .298/.388/.523 (133 OPS+) while averaging 27 homers and 15 steals per season. Add in excellent second base defense and only Pujols (44.6 WAR) bested Utley's 39.7 WAR those five years. That's a Hall of Fame peak to me, and not by a small margin either. Utley also had a gentle decline phase, putting up 3 WAR seasons well into his 30s before settling as a role player near the end. What a ballplayer this guy was. Well-rounded, hard-nosed, and clutch. He was the best player on those powerhouse late-2000s Phillies teams even though he wasn't the one winning MVPs. I have Utley as the best second baseman of his generation and one of the best of all time, really.        Andruw Jones    Like Félix Hernández, I would have voted for Jones last year if I had room on my ballot, but I did not. So it goes with the 10-vote limit. Jones was the greatest defensive center fielder of his generation and one of the greatest ever, and he did that while slashing .270/.347/.513 (119 OPS+) during his prime years from 1998-2006. The average Andruw season was 35 home runs and 6.1 WAR during that nine-season stretch. Jones was done as an everyday player by age 31, though he came up so very young -- he is the youngest player in history with a two-homer game in the World Series (age 19 in 1996) -- that he still put together a lengthy Hall of Fame career. I wonder if the perception of Jones' career would be different if he had his peak from, say, ages 23-32 instead of 20-29? He gets dinged for being done at a relatively young age, but he was still so good for so long.        Others considered     I voted for the maximum 10 players and, if I had room, I would have strongly considered voting for Dustin Pedroia and David Wright as well. I'm not 100% convinced they're Hall of Famers, though I would have given both a vote to do what I can to keep them over the 5% threshold to stay on the ballot another year so I could consider them further in the future. Like Andruw Jones, Pedroia and Wright were both done as everyday players in their early 30s, though Jones had a greater peak, so he got my vote.    Jimmy Rollins played for a long time and had some terrific seasons, plus retiring with 2,455 hits and 470 steals (and an MVP) is nothing to scoff at. Ultimately, there were too many seasons where Rollins was a below-average hitter (100 OPS+ only five times from 2001-15), and good shortstop defense and elite baserunning only counts for so much to me. Rollins is in the Hall of Very Good for me and not quite in the Hall of Fame. The peak was quite short and the longevity was more good years than great years.    There are no bad players on the Hall of Fame ballot. This year's ballot covers nearly three decades of baseball and only 27 of the thousands of players to play those years are on the ballot. Just getting here is an accomplishment. So although I didn't vote for Matt Kemp and Francisco Rodríguez and 15 others, I just want to say they were all very good players who carved out there own little place in baseball history. You don't have to be a Hall of Famer to make a mark on the game, and these 27 players all did.    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        I don't want to say that the NFL should cancel the rest of the postseason, but the league might want to give it some serious thought because there's no way anything is going to top what happened on Wild Card Weekend. The Panthers almost pulled off a total shocker, the Bears pulled off a miracle comeback, the Jaguars got Josh Allen'd, the 49ers pulled off the biggest upset of the round and the Chargers tried. At least I think they tried. Once the Chargers get into the playoffs, it's hard to tell what they're doing. Same with the Steelers. Now, we're moving on to the divisional round where things tend to be much more predictable, but since there's been nothing predictable about this entire season, I'm going to go ahead and assume that all four games are going to be totally unpredictable.  Normally, the key to picking games in the divisional round is to not overthink it, which could be a problem for me because I overthink everything. I mean, I just told you that the divisional round is usually predictable, but then also said that nothing predictable has happened this season, so the divisional round will probably be unpredictable and the most unpredictable possibility in an unpredictable season would be for something predictable to happen. No one would predict that. I told you, I overthink everything. \n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's NFL divisional picks: Bills, Josh Allen too much for Broncos D, Rams end Bears' Cinderella season\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe reason you don't want to overthink things in the divisional round is because the home team usually dominates. Over the past 11 years, home teams have gone 32-12, which basically means we're getting an average of roughly one upset per year, so I'm going to go ahead and plan to pick one upset. Maybe two. Who knows. Also, teams favored by a touchdown or more in the divisional round have gone 20-4 straight up since the 2014 season, which would seem to favor the Seahawks, who are favored by seven points. So am I going to automatically pick every road team to lose? Am I actually going to pick one upset? Are the Seahawks a lock to win? Does any of this mean anything? Let's get to the picks and find out. \nOdds courtesy of DraftKings SportsbookNFL divisional round picks(6) San Francisco (13-5) at (1) Seattle (14-3)Saturday, 8 p.m. ET (Fox, Fubo, try for free)\nWell, here we go again. For the third time this season, the Seahawks and 49ers are facing each other. They opened the year with a game in Week 1, they closed the year against each other in Week 18, and now, they'll play one more time with a trip to the NFC title game on the line. Let's check out the scores from the previous two games: Week 1: 49ers 17-13 over SeahawksWeek 18: Seahawks 13-3 over 49ersThere were only two games all year where the 49ers defense held a team with a winning record to 13 points or less and both of those came against Seattle. The 49ers defense tends to struggle, unless they're facing the Seahawks.  If the Seahawks have one advantage going into the game, it's the fact that the 49ers are already complaining about the schedule. If you're complaining, you've already lost, even if you have a legitimate gripe. The Niners had to play on Sunday in Philadelphia, and now, they have to turn around and play on a short week in Seattle. This will mark the third time in four games that the 49ers have had to play on a short week. Kyle Shanahan pleaded with the NFL to give his team a Sunday game this week, but the NFL ignored him, and let me just say Kyle, I know that feeling. My 5-year-old ignores me whenever I tell her to clean up her room. \nNow, in Shanahan's defense, if there's one team that could have used an extra day of rest, it's definitely the 49ers. The team has been banged up all year: Their players have combined to miss a total of 263 games due to injury this year, which is the fifth-most in the NFL. Oh, and the injuries continued to pile up during the wild card round with George Kittle tearing his Achilles against the Eagles. After the injury happened, Kittle did what anyone in his situation would do: He pounded a bottle of tequila. \nAnyway, the point here is that the 49ers won't have Kittle this week. The 49ers put up just 173 yards against the Seahawks in Week 18 WITH KITTLE and I can't imagine things are going to get much better without him. \nI have a hard time seeing the 49ers light up the scoreboard, so it's going to be on the San Francisco's defense to keep this close. The good news is that they might actually be up to the task. Not only do they get to face a Seahawks' offense that they've held to 13 points per game this year, but they get to face Sam Darnold. During the regular season, Darnold struggled against the 49ers: He was held under 200 yards passing in both games and he threw exactly zero touchdown passes. Darnold tends to struggle in big games and I don't expect that to change here. As a matter of fact, I won't be surprised if the Seahawks take the game out of his hands by running the ball 40 times. The Seahawks are not going to let Sam Darnold lose this game for them. Seattle ran the ball 39 times against the 49ers back in Week 18 and I fully expect to see a similar game plan on Saturday. \nThe Seahawks are healthy, they're going to be rested and they're playing at home. On the other hand, the 49ers are not healthy, they're not going to be rested and they're not playing at home. So I should obviously take Seattle here, right? I've mentioned this 17 times this year, so I don't think it will hurt if I mention it again, but the 49ers were my preseason pick to win the Super Bowl, which makes it very easy for me to talk myself into a 49ers win here. The offense struggled in Week 18, but they didn't have three-time All-Pro Trent Williams, who should be on the field this week. They also could have Ricky Pearsall, who would help Brock Purdy stretch the field. And let's not forget about that fact that Kyle Shanahan has NEVER lost in the divisional round (5-0) and Purdy has never lost in Seattle (4-0).I almost talked myself into going bang bang Niner gang for the win, but I think the 49ers are too bang banged up to pull it off. \nPICK: Seahawks 19-16 over 49ersRecord picking 49ers games this season: 12-6Record picking Seahawks games this season: 13-4Record picking Seahawks-49ers games this season: 1-1(6) Buffalo (13-5) at (1) Denver (14-3)Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Stream on Paramount+)\nThis could definitely go down as the best day ever for people named Sean with Sean McDermott facing Sean Payton for the right to go to the AFC title game. The only way this could get any better is if they played the game on Sean Connery's birthday. And let's not forget, we could still get a Sean vs. Sean Super Bowl if one of these two teams ends up facing Rams' coach Sean McVay. Anyway, the last time we saw these two teams on the field together came last January when the Bills destroyed the Broncos, 31-7, in the wild card round. \nHave the Broncos gotten better since then? Yes. Have the Bills gotten worse? Yes. Have the Broncos closed a 24-point gap? I'm not so sure about that. I'm guessing that Broncos fans were rooting hard for the Chargers on Sunday night, because if L.A. had won, then Denver would be hosting the Chargers in this game. Instead, the Broncos are getting their worst nightmare, a matchup with a Bills team that is built to beat them. If you want to beat the Bills, you have to be able to run the ball, but the Broncos haven't really been able to do that this season. They averaged 118.7 yards per game on the ground, which ranked 16th overall in the NFL. That number has been even worse over the past four weeks with the Broncos average just 108.5 yards per game. If you can run on the Bills, you can control the clock and that keeps Josh Allen off the field. If the Broncos can't get their run game going, it could be a long day. All three of Denver's losses this season came in game where they were held under 120 rushing yards. If the Broncos can't the run the ball, that will put the game in Bo Nix's hands, and that could be trouble, especially against a Sean McDermott defense. McDermott came up with a game plan last year that Nix struggled against. The Broncos QB went 3 of 3 for 64 yards in the first quarter of last year's playoff game, but then went just 10 of 19 for 80 yards over the final three quarters. That doesn't mean we'll see the same thing this year, but Nix is a streaky quarterback and it's impossible to predict which version of him will show up on Saturday. We could see the Nix who threw for 302 yards and four touchdowns in a huge December win over the Packers or we could see the Nix who threw for just 182 yards in a nail-biting Christmas Day win over a Chiefs team that didn't have Patrick Mahomes. \nNix thrives when he's forced out of the pocket -- he completed a league-high 80 passes from out of the pocket in 2025 -- but he'll be facing a Bills defense that allowed the fewest completions outside the pocket in the NFL this year. If the Broncos have one advantage this week, it's the fact that they're coming off a bye while the Bills will be coming off a short week after playing on Sunday in the wild card round. Not only are the Bills on a short week, but they have to deal with the mile high air. It's not an easy adjustment and it's a big reason why the Broncos have won four straight home playoff games. Also, Sean Payton has NEVER lost a playoff game coming off a bye (4-0). He's the new Andy Reid.The only thing standing between the Broncos and their first AFC title berth in 10 years is Josh Allen, but unfortunately for Denver, that's a big obstacle. In the wild card round, Allen led his first career game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game, and now, I'll say he takes one step closer to getting to his first career Super Bowl. \nPICK: Bills 23-20 over BroncosRecord picking Bills games this season: 11-7Record picking Broncos games this season: 13-4(5) Texans (13-5) at (2) New England (15-3)Sunday, 3 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC; Fubo, try for free)\nHouston, we have a problem, and that problem is that the Texans got stuck playing in the dreaded Monday night game during the wild-card round, which has been a nightmare for almost everyone who has ever played in it. Over the past three years, four teams have won on Monday in the wild-card round and they've combined to go 0-4 in the divisional round, which makes it sound like I should stop thinking about this pick right now and just take the Patriots.The Texans are also the only team in NFL history that has never won a divisional round game. As a matter of fact, if you're a fan of the Texans, you might not even be aware that there are more playoff rounds AFTER the divisional round because Houston has never made it that far.The Texans have existed since 2002 and since then, they've played in the divisional round a total of six times and they've gone 0-6. Two of those six losses have come against the Patriots, and now, everyone in Houston will be hoping that the third time is the charm. This game is going to feature two of the best defenses in the NFL and the more I think about it, the more I think that the final score could end up being 11-8. Mike Vrabel is a defensive genius who came up with such a good game plan against the Chargers that he confused a former NFL quarterback. \n\"I have absolutely no idea what coverage they're in\" is probably what Justin Herbert was thinking for half the game against the Patriots. The other half of the time, he was probably thinking, \"Oh crap, I'm about to get sacked again.\"If Vrabel was able to confuse Herbert, there's a good chance he'll be able to confuse C.J. Stroud, who might be the QB I trust the least out of all the quarterbacks still in the playoffs. Stroud fumbled the ball FIVE TIMES against the Steelers on Monday night, which was the most by any player in 31 years. The Texans offense still has yet to top 20 points in any road game this season and I have a hard time seeing that changing against a Patriots defense that gave up just 18.8 points per game during the regular season, which was the fourth-fewest in the NFL. Not only is Stroud facing a tough defense, but he might not have Nico Collins on the field. The Texans star receiver might not play after suffering a concussion on Monday night. The biggest question in this game is how will Drake Maye react to playing a good defense for the first time this season? Maye has not had to face a top-five defense all season, but that will change in this game. The Texans gave up the fewest yards in the NFL (277.2 yards per game), they gave up the second-fewest points (17.4 per game), they gave up less than 100 yards rushing per game and they're good at stopping the pass. I don't know how it's possible, but they're good at EVERYTHING. I give the Texans the edge on defense and I give the Patriots the edge on offense, and well, the old adage doesn't say anything about offenses winning championships, it definitely says that defenses win championships, so I'm going with the better defense. PICK: Texans 19-16 over PatriotsRecord picking Texans games this season: 12-6Record picking Patriots games this season: 13-5L.A. Rams (13-5) at Chicago (12-6)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)\nWhen I see that a team from California is playing a team from the Midwest on the road in January, the first thing I usually do is Google the weather for the game, so I decided to Google Chicago's weather for Sunday, and I have some bad news for the Rams: It's going to be cold.   \nThe forecast for this week's game is calling for a high of 15 degrees -- with a wind chill possibly below zero -- and you know who's not going to be fazed by that? The Bears. On other hand, I'm starting to have a feeling that the weather might end up being a problem for the Rams. If you've ever been to Los Angeles, you may have noticed that people start wearing jackets there when the temperature falls below 65 degrees. And as someone who lived in Southern California for two years, I can tell you from first-hand experience that people in Southern California don't go outside if the temperature drops below 60 degrees. No Californian has ever experienced sub-60 degree weather unless it was by accident. As for the game, Sean McVay is arguably the best coach in the NFL right now, but there's one thing he still hasn't done in his career and that's win a game in Chicago. McVay is 0-2 in the Windy City and if he wants to end that streak, he's probably going to need to have his team practice in Antartica this week, because that's the only way he's going to be able to simulate the weather that's expected in Chicago. The big question in this game is whether Matthew Stafford is going to be able to throw the ball in arctic conditions. If he can, the Rams could roll to a win, but if he can't, then the Bears might be able to pull off the upset. Not only will Stafford be dealing with the cold weather, but he also sprained a finger on his throwing hand in the wild card round, which could impact his ability to throw the football. After the injury happened, Stafford went 4 of 19 on his next 23 passes, before rebounding to throw for 143 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter against Carolina. McVay said Stafford's finger is OK, but I feel like he has to say that.One thing about Stafford is that he almost never has to play in weather like this. In his 17-year career, he's played in just FOUR games where the temperature was under 30 degrees. In those four games, he went 2-2 and he's averaged 186 passing yards per game with six touchdowns and just one interception. His numbers aren't great, but he could have some success this weekend. The Bears defense led the NFL in interceptions this year, but if they weren't picking off a pass, then they were getting picked apart. The Bears gave up the 11th most passing yards in the NFL and the fifth-most touchdown passes, and now, they have to stop the QB who led the NFL in both of those categories. Chicago's defense could certainly get some help from the cold weather, but I could also see Stafford having a big game. When you're playing in the cold weather, it helps if you can run the ball well and if the Bears can get their rushing attack going, that could open door for an upset. The Rams are just 1-3 this season when they surrender 140 yards or more on the ground, and as I mention every week, the Bears are undefeated (8-0) when they top 140 rushing yards. I hate picking against the Bears, because they seem to find a crazy new way to win every week, but I can't pick against Stafford. PICK: Rams 27-20 over BearsRecord picking Rams games this season: 13-5Record picking Bears games this season: 10-8Last Week Best pick: Last week, I predicted that the 49ers would go into Philadelphia and pull off the biggest upset of the wild card round and guess what happened? The 49ers went into Philadelphia and pulled off the biggest upset of the wild card round. Now, did I know that the Eagles were going to forget how to run their offense? Of course, I did. If you watched the Eagles play a single game this year, then you already knew what was going to happen, because every game is the same: The Eagles will run one or two big plays and then Kevin Patullo calls 10 straight plays that make no sense. The Eagles offense is essentially a Ferrari with my grandma driving, but also, it has one flat tire. If they get the tire fixed and get a new driver in there, they should be OK, but who knows if that will actually happen. The 49ers ended up winning 23-19, which I'm only pointing out, because we came ONE POINT AWAY from a Breechigami. That is where I predict the exact score of a game and if Jake Elliott didn't miss an extra point on Sunday, we would have had our first Breechigami of the year and I would have celebrated by taking down a George Kittle-sized bottle of tequila. Worst pick: Last week, I decided that this would finally be the year that the Chargers would stop Chargering in the playoffs, but the joke's on me, because that definitely didn't happen. Anyone who has ever watched the Chargers play a single game in the postseason knew there was a 500% chance they were going to lose, but I picked them to win anyway. Justin Herbert is now 0-3 in the playoffs in his career, which means he is now officially entering Andy Dalton territory. Herbert is one of just four quarterbacks since 2000 to lose each of his first three playoff starts, a list that he is on with Dalton. In a fitting twist, Dalton, who is Carolina's backup QB, also lost during the wild card round. Picks recordStraight up in wild-card round: 3-3SU overall in playoffs: 3-3Against the spread in wild-card round: 2-4ATS overall in playoffs: 2-4Final 2025 regular season recordStraight up: 166-105-1Against the spread: 129-140-3You can find John Breech on Facebook or Twitter and if he's not doing one of those things, he's probably hitting up local liquor stores to see if he can find a George Kittle-sized bottle of tequila. \n            ",

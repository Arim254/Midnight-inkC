Sam Darnold was a top-three quarterback. Rico Dowdle was the No. 2 running back. And Theo Johnson and Darren Waller were both top-five tight ends.</p><p>Now, let's see if there are any plug-and-play options off the waiver wire to help in Week 6.</p><p>There are only two teams on a bye in Week 6 with Minnesota and Houston, but we still have several injuries to monitor, notably for Omarion Hampton (ankle), who was placed on injured reserve. With Hampton out, it will likely be a tandem of Kimani Vidal and Hassan Haskins, which could be messy, but we'll address that below.</p><p>Kenneth Gainwell will be the top running back to add this week, but keep an eye on if Michael Carter is still available. And we'll have other running backs to add as well, including Kendre Miller, Tyrone Tracy Jr. and Tyjae Spears.</p>\n<p>At wide receiver, the top player to add this week is Kendrick Bourne, especially if Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Jauan Jennings (knee) remain out in San Francisco. Other receivers to add include Tre Tucker, Rashid Shaheed and Jalen Coker (quadriceps), who will hopefully make his 2025 debut in Week 6.</p><p>Darnold is the No. 1 quarterback to add for Week 6, but don't forget about Tua Tagovailoa and Mac Jones, who could get another start in place of Brock Purdy (toe). And the top tight ends to add this week include Mason Taylor, A.J. Barner, Theo Johnson and Jake Tonges, who are all coming off strong performances in Week 5.</p><p>We'll also have streaming DST and kicker options for you to add as well. It's that time of year where injuries and bye weeks are wreaking havoc on your roster, but the waiver wire is here to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Editor's note:</strong> <em>For this waiver wire column, we are only looking at players rostered in less than 65 percent of CBS Sports leagues.</em></p><h6>\n        Week 6 Waivers\n    </h6>\n<p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Quarterbacks\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><p>On a bye: C.J. Stroud, Carson Wentz and J.J. McCarthy.</p><p>Injuries: Lamar Jackson (hamstring), Brock Purdy (toe), Joe Burrow (toe) and J.J. McCarthy (ankle).</p><p>Check to see if available in shallow leagues: C.J. Stroud (70 percent rostered). Stroud is playing well going into his bye in Week 6 with back-to-back games with at least 22.4 Fantasy points. It helps that he's faced the Titans and Ravens in those two games, and his schedule post-bye isn't easy with matchups against Seattle, San Francisco and Denver out of the gate. That said, if Stroud can recapture the form from his rookie season, which he looked like the past two weeks, we could have a low-end No. 1 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues to close the year.</p>\n<p>Drop candidates: Geno Smith (51 percent rostered). You have to wonder if the Raiders are considering benching Smith if he continues to play like he has in the past two games against Chicago and Indianapolis where he combined for 345 yards, two touchdowns and five interceptions. Fantasy managers in one-quarterback leagues can't start him, so he's droppable in those formats. And he's a questionable starting option in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues heading into Week 6 against Tennessee, but don't drop him there. Just stash him on your bench for now, but it's ugly for Smith, especially with Brock Bowers (knee) hurt. </p><p><strong>Add in this order: </strong></p><div><div><p>Week 6 Waiver Priority

with 35.6 points, and he should be considered a borderline No. 1 quarterback in all leagues heading into Week 6 at Jacksonville. Darnold had scored between 18.1 and 20.7 Fantasy points in his three games prior to facing the Buccaneers, so he was already on the cusp of a borderline starter in all leagues. He attempted a season-high 34 passes against Tampa Bay, and more volume will definitely help Fantasy managers trust him. He's worth adding for up to 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team

ironically had his best game of the season in the first outing without Tyreek Hill (knee) with 28.7 Fantasy points. It helped that he played Carolina, but Tagovailoa has now combined for 433 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions in his past two games against the Jets and Panthers. Things get a little tougher in Week 6 against the Chargers, Tagovailoa is worth trusting as a low-end starter in all one-quarterback leagues. Even without Hill, he still has plenty of weapons in Jaylen Waddle, Darren Waller and De'Von Achane. And Miami's defense will force Tagovailoa into several shootouts or comeback efforts, making him worth adding for up to 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n

                <p>\n                Brock Purdy (toe) could return in Week 6 at Tampa Bay, so keep that in mind for Jones. But if Jones starts again then he's worth using as a low-end starter in all one-quarterback leagues, and he's a must-start option in Superflex and two-quarterback formats. He's now started three games for the 49ers in place of Purdy, and Jones has scored at least 26.2 Fantasy points in two of those outings. And he has a great matchup against the Buccaneers, who are No. 7 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. Jones should be added in all one-quarterback leagues for at least 5 percent of your remaining FAB. And he's worth 10-15 percent in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

earned a win against the Dolphins in Week 5, but he only scored 16.0 Fantasy points. This was the first game of a tremendous three-game stretch for Young against the Dolphins, Cowboys and Jets, so hopefully he'll perform better as a Fantasy quarterback in those matchups, starting with Dallas in Week 6. The Cowboys are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and Young is worth using as a low-end starter in all leagues in that matchup.

That's not an easy matchup, and Gabriel scored 20.1 Fantasy points with 190 passing yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, along with two carries for 5 yards. He has another tough matchup at Pittsburgh in Week 6, but Gabriel should be added in all Superflex and two-quarterback leagues for at least 15-20 percent of your remaining FAB. He could turn into a weekly starter in those formats if he continues to perform like he did against the Vikings.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Running Backs\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><p>On a bye: Jordan Mason, Aaron Jones, Zavier Scott, Nick Chubb and Woody Marks. </p><p>Injuries: Omarion Hampton (ankle), Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot), Chuba Hubbard (calf), Jaylen Warren (knee), Aaron Jones (hamstring), Antonio Gibson (knee), Trey Benson (knee), Tyrone Tracy Jr. (shoulder), Joe Mixon (foot), Braelon Allen (knee) and Miles Sanders (ankle).</p><p>Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Rico Dowdle (83 percent rostered), Bhayshul Tuten (76 percent) and Michael Carter (67 percent). Dowdle was a monster against the Dolphins in Week 5 as the starter for the Panthers in place of Hubbard with 32.4 PPR points. We don't know if Hubbard will play in Week 6, but Dowdle will be a must-start running back if Hubbard is out against Dallas in a revenge game. ... I'll update this post for Tuten after Monday night's game against Kansas City, but I still want to roster Tuten in all leagues, even if he's just a handcuff for Travis Etienne. ... Carter did fine as the starter for the Cardinals in place of Benson with 18 carries for 51 yards and a touchdown and five catches for 22 yards on five targets in Week 5 against Tennessee. I doubt Emari Demercado will be a huge threat to Carter's workload in Week 6 at Indianapolis, and Carter is worth trusting as a low-end No. 2 running back in all leagues against the Colts.</p>\n<p>Drop candidates: Emari Demercado (87 percent rostered), Ollie Gordon II (64 percent) and Sean Tucker (38 percent). I like how Demercado owned up to his fumble at the goal line in Week 5 against Tennessee, but it's hard to expect him getting more work after that mistake. And he only had three carries for 81 yards in the game, along with no targets, while Carter dominated touches. ... Gordon can be rostered as the handcuff for De'Von Achane if you want, but he doesn't have much standalone value right now. In his past two games against the Jets and Panthers, Gordon has combined for nine carries for 8 yards and one target. ... Tucker is worth rostering as the handcuff for Rachaad White while Irving is out, but it's clear that White will handle the majority of touches until Irving returns. In the first game without Irving in Week 5 at Seattle, Tucker only had three carries for 3 yards and three catches for minus-4 yards on three targets.</p><p><strong>Add in this order:</strong>

Pittsburgh's bye week. And, if Warren is able to play, we don't know how the Steelers will use both running backs after Gainwell was awesome in place of an injured Warren in Week 4 against Minnesota in Ireland. In that game, Gainwell had 19 carries for 99 yards and two touchdowns and six catches for 35 yards on six targets. I'm going to lean toward Warren getting his starting job back, but Gainwell probably deserves more work moving forward. And if Warren is out again then Gainwell is a must-start running back in all leagues. He's worth adding for at least 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/428.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        LAC\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        L.A.

This is speculative as of Monday, but in Week 5 against Washington, Vidal had four carries for 18 yards and one catch for 1 yard on one target, while Haskins had five carries for 13 yards and one catch for 2 yards on one target. In two drives without Hampton against the Commanders, Vidal played more snaps and ran more routes than Haskins, while both handled the same amount of carries. We will hopefully get an answer during the week on who will lead the backfield in place of Hampton, but I would add Vidal first for up to 10 percent of your remaining FAB, with Haskins right behind him at 5-10 percent. The Chargers have an unbelievable matchup in Week 6 against the Dolphins, who are No. 6 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, so Vidal or Haskins could be a borderline starter in all leagues. The other running back can still be a potential flex option as well, and then we'll see what happens going forward until Hampton returns.\n            </p>\n

more carries than Alvin Kamara, and Miller played a season-high 39 percent of the snaps. He had 10 carries for 41 yards and one catch for 8 yards on one target, and Miller now has 21 carries for 106 yards and a touchdown in his past two outings against the Bills and Giants. Over that same span, Kamara had 23 carries for 97 yards and no touchdowns, but he did have eight catches for 30 yards on 11 targets. I'm still starting Kamara ahead of Miller, but this is a problem for the former and good news for the latter. You should be stashing Miller in all leagues for up to 10 percent of your remaining FAB, and he's a lottery ticket in case Kamara were to miss any time due to injury.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/422.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYG\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

Cam Skattebo has played well in place of Tracy in the past two games and will likely remain the starter, but Skattebo had a key fumble in Week 5 at New Orleans, which could help Tracy when he's healthy. He's worth stashing on your bench for up to 5 percent of your FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

did little in his 2025 debut with four carries for 14 yards and no targets in Week 5 at Arizona. He missed the first four games of the season with an ankle injury, so he was likely shaking off the rust. Spears will continue to play behind Tony Pollard, and Spears should get more work as the season goes on. He's a good running back to stash on your bench heading into Week 6 against the Raiders for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n

off the field due to cramps. Thankfully, that's all it was, but Etienne is now No. 2 on the depth chart for the Panthers while Chuba Hubbard (calf) is out. Dowdle was dominant against the Dolphins with 23 carries for 206 yards and a touchdown and three catches for 28 yards on four targets. Etienne also added four carries for 22 yards and one catch for 7 yards on one target. He's worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/423.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYJ\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

               <p>\n                Wilson is worth stashing in deeper leagues coming out of Green Bay's bye in Week 5 since he's the handcuff to Josh Jacobs. We'll see what happens with MarShawn Lloyd (hamstring) when healthy, but it appears like Wilson is the No. 2 running back for the Packers moving forward. In the past two games against the Browns and Cowboys, Wilson had 14 carries for 69 yards and three catches for 37 yards on three targets. He's worth adding for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p><span>\n    <a></a>\n    <div>\n                            <p>\n                    WAIVER WIRE\n                </p>\n                            <h6>\n                    Wide Receivers\n                </h6>\n                    </div>\n            </span></p><p>On a bye: Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, Adam Thielen, Jalen Nailor, Nico Collins, Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel.</p><p>Injuries: Darius Slayton (hamstring), Ricky Pearsall (knee), Jauan Jennings (ankle), Darnell Mooney (hamstring), Calvin Austin III (shoulder), CeeDee Lamb (ankle), Mike Evans (hamstring), Terry McLaurin (quadriceps), KeVontae Turpin (foot), Cedric Tillman (hamstring), Jayden Reed (collarbone), Brandon Aiyuk (knee), Jalen Coker (quadriceps), Alec Pierce (concussion), Christian Watson (knee) and Jalen McMillan (neck).</p>\n<p>Check to see if available in shallow leagues: Wan'Dale Robinson (82 percent rostered), Cooper Kupp (78 percent), Matthew Golden (76 percent), Jauan Jennings (74 percent), Romeo Doubs (72 percent) and Calvin Ridley (72 percent). Robinson had five catches for 30 yards on seven targets in Week 5 at New Orleans, and he might be the best receiver for the Giants moving forward if Darius Slayton (hamstring) is out for an extended period of time. ... Kupp just had nine targets in Week 5 against Tampa Bay and finished with six catches for 59 yards. He's still worth stashing in all PPR leagues. ... Golden went into Green Bay's bye in Week 5 with nine catches for 110 yards on 10 targets in his past two games against Cleveland and Dallas. Hopefully, he's just getting started with his production, and he could emerge as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues. ... Jennings isn't guaranteed to play in Week 6 at Tampa Bay after missing Week 5 with an ankle injury. But when healthy, Jennings can be a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues and is worth stashing where available. ... Doubs should be added in all leagues after his big game in Week 4 at Dallas with six catches for 58 yards and three touchdowns on eight targets. The Packers face the Bengals in Week 6, which should benefit the entire receiving corps in Green Bay. ... It was good to see Ridley finally do something in Week 5 at Arizona with five catches for 131 yards on 10 targets. Hopefully, it wasn't a one-hit wonder since he scored 8.7 PPR points or less in the first four games of the season, but it's worth adding Ridley in all leagues where available heading into Week 6 at Las Vegas.</p><p>Drop candidates: Jerry Jeudy (88 percent rostered), Travis Hunter (74 percent) and Rashod Bateman (44 percent). Jeudy has struggled this season and scored 9.1 PPR points or less in four games in a row, including Week 5 against Minnesota in the first start with Dillon Gabriel with two catches for 15 yards on five targets. He might surprise us in Week 6 at Pittsburgh, but you can drop Jeudy in all 10-team leagues for now. ... We'll see what Hunter does Monday night against Kansas City, but he's scored 9.3 PPR points or less in all four games prior to Week 5 with no touchdowns and no games with more than 42 receiving yards. ... Bateman combined for one catch for 24 yards on five targets in his past two games against the Chiefs and Texans. He was tough to trust with Lamar Jackson (hamstring) healthy, but it's easy to move on from Bateman in all leagues while Jackson is out. </p><p><strong>Add in this order:</strong></p><div><div><p>Week

Both missed Week 5 at the Rams, and Bourne had a breakout game with 10 catches for 142 yards on 11 targets. He should be considered at least a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues if he tops the depth chart in Week 6 against the Buccaneers, and Bourne is worth adding for at least 10 percent of your

that he will return to practice Wednesday. We hope he will play in Week 5 against Miami, and then he gets the Cowboys in Week 6 and the Jets in Week 7. We could be looking at Coker as a starting option in three-receiver leagues right away, and he should be added in all leagues for at least 10 percent of your remaining FAB. When healthy, Coker should be the No. 2 receiver for the Panthers behind Tetairoa McMillan, and Bryce Young is expected to lean heavily on Coker as a go-to target in the passing game.\n

with Brock Bowers (knee) out. Since Bowers hurt his knee in Week 1 at New England, Tucker has had three games in four outings with at least six targets. He has the potential to be a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in all leagues if Bowers is out again in Week 6 at Tennessee, and Tucker is worth adding for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n

with an 87-yard touchdown catch, and he finished the game with four catches for 114 yards and the score on five targets. He's been at six targets or less in four games in a row and finished with exactly four receptions in each outing. And, prior to Week 5, his best game of the season was 52 yards in Week 2 against San Francisco. That said, Shaheed is always capable of one big play, and he should be considered a boom-or-bust No. 3 Fantasy receiver heading into Week 6 against New England. He's worth adding for 5-10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team

But if both are out again in Week 6 then Flournoy could be a potential No. 3 Fantasy receiver in deeper leagues against the Panthers. In Week 5 at the Jets with Lamb and Turpin out, Flournoy came out of nowhere with six catches for 114 yards on nine targets. That might be the best game of his season -- or career -- but he's worth a look in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB. If Dak Prescott starts to trust Flournoy then he could emerge as the No. 3 receiver for the Cowboys moving forward behind Lamb, when healthy, and George Pickens.\n            </p>\n

Washington due to an injury, and hopefully he healed during Atlanta's bye in Week 5. It's been a tough year so far for Mooney with a shoulder injury to start the season and now this hamstring issue, and his best game was Week 3 at Carolina with 8.4 PPR points. I still expect him to be productive as the season goes on, and he's worth stashing on your bench for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n

5 against Las Vegas, and he finished with a season-best 54 yards. He's yet to score a touchdown, and he has three games with 6.4 PPR points or less. He's also been outplayed by Michael Pittman and Tyler Warren. But maybe his performance against the Raiders is the start of something, and Downs is worth a flier in deeper leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB. He could still emerge as a No. 3 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues as the season goes on.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n

When healthy, we'll see how Watson fits in with Matthew Golden, Romeo Doubs and Dontayvion Wicks, and Jayden Reed (collarbone) will also return to action later this season.

Njoku had a big game in Week 5 against Minnesota in the first start for Dillon Gabriel with six catches for 67 yards and a touchdown on nine targets. Hopefully, it's a sign of things to come, and Njoku should be added in all leagues heading into Week 6 at Pittsburgh. ... Pitts went into his bye on a high note with five catches for 70 yards and a touchdown on five targets in Week 4 against Washington. He should benefit if Darnell Mooney (hamstring) is out in Week 6 against Buffalo, but even if Mooney is healthy, Pitts should be added in all leagues.</p><p>Drop candidates: T.J. Hockenson (85 percent rostered), Juwan Johnson (68 percent) and Isaiah Likely (38 percent). Hockenson is not worth holding during his bye in Week 6. While he scored 9.8 PPR points in Week 5 against Cleveland in London, that's his second best total of the season. He has one touchdown this year, and he'll be tough to trust moving forward now that Jordan Addison is back. ... Johnson has faded with his production the past two games with a combined five catches for 45 yards and no touchdowns on just seven targets. Prior to Week 4, Johnson had at least eight targets in each of his first three games. Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau are now healthy, and Johnson is not worth rostering in most 10-team leagues. ... In two games back after missing the first three games of the season with a foot injury, Likely has combined for just one catch for 12 yards on one target. He'll be tough to trust while Lamar Jackson (hamstring) is out, and Likely can be dropped in all leagues heading into Week 6 against the Rams.</p><p><strong>Add in this order:</strong></p><div><div><p>Week 6 Waiver Priority List</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/423.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYJ\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

all leagues for at least 10 percent of your remaining FAB. He has 25 targets in his past three games, and he scored at least 11.5 PPR points in each of his past two outings against Miami and Dallas. Against the Cowboys, Taylor had nine catches for 67 yards on 12 targets, and he's become a go-to option for Justin Fields. The Broncos matchup won't be easy, but Taylor faces the Panthers and Bengals after that.

         I'll update this post after Monday night's game against the Chiefs, but Strange went into Week 5 having scored at least 10.5 PPR points in each of his past two games against Houston and San Francisco. In Week 6, Strange gets a fantastic matchup against the Seahawks, who are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends. He's worth adding in all leagues for at least 10 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"team logo\" src=\"https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/team-logos/422.svg\" /></figure>\n                                        </div>\n        <div>\n            <p><span>     \n                        NYG\n                    </span>\n                    <span>     \n                        N.Y.

outings. In Week 5 against Tampa Bay, he was featured with seven targets, and he finished with seven catches for 53 yards and two touchdowns. We'll see if that continues moving forward, but Barner is worth adding in all leagues for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB to find out. He should be considered a low-end starter in Week 6 at Jacksonville.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n    <figure><img

is a short-term add since George Kittle (hamstring) is expected to return in Week 7, and we'll see what happens with Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Jauan Jennings (ankle) in Week 6 at Tampa Bay. If Pearsall and/or Jennings are out against the Buccaneers then Tonges should be considered a borderline starter in all leagues. In Week 5 at the Rams with both receivers out, Tonges had seven catches for 41 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets. Tampa Bay just allowed two touchdowns to A.J. Barner in Week 5 in Seattle, and Tonges could once again be a prominent part of the 49ers offense if the receivers remain out. Tonges is worth adding in all leagues for up to 5 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n            </div>\n</div>\n</td></tr><tr><td><div>\n    <div>\n                    <div>\n

he'll start getting more involved for the Broncos. In Week 5 at Philadelphia, Engram had four catches for 33 yards and a touchdown on six targets, which was his first of the season, and we'll see if he can build off that performance in Week 6 at the Jets, who are No. 9 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing tight ends.

Keep an eye on Mayer's health heading into Week 6 against the Titans, and he could be worth adding in all leagues for 1 percent of your remaining FAB.\n            </p>\n

Jacksonville (3-1) has won three of its first four games for just the second time over the last 18 seasons. The Chiefs have won the last eight meetings between the teams, while the franchises have split eight all-time matchups in Jacksonville.

Kansas City is a 3.5-point road favorite in the latest Jaguars vs. Chiefs odds, down one from the opening line, and the over/under for total points scored is 45.5, down two points from the opener.

The Chiefs may be playing a different style of football than before, but what they are doing better than ever is protecting the ball. No team entered Week 5 with fewer turnovers than the one Kansas City has on the year, and the team is riding a 39-game win streak when winning the turnover battle, which is the third-longest streak by any team since 1960.</p><p>The Chiefs offense finally broke out last week as the 37 points they put on Baltimore were the most by the team in over two calendar years. In that contest, Mahomes became the fastest player to reach 250 career touchdown passes (116 games), and a good chunk of those have come on Monday nights. He owns a 27:8 TD:INT on Monday Night Football and has torched the Jaguars to historic proportions. Mahomes is the only quarterback since 1950 to be 5-0, or better, versus one team with a 70% completion rate and an average of at least 300 passing yards per game. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/chiefs-vs-jaguars-prediction-line-odds-proven-model-releases-spread-pick-for-2025-nfl-week-5-monday-night-football/#ttag=10012025_agg_cbssports_picks_football_nfl_model_ChiefsJaguarsMNF\" target=\"_blank\">See which team to back at SportsLine</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also target the latest <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/underdog/\" target=\"_blank\">Underdog promo code</a></span>, good for <a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=underdog&c=dfs\" target=\"_blank\">$100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2</a> in select states:</em></p><h2>Why the Jaguars can cover</h2><p>After ranking dead last in takeaways last season, the Jaguars have done a complete reversal and now lead the NFL with 13 takeaways entering Week 5. Not only that, but they have the best turnover differential (+9) in the NFL, and no stat correlates more with winning and losing than turnover differential. Under first-year defensive coordinator, Anthony Campanile, Jacksonville has the No. 4 run defense, the No. 5 scoring defense and ranks sixth in redzone defense.</p><p>On offense, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2967185/trevor-lawrence/\">Trevor Lawrence</a> has been sacked just three times, which is the fewest of any qualified quarterback. The former No. 1 overall pick has also risen to the challenge of being an underdog as he is 5-2-1 against the spread as an underdog over the last two seasons. He's complemented in the backfield by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2809206/travis-etienne/\">Travis Etienne</a>, whose 6.1 yards per carry lead the NFL as the Jags have the No. 4 rushing offense.

The over has cleared in four of the last five Dodgers games, including three consecutive matchups. Meanwhile, the over has cashed in five of the last 10 outings for Philadelphia. In Game 1, Los Angeles beat Philly 5-3, as they combined for eight total runs. The Dodgers are expected to start right-hander Blake Snell (5-4, 2.35 ERA), while the Phillies will counter with Jesus Luzardo (15-7, 3.92 ERA).

The Jags have also won two consecutive games, as they are 3-1. Thus far in 2025, Jacksonville is 2-0 ATS as the home team and 3-1 ATS in all games.

We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff.\"</p><p>Mark Sanchez and the 69-year-old man, identified as a truck driver, began fighting over a parking situation before the argument turned violent, according to the affidavit. The man stabbed Sanchez in the upper torso around 12:30 a.m. Saturday in downtown Indianapolis near Loughmiller's Pub & Eatery. Sanchez received transportation to Eskenazi Hospital while listed in critical condition. </p>\n<p>The incident escalated near a loading dock where the truck driver said he believed he was in danger and pepper sprayed Sanchez in the face. </p><p>\"I don't care who you are. I don't care what you do for a living. I don't care where you live. If you come into our city and commit violence, we'll use all the tools at our disposal to hold you accountable,\" Indianapolis police chief Chris Bailey said. \"As we move forward, [our] PD will continue to maintain our strong, visible presence in downtown on those high-visibility, high-traffic weekends at major events to make sure our community is safe.

The two-time NFL MVP remains one of the most impactful players in the game today. Mahomes has thrown for at least 26 touchdown passes in each of his seven full seasons as the Chiefs' starter.</p><p>In 2025, Mahomes has gotten off to a solid start with 939 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and just one interception, ranking third in QBR (75.1) through the first month. He's completed 61.3% of his passes while averaging 6.6 yards per attempt, highlighting his strong decision-making and efficiency. He has also rushed for 130 yards and two scores. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-5-jaguars-vs-chiefs-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-monday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_ChiefsJagsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p>\n<p>Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes stacking Mahomes with receiver Xavier Worthy, who was listed as questionable with ankle swelling after the flight to Jacksonville but is active and will play. The former Texas standout entered the NFL as a first-round pick (28th overall) by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2024 after turning heads at the NFL Combine with a blazing 4.21-second 40-yard dash. In his rookie 2024 season, he logged 59 receptions for 638 yards and six receiving touchdowns (plus 104 rushing yards and three rushing scores), showing flashes of big-play potential.</p><p>Through the early 2025 season, Worthy has recorded five catches for 83 yards (16.6 yards per catch), though he's battled injury setbacks including a dislocated shoulder. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> LIX, Xavier Worthy delivered a breakout performance catching eight passes for 157 yards and two touchdowns, setting the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> rookie receiving yardage record in Kansas City's loss. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-week-5-jaguars-vs-chiefs-optimal-fanduel-draftkings-lineups-for-monday-night-football-from-a-daily-fantasy-pro/#ttag=10062025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_mcclure_ChiefsJagsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a>:</p>\n<h2>How to set NFL DFS lineups for Jaguars vs. Chiefs</h2><p>McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football.

However, Demercado dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line.</p><p>The loose football went out of the back of the end zone, making it a touchback for the Titans.</p>\n<p>Naturally, this mind-blowing gaffe drew the ire of all Cardinals supporters -- including coach Jonathan Gannon. Cameras captured Arizona's lead man ripping into Demercado on the sidelines after the play. </p>\n<p>Gannon was asked about this now-viral video on Monday, and he said it was regrettable how he acted. The coach made it known that he apologized to Demercado and all of his players during the team meeting. </p><p>\"Yeah, I woke up this morning and didn't feel great about it, honestly,\" Gannon said. \"So in the team meeting I addressed it. I apologized to Emari, apologized to the team and I just told them I kind of let the moment of what happened get the better of me there. </p><p>\"Obviously, I try to be emotionally stable and calm because my job is to solve problems during a game, and kind of lead the charge on that. So it's not really who I am, who I want to be, and I told the guys that today. So it's a mistake by me and it's just like everybody in there, everybody made some type of mistake yesterday, which culminates to why we didn't win the game, and we can't let it happen moving forward.\" </p>\n<p>The Demercado drop was unfortunately a sign of things to come. The Titans then took the ball and marched 80 yards down the field for their first touchdown in two weeks. Following a Cardinals three-and-out, we then saw <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/titans-turn-cardinals-interception-into-tennessee-touchdown-in-one-of-the-most-wildest-plays-of-the-year/\" target=\"_blank\">a play arguably even more absurd</a></span> than Demercado's disaster.</p><p>Rookie quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> had a pass attempt deflected and intercepted by safety <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3127681/dadrion-taylor-demerson/\">Dadrion Taylor-Demerson</a> around the Cardinals' 5-yard line. However, Taylor-Demerson lost possession of the ball on the ground -- before he was touched -- and it was kicked into the Cardinals end zone. The loose football was then recovered by Titans wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1860834/tyler-lockett/\">Tyler Lockett</a> for a Tennessee touchdown. That miraculous score cut the Cardinals' lead to two points. </p><p>After another Cardinals punt, Ward drove the Titans 71 yards down the field to set up the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116871/joey-slye/\">Joey Slye</a> game-winning field goal. It was a fourth-quarter collapse of epic proportions, and Demercado's fumble unfortunately started the avalanche. </p>\n            </div>",

Kickoff from EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville is at 8:15 p.m. ET. The game features a loaded NFL DFS player pool, with some of the biggest names in the sport like Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Xavier Worthy, Trevor Lawrence, Travis Etienne and Brian Thomas Jr. leading the way. Rashee Rice (suspension) remains sidelined for Kansas City. </p><p>Finding undervalued players at a cheap price is still the key to building a winning NFL DFS strategy in Showdown contests -- especially with this matchup featuring so many big-name players. Should you target potential DFS values like Travis Hunter, Bhayshul Tuten, Kareem Hunt or Isiah Pacheco to pair with the bigger-name players for Monday Night Football DFS lineups and NFL DFS stacks?

He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume.

The former Texas Tech standout remains an elite fantasy asset with one of the highest scoring floors among all NFL quarterbacks. In 2024, he threw for 3,928 yards with 26 touchdowns. </p>\n<p>In 2025, he's off to a strong start with 939 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and just one interception through the early portion of the season, ranking among the most efficient quarterbacks in fantasy scoring. Over his career, Mahomes has earned three Super Bowl titles, three Super Bowl MVPs, two league MVP awards, and multiple First-Team All-Pro and Pro Bowl selections. If he maintains his current efficiency and red-zone production, Mahomes should remain a top-tier QB1 across all fantasy formats. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-chiefs-vs-jaguars-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=10052025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_ChiefsJaguarsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to roster right here</a>.</p><p>Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Jaguars running back Travis Etienne. The former first-round pick out of Clemson is one of the premier all-purpose backs in the NFL. In 2024, he recorded 150 carries for 558 rushing yards and two touchdowns while adding 39 receptions for 254 receiving yards, which was a noticeable dip from his early career production. </p><p>In 2025, he's bounced back with 65 rushing attempts for 394 yards and two touchdowns through the early stretch, averaging over six yards per carry and remaining active in the passing game. Over his career, Etienne has surpassed 1,000 rushing yards in multiple seasons and established himself as one of the NFL's most explosive dual-threat backs. He's also gained at least 73 scrimmage yards in his last two games versus Kansas City, scoring a touchdown in a playoff contest versus the Chiefs. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/insiders/nfl-dfs-picks-chiefs-vs-jaguars-fantasy-lineup-advice-monday-night-football-projections-for-draftkings-fanduel-from-millionaire-maker-contest-winner/#ttag=10052025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_jimmiekaylor_ChiefsJaguarsDFS\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>New users can see the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> to </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>:</em></p><h2>How to build NFL DFS lineups and stacks for Chiefs vs. Jaguars</h2><p>Kaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Monday Night Football.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>FRISCO, Texas -- The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Dallas Cowboys</a>' offense made a subtle yet significant gesture during the end of Sunday's win over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/NYJ/new-york-jets/\">New York Jets</a>. </p><p>On the game's final play, the Cowboys' offensive players stood up in unison before getting back in their proper stance before <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1824864/dak-prescotts/\">Dak Prescott's</a> kneel down that finished off Dallas' second win of the 2025 season. </p><p>For Cowboys fans of a certain age, seeing that likely took them right back to the 1970s, when Tom Landry instructed his offensive line to do the \"Landry Shift\" prior to the snap in an effort to temporarily disrupt the opposing defense's focus and view of Dallas' backfield. </p><p>A day after Dallas' 37-22 win, Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer confirmed that his offense was indeed paying homage to Landry, a Hall of Fame coach who guided the Cowboys to the franchise's first two <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> wins. </p>\n<p>\"I see the pictures every day walking out of my office,\" Schottenheimer said.  \"Literally, there's a cool picture outside my office of Tom Landry on a chalkboard with Roger Staubach. ... That's something that's been around here for a while. All when I took over, it's certainly something we're going to keep because of the tradition. And I'm kind of a dork when it comes to tradition and things like that.\" </p><p>Schottenheimer said the offense ends each Saturday practice by running the \"Landry Shift.\" While he said it took a while for his offensive line to figure it out, they must have done it well enough during this past Saturday's practice for Schottenheimer to feel good enough to have his offense do it at the end of Sunday's win. The head coach singled out fill-in center Brock Hoffman as the player who caused Dallas to \"reload\" or redo the practice reps of the \"Landry Shift\" to make sure they had it right for Sunday with four different offensive line starters because of injuries.</p><p>\"We're the Dallas Cowboys,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I remember those days, and I remember watching pro football and seeing him do it, so it's pretty cool.\" </p>\n<p>An offensive-minded coach, Schottenheimer obviously appreciates the impact Landry's innovative offense had on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>. The \"Landry Shift\" was just one tactic Landry's offense used during a time when pre snap motion was pretty much unheard of. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/panthers-rb-rico-dowdle-warns-cowboys-after-234-yard-performance-buckle-up/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Panthers RB Rico Dowdle warns Cowboys after 234-yard performance: 'Buckle up'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Austin Nivison                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Panthers RB Rico Dowdle warns Cowboys after 234-yard performance: 'Buckle up'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/06/d8310c15-9147-42bc-a9d6-edbf188d85c6/thumbnail/270x152/d84e44dbb3b263c49c701521d4ec0e56/gettyimages-2238340228-2.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Landry's offense used a plethora of pre snap motion and was also one of the first offenses to employ the shotgun on a regular basis. All of this, coupled with having some of the best offensive players in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> history, resulted in the Cowboys having one of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL's</a> best offenses for a significant portion of Landry's time as coach. </p><p>Here's a sampling of some of the damage Landry's offenses did against some legendary NFL defenses: </p>\n<ul><li><strong>1966 NFL Championship:</strong> Scored 27 points and racked up 418 yards against a Vince Lombardi-led <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/GB/green-bay-packers/\">Packers</a> defense that featured six future Hall of Fame players. </li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> VI:</strong> Ran for a then-Super Bowl record 252 yards against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/MIA/miami-dolphins/\">Dolphins</a>' famed \"No Name\" defense. Roger Staubach also threw two touchdowns en route to being named the game's MVP. </li><li><strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> XII: </strong>Scored 27 points against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a>' \"Orange Crush\" defense that included the first touchdown pass in Super Bowl history that was thrown by a non-quarterback. The touchdown pass, thrown by Cowboys running back Robert Newhouse to wideout Golden Richards, sealed Dallas' 27-10 win. </li><li><strong>Super Bowl XIII:</strong> Scored 31 points -- including 14 in the game's final minutes -- against Pittsburgh's \"Steel Curtain\" defense that featured five future Hall of Fame players. In both Super Bowl losses to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PIT/pittsburgh-steelers/\">Steelers</a>, the Cowboys' offense became the only unit to score a first quarter touchdown that season against Pittsburgh's defense. </li></ul><p>In some ways, Dallas' current offense is reminiscent of Landry's offenses during its heyday. </p><p>Like Staubach and Don Meredith before him, Prescott is a poised, confident and accurate passer who can beat a defense in a multitude of ways. Similar to Staubach, who had the luxury of throwing to Drew Pearson and other talented receivers during his career, Prescott also had multiple playmakers at his disposal in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2865251/ceedee-lamb/\">CeeDee Lamb</a> (when healthy) and newcomer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3123212/george-pickens/\">George Pickens</a>. However, he's had to make do without Lamb (ankle sprain) the last couple of weeks. </p><p>While Lamb has carried on Pearson's tradition of great Cowboys wideouts who have worn No. 88, running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2961719/javonte-williams/\">Javonte Williams</a> is donning the same No. 33 that Tony Dorsett and Duane Thomas made synonymous with Cowboys running backs in the 1970s. A former Bronco, Williams has worn the number well during his first season in Dallas as he is currently third in the NFL in rushing. </p>\n<p>While the Cowboys' 2025 season has been a roller coaster so far, the offense has been largely good under Schottenheimer, a longtime NFL offensive coordinator who helped the Jets reach back-to-back AFC Championships in 2009-10. </p><p>\"I like the balance,\" Schottenheimer said when asked about the offense's progress through five weeks. \"I like the ability to, when you're struggling to run the ball a little bit like we were yesterday, it doesn't take much. It takes an explosive, great, well blocked run; Javonte's run at the end of the first half was just incredible. </p><p>\"I like how the ball is being spread around. ... I'm really pleased with the way we're playing up front. That's what we talk about all the time, owning the line of scrimmage. And it's not always going to be perfect when you play in this league because of the elite defenders that you have on the defensive line, but I think it all starts up front there. And then, of course, you know Dak is playing really, really well right now.\" </p>\n            </div>",

The Phillies (96-66), the second seed and NL East champions, are 55-27 on their home field in 2025.

The Phillies have won six of the past nine meetings with the Dodgers. Los Angeles is a -116 favorite on the money line (risk $116 to win $100) in the latest Dodgers vs. Phillies odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, with Philly at -104.

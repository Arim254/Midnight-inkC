However, that also means they aren't making it easy to make 2026 Super Bowl predictions which such a small ATS margin between them.Seattle is favored by 4.5 points (O/U 45.5) per the latest Super Bowl odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, with that NFL spread tied for the largest in the Super Bowl over the last 15 years. Favorites of 4.5 points or more in the Super Bowl are 5-6, straight-up, since 2000. Underdogs have covered 52.6% of the time in Super Bowl history, which is close to the flip of a coin, so that Super Bowl spread trend may not help much with your Seahawks vs. Patriots bets.

For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under on rushing yard, which he locked in at 77.5 (-125).\"New England's run defense is stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop at its current line (70.5) at DraftKings here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (45.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too.

The 40-year-old won his second consecutive gold medal in the parallel giant slalom on Sunday, and he made Winter Olympic history in the process.Karl beat silver medalist Sangkyum Kim's time by 0.19 seconds to defend his title in the parallel giant slalom after taking home gold at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. Karl's win at the age of 40 years and 115 days made him the oldest individual gold medalist in Winter Olympics history.That topped the previous record of 40 years and 12 days, which was set by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen in 2014.\nUpon winning his second consecutive gold medal, Karl did what anyone would do. He ripped off layer after layer of clothing until he was bare-chested in frigid weather, flexed and fell into the snow. Speaking with reporters after the race, Karl said the celebration wasn't as chilly as it appeared.\n\"We have four runs, it was really long, we are sweating full gas -- it's like you're coming out from the sauna,\" Karl said, per the Associated Press. \"I wanted to lay longer in the snow to cool down.\"This gold medal was the fourth Olympic medal of Karl's career. In addition to his two gold medals, Karl won a silver medal in 2010 and a bronze medal in 2014.U.S. notches gold in team figure skating eventHours after Breezy Johnson got the United States on the board with gold in the women's downhill skiing event, Team USA tacked on another gold medal in team figure skating.\nFigure skating phenom Ilia Malinin, 21, sealed the medal with an exhilarating individual performance. With a score of 200.03, Malinin put the United States in first place, but Japan still had a chance to win the even with Shun Sato skating last.\nSato put up an impressive score of 194.86, but it wasn't quite enough to top Malinin and push Japan past the Americans on the podium. For the second consecutive Olympics, the United States has finished first in team figure skating.There will be plenty more opportunities for the U.S. to medal on the ice as the individual events begin on Monday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Super Bowl 60 wasn't the most thrilling game in NFL history, but at least the commercial breaks provided some entertainment as the Seattle Seahawks hammered the New England Patriots, 29-13. Like every Super Bowl, this one had its share of commercial duds, but we're here to talk about the standouts.On the whole, Super Bowl 60 commercials got off to a slow start. The ads during the first quarter elicited more groans and eye rolls than laughs. Fortunately for all of us, the quality picked up in the second quarter, and we got some memorable ones the rest of the way.This year's batch of commercials got the job done in a number of ways. Some leaned on star power and nostalgia, which didn't always work, while others yanked on heart strings to leave an impression.Bosch was a good example of the former category, employing Guy Fieri as you've never seen him before. On the other end of the spectrum, Redfin and Rocket Mortgage simply showed people coming together as a community during trying times. Both commercials cracked the top 10 with room to spare, but they arrived here via different paths.\nWith another round of (very pricy) commercials down, here are the top 10 from Super Bowl 60.10. Dunkin | Good Will Dunkin\nThe de-aging in this one was right out of the uncanny valley, and it very much relied on \"remember this?!\" for comedy. All that said, it was all worth it if the whole thing was a ploy to get Jennifer Aniston to say, \"How about these nuts?\" on national television.9. Bud Light | Keg\nLast year's Bud Light ad featuring the trio of Shane Gillis, Post Malone and Peyton Manning was a bit strong, but this wasn't bad by any means. The trail gag was good, and frankly, the anticipation cracking open the first cold beverage of the wedding reception is practically universal.\n8. T-Mobile | Tell Me Why\nThe Backstreet Boys are back for this Super Bowl 60 commercial. This one was just good fun seeing the reactions of all the customers in the store. The best part might have been Machine Gun Kelly performing for no one at the end.7. Bosch | The More You Bosch\nAs unsettling as it was to see Guy Fieri dressed and styled like a regular joe, it was a good bit, and this commercial was a big step up from the confused ad Bosch ran during Super Bowl 59 featuring a Randy Savage impersonator. The French Bulldog taking on Fieri's signature look was a nice touch.6. Hellmann's | Meal Diamond\nThis commercial felt like a skit that Andy Samberg and John Mulaney would have written during their \"Saturday Night Live\" days. A Neil Diamond impersonator cursed to remain in a deli, and he can only sing about mayo until the curse is broken. It's an off-the-wall premise that Samberg sells very well.\n5. Liquid I.V. | Take A Look\nThis commercial felt like a throwback to a different age of Super Bowl ads in the best way possible. The laughs didn't come from celebrity antics or nostalgia. It was a unique and creative premise that had you wondering where it was going until the very end.4. Budweiser | American Icons\nAn eagle riding a Clydesdale. \"Free Bird\" blaring as the majestic bird takes flight. There are some things that we can all admit are awesome, and two of them were in this commercial.3. Pepsi | The Choice\nA little bit of hatred and rivalry is good on the field. It's also fun to see off the field, which is why this spot from Pepsi ranks among the best of the night. Taking a swing at Coca-Cola and ending it with a reference to the viral Coldplay concert? Well done.\n2. Redfin | America Needs Neighbors Like You\nHeartfelt commercials take the top two spots. That strikes me as unusual, but they were simply a rung above the others. This spot from Redfin and Rocket Mortgage made community the primary focus, and I think that struck a chord with the audience.1. Lay's | Last Harvest\nI wasn't expecting the potato chip company to make the biggest impact of them all, but here we are. The father-daughter relationship worked in this one, and it tugged on the heart strings without overdoing the cheesy factor. This commercial was good enough to warrant consideration in our top 25 of all time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Super Bowl LX has arrived, and by the end of tonight, a new champion will be crowned. This year's matchup features two teams that didn't even make the playoffs last season -- the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks -- each completing an impressive turnaround to reach the NFL's biggest stage.Every year, the Super Bowl stands as the biggest sporting event in the United States, and not just because of the football. The game draws in casual fans and even viewers who rarely watch during the regular season thanks to its iconic performances and viral commercials.We're providing real-time coverage of Super Bowl LX commercials, Bad Bunny's halftime performance, celebrity cameos and more in our Super Bowl entertainment live blog.Before kickoff, several performers will take the field to help set the tone. Charlie Puth will sing the national anthem, Brandi Carlile will perform \"America the Beautiful\" and Coco Jones will deliver \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\"The night's most anticipated performance, however, will come at halftime, when Bad Bunny takes the stage. No special guests have been officially announced, but surprise cameos are always a possibility.\n\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 60 Halftime Show set list predictions: Bad Bunny will perform DtMF, bring up Cardi B and J Balvin\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKickoff for Super Bowl LX is set for 6:30 p.m. ET tonight.

Philadelphia ended up winning that game 40-22. \nWith a halftime score of 9-0, that's one of the lowest scoring totals in a first half in Super Bowl history, but it's not the lowest ever. That record belongs to Super Bowl IX, a game where the Steelers led the Vikings 2-0 at the half before winning 16-6. The Patriots were involved in the second-lowest scoring first half in Super Bowl LIII when they led the Rams just 3-0 at the half of a game that they would win 13-3. This is the fifth lowest-scoring first half in Super Bowl history. This year's game was just the fifth Super Bowl in NFL history to feature zero touchdowns in the first half. Seahawks kicker Jason Myers scored accounted for all nine points with three field goals. \nThe reason the Patriots haven't been able to score is because they can't get anything going on offense. Drake Maye has been facing pressure on almost every play and that's led to three sacks for the Seahawks. Maye has thrown for just 48 yards in the first half and if you toss in the fact that Maye lost 30 yards on his three sacks, that means the team's passing total is at just 18 yards. The Patriots did drive into Seattle territory on each of their first two drives, but they ended up totaling -21 yards on the five plays they ran in Seahawks territory on those two drives. The Patriots totaled just 51 yards in the first half, but that wasn't the lowest total ever because it more than doubled what the Chiefs did last year against the Eagles (23 yards). What the offense struggling, the Patriots will now have to deft history if they want to win their seventh Lombardi Trophy. The could also make history if they don't score because no team has ever been shutout in the Super Bowl. \nIf you want to keep tabs on what happens during the second half of Super Bowl LX, be sure to follow along in our live blog here. \n            \n    ",

What about inviting him to your wedding only for him to turn around and invite you to tie the knot during his Super Bowl 60 halftime performance? That scenario became reality for one lucky couple on Sunday night.Right before Lady Gaga made her surprise guest appearance at Levi's Stadium, an officiant wed two people. That left everyone wondering whether it was real or part of the show. Well, the answer is both.According to NBC Sports, that was a real wedding, and it came about after the couple invited Bad Bunny to their nuptials. Bad Bunny couldn't make it because he was busy performing at the Super Bowl halftime show, but simply brought the wedding to Levi's Stadium.\nIncluding the wedding, Bad Bunny's halftime show was quite the event. In addition to guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, countless celebs could be spotted within the production. Jessica Alba, Pedro Pascal, Karol G and Cardi B were among the A-listers on the set. It was a historic performance, and fans were raving about it when the festivities were over.\nThe performance provided some much-needed energy in the building as the game on the field lacked for fireworks in the first half. The Seattle Seahawks took a 9-0 lead over the New England Patriots into the locker room before Bad Bunny took center stage.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        U.S. men's national team midfielder Weston McKennie scored yet again for Juventus on Sunday, continuing a well-timed career-best goalscoring run ahead of this summer's World Cup in North America.McKennie nabbed Juventus' first goal in a 2-2 draw against Lazio, the goal kicking off his side's comeback with a 59th-minute header that slashed the visitors' lead in half. The play started as Kenan Yildiz made his way into the penalty area but looked to play a pass, spotting Manuel Locatelli making a central run into the box. Before he entered the area, though, Locatelli spotted McKennie in front of him and the American acted quickly to take a shot, but the ball hit an opponent instead.The ball then drifted to McKennie's right and fell to Juventus substitute Edon Zhegrova, who took a shot that was met with a save by Lazio goalkeeper Ivan Provedel. The ball then rolled to the attackers' left, McKennie making a run towards the ball but smartly stopping as it whizzed out of reach. Andrea Cambiaso met up with the ball at the endline instead, McKennie aware of his teammate's movement and taking a few backwards steps before turning towards goal, leaping in the air and flicking the ball into the back of the net with his head, adding style points by kissing it off the post.Watch the goal below.\nMcKennie now has seven goals across all competitions for Juventus this season, officially making it his best goalscoring season in his club career. He scored all of his goals after ex-Italy boss Luciano Spalletti took over as the team's coach in November, Spalletti's tactical preferences paving the way for a new role that has allowed McKennie to flex his attacking skills. He has been a fixture for the new coach as an attack-minded player on the right, though he has the freedom to move centrally and play a large role in Juventus' goalscoring operation, a stylistic change the 27-year-old has seamlessly transitioned to.\nAttacking assignments are not unfamiliar to the versatile McKennie but since joining Juventus at the start of the 2020-21 season, he has been deployed in a wide variety of positions including as a deep-lying midfielder and as a wingback, roles that did not maximize his attacking strengths. Spalletti had a very different impression of McKennie's skillset, one that has benefitted the team and the player in equal measure.\"McKennie is a perfect central striker,\" Spalletti said following last month's statement win over Serie A champions Napoli. \"He fights, he's strong in the air and he can jump high. He plays to get results because he makes decisions. He would be a perfect striker.\"McKennie's current form offers USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino another option to find goals as he attempts to build an attack-minded version of the team in time for next summer's World Cup on home soil. How exactly Pochettino might deploy McKennie is currently a bit of an unknown – the player has been in and out of the national team over the last year, chiefly due to a lack of availability. He was ineligible for last June's Concacaf Gold Cup while competing at the Club World Cup with Juventus and Pochettino left him off the roster for the November friendlies, a 2-1 win against future World Cup group stage opponent Paraguay and a 5-1 win over Uruguay, so he could settle in after Spalletti's hire.\nJuventus currently sit in fourth place, 12 points adrift of Serie A leaders, but in the midst of a competitive battle to qualify for next season's edition of the UEFA Champions League.\n            ",

The award went to Seattle Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III following his performance in a 29-13 win against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX.Walker is the first running back to win the award since former Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis rushed for 157 yards and three touchdowns in Super Bowl XXXII. Davis' performance led the Broncos to a 31-24 upset win over the defending champion Green Bay Packers that snapped the NFC's 13-year winning streak in the big game. He earned MVP honors despite missing nearly the entire second quarter with a migraine.The 25-year-old Walker has joined an exclusive fraternity of running backs that includes six Pro Football Hall of Famers.Running backs who have won Super Bowl MVP ** -- Members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Super BowlPlayerStatsLX (2026)Kenneth Walker, Seahawks27 carries, 135 yards XXXII (1998)**Terrell Davis, Broncos30 carries, 157 yards, 3 TDsXXVIII (1994)**Emmitt Smith, Cowboys30 carries, 132 yards, 2 TDsXXV (1991)Ottis Anderson, Giants21 carries, 102 yards, TDXVIII (1984)**Marcus Allen, Raiders21 carries, 191 yards, 2 TDsXVII (1983)**John Riggins, Washington38 carries, 166 yards, TDIX (1975)**Franco Harris, Steelers34 carries, 158 yards, TDVIII (1974)**Larry Csonka, Dolphins33 carries, 145 yards, 2 TDsThat list does not include former Washington running back Timmy Smith, whose 204 rushing yards in Super Bowl XXII remain the single-game record. It also does not include former Buffalo Bills running back Thurman Thomas, who likely would have won MVP of Super Bowl XXV if Scott Norwood had converted his 47-yard field goal attempt in the game's final seconds. Thomas rushed for 135 yards and a touchdown and totaled 190 all-purpose yards in Buffalo's 20-19 loss to the Giants.\nThe award instead went to the 34-year-old Anderson, a former All-Pro who became the oldest player to win Super Bowl MVP. He remains the oldest non-quarterback to earn the honor.Like the other seven running backs to win Super Bowl MVP, Walker's performance helped lead his team to victory. Walker's 94 rushing yards in the first half was the second-most in Super Bowl history behind only Smith's 131. His runs of 29 and 30 yards on Seattle's fourth drive helped set up Jason Myers' second field goal of the night while extending the Seahawks' lead to 6-0. Walker became the first player in the Super Bowl to record two runs of at least 20 yards on one drive.  \nWhile he was less productive in the second half, his 20-yard catch-and-run on the Seahawks' first drive of the second half set up Myers' fourth field goal. Walker and Myers were complemented by a Seattle defense that dominated the Patriots' offense all night. The Seahawks kept the Patriots off the scoreboard through three quarters and essentially put the game away when Uchenna Nwosu recorded a 45-yard pick-six with 4:27 left. \nThe Seahawks have now won two Super Bowls and evened their overall record in the big game at 2-2. Seattle's win on Sunday night also avenged its last-minute loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks completed their transformation from being a recent NFL afterthought to becoming the 2025 NFL season's Super Bowl champions after a dominating 29-13 Super Bowl LX victory over the AFC champion New England Patriots. The 2025 Seahawks had the longest preseason championship odds (60-1) by a Super Bowl champion since the 2001 Patriots, New England's first Super Bowl title team that also had 60-1 odds. They're also the first team to win the Super Bowl a season after missing the playoffs entirely since the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a franchise that was transformed by the free agency arrival of Tom Brady. Seattle won it all with immaculate play on both sides of the ball: the Seahawks became the first Super Bowl champion ever without a turnover in the postseason, and Seattle's defense became the first to allow no points through three quarters of a Super Bowl since the 1974 \"Steel Curtain\" Pittsburgh Steelers defense. With Super Bowl LX now in the history books and blue and green confetti raining down at Levi's Stadium, let's take a look at some of the key narratives from the Seahawks' dominating victory and figure out if they are overreactions or reality. \nSam Darnold silenced his doubters with turnover-free postseasonOverreaction vs. reality: Reality  When people discussed the Seahawks throughout the 2025 season, it always felt like there was a \"yeah but\" around them because of quarterback Sam Darnold. That was fair given Seattle is his fifth NFL team, and he did lead the 2025 regular season in turnovers with 20, 14 off of interceptions and six off of lost fumbles. However, he silenced all his doubters by playing turnover free football in his three 2025 postseason games. That put him in elite playoff company, joining Drew Brees, Steve Young and Troy Aikman as the only four quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl and have no postseason turnovers in a postseason across the last 35 postseasons. He's also now the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl as a starter after playing for at least five teams.   Darnold's final 2025 playoffs stat line ended up as follows: 61.5% completion percentage (second-best this postseason), 672 pass yards (third-most this postseason), 7.5 yards per pass attempt (third-most this postseason), five passing touchdowns (third-most this postseason), no interceptions and a 102.4 passer rating (second-most this postseason). People can now say the following sentence without a hint of sarcasm, \"You can win a Super Bowl with Sam Darnold as your quarterback.\" \nCornerback Devon Witherspoon is a legitimate starOverreaction vs. reality: RealitySeahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon is just the third defensive back in the past 40 years with a Pro Bowl selection in each of his first three seasons joining Hall of Famer Charles Woodson and 2010s All-Decade Team member Patrick Peterson. He backed up his early career accolades in Super Bowl LX by racking up a sack and two quarterback pressures, including THE key quarterback pressure in the Super Bowl. Edge rusher Uchenna Nwosu's pick six was forced by Witherspoon's pressure, and he took it all the way back for a 45-yard touchdown that put the game out of reach, 29-7, with 4:27 left to play. That gave him a case to be the game's MVP. Witherspoon will continue ascending in head coach Mike Macdonald's defense for years to come. \nJason Myers had the best kicking season ever capped off with Super Bowl history Overreaction vs. reality: Reality  If Seattle Seahawks kicker Jason Myers' five made field goals felt like a lot, it's because they were. His Super Bowl LX performance broke the Super Bowl's all-time, single-game made field goals record as his leg was responsible for all the scoring through the first three quarters of action on Sunday. Myers made the record-breaking kick from 26 yards out to put the Seahawks up 22-7 with 5:35 left to play. He's also become the first player in NFL history to score 200-plus points in a season, including the playoffs.\nMost field goals made in a game, Super Bowl historyMade Field GoalsSEA Jason Myers (2025)5PHI Jake Elliott (2024)4KC Harrison Butker (2023)4SF Ray Wersching (1981) 4GB Don Chandler (1967)4Edge rusher Derick Hall is a rising starOverreaction vs. reality: Overreaction  Seattle Seahawks edge rusher Derick Hall, a 2023 second-round pick out of Auburn, registered one of the best defensive performances in Super Bowl history. He became the 10th player with multiple sacks and a forced fumble in a Super Bowl since sacks became an officially tracked sack in 1982, per CBS Sports Research. His strip-sack helped set up the Seahawks' first touchdown of the game, a 16-yard play-action pass from Darnold to tight end AJ Barner. Milton Williams, a current New England Patriot, achieved the feat with the Philadelphia Eagles in their 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX last season. However, this performance is an outlier for Hall, who had just two sacks in the entire 2025 season after playing in 14 games and only starting three of them. However, this performance likely gives the Seahawks enough confidence to let edge rusher Boye Mafe walk in free agency and empower him to start down the road with DeMarcus Lawrence (33 years old) getting up there, relatively speaking for NFL edge rushers. \nWill Campbell needs to move inside to guard if he's to have a long NFL careerOverreaction vs. reality: Reality  New England Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, the fourth overall pick of the 2025 NFL Draft, experienced a rude awakening this postseason. His four sacks allowed, including one in Super Bowl LX, and his 12 quarterback pressures allowed were both the most this postseason. That's on top of six sacks allowed in the regular season in 13 games played, that's nearly a sack every other game. Some were worried about Campbell and his wingspan when he came out of the draft this spring, and he's proved those doubters right. Campbell, who is listed at 6-6, 319 pounds, was measured as having 32 5/8\" arms at the NFL Scouting Combine. Offensive tackles with longer arms have a better opportunity to prevent edge rushers from plowing into their chest because of better reachPatriots 2010s All-Decade Team left guard Logan Mankins' arm length was 33 3/8\" -- longer than Campbell's. Just like Campbell at LSU, Mankins was a left tackle at Fresno State. However, he moved inside to guard in the NFL. Campbell would be better served to protect Maye if doing so from the interior. Maye's 21 sacks this postseason are the most in a single postseason, and his seven fumbles are tied for the most in a single postseason. He was sacked at least five times in all four of New England's playoff games, which makes Maye tied for the third-most five-sack games in a career after just his first playoff run. Campbell's inability to protect his blindside played a major role in that statistic. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Drake Maye's storybook sophomore season did not feature a storybook ending.Instead of capping off his breakout year with a Lombardi Trophy in hand, Maye walked off the field in noticeable agony as Seattle Seahawks-themed confetti rained down around him following a 29-13 thumping at Levi's Stadium in Super Bowl LX.Minutes after the clock hit zero, a glassy-eyed Maye stepped to the postgame podium to explain what went wrong with an offense that was shut out for the first three quarters -- something that hadn't happened in a Super Bowl since the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII (1973 season).\"It's going to hurt and sting for a while,\" Maye said, \"but that's what you sign up for.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking worst Super Bowls of all time: Where Patriots-Seahawks rematch falls among bottom 10\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMaye completed 27 of 43 pass attempts in Super Bowl LX for 295 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. However, the bulk of that production came in garbage time as New England desperately tried to claw back into the contest. Excluding the final frame, Maye was 8 of 18 (44.4%) for 60 yards.\"Yeah, I think there are plays that I'll think about for the next probably seven months until we're back in September playing the first one,\" he said, reliving the worst defeat of his young career moments after it happened.\nWhen Maye and the Patriots finally found a spark in the fourth quarter -- scoring their first touchdown on a 35-yard pass to Mack Hollins -- they couldn't sustain the momentum. After New England's defense forced a Seahawks punt, Maye and the offense had an opportunity to cut the deficit to within a touchdown with just over 10 minutes to play.\nInstead, Maye threw interceptions on the next two possessions, including a pick-six.\n\"Those plays that can change the game matter,\" Maye said. \"If you make them, you're celebrating. If not, you're sitting here, you know, crying at a podium. That's part of it. I know the postseason is what you play for, and I know we'll be back -- we'll be back in the postseason.\"The postseason proved to be a different animal for Maye and the Patriots. Throughout the regular season, the young quarterback was superb, putting himself in the MVP conversation after leading the league in completion percentage, passer rating and yards per attempt. In the playoffs, those numbers dipped considerably, most notably with his completion rate falling to 58.3%.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports HQ\n                                                            Part of that decline could be attributed to Maye not being 100% healthy, as he had been nursing a right shoulder injury entering the Super Bowl. Maye told reporters that \"we shot it up\" before the game to make it more manageable, but added that he doesn't believe the injury affected his performance.\"I think it would be hard to say that,\" he said when asked if his shoulder limited him. \"It feels good enough to be out there. ... Just didn't make plays tonight.\"Maye was clearly crushed by the loss, especially given his role in the defeat with subpar play on the game's biggest stage. Still, he was quick to frame the moment as fuel to get New England back to the postseason -- and next time, finish the job.\n\"The losses, they hurt,\" he said. \"I think you try to learn when you win and remember this feeling when you lose. I know there's a lot of things that you wish you had back, but it will only make you stronger in the end.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If there's one thing NFL coaches talk about all the time, it's the fact that you have to win all three phases of the game if you want to win in the NFL and that includes special teams. No one understands that message more than the Seattle Seahawks, who pulled off one of the most dominant special teams performances in NFL postseason history on Sunday night during their 29-13 win over the New England Patriots. When it comes to special teams, the Seahawks put their money where their mouth is: When it comes to the kicker and punter positions, the Seahawks spent more money than any other team in the NFL this year and their investments paid off big time in Super Bowl LX. Jason Myers played so well that he you could argue that he should have been voted MVP of the game. The Seahawks kicker, who scored 17 of Seattle's 29 points, set a Super Bowl record with five field goals. In a blowout win, it might seem like the kicks weren't very big, but with points at a premium, the Seahawks needed every point they could get and Myers came through every time Seattle called upon him. He opened the scoring of the game in the first quarter with a 33-yard field goal that gave Seahawks a 3-0 lead and they would never trail after that. \nNot only did Myers hit from 33, but he also hit from 26, 39 along with two kicks from 41 yards away. Those might not sound like challenging kicks, but every kick in the Super Bowl is a challenge. Going into Super Bowl LX, kickers had hit just 84.9% of their field goals in the big game from 41 yards and in, so hitting 100% was certainly an achievement. And let's not forget, Myers' 5-for-5 performance came at Levi's Stadium, a venue that caused nightmares for kickers in 2025. During the regular season, visiting kickers hit just 10 of 16 field goals and that 62.5% hit rate was the lowest percentage by visiting kickers at any stadium this year.Myers has been a not-so-secret weapon for Seattle all year. During the regular season, he hit 41 field goals while also leading the NFL in points with 171. If you throw in his postseason numbers, Myers ended scoring 204 points on the season, making him the first PLAYER in NFL history to score 200 points in a single season (We've got more on that here). \nThe Seahawks signed Myers in 2019, and since then, he's been a home run for them. The team loves him so much that they made him one of the highest-paid kickers in the NFL back in 2023 when they signed him to a four-year, $21.1 million extension. His average annual value of $5.275 million makes him the eighth-highest-paid kicker in the league. Seahawks general manager John Schneider knows the importance of special teams, which is why he also has a punter who just happens to be the highest-paid guy at his position in the NFL. Michael Dickson, who makes an average of $4.05 million per year, is the only player on Seattle's entire roster who is the highest-paid player at his position. And on Sunday night, Dickson showed why he's the highest-paid punter in the NFL. The Australian phenom punted seven times against New England, and on three of those punts, he pinned the Patriots inside their own 6-yard line. It's impressive when a punter can pin an opponent inside its own 20, it's spectacular when they can pin an opponent inside its own 10, but pinning an opponent inside its own 6-yard line THREE times in the SUPER BOWL? That's pretty much unheard of. \nHis best punt came in the fourth quarter: With the Seahawks leading 19-7, the Patriots were looking to sneak back into the game, but Dickson shut the door on that with a 55-yard punt that pinned the Patriots on their own 4-yard line. \nWith a bad punt there, that could have set the Patriots up with good field position. At that point, the score was 19-7, so if New England drives down and get a touchdown, it's suddenly 19-14. However, the Seahawks' defense took over after Dickson's punt and forced an interception. During his college career at Texas, Dickson was the MVP of a bowl game -- seriously -- and you could certainly argue that he derved an MVP vote or two in this game. \nBetween Dickson and Myers, the Seahawks are spending an average of $9.325 million per year on the two of them, which makes them the ONLY team in the NFL that spends more than $9 million per year on their kicker and punter combined. The salary cap is expected to top $300 million this year for the first time ever, but teams still aren't investing in their specialists. The Seahawks clearly take their special teams seriously and they have the receipts to prove it. Since the NFL is a copycat league, it's possible that teams might start spending more money on both their kicker and punter (Most teams will pay one or the other, but not both). The Seahawks win also means that someone in the Harbaugh family will have bragging rights this offseason: Jay Harbaugh. In his second season as Seattle's special teams coordinator, the son of Jim Harbaugh earned a Super Bowl ring that has eluded his dad. \nThe Seahawks are a special team and one big reason for that is because they truly understand the importance of special teams. And that's a big reason why they just won their second Lombardi Trophy in franchise history. \n            ",

The 60th edition of the big game took place at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It was second Super Bowl played at the stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, and the third played in the San Francisco Bay area.The last Super Bowl played at Levi's Stadium was Super Bowl 50 exactly 10 years ago, when the Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers, 24-10. Next season the Super Bowl will once again be in California, but in the Los Angeles area at Inglewood's SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams. The game will take place on Valentine's Day, Sunday, Feb. 14, over Presidents' Day weekend.The Super Bowl has taken place in numerous cities and stadiums in its 60-year history and any area who wants to host must submit a proposal years in advance. The NFL owners vote on the city they want to select a few years before the game is scheduled. For instance, the 2028 game has already been awarded to Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. In the beginning of the game's existence, the process was not as democratic or transparent. \nOf all states, Florida has hosted the most Super Bowls at 17, followed by California at 12 and Louisiana at 11. \n        \n            \n                Super Bowl 2026: Can the Patriots protect Drake Maye well enough to beat Sam Darnold and Seattle?\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe two cities to host the most Super Bowls are Miami, Florida, and New Orleans, Louisiana, which both hosting 11. Super Bowl 59 in 2025 at the Caesars Superdome marked New Orleans' 11th time hosting. The 2020 Super Bowl at Hard Rock Stadium was Miami's 11th time hosting.Warm weather and domed stadiums are preferred, but there has been an outlier. Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey was the first outdoor \"cold-weather\" championship, although the 49-degree kickoff was relatively mild for the Northeast. There has not been a outdoor \"cold-weather\" venue selected since, however, the game has visited domed stadiums in Detroit, Indianapolis and Minneapolis. \nHere's a look at where every Super Bowl has taken place, along with the matchup and winner:Super BowlYearDateLocationMatchup (winner in bold)LXII2028TBDMercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GeorgiaTBDLXI2027Feb 14SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, CaliforniaTBDLX2026Feb 8Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CaliforniaSeahawks 29, Patriots 13LIX2025Feb 9Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana Eagles vs. ChiefsLVIII2024Feb 11Allegiant Stadium, Paradise, Las Vegas, NevadaChiefs vs. 49ersLVII2023Feb 12State Farm Stadium, Glendale, ArizonaChiefs vs. EaglesLVI2022Feb 13SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, CaliforniaRams vs. BengalsLV2021Feb 7Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, FloridaBuccaneers vs. 49ers LIV2020Feb 2Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, FloridaChiefs vs. 49ersLIII2019Feb 3Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GeorgiaPatriots vs. RamsLII2018Feb 4U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, MinnesotaEagles vs. PatriotsLI2017Feb 5NRG Stadium, Houston, TexasPatriots vs. FalconsL2016Feb 7Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CaliforniaBroncos vs. PanthersXLIX2015Feb 1State Farm Stadium, Phoenix, ArizonaPatriots vs. SeahawksXLVIII2014Feb 2MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New JerseySeahawks vs. BroncosXLVII2013Feb 3Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, LouisianaRavens vs. 49ersXLVI2012Feb 5Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, IndianaGiants vs. PatriotsXLV2011Feb 6AT&T Stadium, Arlington, TexasPackers vs. SteelersXLIV2010Feb 7Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, FloridaSaints vs. ColtsXLIII2009Feb 1Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, FloridaSteelers vs. CardinalsXLII2008Feb 3State Farm Stadium, Phoenix, ArizonaGiants vs. PatriotsXLI2007Feb 4Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, FloridaColts vs. BearsXL2006Feb 5Ford Field, Detroit, MichiganSteelers vs. SeahawksXXXIX2005Feb 6Alltel Stadium, Jacksonville, FloridaPatriots vs. EaglesXXXVIII2004Feb 1NRG Stadium, Houston, TexasPatriots vs. PanthersXXXVII2003Jan 26Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, CaliforniaBuccaneers vs. RaidersXXXVI2002Feb 3Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, LouisianaPatriots vs. RamsXXXV2001Jan 28Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, FloridaRavens vs. GiantsXXXIV2000Jan 30Georgia Dome, Atlanta, GeorgiaRams vs. TitansXXXIII1999Jan 31Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, FloridaBroncos vs. FalconsXXXII1998Jan 25Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego, CaliforniaBroncos vs. PackersXXXI1997Jan 26Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, LouisianaPackers vs. PatriotsXXX1996Jan 28Sun Devil Stadium, Tempe, Phoenix, ArizonaCowboys vs. SteelersXXIX1995Jan 29Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, Florida49ers vs. ChargersXXVIII1994Jan 30Georgia Dome, Atlanta, GeorgiaCowboys vs. BillsXXVII1993Jan 31Rose Bowl, Pasadena, CaliforniaCowboys vs. BillsXXVI1992Jan 26Hubert H.

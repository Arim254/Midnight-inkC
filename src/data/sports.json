    "body": "\n        Florida State freshman Ethan Pritchard is on his way home for the first time since an Aug. 31 shooting left him critically injured. The Seminoles linebacker was released from a rehabilitation facility in Jacksonville on Thursday, marking another milestone in his recovery from the incident. He had been in rehab for over a month following his Oct. 9 release from Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.Pritchard gave his first interview since the shooting and reflected on the incident and his road to recovery. He said he remembers everything that occurred leading up to the shooting and that his ultimate goal is to return to the football field.\"It started off with me waking [my father] up at 1:30 in the morning just moving my arm,\" Pritchard said of his recovery. \"When I first got here, I couldn't even move my whole right side. It started off with that, and then after that, it just got better and better.\"\nOne day after Florida State's season-opening win over Alabama, Pritchard was shot in the back of the head in what law enforcement said was a case of mistaken identity. The incident occurred in Havana, Florida, while Pritchard was driving family members home from a gathering. Pritchard said he heard shots ring out and put the car in reverse before blacking out.Authorities arrested four suspects in connection with the shooting. Three men -- Jayden Bodison, Caron Miller and Germany Atkins -- and an unnamed minor face three counts of attempted murder and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Atkins was also charged with a count of probation violation.\nFlorida State players and coaches visited Pritchard during his hospital stay, and when he was released, they gathered at the facility to cheer him on as he departed for the rehab center. Seminoles coach Mike Norvell paid a visit earlier on, just after Pritchard opened his eyes for the first time.\"It was something that was emotional for everybody, to be honest with you,\" Norvell said. \"It's still a long part of the progress in this process moving forward, but it puts all things in perspective -- the appreciation of a blink.\"Florida State honored Pritchard, a true freshman and three-star recruit in the 2025 class, at its first game following the incident. The linebackers' teammates carried his jersey to midfield for the coin toss, among other tributes.\nPritchard, a Sanford Seminole product, was a longtime Florida State recruiting target and signed with the program over offers from a number of Power Four programs including perennial College Football Playoff contenders such as Miami, Notre Dame and Tennessee. He suited up for the season opener against Alabama but did not play any snaps.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys coaches and players took another significant step in their grieving process following 24-year-old edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland's Nov. 6 death by a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Thursday: returning to practice as a team. However, the emotions are still raw. Dallas wide receiver Ryan Flournoy, a 2024 sixth-round pick who entered the league with Kneeland being the second round pick of their draft class, was shocked when he first saw the news. The two draft classmates became incredibly close with Flournoy as he and his wife Kalei went on double dates with Kneeland and his girlfriend Catalina Mancera.\"It was shocking, honestly. The bye week everybody [at] home just waking up and hearing that news is shocking, honestly. A lot of y'all know me and Marshawn came in together as rookies. So my wife and his girl became close. We went on double dates,\" Flournoy said on Thursday. \"I'm just thinking 'man,[all the] times we went on double dates, I just wish I would have told him you got to wait on God no matter how hard life gets. Just turn to God because I'm a witness.' I've read it in the Bible, and I've witnessed it in [my] life. May he rest in peace. All I could do is just pray for him for sure.\"Cowboys defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa spent the last two seasons with Kneeland every single day in the defensive line position room for meetings and as a unit in practice the last two years. Odighizuwa and fellow defensive tackle Solomon Thomas were the two Dallas teammates who spoke at the candlelight vigil the team held at The Ford Center, Dallas' indoor practice facility, on Tuesday night. He's also still processing \"a wave of shock\" having to talk about the death of his \"little bro.\"\n\"It was definitely just shocking. It was like being hit with a wave of shock and then just heaviness in my heart. Back to the shock, and being like 'damn,'\" Odighizuwa said on Thursday. \"It meant a lot to have the honor of speaking on his behalf at the vigil. That was my little bro. I love Marshawn. Being able to do that, it was tough, but it was definitely an honor.\"Odighizuwa, a fifth-year veteran who re-signed with the Cowboys on a four-year, $80 million contract extension this past offseason, grew tight with Kneeland after the 24-year-old showcased an admirable work ethic and drive to hone his craft. \"I just always encouraged Marshawn like I do with all the rookies. I feel like he was someone that was receptive to stuff like that. In terms of knowing the playbook and stuff like that, that was something that stuck out to me. When he came in and was being a sponge, wanting to learn, 'What do you do for your body?'... 'What do you do in the offseason? Is there anything that helps you a little extra?' Just trying to find out stuff like that,\" Odighizuwa said. \"Slowly, but surely, he would open up to me a little bit. One of his people after the vigil told me how secluded he is, doesn't say too much, very private guy. If he opened up to you, it means he loved you.\"\nDealing with Kneeland's death is especially shocking considering the 24-year-old scored the first touchdown of his career in the Cowboys' last game played with a fumble return touchdown off of a blocked punt against the Arizona Cardinals. Flournoy was on the field with him, recalling how shocking it was to see Kneeland beat players like himself, who play wide receiver, to the football in that moment. \"It's crazy. You could be high off life, and you just scored a NFL touchdown, which a lot of people don't do, and then be gone a couple days later,\" Flournoy said. \"I remember him scoring. I remember the play. Me and [edge rusher] Sam [Williams] got back there. Sam blocked the punt, and I remember racing to the ball. I'm seeing Marshawn running like a 4.2 [40-yard dash], I'm like 'dang.' He beat me to the ball and got the touchdown. We [were] all cheering because as special teams [players] we need that. Special teams and special players, and  he was a special player. It was just cool to see him get that moment. It's sad to see him go.\"\nDallas returns to practice, honoring Kneeland with how the Cowboys playDespite the Cowboys organization still mourning the loss of Kneeland, Dallas has to return to play and prepare for their Week 11 matchup at the Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\" Thursday marked the first return to practice for the team as a whole.\n\"We had good energy this morning in the meetings. The meetings were very productive, and like I said yesterday, we're ready to get this week under way and put our best foot forward and get ready to honor Marshawn,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said Thursday.The two Cowboys who have lost siblings to suicide, quarterback Dak Prescott (his brother Jace in 2020) and defensive tackle Solomon Thomas (his sister Ella in 2018) have been crucial in helping their teammates process through their grief. One of Thomas' main messages to his teammates has been that it's OK to not feel normal because dealing with this type of loss isn't normal. One of Prescott's main themes he's shared with teammates has been how key it is to express feelings and not go through the grieving process alone. The Cowboys quarterback also said going through this with his teammates is driving him to invest more personally into relationships with teammates to make sure they all become more than a jersey number. \"Obviously me and Solly have been through this, but I'll be the first to say, I may be the champion of speaking up but I'm not necessarily the champion of dealing with grief, I guess you can say. I can say I'm a champion of moving forward and past it and using it as your source of strength,\" Prescott said on Thursday. ... \"I get angry a lot. The best way is when I get angry or I get sad in those moments, I think about 'how can I counteract that?' Usually, it's 'how can I make somebody smile or how can I do something better?' So just little things like that have been helpful. I know they've been helpful to me. ... I've taken a lot from those conversations from O2X, from Doctor T [team psychologist Dr. Heather Twedel], from the professionals and have brought them into smaller conversations as we've had breakouts or just hot tub talk or conversations at lunch. It's just the more we can talk, the more we can connect, that's the only good in this honestly at this moment. Reminds us how important it is to not just know these jersey numbers, but to know the family and to know things beyond this building.\"   \nThe sentiment that returning to practice on Thursday was helpful was unanimous around the Cowboys locker room, and there was a feeling that the practice was quite productive. \"It was great. Schotty alluded to that. He said it earlier in the week, 'some guys are going to get out on the field, and it's going to hurt. Some guys are going to get out there, and it's going to be the best medicine for them.' Having dealt with loss, that is the best medicine for me,\" Prescott said. \"So getting back out there, handing the ball off and sprinting an extra 10 yards and making sure I'm doing it hard, Marshawn went through my mind a few times at practice today. I just countered that with running harder after a play, or trying to do something to better this team to show that. It felt good. I know it was a great practice. A lot of guys were out there, good energy, beautiful weather. As I said, we're not forgetting, but we're moving forward carrying on the light.\"\nOdighizuwa concurred, finding some solace in the normalcy that practice brings. \n\"Helpful for me personally. I feel like, one, I'm kind of a busy body, so being able to move around helps get some sort of normalcy back,\" Odighizuwa said. Now, Dallas will do everything they can to honor Kneeland through the play on the field on top of the efforts made through putting on a helmet decal, wearing shirts pregame and donating to the Marshawn Kneeland Memorial Fund to support Mancera and her unborn child with Kneeland. \"That grieving process is not over. There's going to be things that affect us differently throughout the next couple weeks, but we understand our best way to honor Marshawn on the field is how we play,\" Schottenheimer said. \"That's something we get to control, and I think the guys are excited about that.\"\nSo what does playing for Kneeland look like? Being relentless. \"Relentless. Marshawn did everything 110%. That's on and off the field,\" Odighizuwa said. \"With the people that he loved, the emotions that he felt, and that translates to the way he played. Everything was 110%.\"Prescott recalled Kneeland routinely making Schottenheimer's highlight reels of players hustling during offseason program practices, so that's the type of hustle Dallas will be looking to emulate. \"Nobody chased the ball like Marshawn. You turn on practice film, game film, whatever it may be. I know going back to the spring Schotty would show clips of guys running to the ball at OTAs, and Marshawn always made that list,\" Prescott said. \"I think it's evident right there. I think that showed his love for the game, showed his love for his teammates and that this meant. At any position I think that's an easy way to do it right there. ... Chasing the ball down just as Marshawn would.\"\nPlaying that way more consistently could perhaps incrementally elevate Dallas' 31st-ranked scoring defense that is allowing 30.8 points per game, the third-most through nine games of a season in Cowboys history. \"If we all play like Marshawn, we'll play like a better team. I'm not saying Marshawn was a perfect player, but that way he would go out there and play is the way football is supposed to be played. ... No matter how tired he was, he would play with intensity and tenacity,\" defensive tackle Solomon Thomas said Thursday. ... \"He played with love. He played every play like it was his last and didn't take reps for granted. What I learned is he came from a small town in Michigan and he wasn't supposed to be here. So he played like he wanted to be here every single day. If we do that, we'll honor him -- win, loss or draw -- if we play like Marshawn. We'll be a better team. We'll come out of this better.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nIf the Dallas Cowboys want to keep alive their chances to avoid missing the playoffs for a second straight year, they're first going to have to win a vast majority of their eight remaining games. That must begin in Week 11 of the 2025 NFL season, when they visit the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday Night Football.The Cowboys (3-5-1), who were on a bye last week, have lost three of their last four games and have yet to post back-to-back victories this season. The fell to 1-4 on the road with a 44-24 setback against the Denver Broncos in Week 8 and dropped a 17-17 decision to the Arizona Cardinals at home the following week.Dallas currently is 11th in the NFC but can jump ahead of Minnesota this week with a triumph over Las Vegas and a Vikings loss to the Chicago Bears. But the Cowboys still will have two teams standing between them and the third wild card spot in the conference, and things will get much more difficult for them as they face the Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions in their next three games.\nHowever, Dallas first must focus on its meeting with a Raiders team that has struggled mightily in Pete Carroll's return to the head-coaching ranks. Las Vegas has lost three consecutive contests and seven of eight since defeating the New England Patriots on the road in its season opener.Dallas' offense is among the most productive in the NFL as the team ranks third in passing (257.8 yards) and fourth in both scoring (29.2 points) and total offense (378.4 yards). But for the Cowboys to have a legitimate shot at the postseason, they'll have to improve dramatically on the other side of the ball as they are 28th against the run (143.0 yards allowed), 29th against the pass (254.4) and 31st in total defense (397.4) and points allowed (30.8).SportsLine's Inside the Lines team currently doesn't give Dallas much of a chance to qualify for the playoffs, and the team's outlook improves minimally with a victory against Las Vegas. However, the Cowboys' prospects become almost obsolete with a third consecutive defeat.According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the Raiders have no chance to avoid missing the postseason for the fourth straight year and eighth time in nine campaigns. A win on Monday night would do virtually nothing to improve their outlook.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 11 WINWITH WEEK 11 LOSSDIFFERENCEDallas Cowboys7.9%10.7%2.8%7.9%Las Vegas Raiders0.0%0.1%0.0%0.1%Winning their second NFC East title in three years doesn't appear to be in the cards for the Cowboys, as the Eagles are soaring to their second straight crown with a 7-2 record. Three of Philadelphia's next four games are against bona  fide playoff contenders in the Lions, Bears and Los Angeles Chargers, so the slimmest of chances are there for Dallas, which also faces the Eagles in that span -- should the reigning Super Bowl champion lose those contests.The model currently gives the Cowboys less than a 2% chance to win the division and says a win on Monday night barely moves the needle regarding their outlook. Meanwhile, a loss would all but put them out of contention.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC EASTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 11 WINWITH WEEK 11 LOSSDIFFERENCEDallas Cowboys1.8%2.5%0.6%1.9%Philadelphia Eagles97.7%98.9%96.3%2.6%Washington Commanders0.5%0.9%0.2%0.7%New York Giants0.0%0.0%0.0%0.0%The model gives the Raiders no consideration when it comes to finishing atop the AFC West, a division in which the other three members all are above the .500 mark. Most of Las Vegas' problems are on the offensive side of the football, as the team is 27th in passing (185.2 yards), 29th in rushing (87.4), 30th in total offense (272.7 yards) and 31st in scoring (15.4 points). In addition, Geno Smith is tied for second in the NFL with 12 interceptions.Las Vegas is in the middle of the pack in most defensive categories, but it will have to be close to its best on Monday. Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott is sixth in the league with 2,319 passing yards and seventh with 17 touchdown tosses, running back Javonte Williams ranks third with eight TD runs and sixth with 716 rushing yards, and wideout George Pickens is fourth in both receiving yards (764) and scoring catches (six). Tight end Jake Ferguson also has hauled in six touchdown passes, and CeeDee Lamb has 491 yards in just five full games played.One of the few offensive bright spots for the Raiders has been the play of running back Ashton Jeanty, who was the sixth overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The 21-year-old rookie is 10th in the league in rushing with 547 yards and has made four TD runs, including Las Vegas' lone score in last week's 10-7 loss to the AFC West-rival Broncos.The Cowboys are 3.5-point favorites against the Raiders in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 28-22 victory for Dallas, which would keep the team in the mix for a playoff spot in the NFC every so slightly.\n            ",

Among the biggest are Sunday, when the AFC West co-leading Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams face off as Sam Darnold looks to guide the Seahawks past Matthew Stafford and the Rams. Anothr key divisional matchup features the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Denver Broncos in a pivotal AFC West meeting. The Rams are 3-point favorites as both they and the Seahawks sport 7-2 ATS records, while Kansas City is favored by 3.5 points on the road.A non-divisional matchup with heavy NFC playoff race implications features the Detroit Lions against the Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5). Philadelphia has won the last two meetings, the last a 38-35 triumph in 2022. The largest Sunday spread has the Ravens (-7.5) over the Cleveland Browns despite uncertainty surrounding Lamar Jackson, who missed practice with a knee injury on Wednesday. Other big favorites include the Packers (-7) vs. the Giants, as Jameis Winston will start in place of Jaxson Dart (concussion) and the Texans (-6) vs. Titans, in which a concussion will also keep C.J.

Yuracheck will replace former chairman Mack Rhoades, who stepped away from his role on Thursday. Utah athletic director Mark Harlan will also rejoin the selection committee after previously serving a one-year term during the 2023 season. This change comes just two days after the CFP unveiled its second set of rankings and less than a month before the final 12-team playoff field is unveiled on Dec. 7.\"We are deeply appreciative of Mack Rhoades' leadership and service as Chair of the College Football Playoff Selection Committee this season,\" College Football Playoff executive director Rich Clark said in a statement. \"Mack has informed us of his decision to step down for personal reasons, and our thoughts are with him and his family during this time. \"We are pleased to announce that Hunter Yurachek will assume the role of Selection Committee Chair, effective immediately. Hunter's experience, integrity, and commitment to the game make him exceptionally well-suited to lead the committee as it continues its important work throughout the remainder of the season.\"\nYurachek has served as an athletic director for 15 years and has been at Arkansas since 2017. He also had stints directing the athletic departments at Coastal Carolina (2010-15) and Houston (2015-17). Yurachek has presided over two coaching changes during his time at Arkansas. He hired former boss Sam Pittman in 2020 to replace Chad Morris and then fired Pittman midway through the 2025 season. The Razorbacks are actively searching for a new coach. \nHarlan, meanwhile, has been at Utah since 2018 after a six-year stint as the athletic director at South Florida.   \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        New York Knicks star guard Jalen Brunson is expected to miss Friday night's matchup against the Miami Heat with a Grade 1 right ankle sprain, per ESPN. The injury isn't serious, as he'll be evaluated on a day-to-day basis, which is a huge sigh of relief for the Knicks.Brunson sustained the injury in the closing minutes of New York's 124-107 loss to the Orlando Magic Wednesday night. With 1:54 left in the fourth quarter Brunson was attacking the rim, and as he attempted to plant his foot to elevate off the floor he landed on the foot of Orlando big man Wendell Carter Jr. Brunson popped up quickly and shot both of his free throws, though he had a considerable limp. After converting one of the two shots from the line, Brunson intentionally fouled Jalen Suggs to get out of the game, and immediately walked to the Knicks' locker room without going to the bench.Here's where the injury occurred:\nAfter the game, Knicks coach Mike Brown said he didn't know anything other than Brunson turned his right ankle on the play. The All-Star guard was seen exiting Madison Square Garden in a walking boot with crutches following the loss. It's the same ankle Brunson injured last season that forced him to miss 15 games, but it sounds as though this situation is nowhere near that severe.Brunson's status is a positive outcome after an embarrassing loss to the Magic. Brunson was still in the game despite the game decidedly out of reach, which may raise questions about why he was still out there in the first place. If this injury was more severe that would certainly be a bigger plot point, but the good thing is that becomes a moot point with him not expected to miss much time.\nA rejuvenated offenseKnowing Brunson isn't going to miss a ton of time also ensures the Knicks can keep building on the momentum they've built over the last six games. Before that stinker against the Magic, the Knicks were on a five-game winning streak. They have the second-best offense in the league, implementing Brown's new system that has the Knicks taking the third-most 3s in the league. That's a massive change from New York ranking 27th in that same category a season ago, but it's contributed to the Knicks' success so far.It took some time for everyone to adjust, which contributed to the 2-3 record New York started the season with, but over the last batch of games things have been clicking offensively. They're not just taking more 3s, this new system has also taken the ball out of Brunson's hands slightly. In the past, the Knicks ran a ton of isolation plays for their lead guard to great success. Brunson dominated the ball, and while that's still the case, we've seen a slight decrease so far this season.\nSeasonTime of possession (seconds)Isolation frequency2025-267.811.7%2024-258.617.3%2023-248.615.1%2022-238.513.2%The Knicks have been humming along with this new system, and can continue to do so knowing that Brunson won't be sidelined for too long. If there's one adjustment the Knicks need to make, though, it's getting more production out of their second unit.The Knicks' bench unit has been a weakness in what's been an otherwise strong start. That second unit ranks 25th in scoring, and as the grind of the season picks up, they'll need guys like Josh Hart and Jordan Clarkson to produce more.Hart's production has taken a step back this season, and while he's never been a high volume 3-point shooter he's certainly been more efficient inside the arc. After averaging 13.6 points a season ago, he's managing just 8.4 points on 44.4% from the floor. Clarkson was brought in this summer to give the Knicks more scoring depth off the bench, but so far he's been streaky. He's a former Sixth Man of the Year, and is certainly capable of putting up 20 points on some nights. Both guys may just be adjusting -- and Hart did enter the regular season banged up -- but come April and May the Knicks are going to need those guys to give more than what they've been showing so far.But we haven't even reached the one-month mark on the season, so these are minor issues. The positive is that the Knicks don't have to figure out how to carry on without Brunson for an extended period of time, and this top-tier offense they've been operating with can continue to build chemistry as New York tries to establish itself as the team to beat in the Eastern Conference.\n            ",

On Thursday night, Ohtani won National League MVP, beating out fellow finalists Kyle Schwarber (Philadelphia Phillies) and Juan Soto (New York Mets). By sweeping all 30 first-place votes, Ohtani was a unanimous selection for the award.

He is the second player in history with four career MVP awards, joining Barry Bonds, who won a record seven. Bonds (2001-04) is the only other player to win three MVPs consecutively.Last year, Ohtani joined Hall of Famer Frank Robinson as the only players to win MVP in each league. Ohtani won the 2021 and 2023 AL MVP awards with the Los Angeles Angels and now the 2024 and 2025 NL MVP awards with the Dodgers.\nHe joins Aaron Judge, the Yankees captain who won the American League MVP over Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh.Ohtani, 31, had another thunderous season at the plate, slashing .282/.392/.622 with 55 home runs and 20 stolen bases. He led the National League in slugging percentage (.622) and OPS (1.014), and all of baseball in runs scored (146) and total bases (380). Ohtani's 6.6 WAR as a position player only ranked eighth in baseball.In June, Ohtani returned to the mound following his September 2023 elbow surgery. He threw 47 innings in 14 closely monitored starts and was terrific, pitching to a 2.87 ERA with 62 strikeouts and only nine walks. Ohtani amassed 1.1 WAR as a pitcher. His combined 7.7 WAR was third highest in baseball.\nSchwarber, now a free agent, slugged an NL-leading 56 home runs in 2025. He also led baseball with 132 RBI and hit .240/.365/.563 overall. Schwarber finished with 4.7 WAR despite starting 154 of 162 games at DH.Soto got off to a relatively slow start to his first season with the Mets, but rallied to finish the year with new career highs in home runs (43) and stolen bases (38). He hit .263/.396/.525 and was worth 6.2 WAR.Voting for the BBWAA's awards (Rookie of the Year, Manager of the Year, Cy Young, MVP) takes place before the postseason.

He is the 13th player with three MVPs. Only Barry Bonds (seven) and Shohei Ohtani (four), who won this year's National League MVP, have more. Judge is the fourth Yankee with three MVPs, joining Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio (1939, 1941, 1947), Yogi Berra (1951, 1954-55), and Mickey Mantle (1956-57, 1962).He joins Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers superstar who won National League MVP.Judge slashed .331/.457/.688 this season and led baseball in batting average by 20 points, on-base percentage by 58 points, and slugging percentage by 66 points. His 53 home runs were second in the AL behind Raleigh's 60. Judge's 9.7 WAR was 1.7 wins better than the next best player, per Baseball Reference's calculations. \n\n        \n            \n                Aaron Judge wins third MVP, but Yankees still searching for World Series ring during all-time great stretch\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRaleigh had a historic season and in fact is the first player other than Judge and Ohtani to receive a first-place AL MVP vote since José Abreu won the award in 2020. His 60 home runs are a new single-season record for a catcher, for a switch-hitter, and for a Seattle Mariner. Raleigh is one of only seven players with a 60-homer season. All told, Raleigh hit .247/.359/.589 and led the AL with 125 RBI, and also in games started at catcher (119) and innings caught (1,072). FanGraphs WAR, which includes catcher framing, pegs Raleigh as a 9.1 WAR player in 2025. That is third among all players behind Judge (10.1) and Ohtani (9.4). In just about any other year, Raleigh wins AL MVP with ease. Ramírez has finished in the top five of the MVP voting six times now, though he has yet to win the award. He had another tremendous season, hitting .283/.360/.503 with 30 home runs and 44 stolen bases. It was Ramírez's second straight and third career 30-30 season. His 5.8 WAR was sixth among AL position players. \nVoting for the BBWAA's awards (Rookie of the Year, Manager of the Year, Cy Young, MVP) takes place before the postseason.

The lawsuit states that the woman reported the incident to the NFL and that the league investigated and suspended Jackson.The woman, unnamed in the lawsuit, alleges violations of gender violence and revenge porn laws and accused Jackson of invasion of privacy, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and fraud. She initially reported the incident to the Los Angeles Police Department but elected not to pursue a criminal case and instead reported it to the NFL.According to the lawsuit, after the woman learned that Jackson had filmed her without consent, she demanded that he delete the video. Jackson refused, and she asked him again after leaving Los Angeles to return to Philadelphia. Jackson later said that he deleted the video but one day later sent it to her, indicating that he lied about its deletion.\nJackson was suspended for the first two games of the 2024 season for a violation of the NFL's personal conduct policy. Neither the league nor the Rams, Jackson and coach Sean McVay offered further details at the time of the suspension.Following his two-game absence, Jackson made his season debut in Week 3 and proceeded to start every game until the regular-season finale. He played 100% of the Rams' offensive snaps from Sept. 22 through Dec. 28 as a stalwart on the offensive line protecting quarterback Matthew Stafford's blind side.\nJackson has been in the lineup for each of the Rams' first nine games of the 2025 campaign. This is his fourth year as a starter, and he has remained healthy throughout the season after missing much of training camp with blood clots. He sat the final nine games of the 2022 season with the same issue.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No major conference team in college basketball is playing with more pace and operating with a more modernized offense -- prioritizing, like many an NBA team, 3-pointers and layups as their primary shot diet -- than the Alabama Crimson Tide. But on Thursday night it was ironically an old-school attack from No. 2 Purdue -- a deliberate halfcourt offense with high-level execution, control in the paint and punishing physicality -- that dealt the No. 8 Tide their first defeat of the young season.The final: Purdue 87, Alabama 80. Purdue scored the win as road underdogs and in the process proved it should not have been underdogs in this game -- and, perhaps, should not be underdogs in any game this season -- because of its inside-out star power and quality of depth. Braden Smith was the main attraction in this one: He finished with 29 points, four assists and seven boards. But co-star Trey Kaufman-Renn in his first appearance of the season coming off injury was highly effective, too, turning in 19 points, 15 boards and a game-high five assists. \n        \n            \n                First assessments of college basketball's top portal hauls: Grades for Kentucky, St. John's and more\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlabama coach Nate Oats said earlier this week Kaufman-Renn \"had his way\" with Alabama's frontcourt last November when he went for 26 points and eight boards and downed the Crimson Tide in West Lafayette. It was more of the same Thursday this time in Tuscaloosa. Kaufman-Renn made a team-high nine field goals, had a plus-minus of +20 to lead both teams and was a key component in maximizing Purdue's potent weapons around him.Contrasting stylesStyles make fights in college basketball and that's why Thursday's battle between these two top-10 teams was such a rare treat. Alabama leads the country in adjusted tempo among major conference teams, and its offensive style under Oats is simple: Take a 3-pointer or a layup, or find someone else who will. The sight of a shot chart where a player's toe is on the 3-point line physically makes Oats wince.\nPurdue's approach is much more nuanced. Its adjusted pace is seventh-slowest in the sport according to KenPom.com data. Its focus isn't just on 3-pointers and layups but rather on clean looks. Coach Matt Painter, as Oats said this week, has \"a gazillion sets and different counters to everything they do.\" The result is this beauty of a shot chart below that couldn't be much more different. Purdue on the right, you can see, took shots from deep, shots at the rim, shots around the elbows -- and everywhere in between. Alabama took almost exclusively 3-pointers, layups or shots inside the painted area. The two attempts outside the paint that weren't 3-pointers will undoubtedly be called out in film review as no-nos. I'd bet a dollar on it. Maybe even two.Purdue won with its own less modern approach Thursday but that is in no way a suggestion Alabama should consider tweaking its own attack. It didn't result in a win on this night because Purdue is a great college basketball team and it got great performances from its best players. But Alabama under Oats is 13-7 in games his team has attempted 40 or more 3-pointers. Two of those losses were in overtime, two of those losses were to Purdue, and three were games in which Bama was an underdog in the betting market by tipoff.\nThat's a long way to say: Oats' formula is a winning one. You don't get the Tide to a Final Four by happenstance and luck.Still, Purdue's operation was as efficient as a NASCAR pit crew. This game was not an indictment on Alabama's style but instead an ode to the goodness of Purdue's. It outscored Alabama 30-22 in the paint, won the battle on the boards 52 to 28 (!!!!) and pulled down 19 offensive rebounds -- helping it to 16 second-chance points in a category that may have been the deciding factor in the outcome.Purdue also made 23 2-point shots to Alabama's 12. Of those 23 for Purdue, six were layups and two were dunks. \n\"The tougher team won tonight,\" Oats said. \"They outrebounded us by 24. That's embarrassing.\"Purdue's key to victoryPainter and his staff are accustomed to, and keenly aware of, what Alabama wants to accomplish on offense. They've seen this team in three straight years now and have seen the dynamism of their outside shooting. So ironically, Painter after the game said Purdue's plan in this one -- against a team heavily reliant on 3s and highly successful in making them -- was to force the ball outside of the painted area and make them win on the perimeter.\"We wanted to square the ball [defensively] and keep it in front of us,\" Painter said. \"But we didn't want to give their big guys slips. We saw in their last game they got so many layups. We wanted to keep it on the perimeter. They took 44 3s. ... But at the end of the day, outside of Holloway, nobody really got away from us.\"\nOats' initial postgame assessment of Alabama's struggles -- outside of the obvious issues rebounding the ball -- was more or less the same. \"They collapsed heavy,\" he said. \"When they collapse as heavy as they did, they're going to give up 3s, and we got up 44. So they packed it in pretty tight and tried to keep it out of the lane.\"Purdue primed to jump to No. 1Despite a 2-0 start to its season, Purdue, the preseason No. 1 team in college basketball, was demoted to No. 2 earlier this week in the first in-season AP Top 25 poll of the season. It is just the second preseason No. 1 team in college basketball in two decades to fall from the No. 1 spot despite not suffering a loss. (The other: Kansas in 2018-19 fell from No. 1, leapfrogged by the RJ Barrett and Zion Williamson-led Duke Blue Devils.)\nI expect voters will rectify the mistake come Monday and push Purdue back to the top spot.With Kaufman-Renn back in the lineup this Purdue team is as formidable as we expected it'd be at full strength. A win over a top-10 road team that just days earlier defeated a top-five team on the road is an incredible feat. \"They're tough,\" Oats said. \"They deserved to win the game. In sports, it's nice when the team that deserves to win, wins. And they deserved to win this one tonight.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers are slowly but surely getting healthier, and Brock Purdy is the latest addition. Out since Week 4 with a toe injury, Purdy will return to the lineup in Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, coach Kyle Shanahan said according to Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area.Purdy, 25, initially suffered a reported \"variant of turf toe\" -- as well as a shoulder injury -- in Week 1, and he missed Weeks 2 and 3. He returned in Week 4 but aggravated the toe injury and has not played since. It's been, as Shanahan described it in late October, a \"sensitive situation.\" Purdy was listed as questionable but ultimately ended up being inactive in Week 10, too.\n        \n            \n                Turf toe injury: What is it? Why can't Joe Burrow, other NFL stars play through it? Medical experts explain\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMac Jones played solidly for the most part in Purdy's stead, accumulating a 5-3 record in eight starts this season. After winning each of his first three starts, Jones had six turnovers -- including five interceptions -- over his past five games, during which the 49ers went gone 2-3. Overall, Jones ranks 10th in yards per attempt this season, but his 13-6 touchdown to interception ratio is just 23rd out of 33 qualifying quarterbacks.Purdy, meanwhile, has thrown for for 586 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions in two games this season. A Pro Bowler after a historically efficient 2023 season, Purdy had a bit more of a down 2024 but still finished third in yards per attempt. Purdy is a more aggressive downfield passer and, depending on the health of his toe, a more mobile option than Jones; Purdy's 323 rushing yards last season ranked 11th among quarterbacks.\nAfter a lengthy recovery process, Purdy was once again officially a limited participant at Wednesday's practice. Shanahan, however, said it'd be an \"aggressive practice\" for Purdy, though technically not a full one.\"I think each week it's gotten better, with last week being the best,\" Shanahan said Wednesday, per the team's transcript. \"Each week has been different. So, if he takes a big step forward this week, like he did last week, he should have a good chance to play.\"Shanahan added it would not be a hard decision to reinstate Purdy as his starter. \"We've got a lot of confidence in Brock, and we know Brock will play at a high level too as long as he's healthy,\" he said.\nThe 49ers are 6-4 this season despite a bevy of injuries -- the team is also expected to have wide receiver Ricky Pearsall back this week -- and are currently eighth in the NFC standings, one spot out of the playoffs. San Francisco, which beat Arizona 16-15 in Week 3, has hit a bit of an easier patch in its schedule, with games against the Panthers, Browns and Titans following this weekend's trip to Arizona.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        'Thursday Night Football' kicks off NFL Week 11 with an AFC East rivalry as the New England Patriots host the New York Jets at 8:15 p.m. ET. Many bettors in the NFL player props market will gravitate towards New England, with it having the likes of Drake Maye, TreVeyon Henderson and Stefon Diggs. But a winning 'Thursday Night Football' SGP could also involve Jets standout running back Breece Hall and his NFL prop predictions. Coming off a season-high of 42 receiving yards, Hall has an over/under of 15.5 receiving yards among his TNF props. He also won't have to compete with receiver Garrett Wilson for touches, as the Jets wideout was placed on IR on Thursday due to a knee injury.It may be helpful with your Patriots vs. Jets SGP to know that no team has allowed more receptions to running backs this year than New England. In addition to including Thursday Night Football props in an NFL same-game parlay, you can also include picks versus the spread, on the money line and with the total. Which should you target to make your TNF SGP a winning one?

The second-year quarterback has gone over his passing yards prop in eight of his last 10 games, averaging 255.5 yards over this stretch. Maye should see very little deterrence from a Jets defense which recently traded away its two best players in DT Quinnen Williams and CB Sauce Gardner.Even with those players for most of the season, New York has the fewest interceptions, the sixth-fewest sacks and allows the seventh-highest passer rating. With New England having multiple injured running backs, including Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) being inactive, look for it to lean on Maye's arm over the ground game. Maye is projected to have 271.4 passing yards.

    "body": "\n        SEC heavyweight matchups highlight the slate of games to make Week 12 college football picks on with No. 4 Alabama (-6) vs. No. 11 Oklahoma and No. 10 Texas vs. No. 5 Georgia (-6.5) both set for Saturday as four of the nine winningest FBS programs all-time meet up. Meanwhile, the team they're all looking up to in the College Football Playoff rankings, No. 1 Ohio State, will have its first Big Ten matchup versus UCLA, with the Buckeyes favored by 31.5 points according to the Week 12 college football odds.That matchup will see Nico Iamaleava face the team where his Tennessee tenure ended against, as the Vols fell to Ohio State in last year's CFP. Is that extra incentive for the UCLA quarterback enough to back the Bruins with Week 12 college football predictions? Before locking in any Week 12 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to see the latest Week 12 college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and Week 12 college football betting lines on the spread, money line, and over/under. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top college football predictions for Week 12One of the college football picks the model is high on during Week 12: the 11th-ranked Oklahoma Sooners (+6, 45.5) cover versus No. 4 Alabama in a 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday kickoff. Oklahoma pulled off a road upset at Tennessee on Nov. 1 before having a bye last week, while Bama had a physical win over LSU on Saturday. One can't discount the rest advantage that provides the Sooners as Alabama has covered in just one of its last five games when it has a rest disadvantage. OU quarterback John Mateer is undefeated (3-0) on the road with Oklahoma and has 17 total touchdowns versus just two interceptions over his last six road games overall. The model forecasts Oklahoma to go into Tuscaloosa, Ala., and cover over 50% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nAnother prediction: No. 15 Miami (-15.5, 55.5) covers at home versus NC State on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET. Being at home is important to note for the Canes as NC State has lost both on the scoreboard and versus the spread in three straight road games. The Wolfpack's defense will be the weakest unit on the field come Saturday as it's allowed 41.7 points over its last three, while Miami's defense is the strength of its team. The Hurricanes rank 10th in FBS by allowing just 15 points per game, and of their last six home games, they've allowed a lone touchdown -- or no trips to the end zone at all -- in five of them. The model has Miami covering well over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 12The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 12, and it's calling for multiple upsets in major games, including a pair of ranked teams outright losing to unranked foes. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which ranked squads go down?

    "body": "\n        Philadelphia 76ers rookie VJ Edgecombe got off to a historic start to his NBA career on Wednesday night in his team's 117-116 win over the Boston Celtics. Edgecombe finished with 34 points, seven rebounds and three assists and broke records previously held by LeBron James and Allen Iverson in the process. Edgecombe, the No. 3 overall pick out of Baylor, broke a 22-year-old record set by James when he scored 14 points in the first quarter. James previously had the record for first-quarter points in an NBA debut when he scored 12 back in 2003. And when Edgecombe scored his 31st and 32nd points with a bucket at the 5:37 mark of the fourth quarter, he broke the 76ers franchise record for most points scored in an NBA debut previously held by Iverson, who scored 30 in his first game in 1996.\"It was pretty good,\" 76ers coach Nick Nurse said. \"Opening night. I think that there was some space for him to shoot. ... I think he took some drives. Certainly a great start. There's tons of room and different things he needs to do. I'd like him to be a little more aggressive in the open floor. I think he really has that in his game. That's an amazing first-game performance. It really is.\"Edgecombe's 34 points were the most in an NBA debut since Wilt Chamberlain set the all-time record with 43 in 1959. Edgecombe is now third all-time for points scored in a debut behind Chamberlain's 43 and Frank Selvy, who scored 35 points in 1954.\n\"That's pretty good,\" Nurse said with a chuckle when learning where Edgecombe's performance ranks in NBA history. \"He has a good motor. He played a ton of minutes. We certainly needed the offense. He certainly looked pretty comfortable out there. I think that's probably what I've noticed the most about him. He seems to know what's going on out there for a young player. You don't see him making silly mistakes. He's just playing the right way. He's got a very good feel for the game. That's pretty cool, though. That's a neat list to get on.\"\nThe 76ers trailed by 11 points entering the fourth but surged back behind the efforts of Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey, who combined for 74 points in the win. However, it nearly unraveled when Edgecombe missed two free throws with 8.5 seconds remaining, allowing Boston to have a chance at the win. However, the Celtics weren't able to convert, and the 76ers held on for a dramatic win in their season opener. Edgecombe got the start on opening night next to Maxey in the backcourt along with Kelly Oubre Jr., Dom Barlow and Joel Embiid. The early returns for the 76ers new-look backcourt were promising. While Edgecombe was breaking records, Maxey also had a standout performance by scoring 40 points. That number tied Hal Greer for the most points scored in franchise history during a season-opener. Embiid, meanwhile, tallied only four points in 20 minutes and was not on the floor in the final minutes of the game. \nEdgecombe, a blue-chip recruit in the 2024 recruiting cycle, saw his draft stock soar during his first and only season at Baylor under Scott Drew. Edgecombe established himself as one of the most athletic players at the collegiate level and continued to improve throughout the season. The 76ers passed on Ace Bailey -- who was selected two picks later by the Utah Jazz -- and instead drafted Edgecombe with the third selection. \n            ",

Both of those teams were on the precipice of winning a title when she took over -- Phoenix won in her first year and New York in her third -- but now Brondello will take on an extremely different challenge with the expansion Tempo. \n\n        \n            \n                Adam Silver says WNBA players will get 'big increase' in compensation as CBA negotiations continue\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Golden State Valkyries set the bar extremely high for the new franchises coming into the WNBA in this latest round of expansion, becoming the first team in league history to reach the playoffs in their inaugural season. That'll be difficult to match for Toronto, but Brondello will be able to help guide the franchise into building the kind of roster and culture that's necessary for contending in the long term. When the Tempo will get a chance to start building that roster is still unknown, as they are at the mercy of the ongoing CBA negotiations. The new expansion draft rules will be set in that new collective bargaining agreement, and with reports indicating the two sides aren't particularly close to a deal with the Oct. 31 deadline rapidly approaching, Toronto will likely be waiting a good bit longer before they get to start adding players officially. \nIn the meantime, Brondello and Tempo general manager Monica Wright Rogers can begin working out the kinds of players they want to target in an expansion draft and go through the many contingencies depending on what structure the league and WNBPA adopt for it. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        There is just one winless team in the NFL as we approach the end of October: The 0-7 New York Jets. A major reason for the Jets' lack of success is the performance of the quarterback, with Justin Fields on the verge of being benched.The Jets' passing offense, which averages 143.4 yards per game, ranks dead last in the NFL, and Fields has now registered fewer than 50 yards passing in back to back starts. That hasn't been done since 2006. Fields' poor play led to Jets owner Woody Johnson to bash him in front of reporters at the start of NFL league meetings, saying among other things, \"If we could complete a pass, it would look good.\"\"It's hard when you have a quarterback with a rating that ... he has the ability but something is just not [jibing,]\" Johnson said. \"But if you look at any head coach with a quarterback like that you're going to see similar results if you go across the league, you have to play consistently at that position, and that's what we're going to try to do for the remainder of the season.\"When asked about Johnson's comments on Wednesday, Fields took the high road. \"It doesn't bother me, it doesn't,\" Fields said. \"Of course everybody knows I need to play better, we need to play better as a team. No matter how the offense does as a unit, I'm going to get the blame and I understand that. That's just what comes with the job. It's what comes with it so you can't let anything kind of affect your mind, my mind. That is what it is, no matter if it's him, no matter if it's family members, even teammates sometimes. There's going to be times where you have to be the only one who believes in yourself. Like I said, that's his opinion. Like I told you guys after the game on Sunday, I'm at peace and all my focus is right now is working each and every day and getting better.\"\nJets coach Aaron Glenn even addressed Johnson's comments with his team. \"The first thing I'll say, he's an owner, and he has a right to his opinion, and when you look at that, it's really something that's been said across the board from everybody, including Justin: 'Man, we have to improve,'\" Glenn said. \"And we understand that. We've gone two games without scoring a touchdown, and we have to make sure we get better in that aspect. So we're all on the same page.\"Yeah it might be said different -- it might be said with different tones -- but we've all been on the same page when it comes to that, when it comes to our running back play, when it comes to our quarterback play, when it comes to our defensive play,\" Glenn continued. \"So, nothing's different about what we've done. We just said it in a different tone, in a different way. I'm glad we're on the same page on that, even with our quarterbacks, so we're just fine with that.\"It's unknown if Fields will start on Sunday when the Jets take on the Bengals in Cincinnati. New York's other quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, is day-to-day with a knee injury. Glenn told reporters he wouldn't reveal his starter to keep a \"competitive advantage.\" \nFields, who was the No. 11 overall pick of the Chicago Bears in 2021, is tied in having the worst record (14-36) by any quarterback through 50 career starts since 1970. It's true that he doesn't have the best infrastructure in the NFL with a first-time coach and first-time offensive coordinator, but as Fields noted to reporters on Wednesday, fingers are quick to point at the quarterback when things aren't going well.\n            ",

As expected, Payton has responded to Wilson calling the Broncos coach \"classless\" on social media -- that, in response to comments Payton made following last Sunday's dramatic, come-from-behind win over the Giants, for whom Wilson is a backup to Jaxson Dart. Wilson clearly took exception to Payton saying that he had hoped the Giants wouldn't have replaced Wilson with Dart until \"long after our game,\" but Payton responded Wedesday that his original comment \"was strictly about Dart\" and \"in no way, shape or form, anything that was directed at Russ.\"\"I might be able to see how he might perceive that, but coming off that win and watching how [Dart] played, that wasn't [my] intention at all,\" Payton said. \nWhile Payton enjoyed a legendary partnership with Drew Brees during their years with the Saints, he and Wilson had one of the ugliest coach-quarterback relationships in NFL history. Even the feud between former Cowboys coach Barry Switzer and QB Troy Aikman looked tame by comparison. \n        \n            \n                Russell Wilson and Sean Payton's feud explained: How years of tension led QB to call his ex-coach 'classless'\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter two tumultuous years together, Payton and Wilson both got want they wanted: a breakup and a fresh start with someone else. Payton has found success again with second-year quarterback Bo Nix, who appears poised to lead the Broncos back to the playoffs for a second straight year. \nConversely, Wilson is trying to find his professional footing after having an up-and-down season in Pittsburgh and losing his job this season in New York to Dart, who appears to be this year's version of Nix. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Two days after being caught on video lashing out in the tunnel on his way back to the locker room following the meltdown against the Denver Broncos, New York Giants outside linebacker Brian Burns denied that his rant was directed at defensive coordinator Shane Bowen or the decision to drop eight in coverage and only rush three on the final series. Burns had the most publicly visceral reaction of any Giants player after his team allowed 33 points in the fourth quarter of a shocking 33-32 loss.As the Giants walked back to the visitors' locker room, James Palmer of The Athletic filmed Burns yelling about the loss, explicitly yelling about the Giants' defense clinging to a 32-30 lead in the final half minute. Needing to keep the Broncos out of field goal range, the Giants dropped eight into coverage while only rushing three at Broncos quarterback Bo Nix -- using Beau Brade and Nic Jones while Dexter Lawrence and Abdul Carter were kept on the sidelines. The lack of pass rush availed Nix enough time to find an open receiver for a 29-yard gain, instantly putting Denver at the edge of field goal range for the eventual winning score.In Palmer's video, Burns seemed to be raging about that specific play: \"Stupid ass shit, dropping eight!\"\nIn comments made to reporters in the locker room, Burns also pointed to how the Giants were \"rushing three and dropping eight\" when discussing the lack of pressure sent at Nix. But Tuesday, Burns seemingly walked back his remarks, claiming that he had been taken out of context, before telling reporters Wednesday that his \"dropping eight\" remark was him being incredulous the Broncos had completed a pass downfield despite eight players being in coverage.\n\"We called a call specifically to take away that play. And the fact that Nix wasn't even trying to throw it to (Marvin) Mims and it just so happened to be completed, that's kind of like a disbelief,\" Burns said. \"Like, 'Bro, there's no way that we dropped eight and we still couldn't stop that ball from being completed.' That's moreso where my frustration lied.\n\"It wasn't nothing towards the call, and that's what I tried to clear up. But people are gonna feel what they want to feel, so it is what it is.\"After playing soft coverage and paying the price for it yet again, the heat is once again on Bowen, whom the Giants hired in 2024 after an explosive falling out between coach Brian Daboll and former defensive coordinator Wink Martindale. Middle linebacker and team captain Bobby Okereke tried to take the heat off of Bowen on Monday, claiming that the defense still supports its coach.\"We're all hands on deck. We're all bought in,\" Okereke said. \"Everyone's got to look at  the man in the mirror. It's easier to point the finger but from a team  perspective, it's better to point the thumb and figure out what I can do  better as an individual. So, that's what we're all about to do. And  we're excited for this upcoming opportunity.\"\nThe Giants' collapse against the Broncos marks one of the worst meltdown losses in team history, taking its place in infamy alongside their 2002 Wild Card meltdown against the San Francisco 49ers and the \"Matt Dodge Game\" against the Philadelphia Eagles in 2010.\n            ",

Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for just 100 yards and tossed three interceptions before being replaced by rookie Quinn Ewers in the fourth quarter.One of the more glaring takeaways from Sunday's loss was the fact that Dolphins receiver Jaylen Waddle only was targeted four times and caught just one pass for 15 yards. On Wednesday, Tagovailoa revealed that his height kept him from being able to get the ball to his star wideout.\"Some of it has to do with being able to see guys ... I'm not the tallest guy in the back there either,\" said Tagovailoa who stands 6-foot-1. \"So being able to see and then sometimes when that happens, you don't want to just throw it blindly, and you gotta progress. So I think that has some merit to, reasons as to why that happened for Waddle.\"\nTagovailoa completed just 12 of 23 passes, was sacked twice threw three second-half interceptions. The first one came on the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter when Cleveland's Tyson Campbell returned the ball 34 yards for a touchdown to extend the Browns' lead to 24-6. The second interception came on a 3rd and 12 from the Miami 3-yard line and was nearly returned for another pick six. The Browns scored a touchdown on the next play. His passer rating on the day was a dismal 24.1.The veteran signal caller actually only targeted Waddle three times and Ewers targeted Waddle once before the final whistle sounded. \nDespite Tagovailoa's struggles in recent weeks, coach Mike McDaniel confirmed earlier this week that Tagovailoa would be the team's starter against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 8. Tagovailoa has thrown three interceptions in back-to-back games and became the first NFL quarterback to do so since Philip Rivers did it in 2019.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins signed quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension in July 2024 a couple of days after training camp opened. Nothing has gone smoothly for Tagovailoa since signing the extension.Tagovailoa suffered his third diagnosed NFL concussion during a Week 2 game versus the Buffalo Bills last season. Because of the increasing severity of the concussions, there were calls for Tagovailoa to retire. Tagovailoa returned to action after missing four games while on injured reserve because of the head trauma.Performance has been the primary issue with Tagovailoa this season. Tagovailoa is coming off his second straight three-interception game in Week 7 against the Cleveland Browns, which dropped Miami's record to 1-6. He was benched for 2025 seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers during the fourth quarter of the Browns game.Tagovailoa's 10 interceptions are tied for the NFL lead. His 82.8 passer rating and 9.4 yards per completion are the worst in his six NFL seasons. Throwing teammates under the bus publicly for being late to or missing players only team meetings following Week 6's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers hasn't helped Tagovailoa's cause.\nTagovailoa's regression has prompted speculation about him losing his starting job. A quarterback change won't be taking place for Week 8's game with the Atlanta Falcons. It will only be a matter of time before Tagovailoa is replaced in the lineup despite Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel's vote of confidence in his Wednesday press conference, unless the quarterback has a turnaround.Tagovailoa's decline is raising questions about how much longer he will be in Miami. A trade won't be a realistic possibility given Tagovailoa's poor play and the durability concerns because of his multiple concussions.Tagovailoa's contract holds the answers. There aren't any good solutions for the Dolphins because of the way the deal was structured.\nTagovailoa's contract detailsTagovailoa's $53.1 million-per-year extension runs though the 2028 season. His contract has $167.171 million in guarantees where $93.171 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The $93.171 million included a $42 million signing bonus, which is prorated on the salary cap at $8.4 million annually from 2024 through 2028.Tagovailoa's deal contains two option bonuses. The double-option bonus is one of the more complicated structures with NFL contracts.Tagovailoa's fully guaranteed $50.046 million 2025 base salary reduced to $25.046 million when an option for a dummy or fake 2029 contract year voiding five days after the 2028 league year's Super Bowl in February 2029 was exercised this past March during the first couple of days of the current league year. There was a corresponding $25 million payment (i.e.; option bonus) in order to get this dummy contract year. \nOption bonuses are prorated over the life of a contract (up to a maximum of five years), including the option years, beginning in the league year when the option is exercised. This means the $25 million option bonus is prorated on the salary cap at $5 million annually from 2025 through 2029.The second option must be picked up between the first day (March 11) and 10th day (March 20) of the 2026 league year. Paying the required $15 million for Tagovailoa's dummy 2030 contract year, which also voids five days after the 2028 league year's Super Bowl, will drop his fully guaranteed $54 million 2026 base salary to a fully guaranteed $39 million. This $54 million was guaranteed for injury at signing and became completely secure in March on the third day of the 2025 league year.From a salary cap standpoint, the presumption is option years will be picked up. Because of this, the $15 million is being prorated on the salary cap at $3 million annually from 2026 through 2030.\nTagovailoa's 2026 cap number is listed as $56.4 million. The components are $8.4 million of signing bonus proration, $5 million of option bonus proration (the first option), $3 million of option bonus proration (the second option), Tagovailoa's reduced $39 million base salary, a $250,000 workout bonus and $750,000 in per-game roster bonuses ($44,117.65 for each game active). There's another relevant part of Tagovailoa's contract. It's his 2027 base salary. Out of this $31 million, $20 million was guaranteed for injury at signing. Next March 13 on the third day of the 2026 league year, $3 million of the $20 million is fully guaranteed. Another $17 million becomes fully guaranteed on the third day of the 2027 league year.Here are scenarios in which the Dolphins could part ways with Tagovailoa and the financial impacts each would present:\n\n        \n            \n                Bill Cowher skewers 'disinterested' Dolphins after 1-6 start: 'We see the product that's on the field'\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nScenario 12026 release: No post-June 1 designation/no option exercise $42.8 million 2026 salary cap increase/$99.2 million 2026 dead moneyCutting Tagovailoa conventionally in 2026 is virtually impossible. The Dolphins would have $99.2 million in dead money, a cap charge for a player no longer on the roster, by releasing Tagovailoa before exercising the option for his voiding 2030 contract year and $3 million of the $20 million guaranteed for injury in 2027 becomes fully guaranteed next March 13. The record for dead money related to an individual player in one league year is quarterback Russell Wilson's $53 million because of the Denver Broncos releasing him in March 2024. The $99.2 million for the 2026 league year would be close to twice as much as Wilson's record-setting amount.Without exercising the option, Tagovailoa's fully guaranteed $54 million 2026 base salary would count entirely on Miami's books. There also wouldn't be any of the proration for the $15 million option bonus that wouldn't be paid.\nThe dead money would consist of Tagovailoa's fully guaranteed $54 million 2026 base salary, $25.2 million of signing bonus proration relating to his 2026 through 2028 contract years and the $20 million of option bonus proration from these three contract years as well as the dummy 2029 contract year.Scenario 22026 release: Post-June 1 designation/no option exercise $11 million 2026 salary cap increase/$67.4 million 2026 dead money/$31.8 million 2027 dead moneyReleasing Tagovailoa with a post-June 1 designation isn't as cap prohibitive as cutting him conventionally. Nonetheless, the 2026 dead money is $11 million more than Tagovailoa's listed 2026 cap figure. The same timing as without using a post-June 1 designation would apply.A team can release two players each league year before June 2 using a post-June 1 designation that will be treated under the cap as if released after June 1. With a post-June 1 designation, a team is required to carry the player's full cap number until June 2 even though he is no longer part of the roster. \nThe player's salary comes off the books at that time unless it is guaranteed. Tagovailoa's 2026 base salary wouldn't reduce from $54 million to $39 million because the option isn't being exercised under this scenario. Since this $54 million base salary is already fully guaranteed, it would remain a Miami cap charge. Only the current year's bonus proration counts toward the cap with players released using a post-June 1 designation. The acceleration of the bonus proration in future contract years is delayed until the following league year (2027 in this case), which typically begins in early to mid-March.The total dead money or residual cap charges is still $99.2 million. It's taken over two years with $67.4 million in 2026 and $31.8 million in 2027 instead of all during the 2026 league year. The $67.4 million consists of the $54 million 2026 base salary, $8.4 million in 2026 signing bonus proration and $5 million in 2026 option bonus proration. \nThe $31.8 million for 2027 would be composed of $16.8 million in signing bonus proration from Tagovailoa's 2027 and 2028 contract years and the $15 million in option bonus proration relating to the final three years of the deal, which includes the voiding 2029 contract year. Tagovailoa would be off Miami's books beginning in 2028 with use of a post-June 1 designation.Scenario 3 2026 release: Post-June 1 designation/option exercised $1 million 2026 salary cap savings/$55.4 million 2026 dead money/$43.8 million 2027 dead moneyThe only viable option for getting rid of Tagovailoa in 2026 is releasing him with a post-June 1 designation after exercising the second option. The timing would be the same as with the other two scenarios.The Dolphins will have $1 million in 2026 cap savings by releasing Tagovailoa in this manner. The difference from Tagovailoa's listed $56.4 million cap number would be the removal of his $250,000 workout bonus and $750,000 of per-game roster bonuses from Miami's salary cap on June 2.\nThe $16.8 million of signing bonus prorated in the 2027 and 2028 contract years, the $15 million in first option bonus prorated from those two contract years in addition to the voiding 2029 contract years and the $12 million in option bonus proration from the 2027 and 2028 contract years as well as the voiding 2029 and 2030 contract years would be 2027 cap charges. This $43.8 million in 2027 dead money would represent a $9.6 million cap savings for the Dolphins from Tagovailoa's $53.4 million cap number. Miami wouldn't have any more cap charges for Tagovailoa after 2027.Tagovailoa's guarantees have offsets so Miami would get some nominal 2026 cap relief from the contract he signed with another team. Presumably, Tagovailoa would sign for league-minimum salary in 2026, just like Wilson did in 2024, because of his massive base-salary guarantee.The $99.2 million of residual cap charges taken over two years, 2026 and 2027, would also be a record for most the dead money relating to a single player contract. That's currently the combined $85 million for Wilson from 2024 and 2025 because he was released with a post-June 1 designation. The offset isn't being factored into these calculations.Scenario 4 2027 release: No post-June 1 designation$6.6 million 2027 salary cap savings/$46.8 million 2027 dead moneyThe Dolphins will need to release Tagovailoa before the third day of the 2027 league year to avoid being on the hook for an additional $17 million in 2027 salary. The 2027 dead money is $46.8 million rather than the $43.8 million by releasing Tagovailoa in 2026 with a post-June 1 designation as in Scenario 3 because of the $3 million of his 2027 salary being fully guaranteed in March 2026.The components are the same as with a post-June 1 designation release in Scenario 3, plus the $3 million 2027 salary guarantee. The cap savings would increase to $9.6 million because of the offset with the salary guarantee provided Tagovailoa could sign a contract elsewhere in 2027 for $3 million or more. Regardless, Tagovailoa would be off Miami's books starting in 2028.Scenario 5 2027 release: Post-June 1 designation $34 million 2027 salary cap savings/$19.4 million 2027 dead money/$27.4 million 2028 dead moneyThe timing of releasing Tagovailoa will be the same whether or not a post-June 1 designation is used. By using a post-June 1 designation, the Dolphins would have $19.4 million in 2027 dead money composed of the $8.4 million in 2027 signing bonus proration, $5 million in 2027 first option bonus proration, $3 million in 2027 second option bonus proration and the $3 million 2027 base salary guarantee. The $27.4 million of dead money in 2028 would consist of $8.4 million in 2028 signing bonus proration, $10 million in first option bonus proration from the 2028 contract year and 2029 voiding contract year and $9 million in second option bonus proration from the 2028 contract year, as well as the 2029 and 2030 contract years. Tagovailoa would be off Miami's books beginning in 2029.Final thoughtsConventional wisdom has suggested Tagovailoa will be with the Dolphins in 2026. Miami's 2026 salary cap situation is less than ideal for letting Tagovailoa go next year. The Dolphins have the NFL's fourth-most 2026 cap commitments at $320.051 million with 36 players under contract, according to NFLPA data. The top 51 salaries (i.e.; salary cap numbers) matter under offseason accounting rules. There's just under $715,000 of existing cap space that can be carried over to 2026. Assuming the 2026 salary cap is set in the $300 million to $305 million range, getting $1 million in cap relief by releasing Tagovailoa with a post-June 1 designation next March will only marginally affect the overage.This thinking was before Tagovailoa's subpar play. Unless Tagovailoa can start regaining his previous form where Miami starts winning games, there will likely be changes in 2026 with McDaniel being fired at a minimum. It would be interesting to see whether a new regime would even want Tagovailoa to be a bridge quarterback next season with the plan being to find his successor early in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the old saying goes, records are made to be broken.That hasn't been the case through the early portion of the 2025 season, as records aren't falling as consistently as in previous years. Mike Evans was on a quest for his 12th consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season -- which would have broken Jerry Rice's record for the most in NFL history. An early-season hamstring injury jeopardized the streak, then a broken clavicle ended any chance of Evans setting the mark.While Evans won't be setting any records in 2025, several players (and coaches and teams) are still chasing longstanding marks. This season isn't one where offensive numbers are off the charts, but some records are in jeopardy as the league approaches the halfway point.Which records stand a chance of being broken? Who is within striking distance of historic NFL marks? A few are in danger of being snapped.Jaxon Smith-Njigba -- Single-season receiving yards\nSmith-Njigba is on a historic pace heading into Seattle's bye week, as the Seahawks receiver leads the league with 819 receiving yards. His 117.0 yards per game average isn't on track to top Wes Chandler's record of 127.0 (1982), but it puts Smith-Njigba on pace to break Calvin Johnson's single-season record of 1,964 (2012).\nWhile Johnson set the record in a 16-game season, Smith-Njigba isn't going to apologize for playing in a 17-game schedule. He's on pace for 1,989 receiving yards, which would surpass Johnson's mark by 25. Five 100-yard games and an average of 10 targets per game have certainly helped.Brian Burns, Byron Young -- Single-season sacksBurns and Young each lead the league with 9.0 sacks and are entering the conversation for potentially catching Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021), who share the single-season record with 22.5 sacks. Both Burns and Young have played seven games, putting them on pace for 22.0.Each would need to average 1.35 sacks per game to tie Strahan and Watt. Burns has 4.0 sacks over his last two games, while Young has 3.5 in that span. Both are part of stacked defensive lines, so it's very possible their hot streaks will either continue or reignite later this season.\nDrake Maye, Jared Goff -- Highest completion percentage in a seasonThis one will be tough to break, but both Maye and Goff are within range. Maye leads the NFL in completion percentage (75.2%), the third-highest mark through seven games in league history, and is on pace to beat Drew Brees' record of 74.4% (2018).Goff is second in the league (74.9%), also ahead of Brees' pace. It's still early in the season, and one bad game could drop either passer behind Brees' mark, but both have gotten off to historically efficient starts.Jonathan Taylor -- Single-season rushing touchdowns\nThe rushing touchdown record has stood since 2006, when LaDainian Tomlinson scored 28 times. Taylor has 10 rushing touchdowns through seven games and an outside shot at matching Tomlinson.\nTaylor is on pace for 24 touchdowns, which would fall four short of Tomlinson but still mark the most in a season since 2006. That total would also tie John Riggins for the fifth most in NFL history.Taylor has seven touchdowns over his last three games and three outings with three or more scores this season. Tomlinson's record could be in jeopardy if the Colts' offense keeps rolling with Taylor as the centerpiece.\n        \n            \n                Party like it's 2009: How the 2025 Colts have shocked the NFL as legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n                \n                    Douglas Clawson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBaker Mayfield -- Single-season fourth-quarter comebacks \nMayfield has cooled off a bit from his hot start, but the reason the Buccaneers quarterback was in the early MVP discussion is because of Tampa Bay's late-game rallies. The Bucs had last-minute comeback victories in each of their first three games and in four of their first five.\nMayfield has four game-winning drives through seven games and is on pace to break the record of eight shared by Matthew Stafford (2016) and Kirk Cousins (2022). He needs four more to tie them and five more to surpass the mark -- putting him on pace for nine this season.If the Buccaneers keep playing close games, Mayfield will have more chances to add to that total. Of course, Tampa Bay would prefer less-stressful wins -- as would Mayfield.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys explosive linebacker DeMarvion Overshown is back... at practice. The 25-year-old, who tore his ACL in the 2023 preseason as a rookie and then his ACL again, MCL and PCL on Thanksgiving last year, returned to practice on Wednesday in a limited capacity. Overshown went through individual position drills and then more conditioning with him treating the practices right now as his version of training camp.  \"Ain't God good man. He is. He is. It's a blessing just to be out there. Been watching for 300-plus days now. So when you [are] a guy like me that football is more than just a game to you, it's a way of life, you play with a passion and that energy. When you're able to do it again, you never take it for granted,\" Overshown said.He plans to make his debut as the first Cowboy to wear the jersey No. 0 in a game after Dallas' bye in Week 11 at the Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\"\"That game, I mean, that's what we're looking like. Monday night prime time. Zero will be making his debut. I'm excited for it. It's not going to be anything short of extraordinary,\" Overshown said. \"I'm ready to show truly how blessed I am. A lot of people claim that this knee injury is one of the worst of the worst and not too many people come back the same afterward. I'm ready to put that to the test.\"\nBelieve it or not, Overshown felt like he was capable of moving around and doing everything right as Cowboys training camp kicked off at the end of July. Now, his process is more general conditioning than it is physical therapy-specific workouts. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 8 NFL picks: Cowboys beat Broncos in shootout, Packers spoil Aaron Rodgers' revenge game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Really before training camp. I kind of got an idea of where I should be just from the first knee injury. So once I got to that five, six-month period, it's like 'alright I should be doing a little bit of moving.' Once I start moving around, it's like 'I'm going to be good.' It's a confidence thing and [a] mind thing at that point,\" Overshown said. \"My knee is healed, now it's learning how to run again, learning how to be an NFL football player again. Because you know you don't just wake up and do that overnight after being on a walker. I feel like for about four months I've been comfortable with my knee. It's just been getting into football ready shape.\"Overshown is a player whose game is built around eye-popping athleticism, and he feels like his signature burst will be even better when he does take the field in a live game in November despite returning from a gruesome injury. \n\"I'm stronger, and we've got the numbers to prove it. But stronger, faster, jump higher, more explosive. You name it, I'm all of it. My game, it's not going to slow down. I think one of the worst things I heard over my rehab time was, 'Man, you've got to slow down. We need you to play a full season. You've got to slow down.' But that ain't how I play,\" Overshown said. \"I know how to play one way, and that's 100, full speed and that's all you're going to see. So the knee is stronger than strong.\"    \nThe energy Overshown has already shown in practice and throughout his rehab has caught the eyes of teammates, especially new Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens who can't wait to see Overshown in a game up close for the first time.\"D-Mo is another type of deal that I've never seen, especially at the linebacker position. He can do everything, so I haven't ever seen that -- let alone all the highlights,\" Pickens said Wednesday. \"I'm kind of ready to see it in real time. ... He's got different swag. I told you he's a different type of dude. I'm just waiting to see it in person because it's my first year here.\"\nHow Overshown could provide Parsons-like impact for Dallas' defenseDallas' defense hasn't been nearly as productive pressuring opposing quarterbacks, sacking opposing quarterbacks or in any defensive metric across the board than they have been in years past with All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons being traded away to the Green Bay Packers. The 2025 Cowboys defense under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus ranks bottom five in the NFL in multiple defensive metrics including being dead last in total defense (401.6 total yards per game allowed), pass defense (260.3 passing yards per game allowed) and third down defense (51.6% third down conversion rate allowed). It's not entirely surprising given the Cowboys defense had the NFL's highest expected points added (EPA) per play when Parsons was on the field (0.08) from 2021-2024 and the NFL's lowest EPA per play when Parsons was off the field (-0.04) in the same span, per CBS Sports Research.Cowboys defense this seasonStatsNFL RanksPoints per game allowed29.4 29thTotal yards allowed401.6LastYards per play allowed6.130thPass yards per game allowed260.3  LastRush yards per game allowed 141.330thThird-down conversion rate allowed51.6% LastQB pressure rate39.9% 11thSacks15T-14thPasser rating allowed110.6 31stTakeaways6T-23rdZone coverage rate81.9% 4thMan coverage rate13.5% 29thBlitz rate25.4%21stHowever, the Cowboys could see a noticeable uptick in production with his electrifying athleticism back on the field. In Week 1 of the 2024 season at the Cleveland Browns, Overshown's first game back after his first ACL tear, he exploded to sack quarterback Deshaun Watson in 2.8 seconds and beat Parsons to the spot. That blew the All-Pro's mind and had him declaring big things about Overshown's future, saying he would become an All-Pro like him. \n\"I don't even know what happened,\" Parsons said last season. \"I'm going to tell you. I was like, 'Bro, you're gonna have people who think you're faster than me now.' I say, 'I can't take any more breaks. That's what those fresh legs are getting you.' He's [Overshown] so fast. He's explosive, though. I told him after the game how proud I was of him. ... He's coming downhill with intent with everything. He's one of the most exciting players that I've seen. I think he's going to be an All-Pro player.\"  \nSeeing what Overshown can be as a pass rusher, there's already a tried and true method for him to join Parsons in the All-Pro ranks. Like Overshown, Parsons began his career playing primarily out of the inside linebacker spot, 55.2% of his snaps as a rookie according to Pro Football Focus. Micah Parsons' Cowboys defensive snap alignment, 2021-2023202120222023Defensive Line41.3%81.1%87.2%Linebacker55.2%18.1%12.7%Defensive Back3.5%0.8%0.1%*Data according to Pro Football FocusIf Dallas were to ease Overshown into playing more as an edge rusher along the line of scrimmage, there's a chance that type of positional switch could lead to similar results to Parsons' given both have elite athleticism. Overshown also has enough knowledge of Eberflus' playbook after attaching himself at the hip to the DC and taking charge in team meetings. It's a change the Cowboys' edge rusher group needs: Dallas' top two leaders in quarterback pressures through seven weeks are their two defensive tackles, Kenny Clark (23) and Osa Odighizuwa (20).\"I'm just going to do what I know I can do. When I get in between those lines, the sky's the limit for me. I'm not saying that to be cocky or anything, but I know what I bring to the field,\" Overshown said. \"Hearing things and seeing like, 'Oh, we need D-Mo to be this when he comes back,' or 'We need D-Mo to do this,' I am not worried about [that]. I know what I bring to the table. I know what y'all saw last year and I know y'all going to get more of that. So it's really no stress and no pressure on me to go back out and do anything. I know what I'm capable of. Last year was still me just getting my feet wet, so still really [we] haven't seen what all I can do.\"\n            ",

    "description": "\n        You really don't appreciate a point guard until you don't have one. Just ask the Houston Rockets, who lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 125-",
    "body": "\n        You really don't appreciate a point guard until you don't have one. Just ask the Houston Rockets, who lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 125-124, in double overtime on Tuesday in a game it felt like they would have won had Fred VanVleet been on the floor to organize composed, consistent offensive sets.   But they didn't have VanVleet, and they're not going to for the rest of the year due to his torn ACL. To whatever degree one game can be any sort of reliable future indicator, they're going to need to figure this out.   First, some qualifiers:  Despite their offense looking equals parts chaotic and cramped for the better part of the game, the Rockets still managed to convert enough tough buckets, and secure enough offensive rebounds (16!), to lead for most of the game against the defending champs. Alperen Sengun was out of his mind with 39 points. Kevin Durant made a bunch of highly contested shots look easy, as he does. Amen Thompson looked terrific getting downhill and initiating leveraged contact to create comfortable finishing space, especially when he was provided a runway. Jabari Smith Jr. made a number of high-stakes/bailout shots. The Rockets were playing against the best defense in the basketball world. Sure, Jalen Williams was out, but all that meant was more Cason Wallace, who is an absolute dog on the ball. Houston is not going to face this kind of pressure on a nightly basis, and as such, it surely won't look this out of sorts moving forward. It was the first game of the season (this warrants constant repeating) and they're trying to integrate a brand-new superstar in Durant, who likes the ball in particular places and in stationary positions that don't necessarily lend themselves to full-floor space creation. The Rockets are not going to be a great movement offense and will, generally speaking, have to do their damage ugly -- with sheer size and difficult individual shot-making. Still, Houston turned the ball over on an abysmal 22% of its possessions (24 total) and scored just 109.7 points per 100 possessions, per Cleaning the Glass, which would've ranked as the fourth-worst offense in the league last season. Starved for basically any breathing room all night, they found themselves operating out of a phone booth into which three people were seemingly crammed.   \tThis is why you need a point guards. They relieve their teammates of pressure they're generally not equipped to handle over the course of full possessions. They create initial advantages, forcing the defense into rotation out of pick-and-roll or just their own skillful ball-handling, and then the domino effect takes over as the defense finds itself, well, on defense.   \t\nWithout a point guard to get the car out of the barn and onto a clear stretch of road, a defense like Oklahoma City can turn offensive and start to attack the space of secondary ball-handlers forced into primary positions.   \tLook how much trouble Houston has simply getting a regular possession started in the clip below. Sengun, a 7-foot center, is the initial ball-handler, but as soon as Alex Caruso presses up on him in the backcourt, he can't get rid of it fast enough to Tari Eason. He looks totally overwhelmed by the pressure he's facing and nearly loses his dribble before flinging a desperate pass backwards to Reed Sheppard, who finds himself pinned on the half-court line.   \tBy the time Sheppard gets it back to Sengun 40 feet from the basket, the shot clock is at 10 seconds and they haven't even started the possession. From there, nothing gets any easier. Watch how hard Durant has to fight just to catch the ball at the 3-point line with Caruso suffocating every inch of space and just four seconds to figure out a way to pull a shot out of thin air -- which he does because he's Kevin Durant, but this is not a shot even one of the greatest shot-makers in history can survive on consistently.   \t\nIt's true, this is why the Rockets got Durant. To make shots like this. Which he's going to have to do plenty of on a Houston team that started two centers on Tuesday and generally lacks for shooters. Spacing is not going to be a luxury in Houston. Still, it can't be this hard to initiate basic offense. These guys are fighting for their lives just to wind up with a 27% 3-point shooter flinging up a corner 3 as the shot clock is about to expire.   \t\nSengun, as mentioned, was brilliant. And as big men go, he's a supremely skilled ball-handler. But he's not a point guard, and if you're going to ask him to handle the ball and create advantages at the top of the offense against good defensive teams off the dribble, you're going to end up with a lot of this.   \tMeanwhile, the aforementioned Sheppard is supposed to be one of the guys to step in for VanVleet, and he was having genuine trouble even getting the ball past halfcourt cleanly.   \t\nHere again, with less than a minute to play in double overtime and the game tied at 122, Sheppard dribbles from side to side without ever creating any forward progress. Finally, he's stuck 35 feet from the basket and has to lob a pass even farther from the basket to Durant, who is being mugged by Lu Dort. Turnover.   \tThis was literally the first pass of the possession. We're not talking about a situation where the ball moved side to side and a couple guys attacked closeouts and the OKC defense just kept rotating and moving its feet cutting it all off. This was the first pass. As an NBA team, if you can't even get a possession started, you're signing up for bailout shots at the end.   \tAnd again, Durant and Sengun are capable of making a lot of those. Durant can shoot over anyone and Sengun is a bull in a china shop against mismatches. The fact that they converted over 50% of their 40 combined shots in the opener, given the difficulty of their diet, bordered on miraculous. And the Rockets still functioned like a bottom-five offense.   \t\nIt bears repeating they were playing one of the best defenses ever, and a lot of the credit goes to the Thunder. But what happens when Sengun and Durant aren't rescuing these clunky possessions? It's early, of course. Houston is going to be very good and can probably use a lot of the regular season to figure some of this stuff out without compromising too much playoff positioning.But at the end of the day, barring a trade, the Rockets are without a natural point guard. And that could be a serious problem for a team that expects to contend for a championship.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When news came out that Jayden Daniels suffered a knee sprain in Week 2 against the Packers, Dan Quinn knew what to say.\"With Jayden, we know how important he is ... It's day by day to make sure that he can absolutely be himself.\"And later ...\"It gets more attention, for sure, and look here: We recognize, like, what Jayden is and the impact that he has here, but I'd be BS-ing if I said we wouldn't care about those guys in the same way.\"Translation: We make sure all of our players are healthy, and we go through all of the return-to-play measures equally, but we know we have to treat our franchise quarterback with special care. As every team should.\nDaniels ended up missing two games and wore a brace -- to his chagrin -- for the next three. The Commanders didn't have media availability Wednesday, when it was reported that Daniels will miss a Week 8 \"Monday Night Football\" showdown against the Chiefs due to a low-grade hamstring strain suffered against the Cowboys in Week 7, but you can bet Quinn will repeat a similar refrain Thursday.After playing in all 20 games (including playoffs) as a rookie, Daniels is now slated to miss his third game already this season.Everyone wanted a piece of Daniels and the Commanders after his historic rookie season led Washington to its first NFC Championship Game appearance in over 30 years. Washington has eight standalone games this season, tied with Dallas for most in the league, and on paper entering the year, that made sense. Reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year? Check. Big names back? Check. More big names arriving? Check.\nBut that team is not this one. The Commanders are 3-4, and myriad issues have become apparent with this team, some without any clear solutions.\n        \n            \n                What's wrong with the Commanders? Why Washington is struggling and why turnaround might not be coming\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn one hand, the Commanders are running out of time to save this much-anticipated campaign, and it appears the margins will only get slimmer without Daniels. After the news of Daniels' absence emerged, the Chiefs climbed to 11.5-point favorites (per FanDuel Sportsbook) at Arrowhead Stadium, where the Commanders have never won. Could Marcus Mariota pull off an upset? Sure, we suppose. He has performed well in relief of Daniels several times over the past few seasons.But in all likelihood, even if Mariota plays well, the Commanders, who are already 13th in the ultra-competitive NFC, will fall to 3-5. That would match their loss total from all of last season with more than half of this campaign to go.\nIn the short term, any loss is a disappointment. In the medium term, a 3-5 record and one of the league's hardest schedules remaining spells a likely postseason-less season; SportsLine already has Washington down to a 14% chance to make the playoffs.But in the long term, medium term and short term, it's the right choice.\nA franchise quarterback is not a commodity to be trifled with. Perhaps earlier versions of this franchise, with a meddlesome owner, would have looked at a schedule full of nationally televised games and pushed their shiny star to play. Success for this franchise has been so fleeting that capitalizing on attention was priority No. 1.But this new regime -- owner Josh Harris, general manager Adam Peters, Quinn and others -- knows how to take a long view, even if the TV schedule and preseason predictions and, to be fair, offseason transactions said \"win now.\"\nQuinn has already displayed his acumen dealing with the ultra-competitive Daniels, who pleaded to play through the knee sprain and wanted to return to the Dallas game.\"It's good that I've known him for a year and a half now,\" Quinn said Oct. 1. \"I think when you're first getting to know somebody, you're feeling that out, but knowing what his best looks like and also having trust in one another to do that. And so, I think that's a big piece of it.\"As difficult as this season has been -- Quinn responded \"Yes. Very.\" when asked if he was surprised about his team being 3-4, and injuries and poor performance have wreaked havoc -- Daniels' health remains No. 1.\nA 3-5 record, even with a brutal schedule ahead, isn't a death sentence, and Washington may have been 3-5 even if Daniels did play. Rushing Daniels back would be unwise, therefore, in the short term. If him missing a showdown with Patrick Mahomes is disappointing, imagine how disappointing it'd be if he played and aggravated the injury.In the medium term, there's still real experience to gain by having a healthy Daniels the rest of the season, even if it's not a playoff-bound season. You don't want this to be an injury that nags at him or carries over into the offseason. Washington needs to evaluate its roster to appropriately get the franchise back on course for the long term, and having Daniels an active part of that roster is crucial.In the long term, let's not forget what this team was. Last year, Washington became just the seventh team to win 12-plus games one season after winning four or fewer. All six previous teams had a worse record the next season.\nTeams to win 12+ games one season after winning 4 or fewerW-LNext season W-L1988 Bengals12-48-81999 Colts13-310-61999 Rams13-310-62005 Chargers12-49-72016 Cowboys13-39-72019 49ers13-36-102024 Commanders12-5???Four of the previous six teams would make or win a conference title in the next two years following their \"down\" year, the exact sort of year the Commanders might be in for. A fifth, the Cowboys of the past decade, has been a consistent contender.Progress in the NFL isn't always linear. The Commanders are finding that out the hard way. Last year, they broke through far earlier than anyone expected. They brought back many pieces of that puzzle and tried to fill in some missing pieces, but in general, it's a similar group to last year's, just slightly worse, significantly more injured, significantly less lucky and facing a significantly tougher schedule.Harris, Peters and Quinn always knew building Washington into a Super Bowl competitor was a big undertaking, one that wouldn't be complete in one year no matter the result. It doesn't look like it will be complete in two years, either. But the most important part of a Super Bowl contender -- a quarterback -- has to be the constant, year-in and year-out. By being safe with Daniels, the Commanders are ensuring that can be the case.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While Aaron Rodgers took extra delight in beating the Jets back in Week 1, the Steelers quarterback has made it clear that the same energy doesn't apply to Sunday's game against the Packers, his other former team that he enjoyed a tremendous amount of success with during their 18-year partnership. \"I don't have any animosity toward the organization,\" Rodgers said. \"Obviously, I wish that things have been better in our last year there, but I have a great relationship with a lot of people still in that organization, and this is not a revenge game for me. I'm just excited to see some of those guys and be on 'Sunday Night Football.'\" Rodgers has a profound appreciation for his time in Green Bay and the things he and the Packers were able to accomplish. He does, however, wish that their time together had ended differently. After the Packers drafted his eventual successor -- Jordan Love -- in 2020, Rodgers responded with back-to-back MVP seasons while playing elite level ball. You could argue that Rodgers' play during that span was better than any quarterback in history, including his former teammate Brett Favre's impeccable three-year run from 1995-97 that included three consecutive league MVP awards. \nRodgers' success correlated to team success for the Packers, who won the NFC North both years as well as home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In the playoffs, however, Green Bay suffered heartbreaking home playoff losses to the eventual champion Buccaneers and the 49ers (Rodgers' childhood team), respectively. In 2022, Rodgers played all year despite playing most of the year with a broken thumb in his right throwing hand. Despite Rodgers' injury and a 5-8 record, the Packers won three straight games to put themselves in position to make the playoffs with a win over the visiting Lions in Week 18. The Lions won, however, eliminating the Packers from postseason contention in what was ultimately Rodgers' final game at Lambeau Field. \"Obviously would have loved to ride off in the sunset,\" Rodgers said. \"That's not the way the league goes sometimes. And you know, I knew the writing was on the wall when Jordan was picked. ... I knew at some point there would be a change, and if I wanted to play, it probably have to be elsewhere. So I understand the situation.\" \nWith the Steelers, Rodgers is on pace to have his best season since 2021, when he won his fourth and most recent league MVP as a member of the Packers.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Rodgers' desire to continue playing has led to Sunday night's showdown between his new team and his former one. For both teams, Sunday is a chance to keep their pole positions in their respective divisions. For Rodgers, he has a chance to become only the fifth quarterback in NFL history to beat all 32 NFL teams.A few years ago, Rodgers may have relished the chance to make history against the Packers. Now, however, the 41-year-old is simply appreciative of the fact that he gets to share the field with the team that he will be forever linked to one last time. \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" he said. \"I have a lot of great memories from my time. There lot of great interactions with fans over the years. You know, living in Green Bay, living in Suamico, living in Hobart, going to Chives, being out and about, seeing people at the Piggly Wiggly and I'm shopping for groceries.\n\"I grew up there. I spent 18 years there, from (age) 21 to 39. So I'm thankful for my time there.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series will get underway on Friday night, when the Los Angeles Dodgers take on the Toronto Blue Jays. The Dodgers are looking to become MLB's first repeat champion in 25 years in what would serve as their third World Series win since 2020. The Blue Jays, conversely, are attempting to win their third title in franchise history, having previously won back-to-back championships in 1992-93.As part of CBS Sports' preview material, we asked our MLB staff for one bold prediction apiece. Do note that \"bold\" in this case does not mean something as (relatively) mundane as, say, Shohei Ohtani or Vladimir Guerrero Jr. recording a multi-homer game. No, these are supposed to be a little out there, a little aggressive. If you can't dream now, when can you?\nWith that in mind, let's have some fun together below.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2025 World Series bold predictionsR.J. Anderson: A walk-off ... caught stealing It's been 99 years since Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end a World Series on a busted hit-and-run play. Isn't baseball due for a sequel? Of course, neither of these teams is prone to running -- the Dodgers ranked 22nd in stolen bases during the regular season, the Blue Jays ranked 28th -- which is why I'll take this moment to remind everyone: \"bold\" is often another word for \"improbable.\" Maybe the Dodgers insert Justin Dean to pinch-run for Freddie Freeman or Will Smith, or maybe Toronto decides to send Myles Straw as part of a hit-and-run to leverage their high-contact ways. Whatever the case, my bold prediction is that one of the games in this series (and I hope there's seven in all) will end with a caught stealing.\nMike Axisa: The highest-scoring Fall Classic everI predict this will be one of the highest scoring World Series ever. It's two great offenses with a lot of power and also two shaky bullpens, which I figure means a lot of late-inning fireworks (good for impartial observers, bad for Blue Jays and Dodgers fans). Here are the highest scoring World Series:2002: 85 runs (Angels vs. Giants)1960: 82 runs (Pirates vs. Yankees)1997: 81 runs (Cleveland vs. Marlins)1993: 81 runs (Blue Jays vs. Phillies)1982: 72 runs (Brewers vs. Cardinals)The Dodgers' rotation could throw a wrench into this prediction, but that's what makes it bold, right? I think this will be only the fifth ever World Series with at least 80 runs scored between the two teams. If it goes the full seven games, that means we're talking at least 11.5 runs per game between the two teams.\n        \n            \n                World Series predictions: Expert picks for Dodgers vs. Blue Jays with MLB's Fall Classic finally set\n                \n                    Kate Feldman                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDayn Perry: The 27th out under further reviewI'll go with the MLB Doomsday Scenario being realized. By that I mean the final play of this World Series will be upheld on review. The result will be the same, but the celebration will be delayed while the review booth in New York has its look at things. The on-field call will stand as opposed to being confirmed, which will add a layer of ambiguity to it all. The awkwardness and the compromising of the championship moment will be subject to discourse and debate for much of the offseason in a most unwelcome manner. Ah well, such are the costs of doing business. \nMatt Snyder: A more conventional walk-offWe haven't had a walk-off clincher since 2001, when Luis Gonzalez singled up the middle against Mariano Rivera and the Yankees to seal the Diamondbacks' only World Series title. I've got the Dodgers in five, so let's say it happens again this year. In fact, of the 11 all-time series-clinching hits, only two have been home runs and I'll go with a third walk-off, World Series-clinching home run. Anyone remember the last one? Yep, it was the Blue Jays (Joe Carter in 1993; the other was Bill Mazeroski in 1960). This time, it'll come against the Blue Jays when the Dodgers walk the World Series off in Game 5 with a blast from Shohei Ohtani.\n            ",

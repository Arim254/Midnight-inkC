The Pacers have also covered in three of their last four games overall, and the teams hit the Over in their 126-119 matchup five weeks ago.Houston is without its best rebounder in Steven Adams, as well as Durant, who is one of the best wing shot blockers in the NBA. Meanwhile, Indiana ranks 25th in points allowed per game, so Houston should still be able to put lots of points on the scoreboard without the services of the four-time scoring champion. The model has the Over hitting with points to spare, with the total being eclipsed in 65.1% of simulations.It also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. So who wins Rockets vs. Pacers, and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time?

    "body": "\n        One of the top events on the PGA Tour tees off on Thursday as the 2026 WM Phoenix Open unfolds at TPC Scottsdale (Stadium Course). Known for its raucous crowds, the WM Phoenix Open usually draws a great field, and this year is no exception. Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Hideki Matsuyama are among the players teeing it up. They'll be joined by Brooks Koepka, who is playing his second event since rejoining the PGA Tour last week at the Farmers Insurance Open.The latest 2026 WM Phoenix Open odds list Scheffler as the +230 favorite (risk $100 to win $230), followed by Schauffele at +1700. Si Woo Kim and Cameron Young are at +2500. Koepka, who finished T56 last week, is +4500 this week. Before locking in any 2026 WM Phoenix Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, simulated every PGA Tour event 10,000 times and reveals golf betting picks that have a history of being extremely profitable. This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 WM Phoenix Open field is locked in, the model simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 WM Phoenix Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the WM Phoenix Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites, stumbles and barely cracks the top 10. He's a golfer to fade this week. The 30-year-old is off to a fast start this season, finishing T11 at the Sony Open, T6 at The American Express and T2 at the Farmers Insurance Open. This event has been a real struggle for him, however, as he's missed three of thee past five WM Phoenix Open cuts and hasn't finished better than 50th since 2022. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model is extremely high on Ben Griffin this week. He has only played this event twice, but he made the cut both times and finished 36th last year and 28th in 2024. Both times he shot above 70 in the first round, but rallied over the weekend, so if he can get off to a fast start at TPC Scottsdale this week, he'll have a chance to be in the mix on Sunday. See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $200 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 WM Phoenix Open picksThe model is also targeting three other longshots of +3000 or longer as top-10 contenders. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 WM Phoenix Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        The latest and greatest DraftKings promo code offers new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins, and there are multiple NBA games with postseason implications on Monday. The final one features the Los Angeles Clippers hosting the Philadelphia 76ers,at 10 p.m. ET with star power on both sides in L.A.'s James Harden and Kawhi Leonard and the 76ers' Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.  The Clippers are 17-4 over their last 21 games, giving the SportsLine Projection Model the confidence to include Los Angeles to cover as a 2.5-point favorite in its Monday NBA best bets at DraftKings. The over/under for Clippers vs. 76ers is 218.5 points. The model is also backing the Timberwolves to cover as 7.5-point favorites against the Grizzlies for Monday NBA picks. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has locked in a college basketball pick on Weber State vs. Sacramento State at 10 p.m. ET. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The SportsLine Projection Model simulates every NBA game 10,000 times and has returned well over $10,000 in betting profit for $100 players on its top-rated NBA picks over the past eight-plus seasons. The model enters Week 15 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 37-16 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Monday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookTimberwolves (-7.5) vs. GrizzliesClippers (-2.5) vs. 76ersSacramento State (+1.5) vs. Weber StateCombining the three picks into a Monday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +554 (risk $100 to win $554). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change)\nTimberwolves (-7.5) vs. Grizzlies (-115)The Timberwolves and Grizzlies are playing their second game in three days in Memphis, with Minnesota winning, 131-114, on Saturday. The Timberwolves have won four straight games, bouncing back from a five-game losing skid, and they are 31-19 on the season. Each of their most recent four wins has come by at least 12 points, winning by an average of 16.8 points per game. The Grizzlies (18-29) remain without Ja Morant (elbow), who could be traded this NBA Trade Deadline week, and they have lost six straight games. Each of their last four losses has come by at least eight points. Timberwolves stars Anthony Edwards (back) and Julius Randle (thumb) are questionable as injuries to watch, but the model still projects Minnesota to cover in 62% of simulations. Bet the Timberwolves to cover at DraftKings here:Clippers (-2.5) vs. 76ers (-105)The Clippers have been arguably the best team in the NBA since near Christmas, going 17-4 over their last 21 games after a 6-21 start to the season. They have won five straight and are 10-1 over their last 11 home games. Even with James Harden (personal) out on Sunday, the Clippers defeated the Suns, 117-93. Harden had 25 points and nine assists on Friday against Denver, and he's 16th in scoring (25.4 points per game) and third in assists (8.1). His being out in the front end of a Clippers back-to-back could raise his chances of playing Monday. Meanwhile, the 76ers go into this contest without star Paul George, who was hit with a 25-game suspension on Saturday for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy. The model projects the Clippers' winning ways to continue, projecting them to cover in 69% of simulations. Bet the Clippers at DraftKings here:Sacramento State (+1.5) vs. Weber State (-120)\"Familiar local face Mike Bibby had to throw out the blueprint for his first Sac State side when 6-11 UNLV transfer Bear Cherry went down with a leg injury in November. The Hornets, however, have made adjustments and sit mid-table in Big Sky into February after back-to-back wins over Montana State and Montana at the Nest,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"It's also worth noting those were only the third and fourth home games since Thanksgiving...all wins in Big Sky play. Bibby's transfer guards Prophet Johnson (via-Fairfield; 17.3 ppg) & Mikey Williams (via UCF; 16.9 ppg) combined for 45 ppg in those two wins. It's also revenge time for Sac State after Weber State got the Hornets in Ogden when hitting 51% from the floor on January 3.\" Bet Sacramento State at DraftKings here:\nWant more NBA and college basketball on Monday?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

Seattle loss its opener to San Francisco and fell to 3-2 after a Week 5 loss to Tampa Bay, but ripped off wins in 13 of the next 14 wins to earn its way into the Big Game. Meanwhile, New England lost two of its first three but has won 16 of its last 17.Sam Darnold and Drake Maye both looked like NFL MVP candidates at points throughout the season, though they'll likely fall short to Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Darnold has rejuvenated his career by throwing 60 touchdown passes in the last two seasons and Maye became the youngest player in NFL history to lead the league in completion percentage (72.0%).Both teams were top five in the NFL in scoring offense and scoring defense and the SportsLine Projection Model is predicting thin margins against the spread and with the over/under. It's slightly leaning towards Seattle to cover against the spread based on the percentages and also projects that the Under hits in 59% of its 10,000 simulations of the Big Game, higher than the implied odds of 52.2%.Exact score prediction: Seattle Seahawks 24, New England Patriots 20 (best odds +15000 at BetMGM):Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX. New England quarterback Drake Maye didn't practice on Friday due to an illness. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Seahawks are 11-9 all-time versus New England. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots   odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 45.5, with the Over slightly favored at -112 and the Under a -108.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

Barry Trotz announced his decision to step down from the post on Monday, and as majority owner Bill Haslam looks for a new general manager, he'll get some help from Nick Saban.Back in December, Saban purchased a minority stake in the Predators, and his knowledge about leadership will already come in handy. While the team will hire CAA to coordinate and contact candidates, the Predators will form a search committee, and Haslam said the group will get insights from Saban on \"building culture\" as they look at each candidate.\"We've hired CAA to coordinate the search for us. We have a search committed that I will lead, but Barry and [CEO Sean Henry] and Michelle Kennedy, our president will be on,\" Haslam said. \"... Nick Saban, who is our newest owner and has a little familiarity with winning organizations, has agreed to be on the committee as well.\"\nSaban may be retired from coaching, but he still wants to be involved with sports, and owning a share of the Predators allowed him to do that. In a statement from the announcement, Saban said he still has a \"competitive nature and a great passion for sports.\"If Nashville is going to rely on anyone outside the hockey world for this hire, it may as well be Saban. No other college football coach has more national championships than Saban's seven, and he developed Alabama into a perennial powerhouse over the course of his 17-year tenure. Under Saban, the Crimson Tide went 206-29-0 with six national titles.\nThe Predators, meanwhile, have been on a downward trend since winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2017-18. The team has missed the postseason in two of the last three years, and it hasn't won a playoff series in eight years. The next general manager will have to make some tough directions about the long-term future of a the franchise -- including whether a full rebuild will be required to restore the Predators to Stanley Cup contender status.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The phrase \"turning back the clock\" is such a backhanded compliment. From one side, it's laudatory, suggesting that a player is returning to the peak of his powers. But, from the other, it is a touch insulting, as if to suggest an athlete is no longer capable of performing at such a level on a consistent basis and that the moments in which he does should be cherished because they are fleeting.This weekend in sports, it was uttered ad nauseam. Turning back the clock, turning back the clock, turning back the clock. You would have thought it was the end of Daylight Savings! In reality, it was the Farmers Insurance Open in golf and the Australian Open in tennis where Justin Rose and Novak Djokovic, respectively, turned in vintage performances.On the golf side, Rose became the oldest winner (45) in the history of the Farmers Insurance Open this weekend. He won by seven strokes, led from start to finish and set the tournament scoring record at the 36-, 54- and 72-hole marks. The victory was his second in his last five starts on the PGA Tour dating back to last season.When asked about when the best golf of his career took place, Rose looked back through a few different windows: 2017 and into 2018 based on statistics, 2021 when he was the world No. 1 and won this tournament the first time and just last year at the Masters and the Ryder Cup based on specific round performances. \n\n        \n            \n                Scottie Scheffler primed to quell any lingering doubts over his dominance after full offseason of preparation\n                \n                    Patrick McDonald                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRose answered the question he was asked about the past, but it was not lost on him that the answer could still be in his future.\"I don't think I can work much harder, I think I just need to be patient with myself when the weeks slip by that aren't great and just know that it's still there,\" Rose said. \"Just know I'm pretty good at sort of gearing up for the weeks I want to play well, and I think having that sort of experience to do that. \"And obviously, yeah, listen, I'd love to find a way to play well every single week, but if I can kind of find a way to hone in on the weeks that I really want to play well, that would be enough for me to chase down some of the goals I have left in my career.\"\nHis performance at Torrey Pines showed as much could be true. The win pushed him to No. 3 in the Official World Golf Rankings behind only the aforementioned Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy. The latter thwarted his latest attempt to slip on the green jacket last April, while Schauffele -- then world No. 2 -- did the same in regards to raising the Claret Jug at Royal Troon to end 2024.Rose still holds onto his childhood dreams of winning all four major championships, though, despite only claiming the U.S. Open more than a decade ago. Then, he was a rising sun who was believed to be peaking, but then came the Olympic gold medal in 2016 and then the spurts of quality that he referenced.His peers then were Phil Mickelson, Henrik Stenson, Tiger Woods and others, rivals who much like Djovokic with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal now find themselves on the sidelines, for the most part. \nWhile counterparts and playing competitors have entered and exited the revolving door of professional golf, Rose hasn't. He has remained diligent with militant preparation. He has surrounded himself with a team to squeeze everything out of his game, his body and his mind in order to get the absolute most of his high-end play. Rose has blossomed while others his age have wilted. In doing so, he has proven that he isn't just turning back the clock every once in a while, he is showing you the current time.\n            ",

The next game will be held in Mexico City in December of 2026, although the teams that will compete in that game have yet to be announced.This marks the first time since 2022 that the NFL will play a regular season game in Mexico. Games were played at Estadio Banorte in 2005, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2022.\"We are delighted to bring regular‑season NFL games back to Mexico City beginning in 2026, reaffirming our deep and long‑standing connection with fans across the country,\" NFL Mexico director general Arturo Olivé said. \"Estadio Banorte has hosted some incredibly memorable moments in our international history, and returning here underscores our commitment to growing the sport at every level in the market.\"\nMexico was the site of the first ever regular season game outside of the United States and was referred to as \"Fútbol Americano.\" In that game, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the San Francisco 49ers, 31-14, at Estadio Azteca on Oct. 2, 2005. An NFL record 103,467 fans attended the matchup.London was the first city to hold NFL games as part of the International Series and was the only city involved in the program from 2007 to 2015. The league went from one game a season in London to multiple and in 2016 expanded to Mexico City, returning to Estadio Azteca.\nThe other international games in the 2026 season are in Melbourne, Australia; Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; Munich, Germany; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France and three games in London, England. \n            \n    ",

All the while, Rozier has been away from the Heat after being placed on unpaid leave after he was arrested. The NBPA filed a grievance for Rozier to be paid his salary, citing the necessary presumption of innoncence until proven guilty, which an arbitrator agreed with.\"We are pleased with the arbitrator's ruling and remain committed to ensuring that Terry's due process rights are protected and that he is afforded the presumption of innocence throughout this process,\" a NBPA spokesperson said.The Heat had been holding Rozier's payments in escrow, and will now pay him his full salary for the 2025-26 season -- or until a ruling is made on his case and it's determined whether he was guilty in the alleged betting scandal. \nThat ruling comes at an interesting time for the Heat, as they are considered one of the top potential suitors for Giannis Antetokounmpo ahead of the NBA's trade deadline on Thursday. Rozier's salary could be important filler in any deal, whether for Antetokounmpo or any other trade the Heat want to make. Because Rozier is an expiring salary, using his contract would allow the Heat some added flexibility in trade talks. His money will come off of the books after this season and would allow Miami to make an offer to the Bucks that could provide some much-needed cap relief for the Bucks. \nRozier's contract has counted against Miami's cap all season and has always been considered tradable, but the uncertainty of his situation given the charges against him made it feel a bit murky. The arbitrator's ruling in Rozier's favor could help provide clarity for teams perhaps unsure if a deal involving Rozier would clear at the league level. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar, who has been in search of an additional year of eligibility since the conclusion of the 2025 season, has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in Knox County Chancery Court. In his complaint, Aguilar seeks a temporary restraining order against the NCAA with the goal of obtaining an injunction that would allow him to play for the Volunteers in 2026.Aguilar is the latest athlete to sue the NCAA over its eligibility rules, and like the other cases, the Tennessee quarterback's complaint alleges that those rules deprive him of the opportunity to earn NIL compensation. Aguilar played two seasons of junior college football, which he argues should not count against his eligibility clock.\"If the Court granted Aguilar relief from the NCAA's JUCO rule in the near term, Tennessee has a spot for him on the roster and would welcome him back,\" the complaint says, per the Knoxville News Sentinel. \"His compensation for playing college football in 2026 would be approximately $2 million.\"If the court rules in Aguilar's favor, it would pave the way for him to join the Tennessee roster while awaiting a final ruling on the injunction. The 2026 season would be Aguilar's second with the Volunteers and fourth at the FBS level. He redshirted in 2019 at the City College of San Francisco, did not play in 2020 when the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, started five games at Diablo Valley College in 2021 and started six games the following year before making his Division I debut in 2023 at Appalachian State.\nAguilar will be 25 at the start of the 2026 campaign.There is no date set for Aguilar's hearing, but he seeks a speedy decision as he charts his path forward. The complaint states the need for a timely ruling in order to allow him to either return for spring practices or prepare for the NFL Draft.Aguilar was the SEC leader last season in passing yards per game and totaled 3,565 on the year, which placed him in third place in Tennessee single-season history. He passed for 24 touchdowns and ran for four more scores while guiding the Volunteers to an 8-5 record.Tennessee's offensive outlook hinges on Aguilar rulingAn injunction allowing Aguilar to spend one more year at Tennessee would likely raise the Volunteers' floor in 2026. The quarterback room in his absence lacks experience and would turn either to George MacIntyre or Faizon Brandon as its starter. Ryan Staub transferred in from Colorado but does not carry the same high-end upside as the former blue-chip recruits in the group.\nWith Aguilar under center, the Volunteers would benefit from both his experience as a fourth-year FBS starter and his familiarity with the offensive system. Any development between his first and second seasons in the program could help the Volunteers pull out of the SEC's middle tier and compete more strongly for a College Football Playoff berth.Diego Pavia case has implications for Aguilar, othersAguilar was initially a plaintiff in Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia's lawsuit against the NCAA, which challenges in federal court the legality of counting junior college seasons towards athlete's five-year eligibility clocks. He was granted voluntary dismissal from Pavia's suit and is thus no longer tied to the decision. The more than 25 plaintiffs in the Pavia case await a Feb. 10 hearing in which a judge will consider a preliminary injunction that halts the NCAA's junior college rule.If the federal court rules against Pavia and the other plaintiffs, Aguilar could still obtain his eligibility through his own lawsuit in state court. If it grants the injunction, further actions could bring additional eligibility to any former junior college player who has yet to play four years of Division I athletics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners are acquiring All-Star infielder/outfielder Brendan Donovan from the St. Louis Cardinals in a three-team trade that also involves the Tampa Bay Rays, ESPN reports. Switch-pitcher Jurrangelo Cijntje is headed back from Seattle to St. Louis and the Rays are expected to get third baseman Ben Williamson from the Mariners. The Cardinals will also receive 2023 first-round draft pick Tai Peete from the Mariners and outfielder Colton Ledbetter and a compensatory draft pick from the Rays. None of the involved clubs has yet announced the trade. Mariners receive: UTL Brendan DonovanRays receive: 3B Ben WilliamsonCardinals receive: SHP Jurrangelo Cijntje, OF Tai Peete, OF Colton Ledbetter, two compensatory draft picksDonovan, who's going into his age-29 season in 2026, is coming off his first career All-Star selection this past season. His best position is second base, and he can also man first, third, and left, and cover shortstop in limited doses. At the plate, Donovan put up an OPS+ of 119 this past season, and that figure is right in line with his career mark of 117 across parts of four MLB campaigns. Furthermore, there's cause to believe he may have found a higher level with the bat in 2025. Through the end of May, Donovan boasted a wOBA of .373 and backed it up with expected wOBA of .370. In June, though, an MRI on Donovan's ailing left toe turned up a sprained capsule in the joint. Donovan toughed it out, but the injury cascaded throughout his lower half, messed up his swing mechanics, and sapped his production. The Mariners are no doubt hoping he's able to rediscover and sustain that higher level moving forward. Donovan won't hit free agency until after the 2027 season.\n        \n            \n                Brendan Donovan trade grades: Mariners find obvious fit, Cardinals finish offseason teardown with biggest move\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe'll slot into a lineup that includes All-Star slugger Cal Raleigh, Julio Rodríguez, Josh Naylor and Randy Arozarena. The Mariners won the AL West in 2025 with a 90-72 record, three games ahead of the Houston Astros, before losing in the ALCS to the Toronto Blue Jays.From the Cardinals' standpoint, the trade of Donovan is in many ways the capstone on an offseason that's seen them commit fully to a rebuild under first-year president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom. Earlier in the winter, Bloom and the Cardinals in a pair of deals sent right-hander Sonny Gray and first baseman/former catcher Willson Contreras to the Red Sox and then offloaded veteran third baseman Nolan Arenado to the Diamondbacks. In each deal, the Cardinals added young pitching to an organization that prior to Bloom's takeover was starved for velocity and swing and miss. As well, ownership in each of those three deals included significant cash in order improve the return. That was especially the case in the Arenado swap. As for the Donovan trade, it not only adds young talent to an improving farm system but also fully clears the decks for top prospect JJ Wetherholt in 2026. He's now the favorite to open the 2026 season as the Cardinals' starting second baseman.\nCijntje, headlining the return for St. Louis, was Seattle's first-round pick in 2024. CBS Sports' R.J. Anderson recently ranked him the No. 7 prospect in the AL West, crediting a \"sneaky good right-handed fastball as well as a swing-and-miss breaker that ought to result in a middle-of-the-rotation future,\" but warned that his best future almost certainly involves pitching exclusively as a right-hander.Peete, also headed to the Cardinals, spent all of 2025 in High A, hitting .217/.288/.404 in 125 games.Williamson, headed south to the Rays, made his major-league debut in 2025, hitting .253/.294/.310 in 85 games for the Mariners.\nLedbetter hit .265/.337/.378 in Double A last season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Let's be honest,  Monday was one of the least interesting transfer deadline days that we can remember. No last minute deals, no dramatic races to beat the deadline that just missed, no drama. It was a disappointing day for fans of the soccer transfer deadlines as no big deals happened in the last day of business for teams around Europe. However, there are some reasons that can explain why it was such a boring day for agents, clubs and players. If the transfer of Ademola Lookman from Atalanta to Atletico Madrid was probably the biggest one of the day, many others just didn't happen. The transfer market has changed significantly in recent years, as the financial situations of many of Europe's biggest clubs no longer allow them to do the kind of business they would like. This is especially true in January, when clubs are increasingly reluctant to sign players on permanent deals, opting instead for short-term loans for the remainder of the season. But there are more reasons behind what has, or hasn't, happened on Monday. Early moves affected the businessThe Premier League's top teams are deeply affecting the transfer window around Europe. With their financial power, they can provide the kind of cash flowing into the other clubs that can start a transfer domino effect, but this wasn't the case in January 2026. Looking at the data provided by Transfermarkt, Premier League clubs have spent around $440 million during the current winter transfer window (the data will be updated after Monday's business) while during the 2025 winter transfer window they have spent around $600 million in just one month of transfer business. There is a difference but not that big to justify what happened on deadline day. This is why it was more about timing. Manchester City were among the most active big clubs in Europe during the winter transfer window. Pep Guardiola's side secured Antoine Semenyo from Crystal Palace for $88 million and Marc Guehi for $27 million but many others weren't as active as the Citizens, working mostly on loans and deals for the summer 2026, as Liverpool for example already secured Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes for the 2026-27 season. Elsewhere, things weren't busy at all. Big clubs in Germany, Spain and France barely made business while in the Italian Serie A only AS Roma and Atalanta were among the busiest teams of the window. While the Giallorossi signed Robinio Vaz from Olympique Marseille and Donyell Malen from Aston Villa, the team coached by Raffaele Palladino were able to sign Giacomo Raspadori from Atletico Madrid for around $35 million before selling Ademola Lookman to the Spanish team on deadline day. Juventus signed Jeremie Boga while Joao Mario was swapped with Emil Holm at Bologna. The Bianconeri failed to sign a striker after talks with multiple players such as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Youssef En-Nesyri, same as AC Milan that were looking for an additional striker after signing Niclas Füllkrug earlier in the window. Inter, the Serie A leaders, wanted a new right winger and after talks to sign Ivan Perisic and Moussa Diaby, none of them joined the team coached by Cristian Chivu. Antonio Conte's Napoli underwent a major overhaul earlier in January, with several key signings from the summer window leaving the club. Lorenzo Lucca joined Nottingham Forest, while Noa Lang moved to Galatasaray on loan, as Napoli brought in Giovane from Hellas Verona and Alisson from Sporting CP.\nThe biggest deadline day transfersAdemola Lookman to Atletico MadridIt was probably the most exciting transfer of the day across Europe as Atletico Madrid agreed to terms with Atalanta for the transfer of the Nigerian striker who will replace Giacomo Raspadori, who joined Atalanta few weeks ago. Lookman had been a key player under Gian Piero Gasperini at Atalanta, while also scoring an iconic hat trick in the 3-0 win against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2024 Europa League final. Lookman had disagreements with the Italian club last year when he was expected to leave Atalanta and join Inter. After several weeks of tension, during which he also refused to train with the team, the parties involved have now finally reached an agreement to bring their working relationship to an end.Karim Benzema to Al HilalThis transfer move was probably the biggest surprise of the week as Karim Benzema left Al-Ittihad and joined Al-Hilal on Monday in the Saudi Pro League, and will now play for the team coached by Simone Inzaghi that is currently leading the standings by one point on Al-Nassr. Benzema also had issues with his former club, which led to his departure during the winter transfer window. He is now set to make his first move since joining the Saudi Pro League in 2023 after leaving Real Madrid, where he became a soccer legend and played from 2009 to 2023. \n        \n            \n                Cristiano Ronaldo frustrations with PIF ownership of Al-Nassr grow as Karim Benzema secures Al-Hilal move\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTransfers that didn't happen Sandro Tonali to Arsenal While only a few transfers happened, many others didn't take place. Some of them due to the medical tests, such as Mateta who was set to join AC Milan during the last day of transfers, but then he didn't get the final green light from the doctors that the Rossoneri sent to London. There was some noise also around Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali, as Arsenal, according to Sky Germany, was interested to sign him on Deadline Day. However, both Arsenal and Newcastle had denied the rumours off the records while the agent of the Italian player Giuseppe Riso said to Sky Italy: \"We never had any conversation with Arsenal. Newcastle were never gonna let Tonali leave in January and we didn't even talk about it.\"\nRicardo Pepi to FulhamAnd lastly, one of the potentially key players of the United States men's national team. Ricardo Pepi was close to leaving PSV in the last 24 hours of the winter transfer window, but his move to Fulham was called off on Monday morning after the Dutch team couldn't find a replacement before the end of the window. Pepi will now remain at PSV until the end of the season, focusing on preparing for the 2026 World Cup. Sometimes the best moves are the ones that don't happen, and hopefully this will be the case for him and many others. \n        \n            \n                Why Ricardo Pepi's failed transfer to Fulham is a good thing for his career and the USMNT as World Cup nears\n                \n                    Chuck Booth                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n            ",

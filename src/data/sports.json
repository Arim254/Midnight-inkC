    "description": "\n        Two years ago, Texas A&M paid Jimbo Fisher more than $70 million to go away, the biggest buyout in the history of college football. On Sunday",
    "body": "\n        Two years ago, Texas A&M paid Jimbo Fisher more than $70 million to go away, the biggest buyout in the history of college football. On Sunday, Brian Kelly reportedly picked up the second-largest buyout ever.Those situations had one person in common: Scott Woodward. The LSU athletic director has a reputation of fishing for splashy hires. During his first stop at Washington, he lured Chris Petersen from Boise State. At Texas A&M, he landed the hire of the century by bringing national champion Fisher to College Station. And after taking the LSU job in 2019, he swung for the fences when he lured Brian Kelly from Notre Dame with a massive 10-year contract. Woodward is a poster child for winning the press conference, imposing his will and handing out some of the craziest contracts ever. But now, for the second time in three years, his obsession with swinging for the fences has a major athletic department reeling. And now, with the board and even governor of Louisiana getting involved, LSU should seriously consider whether Woodward deserves the chance to make a third mistaken hire. Let's turn the clock back to the 2021 coaching carousel for a moment. From the start, it was clear that Woodward -- a native son of Baton Rouge -- was saving his biggest moment for his alma mater. LSU was tied to then-Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, to the point that Riley even publicly said he would not go to Baton Rouge. He instead took the USC job. \nThen, it was trying to convince Fisher to go from Texas A&M to LSU. His interest earned Fisher a new monstrous extension -- so technically, not all $70 million in buyout money was Woodward's fault. From there, it was haphazardly big game hunting. Lane Kiffin. Mel Tucker. There was little consideration for taking shots like Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning or Texas A&M defensive coordinator Mike Elko. Hindsight is 20/20 on those candidates, but they're leading some of the best teams in college football in 2025. Finally, in Kelly, Woodward convinced a \"name\" to say yes. The Notre Dame coach was a career northern coach without any history recruiting the south. He was a ball coach and program builder with struggles recruiting at the highest level. In his mind, introducing the recruiting infrastructure would solve his greatest problems; there wasn't much consideration that he was a part of the issue. \nFrom the start, Kelly in the Deep South was a little bit of a joke. He became a meme when he tried to feign a Southern accent, and danced with a recruit. It was a strange look for the longtime coach at Notre Dame, one of the most straight laced programs in the sport. Kelly did have some quick success, leading the Tigers to a 2022 SEC West title and win over Alabama. But from there, cracks started forming in the foundation. In the past two years, the defense declined. When they invested heavily to fix it, the offensive line and running game collapsed. To the contrary, Marcus Freeman, the coach that replaced Kelly at Notre Dame, played for a national championship in 2025. No one in South Bend sweated losing the winningest coach in the history of the program. \nLSU under Kelly never reached serious national championship contention, despite putting elite resources into the 2025 recruiting class. The swing for the fences resulted in another strikeout, and a wildly expensive one at that. Even heading into Sunday, it was viewed as unlikely around the industry that Kelly's job was seriously on the line. Instead, Woodward pulled the plug after a disappointing 49-25 loss to No. 3 Texas A&M at Tiger Stadium that ended with \"Fire Kelly!\" chants across the venue. To be clear, there is value to taking swings and winning the press conference. It can galvanize fans and boosters, bringing much needed support -- financial and otherwise -- to the athletic department. \nBy hiring Petersen, Woodward resurrected Washington's athletic department, turning them into a national contender. Fisher also led Texas A&M to an Orange Bowl victory and AP top-five finish before he was unceremoniously canned. And even though the on-field product ultimately suffered, it galvanized Texas A&M into investing at the top of college football. But entering a competitive coaching market and new era of college football, LSU has to be smarter about managing its search. There are power players in Louisiana who would view the coach at Tulane, Jon Sumrall, as beneath them. They should not. Sumrall is one of the best coaches in America. Not giving him a full vetting would be malpractice. And furthermore, the magnetic power of individual coaches in the sport is waning. More important now is resource, infrastructure and administrative support. Indiana's hiring of Curt Cignetti spurred action, but their ascension to the top of the sport coincides with unprecedented investment in the program. To the contrary, LSU only re-entered the elite tier of player acquisition with the 2024-25 recruiting class. Will the next coach be given top 1% investment? That matters far more than whether you hand him a $12 million contract. \nIt's unclear at this point whether Woodward will lead the coaching search in 2025. Louisiana governor Jeff Landry has already made his voice heard. LSU does not have a permanent school president, only complicating the situation. And certainly, Woodward will feel personal pressure to clean up his mistake and deliver an even bigger result for his hometown program. But if LSU has not learned from Woodward's repeated mistakes, nothing will change. Don't worry about winning the press conference. Just hire a dang good coach. \n            ",

Elliott was ruled out for the remainder of the game with a knee injury. Per the NBC broadcast, Elliott was yelling and appeared to be in considerable pain as he exited the field and into the Steelers' locker room. \nThe 28-year-old Elliott is a major component of Pittsburgh's defense. A seven-year veteran, Elliott played so well last year -- his first with the Steelers -- that Pittsburgh inked him to a contract extension this past offseason. Last year, Elliott set career-highs with 108 tackles and three fumble recoveries while helping Pittsburgh clinch a playoff berth. \nThis year, Elliott has had an even bigger impact on Pittsburgh's secondary given the trade of fellow safety Minkah Fitzpatrick to Miami in exchange for fellow defensive back Jalen Ramsey and tight end Jonnu Smith. He missed two games earlier this year due to injury but had 21 tackles in Pittsburgh's last two games. Along with his productivity, Elliott is also Pittsburgh's chief communicator on the backend of the defense. That was surely one of the main reasons why the Steelers prioritized Elliott's contract extension this past offseason. \nElliott's absence would be critical to a Steelers' defense that has been inconsistent during the first half of the 2025 season. With that in mind, don't be surprised if Pittsburgh GM Omar Khan makes some calls prior to the Nov. 4 trade deadline as it relates to possibly adding reinforcements in the secondary. \n            \n    ",

I just pray that he gets healthy and comes back even better next year.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NFL trade deadline rumors: Cowboys made calls for both Maxx Crosby and Trey Hendrickson, but got rejected\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSkattebo was taken to a Philadelphia-area hospital during the game and was scheduled to undergo surgery Sunday night rather than return home with the team.\"I was devastated,\" rookie quarterback and good friend Jaxson Dart said. \"That's my boy. Seeing him go down and reacting to what happened, it sucks. It's the worst part of this game.\"\nTyrone Tracy Jr. is the next man up in the backfield and figures to return to the starting role he held at the beginning of the year, so long as Skattebo is on the shelf.\nSkattebo racked up 398 yards rushing and five touchdowns, along with 189 yards receiving and a score, across the first seven games of his career. He jumped into the starting lineup three weeks into the campaign and had been one of the Giants' top weapons ever since. His three-touchdown game against the Eagles on Oct. 9 was an early high point of what looks destined to be a prolific career.Skattebo was in the running for the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award but will undoubtedly fall out of the race now. He entered Week 8 with the seventh-best odds to win the honor, per FanDuel, at +3000.The outstanding debut campaign is part of an overall terrific year for NFL rookies. Skattebo led all rookies with 587 scrimmage yards through seven games and was one of three rookies to hit the 500-yard mark. Only one first-year player hit that threshold through seven weeks last season, in contrast.\nSkattebo looks like one of the biggest steals of the 2025 NFL Draft. He came off the board in the fourth round but outperformed every other rookie skill position player in total yardage prior to his injury. All-purpose stardom is nothing new for Skattebo, though. He made a late push last season for the Heisman Trophy at Arizona State and finished fifth in the award voting, and that came two years after he shined at Sacramento State as an FCS All-American.Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley, a former Giant, also weighed in on the injury. Barkley suffered his share of injuries during his time in New York.\"From everything I've heard, the type of person he is and how he comes to work through adversity and the mindset he has that got him to this point is going to help him get through it,\" Barkley, who tore his ACL playing for the Giants in 2020, said. \"He's a heck of a back. You could see just how the stadium felt because of the energy he brought. I know those [trainers] over there really well, and they helped me get back from my knee injury, so he's in great hands.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While he's one of the NFL's most positive head coaches, Bengals coach Zac Taylor was unable to mask his frustration following his defense's collapse that allowed the Jets to come from 15 points down to get their first win of the 2025 season. Ahead 31-15 after three quarters, the Bengals' defense surrendered three fourth-quarter touchdowns that included a touchdown pass from Jets running back Breece Hall en route to a stunning 39-38 defeat. For the game, Cincinnati's defense allowed over 500 yards to a New York offense that entered the game just 27th in the NFL in scoring. \"We just needed somebody to rise up and make a play,\" Taylor said afterward. \"Someone just hold the fort down. I just didn't see enough of that today.\"Taylor really put defense on notice seconds later when he was asked a follow-up about about the unit's ability (or inability) to overcome adversity. \n\"I think someone needs to step up and lead the group,\" Taylor said. \"That's what I'm waiting to see. Someone to step up and lead the group and take some accountability over there and get this thing going the right way.\"Cincinnati's defense has been the team's Achilles heel for over a year, and Sunday's meltdown may have been the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back in terms of Taylor's patience with the struggling unit. Last year, the Bengals' issues on defense cost Cincinnati a playoff berth while essentially wasting what was a banner year for quarterback Joe Burrow and receiver Ja'Marr Chase. Taylor acted accordingly, dismissing popular defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo (who is now in that same role with the 7-1 Colts) and replacing him with former Notre Dame defensive coordinator Al Golden. \nCincinnati has also made several personnel shifts that included releasing former starting linebacker Germaine Pratt this offseason and the recent benching of fellow inside linebacker Logan Wilson, who has subsequently requested a trade. Those changes, among others, haven't seemed to fix what continues to be a struggling unit. One of the biggest issues has been the Bengals' resistance to commit big money to that side of the ball. The defense hasn't been the same since they let safety Jessie Bates III depart via free agency back in 2023. Along with Bates, several other defensive leaders -- including fellow defensive backs Mike Hilton and Vonn Bell, defensive tackle D.J. Reader and defensive end Sam Hubbard -- are no longer with the team. \nCincinnati's inability to replace those players via the draft has also led to what's currently unfolding on the field. In 2022 and 2023, the Bengals drafted players -- defensive backs Dax Hill and DE Myles Murphy -- who they were hoping could eventually replace Bates and Trey Hendrickson or Wilson. Not only has not that happened, neither player has developed into a quality starter at this point in their careers. The Bengals appeared to draft a potential star a few years back in cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt, but he has regressed to the point where he too has found himself on the bench and out of the starting lineup this season. The team's best defensive player, Hendrickson, had been mired in an ongoing contract dispute that got exceptionally ugly this past offseason. While Hendrickson has played well this year, it's safe to wonder whether or not the ongoing contract issues have negatively impacted his ability to lead Cincinnati's defense. \nWith Burrow injured and likely out until at least mid-December, the Bengals, who are now 3-5 after Sunday's loss, have no margin for error if they are going to keep their playoff hopes alive until Burrow could possibly come back. They're certainly going to need better play from their defense, a unit that at this point is in desperate need of a leader. \"We just need some guys to step up,\" Taylor reiterated on Sunday. \"I'm not gonna sit here and name names. We just need guys to step up.\" \n            ",

Prior to that, Albernaz was major league field coordinator for the Guardians. In earlier years, Albernaz was bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants and also coached and managed at various levels within the Tampa Bay Rays farm system. As a player, the Massachusetts native spent parts of nine seasons in the minors as a catcher within the Rays and Detroit Tigers organizations. He reached as high as Triple-A. Albernaz inherits an Orioles team that still has a strong core of position players all in their twenties. However, the Orioles despite lots of talent finished a disappointing 75-87 this season and placed last in the American League East. Coming off consecutive postseason berths in 2023 and 2024, expectations were much higher. Those expectations cost manager Brandon Hyde his job in the middle of May. Interim replacement Tony Masolino managed a winning record over the remainder of the season (60-59), but ultimately lead decision-maker Mike Elias decided to go in another direction for dugout leadership. As such, the 2026 season brings with it a certain degree of pressure on both Elias and Albernaz to get the Orioles back into contending mode and win a playoff series for the first time in more than a decade. Elias' lack of aggressiveness in trading prospects for near-term roster needs and the lack of payroll investment from ownership remain impediments. \nNow that the Orioles are poised to name Albernaz to their post, the list of teams in need of managers for 2026 is down to five: the San Diego Padres, Atlanta Braves, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, and Minnesota Twins. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LSU is firing fourth-year coach Brian Kelly, the school announced Sunday evening. The move comes after the Tigers failed to deliver on high expectations in a disappointing 2025 season. The 64-year-old Kelly is in the midst of a 5-3 season in Baton Rouge. His buyout of $50-plus million will be the second most ever paid to a college football coach.   \"When Coach Kelly arrived at LSU four years ago, we had high hopes that he would lead us to multiple SEC and national championships during his time in Baton Rouge,\" LSU athletic director Scott Woodward said in a statement released by the school. \"Ultimately, the success at the level that LSU demands simply did not materialize, and I made the decision to make a change after last night's game. I am grateful for the ongoing consultations and support of the LSU Board of Supervisors and Interim President Matt Lee in this decision. We wish Coach Kelly and his family the very best in their future endeavors. We will continue to negotiate his separation and will work toward a path that is better for both parties.\"A contentious Sunday of meetings in Baton Rouge culminated in Kelly's exit. CBS Sports had previously reported that Kelly arrived at the football facility in the morning with the expectation making staff changes:Kelly, 64, arrived at the facility around 8:30-8:45 a.m. local time intent on evaluating his staff and, according to sources, exploring significant potential changes to the coaching staff. By early afternoon, though, after a meeting with Woodward that did not go well, according to sources, the conversation around Kelly's future began to change. Multiple staff members told CBS Sports that Kelly left the facility shortly thereafter.The day ends with Kelly's ousting. Running backs coach Frank Wilson will be the interim coach. A 15-day transfer portal window for LSU players will open five days after the Tigers hire their next coach. (the NCAA's single window for this cycle is Jan. 2-16). \nThe high-profile leadership change by Woodward, who made the splashy hire of Kelly in 2021, is the latest in what has already been a whirlwind of a coaching carousel cycle. LSU jumps toward the front of the line of programs seeking a home-run hire, along with Penn State, Florida, Virginia Tech and numerous others at the Power Four level. Woodward, by the way, is the same AD who hired Jimbo Fisher to Texas A&M -- setting the stage for Fisher to receive an all-time-rich $76.8 million buyout. Louisiana governor Jeff Landry was involved in the deliberations, sources told CBS Sports. Landry called out the football program after Saturday night's 49-25 loss to Texas A&M, tweeting that LSU needed to \"rethink their actions to raise ticket prices for next year after tonight's showing!\"Two of the highest-paid buyouts ever have occurred this month.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            With its sights set on reaching the College Football Playoff, LSU invested heavily in its roster through the transfer portal and loaded up on talent with the No. 1-ranked class in the cycle, per 247Sports. That recruiting push indicated LSU was all-in on competing for an SEC championship and its first CFP berth of the Kelly era. \nThe Tigers' defense improved significantly with the influx of instant-impact playmakers, but in a reversal from previous years, it was the offense that struggled to hold up its end of the bargain this season. LSU is averaging its fewest points per game since 2009 and its fewest yards per game since 2011. To fall short of lofty expectations, and to do so for a fourth time in as many years, was the final straw for Kelly to end his reign in Baton Rouge. The angst around the LSU program reached palpable levels with the Week 9 loss to No. 3 Texas A&M. Chants of \"Fire Kelly\" echoed throughout Tiger Stadium as LSU squandered a halftime lead and fell in blowout fashion to the Aggies in a 49-25 loss. LSU has a bye this weekend and then plays at rival Alabama. \nLSU's recruiting class for the 2026 cycle ranks No. 11 overall, per 247Sports. In 2025 the Bayou Bengals signed a No. 7 class that ranked higher before the decommitment from No. 1 recruit Bryce Underwood, who has started every game at QB for Michigan this fall. \nKelly's buyout ranks among the largest in college football. Programs have not been deterred by colossal buyouts in this hectic cycle, though, and LSU is the latest to eat a sizable chunk of money to make a change. The athletic department owes Kelly more than $52 million for parting ways with him during the season. The buyout calls for Kelly to receive 90% of the salary owed through the remainder of his contract, which measures $52,380,000 at season's end.   Most expensive buyouts in college football historyRankCoachSchoolBuyout1Jimbo FisherTexas A&M$76.8 million2Brian KellyLSU$53.8 million3James FranklinPenn State$49 million4Gus MalzahnAuburn$21.4 million5Billy NapierFlorida$21.2 million6Charlie WeisNotre Dame$18.9 million7Willie TaggartFlorida State$18 million8Ed OrgeronLSU$16.9 million9Tom AllenIndiana$15.5 million10Tom HermanTexas$15.4 millionBecause LSU fired Kelly in the middle of the campaign, it must also pay him 90% of the remaining $9.4 million salary owed for the 2025 season. Who's next at LSU?Any coaching search that Scott Woodward has his hands on should involve a slew of big-hitters. For better or worse, that's the type of hire he goes after. That's why names like Lane Kiffin and James Franklin are in the list of LSU's candidates, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Three major wild cards will draw attention, though.\nJimbo Fisher: I know suggesting Fisher here seems absurd. But remember it's Woodward who hired Fisher at Texas A&M and believed in him to such a degree he gave Fisher a historically lucrative contract to lure him from Florida State. Fisher's star has obviously dimmed. But Woodward actively pursued Fisher when he conducted LSU's search in 2021. Fisher has deep ties to LSU and is a national championship-winning coach. It's a marriage that makes a lot of sense if you can ignore Fisher's last two seasons in College Station.Dabo Swinney: Swinney is amid his worst season as Clemson's head coach since 2010. Could Woodward follow his Texas A&M playbook and lure a national champion to Baton Rouge? Swinney is a proven program builder and would seem to fit in at LSU culturally in a way Kelly never managed to. If Swinney wants a fresh start, you could pick much worse places than Baton Rouge to do so. But like Fisher, you must wonder if Swinney would be a sexy enough hire at this point in his career.Nick Saban: It was only earlier this week when Saban said, \"I want to stay retired.\" But if there was a non-Alabama job that could tempt Saban, it'd be LSU, the place he won his first national championship. Would he take the job if offered? Probably not. But Woodward's history tells you he'll at least ask.  Breakthrough season evades Brian Kelly LSU is a proud program with national championship expectations (its three prior coaches won one) and thus faced inherent risk when it hired Kelly ahead of the 2022 season. The longtime Notre Dame coach failed to get over the championship hump at his previous spot and only once reached the CFP. The same troubles followed him to LSU and were ultimately what spelled the end of his tenure. Never did the Tigers win more than nine regular-season games under Kelly's leadership. They generally hovered near SEC title contention but regularly fell just short, losing at least two conference games in each of Kelly's four years at the helm. Particularly frustrating for the Tiger faithful was to see the program fall short of championships despite a terrific run at the quarterback spot with Heisman Trophy-winner Jayden Daniels and future NFL Draft pick Garrett Nussmeier. LSU peaked at No. 3 in the AP Top 25 this season, reaching its highest ranking of the Kelly era. The Tigers climbed into the top 10 in each of his four years, indicating that they often came close to earning a playoff berth but had their hopes dashed by untimely losses. \n Brian Kelly faces crossroads in coaching career One of the biggest questions facing Kelly moving forward is whether he will seek a new job or hit the pause or stop buttons on his career. The 64-year-old may have his pick of multiple jobs given the widespread movement on the coaching carousel but could also emerge as a more attractive target in future cycles if he takes time off. If Kelly were to spend the 2026 season away from the sidelines, it would mark his first year without a head coaching job since 1990, before he made his debut. This is the first time in Kelly's career that he has been fired. He left each of his previous stops -- Grand Valley State, Central Michigan, Cincinnati and Notre Dame -- to accept offers elsewhere. Kelly went 34-14 at LSU and has a career mark of 297-109-2 spanning all of his five jobs. He won two Division II national championships at Grand Valley State and reached the BCS National Championship Game once during his Notre Dame tenure. \n2025 coaching carousel spinning at historic rateKelly is the 12th head coach fired this year and is the 10th in-season. The 10 coaches fired before November is the most in the FBS era (since 1978). Additionally, Kelly is the eighth power conference head coach fired this season. Only four of that variety were canned a year ago. The current number of eight -- and there's a ways to go -- is the most since 2022. LSU is top job available on coaching carouselPrior to Kelly, the three most recent LSU head coaches had all won national championships. That's why it has to top Florida for the best job on the market. As CBS Sports' Shehan Jeyarajah writes:\nThe program has recruited itself in the 21st Century thanks to its almost magical connection to the state of Louisiana, which ranks among the top talent-producing states in the country. Anything you can't find in the state, you can find a short jaunt away to Houston. Prior to Kelly, the last three coaches won national championships with the program. There are some mild questions about whether LSU is prepared to compete at the zenith of monetary investment across college football, but this is a job that doesn't just have championship upside -- they have championship expectations. 247Sports' Brandon Huffman likewise ranks LSU No. 1 among available jobs, saying \"even though the Sunshine State has more talent, LSU keeps whoever it wants home.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Brian Kelly era at LSU is over. The Tigers fired their fourth-year coach on Sunday, less than 24 hours after a 49-25 loss to Texas A&M.While negotiations are still ongoing between both parties, Kelly's contractual buyout of more than $50 million would be the second largest ever paid to a college football coach -- behind only Jimbo Fisher, who received more than $76 million after being fired by Texas A&M in November 2023.Kelly is due for a massive payout after signing a 10-year contract with LSU in 2021. His salary this season was $9.4 million, and he had six years and $58.2 million remaining on his deal, which ran through 2031. The buyout language in his contract calls for him to be paid 90% of his remaining salary, which totals $52,380,000.Three of the five largest buyouts in college football history have occurred during the 2025 season. The first major firing came when Penn State let go of James Franklin after losing to Northwestern earlier this month. Franklin's buyout ($49 million) ranks just behind Kelly's.\nA week later, Florida fired Billy Napier, who is set to receive more than $21 million after going 22-23 in his three-plus seasons. Napier finished 12-16 in SEC play and 0-14 against ranked opponents away from home.With Kelly out and LSU preparing for another coaching search, here's where his buyout ranks on the all-time list:And then you have Billy Napier, who was fired by Florida just over a week after Franklin. Napier is set to receive a buyout of over $21 million after he went 22-23 during his tenure. Napier finished 12-16 against SEC competition and was 0-14 against ranked opponents away from home.\nWith Kelly fired, and LSU set to embark on a coaching search in the near future, here is where his buyout ranks on the all-time list.\n        \n            \n                LSU coaching candidates: Lane Kiffin, Dabo Swinney among options on hot board to replace Brian Kelly\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Jimbo Fisher, Texas A&MBuyout: $76.8 millionNo college football coach has made more money from a firing than Fisher. When Texas A&M dismissed the former Florida State coach six seasons into his tenure, it wasn't a surprise. The Aggies were 6-4 in his final season. Their 9-1 record during the shortened 2020 COVID season was the high point of his tenure, but the program never reached the College Football Playoff.The Aggies took a risk by paying that much to make Fisher go away, but it appears to have paid off. Texas A&M is 8-0 and looks poised to clinch the first CFP berth in program history.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Brian Kelly, LSUBuyout: $53.8 millionWhen LSU hired Kelly away from Notre Dame during the wild 2021 coaching cycle, it was a bold move. The Tigers hoped he could restore them to national title contention. Two seasons before his arrival, LSU won a national title under Ed Orgeron.But the Kelly hire ultimately didn't justify the investment. LSU missed the CFP in each of his three full seasons and was on track to do so again after losing to Texas A&M. In retrospect, LSU likely regrets handing out such a massive contract for middling results.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. James Franklin, Penn StateBuyout: $49 millionPenn State entered 2025 with national title hopes after reaching the CFP for the first time in program history the year before. The Nittany Lions returned many of their top offensive players and opened the season ranked No. 2 behind Texas in the preseason AP Top 25.\nAfter consecutive losses to Oregon, UCLA and Northwestern, the administration had seen enough. Franklin went 104-45 during his tenure but consistently underperformed against ranked opponents.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Gus Malzahn, AuburnBuyout: $21.4 millionAuburn has been searching for stability since firing Malzahn in 2020. He went 68-35 overall, including 38-27 in SEC play.After a 6-4 finish in 2020, Auburn fired Malzahn and replaced him with Bryan Harsin, who lasted just 21 games. Current coach Hugh Freeze is on the hot seat, meaning the Tigers could be paying another buyout soon.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Billy Napier, FloridaBuyout: $21.2 millionNapier entered 2025 on the hot seat after narrowly surviving the previous season. Florida finished 8-5 in 2024 and had momentum with star quarterback DJ Lagway taking over full time.That optimism faded quickly. The Gators lost four of their first six games -- including to in-state rivals South Florida and Miami -- and were 3-4 when Napier was fired. Even after beating Mississippi State 23-21 to move to 2-2 in SEC play, the school decided to move on.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Charlie Weis, Notre DameBuyout: $18.9 millionNotre Dame fired Weis in 2009 after a 6-6 season. He went 35-27 overall, including a 10-win campaign in 2006.\nIronically, Notre Dame replaced Weis with Kelly, hiring him away from Cincinnati. After stints as an offensive coordinator with the Kansas City Chiefs and Florida, Weis became head coach at Kansas in 2012.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Willie Taggart, Florida StateBuyout: $18 millionTaggart's coaching career in the late 2010s was turbulent. He spent one season at Oregon in 2017 before leaving for Florida State, where he was fired after 21 games with a 9-12 record.FSU dismissed Taggart midseason in 2019 after a 4-5 start. The Seminoles also failed to reach a bowl game in his first year, going 5-7.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Ed Orgeron, LSUBuyout: $16.9 millionKelly isn't the only former LSU coach on this list. Orgeron led LSU to a national title in 2019 behind Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow but was fired less than two years later.Orgeron finished 51-20 at LSU, including back-to-back .500 seasons in 2020 and 2021. He hasn't coached since being let go nearly four years ago.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Tom Allen, IndianaBuyout: $15.5 millionSome programs regret paying large buyouts; Indiana probably doesn't. The Hoosiers fired Allen after going 33-49 overall, including 2023's 3-9 campaign.\nHis replacement, Curt Cignetti, has transformed the program. Indiana reached the CFP for the first time and is again in the hunt this season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Tom Herman, TexasBuyout: $15.4 millionAfter spending four seasons with Texas, Herman was fired by the program after the 2020 campaign. Herman finished his tenure with a 32-18 record, which included a 10-win season in 2018.Herman was replaced by Steve Sarkisian, who helped return the program back to national title contender status. The Longhorns have reached the CFP in each of the last two seasons under Sarkisian -- something the program wasn't able to do under Herman.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another week, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 8 has been chock-full of drama.Saquon Barkley finally rediscovered his big-play touch against -- who else? -- the New York Giants. The Cincinnati Bengals, who upset the Pittsburgh Steelers with a prime-time shootout back in Week 7, found themselves on the wrong end of a similarly high-scoring affair. The Drake Maye-led New England Patriots stayed hot to win their sixth game in eight weeks. And the Buffalo Bills got back on track with a major victory over the Carolina Panthers, who were without Bryce Young under center.Other surprises on Sunday: C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans enjoyed a splashy win over the San Francisco 49ers despite battling a slew of their own injuries, the Baltimore Ravens avoided a slide to 1-6 while awaiting Lamar Jackson's return, and the Atlanta Falcons stood no chance against the Miami Dolphins, even with Kirk Cousins getting a shot to lead the team off the bench.Which players, coaches and teams stood out as the biggest winners (or losers) of Week 8? Here goes:\nWinner: Jordan LoveOn the night his former mentor got to play host to an anticipated \"Sunday Night Football\" matchup, Love had a much more comfortable experience, launching the ball to the tune of 360 yards and three scores. He also got Grade-A help from tight end Tucker Kraft, who galloped all over the Pittsburgh Steelers defense to help spoil Aaron Rodgers' prime-time appearance.Loser: Mike TomlinThe Steelers coach got a solid and composed outing from Rodgers against the Packers, even taking a 16-7 lead into halftime of Sunday night's clash with Green Bay. What did he expect, Rodgers to also play defense? Tomlin's unit of specialty had no answers as the game wore on, leaving A-Rod to scratch and claw for hope in a two-score defeat, and dropping Pittsburgh to 4-3 on the year.Winner: Jonathan Taylor's MVP caseA year after Barkley cruised past the 2,000-yard mark, the Indianapolis Colts star is on pace for an almost equally dynamic season as the centerpiece of Shane Steichen's suddenly imposing attack. The veteran running back was averaging close to 17 yards per carry (!) just over halfway through a rout of the Tennessee Titans, and he's been money all year as Daniel Jones' offensive sidekick.\nLoser: Spencer RattlerThis isn't solely, or even primarily, because the young quarterback was unplayable as the New Orleans Saints' starter, but rather that he was basically set up to fail as the trial-run passer for Kellen Moore's rebuild. Speaking of Moore, he finally made the switch to rookie Tyler Shough against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, essentially turning the page on Rattler's scrappy, if unspectacular, run.\nWinner: Sean PaytonWhat a week for the Denver Broncos coach. Days after deflecting a rare Russell Wilson outburst, Payton didn't just stick it to the Dallas Cowboys, who apparently courted Payton multiple times over the course of his esteemed career; he outright embarrassed them, leading Bo Nix and Co. to a one-sided victory over a superior roster even with top defender Patrick Surtain II banged up.Loser: Dak PrescottThe Cowboys quarterback was understandably drawing MVP buzz coming into Week 8, consistently feeding CeeDee Lamb and/or George Pickens to help offset Dallas' porous defense. Then he ran into the Broncos defense, which made him look downright silly with two picks in a 44-24 blowout. The 'Boys wouldn't be near .500 without Dak, but this was an ugly day of decisions for the vet.\nWinner: Tyler HuntleyThe Baltimore Ravens got into trouble by improperly indicating Jackson might return from his hamstring injury against the Chicago Bears. But Huntley, who's now on his third stint with the club, stepped up in the former MVP's absence, completing his first nine throws and also scurrying for 50+ yards on the ground to help the Ravens snap a four-game slide and rout the Chicago Bears.Loser: Raheem MorrisA few weeks ago, Morris' Atlanta Falcons looked as if they might be on the verge of sneaking into the NFC South mix, showcasing a feisty defense in an upset of the Buffalo Bills. That \"D\" was nowhere to be found against the lowly Miami Dolphins, who rediscovered their aerial efficiency in a blowout win. Not even Bijan Robinson could save Atlanta's injury- and penalty-plagued offense, either.\n        \n            \n                The tush push didn't die in a meeting room; it died on a Sunday in Philadelphia\n                \n                    Jonathan Jones                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Jonathan Taylor's fellow big-money RBsStruggling to find green grass for much of 2025, reigning Offensive Player of the Year Barkley finally hit a home run against his old team, the New York Giants, as part of the Philadelphia Eagles' best rushing effort of the year. Meanwhile, James Cook, who just got a new deal with the Bills, exploded for 216 yards against the Carolina Panthers, and Baltimore's Derrick Henry scored twice.\nLoser: Everyone involved with the Bengals defenseZac Taylor runs the staff. Al Golden runs the defense. Higher-ups direct the roster. All of them must answer for the trainwreck that is Cincinnati's \"defense,\" which cost Joe Burrow a playoff run in 2024 and is about to make the team irrelevant again. Despite another valiant connection between Joe Flacco and Ja'Marr Chase, Cincy dropped to 3-5 by giving up 39 points to the New York Jets.Winner: Mike McDaniel's job securityFor another couple of weeks, at least. Tua Tagovailoa may or may not have the big-game fortitude necessary to keep the current Dolphins regime intact for the long haul. But the maligned quarterback finally found a rhythm under Mike McDaniel's direction against the Falcons to the tune of four scores and zero turnovers. Miami is still just 2-6, but this will quiet the wolves for a little bit longer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        EAST HARTFORD, Conn. – For U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes, much of the last year has been an exercise in planning for the long-term. She speaks frequently about how learning never stops for players and how teaching is her favorite part of the job, perfectly positioned to have as much information as possible by the time she has to lock in personnel and tactical choices for the 2027 Women's World Cup. It may be early in Hayes' reinvention of the USWNT, but in Sunday's 3-1 win over Portugal, she may have been witness to the biggest takeaway yet – the future just might be now.Whether or not it was in direct response to the team's 2-1 loss to Portugal just three days earlier, Hayes used her re-do to make eight changes to Thursday's lineup, her youth-skewing roster on full display. Ten of the starters combined for 100 caps while the 11th, center back Emily Sonnett, had 111 on her own before Sunday, allowing Hayes a chance to gauge a young group's evolution in comparison to losses to Japan and Brazil in the spring. That was especially true in midfield – out went the trio Sam Coffey, Lindsey Heaps and Rose Lavelle, the starters from the 2024 Olympic gold medal-winning team with an average age of 29, and in came Claire Hutton, Lily Yohannes and Olivia Moultrie, a trio with an average age of 19.The results were instant, with Moultrie scoring a brace in the opening 10 minutes of the game. Her second goal was especially emblematic of the difference between three days and an almost brand-new starting lineup. Yohannes noticed Jaedyn Shaw, another new starter, making a run towards goal and pinged a perfectly-placed long ball in her direction. Shaw needed a second touch on the ball after her first got away from her, but she quickly came through with a backheel pass to Moultrie, who found some space and slotted the ball cleanly into the bottom left corner of the net, making the most of their opportunities on the field.\n\"They performed like I expect them to perform. I rate them highly. I think they are the present and the future for the program,\" Hayes said after the game. \"That was a great step – positionally, tactically, technically, physically. I thought that was a higher level than six months ago.\"\nEven as Portugal's fifth-minute goal showcased some more room for improvement in the USWNT's defense and the attack did not generate as many chances on Sunday as it did on Thursday, the success of the U.S.' new-look midfield was the greatest takeaway as Hayes' learning period continues. In addition to Moultrie's brace, there was a fluidity that was apparent throughout the 90 minutes, even if Portugal's intensity dropped from Thursday's game to Sunday's. Yohannes was perhaps the biggest plus of all in the center of the park as the 18-year-old expertly noticed the teammates in front of her making runs, perfectly picking out passes to them to unlock meaningful goalscoring opportunities.\"I think we had much more control in this game,\" Yohannes said, a difference from the \"chaotic\" feeling of entering Thursday's game shortly before Portugal's game-winner. \"I think reviewing and talking about how we wanted to connect more, to be better in our structure and get the spacing and different things like that, that allowed us to connect better.\"Yohannes combined expertly with Moultrie, who took advantage of the opportunity in front of her as the battle for starting roles in midfield heats up. While the U.S. midfield failed to cover themselves in glory on Thursday, Lavelle was arguably one of the few bright spots with the team's only goal and a creative spark that led to some meaningful goalscoring chances. Moultrie announced herself with her performance on Sunday, her brace allowing the team to \"just come back with, I guess, a vengeance,\" and her chemistry with Yohannes in particular was a perfect response to the disjointed outing from Thursday.\n\"I love playing with Lily,\" Moultrie said. \"I think we think very similar on the field and just kind of being able to find each other in the pocket, play together, one-twos, I think that's what we want and I think just in general, our whole team, we really looked for that.\"The USWNT's youthful midfield feels like an early winner of Hayes' experimentation process and a much-needed one. The last year of tinkering was as hard a reset as the team has experienced in recent years but Thursday's outing offered a stark reminder that the USWNT's midfield was disjointed before Hayes showed up and was one of the team's areas of weakness during the gold medal run in Paris. A lack of rhythm in the center of the park generally drummed up a stilted attack, leading the U.S. to score just three goals in three knockout games along the way. With the Olympics trio, the USWNT did generate 16 shots on Thursday and 1.63 expected goals – a tally better than Sunday's 10 shots and one expected goal – but Hayes felt the team looked more connected in their second go around against Portgual than their first.\"I thought positionally, attacking-wise, we were much, much better in all phases of the field,\" the head coach said. \"I think it's a good lesson. The goal we conceded was an exact moment of not jumping out in the wrong moment, didn't quite get a detail right as we keep telling the players, at the highest level, those details matter so I have a coaching opportunity in and around the goal. It's all of it leading up to that but I think we responded well from that, kept playing, kept showing our principles, showed the control element that I felt was lacking in the last game and it was overall a much better performance.\"\nJust under two years before a World Cup, it would be hard to describe any player as a lock, nor is there any reason for Hayes to rush to her decisions. The head coach is still very quick to preach patience with her young players, well aware of the fact that growth is rarely linear. She issues praise and feedback in the same breath for player after player, a level-headed approach for a coach stewarding a group of players as they earn their first experiences on the international stage. Take, for example, her assessment of Yohannes, arguably the USWNT's brightest rising talent.\"She, like Claire Hutton, plays beyond her years,\" Hayes said. \"She has no fear to get on the ball with pressure, solve pressure, she can switch balls out, thread balls in behind. Still think there's a lot of work for her to do defensively for the team. At the highest level, you have to be really, really good. She still has work to do in that area, as do all of them. … I'm very, very happy she chose USA to play with because she's just going to be an important part of our team.\"Hayes takes her responsibility as the coach of a young player pool incredibly seriously, perhaps the lone consistency in a tenure that has required different things out of her at different times. Even as she rushed to prepare the team for the Olympics, forced to live in the short-term despite being hired to oversee the team's long-term vision, the head coach complained of an experience gap between the oldest and youngest players in the pool and argued her predecessors in the job were overly reliant on the veterans. She is taking the cautious and careful approach with a promising young group of players, no matter how impressive they are in the present.\n\"I still believe that it's going to be in Jordyn Bugg's, even in Claire Hutton's best interests that they're still playing in youth tournaments,\" Hayes said, using those two teenagers as an example. \"This is one of the things that top teams in the world do – if you're Spanish, you're German, you're English, you are playing in the U-17 World Cup, the U-20 World Cup and this for me, is of prime importance, that our players are playing in youth national team tournaments. If we are to stand any chance of competing because I think what everybody needs to understand is that in the rest of the world, over a four [year] cycle, the number of games players are playing is equal is one season more than players in the U.S. and so I have to close the gap.\"There have been many signs of progress for Hayes' in-development version of the USWNT, even if the work is far from over. The outing from the midfielders who started on Sunday, though, marks the most tangible sign of that progress and while the fact that they are the unfinished product encourages patience, there is also inherently a sense of optimism that the trio – and a host of their teammates – might only get better from here.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Aaron Rodgers will host his longtime former team when the Green Bay Packers (4-1-1) visit the Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2) on 'Sunday Night Football' in NFL Week 8. Rodgers and the Steelers should be extra motivated to get back into the win column following a 33-31 loss to Joe Flacco and the Cincinnati Bengals. Jordan Love and Packers will be a confident bunch, however, following their come-from-behind 27-23 victory against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 7. Green Bay receiver, Christian Watson, is set to return to the field for the first time since injuring his knee in Week 18 of last season.Kickoff from Acrisure Stadium is set for 8:20 p.m. ET. Green Bay is a 2.5-point favorite in the latest Packers vs. Steelers odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. The Packers are -151 money line favorites (risk $151 to win $100), while the Steelers are +126 underdogs (risk $100 to win $126).

Green Bay's run defense is allowing the second-fewest yards per game (76.5) and will aim to punish Pittsburgh's modest run game. Meanwhile, Love is averaging 8.2 yards per pass with a 69.3% completion rate and a 10-2 TD-INT ratio, so he should be eager to air the ball out against a Steelers defense that allowed Flacco to throw for 342 yards with three touchdowns. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Steelers can coverPittsburgh is 3-3-0 ATS on the season and 2-1-0 ATS at home, compared to Green Bay which is 2-4-0 ATS and has failed to cover as the betting favorite in four straight games. Rodgers has thrown for 1,270 yards through six games -- the fourth-most in the NFL -- and has a 14-5 TD-INT ratio following a four-touchdown outing against the Bengals. The T.J. Watt-led defense is allowing 374.7 total yards per game but has been good at forcing the opposition into making mistakes, and isn't likely to take its foot off the gas like Arizona's defense did against Green Bay in Week 7. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Steelers vs. Packers picksFor 'Sunday Night Football' in NFL Week 8, the model is leaning over the total, projecting 46 total points, and also says one side of the spread hits in well over 50% of simulations. See what it is at SportsLine.Who wins Packers vs. Steelers, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time?

Sugar Land police confirmed with the news station that Peterson was taken into custody around 9:30 a.m. and was charged with DWI and unlawful carrying of a weapon.Police did not release additional details about Peterson's arrest due to an active investigation, per reports. Fort Bend County jail records confirmed Peterson's arrest.Peterson, 40, was arrested earlier this year on similar DWI charges, just hours after leaving Minnesota's 2025 NFL Draft party. Peterson got into a fight with a man over a poker game earlier this summer and tried to cash in on the skirmish after signing a Celebrity Boxing contract, according to TMZ Sports, with his first fight coming against Joe \"Baby Joe\" Castaneda, the person at the center of the May brawl at JokerStars in Houston.No charges were filed from the fight and police were not involved. Video of the incident showed Peterson emerge with a bloody face, but he said the cut came from hitting a chair during the melee.\nPeterson lost his only other boxing match after he was knocked out in 2022 by former NFL running back Le'Veon Bell.The NFL's Rookie of the Year out of Oklahoma in 2007, Peterson rushed for 14,918 and 120 touchdowns over his 15-year career. He played his first 10 seasons in Minnesota before brief stints in New Orleans, Washington, Arizona, Detroit, Tennessee and Seattle. Peterson attempted a comeback following his final NFL season in 2021 after sitting out the 2022 season, but it didn't materialize. The former league MVP was 38 at the time and would've been the oldest running back to play in the NFL in the Super Bowl era, which stretches back to 1966. \nPeterson is from Palestine, Texas, which is three hours north of Sugar Land.\n            \n    ",

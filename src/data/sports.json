    "body": "\n        The Phoenix Suns have been one of the NBA's best stories this season, and Dillon Brooks has been at the heart of it. He's scoring at a rate (and in ways) we've never seen from him before on any kind of a consistent basis. He's defending, as always. His competitive prints are all over one of the grittiest teams in the league. And now he has a broken hand.There are bummers and there are bummers. This is the latter. Here's to hoping Brooks can get back in time for the playoffs/Play-In tournament (there is no timetable on his return yet, but ESPN reports that he'll be out an \"extended period\"), but in the meantime the Suns, who are also without Devin Booker (hip strain) for at least the next week, need to find a way to replace at least some of Brooks' 21 points per game. The natural next man for that job would be Jalen Green, who also came over from Houston with Brooks in the Kevin Durant trade. You're forgiven if you forgot Green even played for the Suns. He's missed most of the season with a hamstring issue that has refused to fully repair. But he's back and healthy (for) now. He had 26 points and four 3-pointers against San Antonio coming out of the All-Star break. On Saturday, he made up for a miserable shooting night by knocking down a fading corner 3 at the buzzer to beat the Magic in overtime. \nGreen is an electric athlete who had a legitimate superstar stretch last season in Houston, but he's never been a consistent shooter or anything close to an efficient scorer on the whole. He's only 24, but he's making $33.5 million. Next year that number rises to $36.2 million, and the year after that he has a $36 million player option as the first player to ever sign a 2+1 rookie extension on a nine-figure contract. It's a lot of money if Green doesn't pan out. But if he does, it has a chance to become a team-friendly deal. He's not going to defend like Brooks, if at all. He's not going to go to work in the post. But he'll never have a better opportunity to prove his value than right now, with the Suns badly in need of anyone who can contribute to the cause of recreating Brooks' production in the aggregate, particularly as a self creator. One of the notable strides Brooks has made this year is as a guy who can get buckets on his own; over 55% of his field goals have been unassisted. For better or worse, this is what Green does. Last season 63% of his non-garbage-time buckets were unassisted (that was the highest percentage for any wing in the league, per Cleaning the Glass). \nAgain, it's never been efficient. And so far it hasn't been with the Suns. On Sunday, Green cooked up a donut in the first half of Phoenix's loss to Portland and finished 1 of 7 from 3. So far this season he's averaging 13.3 points and shooting 38% from the field over 10 games. Small and randomized sample notwithstanding, that's obviously not going to cut it. \nBut don't be fooled, there is a big-time-scorer version of Jalen Green that is going to come out, and the Suns need it to be sooner than later. The dream of him turning into the actual superstar his talent theoretically suggests he could be is almost surely dead, but the question remains whether he can be winning player on a winning team. We've seen in in stretches, but the Rockets, all told, were more than eight points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor last season, per CTG. He's probably regarded as a negative asset at this point with $70 million in guaranteed money still on the books, but winning looks good on everyone. He's playing for another contract, be it in Phoenix or elsewhere. \nThese next six weeks aren't do-or-die for Green; he'll have a big opportunity next season, as well. But it has to start now. NBA perceptions can become sort of irreversible at some point, and Green is toeing that line as the dreaded empty-stats scorer. It just so happens that the Suns -- who are just two games back of the No. 6 Timberwolves with one head-to-head remaining and the tiebreaker already secured, but are also just two games up on the No. 8 Warriors -- are not in a position to consider any scoring stat empty without Brooks. They scored 77 points on Sunday. They need every bucket they can get. And if there's one thing Green can do, it's get buckets. \n            ",

It'll be the byproduct of the Blue Devils' 25-2 record that features a national-best 12 Quadrant 1 wins, zero losses outside of Q1 and a victory this weekend over last week's No. 1 -- Michigan.Incredible season, so far.As I noted on Sunday's episode of the Eye On College Basketball Podcast, the way Duke coach Jon Scheyer talked postgame, he seems to know, for the second straight season, that he has both the sport's best player and a team good enough to win the national title. Don't ever forget, even last year when Florida won the national championship, Duke finished No. 1 at KenPom.com behind the brilliance of CBS Sports National Player of the Year Cooper Flagg.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Houston's Monday night showdown at Kansas is critical for Cougars' No. 1 seed aspirations\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFlagg left Duke after one season and took his brilliance to the NBA. He's been replaced by Cameron Boozer, the leading candidate to be this season's CBS Sports National Player of the Year who has the Blue Devils with 25 wins through 27 games. Flagg's team won 24 of its first 27 games. When you add it all up, Duke is 53-5 in regular-season contests the past two seasons. That's incredible. But the truth is that, and this is my point, the Blue Devils fell short of expectations last season when they lost to Houston in the Final Four as a favorite and after leading by as many as 14 points, so now, in the end, it won't really matter how great of a regular season Duke has this season, if it's not followed by the type of NCAA Tournament run its great regular season suggests should follow, it'll be considered another disappointment in totality, fairly or unfairly.\nEither way, right now, the Blue Devils have the best body of work in the sport and remain No. 1 in Monday morning's updated CBS Sports Top 25 And 1 daily college basketball rankings. This week, Duke plays at Notre Dame on Tuesday before hosting Villanova on Saturday in a game that could decide the ACC's regular-season championship. Right now, Duke is 13-1 in the ACC; Virginia is 12-2. So if the Blue Devils beat Notre Dame on Tuesday while Virginia beats NC State, and then if Virginia backs that with a win at Duke, the two teams will be tied atop the ACC standings with 14-2 league records and just two regular-season games remaining.

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Heisman Trophy race is shaping up to be one of the most intriguing in recent memory, and it starts with the quarterbacks. That position class for the 2026 NFL Draft seems to be on the weaker side, which means much of the top talent remains in college -- and it shows. Suddenly, what might have been a straightforward race for the college football's best player looks wide open.There are 10 players currently listed on FanDuel Sportsbook with odds of +1600 or better to win the Heisman Trophy next season. Only one of these isn't a quarterback: Ohio State receiver Jeremiah Smith.What makes the upcoming season particularly compelling are the head-to-head opportunities sprinkled throughout the schedule. From early-season showdowns like Arch Manning and Texas taking on Ohio State, to late-November clashes that could make or break a candidacy, the contenders will have multiple chances to separate themselves in the eyes of voters.With so much talent and so many opportunities for one defining performance, the race will be as much about timing and narrative as it is about numbers. So, here's a look at the most pivotal game on the schedule for the top Heisman Trophy contenders in 2026.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    CJ Carr, QB, Notre Dame (+800)Pivotal game: at BYU (Oct. 17)Notre Dame is tied with Oklahoma for the most Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks (4), but hasn't produced one since John Huarte in 1964. CJ Carr sits atop the 2026 preseason odds and will need to maximize a schedule short on marquee spots. The rivalry showdown with Miami on Nov. 7 will draw plenty of attention, but the road trip to BYU two weeks prior feels more pivotal. In a tough environment, against quality competition, a decisive performance could provide the perfect boost to Carr's campaign that puts him firmly in the national conversation and sets the tone for back the half of the season.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Trinidad Chambliss, QB, Ole Miss (+800)Pivotal game: at Texas (Oct. 24)The early-season showdown with LSU -- now led by former Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin -- will generate plenty of buzz in September, but Chambliss' Heisman Trophy case is more likely to hinge on what happens deeper into SEC play. An October trip to Texas to face Arch Manning could be the swing moment. If Ole Miss reaches Austin with momentum, that matchup would open a demanding three-week stretch that could feature two top-five caliber opponents, with Georgia also looming back in Oxford on Nov. 7.\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss' injunction great for college football in 2026, problematic for sport's future\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arch Manning, QB, Texas (+950)Pivotal game: Ohio State (Sept. 12)Arch Manning's debut as Texas starter last season was underwhelming, a 14‑7 loss to Ohio State that left him trying to climb out of a hole he couldn't fully escape despite a strong late-season push. Now, another potential top-five matchup against the Buckeyes gives him a chance to rewrite the narrative. All eyes will be on Manning in Austin, and a standout performance that ends with a win this time could define Manning's early-season Heisman Trophy case and establish momentum that carries through the rest of a schedule heavy on nationally relevant matchups.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Josh Hoover, QB, Indiana (+1100)Pivotal game: Ohio State (Oct. 17)Week 8 of the 2026 college football season projects to be a loaded slate, with a rematch of the Big Ten Championship Game and the past two national title winners coming to Bloomington. It's the biggest game ever played at \"The Rock,\" with new transfer quarterback Josh Hoover set to lead Indiana against Ohio State. Last season, Fernando Mendoza essentially locked in his 2025 Heisman Trophy with his performance in a win over the Buckeyes. The Hoosiers will likely be 6‑0 heading into this clash, and Hoover could already be among the FBS leaders in passing stats. It's the first of back-to-back opportunities to make a statement, with a road trip to Michigan following the next week.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jeremiah Smith, WR, Ohio State (+1300)Pivotal game: Oregon (Nov. 7)Jeremiah Smith absolutely torched the Oregon defense the two times Ohio State faced them in 2024. He totaled 16 catches for 287 yards and three touchdowns, all in about seven quarters of action before not being targeted in the fourth quarter of a blowout CFP semifinal at the Rose Bowl. That kind of production makes him impossible to ignore, but winning the Heisman as a wide receiver is still a steep hill -- especially with quarterback Julian Sayin sharing the spotlight and stats. In fact, only twice in the past 28 years has a non-quarterback or non-running back claimed the prestigious award.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State (+1300)Pivotal game: at Indiana (Oct. 17)Julian Sayin enters 2026 as one of the frontrunners for the Heisman Trophy, and he won't have many quiet moments on the schedule. Of the 15 other quarterbacks with the best odds, he'll face five head-to-head this season, including potential top-five matchups that could define the race. A poor performance or even a loss won't derail his campaign, but strong showings in marquee games are essential. If Ohio State can beat Texas on the road in Week 2, it could set up a battle of unbeatens with the past two national champions when they visit Indiana -- a true statement game for Sayin's Heisman case.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dante Moore, QB, Oregon (+1300)Pivotal game: at Ohio State (Nov. 7)Dante Moore passed up a chance to be a top-five pick in the 2026 NFL Draft to return to Oregon, aiming to refine his game and lead the Ducks on a deeper postseason run. A Big Ten opener road trip to USC against quarterback Jayden Maiava will draw early attention, but November is what voters tend to remember. Recency bias is real in the Heisman Trophy race, and a late-season trip to Ohio State could carry far more weight. If Moore delivers in Columbus -- against a contender, in a hostile environment -- it could define his candidacy at the moment ballots begin to take shape.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Darian Mensah, QB, Miami (+1500)Pivotal game: at Notre Dame (Nov. 7)A November road trip to Notre Dame carries more national juice than any other game on Miami's schedule in 2026. Sure, an earlier test at Clemson shouldn't be overlooked, but the next chapter of the rivalry comes against the current national title favorites and Heisman frontrunner CJ Carr. When Cam Ward won the award two seasons ago, he consistently put up eye-popping numbers despite the Hurricanes taking a couple losses in the final few weeks.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Gunner Stockton, QB, Georgia (+1600)Pivotal game: at Alabama (Oct. 10)Only two Georgia quarterbacks have ever won in Tuscaloosa: Matthew Stafford (2007) and David Greene (2002). Neither was especially sharp -- both completed under 60% of their passes with two interceptions and two touchdowns -- but they escaped with narrow victories. If Gunner Stockton leads the Bulldogs to a win against Alabama this season, it would mark a defining road statement for Georgia and immediately elevate his Heisman Trophy stock entering the back half of the schedule.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Sam Leavitt, QB, LSU (+1600)Pivotal game: Alabama (Nov. 7)Similar to Ohio State, Alabama is the kind of program that draws national attention, and the matchup with the Crimson Tide could fall at a perfect point for LSU and new quarterback Sam Leavitt. Lane Kiffin put everything on the table to bring the Arizona State transfer to Baton Rouge, and a strong performance against Alabama would give Leavitt the signature moment voters remember in a Heisman Trophy campaign.\n            ",

The league announced her death Sunday night. No cause of death has been released.\"It is with profound sadness that we mourn the passing of 2x WNBA Champion Kara Braxton,\" the WNBA said on social media. \"A 10-season veteran, Kara played with the Detroit Shock, Tulsa Shock, Phoenix Mercury, and New York Liberty. Our thoughts are with her family, friends, and former teammates at this time.\"Braxton was the No. 7 overall pick in the 2005 WNBA Draft and spent the first five and a half years of her professional career with the Detroit/Tulsa Shock. She earned a spot on the WNBA's All-Rookie team after she averaged 6.9 points and 3.0 rebounds per game off the bench. Braxton won both of her WNBA championships with the Shock, the first in 2006 and the second in 2008. She started nine playoff games during the latter campaign to make the greatest postseason contributions of her career.The most productive stint of Braxton's career came across the 2010 and 2011 seasons when she spent half of both campaigns with the Mercury. She averaged 11.1 points across 13 games in Phoenix the first year and 10.6 points across 18 starts the following season.A three-and-a-half-year run with the Liberty brought Braxton's career to a close. She took on her largest role to date in 2013 -- her penultimate year in the league -- as a 33-game starter. The 6.6 rebounds she logged that year were a personal best. The Liberty waived her early in the 2014 season.Braxton and her twin sister, Kim, moved from Michigan to Oregon in 1997. They attended Westview High School in Portland, where Kara won the Oregon Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior. The twins signed with Georgia to play college basketball, and Kara won the SEC Freshman of the Year award in 2002 after posting 16.3 points per game as a first-year standout. She was dismissed from the team in February 2004.Braxton is survived by her husband, Jarvis Jackson, and sons Jelani Thurman and Jream Jackson. Thurman is a college football tight end who transferred this winter from Ohio State to North Carolina and who won the 2024 national championship with the Buckeyes.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        A little over a month ago, I gave you my first look at breakouts for 2026.    Since then, there have been trades, signings, and injuries galore. Players have reported to camp promising changes, and some have demonstrated them in games already. I've also had a chance to sharpen my insights through more drafting and research.    Sleepers 2.0: Scott | Chris | FrankBreakouts 2.0: Scott | Chris | FrankBusts 2.0: Scott | Chris | FrankBottom line is it's time for a refresh, so that's what I've provided here, introducing about a half a dozen new names (The Newcomers) before revisiting some of my earlier choices (The Holdovers), most of which still apply.    As a reminder, breakouts are players who I'm expecting to be better than they've ever been before, while sleepers are players who I think are being overlooked. But breakouts can be overlooked, too!    Note that ADP comes from FantasyPros, which averages data from multiple platforms.

It wasn't a perfect stat line, but it was the perfect start for what had been a can't-miss pitching prospect up to that point -- one buoyed by three pitches with a 45 percent whiff rate or better.    But then came the surgery and the long recovery and a return that wasn't without its glitches.     A rough stretch from early August to early September condemned Perez to an ERA over 4.00 and represented his first real blemishes performance-wise. I like to focus on what came after, though. His final four starts (spanning 20 innings) were as ace-like as you'll ever see, yielding 33 strikeouts to just four walks and a swinging-strike rate (16.1 percent) that would have ranked second among qualifiers. His ERA during that stretch was 2.70. His FIP was 1.09.    It was a small sample, but it was more befitting of the Perez we remember. Whether a small mechanical change is to credit or simply the slow regaining of command following Tommy John surgery, it served as a reminder of the pitcher Perez promises to be, and I'd hate to back away when he's closer than ever to meeting that promise. I'm betting this is the year he grows fully into an ace, making it also your last chance to draft him as anything less.    \n    Nick Lodolo, SP, Reds    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Cincinnati\n                    \n                                            • #40\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    9-8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.33\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.08\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    156.2\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    31\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    156\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nFantasyPros ADP: 131.8    You may argue Lodolo just had his best season, and that's true. He was  the healthiest he's ever been, missing only a couple weeks in August  with a blister on his finger, and delivered career bests in ERA and  WHIP. I see reason to believe he has another gear, though, and he in fact showed  it to us down the stretch.      As impressive as Lodolo's final line was, he disappointed in a couple areas, the main one being that he struck out just one batter per inning. That's a full K/9 lower than his career mark. If you look at his game log, though, you'll notice the leap he made over his final 12 appearances, registering 10.3 K/9. Even more impressive, though, was the swinging-strike rate, which climbed to 15.7 percent as compared to 10.4 percent in his previous 17 starts. Just how high is 15.7 percent? Only one pitcher with a minimum of 100 innings eclipsed it, and his name was Tarik Skubal.    During that dominant stretch, Lodolo continually upped his curveball usage, and it remains a uniquely dominant pitch. You might think that relying on one with so much movement would compromise Lodolo's control, but instead, his 4.8 percent walk rate ranked in the 95th percentile, accounting for just 1.8 walks per nine innings. That sort of control, combined with the bat-missing ability he showed down the stretch, makes for a ceiling that his 2025, for as good as it was, could only hint at.    \n    Gabriel Moreno, C, Diamondbacks    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #14\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 26\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .285\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    9\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    40\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    44\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        OPS\n                                    \n                                    .786\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AB\n                                    \n                                    277\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nFantasyPros ADP: 231.6    Catcher is so abounding in talent that you may not think a retread like Moreno is deserving of your time. But the 26-year-old just set a career high with nine home runs despite playing in only 83 games and made the one change that might go the furthest to maximizing his outlook. He has always had a knack for putting bat to ball, and that contact has also been of a high enough quality to yield favorable batting averages. But despite strong exit velocity readings, Moreno's inability to elevate the ball greatly limited his home run output.    Last year, he set a career high with a 37.6 percent fly-ball rate, and it jumped to 44 percent after he returned from a fractured finger Aug. 22. He batted .311 (32 for 103) with four homers and  an .862 OPS in those 30 games. That's not a massive home run pace, but if he can approach 15-20 in a season, with everything else he brings to the table as a hitter, he starts to look a bit like William Contreras for Fantasy. Again, Moreno is hardly alone as far as upside catcher targets go, but he deserves to be mentioned among them, particularly in two-catcher and Head-to-Head points leagues.

The seventh pick in the 2024 draft had made quick work of the upper minors, actually improving his numbers with a midseason move up to Triple-A, and was also expanding his versatility with starts at third and second base, the two positions where he had the easiest \"in.\" Why not let him get his feet wet for 2025?    \nWe may never know the answer to that, but we do know that the Cardinals are now completely ready to bring him into the fold. We know because of the way they navigated this offseason, first unloading third baseman Nolan Arenado to the Diamondbacks and then dealing second baseman Brendan Donovan to the Mariners. Even if you wanted to make the case that Nolan Gorman should have first dibs at the next opening, it's a moot point. The Cardinals cleared spots for Gorman and Wetherholt both.    Of course, Wetherholt will be eligible only at shortstop to start out, but whether he ultimately latches on at third base or, more likely, second, he'll soon be playable at a position starved for high-end talent. No one can say for sure how he'll perform as a rookie, but generally, the prospects who meet no resistance on their way to the big leagues have the smoothest transitions. Wetherholt's 1-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio serves as another indicator of his polish, and while he could stand to put the ball in the air more, it clearly didn't compromise his home run output. With the potential to contribute in all five Rotisserie categories and the plate discipline to excel in points leagues as well, Wetherholt could emerge as a top-five second baseman in either format as soon as this year.

He's now four years removed from the 1.56 ERA, 0.89 WHIP, and 13.5 K/9 that put him on the map as a 19-year-old, and his return from Tommy John surgery last year couldn't have gone much worse. Instead of reaching the majors midseason after a quick buildup, he remained mired at Triple-A, putting up the pitiful numbers you see before you. What you won't see in the numbers, though, is the fairly obvious mechanical glitch that was responsible for them.    \nPainter's arm slot had dropped, according to Matt Gelb of The Athletic, and with it, the carry on his fastball was gone. \"That was bread and butter,\" Painter said. \"So pitching without that last year was very tough.\" It wasn't just this one report that made reference to it, either. Baseball America highlighted the same thing in its write-up of Painter this offseason. And you can understand why it happened. Painter's old mechanics didn't just lock into place after surgery. He had to refamiliarize himself with his pitching motion and may have gotten it just a little wrong. The change not only undermined the fastball's effectiveness but also caused it to move in ways Painter wasn't familiar with, compromising his command.     But his old arm slot is back now. He worked with assistant coach Mark Lowy at Cressey Sports Performance facility in Florida to regain it. Pitching coach Caleb Cotham has confirmed it \"looks significantly different than this time last year,\" and manager Rob Thomson has noticed that the command is back. Painter also has surprising job security for having never thrown a pitch in the majors. With Ranger Suarez departing via free agency and Zack Wheeler expected to begin the year on the IL, there's nowhere else for the Phillies to turn, but Painter, and the fact they put themselves in that position shows just how much confidence they have in the 22-year-old.     Prospect evaluators may not have moved on, but Fantasy Baseballers seemingly have. At long last, Painter's potential is soon to be realized, so you'll want to make him a central part of your late-round plans.    \n    Michael Burrows, SP, Astros    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #50\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 26\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        W-L\n                                    \n                                    2-4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        ERA\n                                    \n                                    3.94\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        WHIP\n                                    \n                                    1.24\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INN\n                                    \n                                    96\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        BB\n                                    \n                                    31\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        K\n                                    \n                                    97\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \nFantasyPros ADP: 331.2    Burrows had a pretty good rookie season for the Pirates, as you can see from the numbers above, but two things held him back. One is that his outings tended to run short, with only two reaching the six-inning threshold. The other is that, even as a right-handed pitcher, he struggled to put away right-handed hitters, allowing a .258 batting average and .748 OPS against them. The two are possibly related. Burrows' numbers the second time through the batting order were much worse than the first time, and if a particular handedness of hitter was picking up on him well, it would be all the more true a second time through.    The Astros deliberately targeted him this offseason because they saw first-hand what he could do when he shut them out over 5 1/3 innings on June 4. They also saw \"a few things that maybe we could do to even get him to the next level,\" in the words of GM Dana Brown. Like what? Well, we saw what in his spring debut Sunday against the Cardinals. Leading with a two-seamer that he threw 25 percent of the time, he registered seven swinging strikes on just 24 pitches. He hardly threw the two-seamer last year, but the Astros believe it's the key to him succeeding against right-handed batters. According to Brian McTaggart of MLB.com, they made a similar adjustment with Hunter Brown in 2024, and he has more or less been an ace since.    Burrows isn't Brown, most likely. He doesn't induce as much weak contact and doesn't put the ball on the ground as often. But he's arguably the better bat-misser, led by a changeup that registered a 43 percent whiff rate last year. Now that he's in an organization that knows how to maximize his tool set -- and sought him out just to do that -- he's well worth a late-round target.    \n    THE HOLDOVERS           Ben Rice, C/1B, Yankees       \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYY\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

In fact, recent NFBC drafts have him going inside the top 50, which is verging on prohibitive. If, however, I'm your only source of Fantasy Baseball inspiration or you play in a league that doesn't get swept away in the latest trends, the case deserves to be made. So I'll make it a la Andrew Lincoln with his cue cards: standing out in the cold, with little hope of being let in.       To me, Rice is perfect. You may wonder why I'd call him a breakout when he already put himself on the map with an unexpected 26-homer season, but as promising as his .255 batting average and .499 slugging percentage in 2025 were, the Statcast readings say he deserved better. How much better? Try a .283 batting average and .557 slugging percentage, the latter of which was topped by only five qualifying batters: Aaron Judge, Shohei Ohtani, Cal Raleigh, Kyle Schwarber, and George Springer. Rice's 93.3 mph average exit velocity was 95th percentile, akin to Fernando Tatis. His strikeout rate was under 20 percent, giving him better bat-to-ball skills than the typical slugger. And while many a high-impact hitter has been dragged down by the angle the ball takes off his bat, Rice's pull-air rate was over 25 percent, putting him in the top 10 percent of the league.        He bats left-handed, by the way, which means that when he's at home, all of those balls that he's pulling in the air are hurtling toward the famous short porch in baseball. And did I mention he's a catcher for Fantasy Baseball purposes? He's the best type of catcher, too: one who's not expected to catch much, if at all. This gives him a playing time advantage over the true catchers, particularly with manager Aaron Boone having already confirmed Rice will play \"a lot\" vs. lefties.       \nSure, no one much cared about him prior to last year, which is not a typical trajectory for a player who just turned 27, but if you look back on the minor league history, Rice was rocking it there as well. The deeper you dig, the better it gets, so I can understand why you may have to forfeit a top-50 pick to get him. I'm just too risk-averse to take him ahead of longstanding studs like Matt Olson and Rafael Devers.

That's what I've deduced by the way even the most seasoned baseball writers, Fantasy or otherwise, talk about him. So I guess I'll play along and act like it'll be some great surprise when he competes for a Cy Young (again), which he absolutely will if he stays healthy.       Health is, of course, the reason why he's something of a forgotten man, to the degree that he is. He missed most of the 2024 and 2025 seasons due to Tommy John surgery. But consider that over his past 44 starts, beginning with that down-ballot Cy Young season, he has a 2.78 ERA, 1.05 WHIP, and 10.1 K/9. That K/9 rate jumped to 13.2 in the six starts after returning from Tommy John in 2025, which would have ranked first by nearly 1.5 strikeouts among pitchers with at least 100 innings. Even with the long layoff and difficult recovery, Bradish has continued to get better.       \nThe improvement in swinging-strike rate post-surgery was even starker. His walk rate was the best it's ever been, and his fastball had more carry than ever. He even managed to go six-plus innings in three of his six starts back from the injury. By virtually every indicator, Bradish is an ace, and seeing as the Orioles didn't make a play for another one this offseason, they would seem to view him the same way.

The comparison is a misleading one because Rice made 18 appearances off the bench, sometimes without getting even an at-bat, while Ramirez made only four, but even if you compare Ramirez to Hunter Goodman (2.82) and William Contreras (2.84), he still comes out looking better than you might expect. And that's with him hitting just .231 and slugging just .413. Statcast suggests he should have hit .259 and slugged .457.       Yet again, we have a catcher-eligible player whose expected production far exceeded his actual production, and in a way that's not easily disregarded. Ramirez's pull-air rate wasn't as high as Rice's, but it was still in the upper half of the league. Maybe he wasted some of his hardest contact by hitting it to the wrong part of the field, but judging by his overall batted-ball trends, it shouldn't be a chronic problem. His 19.3 percent swinging-strike rate was especially impressive for a rookie who hit a ball as hard as 116.9 mph -- a mark topped by only 12 players last year -- and even though he didn't arrive until about a month into the season, his 16 stolen bases led all catchers.       That position has seen a massive influx of talent in recent years, to the point that it feels like you can do no wrong in a one-catcher league, but Ramirez brings a couple of additional elements, from the stolen bases to the additional DH at-bats, which are all the more attractive when you factor in that he left some meat on the bone as a hitter. If any of the recent breakthrough catchers is going to take that next step into studliness, it's him.

And to a certain degree, I get it. At the time of his promotion last June, he had emerged as the top pitching prospect in baseball just a year after being the highest drafted, so expectations were through the roof. But then he pitched to a 5.24 ERA, missed a month with a flexor strain, and returned to work 1-2 innings at a time out of the bullpen. Hard to characterize that particular stint as anything more than a flop.       Or was it? The final ERA, though an uninspiring 4.57, was belied by a 3.44 xERA and 2.65 FIP. The stuff was knock-your-socks-off good. Among pitchers with at least 100 innings, no one had higher than an 11.9 K/9 rate. Burns' was 13.9. Among that same selection of pitchers, only one, Tarik Skubal, had a higher swinging-strike rate than Burns' 15.8 percent. Those are some of the plainest indicators of pitching dominance, and he measured up to, or even exceeded, the giants. Perhaps the clearest example of this is that over the eight starts he made in his first big league stint, Burns recorded double-digit strikeouts four times. That's more than Paul Skenes has done it in his entire career, spanning 55 starts in all.       Yeah, he's going to be a good one.

But not everyone is onto Williams, at least not at this stage of his development. More likely, you'll see him touted as a bust, given that he had a 3.06 ERA compared to a 4.28 xERA and 4.08 xFIP. Why the departure for me? Having watched him intently last year, waiting, like every other analytically minded person, for the other shoe to drop, I instead saw him launched into the stratosphere, not just with a 2.18 ERA, 1.05 WHIP and 10.0 K/9 in the second half but, more convincingly, with a 1.74 ERA, 1.06 WHIP and 11.0 K/9 in his final five starts. The 61 percent strike rate and 11 percent swinging-strike rate that were so ordinary prior to then jumped to 66 percent and 14 percent in those five starts, which are the kind of numbers that should have everyone salivating.       The key to the turnaround was an increased reliance on his two-seamer, the same adjustment that's gotten so much attention for Edward Cabrera and seems to have worked the same wonders, just over a shorter stretch, for Williams, consistently putting him ahead in the count to allow his nastier pitches to wreak havoc.        Now 26, Williams was one of the most celebrated pitching prospects throughout his time in the minors, renowned above all for his electric arsenal. For him to lose footing in Fantasy right when he's showing his clearest signs of progress seems backward to me.

And then came 2025, which was a roller coaster ride all its own. If you had asked me on Aug. 24, when he was hitting .300 with an .856 OPS, whether he'd be a breakout candidate for me, I would have said \"no, he's already broken out.\" What I couldn't have known then, though, was that he'd go on to hit .193 with a .549 OPS over his final 29 games, striking out 33 percent of the time while walking just six times.       Still, his up-and-down 2025 showed that the strong first impression he made in 2023 wasn't entirely PED-fueled, which some outside observers had speculated after what happened in 2024. He still hit a ball as hard as 116.7 mph in 2025, a mark topped by only 13 hitters, and if not for his miserable finish, his strikeout rate for the year would have been only 18.8 percent. The highs, particularly given where he plays his home games, are high indeed, and now that we've seen him sustain them for a longer period of time, we can hold out hope for a more stable performance.       What does that look like? I think five-category excellence. Marte is clearly strong enough to put the ball in the bleachers upward of 25 times, fast enough to continue stealing bases, and capable enough to sustain a batting average in the .275 range if he resumes his usual strikeout rate. A key will be avoiding the sort of slump that takes him out of the lineup, particularly now that he's shown himself to be a defensive liability, having made the move from third base to right field. Fortunately, we'll get to enjoy one more year of him at third base for Fantasy purposes.

What was most impressive about his first go back in 2023 was his outlier swing-and-miss ability. He began that season with a 20 percent swinging-strike rate in two months at Double-A. He ended it with a 23 percent swinging-strike rate in three major league starts. To put those numbers into context, the highest swinging-strike rate for any starting pitcher on record (minimum 100 innings) was 18.9 percent for Spencer Strider in 2023. Only one other pitcher (Blake Snell in 2019) has even broken 17 percent.       So how did the returning Emmet Sheehan fare in that regard last year? Well, his overall swinging-strike rate of 15.6 percent was still nothing short of spectacular, and that's with him not being up to form early on. Over his final six appearances, three of which lasted seven innings, he had a 1.11 ERA, 0.62 WHIP, 12.5 K/9, and, most tellingly, a 19 percent swinging-strike rate that was right in line with Strider's record-setting season.       Sure, it's always small stretches, but there's now a pattern of Sheehan doing it over several small stretches. I'm anxious to see what he'll do over a longer one. I'd still be concerned that the Dodgers will handle him with kid gloves, like they do all of their pitchers, and that's why I'd prioritize Nolan McLean and Trey Yesavage over Sheehan. But seeing him go seven innings multiple times down the stretch gives me hope.

At a time when player evaluation rarely needs to be more complicated than denoting the amount of red on a player's Baseball Savant page, the 25-year-old rates out well in that regard:       \n                                                                    via Baseball Savant\n                                                            Even if you're guided more by the top-line numbers, he slashed .284/.373/.464 with a 162-game pace of 29 home runs. His 3.08 Head-to-Head points per game were akin to Manny Machado (3.06), Vinnie Pasquantino (3.03), and Jarren Duran (3.02), all of whom are being drafted more than 100 picks earlier. Herrera even showed a dash of speed with eight stolen bases in 107 games. What's not to love?       If I could attempt to put myself in the minds of the doubters for a moment, I think my biggest hesitations would be these:       He played in just 107 games. What good is a 162-game pace for a part-time player? OK, but the shortfall was more because of health (separate IL stints for knee and hamstring issues) than role. In fact, after returning from the second of those IL stints, Herrera started 65 of the Cardinals' final 66 games, mostly at DH.You said it yourself: He's a DH. I'd much rather invest in someone who I can use at an actual position. OK, but every Fantasy Baseball format can accommodate a DH, and in the end, it's production we're after, not versatility. Secondly, he was confined to DH because a bone spur in his elbow prevented him from making the necessary throws behind the plate. Now that it's been removed, he's expected to resume catching in a part-time capacity this year while still getting the majority of his at-bats at DH, which could make for some of the most favorable eligibility of all.Oh, but you said he had surgery? Stop it already. If he played all that time with a bone spur, its removal shouldn't impact him at the plate. That injury tag next to his name is one you can safely ignore.So what am I expecting over a full season? Honestly, I think Herrera could do a pretty good Rafael Devers impression. Leaving the DH spot vacant for him on Draft Day seems like a wise idea, and it may not even be necessary with his impending return to catching duties.

He should have arrived in May and made upward of 20 starts. Instead, he arrived in August and made only seven (three of which were technically relief appearances, but they were long enough to count).       The reason for the delay initially was the Pirates' frugality, but it was perpetuated by a dreadful decline in production at Triple-A. What started as a 1.42 ERA and 0.67 WHIP in six starts there became a 4.94 ERA and 1.75 WHIP in his next 18, his walk rate jumping from 7.7 percent to 13.1 percent. When the Pirates did finally call him up, I think it was because they didn't know how else to fix him.       But it worked. Chandler blew away major league hitters with a fastball that peaked at 100 mph and generated whiffs at a rate (31 percent) that you almost never see for that particular pitch. His changeup was a world-beater as well, his entire arsenal combining for a 13.4 percent swinging-strike rate that ranked up there with Paul Skenes. Even more notable is that Chandler issued just four walks for his entire big league stay, making for a 3.2 percent rate that few pitchers in history could match. And there's no way Chandler will sustain it either, but the turnaround was so stark that I can't help but believe his struggles were largely mental, the frustration of being passed over when he felt like he had earned his shot. He more or less admitted as much both at the start of his struggles in May and the end of them in August.       Because the major league sample was small and the ERA was a slightly inflated 4.02, some drafters may not find it convincing enough to erase the memory of his miserable minor league season. But I think Chandler's talent is greater than that of Jacob Misiorowski, who's going nearly 40 picks later.

But haven't I made my point already? After all, Aranda just hit .316 with an .883 OPS, even earning a trip to the All-Star game. Yeah ... about that All-Star game. I was online during the tiebreaker swing-off and heard the snickers when Aranda was chosen as one of the AL's three representatives. And though he was the only one of the five participants not to hit a home run, merely banging one off the wall, I nonetheless took it personally.       Quite simply, you underestimate his power.       My prediction then was a second-half surge that would propel Aranda to 25 home runs, but because he wound up missing most of the second half with a fractured wrist, his breakout earns an incomplete grade. He kind of made my point, though, when he homered twice in his three games back from the injury in late September. Fourteen home runs over two-thirds of a season seems more promising than 12, even if just psychologically. And I still think it sells short the power potential of a guy who hit the ball 93 mph on average, putting him in the 94th percentile.       Wait, those numbers sound familiar. How about a little side-by-side comparison, courtesy of everyone's favorite Baseball Savant graphic?       \n                                                                    via Baseball Savant\n                                                            The player on the left is Ben Rice, whose breakout potential is so apparent to all that he's being pushed into the top 50. The player on the right is Aranda, who's barely cracking the top 200. Catcher eligibility isn't worth that much!       They're both 27. They both have mild platoon concerns. They both had the sort of minor league numbers that should have made them much bigger prospects than they were (Aranda slashed .315/.413/.546 in 231 career games at Triple-A, for goodness' sake). Aranda struck out more in 2025, but he also had the superior line drive rate. I think he's the better batting average bet of the two, actually. Look, Rice deserves to be drafted ahead of Aranda -- and I love him, too -- but Aranda is being ignored in a way that doesn't really add up for me.

Because at a glance, they look like a typical Varsho season -- 20 homers, a suboptimal batting average, etc. -- and because he's an already established asset, it's easy to label it business as usual and move on to the next guy.       But that drive-by analysis misses a crucial detail: He played in only 71 games, having missed the first month while recovering from shoulder surgery and another two because of a strained hamstring. Project his numbers over 162 games, and he's up to 46 homers, which is a horse of a different color.       Doesn't the track record count for more? Well, yeah, normally I'd say that a 29-year-old in the middle of his career is a finished product, and any departure from his career norms should be taken with a grain of salt. But normally, such players don't see their exit velocities jump 2-3 mph. Varsho was impacting the ball more like Kyle Tucker than Nolan Schanuel, and seeing as he was already a capable home run hitter at the lower velocities, a massive increase could make him one of the game's premier sluggers. It seems like we just saw the earliest signs of that.       The breakthrough is tied to a mechanical adjustment, with Varsho having learned that he's more direct to the ball when he holds his bat vertically to begin his swing. You can read more about it here if you happen to find hitting mechanics more interesting than I do, but the one quote from that Sportsnet article that stands out most to me is this one:       \"I'm not comparing him to Jose Bautista, but I think that's the one that jumps out as you figure something out mechanically, and it just gives you a better shot every single time,\" manager John Schneider said. \"So, I think that Varsh is still like an untapped resource offensively. He's got all the traits that lead you to think that he's going to be [great], and I think he's starting to get there.\"       The playing time hasn't always been consistent for Varsho, which is my biggest hesitation when drafting him, but he's a defensive asset and has respectable numbers against left-handers. He started every game of the Blue Jays' lengthy postseason run, so if he's impacting the ball just as well to begin 2026, he should quickly settle into everyday duty.    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Houston's aspirations of playing in the South Region of the NCAA Tournament, which culminates in Houston at the Toyota Center, could be heavily influenced by what the Cougars do Monday night inside Allen Fieldhouse. That will be the site of a Big 12 battle between Kansas and Houston that carries significant Bracketology implications for both.Both are coming off Saturday home losses that hindered their Big 12 title hopes, but both have plenty left to play for with Selection Sunday looming less than three weeks away. For the Cougars, the path to playing potential Sweet 16 and Elite Eight games in their own city may be hanging in the balance.Getting in position to being bracketed in the South by the committee would likely require one of the following two things for the Cougars: 1) Houston being the fourth No. 1 seed; or 2) someone other than Iowa State being the fourth No. 1 seed. With projected No. 1 seeds Duke (East), Michigan (Midwest) and Arizona (West) likely to prefer other regions, earning the fourth No. 1 seed is the most-promising route for the Cougars to play in the South.Landing as a No. 2 seed is a workable fallback solution, so long as UConn remains the fourth No. 1 seed and doesn't relinquish that spot to Iowa State. If the Cyclones  -- or another Big 12 school -- ended up as a No. 1 seed in the South Region, it's a near-certainty the selection committee would assign Houston somewhere else in adherence with bracketing principles around conference separation.More on the stakes of tonight's action in a moment.

Saturday's 84-68 home loss against Cincinnati was the Jayhawks' first 10+ point home loss to an unranked team since 1993. There is no guarantee that another loss -- especially one against a quality foe like Houston -- would immediately result in a drop from the No. 3 seed line for Kansas, but it would undoubtedly put the Jayhawks at risk of falling to the No. 4 seed line as results roll in throughout the week, and it would cap KU's seeding ceiling. A loss may mean that a No. 3 seed is the absolute best-case scenario for the Jayhawks -- even if they were to rally and finish strong.\nWhat's at stake for LouisvilleIf you take a scalpel to Louisville's resume, what you will find is that the Cardinals have a solid 7-7 Quad 1 record but an 0-5 mark in gold-plated \"Quad 1A\" opportunities. Winning on the road against North Carolina would change that. The Cardinals get that opportunity on Monday night in an ACC showdown with the Tar Heels. A win would optimize their long-term trajectory and potentially result in a jump back to the No. 5 seed line in CBS Sports Bracketology. With high-caliber road games against Clemson and Miami also on the docket before the end of the regular season, the Cardinals also have an opportunity to close with a bang and flirt with a No. 4 seed.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Just when you thought the Indiana Pacers' 2025-26 season couldn't get any stranger, star point guard Tyrese Haliburton, who has already been ruled out for the season with a torn Achilles, was diagnosed with shingles and will be away for the team for multiple weeks. Shingles, which is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox, is \"a viral infection that causes a painful rash,\" per the Mayo Clinic. It \"isn't life-threatening. But it can be very painful.\" \"It's a very painful thing,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said Sunday. \"... He will make a full recovery, but this happened over the last few days. He was meeting us in D.C. and had some odd symptoms and he came back here. That's what's happening with him. We certainly wish him a speedy recovery. It's a unique case and a unique situation, but I talked to him a few times and he's always in a good mood, so he'll get through it.\"The Pacers lost a shootout to the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, 134-130, to fall to 15-43. Less than a year after losing in Game 7 of the NBA Finals to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Pacers have the second-worst record in the league, and are in line for a top pick in the vaunted 2026 NBA Draft... maybe.\nIn the wake of Haliburton's diagnosis, here's a quick look at how the Pacers got to this point, and why they're at risk of losing their first-round pick. Injuries, injuries, injuriesIn the first five mintues of Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals, Haliburton made three 3-pointers to give the Pacers an early lead and put some fear into the Thunder crowd. Then, midway through the opening quarter, his right Achilles tendon ruptured, which essentially ended the Pacers' hopes of their first NBA title and sidelined Halburton for the entire 2025-26 season. The Pacers' record would suggest that they have deliberately tanked without Haliburton, but that's not the case. They took the Thunder to double overtime on opening night, and four of their first six losses were by six points or fewer. For the season, they have 11 losses by six points or fewer and only seven by 20 points or more. (For comparison, the Sacramento Kings, who are the only team with a worse record, have 14 losses by 20-plus points.)\nCarlisle and Co. didn't come into this season with the intention of taking a gap year. That outcome was forced upon them by a parade of injuries, particularly early in the season. Jay Huff is the only player on the roster who has played in every game, and Jarace Walker and Pascal Siakam are the only other players who haven't missed at least 10 games. All told, the Pacers have had 25 players appear in at least one contest, and their most-used lineup has only played 96 minutes together. (There are 52 different lineups across the league that have played at least 100 minutes together.)Here's a look at some of the notable injuries the Pacers have dealt with in addition to Haliburton's absence and Myles Turner's departure in free agency:\nT.J.

They compete, but no team could survive the litany of health problems they've had this season. A revolving draft pickOn June 17, 2025, just a few days before Haliburton's injury in Game 7, the Pacers traded the No. 23 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft to the New Orleans Pelicans to reacquire their first-round pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. (They had originally sent their 2026 first to the Toronto Raptors in the Siakam trade, and the Raptors had sent it to the Pelicans in the Brandon Ingram trade.)When Haliburton went down, the Pacers' 2026 first suddenly became extremely valuable -- even more so once they got off to a 2-16 start that all but assured they would be at the bottom of the standings this season. \nFor much of the season, it seemed as though the Pacers were heading toward a top pick in this year's draft, which features an array of talented players, including Kansas guard Darryn Peterson, BYU wing AJ Dybantsa and Duke forward Cameron Boozer. Then, hours before the trade deadline earlier this month, the Pacers sent Mathurin, Jackson, two first-round picks and a second-round pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Zubac and Kobe Brown. One of those firsts was the Pacers' 2026 selection. However, there is a catch. The Pacers' 2026 first is protected 1-4 and 10-30. If the Pacers' pick lands in the top four or below No. 9, they keep it and the Clippers receive their 2031 first instead. If the 2026 first falls between 5-9, the Clippers get it. The revolving 2026 first has only added to the strangeness of the last year for the Pacers. This time last year, they did not own their 2026 first. Then, for about eight months, they had sole possession of it, and all the talk was about how they would add a major prospect in the draft and be right back in position to compete next season. Now, they have acquired their center of the future, but only have partial possession of their pick, and are at risk of losing it if the ping pong balls don't go their way in a few months. \nAt this point, it's fair to say the Pacers have leaned into the tank, and who can blame them. They are three games ahead of the Kings for the worst record in the league, but only one game ahead of the Brooklyn Nets and New Orleans Pelicans for the second-worst record, two games ahead of the Washington Wizards and 3½ games ahead of the Utah Jazz. If the Pacers finish with one of the three worst records, they will have a 52.1% chance of their pick landing in the top-four. If they finish with the fourth-worst record, those odds drop to 48.1% and if they finish with the fifth-worst record, those odds drop to 42.1%. \n            ",

Shortstop is the strongest position in Fantasy, especially for 12-team leagues, where there are, if anything, more good players to go around than SS spots to put them in.Of course, that's less true in 15-team leagues, naturally. But even in 12-team leagues, I would never say you can be totally comfortable just waiting on your shortstop, either. Because, while the position has more than 12 true difference makers, some of those difference makers will be drafted by the same team – the person who takes Zach Neto might double-up and pair him with Bo Bichette in either the MI or UT spot to make up for Neto's bad batting average, for example; conversely, you might see someone take Francisco Lindor, then follow it up with Bo Bichette, with the intention of having Bichette play SS while Lindor is recovering from hand surgery, only to slide him over to 3B when he gains eligibility after the first week of the season. If you wait too long, you might end up with Dansby Swanson or Jacob Wilson as your starting shortstop. They're fine, don't get me wrong. But when everyone else in your league has true difference makers, getting someone who is just fine puts you at a disadvantage. That point comes pretty early in drafts – Willy Adames represents the end of a tier as the 14th shortstop with an ADP right around the end of the 10th round – so don't go into your draft thinking you can just play chicken with the shortstop position and still end up with a stud. Of course, the options in the early rounds at shortstop are so good that it's hard to get through a draft without drafting at least one almost by accident. If you want speed, Bobby Witt and Elly De La Cruz will provide it in the early rounds, while C.J. Abrams and Geraldo Perdomo have you covered in the 50-80 range; Gunnar Henderson could hit 30-plus homers as your second-rounder, or you could wait 80 picks and take Corey Seager to do the same. No matter what you're looking for, you can find it at shortstop, at least in the first 10 rounds. There are plenty of useful players beyond there, of course. Xavier Edwards is the No. 17 SS in ADP, but he's No. 11 at second base, to name one cross-positional example; similarly, Jose Caballero is SS21 in ADP, but he's the No. 16 third baseman. \nYou're probably going to end up with multiple shortstops on your roster, in other words. There aren't as many high-end options with multiple eligibility, but you could still build a viable team with, say, Trea Turner, Geraldo Perdomo, and Corey Seager at SS, MI, and UT while covering all five Roto categories. I'd go so far as to say, if you aren't using a shortstop in that MI spot, you're probably putting yourself at a disadvantage relative to your competition. Here's what you need to know about the

year, you're talking about a pretty good player. 2024 might end up going down as Witt's career season, but even if you could guarantee he'll never be that good again, I'm still comfortable with Witt as a top-five pick in Roto (and a first-rounder in H2H points). That down year still saw him finish seventh among all hitters, and at 25 on Opening Day, there's no reason to think he can't improve on that. He's my No. 3 player in Roto.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Cincinnati\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 24\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                18\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                9\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                2\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                19\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                2\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.264\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    102\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    86\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    37\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    181\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                You can make a similar case for Cruz, whose \"disappointing\" 2025 season still saw him finishing No. 16 overall. Would that be worth his going rate in the draft? Probably not, but a return just to 2024 numbers (when he was the No. 7 player) would. And seeing as De La Cruz didn't miss a single game last season despite playing through a torn quad in the second half strikes me as a pretty good reason to be optimistic about him besting last year's numbers. An improving roster around him and a ballpark that always helps his production make for a nice bonus, too.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Baltimore\n                    \n                                            • #2\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 24\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                16\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                14\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                3\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                15\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                3\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.274\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    85\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    68\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    137\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                2025 was a disappointing season for Henderson, but weirdly, it might have pointed the way to even more upside for a guy who has been a consensus first-rounder for a few years now. His bat never quite got going while playing through a spring intercostal injury and then a shoulder issue, but he still managed to cut his strikeout rate and increase his stolen base total for the second straight year. If he's a 30-steal guy now and he strikes out less than league average, then we could be talking about an even higher ceiling if he gets back to being a 30-plus homer guy. The quality of contact still suggests there is plus power potential here, and betting on a 24-year-old with this pedigree and track record seems like a good idea, even coming off a disappointing season.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Philadelphia\n                    \n                                            • #7\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 32\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                31\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                21\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                4\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                24\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                5\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.304\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    15\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    94\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    69\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    36\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    107\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Turner mostly managed to stay healthy, and unsurprisingly, he had his most steals in a season since 2018. Now, it's worth noting that he did miss most of the final month of the season with a hamstring injury, and it's fair to wonder if the Phillies will eventually prioritize his health over a handful of extra bases every year. Maybe that will even happen in 2026! It's fine to take that risk into account when drafting him, but with Turner remaining a threat for 20 homers, 40 steals, and a good bet for an average around .300 (he has been above .290 in six of the past seven years), his second-round price feels like it's already taking some of that risk into account.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

He had elbow surgery to clean up bone spurs earlier in the offseason and then suffered a broken hamate bone during spring training that required surgery. He hasn't been ruled out for Opening Day yet, and even if he is, he should be back within a few weeks. But missing all of Spring Training could slow him down to start the season, and there's always a chance he never quite gets back on track after that. If he's healthy and not limited, Lindor is a good bet for a 30-30 season with excellent run production, but the risk has to discount his price at least a little bit. If he's there after the first 20 or so picks, I'll move on Lindor, but probably not before then.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAA\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

He swings and misses a lot and puts up good, but not elite quality of contact numbers, which is enough to push him down a tier at this stacked position. But if Neto is your third-round pick, you know you're getting a pretty strong all-around contributor, though you'll have to be more cognizant about your batting average than with other early-rounders. He's probably a tier or so down in points leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAD\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

There are certainly reasons to believe that was the culprit, most notably with his .330 expected wOBA on contact, his worst mark in the 11 seasons of Statcast data we have. I do expect a bounce back in that regard as a result, though I don't really think we're likely to see a return to first-round viability for Betts, either. 2023 looks like a huge outlier from a power perspective – even in 2024, when he hit 19 homers in 116 games, five of those homers came in the first eight games of the season, so we're talking about a 258-game stretch where he has looked like a 15-20 homer guy. With his contact skills and the Dodgers lineup, Betts should still be a very good Fantasy option, but I think the bounce will be lower than his previous highs.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n                         \n                        Arizona\n                    \n                                            • #2\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 26\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                57\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                50\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                8\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                50\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                7\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.29\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    98\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    100\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    27\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    83\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                It's reasonable to be skeptical about Perdomo's breakout. But I think too many drafters have gone beyond \"reasonable\" here – the No. 11 player in Fantasy last season has an ADP of 78.4 right now. Perdomo doesn't hit the ball especially hard, but he did see a spike in both bat speed and quality of contact, and his contact- and pull-heavy approach allows him to get the most out of his underlying skill sets. And then there's this: Of the 16 batted balls Perdomo has had over 400 feet since making the majors in 2021, nine of them came in 2025, including six over the final six weeks of the season. The breakout might have been even more real than you realized.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        WAS\n                    \n                         \n                        Washington\n                    \n                                            • #5\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 25\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                65\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                51\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                9\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                73\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                10\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.257\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    19\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    92\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    60\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    31\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    125\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                It feels like Abrams has some untapped potential, but it's harder to make that case when you see how similar his final numbers have been the past three seasons. He hasn't exactly underperformed his underlying stats, either, so why the thought that he's leaving some meat on the bone? Well, we're talking about a premium athlete who makes a good amount of contact and occasionally turns on a ball in a way that makes you think he might look a little more like Jazz Chisholm in a best-case scenario. But with how consistent the production has actually been, you just draft him for what he's been, and you should be pretty pleased with the outcome. Anything more than that? Well, let's not get greedy.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TEX\n                    \n                         \n                        Texas\n                    \n                                            • #5\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 31\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                95\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                76\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                10\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                62\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                8\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.271\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    21\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    61\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    50\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    87\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Seager might just be the best hitter at the position. He provides nothing in speed, but you could live with that happily if you could actually count on him for 30-plus homers and an average around .300 every year. The problem is, he fell well short of that mark in 2025 as he continues to rack up IL stints. When he's on the field, you'll be happy to have Seager around, and if his price continues to dip to around 100th in drafts, you'll be happy to have him no matter what. But his value is dependent on having IL spots or deep benches to stash him in; he's also a better bet in shallower leagues, where the waiver-wire replacement level is much higher.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        NYM\n                    \n                         \n                        N.Y.

He's a fine option at shortstop and should be a true standout in batting average and RBI, but that'll all play a lot better at third, where he might be a top-six option. His lack of speed especially fits better at third base.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        HOU\n                    \n                         \n                        Houston\n                    \n                                            • #3\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 28\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                93\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                87\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                12\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                80\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                12\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.304\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    68\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    62\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    93\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                If Peña's growth as a hitter in 2025 was real, he's a steal in drafts. He's always been a pretty solid power/speed option, and it's reasonable to hope for 20-20 from him if he stays healthy. But the batting average took a big step forward in 2025 in a way that might just prove sustainable – neither his strikeout rate nor quality of contact improved dramatically, but he started pulling the ball more frequently in the air and started hitting more line drives overall, making the whole profile look a lot stronger. I'd prefer him outside of the top-100, mostly because I like Bichette and Seager a bit more, but Pena's a fine pick at his price.\n            \n            \n\nDon't Forget About ...\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #10\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 33\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                244\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                90\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                13\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                95\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                13\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.263\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    91\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    96\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    31\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    176\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Story strikes out a lot and has had a lot of trouble staying healthy in recent years, so it's not hard to see how the bottom could fall out here. But if he can just stay upright and avoid a worst-case scenario with his strikeout rate, the skill set here is surprisingly durable – despite all the injuries, he still managed 21 homers and 29 steals in 163 games across his first three seasons in Boston, not far off what he actually managed in 2025. He's more of a fallback option at shortstop, but he probably won't be a bad one.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SF\n                    \n                         \n                        San Francisco\n                    \n                                            • #2\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 30\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                154\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                109\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                14\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                142\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                15\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.225\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    30\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    94\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    87\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    12\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    179\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                The Adames signing looked like a disaster in the first few months of 2025, and he ended the first half of his first season in San Francisco hitting just .220/.307/.373. Something clicked in July, however, and he put up a .232/.335/.494 line in the second half and finished the season with 30 homers and 12 steals, more or less what we were hoping for from him. The batting average is unlikely to ever be helpful at this point, but 30 homers and double-digit steals feel like a good bet for Adames.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHC\n                    \n                         \n                        Chi.

The batting average has been below .250 three years in a row and four out of five, and that's the primary thing holding him back from the rest of the pack at the position. But if you account for a lower average from this lineup spot, he's a pretty projected 20-20 guy with decent run production. He's unlikely to ever match that career year in 2022 again, but Swanson is another decent fall-back option here.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ATH\n                    \n                         \n                        Athletics\n                    \n                                            • #5\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 23\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                94\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                167\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                16\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                118\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                14\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.311\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    13\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    62\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    63\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    39\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Wilson represents a point in the rankings where I see a significant dropoff, and where I would feel especially uncomfortable with getting my starter from. There's nothing wrong with just being Luis Arraez, but I do think Wilson is basically just Luis Arraez. He doesn't hit the ball any harder than Arraez and really isn't a significantly better athlete, which makes it tough to project either double-digit homers or steals. The batting average will be excellent, and his home park does make it a bit easier to see 10 homers from Wilson than Arraez, and he's young enough that there's room for growth. But I don't expect to see much, and I view Wilson as more or less just a batting average specialist at this point.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        MIA\n                    \n                         \n                        Miami\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 26\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                214\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                177\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (2B)\n                                \n                                11\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                193\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (2B)\n                                \n                                11\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.283\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    75\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    43\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    27\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    88\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Edwards should help in batting average, but he isn't quite as much of a standout as Wilson is likely to be. However, the ceiling could be similar, and Edwards does project to be a standout in stolen bases – though not necessarily as much as we hoped heading into 2025. He ended up with a solid 27 steals in 2025, and while I think there's room for improvement there, it's also worth noting that his sprint speed was just 75th percentile, so this might just be who he is. If all he is is a .280 hitter with 30 steals and 80 runs, that's perfectly fine at his price, but it wouldn't take much to get him to .300 and 40 steals, which would be a fantastic outcome.\n            \n            \n\nSleeper\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        STL\n                    \n                         \n                        St. Louis\n                    \n                                            • #77\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 23\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                133\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                206\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (2B)\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                214\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (2B)\n                                \n                                NR\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats (AA/AAA: 109 games)\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    .306\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    82\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    59\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    23\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    73\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Wetherholt is likely to be the starting second baseman for the Cardinals, and he's a lot more interesting when he qualifies there. But even if he's only a shortstop, Wetherholt has enough talent to matter even in 12-team leagues. The No. 7 pick in the 2024 draft, Wetherholt hit .306/.421/.510 with 17 homers and 23 steals in 109 games across the high minors, and that included a 91.4 mph average exit velocity at Triple-A – a sign that the power is more than just fringe-y. Wetherholt should hit for a solid batting average, and expecting 15-15 production seems reasonable enough, but with a player this young and talented, that certainly isn't the ceiling. If his ADP remains outside of the top-200, he should be a priority later-round target in all leagues.\n            \n            \nBreakout\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CIN\n                    \n                         \n                        Cincinnati\n                    \n                                            • #44\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 24\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                18\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                9\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                2\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                19\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                2\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.264\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    102\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    86\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    37\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    181\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Remember in Toy Story 2 when Woody's arm gets frayed, and Andy very heartlessly tells him, \"I don't wanna play with you anymore?\" That's Fantasy Baseball players with Elly De La Cruz. For years, you had to talk Fantasy players down from getting too excited about De La Cruz, ranking him as a top-five pick before he ever earned that right. In 2025, he looked like he was finally making that leap, cutting his strikeout rate to 24% in the first half and putting up a .284/.359/.495 line. The speed wasn't where it had been in previous years, but a 30-40 pace with elite run and RBI numbers was more than enough to overcome that. Then he suffered a torn quad in July, never missed a game, collapsed in the second half, and now he's a late-first-rounder who sometimes slips to the second in a Roto league? Overreaction, I say! De La Cruz just turned 24 a month and a half ago, so I think the growth we saw in the first half was real. He probably doesn't have a 70-steal ceiling anymore, but the path to legitimate plus production across all five categories is a lot more clear than a lot of folks seem to think. I'm buying the dip.\n            \n            \nBust\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        BOS\n                    \n                         \n                        Boston\n                    \n                                            • #10\n                                            •\n                                            Age: 33\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Fantasy Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    ADP\n                                \n                                244\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto\n                                \n                                90\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    Roto (SS)\n                                \n                                13\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H\n                                \n                                95\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    H2H (SS)\n                                \n                                13\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    2025 Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        AVG\n                                    \n                                    0.263\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        HR\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        R\n                                    \n                                    91\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RBI\n                                    \n                                    96\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SB\n                                    \n                                    31\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        SO\n                                    \n                                    176\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                As mentioned earlier, Story's production, even during his injury-plagued first few seasons in Boston, was strong enough that it's hard to see the bottom truly falling out. And even when he struggled in 2025 – such as when he put up a .194 xwOBA in May – he promptly bounced back, ending up with a wOBA north of .340 in each of the final four months after a slow start to the season. But man, this profile feels super risky regardless. It comes with some pretty rotten plate discipline (27% strikeout rate, 5% walk rate), and his expected stats (.249 expected batting average, .421 expected slugging percentage) don't leave a ton of margin for error. It would all be easy enough to overlook if we weren't talking about a 32-year-old who went three straight seasons without playing even 95 games before 2025. In a five-by-five Roto league context, I think the homers and steals should keep him afloat, but it's really not very hard to envision a scenario where even 20-plus homers and steals isn't enough to keep him around.\n            \n            \n\n    \n    \n                            \n                    2026 Draft Prep\n                \n                            \n                    Shortstop Top Prospects\n                \n                    \n            1. Konnor Griffin, SS, PiratesAge (on opening day): 19Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A, Double-AMinor league stats: .333 BA (484 AB), 21 HR, 65 SB, .941 OPS, 50 BB, 122 KGriffin is what everybody pictures when they hear the word \"athlete,\" which is what got him drafted ninth overall in 2024, but the ease with which he's transitioned to the pro game is what's moved him to the top of this list. For a player this imposing to also be this skilled right away is honestly reminiscent of Mike Trout, though Griffin probably won't be quite the on-base threat Trout was.Scott's 2026 Fantasy impact: fighting this spring2. Kevin McGonigle, SS, TigersAge (on opening day): 21Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A, Double-AMinor league stats: .305 BA (331 AB), 19 HR, 10 SB, .991 OPS, 59 BB, 46 KMcGonigle isn't as tooled up as Griffin but has maxed out his skills such that he's also in the No. 1 overall discussion, with Baseball America even awarding him an 80 grade for his hit tool. He doesn't impact the ball as hard as some of the elite prospects, but he's begun to adapt his swing for power and has walked more than he's struck out at every level.Scott's 2026 Fantasy impact: fighting this spring\n3. Jesus Made, SS, BrewersAge (on opening day): 18Where he played in 2025: Low-A, High-A, Double-AMinor league stats: .285 BA (453 AB), 6 HR, 47 SB, .792 OPS, 67 BB, 108 KThough Made has yet to actualize his power, it's easy to project given that he already generates exit velocities better than most major leaguers and has made it all the way to Double-A as an 18-year-old. Between his switch-hitting, his base-stealing prowess, and his knack for putting bat to ball, a Jose Ramirez-like outcome could possibly be in his future.Scott's 2026 Fantasy impact: late-season look4. JJ Wetherholt, SS, CardinalsAge (on opening day): 23Where he played in 2025: Double-A, Triple-AMinor league stats: .306 BA (408 AB), 17 HR, 23 SB, .931 OPS, 72 BB, 73 KWetherholt doesn't get the same press, but he's 90 percent of the way to being what McGonigle is, boasting a top-of-the-scales hit tool with high walk and low strikeout rates. The biggest difference is that he hasn't come as far in tailoring his swing for power despite being a couple years older, but he still homered at a nice rate.Scott's 2026 Fantasy impact: fighting this spring5. Leo De Vries, SS, AthleticsAge (on opening day): 19Where he played in 2025: High-A, Double-AMinor league stats: .255 BA (455 AB), 15 HR, 11 SB, .806 OPS, 66 BB, 107 KThe Padres tend to promote their prospects more aggressively than the numbers can keep up with, which adds suspense when they then flip one of those fast movers for, say, an ace reliever. But the Athletics followed their lead after acquiring De Vries for Mason Miller, bumping him up to Double-A almost immediately, and the 18-year-old responded by slashing .281/.359/.551 in 21 games

    "body": "\nManchester United are back on the right track and despite failing to win their fifth Premier League consecutive match last time out, they are still contenders for a Champions League spot and have a great chance on Monday to cement themselves in fourth place when they travel to face Everton. They are currently fifth, tied on points with Chelsea and with a six-point gap with Aston Villa. Manchester United manager Michael Carrick, who was hired to replace Ruben Amorim, is doing well at the club and he's hoping to be confirmed as a long term manager beyond this season. Speaking to the club channel ahead of the match against Everton, Carrick spoke on Casemiro's impact, knowing he will leave at the end of the 2025-26 season.\"He has been fantastic since I came, really, on and off the pitch, and experience is a great thing if you use it in the right way. And, again, I think over time, being a senior player here is almost the responsibility of the example, and helping the young players, helping the rest of the boys and passing on your experiences in a positive way. Yeah, he's been top since I came in, in so many ways, and he's been a pleasure to work with, and I look forward to continuing with him for a few months yet.\"Here's what you need to know ahead of the match between Everton and Manchester United: Viewing informationDate: Monday, Feb. 23 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Hill Dickinson Stadium -- Liverpool Live stream: PeacockOdds: Everton +278; Draw +266; Manchester United -105Possible lineupsEverton XI: Jordan Pickford; Jake OBrien, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski, Vitaliy Mykolenko; Gana Gueye, James Garner, Iliman Ndiaye, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall; Tyrique George, Thierno Barry.Manchester United XI: Senne Lammens; Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw; Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo; Amad Diallo, Bruno Fernandes Bryan Mbeumo; Matheus Cunha.PredictionManchester United come from four wins and one draw in the last five Premier League games played and this is their big chance to prove them again. Pick: Everton 1, Manchester United 2. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        As we slog through spring training, the weekly Power Rankings continue with different breakdowns. Last week, we went with the top 10 offenses in baseball and this time around, we're diving in on the best rotations. An exercise like this is always going to be subjective and since I'm but one person, there will be plenty of disagreement and that's cool. For me, I'd like to see an ace at the top of the rotation along with another frontline starter or two as well as depth to absorb an injury or two throughout the course of the season. Of course, very few teams will hit all of these notes. It's just a good starting point. Let's dive in. Honorable mention, in order: Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Kansas City Royals, Tampa Bay Rays, New York Mets10. New York YankeesThe Yankees have several wild cards here. Max Fried isn't one of them. He's a reliable No. 1 starter. \nCam Schlittler, on the other hand, is. We all saw how great he can be late last season, both in his 14 regular-season starts and in the playoffs. We just can't be sure how he'll hold up for a full MLB season, even if he seems like a strong bet. The biggest question mark is Gerrit Cole. The former Cy Young winner is 35 years old and coming off Tommy John surgery. He won't be ready to start the season with the club. How soon can he return and, whenever he does come back, will he return to form? Carlos Rodón is also a wild card. He was outstanding last season, finishing sixth in AL Cy Young voting. His career shows a ton of inconsistency, though, and he's recovering from elbow surgery. \nWill Warren was perfectly adequate as a rookie last year, but not good. Ryan Weathers is a former first-rounder with talent but has never thrown 100 innings in an MLB season. Luis Gil has been good, but not great, in the rotation. He'll fill in whenever needed, but he appears to be seventh on the depth chart once everyone is back.9. Toronto Blue JaysThe Jays will go through stretches this season where they have zero aces, but they also will flash a trio of them at times. Dylan Cease can be incredibly inconsistent, but the ace stuff is in there. Kevin Gausman was an ace from 2021-23, but he's fallen back a bit now as he's 35 years old. It happens. He had a 3.59 ERA in 193 innings last season and posted very good numbers in the postseason. Speaking of that postseason run, how about rookie Trey Yesavage? He looked the part of ace in multiple big-time outings. It was only his first professional season, however, so we can't be sure about his workload for this season, nor how he'll react to teams making adjustments via scouting.Cody Ponce opens the season as the fourth starter. He is returning from Korea, where he was amazing last season (17-1, 1.89 ERA, 0.94 WHIP, 252 K in 180 ⅔), but he had struggled in Japan and the majors before that. \nThen there's Shane Bieber, who is going to open the season on the injured list with a forearm injury and that's plenty scary before we consider last year marked his return from Tommy John surgery. José Berríos is dealing with an elbow injury and is allergic to consistency at this point.There's a pretty nice collection of talent here. Will it all line up perfectly when they need it most?8. Pittsburgh Pirates Needless to say, Paul Skenes does a lot of heavy lifting here. Remember, true aces are part of the equation and he worked his way up to 187 ⅔ innings last year, meaning he's likely going to top 200 this time around, taking pressure off his teammates in the process. \nAs a baseline, Mitch Keller is going to provide around 175 innings of slightly above-average work. That's valuable, even if you'd rather him be a three or four instead of a two. He starts the season as the Pirates' second starter, but there's potential for him to end up as their fifth. Braxton Ashcraft was great last season and while he spent most of it as a reliever, he finished with a 2.23 ERA in 36 ⅓ innings in his last nine outings, seven of which were starts. Bubba Chandler debuted and struck out 31 against only four walks in 31 ⅓ innings last season. These two have big potential. And then there's Jared Jones. As he comes back from elbow surgery, he'll miss the first few months of the 2026 season, but he showed good promise as a rookie in 2024. There were stretches where he looked like a frontline guy already. \nIf things come together, the Pirates will have an electric rotation down the stretch. 7. Cincinnati RedsReds pitchers are unfortunately tasked with making roughly half their starts in the most homer-friendly yard in the majors. As such, it's possible we can accept some run prevention numbers that are a bit inflated, realizing that when they're at home they can cough up a few gopher balls and still keep their team in the game. Things that account for such matters really liked the Reds' rotation last season. Per FanGraphs' WAR, the Reds were second in MLB last season in starting pitching value. Hunter Greene is a bona fide ace in my view. Andrew Abbott last season was an All-Star who finished eighth in Cy Young voting and posted a 159 ERA+ in 29 starts. Nick Lodolo broke out with a 4.9-WAR season in over 150 innings and started to resemble the ace many thought he'd be for years. That's one hell of a Big Three. Slotting Brady Singer as a No. 4 makes him look very good, too, as he was 14-12 with a 4.03 ERA (113 ERA+) in nearly 170 innings. \nFor the fifth spot, there's young Chase Burns. He was a top 30 prospect heading into last season and got his feet wet with 43 ⅓ MLB innings. He was knocked around a little, but also flashed his significant upside with 67 strikeouts. There are some concerns with depth and workload, but the talent here is huge. The Reds could easily jump into the top four.6. Philadelphia PhilliesBy some measures -- FanGraphs' WAR to name one -- the Phillies had the most valuable rotation in baseball last year. They lost Ranger Suárez to free agency, though, and there are questions regarding Zack Wheeler's return from thoracic outlet syndrome -- both in when he's back and how effective he'll be when he returns. \nThose two items alone knock the Phillies down here and I might have even been generous. Cristopher Sánchez's leap into acedom last season helps immensely. Jesús Luzardo had an excellent season and looks like a quality No. 2 here. Aaron Nola, though, was mostly awful last season as he enters his age-33 year. Taijuan Walker shouldn't be in a rotation for a contender, either.The upside here lies with Wheeler's return and the talent of youngster Andrew Painter (despite a 5.40 ERA in Triple-A last season). If Wheeler returns to being a top-shelf ace and Painter hits his upside, the Phillies are very solid here with Wheeler-Sánchez-Luzardo-Nola-Painter. \nThere are lots of ways things could head south here, though.5. Seattle MarinersWe need to start with a short bit on the Mariners' home ballpark. Yes, T-Mobile Park suppresses offense and, thus, is a big advantage here for the Mariners' rotation. Ballpark-adjusted stats will tell you I have the Mariners ranked too highly here, but they're still going to hold their opponents to a paltry number of runs, relatively speaking, while likely carrying a hefty workload. That's ultimately what matters most.Bryan Woo finished fifth in AL Cy Young voting last season at just 25 years old. He's stepping into the role of ace. Logan Gilbert is a very nice No. 2 and we've seen George Kirby look the part before (2023 and some of 2024). Veteran righty Luis Castillo is past his prime, but listing him as a four shows how good this rotation can be. Bryce Miller is a fine five with decent upside and Emerson Hancock provides depth. 4. Texas RangersThe Rangers have a lot of talent along with a good number of questions. I always say that not every question will be answered in the positive, but they won't all be answered in the negative, either. There will be wins here. \nJacob deGrom is as talented as anyone, but barely pitched from 2021-24. He came back strong last season with a 2.97 ERA in 172 ⅔ innings. How will he hold up at age 38?Nathan Eovaldi had a 1.73 ERA last season, but a shoulder injury ended his season in August and now he's 36 years old. MacKenzie Gore was an All-Star for the Nats after a great first half (3.02 ERA, 138 K in 110 ⅓ IP), but totally fell apart in the second half (6.75 ERA, 1.70 WHIP in 49 ⅓ IP). Jack Leiter was pretty good most of the time in his first full season, but there don't seem to be many reasons to believe in more than average right now. Kumar Rocker has talent but sub-par results so far in the majors. Jacob Latz has only nine career starts. Cody Bradford has shown great flashes but the last two seasons have been decimated by injuries. Jordan Montgomery was great for the 2023 World Series champion Rangers, but fell apart afterward and he's out until probably the second half of this season as he recovers from Tommy John surgery.That's eight guys. The Rangers only need 3-4 horses and five regular starters throughout the calendar. The most likely outcome is things click well more often than not. The 90th percentile outcome gives the Rangers a chance at the best rotation in baseball.3. Detroit TigersTwo-time defending AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal moves the needle in a big way here, obviously. Though he has hot competition from at least two pitchers, he's still my pick for the best pitcher in the world. Instead of trading him, thankfully, the Tigers went out and got him help late in the offseason by signing fellow lefty frontliner Framber Valdez. Though Valdez was terrible in the second half for the Astros last year, his track record says that will be just a temporary issue. Jack Flaherty comes next and he was very disappointing in 2025, but there's plenty of hope that he can pitch back to 2024 form. Casey Mize was a first-time All-Star last season and though he faltered in the second half, there's enough talent to believe he can put together a full season resembling his first half. Then there's the return of Justin Verlander. He's now 43 years old and his record last season looks awful, but he had a 2.60 ERA with 70 strikeouts in 72 ⅔ innings in his last 13 starts. As a fifth starter, there just might be something left in the tank in what's likely his final year. 2. Boston Red SoxThe Red Sox made the playoffs last season with a top-level ace, two good starters and pieced the rest together. They beefed things up this offseason. Garrett Crochet stands at the top after putting together a stellar first season in Boston, during which he finished second in Cy Young voting and eighth in MVP voting. He's heading to his age-27 season and there's no reason to believe he'll get any worse. He could even be better. All-Star lefty Ranger Suárez and three-time All-Star righty Sonny Gray were added this offseason. Neither are in the \"true ace\" category, but both can pitch like frontline starters. Brayan Bello sits in the four spot and he's much better looking there than at two. Johan Oviedo can fill the five spot, but so could Connelly Early. Kutter Crawford is coming back from surgery and perhaps this time around Payton Tolle sticks. Patrick Sandoval is here too. There's good talent in the depth. 1. Los Angeles DodgersYep, the defending champs have the top offense and top rotation in baseball, per my personal rankings. They didn't even need any outside-the-organization moves to shore anything up here. We saw it all on display last postseason as the Dodgers won the World Series behind dominant starters. Fresh off a World Series MVP and 1.45 ERA in 37 ⅓ playoff innings -- not to mention a third-place Cy Young finish in the regular season -- Yoshinobu Yamamoto fits the mold of a true ace. Shohei Ohtani can pitch like an ace and we've seen that more often than not whenever he's healthy enough to pitch. Blake Snell has won two Cy Youngs. Tyler Glasnow has Cy Young-level talent. That's four guys capable of throwing like elite-tier aces in one rotation. Roki Sasaki and Emmet Sheehan are the fifth and sixth guys here and there's more depth like Ben Casparius, Landon Knack, Gavin Stone and River Ryan.As noted, I ranked the Dodgers as the top offense in baseball. I like the rotation better. \n            ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nGood morning to everyone but especially to the United States men's hockey team. Carter Bahns with you this Monday morning to relish Team USA's victory over Canada in the gold medal game of the final event at the 2026 Winter Olympics. What a way to end a simply tremendous two weeks of peak athletic performance in Northern Italy. I'm already counting down the days until 2030. We will, of course, open today's newsletter with the hockey triumph. But we also have some college basketball to discuss -- I see you, Duke! -- and the opening weekend of MLS action to cover. Let's dive in.  Five things to know Monday For the first time in 46 years, the United States men's hockey team reigns supreme. Team USA defeated Canada in a 2-1 overtime classic to win the Olympic hockey tournament and bring gold medals back to the States for the first time since the \"Miracle on Ice\" team won in 1980. Jack Hughes established himself as an American hockey legend when he delivered the game-winner in Sunday's battle, and he did so with a couple fewer teeth than when he started the game. This is the first time that the men's and women's team have won gold in the same Olympics, and it put the finishing touches on an unforgettable Milan Cortina Games in which the United States racked up 12 gold medals -- the most in the nation's history. Our Matt Norlander offers his thoughts on what made the Milan Cortina Games one of the best Winter Olympics ever.Floyd Mayweather will end his retirement and return to boxing. After nine years out of the ring, the undefeated boxing legend is set to make a comeback. Mayweather (50-0) has a planned exhibition bout with Mike Tyson this spring, and he will seek professional fights after that event. While Mayweather took eight exhibition fights since his retirement, he has not competed professionally since his 2017 win over Conor McGregor.Pablo López will miss the 2026 season for Tommy John surgery. Following an offseason in which the Twins struggled to position themselves for a postseason push, they lost a critical piece of their rotation to further limit their potential. López will reportedly undergo his second Tommy John surgery to repair a torn UCL and may not return until the middle of the 2027 campaign. Minnesota must move forward without an arm that delivered a 2.74 ERA and 73 strikeouts over 75.2 innings last year.Joey Aguilar was denied a preliminary injunction, ending his college football career. The NCAA came out on the right side of another eligibility ruling with Aguilar reportedly denied the opportunity to play another season at Tennessee. The ruling forces the Volunteers to hand the keys to their offense to an unproven option with George MacIntyre, Faizon Brandon and Ryan Staub set to compete for the job this spring and summer. This is the third key eligibility case to end this month after Alabama basketball player Charles Bediako was deemed ineligible and Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss received an injunction to play in 2026. The football community mourns the death of Rondale Moore. Lastly, on a somber note, the NFL lost a five-year wide receiver on Saturday to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Moore did not play in 2025 with the Vikings nor in 2024 with the Falcons due to injuries, but he opened his career with three productive years with the Cardinals after being selected in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft. He was a college football star who dazzled as a freshman, winning numerous Big Ten and national awards at Purdue. Moore, gone far too soon, was 25. 🔢 Do not miss this: 2026 WNBA Draft Big Board 1.0 \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The 2026 WNBA Draft is fewer than two months away, and uncertainty abounds as the league and its players union continue collective bargaining negotiations. Predicting 2026 rosters is difficult because of the halt on free agency and the double expansion draft, so instead of building a mock draft, Jack Maloney ranked the top 20 prospects from college basketball and overseas. \nThe big board places the top prospects into six tiers. Tier 1 includes just two players: Spanish center Awa Fam and TCU guard Olivia Miles. Maloney explained why Miles is the best college prospect. Maloney: \"Miles would have been a lottery pick last year if she had entered the draft, but she decided to return to school and transferred to TCU, where she's been able to run the show in Mark Campbell's spread pick-and-roll system. In just a few months in Fort Worth, Miles has proven that she's more than capable of being an offensive engine.\"See the full big board for complete player rankings. To summarize the list, here is the top player from every tier: Tier 1: Awa Fam, C, SpainTier 2: Azzi Fudd, G, UConnTier 3: Kiki Rice, G, UCLATier 4: Gabriela Jaquez, G, UCLATier 5: Janiah Barker, F, TennesseeTier 6: Charlisse Leger-Walker, G, UCLAAlso, here's how South Carolina's Raven Johnson proved that she is worthy of a first-round selection even though she scored just six points in Sunday's win over Ole Miss. \n 🏀 NCAA Tournament selection committee previews bracket; ranked matchups shake up March Madness outlook \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            The NCAA Tournament selection committee kicked off a huge weekend of college basketball with its annual unveiling of the in-season top 16 seeds. If the regular season ended on Saturday, No. 1 Michigan would have been the top overall seed in March Madness with No. 3 Duke, No. 4 Arizona and No. 6 Iowa State rounding out the rest of the No. 1 seed line. The reveal offered insight into this particular committee's decision-making process, and our Matt Norlander and David Cobb also got a behind-the-scenes look at how the committee will build the 2026 bracket. Here are the top 16 teams from the bracket preview: No. 1: Michigan, Duke, Arizona, Iowa StateNo. 2: UConn, Houston, Illinois, PurdueNo. 3: Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, GonzagaNo. 4: Texas Tech, Michigan State, Vanderbilt, VirginiaWhat unfolded in the hours after the committee's announcement brought immediate changes to the postseason outlook. Duke 68, Michigan 63: The Blue Devils notched the 11th victory over a top-ranked team in program history behind a near triple-double from Cameron Boozer.Cincinnati 84, Kansas 68: The No. 8 Jayhawks had not lost to an unranked team at home by more than 10 points since 1993 before the shockingly lopsided upset. Not even a full game from Darryn Peterson could prevent the devastating loss.Auburn 75, Kentucky 74: Mark Pope was caught on a hot mic saying the officials \"cheated\" the Wildcats out of a victory as his squad lost its third game in a row.Check out our updated bracketology in the wake of these results and others, including Arizona's win at No. 2 Houston. And see how we expect the AP Top 25 poll to shake out when it is released this afternoon. \n 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            MLS is back, and the 2026 season already has significant drama.

    "body": "\n        Ohio State's long pursuit of a Quad 1 victory endured another frustrating twist Sunday when the Buckeyes lost 66-60 at Michigan State after spending most of the second half within striking distance of a potential season-shifting win. After dropping to 0-9 in Quad 1 opportunities, Ohio State is back on the wrong side of the bubble in the CBS Sports Bracketology model.The battered Buckeyes are one of four Big Ten teams living on the edge with just two weeks left in the regular season. Between the No. 10 seed line and the \"Next Four Out\" are UCLA (10), USC (First Four Out), Indiana (First Four Out) and Ohio State (Next Four Out).No one stumbled harder over the weekend than USC, which suffered a Quad 3 home loss to Oregon. Even with leading scorer Chad Baker-Mazara back from a three-game injury absence, the Trojans couldn't hang on to a late lead. After entering the weekend as a No. 10 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, USC now has some ground to make up heading into Tuesday night's rivalry showdown at UCLA.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Houston's Monday night showdown at Kansas is critical for Cougars' No. 1 seed aspirations\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMore on the Big Ten's bubble teams in a moment. But first, here's a look at the NCAA Tournament bubble from the CBS Sports Bracketology model.\nLast Four InSanta ClaraNew MexicoTCUCalFirst Four OutVCUOhio StateUSCIndianaNext Four OutSeton HallVirginia TechSan Diego StateArizona StateCheck out the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest bracket at the Bracketology hubNCAA Tournament bubble spotlightOhio State's injuries\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ohio State guard John Mobley Jr. missed his third straight game on Sunday in the Buckeyes' loss at Michigan State. The star sophomore is dealing with a hand injury, and Ohio State is now 1-2 without its second-leading scorer. Third-leading scorer Devin Royal also missed the game due to illness, while freshman forward Amare Bynum played ineffectively through illness.Rotation forward Brandon Noel has been out since Jan. 5 with a lower leg injury. The myriad health issues will give the NCAA Tournament selection committee something to ponder when evaluating Ohio State, but cracking the field of 68 without a single Quad 1 win would be tough. Fortunately for Ohio State, it has projected \"Quad 1A\" at Iowa and against Purdue up next. They will be big tests, but they are also big opportunities.\nIndiana's divisive resume\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indiana's resume can be interpreted in a variety of ways. An easy argument for the Hoosiers is that they have three victories over projected NCAA Tournament teams over the past month, including wins over Purdue, UCLA and Wisconsin. While those victories came by a combined seven points -- two of them requiring overtime -- they are are evidence of this team's ability.But the grim reality is that IU is just 4-10 across Quad 1 and Quad 2. That is fewer Quad 1/2 victories than anyone else in the top 50 of the NET aside from Miami (Ohio). The average of Indiana's results-based metrics is hovering in the mid-40s, which is risky territory. Its predictive metrics average out in the mid 30s, which is encouraging. But the Hoosiers are down to No. 41 at KenPom after losing to Illinois and Purdue by a combined 49 points in their past two outings.UCLA's big win\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Whether it's coach Mick Cronin garnering headlines for his unique antics or UCLA winding up in dramatic games, the Bruins always seem to make things interesting. The roller coaster ride took a good turn over the weekend, though. A thrilling 95-94 overtime victory over Illinois on Saturday ensured the Bruins' spot on the right side of the bubble entering the last week of February.\nWins over Purdue and Illinois came at home by a combined three points, but they are evidence that UCLA at its best is a high-ceiling team.\n            ",

United faced Everton at home only to see midfielder Idrissa Gueye receive a red card in the 13th minute for Everton. United played a man up for a total of 85 minutes and ended up not only losing, but failing to score in their 1-0 defeat. Manchester United were the talk of the news cycle that week as they were dragged through the mud for their inability to produce a result, and that should be on the back of their mind in this fixture. Even though United just drew against West Ham, they've been in fantastic form in the new year, and I expect them to press against an Everton side missing their best attacker and a key defender. Bet on Everton vs. Manchester United at BetMGM using the promo code CBSSPORTS, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if their qualifying wager loses:Everton's defensive woes in 2026Everton have shown some serious signs of improvement this season. The club finished 15th two years ago, 13th last season and are currently positioned safely at eighth on the EPL table right now. While the club has found some success, their defense in the new year does have me a bit concerned as they face a strong United attack. They've played eight matches in 2026 and only a single time were they able to keep a clean sheet. They've conceded 11 goals over those six matches, and going against United they'll be without a senior defender, Jake O'Brien, who was sent off with a red card last match in their loss to Bournemouth, which will put more pressure on Jarrad Branthwaite and James Tarkowski to hold that backline. Everton is good enough to score here with Dewsbury-Hall and lliman Ndiaye in form, but expect that defense to let some through. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a career that has been filled with memorable moments, Pat Riley made history once again on Sunday by becoming the first Los Angeles Lakers coach to receive a statue. Riley, who has served as the Miami Heat's president since 1995, was back in Los Angeles this weekend as the Lakers made him the eighth member of the franchise to receive a statue outside Crypto.com Arena. Riley won six NBA titles with the Lakers that included one as a player, one as an assistant coach and four as head coach during franchise's iconic \"Showtime\" era during the 1980s. The statue depicts Riley with his patented slicked back hair and dressed in one of his tailored Armani suits. The statue also includes the following quote Riley that has long attributed to his father, the same quote he referenced during his famous pregame speech that helped spearhead the Lakers' comeback over the Boston Celtics during the 1985 NBA Finals: \"There will come a time when you are challenged. And when that time comes, you must plant your feet. You must stand firm. You must make a point. About who you are, what you do, and where you come from. And when that time comes, you do it.\" \nSeveral prominent figures in Lakers history spoke at the statue unveiling, including \"Showtime\" stars Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Shaquille O'Neal, a fellow former Lakers great who won a title with Riley with the Heat in 2006, also spoke in a video that was played. Dwyane Wade, who led the Heat to that championship victory over the Dallas Mavericks, also spoke at the ceremony. Heat owner Micky Arison was also in attendance. O'Neal, during his speech, recalled a practice where he confronted Riley, who stood his ground. \n\"I remember thinking, 'Oh, this man is different.'\" O'Neal recalled. \"You don't build dynasties if you're afraid of personalities, and Pat was never afraid.\"O'Neal also confirmed that Riley -- a master motivator -- did indeed dunk his head in a bucket of freezing water and held his breath for more than four minutes in an effort to galvanize his team. \"Finally, he came up, gasping for air, and said, 'We cannot win unless we treat it as if it's our last breath,'\" O'Neal recalled. \"That's how he coached. Everything urgent, everything intense, everything championship level. And that mentality, that's why this statue belongs here.\" \nJohnson, who became arguably the greatest point guard in NBA history under Riley's watch, called on the other \"Showtime\" members in the audience to stand while giving his speech. \nJeanie Buss, the governor and minority owner of the Lakers, also spoke while reference what her farther, the late Dr. Jerry Buss, said of Riley during his 2010 induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\"Dr. Buss was right of course. Pat really was a guardian angel for this franchise, its employees, and most important, its fans across the world,\" she said. \nA tenacious, blue collar player who played for the legendary Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, Riley was a member of the 1972 Lakers team that won a then-NBA record 69 regular season games and continues to hold the NBA record with 33 consecutive games. He then dabbled in broadcasting before winning a title in 1980 as Paul Westhead's assistant. Riley was promoted to head coach during the 1982 season and quickly guided the Lakers to another NBA title. The Lakers then lost consecutive NBA Finals that included a gut-wrenching loss the Celtics in 1984 in a classic series that went the distance. In what was arguably his greatest coaching moment, Riley led the Lakers to a six-game series win over the Celtics in the 1985 NBA Finals after Los Angeles lost by 34 points in Game 1 in a game that was immediately dubbed \"The Memorial Day Massacre.\" Riley's passionate leadership appeared to have a significant impact on Abdul-Jabbar, who at age 38 was named the MVP of the series after leading the Lakers to their first championship series win over the Celtics. \nTwo years later, the Lakers defeated the Celtics in the NBA Finals on the strength of Johnson, who was named the MVP of the regular season and the Finals after Riley directed him at the start of the season to become the focal point of the offense from a scoring standpoint, something that point guards of that era seldom did. \"I said, 'Did you ask Kareem?'\" Johnson jokingly recalled saying to Riley during his speech. \"He pushed me to a whole other level. ... Pat was way ahead of his time in coaching.\" During the team's victory celebration, Riley famously guaranteed the Lakers would successfully defend their title. It wasn't easy, by the Lakers did defeat the Pistons in a classic seven-game series to become the NBA's first repeat champion in 19 years. \nRiley later enjoyed successful coaching stops with the New York Knicks and Miami Heat. In 1994, he led the Knicks to their first NBA Finals appearance in 21 years. In Miami, he coached the Heat to their first title before overseeing the franchise's last two championship wins as team president. \"Pat could build different identities in different cities,\" Wade said during his speech. \"Showtime to grit, it's the same standard, it's the same leadership. Just a little different style.\" As he concluded his speech, Riley fittingly alluded to the Lakers' arch rival, whom they would face yet again later in the day. \n\"The time has come to kick some ass,\" Riley told the crowd. \"The time has come to kick some Boston ass.\" \n            ",

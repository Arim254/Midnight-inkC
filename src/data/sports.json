    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Chargers (6-3) host the Pittsburgh Steelers (5-3) on Sunday Night Football in Week 10 for an AFC game that could have a significant impact on who makes the postseason at the end of the year. The Chargers are coming off a 27-20 victory over the Titans in a surprisingly close contest that saw them fall behind, 14-7, after the first quarter. The Steelers are coming off an impressive 27-20 win over the Colts, handing Indianapolis just its second loss of the season. The Chargers are 2.5-point favorites, according to the latest Steelers vs. Chargers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 44.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Chargers vs. Steelers.

Pittsburgh intercepted Daniel Jones three times in the victory and held the No. 1 scoring offense to 20 points (the Colts are averaging 32.2 ppg this season) after allowing more than 30 points in back-to-back contests. The model believes that defensive success will continue into Sunday Night Football to cover the margin. Aaron Rodgers has been efficient for the Steelers, throwing for 17 touchdowns compared to five interceptions, while completing 68.7% of his passes for 211.5 yards per game. The model projects the Steelers to cover in 56% of simulations.Over 44.5 pointsThe Over has hit in four straight Chargers games, and the over/under total was between 43.3-48.5 points in those contests. Los Angeles' games aren't hitting Overs due to elite offensive or lackluster defensive performances, as the Chargers are 17th in scoring offense (23.9 ppg) and 12th in scoring defense (21.4 ppg). But they consistently have games with just enough scoring to outscore the sportsbooks' expectations, as the betting apps continue to set their number at lower totals. Each of those four games went Over 45 points as well. Meanwhile, the Steelers have the No. 12-ranked scoring offense (25.3 ppg) and 21st-ranked defense (24.4 ppg), and each of the last three Pittsburgh games has totaled more than 45 points. The model projects the Over to hit in 51% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

The 49ers will host the Rams at 4:25 p.m. ET, with Los Angeles listed as a 5.5-point road favorite. Elsewhere, the Seahawks are seven-point favorites against the Cardinals and the Chargers are three-point favorites against the Steelers on Sunday Night Football in a game with an over-under of 44.5.SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Under (49.5) in 49ers vs. Rams and is also targeting the Seahawks and Steelers to cover the spread in their respective matchups. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nUnder 49.5 in 49ers vs. RamsThese division rivals have gone Under in nine of their last 12 meetings in San Francisco, including a 12-6 final last December in a game that had an over/under of 48.5. They combined for 49 points when they met in Los Angeles on Oct. 2, but the total closed at 43.5 points in that matchup, and it took overtime to get to 49. Given the 49ers' slew of injuries on both sides of the ball and the inflated total compared to their first meeting of the year, the model has the Under cashing in 63% of simulations. Bet 49ers vs. Rams at bet365 here:  Seahawks -6.5 vs. CardinalsSeattle has dominated this rivalry in recent years, going 9-1 straight up and 8-2 against the spread in the last 10 meetings. The Seahawks have won the last three games at home by 10 points, and they are riding a three-game winning streak entering this contest. Arizona continues playing without starting quarterback Kyler Murray (foot), so the model has Seattle covering 56% of the time. Bet Seahawks vs. Cardinals at bet365 here:  Steelers +2.5 vs. ChargersThis has been another lopsided series of late, with Pittsburgh winning 11 of the last 15 matchups and covering the spread in seven of the last eight meetings hosted by the Chargers. Los Angeles could be without three starters along the offensive line, which does not bode well against a Pittsburgh defense that racked up 19 total pressures and five sacks in a win over Indianapolis last week. The Steelers rank second in the NFL in turnover differential, and Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert has thrown an interception in three straight games, which are all reasons why the model has Pittsburgh covering the spread in 54% of simulations. Bet Steelers vs. Chargers at bet365 here:  \nLooking for more Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Sunday.

    "body": "\n        In Week 10, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 11 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Jalen Nailor, WR,  VikingsWith J.J. McCarthy at quarterback, the Vikings pass attack has a brand new look and feel. That hasn't meant good things for Justin Jefferson so far. Or Jordan Addison. But McCarthy has had no trouble getting to Nailor on those rail routes. Nailor was one of the most productive Fantasy Football wide receivers in Week 10. He racked up 124 receiving yards on five receptions and scored a touchdown. He also saw six targets. Keep an eye on McCarthy's developing rapport with Nailor as McCarthy is set to be the starting quarterback for the rest of the season. Nailor has flashed in the past on waiver wires but has not developed a consistency to stick.Kyle Williams, WR, PatriotsWilliams was a Beyond the Boxscore favorite for both Jacob Gibbs and me as we couldn't get enough of his college tape at Washington State. Williams was viewed by some NFL circles as a slot-only receiver option, causing him to fall slightly in the draft, but his 4.4 speed is real. He can threaten defenses vertically in addition to creating separation with plus route running, quickness, and lateral agility. Earlier this week, the Patriots coaching staff confirmed Williams would get more opportunities in Week 10 with Kayshon Boutte out. Williams saw just two targets but he turned one of them into a 72-yard touchdown on a deep over route crossing across the middle. He showed off speed and explosiveness that might make the Patriots coaching staff second guess taking him off the field in the second half of the 2025 season.Luther Burden, WR, BearsThe Bears drafted Burden to be a playmaker in their offense and there were some Fantasy Football analysts who projected he might take the Amon-Ra St. Brown role in Ben Johnson's offense. He hasn't been able to find steady playing time just yet, but with another dropped pass from Olamide Zaccheaus, Burden might be inching closer to taking over his role in the Bears offense. Burden is an explosive weapon who turned his three targets in Week 10 into 51 yards receiving on three receptions. \nTyler Shough, QB, SaintsWell that was unexpected! Shough found a rhythm in Week 10 and showed off an impressive ability to operate Kellen Moore's offense. He averaged over 10 yards per attempt (10.4) -- pheonemal for any quarterback let alone a rookie. He developed a rapport and found rhythm throwing to his No. 1 receiver that he struggled to get on the same page with last week in Chris Olave. Shough and Olave connected on five-of-eight targets for 104 yards and a touchdown. This included a beautiful 62-yard shot play to Olave. After losing Rashid Shaheeh (trade), Shough was able to lean on Olave and Juwan Johnson to the tune of 196 yards combine. Shough finished with 282 passing yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.Tyler Allgeier, RB, FalconsAll Allgeier does is convert touchdowns, run hard and put together productive gains when given opportunities. At this point it's not an abberation -- it's a trend -- Allgeier is the red zone back. He continues to outtouch Bijan Robinson in red zone situations. And he converts. Allgeir is worth stashing on your bench in all leagues. \nMack Hollins, WR, PatriotsHollins continues to play a larger role in the Patriots offense tahn just about anyone projected. In Week 10, he led all Patriots receivers with a whopping 10 targets. His size on the outside is a massive plus for New England in their run game so I expect he'll continue to earn the majority of snaps as one of the two boundary receivers in this scheme. Hollins turned his 10 targets into 106 receiving yards on six receptions. An 100-yard receiving game is nothing to overlook.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOS CABOS, Mexico (AP) -- Ben Griffin avoided the mistakes that slowed his two challengers Sunday and rolled in three long birdie putts for a 9-under 63 to win the World Wide Technology Championship for his third PGA Tour title of the season.Griffin two-putted for birdie on the par-5 18th at El Cardonal at Diamante for a two-shot victory. He joined Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy as the only players with at least three wins, with one of those for Griffin a team event in New Orleans.Griffin, playing for the second time since his Ryder Cup debut, ran off five straight birdies starting at No. 8. That included a 40-foot putt on the par-3 11th to tie the lead, a 25-foot putt on the 12th for his first lead and a 25-foot putt on the par-3 16th that all but sealed it.He made birdie on all four of the par 3s.\"After making a few birdies early, I kind of pushed myself a little bit harder than the past few weeks when I was in contention to kind of keep the pedal down,\" Griffin said. \"Fortunately, the putter heated up, made a lot of putts on the back nine. It was fun feeling the nerves down the stretch trying to hold things off. It was nice to make a couple down the stretch.\"\nGriffin moves to a career-best No. 9 in the world ranking.Sami Valimaki (64) and Chad Ramey (65) tied for second and picked up a valuable consolation. Valimaki started the week at No. 103 in the FedEx Cup and moved to No. 76, assuring a full card for next year. Ramey went from No. 123 to No. 89 and is likely safe to keep his card.Two tournaments remain before the top 100 in the FedEx Cup keep full status for 2026.\"These last three tournaments, only goal was to kind of keep the playing rights for the next year, so I think they should be a done deal with this finish,\" Valimaki said.\nGriffin's biggest challenge came from Garrick Higgo and Carson Young, who shared the lead going to the back nine on another day of virtually no wind.Higgo's came undone with a tee shot into a bush on No. 12 that required him to take a penalty for an unplayable lie, leading to a double bogey. He shot 68 and finished three behind.Young made a 15-foot birdie putt on the 12th and was tied with Griffin at 27 under.\nBut his approach on the 13th went left down a slope, across a cart path and into the native area. He made bogey, hit a pedestrian pitch on the par-5 14th that kept him from a good look at birdie, and then three-putt for bogey on the 15th. He shot 68 and tie for sixth.Griffin had no such issues aside from a three-putt bogey on the fifth hole. He was rock solid from there and finished at 29-under 259.And his year is not over. He is getting married next month to Dana Myeroff.\"Crazy, three wins and getting married in the same year, hard to beat,\" Griffin said.\nHiggo moved to No. 52 in the FedEx Cup, which at least locks up a spot for him to play Pebble Beach and Riviera early next season, both $20 million signature events. He has finished no worse that a tie for seventh in his four starts during the FedEx Cup Fall.\"A lot of good stuff,\" Higgo said. \"I've been in contention the last four events, so I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Houston Texans pulled off one of the wildest comebacks of the season over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, and in the process, the two teams combined to make some history. The game ended with the Texans topping the Jags 36-29, a score that had never been seen before in the 106-year history of the NFL.Yup, we got a scorigami. With seven seconds left to play, it didn't look like a scorigami was going to happen. The Texans were leading 30-29 with the Jaguars sitting at their own 35-yard line. Jacksonville needed just 12 to 15 yards to get in field goal range for Cam Little, but that didn't happen because Trevor Lawrence got strip-sacked on the play. After Lawrence lost the ball, Sheldon Rankins grabbed it and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown to account for the final points, which officially gave us the 1,094th unique final score in NFL history. \nWhen a player scores with no time left on the clock, you don't have to kick the extra point, and that came in play here because 37-29 would NOT have been a scorigami. The touchdown by Rankins capped an improbable fourth quarter by the Texans, who scored 26 points during the final period to wipe away a 29-10 deficit. Going into Sunday, the Texans had been 0-96 in franchise history when trailing by 15 points or more entering the fourth quarter. \nThe comeback was possible thanks to an offense that came alive and a dominant performance by the defense. The Texans defense forced two punts while holding the Jaguars to just 11 yards in the fourth quarter, which allowed the offense to get Houston back in the game. Davis Mills threw for 104 yards and two touchdowns in the final quarter and then capped off the comeback by scoring on a 14-yard run that gave Houston its first lead of the game with just 31 seconds left to play. \nMills was playing for C.J. Stroud, who was sidelined this week due to a concussion. Overall, Mills threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns in the win. This game marks the third scorigami of the 2025 season. There were a total of seven during the 2024 season, but since they become more difficult to achieve with each new score that happens, it's unlikely that we'll see the NFL hit that total this year. This is the second time in the past 12 months that the Jaguars have been involved in a scorigami. Their last one came in November 2024 in a game where they lost to the Lions, 52-6. \nAs for the Texans, this is the second time this calendar year that they've been involved in a scorigami. Their last one came in January during a 32-12 win over the Chargers in the wild-card round of the playoffs. The Texans have been involved in four scorigamis since the start of the 2023 season. \n            ",

Their +9 turnover differential is second-best in the league, while just six teams have a worse turnover differential than the Chargers (-4). Pittsburgh's defense also stepped up in a big way in its defeat of the Colts, holding the league's top-scoring team to 13 points fewer than their season average on Sunday.On offense, Aaron Rodgers is having his best season in years as his 68.7 completion percentage is the third-best of his career, with only a pair of his MVP seasons ranking higher. He has 17 touchdown passes, compared to just five picks, and he's thrown for 10 scores across just three road games. Additionally, Pittsburgh excels on the margins as it has the best average starting field position in the NFL, and just three teams have been assessed for fewer penalty yards that the Steelers. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can winThe NFL has evolved into a passing league over the years, and few teams are as proficient, on both sides of the ball, in the air game than Los Angeles. It has the No. 6 passing offense as Justin Herbert ranks second in both passing yards and passing touchdowns. Meanwhile on defense, the Chargers rank No. 3 in defending thru the air, and only Buffalo has allowed fewer passing touchdowns.The Chargers can also take advantage of deficiencies with the Steelers, namely Pittsburgh's struggles in the ground game. The Steelers rank 30th in rushing offense and are 28th in yards per carry. However, that 30th ranking is still better than what Pittsburgh's pass defense has, as the team has been anything but a Steel Curtain. Pittsburgh is dead last in defending the pass, and it has given up at least 313 passing yards in three straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest BetMGM bonus code to get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:How to make Chargers Steelers picksWhite has analyzed Steelers vs. Chargers   from every angle and he's leaning Under on the point total.

    "body": "\n        MANCHESTER -- Though he was at pains to emphasize that the two-goal hole Liverpool found themselves in was a fair reflection of the first half, Arne Slot insisted the story of his side's 3-0 hammering at Manchester City could have been rather different if VAR had not overruled Virgil van Dijk's 38th-minute header.Captain Van Dijk thought he had brought Liverpool level when he guided Mohamed Salah's delivery onto a powerful arc that curled inside the far post, seemingly cancelling out Erling Haaland's earlier header. However, his celebrations were soon punctured by jubilation at the Etihad Stadium as video assistant referee Michael Oliver instructed him to overturn the goal. Andrew Robertson had ducked out of the way of the header and was certainly near the ball, though controversy reigned over whether he had been standing between Van Dijk and Donnarumma.Slot was insistent that that was not the case, saying it was \"obvious and clear that the wrong decision had been made.\" Before halftime was out, Liverpool would find themselves in an irretrievable position, Nico Gonzalez striking low and hard from outside the box. The two-goal deficit was a fair reflection of a half in which Haaland and Jeremy Doku had run the champions ragged and indeed was one that Slot had few complaints about in his post-match press conference. However, he could not help but reflect on what might have been if his side had been given their equalizer.\"I would like to emphasize the fact that being 2-0 down at halftime was a fair reflection of how the game went,\" he said. \"But I have been on the opposite side, that my team was much better than the other team, we were 1-0 up and then maybe not scoring the second one and the other team gets a set piece, it's 1-1 and then all of a sudden things change. This can happen in football.\"I constantly felt if we were managing to keep maybe 1-0 down until halftime, we can maybe adjust a few things, which was definitely necessary because we were constantly coming one or two players short in the midfield because Doku and [Nico] O'Reilly gave us a lot of problems with the two of them. Then 1-1 would have been the biggest gift we could get at halftime because, in my opinion, the second half was a different game, but being 2-0 down and later 3-0 down that maybe doesn't give a good reflection of how things would have went if it would have been 1-1.\"\nReferee body PGMOL said that Van Dijk's goal had been ruled out because Robertson had been \"deemed to be making an obvious action directly in front of the goalkeeper\" and the laws of the game do make reference to it being an offside offensee to make \"an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball.\" Whether Robertson's duck did so for Donnarumma is up for debate.Whether that goal stood may not have made much of a difference anyway, as Slot himself acknowledged. On the occasion of Pep Guardiola's 1000th game in charge, his team were as irresistible as they have been in a great many of the past 549 in which he has managed City. He said, \"Thank you to the players and staff for giving me an incredible present against the most important opponent we faced in my time here. It has been a special night with my kids here.\"The stakes of this frequently totemic game had only been raised further on Saturday night when Arsenal dropped their first points since September with a 2-2 draw at Sunderland. Victory for City moved them within four points of the league leaders. Liverpool, meanwhile, have five defeats from their opening 11 games and are now eight points off the top.\nAsked about the opportunity that had opened up for City after Sunderland's late equalizer, Guardiola said, \"I think Liverpool and us said, 'Oh wow, Arsenal dropped points finally and conceded two goals.' I said to the players not to do it because yesterday Arsenal didn't win. Do it because we believe in ourselves that we can play against the champions of England and show them we are ready to be there with them this season. Today we proved it – especially in the first half.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MANCHESTER -- Maybe it won't click for Liverpool. At the very least, it is hard to see how it is not too late for this season to coalesce into a sustained defense of the Premier League crown. It isn't just the eight-point deficit to the league leaders, a gap only one less than that which looked unbridgeable for Arsenal at this stage of last season. That isn't even the half of it.The profound problem for Arne Slot now, even after a 3-0 loss at Manchester City, is that the early-season skirmishes are over, the time to work oneself into the season long since past. Most of his squad will jet off to Europe and beyond for the final international window of 2025. When they return, they will do so to a team that has not addressed the issues that have been apparent since the Community Shield. This team cannot defend its flanks. If Mohamed Salah does not play well, neither do Liverpool, who spent $100 million-plus on three attacking players to ready themselves for a new era. From front to back, those who have kept to the standards established last season number in the minority.It would be easy for Slot to point to the decisions that went against his side, chief among them the baffling decision to disallow Virgil van Dijk's well-placed header because Andrew Robertson had been making what PGMOL termed \"an obvious action\" in Gianluigi Donnarumma's vicinity. He might also ponder how different this game would have been if Cody Gakpo had turned in at the back post five minutes before Jeremy Doku got the goal this performance of the season deserved.To do so would be to focus on the discolored leaves on one tree while around him the forest burns. This game might have been different if Liverpool scored their best chance or if Michael OIiver had had a different view of Robertson's positioning. It might have been worse if Erling Haaland had taken a bit more time over an early penalty, if Doku's leg had been a little longer to meet Nico O'Reilly's peach of a cross. Four or more wouldn't have flattered City, even if the expected goals suggest otherwise. \nScrub out the missed penalty and this game looks even in xG terms. It didn't feel it in the slightest, even in a second half where Pep Guardiola was far less impressed. The hosts might not have padded out their shot stats with the Haaland and Nico Gonzalez goals, but they were breezing into the penalty box in the first half, 10 entries to Liverpool's four. A late chance for Salah might have balanced out the xG but the game had long since tilted away from this shadow of their best selves.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            And yes, Liverpool had looked like the team of old on Tuesday night in a deserved win over Real Madrid. Perhaps, in retrospect, that game would have looked very different if Conor Bradley hadn't played out of his skin or if Vinicius Junior had been a little more purposeful in his attacking. It was Bradley's misfortune Sunday to run into Doku at his most devastating, the City No. 11 completing seven take-ons (it felt like more) in the 74 minutes before Guardiola opted to call time on the bully ball. Liverpool ended this match with four.The problem wasn't Bradley. There are maybe a handful of fullbacks in world football who could have dealt with Doku in his current form. Liverpool threw two at him, but Dominik Szoboszlai was no more effective a shield. On the rare occasions where Salah did track back, you could see why Slot was so prepared to let him shade the defending last season.\nThat came with a presumption of output that can probably be parked for now. Like Liverpool as a whole, he seemed to be whirring back into life with dribble-heavy games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid, but after this match, it is still worth asking if those are the exceptions rather than the norm. Salah wasn't bad per se, he ended this game with a hand in six of Liverpool's seven shots and 0.44 of a meager 0.71 xG. He just wasn't the best footballer on the planet. That has been a problem for Slot ever since the Champions League elimination at Paris Saint-Germain's hands.He is not the only one to have dropped off. It was clear on Tuesday how effective the old midfield of Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister can be when all three were humming, but it only took Mac Allister looking leggy again for the center to lose its hold on proceedings. Meanwhile, Ibrahima Konate is not exactly having a Salah-esque contract year. If his mind has already begun drifting to the Bernabeu, he might want to consider that Real Madrid will be watching his performances this season.This, then, was a lot. And it was a lot that should be familiar to Liverpool. Opponents flying in behind their fullbacks had been a game-by-game occurrence before those back-to-back wins. Eighteen games into the season, though, those controlled and authoritative performances look like the exception, rather than the rule. They are a sign that this team can reach heights to match the best in Europe, as they could last year. What has changed in their title defense season is their ability to plumb depths no contender should be able to reach. If they are to have even a scintilla of a shot at the Premier League, this cannot happen again. The problem is, however, that it keeps on happening right now.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 10 has already delivered lots of drama.The action kicked off overseas, where the Indianapolis Colts ran wild against the Atlanta Falcons to claim a high-scoring win in Berlin (more on that below). But it got plenty wacky as the day wore on, as evidenced by the Miami Dolphins cruising past the rival Buffalo Bills in an unexpectedly one-sided AFC East showdown. Then there was the Houston Texans overcoming a three-score deficit to the rival Jacksonville Jaguars, complete with a walk-off touchdown by defensive lineman Sheldon Rankins.And that's not even accounting for some of the other madness of Sunday's schedule, such as the rebuilding New Orleans Saints blanking their own division rivals, the Baltimore Ravens clawing within one game of .500 thanks to a sloppy but resilient showing against the Minnesota Vikings, and the Chicago Bears improving to 6-3 by downing the New York Giants.Which players, coaches and teams stood out the most, for better and worse? Here are some of Week 10's biggest winners and losers:\nWinner: Dan CampbellThe Detroit Lions were stunned in an upset loss in Week 9. No problem. Campbell had his boys revved up and ready to dominate on the rebound, and rebound they did, driving the ball all over the old, depleted Washington Commanders defense for a blowout win. Give Jared Goff even reasonable run support, and he'll pick you apart. Against Dan Quinn's front, he got a lot more than reasonable help, with Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery exploding to the tune of more than 200 yards on the ground.Loser: Robert SalehThe San Francisco 49ers need feisty defense these days, with the offense consistently relying upon fill-in Mac Jones to guide Kyle Shanahan's offense, which was once again without an injured Brock Purdy against the Los Angeles Rams. Yes, Saleh has a whittled-down lineup, with stars like Nick Bosa and Fred Warner out due to injury. But he had basically no answers for Matthew Stafford on Sunday, struggling to find good secondary matchups as the Rams' gunslinger torched the 49ers for four scores.Winner: Jonathan Taylor's MVP caseThe Indianapolis Colts running back was already among midyear favorites for the NFL's top honor. Then he ripped off 286 scrimmage yards, including 244 on the ground, against the Atlanta Falcons to headline the league's first-ever Berlin game. The highlight was an 82-yard scoring scamper, but this is the kind of thing Taylor's been doing all year as the centerpiece of Shane Steichen's rejuvenated attack. No one -- not even elite quarterbacks -- has enjoyed such a special start to 2025. Four years after clearing 1,800 rushing yards as a young breakout, this ball carrier might win the Colts the AFC South with his own legs.  \nLoser: Justin JeffersonThis is for multiple reasons. No. 1: His quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, fell right back to Earth after a resilient Week 9 upset of the Detroit Lions, heaving up a handful of desperation balls to afford the Baltimore Ravens easy takeaways. But Jefferson was actually part of the problem this time, appearing to let up on McCarthy's first pick rather than try to outmuscle a pair of defenders for a jump ball. Then he all but declined to pursue Marlon Humphrey on the second pick, which occurred because Jefferson slipped on a deep route in the first place. It was an unusually passive look for the Minnesota Vikings' star receiver, who's typically above criticism.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 10 grades: Bills get an 'F' for embarrassing loss to Dolphins, Patriots earn 'B+' for big win\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Mike VrabelIn Buffalo, the Bills played down to their competition on Sunday, with Sean McDermott failing to parlay a Josh Allen-led attack into victory against the lowly Miami Dolphins. The Bills' chief rivals did precisely the opposite, proving a formidable foe for the feisty Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Under Vrabel's direction, New England's defense got to Baker Mayfield when it counted, and Josh McDaniels finally unleashed TreVeyon Henderson as explosive run support for Drake Maye, who once again tossed a couple of beautiful deep shots. Just over halfway through his first year running the Patriots, Vrabel is well on his way to the postseason.Loser: Bryce YoungIt's sad, because Young registers as a genuinely likable leader in Carolina, complete with requisite poise for the occasional late-game comeback. But physically, as a passer, this just can't go on much longer for the Panthers if Dave Canales and Co. intend to be taken seriously. It's not just the unusually small build (5-10, 205) that created plenty of pre-draft skeptics; it's the stuck-in-mud speed of his operation that makes interceptions thrown right to the opposing defense look like part of Carolina's plan. This was apparent in an ugly 17-7 loss to the New Orleans Saints, in which counterpart Tyler Shough flashed difference-making traits.\nWinner: Mike MacdonaldOne thing we don't talk enough about: the Seattle Seahawks' surge, not only as new NFC West frontrunners but possible Super Bowl contenders. Maybe that will change after Sunday. Macdonald's defense got off to a rip-roaring start against the rival Arizona Cardinals, scoring a pair of touchdowns to help Seattle jump out to a 35-0 lead ... by midway through the second quarter. And Sam Darnold, the gunslinger at the helm of the offense, was once again razor sharp out of the gate, feeding No. 1 target Jaxon Smith-Njigba to render Arizona helpless. Macdonald and his staff are making the most of a balanced lineup across the board.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        If you were hoping for another Ole Miss Rebel to head north and become the next head coach of the New York Giants, you might be out of luck. ",
    "body": "\n        If you were hoping for another Ole Miss Rebel to head north and become the next head coach of the New York Giants, you might be out of luck. As current coach Brian Daboll currently stands on shaky ground in East Rutherford, there has been a natural question as to who could fill his shoes if New York (2-8) were to part ways with him. Given the emergence of rookie sensation Jaxson Dart as a franchise cornerstone at quarterback, folks have drawn the logical line to giving Lane Kiffin a call to see if he'd want to reunite with his former quarterback and return to the NFL. While it makes sense on paper, judging by what Brandon Dart, Jaxson's father, had to say about that possible reunion, it doesn't sound like a realistic option. \"As we were texting on our Kiffin-Dart family text thread, because I think Boomer Esiason had said something in the media today that maybe they should throw out a potential coaching (offer) to Kiffin, and he just sent it over with a smirk and just said, 'It's too cold in New York for me.' It's just kind of funny,\" Brandon Dart told the \"Bleav in Ole Miss\" podcast, via the New York Post. \n\"But we have our weekly interactions with him and his family, and Jaxson holds high regard. I think Kiffin is one of his most trusted allies, and I think he uses him for advice in a lot of different ways, so there's constant communication between them, even today, and there's a lot of that between our families. I don't think we could have asked for a more special coach relationship between our family and our son, so we're very, very grateful for coach Kiff.\"\nKiffin coached Dart for three years at Ole Miss, which included a stellar senior season in 2024 with the quarterback throwing for 4,279 yards and 29 touchdowns while completing 69.3% of his throws. That tutelage helped him become a first-round pick at the 2025 NFL Draft, and, given the close ties they share, it would make sense for New York to see if he'd be interested in the job. While weather might be a factor for Kiffin, so is the current landscape in college football. There are a number of high-profile jobs open, including at LSU, Penn State, and Florida, where he could be a leading candidate. He could also simply stay put at Ole Miss, where he currently has the Rebels in contention for the College Football Playoff. \nEven with Kiffin as a long shot, the mere fact that this is a conversation highlights how hot the seat is under Daboll at the moment. New York finds itself after Week 10 dead last in the NFC East at 2-8, and the club is currently on a four-game losing streak. That streak includes a 33-32 loss to the Broncos in Week 7, where the Giants allowed Denver to score all of those points in a frantic fourth-quarter comeback. If Daboll, who is 20-40-1 in his 61 regular-season games as head coach of the Giants, doesn't show signs of turning it around between now and the end of the season, it could force owner John Mara's hand to make a change. And if that change isn't toward someone like Kiffin, let's highlight three other possible options. \nJesse MinterCurrent role: Defensive coordinator, Los Angeles ChargersOwnership and fans alike may want an offensive-minded head coach to further cater to Dart's development, but don't sleep on a guy like Jesse Minter, either. New York has invested heavily along the defensive line by acquiring the likes of Brian Burns, signing Dexter Lawrence to a big-money extension, and drafting Abdul Carter and Kayvon Thibodeaux inside the top five of the NFL Draft in recent years. That unit has the potential to be among the best in the NFL, and could reach that with someone like Minter at the helm, which would, in turn, help Dart and the offense. Minter, who was the defensive coordinator at the University of Michigan and followed Jim Harbaugh to the Los Angeles Chargers in the same role, has presided over some dominant defenses. In 2024, the Chargers ranked No. 1 in points allowed and are No. 6 in the league in yards allowed in 2025 (entering Week 10). Kliff KingsburyCurrent role: Offensive coordinator, Washington CommandersLast offseason, we saw former Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson accept a head coaching job in the division with Chicago, so maybe Kingsbury could be the latest to follow that track. Kingsbury has done wonders for the Commanders offense with a young Jayden Daniels, and could bring a similar boost to Dart's development in New York. On top of being one of the top offensive minds in the NFL, he also comes with prior head coaching experience, leading the Arizona Cardinals from 2019 to 2022. Kingsbury went just 28-37-1 over that tenure, but it did include an 11-6 record in 2021. \nKlint KubiakCurrent role: Offensive coordinator, Seattle SeahawksKubiak is expected to be a popular name this upcoming hiring cycle, especially after he has turned the Seattle Seahawks offense into one of the best in the league. Entering Week 10, Sam Darnold is playing at an MVP level and averaging 9.6 yards per attempt. Meanwhile, Jaxon Smith-Njigba currently leads the NFL with 948 yards receiving and is on pace to be the league's first 2,000-yard receiver. Could he work similar magic with Dart and a healthy Malik Nabers with the Giants? \n            ",

    "body": "\n        AFC contenders meet on 'Sunday Night Football' in Week 10 when the Los Angeles Chargers host the Pittsburgh Steelers at 8:20 p.m. ET. Offensive linemen aren't part of the NFL DFS player pool, but Los Angeles has lost both starting tackles -- Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt -- for the season. That certainly can impact the outlook for players like Justin Herbert, Kimani Vidal and Keenan Allen.Can you trust Los Angeles skill players in your NFL DFS lineups, and which Steelers, such as Aaron Rodgers, Jaylen Warren or DK Metcalf, should you target with your NFL DFS picks in what could be more of a defensive-oriented battle (over/under of 44.5)? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Chargers vs. Steelers on 'Sunday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

Herbert has spread it around this season with four pass catchers entering this matchup with 32 or more receptions. McConkey, however, has the slight team lead in total receiving yards (524). His trend line is pointing up as well. After recording just one game of 50 yards or more of receiving in the first five weeks, McConkey has averaged 83 yards per game in his past four outings. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Part of McClure's optimal NFL DFS strategy includes rostering Steelers running back Jaylen Warren. He's coming off a two-touchdown game and has provided a high Fantasy floor all season. Warren has at least 63 scrimmage yards or a score in every game this season, while run defense is the Chargers' weakness. It ranks 27th in yards per carry allowed, and two of the last three offensive touchdowns that L.A. has allowed have come to opposing running backs. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Steelers vs. ChargersMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday Night Football.

    "body": "\nThis season's edition of the UEFA Women's Champions League has been defined by surprise results and as teams enter Matchday 3, the theme of the week just might be whether or not some of them can live up to the hype.Case in point: five teams have two wins out of two to start the league phase, some names on the list more surprising than others. Heavyweights Barcelona and OL Lyonnes headline the group but the list is rounded out by Real Madrid, Wolfsburg and Manchester United, rising above the likes of Chelsea and reigning champions Arsenal after middling starts to the competition. While the onus is on the teams who have surprised with perfect starts, there is plenty of pressure on the Blues and the Gunners to reverse course as they approach the midway point of the league phase.The week's fixture list seems designed to test the sides with a point to prove – Arsenal now have three wins in their last four and can extend the streak against a middling Bayern Munich side, while Wolfsburg have one of the stiffest challenges of all in Lyon, each of them aiming to extend their perfect starts in the Champions League. Manchester United, meanwhile, also target a third win in a row against the winless Paris Saint-Germain, one of five teams with zero points so far.Here's what you need to know before tuning into this week's action.How to watchParamount+ will have every minute of Women's Champions League action this week, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will provide supplemental coverage. Each day's coverage kicks off with the UEFA Women's Champions League Today pre-match show on Paramount+ and CBS Sports Network, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have select matches. Coverage comes to a close with the UEFA Women's Champions League Today post-match show on Paramount+ and CBS Sports Network, and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have a new edition of Scoreline each day.How the new format worksThe league phase will make its way to the UEFA Women's Champions League this season, the competition expanded from the 16 to 18 teams for the new format. Each team will play six games during the league phase, with the top four teams directly booking their tickets for the quarterfinals. Eight more teams will qualify for the knockout phase playoffs, with teams ranked fifth through eighth set to face those ranked ninth through 12th for a spot in the quarterfinals. From there, the competition resumes a familiar knockout format with all eyes on the May 24 final at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo, Norway.Matchday 3 TV scheduleAll times U.S./EasternTuESDAY, NOV. 11TIMEHOW TO WATCHUEFA Women's Champions League Today pre-match12:30 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkRoma vs. Valarenga12:45 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkUEFA Women's Champions League Today pre-match2 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network; CBS Sports Network from 2:35 p.m.Real Madrid vs. Paris FC3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkSt. Polten vs. Chelsea3 p.m.Paramount+OL Lyonnes vs. Wolfsburg3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkUEFA Women's Champions League Today post-match5 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkScoreline5 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkWEDNESDAY, NOV. 12TIMEHOW TO WATCHUEFA Women's Champions League Today pre-match12 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkCBS Sports Golazo Matchday12:30 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkBarcelona vs. OH Leuwen12:45 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkBayern Munich vs. Arsenal12:45 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkUEFA Women's Champions League Today pre-match2:35 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkCBS Sports Golazo Matchday2:45 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkBenfica vs. Twente3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkAtletico Madrid vs. Juventus3 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkManchester United vs. Paris Saint-Germain3 p.m.Paramount+UEFA Women's Champions League Today post-match5 p.m.Paramount+, CBS Sports NetworkScoreline5 p.m.CBS Sports Golazo NetworkStorylines for Matchday 3Can Wolfsburg withstand Lyon?: Five teams enter Matchday 3 with perfect records but that number will shrink over the course of the week, with Wolfsburg traveling to Lyon in one of the most anticipated games on the schedule. It is the latest edition of a historic rivalry in the Women's Champions League, these two facing off in four finals in the last decade and change, though the two sides have headed in contrasting directions since they last met in the 2020 final. It means Lyon are the overwhelming favorites in this one – manager Jonatan Giraldez has a wide range of talented players to call upon including rising U.S. women's national team star Lily Yohannes, who is just a few weeks removed from her impressive long distance goal in their 3-0 win over St. Polten on Matchday 2. Wolfsburg goalkeeper Stina Johannes, who started both games as Germany advanced to the UEFA Women's Nation's League final after a 3-2 aggregate win over France, may be a key player as the visitors aim to keep Lyon's star-studded attack at bay.Can Manchester United keep this up?: Manchester United's first-ever Women's Champions League campaign is off to an impressive start, the Red Devils now in a strong position to win a third successive game as they host an out-of-form Paris Saint-Germain side on Wednesday. This one could be decided by fine margins since neither team has been much of an attacking force in Europe this season – United have two goals in two games, while PSG have just one. There will be a lot of focus on the goalkeepers in that case, with 2022 Women's Euro winner Mary Earps in between the sticks for PSG and likely to be tasked with Melvine Malard and her ex-England teammate Ella Toone. This game will also be another showcase for United shot-stopper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who is the only goalkeeper with two clean sheets in the competition so far. Tullis-Joyce is one of the leading contenders to the USWNT's new starter in goal, her club form playing a sizable role in her upward trajectory. It could also be a key determinant in Emma Hayes' choice – the head coach has said in no uncertain terms that club form is the foundation for opportunities with the national team.\n            ",

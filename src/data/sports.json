    "body": "\n        Efe Ajagba signed with Zuffa Boxing after a frustrating draw against Martin Bakole that many observers believed Ajagba deserved to win. On Sunday, Ajagba made good on a new opportunity with new promoters, finishing former IBF heavyweight champion Charles Martin with a fourth-round TKO.Martin controlled much of the action through the first three rounds, moving around the perimeter of the ring and forcing Ajagba to come to him. Ajagba didn't utilize a jab while trying to close distance, allowing Martin to land counters and avoid the predictable right hands from Ajagba.For all of Martin's success, heavyweight is a division where things can change in an instant, and that's exactly what happened in Round 3. With Martin moving along the ropes once again, Ajagba landed a heavy right hand that put Martin on the canvas. Martin beat the count and survived the round, but was right back down in the opening 30 seconds of the fourth round, again from a right hand.Ajagba remained patient, hunting down Martin and continuing to land flurries of big shots until the referee was forced to jump in and halt the bout at the 1:11 mark of Round 4.\nZuffa Boxing's heavyweight division is very much still in development, but Ajagba entered the fight on the fringes of the top 10 in the world, and a big knockout win over a former world champion cements him as a man who will likely be competing for Zuffa's heavyweight title in the future.Let's take a look at what else happened at Zuffa Boxing 03.Umar Dzambekov def. Ahmed Elbiali via KO, Round 2Dzambekov dominated a fight that was expected to be one of the best of the night. In the opening frame, Dzambekov was able to work a pinpoint jab and straight, often dipping down to the body with his shots. It was clear from the early moments that the skill differential was massive and that Elbiali's only chance was likely to land a single, fight-changing shot.Unfortunately for Elbiali, that big shot came from Dzambekov. As Elbiali attempted to move forward through Dzambekov's shots, Dzambekov landed a crushing uppercut that sent Elbiali's eyes rolling up into his head as he crashed to the canvas. Elbiali's feet were twitching as the referee began his count, making it clear the fight was over in that moment.\nDzambekov looked like a man with all of the skills to be one of the major players on the still-developing Zuffa Boxing roster. And a fight with Radivoje Kalajdzic could be a huge one for Zuffa Boxing's light heavyweight division.\nJaybrio Pe Benito def. Abel Mejia via TKO, Round 3The main card got off to a wild start as Pe Benito scored a massive upset knockout of Mejia in the third round of their lightweight bout. The fight got off to a fast start with both men landing meaningful shots in toe-to-toe exchanges before things took a massive turn in the second round. As the two exchanged again, Pe Benito landed a short left hook that sent Mejia to the canvas.Mejia beat the referee's count and the bell sounded to end the round. Mejia was not given a chance to get back on track in the third round, as Pe Benito landed a crushing straight right hand that sent Mejia back to the canvas. Mejia again rose to his feet, but this time was unsteady and the referee was forced to halt the action less than a minute into the round.\nPe Benito was a big underdog at +500 but now owns one of the biggest knockouts in Zuffa Boxing's short history, though maybe not quite as thunderous as Dzambekov's uppercut one fight later.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 24-hour window to appeal the results of the 2026 Winter Olympics ice dance competition passed, and United States Figure Skating did not appeal the controversial ruling that led to a silver-medal finish for Team USA pair Madison Chock and Evan Bates. A USFS official said to USA Today that the association did not file an inquiry by the Feb. 12 deadline.Chock and Bates finished a mere 0.43 points behind the French team of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron in the ice dance event, and the judges' scores drew public scrutiny. The American pair trailed narrowly after the rhythm dance portion of the competition, and while five of nine judges awarded them a higher score than the French duo in the free dance, they still came up less than a point short. French judge Jezabel Dabouis gave the French team a score more than seven points higher than Chock and Bates.\"There has been a lot of thoughtful, and at times emotional, discussion about the ice dance competition in Milan,\" USFS CEO Matt Farrell said to USA Today. \"Working together with Madi and Evan after the Games, we will have thoughtful and intentional discussions about the best way to support them and the future of the sport. For now, we plan to join them in supporting the success of U.S. Figure Skating in Milan.\"Dabouis gave Chock and Bates a 129.74-point score for their ice dance routine. She awarded Beaudry and Cizeron 137.45 points. The difference between those marks was the largest of any judge, and the score given to the Americans was the lowest of the judges.\nThat scoring decision raised eyebrows and sparked concerns that Dabouis unfairly favored her home country's team. But the International Skating Union issued a statement defending the judges' decisions.\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,\" the ISU said, per the Associated Press, adding it has \"full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.\"Chock and Bates earned their first Olympic ice dance medal but were favored to win gold, especially considering they entered the free dance in lockstep with the leaders. They won a gold medal in the team event earlier in the Games. Chock expressed disappointment with the controversial scoring decision that stood between him and a third career Olympic gold medal.\n\"I think it would definitely be helpful if it's more understandable for the viewers to see more transparent judging and understand what's really going on,\" Chock said in an interview with CBS News. \"It's also important for the skaters that the judges be vetted and reviewed and that they are also putting out their best performance. There's a lot on the line for the skaters when they're out there giving it their all. We also deserve to have the judges giving it their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- After the first contest of the 2026 NBA All-Star Game -- which featured a brand new format with two USA teams and one World team -- ended, Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards was asked by the NBC broadcast about wanting the ball on the first possession of overtime. Edwards didn't directly answer the question, but his response was telling.Edwards admitted that Victor Wembanyama \"set the tone,\" and it was hard not to match his energy.  It was a stark contrast to Edwards' comments on the eve of the NBA All-Star Game, when he directly said  \"no\" when asked if the intensity from the Olympics in 2024 could carry over to this format.Edwards had every reason -- like most NBA fans in attendance and watching at home -- to be skeptical. After all, there have been more lowlights from the actual All-Star Game itself than highlights in recent years. It's clear the players agree the format was a success, and NBA commissioner Adam Silver should be hand-delivering thank-you notes to Wembanyama for helping make it happen.\"He set the tone,\" Edwards said postgame about Wembanyama. \"It was definitely competitive with all three teams. I feel like the old heads played hard, too. They were playing real good defense. But yeah, he set the tone, man. It woke me up for sure.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Winners and losers of revitalized NBA All-Star Game: Kawhi goes off, Wemby makes mark, KAT gets picked on\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEdwards had an All-Star Game to remember. He scored eight points in the final game against the USA Stripes team and was named All-Star Game MVP. Edwards best showing of the game came in that opening game against Team World, when he dropped 13 points in an overtime victory.The final game of All-Star Weekend turned out to be anticlimactic, but the other three games were entertaining, competitive and intense. Take it from Knicks star Jalen Brunson. What Wembanyama did wasn't just felt by one player.\"I think Wemby's a leader,\" Brunson said. \"The way he carries himself is fantastic for this game. I think he's done a great job and you see what his impact is on and off the court around this game.\"\nDespite being in just his third year in the league, Wembanyama's impact is already being felt throughout the league. Last year's All-Star Game was mostly a snooze fest, but the new format injected new life into the event.\"It's the game we love,\" Wembanyama said. \"It's the game I personally cherish. Being competitive is the least I can do.\"The format of having each team play each other once in a 12-minute quarter setting certainly brought more juice than usual. Clippers star Kawhi Leonard dropped 31 points to help Team Stripes advance in a game against Team World. Spurs guard De'Aaron Fox knocked down a 3-pointer at the buzzer just seconds after Edwards hit a clutch shot of his own to help the USA Stripes team win its opening game. All teams actually played defense.\nFans at home might've been confused by the format, and for good reason. Even players were trying to figure out the rules as the game was happening, which is why Leonard pitched afterward for the traditional East vs. West format to return.\"I think it was good,\" Leonard said. \"I didn't really figure it out until we got here. As the game was going on, trying to figure out the records. ... I thought it was good, but I still think going back to East vs. West will be great and I think guys will compete still.\"Love or hate the new format, it might just be here to stay. Nonetheless, the new format was a breath of fresh air for all parties involved. All-Star Saturday Night -- one of the premier events on the NBA calendar -- might've been a wash, but the All-Star Game itself made up for it.\n\"It was a step up in the competitive department compared to last season,\" Rockets star Kevin Durant said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA All-Star Game is officially back. After years of embarrassing efforts, even by exhibition game standards, the players finally delivered a showcase that they, and the league, can be proud of -- even if the championship game of the new Team USA vs. Team World format was a bit of a dud. The USA Stars, the younger roster of American All-Stars, destroyed Team Stripes, to more veteran American group, 47-21, in the championship to lift the trophy after a thrilling round-robin series. Anthony Edwards, who poured in 32 points across Team Stars' three games, was named MVP, becoming the first Minnesota Timberwolves player to earn the honor since Kevin Garnett in 2003. After a fun night of action inside the Intuit Dome, here's a look at the winners and losers from the 2026 All-Star Game. Winner: Victor WembanyamaIn the lead up to Sunday's showcase, the French phenom made it clear that he was not happy with what the event had turned into in recent years, and was going to do his best to change it. \n\"I want to push the great players of this sport to play in the All-Star game just as hard as I will,\" Wembanyama said in January. \"We'll see how it goes, but if they don't play hard, I'll do it without them.\"He expanded on those thoughts on Saturday. \"Exclamation-point plays, playing in a solid manner and sharing the ball with energy,\" Wembanyama said, when asked how he planned to set a competitive tone. \"If you share that energy, people feel like they have a responsibility to share it back to you.\"\nWembanyama walked the walk right from the opening tip of the first game. Within the first two minutes, he threw down a huge slam, scored the first seven points for Team World and swatted a Jalen Duren attempt into the crowd. When Team World lost the opener in overtime because of a bad defensive rotation, he threw his hands up and stormed off the court like he had just lost a playoff game. \nEveryone else followed suit. \"I ain't gonna lie, Wemby set the tone,\" Anthony Edwards said. \"He came out and played hard, so it's hard not to match that.\" Winner: The NBABetween all of the tanking discourse, some of Adam Silver's comments during his Saturday press conference and a disastrous All-Star Saturday Night, the league was facing more public criticism than it had in a long time. As an entity, the last thing the NBA needed was another lifeless All-Star Game. Instead, the players delivered the most memorable mid-season showcase since 2020, and one of the most competitive events ever. \nThe first three games of the round robin format were awesome and all went down to the wire. Team Stars defeated Team World in overtime of Game 1 on a game-ending 3-pointer by Scottie BarnesTeam Stripes defeated Team Stars in Game 2 on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by De'Aaron FoxTeam Stripes defeated Team World in Game 3 on a last-second 3-pointer by Kawhi LeonardThe championship turned into a rout, as the much younger Team Stars cruised past the veteran-filled Team Stripes, who seemed to be out of gas. The last few minutes of that contest looked a lot like the previous All-Star Games. But even though the night ended on a low, the overall product was much better than anyone expected, and spared the league another wave of criticism. Loser: The championship gameAs mentioned, the new All-Star Game format pitting the best American players against the best international players was working to perfection through the round robin format, thanks to a big assist from Wembanyama. \nThe two American squads, Team Stars and Team Stripes, advanced to the championship, and everything was set up for a thrilling conclusion to the best All-Star Game in years. So, of course, we got a blowout. The younger Team Stars had way more juice left in their legs, and they jumped out to an early double-digit lead. Team Stripes briefly gave itself some hope with back-to-back 3s from LeBron James and Jalen Brunson to cut the deficit down to nine with seven minutes to play, but never got closer. While the night was an overall success, the way it ended was definitely a bummer. \nWinner: Kawhi LeonardLeonard has had a strange six months. During the offseason, Leonard was the subject of an investigative report by Pablo Torre that alleged the Clippers star had received $28 million via a fradulent marketing agreement that allowed his team to circumvent the salary cap. The NBA's investigation into the matter has not yet concluded. Shortly after the season got underway, Leonard was forced to the sidelines for nearly three weeks with ankle and foot sprains. The Clippers went 2-8 without him, part of a disastrous start to the season for the team, which was expecting to get back to the playoffs. A few days before Christmas, Leonard began one of the best stretches of his career, which included three 40-point outings in the span of five games, including a career-high 55 points in a win over the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons. The hot streak kicked off a stunning turnaround for the Clippers, who went from 6-21 to 26-28 in the span of two months to climb into Play-In Tournament position in the Western Conference. \nDespite an incredible last few weeks, Leonard wasn't initially named to the game, but eventually made it as an injury replacement. He proved to be a wise pick by Silver, and put on an incredible show in front of the Clippers fans on Sunday, as he helped Team Stripes reach the championship game. In Game 3 of the round-robin format, Leonard poured in 31 of Team Stripes' 48 points on 11-of-13 shooting from the field, including a 6-of-7 effort from 3-point range, and hit a game-winning triple over Karl-Anthony Towns (more on that later) in the closing seconds. Leonard's 12-minute bonanza was one of the best parts of the night, and was yet another reminder that when he's healthy, there are few better players in the world. \n\"It was great. Happy that Adam [Silver] let me in. That's what the home crowd wanted to see. I'm glad I was able to do something in that game,\" Leonard said. \nWinner: Anthony EdwardsEarlier this weekend, Edwards was blunt when asked for his thoughts on the state of the All-Star Game (\"It is what it is at this point\") and whether the new format would make a difference (\"No\"). But by the end of the first game, Edwards had changed his tune. \"I ain't gonna lie, Wemby set the tone,\" Edwards said. \"He came out and played hard, so it's hard not to match that.\" Edwards can at times appear aloof and \"too cool for school\" during press conferences, but on the court he's one of the league's most fierce competitors. It's unlikely that he went into Sunday night with a plan to play hard, but once Wembanyama had laid down a marker, he couldn't help but respond. \n\"Yeah, [Wembanyama] set the tone, man, and it woke me up, for sure,\" Edwards added after the game. Edwards had 13 points in Game 1, 11 points in Game 2 and eight points in the championship, for a total of 32 on the night, and was named All-Star MVP for his efforts. \nLoser: Karl-Anthony TownsTowns spends all season hearing about his defensive deficiencies, and how they might prevent the New York Knicks from winning a championship. All-Star Weekend is supposed to be a respite from that sort of talk, but somehow Towns found himself on the receiving end of even more criticism. \nGame 1 between Team World and Team Stars went to overtime, and instead of putting any time on the clock, a winning score of five points was set. Team World was up 3-2, and should have been playing a no-3s defense, but Towns for some reason rotated into the paint to try and stop Jalen Duren, which left Scottie Barnes wide open from behind the arc. Duren found Barnes for the game-winning shot. \nIn Game 3 between Team World and Team Stripes, the score was tied in the closing seconds when Towns got switched onto Leonard. Towns actually played pretty good defense, but Leonard drained a game-winning 3 right in his face. \nPoor Towns. The first time anyone has been expected to show any sort of effort on that end of the floor in the All-Star Game and he immediately finds himself on a defensive lowlight reel.\n            ",

There are questions that loom large for Barcelona, though, especially with Thursday's defeat to Atletico Madrid still top of mind.Hansi Flick's side return to play for the first time since a startling 4-0 defeat to Atleti in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals, one in which Atleti unrelentingly exposed Barcelona's weaknesses – perhaps because those vulnerabilities have been easy to spot over the course of the season. Barcelona's defensive shakiness has been a defining feature since Flick took over at the start of the 2024-25 season, a frailty usually overcome by a mighty attack. It is an approach that guided them to the domestic double last season but is not foolproof. It may come as little surprise that a team like Atleti could find a way through Barcelona's porous defense but there have been openings for a wide range of opponents including Club Brugge, who Barcelona tied 3-3 with in the UEFA Champions League, and Slavia Praha, who kept things nervy despite losing 4-2 in the end.It perhaps comes as little surprise, then, that Flick's all gas, no breaks strategy is under scrutiny as Barcelona return to league play on Monday. Players reportedly told Flick that he should adjust his tactical preferences occasionally in the wake of the loss to Atleti, according to The AThletic, especially when the likes of Raphinha and Pedri are unavailable to pitch in from an attacking standpoint. Flick, meanwhile, took issue with the players' intensity levels during the first half.How to watch Girona vs. Barcelona, oddsDate: Monday, Feb. 15 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadi Montilivi -- Girona, SpainTV: ESPN2 | Live stream: ESPN SelectOdds: Girona +600; Draw +470; Barcelona -290Monday's trip to Girona may not provide the answer but as the season progresses, Flick once again faces an existential question about whether or not his preferred style has its limits. The visitors will be the oddsmakers' favorites to take all three points at Girona, in large part because the opponents have their own defensive woes. Girona have conceded 37 goals so far this season, three fewer than the league's worst team in that regard, Levante, putting them just two points above the relegation zone heading into Monday's match. They may like their chances against Barcelona's chaotic back line but even then, Girona are not known for their goalscoring ability – only four teams have fewer than their 22 goals in LaLiga this season.It makes for a favorable situation for Barcelona, who need a win to restore their one point lead over Real Madrid atop the table. Again, though, they are likely to be understaffed – Marcus Rashford and Pedri are dealing with injuries that will keep them out of Monday's match, while there are still question marks around Raphinha's availability. The Brazil international has not played since a win against Elche on January 31 while dealing with a short-term issue, but he did train Friday and could make a much-waited return on Monday.How many minutes he will be able to play is currently unclear, though his importance to the team certainly is not. Ferran Torres, Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski have held down the fort well with 10-plus goals each across all competitions but Raphinha has an oversized impact for Barcelona when he is available. He has 13 goals and five assists in all competitions, a sizable output for someone who has only been able to play 22 games so far this season, almost irreplaceable even though he has spent large chunks of the campaign on the sidelines. Case in point – they have lost just five matches in all competitions this season and Raphinha did not start in any of them, only coming off the bench in one of those matches.Raphinha's return will be a welcome one for Flick and company, who will prefer to call upon him as the push for silverware enters its final stages, and serves as a stark reminder that a closely-contested title race could very much be decided by fine margins, something the comeback of an impactful player should be very helpful with.\n            ",

Still, there are some other significant names near the top of the leaderboard with Collin Morikawa seeking his first win since 2023 as the likes of Jordan Spieth, Sepp Straka, Min Woo Lee and Hideki Matsuyama battle for the winner's share.The $20 million signature event purse at Pebble Beach features a $3.6 million payout going to whomever wins the trophy and all top 10 finishers receiving $525,000 or more.Here's how you'll be able to follow all the action on the picturesque California coast as the final round wraps up at the season's biggest event to this point.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am TV schedule All times Eastern\nRound 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 10:30 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 10:30 a.m. - 8 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports AppLive TV coverage: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\nRadio: 1-6:30 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Zuffa Boxing returns on Sunday with Zuffa Boxing 03 from the Meta APEX in Las Vegas. The event is headlined by a clash between Efe Ajagba and former IBF heavyweight champion Charles Martin.Ajagba is on the verge of being a top 10 heavyweight in the world and likely would already be considered as such had things broken better for him on the scorecards in his most recent fight. That night, Ajagba took on Martin Bakole, seen as one of heavyweight's boogeymen, avoided by most in the division for the difficulties he can present to opponents.Ajagba controlled much of that fight in May 2025, but the scorecards resulted in a majority draw, with one judge scoring the fight 96-94 in Ajagba's favor and the other two ruling the fight a 95-95 draw.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 03 live on Sunday night for no additional fee. Plus, every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nAjagba was rewarded for his performance against Bakole with a proposed IBF title eliminator against Frank Sanchez, who handed Ajagba his lone defeat in a 2021 meeting. Ajagba was unhappy with how the purse bid for the fight shook out and declined to move forward with the bout, ultimately leading to the termination of his contract with Top Rank, which opened the door for the heavyweight contender to sign with Zuffa Boxing.While Martin does hold the distinction of being a former world heavyweight champion, the circumstances of his title reign are unusual.Martin won the IBF title in a 2016 bout with Vyacheslav Glazkov that saw Glazkov unable to continue due to a knee injury suffered during a third-round knockdown. Less than 90 days later, Martin was no longer champion, suffering a second-round knockout to Anthony Joshua.\nMartin has insisted he was \"badly injured\" 10 days before the Joshua fight and continued to chase a rematch for years, rising to the fringes of title contention with a few wins before suffering repeated setbacks in the form of losses to Adam Kownacki, Luis Ortiz and Jared Anderson.After losing to Anderson in July 2023, Martin got back in the win column with a stoppage of unheralded Matthew McKinney the following November. He has not fought since, marking 15 months out of the ring.The light heavyweight co-main event between Umar Dzambekov and Ahmed Elbiali appears to be the standout fight on the card, with unbeaten Dzambekov looking to continue building his resume against a tough out in Elbiali, whose lone loss came to former world champion Jean Pascal.\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of the fight card for Sunday night with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Zuffa Boxing 03 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookEfe Ajagba -1100 vs. Charles Martin +650, heavyweightsUmar Dzambekov-1400 vs. Ahmed Elbiali +700, light heavyweightsAbel Mejia -800 vs. Jaybrio Pe Benito +500, lightweightsLeonardo Ruiz -1400 vs. Casey Streeter +700, middleweightsAntonio Woods -425 vs. Mark Beuke +300, middleweightsOswaldo Molina -1200 vs. Joshua Clark +650, lightweightsEmiliano Alvarado -2500 vs. Devin Gantt +1000, junior featherweightDariial Kuchmenov -3000 vs. Jorge Lagunas +1000, lightweightsWhere to watch Zuffa Boxing 03Date: Feb. 15 | Location: Meta APEX -- Las VegasPrelims begin at 6 p.m. ETMain card begins at 9 p.m. ETWatch live: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionAs a 31-year-old on a six-fight unbeaten streak who was being lined up for a title eliminator, Ajagba is very much a contender at heavyweight. Martin started his career 23-0 and won a world title, but has fallen very much into a spot as a gatekeeper for the division. That's not a knock because divisions benefit from gatekeepers; they're good enough to fend off pretenders, and a win against them carries actual meaning.\nAjagba came up short against Frank Sanchez, which does raise some questions about whether he is ready to fully break through to the upper echelon of heavyweights and if he isn't, Martin is talented enough to knock him down the ladder. But Ajagba's performance against Bakole showed he can handle big, awkward heavyweights who carry some power in their fists.This is a fight set up to get Ajagba a win over a former champion and he should be able to do just that.

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Seattle Seahawks have found their replacement for former offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, and as a bonus, they nabbed him from a division rival in the process. San Francisco 49ers run game coordinator and tight ends coach Brian Fleury is headed to the Super Bowl champions to lead Sam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the rest of the Seattle offense, per NFL Media.The Seahawks lost Kubiak to the Las Vegas Raiders' coach opening, but they didn't go far to find his replacement -- either in terms of distance or approach. Fleury has been coaching in the NFL since 2013 and with the 49ers since 2019, rising in San Francisco from quality control coach to tight ends coach to run game coordinator and tight ends coach. He overlapped with Kubiak, who spent 2023 as the 49ers' pass game coordinator.Though it will be Fleury's first time calling plays, he'll likely bring over several of the elements that the Kyle Shanahan/Klint Kubiak offenses share, including heavy use of under center formations and play action. As run game coordinator and tight ends coach, Fleury worked with Christian McCaffrey, George Kittle and others in San Francisco. McCaffrey had 2,126 yards from scrimmage in 2025, his only season with Fleury as the run game coordinator.The news of Fleury's hiring coincided with ESPN's Adam Schefter reporting the Raiders have hired Seahawks quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko as their offensive coordinator. Janocko was with Kubiak in Seattle and, before that, with the New Orleans Saints.\nThe Seahawks finished third in scoring offense and eighth in total offense in 2025, Kubiak's lone season in Seattle. Mike Macdonald will now hope he's nailed another offensive coordinator hire.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        PEORIA, Ariz. —Nick Castellanos has no regrets about how his time in Philadelphia ended. The newly acquired Padre, signed after his release from the Phillies earlier this week, said he took lessons from the rocky finish.But regret? There's none of that. \"In the moment, I felt how I felt, and I spoke from the heart, and I was honest in every word that I said,\" Castellanos said early Sunday afternoon from the Peoria Sports Complex, San Diego's spring training facility. \"It's not like I was outwardly ever displaying that. I kept it all inside. But when I was asked a question, I shot straight, and then people perceived it how they wanted.\" Perception always trailed Castellanos in Philly, making him a polarizing figure across his four seasons with the Phillies. But the dugout incident in June, reported by The Athletic, when he brought a beer into the dugout and screamed at manager Rob Thomson and hitting coach Kevin Long, didn't earn him much support.That, Castellanos admitted, he wished he handled differently.\"I said I will learn from this,\" Castellanos said. I let the emotions get the best of me in the moment. [Going forward] possibly if I see things that frustrate me or I don't believe are conducive to winning. [It's about ] not letting things just pile up over time so when I address it, it's less emotional.\" \nCastellanos joins an emotional clubhouse. Manny Machado, a friend from their childhood days, is viewed as the leader of the club. Some around the game see that fact as part of the reason why San DIego has yet to reach its potential. Whether Castellanos will only add fuel to what is already a combustible clubhouse will be something to monitor this season.Nonetheless, after vetting Castellanos' sour ending in Philly, A.J. Preller, the Padres' president of baseball operations, decided to take a chance on the veteran. \"We did a lot of homework,\" Preller said. \"Throughout the whole offseason, there was a lot of talk that the Phillies were looking to move him. We talked to a ton of people that have history with Nick. Teammates, coaches, people who have been around him.\" \nSan Diego made Castellanos' role clear, indicating he will DH and play some outfield and possibly first base, a position he has never played in his big league career. With the Padres' outfield set by Fernando Tatis Jr. in right, the position Castellanos is most accustomed to, his playing time in the field could be limited. Still, San Diego is paying only the league minimum of his $20 million salary in hopes he can rediscover the bat that eluded him at times with his former club.Machado is confident that Castellanos will produce. \"For me as a player, seeing it from this side of it, I see a guy who's accomplished a lot,\" added Machado. \"I really don't know the details of what happened over there. Don't really care, honestly. I'm just happy we got him for what we got him for, and he's going to improve our team tremendously.\" San Diego is in an unusual position. The club is in the middle of a sale, and its finances have been reshaped by the collapse of its regional sports network model. Preller, known for handing out hefty deals, was uncharacteristically quiet this offseason with the future of ownership in flux. On the field, you could argue the Padres might have missed their window to win a World Series. Machado will turn 34 in July. Xander Bogaerts turned 33 in October. After presuming that San Diego would be Fernando Tatis' longterm home, a trade down the line isn't out of the question. \nTheir rotation this year, too, leaves a lot to be desired headlined by Nick Pivetta, Michael King, and Joe Musgrove. Spring training will determine the final two spots. Castellanos, however, has his sights set on this season. He spoke about needing a fresh start and how he sensed Game 4 of the NLDS would likely be his last game as a Phillie. He long came to terms with that and with some of the decisions he made during the year.He wants to contribute. He believes he can still do so -- even as he enters his age-34 season coming off of a down one (.250/.294/.400 slash line in 547 at-bats).\nHe does have just one regret overall about his previous stop, though. \"That we didn't win a World Series,\" he said. \"I think winning solves everything. So I think the one thing that I wish would have ended up different is that we would have won.\" He'll now try to change that outcome in San Diego.\n            ",

The league has tried to drum up some more interest from fans and players alike to create a more intriguing event. Last year, that plan fell flat with a mini tournament that featured three All-Star teams and one Rising Stars team. This year, the league is still holding the mini tournament but will move to a USA vs. World format. The league wants to highlight the growing international talent, so we'll see Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and more compete against LeBron James, Kevin Durant and other top American talent. The rosters have already been set, so let's dig into some more details about the new format.\nHow to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockNBA All-Star Game format, explainedThe 25 All-Stars have been divided into three teams (Team World has nine players). There will be two U.S. teams (USA Stars and USA Stripes) and one World team. Detroit Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff will coach USA Stars, while San Antonio Spurs coach Mitch Johnson will lead USA Stripes. Toronto Raptors coach Darko Rajaković will coach Team World.There will be a round-robin tournament of four, 12-minute games. USA Stars and Team World will face off in Game 1. The winner of that game will play USA Stripes in Game 2. The losing team of Game 1 will then play USA Stripes in Game 3. Following the three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 with the chance to be crowned champions of All-Star Weekend.If all three teams have a 1-1 record after the first three games, the point differential from the round-robin games will be used to determine the two teams that advance to the championship game.The All-Star Game has a $1.8 million prize pool. Each player on the championship-winning team gets $125,000. Players on the second-place team get $50,000, while players on the third-place team get $25,000.Here are the rosters for the three All-Star rosters:2026 NBA All-Star rostersUSA StarsUSA StripesTeam WorldScottie BarnesJaylen BrownGiannis AntetokounmpoDevin BookerJalen BrunsonDeni AvdijaCade CunninghamStephen Curry (injured)Luka DončićJalen DurenKevin DurantShai Gilgeous-Alexander (injured)Anthony EdwardsBrandon Ingram (injury replacement)Nikola JokićChet HolmgrenLeBron JamesJamal MurrayJalen JohnsonKawhi LeonardAlperen Sengun (injury replacement)Tyrese MaxeyDonovan MitchellPascal SiakamNorman PowellKarl-Anthony TownsVictor Wembanyama\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas State fired fourth-year basketball coach Jerome Tang on Sunday, a source told CBS Sports. Athletic director Gene Taylor subsequently revealed late Sunday night he made the decision to fire Tang following K-State's loss at houston on Saturday. The move comes less than four days after Tang's postgame rant went viral following an embarrassing 91-62 home loss to Cincinnati on Thursday. a\"This was a decision that was made in the best interest of our university and men's basketball program,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"Recent public comments and conduct, in addition to the program's overall direction, have not aligned with K-State's standards for supporting student-athletes and representing the university. We wish coach Tang and his family all the best moving forward.\"  The Wildcats are 10-15 and in the midst of their second-worst season in the past 20-plus years. Kansas State ranks 101st at KenPom.com and is 1-11 in the Big 12. The team is headed toward a second straight sub-.500 season despite being one of the bigger spenders in the transfer portal the past two offseasons. \nKansas State will attempt to fire Tang for cause. Tang has a buyout of more than $18 million, per the terms of his contract, but Taylor believes Tang's public criticisms of the players and the response that press conference spurred in the national media violated the terms of his contract.Tang released a statement disputing Kansas State's assessment of the program.\"I am deeply disappointed with the university's decision and strongly disagree with the characterization of my termination.  I have always acted with integrity and faithfully fulfilled my responsibilities as head coach,\" Tang said. \"I am grateful to the players, staff, and fans who make this program so special. I remain proud of what we built together and confident that I have always acted in the best interests of the university and our student-athletes.\"  Associate head coach Matthew Driscoll has been named interim head coach for the rest of the season. \nLISTEN: Matt Norlander breaks down Tang's final days at K-State on this emergency edition of the Eye on College Basketball podcast.Tang went 71-57 in less than four seasons on the job, including a 29-39 mark in the Big 12. He was hired in 2022 and an immediate success: He guided the Wildcats to the Elite Eight with a No. 3 seed and finished 26-10 thanks to the dynamic duo of point guard Markquis Nowell and forward Keyontae Johnson. Nowell's 19 assists in a Sweet 16 victory vs. Michigan State at Madison Square Garden set both an NCAA Tournament record and an optimistic tone for the Tang era, but it's been a litany of letdowns ever since.K-State is coming off a 78-64 loss at No. 3 Houston on Saturday. Tang had the players' names removed from the back of their jerseys for that game in a questionable move that followed his criticism of KSU players following the Wildcats' loss to the Bearcats.  \n\"This was embarrassing,\" Tang said Wednesday night at his press conference. \"These dudes do not deserve to wear this uniform. There will be very few of them in it next year. I'm embarrassed for the university, I'm embarrassed for our fans, our student section. It is just ridiculous.\"That's the quote that has Tang's legal team and Kansas State's lawyers set to battle in the weeks ahead. If K-State wins, it won't pay Tang another dime. If it loses, Tang will have more than $18.5 million coming his way. There is also the realistic possibility that the parties wind up settling somewhere in the wide gulf between those two numbers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    GoPowerCat's team of Kansas State insiders are providing on-the-ground updates on every development and insider scoop surrounding the Wildcats.

    "body": "\n        No. 22 BYU has won consecutive games for the first time since early January, but Saturday's 90-86 overtime victory over Colorado came at a price. Veteran guard Richie Saunders sustained a season-ending torn ACL in the win, the team announced Sunday.Saunders, the 2024-25 Big 12 Most Improved Player and the 10th-leading scorer in the conference this season, left the contest after just 45 seconds. He fell awkwardly on a drive-and-kick on the Cougars' opening possession and remained on the floor for several minutes as BYU trainers attended to him. Saunders walked into the locker room under his own power and did not return to action.BYU coach Kevin Young did not provide an update on Saunders' status in his postgame media availability and said he was waiting, along with everyone else, to learn about the severity of the injury.\"Unfortunate news last night -- I tore my ACL, ending my season,\" Saunders said in an Instagram post. \"Thank you for all the thoughts and prayers. They mean more than you know. To end my BYU career like this is heartbreaking. I've loved every moment and every challenge that came with representing the school I love. These past four years have shaped who I am -- on and off the court. Cougar Nation, thank you. Through the ups and downs, you've stuck with me. I'll never forget that.\"My story has never been one of ease. And while I didn't plan for this, my career is not over. I will return with more fight and more grit than before. My goals haven't changed. I don't always understand why things happen the way they do, but I trust that God is in the details. I trust His plan. The next chapter begins the same way I've always lived. Work With Faith.\"\nAlong with Texas Tech' JT Toppin, Saunders is one of just two Big 12 players to score more than 1,000 points over the last two campaigns. He averaged a career-best 18.0 points per game across 25 starts this season and was a two-way standout who also tallied 1.7 steals per contest.While BYU still boasts its top two scorers -- AJ Dybantsa leads the nation with 24.4 points per game and Rob Wright III averages 18.7 -- Saunders' absence for the rest of the season could prove devastating to the Cougars' chances of making a deep NCAA Tournament run. They had already fallen out of favor as a Final Four contender after losing four consecutive games against ranked opponents.\"It sucked the life out of the gym, if I'm being honest,\" Young said postgame. \"You never want to see an injury to any player, but definitely to someone who's the heart and soul of our team, bleeds BYU blue. Just didn't like seeing it. Unfortunately, you've gotta move on. You've gotta find a way to come in and channel that emotion.\"\nThe Saunders-less Cougars will have to adjust on the fly against two elite opponents in their next two games. Their first game without the senior guard comes Wednesday at No. 1 Arizona, and they square off against No. 5 Iowa State on Saturday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LeBron James is an All Star for a record-extending 22nd consecutive season. Whether or not it's his final one remains TBD. Speaking ahead of Sunday night's All-Star Game, the Los Angeles Lakers superstar remained mum on his basketball-playing future.\"When I know, you guys will know,\" James said about how he's feeling about playing next season. \"I don't know. I have no idea.\"James, 41, is in the final year of a two-year, $104 million deal, the fourth deal he has signed with the Lakers. He's averaging 22.0 points, 7.1 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game this season, with the scoring average on pace to be his lowest since his rookie season (2003-04) when he was still a teenager.James has already missed 18 games this season due to a variety of ailments, meaning he will not be eligible for All-NBA team selection -- there's a 65-game minimum -- which means his 21-year All-NBA streak will end. Still, he has shown moments of dominance, including a triple-double in the Lakers' 124-104 win over the Dallas Mavericks to send the team into the All-Star break.\nIt ended an eventful pre-break stretch for James, who also missed a game with left foot arthritis and, before that, shared a blunt assessment of his team.\"You want me to compare us to them? That's a championship team right there. We're not,\" James told reporters after Monday night's loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. \"We can't sustain energy and effort for 48 minutes, and they can. That's why they won a championship.\"The Lakers (33-21) are fifth in the Western Conference. On one hand, they have a point differential that suggests they should be closer to .500. On the other hand, they've rarely been fully healthy. Luka Dončić has missed 12 games, Austin Reaves has missed 26, and Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart have both missed 10. James acknowledged the health factor Sunday.\n\"It's too hard to really say what we're capable of,\" James said about the team's prospects following the All-Star break. \"I know that we've played some of our best basketball this season, we've looked very good. On the other side, we've been terrible. We've looked disgusting. I think the most important [thing] is if we can get healthy, how many minutes we can be on the floor, how much chemistry with can build with this sprint starting.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe business end of the UEFA Champions League season officially begins this week with first leg ties in the knockout phase playoffs, with Real Madrid and reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain headlining the list of 16 teams competing for eight spots tickets to the round of 16.For Los Blancos, the knockout phase playoffs offer a chance to immediately seek revenge after a surprise 4-2 defeat to Benfica on Matchday 8, one that knocked them out of a top eight finish they looked nearly certain to clinch. It marked an unusual but noticeable hiccup for Madrid since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge following Xabi Alonso's January firing, one that linger in the back of everyone's minds even as they assume their regular position as the favorites in this tie thanks in large part to Kylian Mbappe's scintillating form.Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain make a familiar trek to Monaco as their title defense continues. The reigning champions are naturally the oddsmakers' choice to advance despite a mixed bag in the league phase – four wins out of eight demonstrate that the luster of last season's run to silverware remains but losses to Bayern Munich and Sporting Lisbon, alongside draws against Athletic Club and Newcastle United, prove they are not infallible.Previous Champions League winners Inter will also pass through the knockout phase playoffs in the hopes of advancing, while former finalists Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund are amongst a group that await meetings with the league phase's top eight teams, including Arsenal and Bayern.Here's what you need to know before tuning in.How to watchParamount+ will have every minute of Champions League action this week, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will provide select coverage. Tuesday's slate begins on CBS Sports Golazo Network with Champions League Matchday and the broadcast of Juventus' trip to Galatasaray, while CBS Sports Network will have the UEFA Champions League Today pre-match show before airing Borussia Dortmund's clash with Atalanta. (Those matches will also be simulcast on Paramount+.) The Golazo Show on Paramount+, as usual, will return for the late slate of matches on both days. After the UEFA Champions League Today post-match show on Paramount+ (and on CBS Sports Network on Tuesday), each day's coverage concludes with new editions of The Champions Club and Scoreline on CBS Sports Golazo Network.

It was the England international's first start since December and only his 17th appearance of the season during an injury-plagued first campaign with Madrid, but Alexander-Arnold's return comes with a major boost for Arbeloa and company. Mbappe has been the most consistent attacker in Europe this season with 39 goals across all competitions but Alexander-Arnold offers more range and dynamism for Los Blancos' offense at a very crucial juncture of the season. He's a uniquely creative right back, the best in the world at what he does with an ability to distribute from just about every position on the right flank. His assist on Saturday is merely a precursor for what he can offer Madrid and though he does not solve all of the team's problems (of which there are many), he automatically makes them more of an attacking presence – and harder to beat.Weston McKennie's big season: Juventus are still in the thick of the top four race in Serie A but have a chance to make their deepest Champions League run in four years with a tie against Galatasaray, thanks in large part to Weston McKennie's recent form. The U.S. international is already in the midst of his best goalscoring season ever with seven across all competitions, his performances allowing him to be what Juventus need at exactly the right time. McKennie, who also has four assists this season, has been a utility player for many of his six years with the Turn-based club but has become an out-and-out attacking force since Luciano Spalletti took over as the team's coach last fall. It is a tactical shift that suits McKennie really well and has allowed him to hit another level with a World Cup on home soil just months away, the 27-year-old peaking at just the right time. For a team that's in the middle of the pack in terms of their goalscoring form – Juventus scored 14 in eight league phase matches – McKennie's uptick in form may just be well-timed for them, too, especially against a goal-shy Galatasaray.First-timers target upsets: For Azerbaijan's Qarabag and Norway's Bodo/Glimt, their history-making European campaigns were not reserved solely for the league phase. The pair have reached the knockouts for the first time, Glimt doing so in their first-ever Champions League campaign and less than a year removed from their historic run to the UEFA Europa League semifinals. Naturally, though, things will not get easier from here. Qarabag host Newcastle United, who will travel more than 2,500 miles to Baku for the first leg, the visitors down on their luck in domestic play but still full of quality. Glimt, meanwhile, have quite the uphill battle against Serie A leaders Inter, who continue to seek redemption after their potential treble-winning season unraveled completely a year ago. Big results over the course of the league phase, though, including Qarabag's 2-2 draw with Chelsea and Glimt's 3-1 win over Manchester City, should provide enough confidence for the ambitious underdogs to draw upon as the knockouts approach.\n            ",

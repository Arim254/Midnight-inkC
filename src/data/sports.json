    "body": "\n        Thursday Night Football features the Denver Broncos hosting the Las Vegas Raiders, providing sports bettors a great opportunity to use the latest DraftKings promo code, which offers new users $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass. The Broncos have struggled mightily against the Raiders, losing eight of their last 10 meetings with Las Vegas. However, SportsLine's advanced computer model isn't expecting that trend to continue on Thursday night, projecting the Broncos to win handily and making Denver -9.5 one of its Thursday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook.SportsLine's advanced computer model has also identified value in college football and NBA games. The model likes the Suns to cover as 2.5-point favorites and projects UTSA to keep pace with South Florida and cover as 13.5-point underdogs. The Suns play the Clippers, who are without James Harden (personal) and Kawhi Leonard (ankle). Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. The model enters Week 3 of the 2025-26 NBA season on a sizzling 26-13 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. It also enters Week 10 on a sizzling 47-29 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024 for the NFL. Anyone following its college football betting picks, NBA betting advice or NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Thursday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookUTSA (+13.5) vs. South Florida (-108)Broncos (-9.5) vs. Raiders (-110)Suns (-2.5) vs. Clippers (-112)Combining the model's three picks into a Thursday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +595 (risk $100 to win $596). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nUTSA (+13.5) vs. South Florida (-108)Owen McCown is the son of an NFL quarterback, but he was playing like a professional the last time he was on the field. The junior was near flawless, completing 31 of 33 passes (93.9%) for 370 yards and four touchdowns in a 48-26 win over Tulane when playing on Thursday last week. McCown, the son of former NFL cornerback Josh McCown, has 10 touchdowns compared to two interceptions over his last four games, and he's averaging 210 passing yards per game on the season. Outside of its opening matchup against Texas A&M, which is currently ranked No. 3 in the nation, UTSA has covered a 13.5-point spread in six of seven games this season. South Florida is a quality team at 6-2 overall and 3-1 in the conference, but the model views this as too many points for a capable offense led by McCown. The model projects UTSA to cover in 63% of simulations. Back UTSA at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Broncos (-9.5) vs. Raiders (-110)Pete Carroll's return to an NFL sideline has been a tough one the majority of the season, as the Raiders are 2-6 in his first year as Las Vegas head coach, with four of those losses coming by double digits. The Raiders' last four results include a 31-0 loss to the Chiefs and a 40-6 loss to the Colts, and with the Broncos having a 7-2 record entering Thursday Night Football, they are approaching that elite AFC status of teams like the Chiefs and Colts. The Raiders are 29th in scoring (16.5 ppg) and 30th in total yards (283.3 per game), and they traded arguably their most talented wide receiver in Jacobi Meyers at the trade deadline. The Broncos have won six straight gam=ames, and the model expects that to continue convincingly, projecting Denver to cover the spread in 62% of simulations. Back the Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Suns (-2.5) vs. Clippers (-115)The Clippers will be without their two superstars on Thursday with James Harden (personal) and Kawhi Leonard (ankle) both out. Having one of them out is a significant loss for Los Angeles, but both being out is a situation the model doesn't project the Clippers will overcome. Devin Booker is averaging 31 points and seven assists as the clear alpha for the Suns this season, and he's coming off scoring 38 points against the Warriors on Tuesday. The Suns are home on Thursday, and they are 3-1 at home this season, with their only loss in Phoenix coming in a 114-113 final against the Grizzlies. The model projects the Sun to cover in 56% of simulations. Back the Suns at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Thursday NFL, NBA and college football picks?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Former NBA player and coach Damon Jones pleaded not guilty on two charges stemming from his alleged involvement in an illegal gambling scandal, per CBS News. Jones was then released on a $200,000 bond, and he is prohibited from gambling or making contact with organized crime as part of the bond terms.Jones is facing charges in two cases. One of them involves an allegation that he provided insider information to a co-conspirator, who then used that data to bet on NBA games. The second case involves Jones allegedly luring other athletes into rigged poker games organized by the mafia with Jones accused of taking a cut of the money as compensation for his role.In the first case, Jones allegedly sent a text to a co-conspirator on Feb. 9, 2023, in which he says, \"Get a big bet on Milwaukee before the information is out! [Player 3] is out tonight.\" As it happened, LeBron James missed the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Bucks that night.The other indictment accuses Jones, along with Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups, of serving as a \"face card\" for rigged poker games set up by the mafia. Former players like Jones and Billups would lure in players, and the venue would feature X-ray tables, rigged shuffling machines, and glasses designed to see marked cards.\nMiami Heat player Terry Rozier was also caught up in this scandal, and he is accused of passing along insider information to help co-conspirators bet on NBA games. At this time, neither Billups nor Rozier have entered a plea. They are set to appear in court on Nov. 24.Billups, the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers, has been suspended while the legal process plays out. Tiago Splitter is serving as the interim in his place.Rozier has also been suspended without pay, but the NBPA is challenging it. In a statement to ESPN, the NBPA said a suspension without pay is \"counter to the presumption of innocence and inconsistent with the terms of our collective bargaining agreement.\"\nOne day before Jones entered his not guilty pleas, NBA officials met with congressional staffers to discuss the gambling scandals and the league's ties with sportsbooks, per the Associated Press.\n            ",

He was 71.Lowe was a College Football Hall of Fame player who starred for the Crimson Tide from 1972-75. The linebacker was one of the greatest players to excel under the tutelage of coach Bear Bryant, and he hauled in numerous accolades throughout an illustrious career. Lowe was a three-time first-team All-American and received a consensus nod in 1974. He remains one of two Alabama players to haul in first-team All-American selections in three different years.Lowe contributed to four nationally prominent Alabama teams, including the 1973 squad that won a national championship. Not once in his career did the Crimson Tide win fewer than 10 games, and each year Lowe's squads ranked in the top two of the AP Top 25. Alabama also won the SEC championship in each of his four seasons in the program.A full 50 years removed from his final snap in Tuscaloosa, Lowe's legacy is still very much present in the Alabama record books. He stands as the Crimson Tide's leader in single-season tackles with the 134 stops he recorded in 1973, and he ranks fourth in program history in career tackles with 315.It took no time at all for Lowe, a Phenix City, Alabama, native, to make an impact with the Crimson Tide. He earned a starting role in his first year on campus, taking advantage of the NCAA's new rule permitting freshmen to play varsity college football. Lowe was off to the races from there and shined over the ensuing three seasons, earning national honors every year until his departure for the NFL. His 315 career tackles were, at the time, a school record.The San Diego Chargers selected Lowe with the No. 131 overall pick in the 1976 NFL Draft. The fifth-round selection played 164 games at the pro level, earned a Pro Bowl nod in 1981 and was a team captain. The Chargers later named him to their 40th and 50th anniversary teams.Lowe embarked on a coaching career at the end of his time with the Chargers. He served on multiple NFL staffs, making stops with the Los Angeles Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs, and eventually returned to his hometown to become a high school assistant at his alma mater, Central. He then held head coaching positions over nine years at Selma, Smiths Station and Central.\n            \n    ",

He ended up re-entering the game but was clearly compromised.Smith was attempting to run the ball when Denver standout linebacker Nik Bonitto tripped him up to limit him to a 1-yard game. Broncos defensive lineman Malcolm Roach then landed on Smith, who initially got up but then went back down. Smith walked off the field gingerly but returned after missing just two offensive plays.\"He wanted to go back in in the worst way,\" Carroll said. \"He wanted to finish the game for his teammates. He got whacked in the quad, got a quad bruise or something, contusion, whatever it is. He got smacked. That's just him fighting.\"Smith said he was \"in a lot of pain\" but tried to block it out.\"That's just kind of how I'm wired,\" Smith said. \"I never want to leave my teammates out there alone. I feel like it's a big responsibility of mine to be out there and to do whatever I can to help us win. I felt like I could try to tough it out, and that's what I tried to do.\nKenny Pickett played the two snaps Smith missed.In the final minutes of the game, Smith was listed as questionable -- though the Raiders' offense never got back on the field after that ruling came in -- and had a heating pad on his left quad. Carroll said Smith would not have re-entered the game if the Raiders had been able to get the ball back.It's been a difficult year for Smith, 35, who arrived in Las Vegas this offseason via trade and reunited with Carroll, his former Seahawks coach. Smith has thrown 12 interceptions, most in the NFL, and just 11 touchdowns, and the Raiders are 2-7.Smith finished 16 for 26 for 143 yards, one interception and six sacks taken.\nThe Raiders get a mini bye plus an extra day of rest; their Week 11 game is \"Monday Night Football\" against the Cowboys.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane will likely run it back after a disastrous end to UFC 321. UFC CEO Dana White plans to rebook the match as soon as possible and provided a promising health update for Aspinall.The mixed martial arts world was vexed on Oct. 25 after a premature conclusion to UFC 321's main event. Gane looked sharp early against the UFC heavyweight champion, but an accidental double eyepoke left Aspinall unable to continue before Round 1 concluded. The fight was officially ruled a no-contest. \"I was devastated,\" White told \"The Jim Rome Show.\" \"When your main event is heating up and looks like  it'll be a really good fight, and it ends with an eye poke, that's  brutal. He's at home recovering. As soon as he's able to fight again,  we'll book the rematch.\"If there's a silver lining, it's that Gane is a more believable challenger the second time. His early success against Aspinall turned heads, and with no other standout contenders in the heavyweight division, there's arguably more intrigue than ever for their fight.\nWhite wouldn't commit to a timeline for the fight, but he gave a promising update on Aspinall's condition. According to White, Aspinall did not suffer a detached retina or any serious long-term eye damage.\"As far as we know, he doesn't have a detached retina, there's no damage  to the eye,\" White said. \"He should he'll up soon and we'll figure out when we can  make the fight again.\"Whatever the outcome of their rematch, the same problem persists at heavyweight. There are very few compelling challengers. It's particularly true if Aspinall wins, having beaten four of the current top five. The exception to that is Jailton Almeida (No. 5), who is coming off a lifeless loss to Alexander Volkov, where Almeida seemed lost.\nVolkov has the best case on paper. He's 5-1 in his last six, with the only blemish being a controversial split decision loss to Gane. Then there's Waldo Cortes-Acosta (No. 6), who ironically knocked out Aspinall's training partner Ante Delija last week after Delija poked him in the eye. The most high-profile option is former heavyweight and light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, but it's unlikely anyone will make the effort to secure it.When Jones was the heavyweight champion, he repeatedly denounced interim champion Aspinall, denying Aspinall his unification fight. Ultimately, Jones retired in June, vacating the title, only to unretire shortly after Aspinall graduated to undisputed champion. On Thursday, Jones confessed to renegging on a verbal agreement to fight Aspinall.\n\"I'm giving Dana his space. We had a verbal agreement that didn't go over well,\" Jones told the \"No Scripts.\". \"Nothing was finalized.  The way things went down, I was wrong. I wish that I could see him face-to-face and apologize to him.\"  Jones retired with the desire to fight light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira on the White House card. Both fighters are publicly campaigning for a non-title heavyweight fight, so it's unlikely Jones would agree to fight Aspinall. White has publicly stated there's a \"billion to one\" chance Jones competes at the White House after imploding the Aspinall negotiations. \nAspinall wants nothing to do with Jones after having two years of his prime mostly stalled by Jones' unwillingness to fight him.\n            ",

Hall went down in the first quarter of Saturday's SEC showdown, and was eventually ruled out.Hall has started in each of Georgia's first eight games, and recorded 12 tackles and two tackles for loss. The Jacksonville native was a five-star recruit who came to Athens as a member of the No. 2-ranked 2023 class. In 24 collegiate games played, he's recorded 26 tackles.Georgia's defense is allowing 309.4 total yards per game, which ranks No. 21 in the FBS and No. 2 in the SEC. This unit held the Gators to 2 of 11 on third downs without Hall, and just 281 yards of total offense.\nUp next for the Bulldogs is Mississippi State in Starkville on Saturday, with a historic streak on the line. Georgia has won 46 straight games vs. unranked teams, which is the longest active streak in the FBS. With a win this week, the Bulldogs will tie the second-longest win streak vs. unranked teams in the FBS over the last 30 years. Georgia has won five straight, and 14 out of the last 15 vs. Mississippi State. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 10 NFL schedule kicks with the Denver Broncos vs. the Las Vegas Raiders in an AFC West showdown on 'Thursday Night Football.' The games starts at 8:15 p.m. ET, and daily Fantasy football players will have to be creative when looking for production since this game only has an over/under of 42.5, the fourth lowest of the week. Denver has an elite defense, while Las Vegas has struggled offensively, so can you trust Las Vegas players like Geno Smith, Brock Bowers or Ashton Jeanty as NFL DFS picks?On the Denver side, Bo Nix, Courtland Sutton and JK Dobbins will all be popular for NFL DFS lineups. Meanwhile, with Vegas just trading away Jakobi Meyers, could Raheem Mostert be more of a factor out of the backfield in the passing game? Before locking in any NFL DFS picks on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him is way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to 'Thursday Night Football' and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football'Part of McClure's NFL DFS strategy is rostering Las Vegas tight end Brock Bowers. The second-year pro was dominant as a rookie, but has been limited by injuries in 2025. He got back on the field in Week 9, however, and put up a massive 12-127-3 receiving line against the Jaguars. Denver's defense is elite, but the Broncos have given opposing tight ends a little space as they ranked outside the top 10 in Fantasy points given up against the position, so Bowers is one Las Vegas player who could do some damage on Thursday. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, who has an over/under of 71.5 rushing yards. Dobbins hasn't been much of a touchdown threat, but he's been a high-floor option in recent weeks due to his total workload. He's averaging more than 14 carries per game over the past three weeks, and he's averaged an efficient 5.2 yards per carry during that span. With Denver favored by more than a touchdown, there's a good chance that the game flow will allow him to see plenty of carries. Additionally, the Raiders allowed Travis Etienne of Jacksonville to go for 115 scrimmage yards last week. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Raiders vs. BroncosMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.' This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.So who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for Thursday, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

The Pacers will sign veteran guard Monte Morris to fill the roster spot.McClung inked a multiyear deal with the Pacers on Oct. 28, marking the first standard NBA contract of his career. He spent the majority of his professional career on short-term and two-way deals and bounced between the G League and NBA with multiple franchises including the Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago Bulls, Philadelphia 76ers and Orlando Magic.The three games McClung spent with the Pacers were his most with one NBA team in a single season. He averaged 6.3 points across the three contests on 38.9% shooting with the vast majority of his production coming in the first two outings; he played just two minutes in the final game.\nWhile his NBA opportunities are limited, McClung made a reputation as a supreme athlete with elite dunking ability. He won the league's dunk contest at each of the last three All-Star weekends. McClung also boasts a track record as a G League standout and won the MVP award at the end of a stellar year with the Osceola Magic.McClung recorded perfect 50 scores on all but one dunk in the 2023 contest, in which he participated on a two-way contract with the 76ers. He repeated as champion the following year and made it three-straight titles in 2025, becoming the first player in NBA history to do so. His three dunk crowns match those of Nate Robinson -- the only other player to ever win the contest three times.\nWhen the Pacers signed McClung, they waived former No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman to make room on the roster. Morris is now the second player to fill Wiseman's old roster spot and will offer guard depth to a squad that thus far has been a revolving door in the backcourt. The Pacers will move forward without McClung as they seek to dig themselves out of a 1-7 hole. They stand with the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, tied for the worst record in the NBA.\n            \n    ",

McIntosh and the rest of the athletic department will continue evaluating the program while committing to an increased level of investment. \"Chancellor [Jennifer] Mnookin and I are aligned on significantly elevating investment in our program to compete at highest level,\" McIntosh told ESPN. \"We are willing to make an investment in infrastructure and staff. As important, is our ability to retain and recruit players in a revenue share and NIL era.\"Fickell is 14-19 in three full seasons as Wisconsin's coach. He has not produced a winning record since 2023 and his Badgers have not won a Big Ten game since Oct. 19, 2024. They currently sit at 2-6 eight games into the 2025 campaign, including a 0-5 mark in conference play. Wisconsin's six losses have come by an average of 23.3 points per game. The Badgers have yet to score more than 14 points against a Power Four opponent and they have held just one power-conference team below 24 points this season. \nThis will likely mark a second-straight year without a bowl game for the Badgers, who had 22 consecutive postseason appearances from 2002-23. Wisconsin's losing record in 2024 also snapped its streak of 22-straight seasons finishing above .500. \"This season has caused us all to have to look from within,\" McIntosh said. \"Luke has had to do that. I've had to do that. He has a willingness to be better. So do I, and so does Wisconsin from an institutional perspective.\"Wisconsin's decision to retain Fickell is likely informed by -- in part, at least -- what has been a busy coaching carousel thus far. Were the Badgers to make a change, they would have to contend with a litany of powerhouse programs like Penn State, LSU, Florida and Auburn during the hiring process. \nFickell also touts a buyout that will sit around $25 million at season's end. \n            \n    ",

Meanwhile, the Raiders (2-6) suffered a defeat out of their bye on Sunday as they lost in overtime to Jacksonville, 30-29. The Raiders lead the all-time series, 73-56-2. Denver cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) and receiver Marvin Mims (concussion) have been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Empower Field at Mile High in Denver.

Meanwhile, Denver hasn't lived up to being a heavy favorite this season, going just 1-3 against the spread when favored by at least a touchdown. The Broncos have also gone just 1-4 straight up over their last five Thursday games as short turnarounds haven't worked in their favor.Vegas does have several standouts who can make this game competitive, starting with Geno Smith, who is coming off a four-passing touchdown on Sunday. Three of those were caught by Brock Bowers, who had missed the three previous games. Rookie Ashton Jeanty is averaging 94.6 scrimmage yards over his last five games, with five total touchdowns over that stretch.

    "body": "\n        The final month of the regular season is always filled with posturing from teams and conferences vying for College Football Playoff spots, and coaches already began standing up for their leagues in the hunt for postseason berths. Prior to the debut CFP Top 25 rankings reveal, it was Texas' Steve Sarkisian championing three-loss SEC teams as playoff candidates. And after the rankings were unveiled, Nebraska's Matt Rhule spoke in defense of the Big Ten.Rhule specifically pointed to the quartet of two-loss teams in his conference and vouched for them in their respective quests for CFP bids. If one of the squads in that bunch – No. 19 USC, No. 20 Iowa, No. 21 Michigan and No. 23 Washington -- got into the bracket, the Big Ten could have four teams represented in the race for the national championship.\"I think the Big Ten teams with two losses are underappreciated,\" Rhule said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"I think Iowa's having a heck of a season. I think SC is having a heck of a season, and many more. Michigan is at 7-2. … I do think there are some really good teams in the Big Ten. We deserve four in.\"The CFP selection committee views each of the Big Ten's two-loss teams similarly and effectively grouped them into a tier in its first batch of rankings. The committee respects those squads as playoff contenders but, for the moment, has them on the outside looking in at the 12-team bracket. It also placed them behind two-loss teams from all of the other power conferences, sending a clear message that their résumés are weaker than some of their SEC, ACC and Big 12 counterparts'.Those modest rankings for the Trojans, Hawkeyes, Wolverines and Huskies make their paths to the playoff fairly clear; they will likely need to win out and finish the regular season at 10-2 in order to clinch a berth.\n\n    \n                                        \n    USC TrojansUSC and Iowa will sort themselves out because they go head-to-head on Nov. 15 in what will be a de facto playoff elimination game. From there, the road gets even trickier for the Trojans as they must also get past No. 9 Oregon and do so in Autzen Stadium. With victories over the Hawkeyes and Ducks, USC would likely be one of the most accomplished two-loss teams in the country. Of course, Lincoln Riley's crew must first take care of business Friday against Northwestern and finish things off on Nov. 29 with a rivalry win over UCLA.\n    \n                                        \n    Iowa HawkeyesThe rubber meets the road this week for Iowa, which hosts Oregon at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS. Kinnick Stadium already proved daunting for one playoff hopeful in No. 2 Indiana, which played its worst game of the year in a narrow 20-15 win over the Hawkeyes in September. If the Hawkeyes spring a trap for the Ducks, the only things standing between them and their first trip to the CFP would be tricky road games at USC and Nebraska and a home date with Michigan State. A splashy win over the Ducks may also give them margin for error down the line as a potential three-loss playoff hopeful.\n    \n                                        \n    Michigan WolverinesWith all due respect to Northwestern and Maryland, whom the Wolverines face in their next two outings, there is only one real résumé-building opportunity remaining on Michigan's schedule: the regular-season finale against No. 1 Ohio State. The Wolverines will be betting underdogs when their bitter rivals visit Ann Arbor, but if the last four years taught the college football world anything, it is to throw expectations out the window for The Game. Sherrone Moore seemingly has Ohio State's number, and this year he duels with Ryan Day's Buckeyes at home. A fifth-straight win in the series would be the cherry on top of a 10-2 season, which almost certainly gets Michigan into the field.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Washington HuskiesWashington might be the sneakiest CFP contender nobody is talking about. The Huskies' 3-2 conference record has them sitting in the middle of the pack on the Big Ten leaderboard, but in a few weeks' time, they could be much closer to the top. They project as comfortable favorites over Wisconsin, Purdue and UCLA, and if they scorch through that stretch, they will set up a monumental rivalry battle with Oregon on their home turf. It would be a de facto play-in game for Jedd Fisch, who could then become the third different coach to take Washington to the playoff.\n            ",

The Broncos are coming off yet another fourth-quarter comeback against the Houston Texans, a game in which they won, 18-15. The Raiders on the other hand fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars in overtime, 30-29.While the Broncos are currently sitting atop their division, their lead over the Los Angeles Chargers (6-3) and Kansas City Chiefs (5-4) is one and two games, respectively. Additionally, Denver still has to have both meetings with Kansas City and it hosts Los Angeles in the regular season finale so there's no opportunity for the Broncos to take their foot off the gas.Click here to bet Raiders vs. Broncos at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Despite the Raiders' loss on Sunday, Smith turned in one of his best performances of the year, as he threw for 284 yards, a season-high four touchdowns against only one interception. He clearly missed tight end Brock Bowers, as the young star caught 12 passes for 127 yards and three touchdowns in his return to the lineup after missing the last three games due to a knee injury. As for the Broncos, their second-year signal-caller Nix passed John Elway for the most wins (17) in a quarterback's first two seasons in Broncos history. He registered the seventh game-winning drive of his career this past week, and his fourth this season. The 7-2 start is Denver's best since 2015, when Peyton Manning led the Broncos to a Super Bowl victory. What will happen this year?Where to watch Raiders vs. Broncos liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 6 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Empower Field at Mile High -- Denver, ColoradoStream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -9.5; O/U 42.5 (via FanDuel)Raiders vs. Broncos: Need to knowThe Broncos are streaking. The Broncos have now won six straight games, which is tied for the longest active streak in the NFL with the New England Patriots. Denver has also won nine straight home games, which marks the longest active streak in the league. Denver is dominating on defense and in the trenches. The Broncos defense leads the NFL in sacks per game (4.4), third-down percentage (28.2%) and red zone touchdown percentage (34.8%). Denver has recorded the most sacks (40) and is tied in allowing the fewest sacks (9) this season. Las Vegas is down a receiver. Vegas won't have wide receiver Jakobi Meyers in the lineup moving forward, as just before Tuesday's trade deadline the Raiders dealt him to the Jaguars for fourth- and sixth-round picks. The 28-year-old wideout caught 33 passes for 352 yards in seven games played this season. More pressure will be placed on leading receiver Tre Tucker, as well as rookies Dont'e Thornton Jr. and Jack Bech. History suggests Raiders are not-ready-for-prime-time players. The Raiders have lost seven straight road games in prime time, with their last win coming in 2017 against the Miami Dolphins on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Vegas has also scored fewer than 10 points in back-to-back prime-time games, and been out-scored 71-6 over the last two road games.Fourth-quarter kings: There's no denying that the Broncos offense has been Jekyll and Hyde for most of the season. It can look like one of the most anemic units in the league one moment, then drop 33 points in a quarter the next. The Broncos have four game-winning drives this season, which is tied for most in the NFL with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and own the league's best fourth-quarter point differential (+66) during this current six-game win streak. No team should feel safe with a lead in the fourth quarter against Denver -- no matter how many points it is. Raiders vs. Broncos prediction, pick\nThe Broncos have made a habit of playing close games against inferior opponents. They struggled with the Tennessee Titans in the season opener, defeated the lowly New York Jets by just two points and needed a historic comeback to beat the New York Giants. It wouldn't surprise me to see this game come down to the fourth quarter, but I'll take Denver to cover the spread as long as the number is under 10. Smith is 0-5 against the spread in prime time since the start of last season, while Nix is 3-1 straight up and against the spread in his career in prime time. Pick: Broncos -9.5, Over 42.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

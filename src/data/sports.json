Only one of the Eagles' eight wins has been by more than 7, so all we're asking here is for Ben Johnson to do as good a job as most teams have against Philly this year to keep this a one-score game.\"Over 44.5 pointsBen Johnson has proven he was ready for the big chair as an NFL head coach, as the former standout Lions offensive coordinator is leading another elite offensive unit in the NFC North. The Bears are eighth in the league in scoring offense at 26.3 points per game. The defense has struggled, though, ranking 27th at 26.5 ppg allowed this year. The Eagles' offense is one of the most perplexing aspects about the 2025 NFL season, as the unit is filled with star power such as Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, yet it ranks in the middle of the league in scoring at 23.2 ppg, which is 17th. The Bears' defense could be what the Eagles need to break out, though. The model projects the Over to hit in 55% of simulations.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

It has Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving. Kansas City (6-5) toppled Indianapolis, 23-20, in Week 12 and will be part of the NFL Thanksgiving tradition for the first time since 2006, going 5-5 all-time on Turkey Day. RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) will return for Kansas City, while Cowboys OL Tyler Guyton (ankle) is out.Kickoff is from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone. As for Mahomes, the native Texan should relish his first pro game in Dallas as he gets to face the Cowboys' No. 30 pass defense as the Chiefs look to improve to 4-1 ATS versus NFC opponents this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Cowboys can coverIt's been over 50 years since the Chiefs won in Dallas, as the Cowboys have prevailed in their last five home games versus Kansas City. Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

    "body": "\n        No. 2 South Carolina and No. 4 Texas are facing off in the inaugural women's basketball Players Era championship game on Thursday. The game is a rematch from the 2025 Final Four. Later on Thanksgiving, No. 3 UCLA and Duke will battle it out in the third-place game.Texas earned its spot with a 76-65 win against UCLA on Wednesday. The Longhorns were missing Aaliyah Crump and Bryanna Preston due to injury, but they still got their biggest win of the season so far. Their defense was visibly disrupting for the Bruins, who ended the night with 20 turnovers. Rori Harmon led Texas' offense with 26 points, and her overall performance led coach Vic Schaefer to say this game showed why she is \"the best point guard in the country.\"\nSouth Carolina picked up a 83-66 win against Duke, a team that is currently out of the AP Top 25 but was ranked in the top 10 during preseason. The Blue Devils kept it close early in the game, but South Carolina got the job done with Joyce Edwards and Madina Okot scoring a combined 45 points. Okot also completed a double-double with 13 rebounds. Just like in the men's tournament, which expanded to 18 teams this year, each participating is set to receive $1 million in NIL money. The players get all the money, which means each of them will receive around $75,000. Other than the money, the elite lineup is a great opportunity for the teams to test themselves against top competition early in the season. Founders of the event also believe this is an opportunity to get a brighter spotlight on college basketball during the fall.\n\"College basketball has always started in November. But let's give it more,\" Players Era co-founder Seth Berger told CBS Sports. \"Let's give everyone a reason to watch, not just the most hardcore of the fans. So first and foremost, I thought there was an opportunity to create a great American sporting event, a tentpole event in November.\" Women's Player Era schedule, scoresAll times are Eastern\nWednesday, Nov. 26No. 4 Texas 76, No. 3 UCLA 65No. 2 South Carolina 83, Duke 66Thursday, Nov. 27No. 2 South Carolina vs. No. 4 Texas (Championship game) | 8 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxDuke vs. No. 3 UCLA (Third-place game) | 10:30 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxTexas vs. South Carolina predictionThese are two teams that pride themselves on defense, so I think this game will come down to who can find, and keep, momentum on offense. While both programs worked on getting stronger in this area during the summer and added valuable weapons, Texas probably had the most dramatic improvement since their Final Four meeting (a 17-point South Carolina win). The Longhorns made six 3-pointers against UCLA, which is not a particularly high number, but they did it without Aaliyah Crump and this was also not at all their forte last season. I like the overall potential we are seeing from Texas, especially with how quickly they adjusted with injuries ahead of this tournament. Although this is not an easy decision because South Carolina is always a dangerous opponent, the Longhorns already made a statement in Las Vegas with how they handled a very good UCLA team. Pick: Texas\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Outside of Super Bowl Sunday, Thanksgiving is arguably the day most synonymous with football, and the NFL made sure to schedule three mouthwatering matchups. The Thanksgiving NFL schedule begins with the Detroit Lions (7-4) hosing the Green Bay Packers (7-3-1) in an NFC North battle at 1 p.m. ET, followed by the Dallas Cowboys (5-5-1) hosting the Kansas City Chiefs (6-5) at 4:30 p.m. on CBS and Paramount+, before the Baltmore Ravens (6-5) host the Cincinnati Bengals (3-8) at 8:20 p.m. ET. All three games are sure to garner ample online sports betting interest. The highest over/under on Thanksgiving is 52.5 points in Chiefs vs. Cowboys. There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL on Thanksgiving.

The Lions have lost seven of their last eight Thanksgiving games; however, Detroit did defeat Chicago, 23-20, on Thanksgiving last season. The Lions are coming off a 34-27 overtime victory over the Giants to improve to 7-4 overall and 4-1 at home this season. Jahmyr Gibbs rushed for 219 yards and two touchdowns and added 11 receptions for 45 yards and a score last week, as a nearly unstoppable weapon out of the backfield. He's averaging 113 rushing yards at home this season, and the model projects Gibbs to be a significant reason the Lions win and cover on Thanksgiving. The model projects the Lions to cover the spread in 52% of simulations.Chiefs vs. Cowboys betting preview, picksChiefs (-3) vs. CowboysThe Chiefs missing the playoffs flashed before the eyes of nearly everyone in America when seeing Kansas City trailing by 11 points in the fourth quarter last week and on the verge of falling to below .500 after 12 weeks. But rather unsurprisingly, given how dominant the Chiefs have been in recent seasons, Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid didn't allow that to become a reality, completing the comeback and forcing overtime in an eventual 23-20 win over the Colts, who entered last week as one of only three teams in the AFC with two losses. Every game remains crucial to the Chiefs, who at 6-5 are far from certain to make the postseason, and they'll take on the 5-5-1 Cowboys. Dallas' defense has performed better since its trade deadline acquisitions, but overall, the Cowboys still rank 31st in scoring defense at 28.5 ppg allowed this season. With a national audience in what is likely to be the most-viewed regular-season game of the NFL season, the model expects the Chiefs to put on a show, projecting Kansas City to cover the spread in 54% of simulations.Bengals vs. Ravens betting preview, picksRavens (-7) vs. BengalsEven if Joe Burrow (toe) can take the field for the first time since Week 2, the main reason for the Bengals' 3-8 record this season remains unaffected. Cincinnati has the worst scoring defense in the NFL, allowing 32.7 ppg on an NFL-worst 415.8 yards per contest. The Bengals are 18th in scoring this season at 22.5 ppg, which is just below the NFL average. The Bengals averaged 27.2 ppg in Joe Flacco's six starts, which would rank seventh over the course of the whole season, and they still went 1-5 due to the abysmal Cincinnati defense. With a matchup against Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Zay Flowers ahead, the model does not project this to go well for the Bengals' defense, and it will be difficult for whoever Cincinnati's QB1 is to keep pace with what the 'D' allows. The model projects the Ravens to cover in 54% of simulations. Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

On his third carry of the night, Henry passed NFL legend Jim Brown on the all-time career rushing list. Henry entered the game with 12,294 yards across 10 NFL seasons. Brown, who retired after the 1965 season as the NFL's all-time rushing leader, ran for 12,312 yards during his nine-year Hall of Fame career. Henry passed Brown on a 28-yard touchdown run that capped off Baltimore's first drive. \nEarlier this season, Henry became only the 17th player of the 12,000-yard club, which is especially notable as every eligible member of that club is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also recently passed Hall of Famer Walter Payton for fifth all time in career touchdown runs. \nNFL all-time career rushing list PlayerYards1. Emmitt Smith**18,3552. Walter Payton**16,7263.

Steven Jackson11,43820. John Riggins**11,352** -- Pro Football Hall of Fame members Henry passing Brown is notable history indeed. Brown, who in 1964 led the Browns to their most recent NFL title, was the league's career rushing leader at the time of his retirement despite playing only nine seasons. In those nine seasons, he won a whopping eight rushing titles in addition to being an eight-time All-Pro and three-time league MVP. \nWhile rubbing shoulders with some of the greatest running backs is history, Henry also makes a case as the best running back of his generation. A five-time Pro Bowl player, Henry is just one of nine players to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. Last year, his first with the Ravens, Henry led the NFL in rushing touchdowns for a third time while setting the single-season record for rushing yards gained by a player over the age of 30. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

On Thursday, the New York Giants announced that their rookie quarterback had officially cleared the concussion protocol, meaning he could be back in the starting lineup when the Giants take on the New England Patriots in Foxborough, Massachusetts, this week on \"Monday Night Football.\" Dart has missed the last two games with a concussion he suffered against the Chicago Bears in Week 10, which was Brian Daboll's final contest as the Giants coach. Interim coach Mike Kafka made the decision to start Jameis Winston in Dart's place, and while the former No. 1 overall pick did bring a spark to New York's offense, he couldn't bring any wins. The 2-10 Giants have lost six straight games, and became the first team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention last week. Dart is 2-5 as the starter this season, and has completed 62.7% of his passes for 1,417 yards, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions in nine total games played. The first-round pick out of Ole Miss has made a major impact with his legs, rushing 57 times for 317 yards and seven touchdowns. Dart has rushed for a touchdown in five consecutive games, which is the longest streak by any rookie quarterback since 1970. \nThe Giants are still searching for their first road win this year. New York is 0-7 away from MetLife Stadium this season despite holding double-digit leads in five of those seven games.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest nonconference games of the 2025-26 college basketball season will take place on Thanksgiving when No. 4 Duke faces No. 22 Arkansas in the CBS Sports Thanksgiving Classic. This will mark the second consecutive year that the Razorbacks play on Thanksgiving on CBS. Illinois defeated Arkansas 90-77 last year in a holiday showdown.This matchup will feature some of the best freshmen in the country on the same court. The headliner of this game is Duke forward Cameron Boozer, who is a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. On the other side, Arkansas has two potential lottery picks in Meleek Thomas and Darius Acuff Jr.Duke is off to a 7-0 start for the first time since the 2021-22 campaign. The Blue Devils are looking to start a season 8-0 for the first time since the 2017-18 season, a year in which Duke reached the Elite Eight.\n        \n            \n                John Calipari, Arkansas preparing for physical 'battle' vs. Duke in CBS Thanksgiving Classic\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nArkansas is off to a 5-1 start in Year 2 of the John Calipari era, with the lone loss coming to Michigan State earlier this month. The Razorbacks are 4-9 against ACC competition since the start of the 2014-15 season.\nHere is everything you need to know ahead of the marquee matchup. Where to watch Duke vs. Arkansas live  Date: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: United Center -- ChicagoTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ Premium  Duke vs. Arkansas: Need to knowDuke could have the No. 1 pick, again: The race for the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft will likely be between three players: Boozer, Kansas' Darryn Peterson and BYU's AJ Dybansta. While Boozer will be drafted behind those players this summer, he is off to an incredible start to the season and is on track to become the latest member of the Duke program to be drafted in the top three. Last season, Cooper Flagg won National Player of the Year as a freshman and became the No. 1 overall pick. Through three weeks, Boozer should be in the conversation for both.Coach Cal has two elite freshmen: When Calipari was the coach at Kentucky for 15 years, he routinely produced first-round picks. That streak ended last summer, as Arkansas/Calipari didn't have a player selected in the first round. If the early returns are any indication, it's that the drought won't last long. Acuff and Thomas are both playing at an elite level. Both should be drafted high this summer. Acuff and Thomas are both in the top 10 of CBS Sports' latest freshmen rankings.\nDuke has a gauntlet upcoming: Duke's matchup against Arkansas will mark the second team Scheyer's program has faced this season. The upcoming stretch of games will be more of where that came from. The Blue Devils face reigning national champion Florida next week at home in the ACC/SEC Men's Challenge and also have nonconference games against Michigan State and Texas Tech before ACC play begins.Duke vs. Arkansas prediction, picks\nThis game is going to come down to the play of the freshman on both sides. Can Arkansas slow Boozer down? That's the biggest key in this game. Boozer has looked like a force during the first few weeks of the season. He is a walking double-double capable of taking over a game. Look for Boozer to have a big performance and Duke to cover the spread. Pick: Duke -10.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            DUKE -10.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Arkansas\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Duke\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

Now, in Week 13, those hopes are set to be realized, with the star quarterback expected to make his anticipated return against the rival Baltimore Ravens.In theory, Burrow's return couldn't come at a more perfect time. The Bengals are undeniably desperate, looking to avoid their fifth straight loss after dropping eight of nine contests since Burrow's exit, and yet the AFC North race is far from over. The Ravens are technically on top at 6-5, but their own signal-caller, Lamar Jackson, hardly looks himself. And the division's second-place squad, the Pittsburgh Steelers, are no firmer thanks to a streaky defense and banged-up Aaron Rodgers.Yet if the Bengals couldn't even win while Burrow's emergency fill-in, Joe Flacco, enjoyed big-play production earlier this year, should we really expect a different outcome for Cincinnati on Thursday night? Either way, the third and final matchup of this year's 2025 Thanksgiving slate is must-see material.Bet Ravens vs. Bengals at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch Bengals-Ravens on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Bengals liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium (Baltimore)TV: NBCFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -7, O/U 51.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            How ready is Joe Burrow, really? Coach Zac Taylor insists his quarterback is \"in good shape\" after a nine-game absence. It helps Burrow also got some practice reps in ahead of the Bengals' last game. Still, the Pro Bowler is returning earlier than initially expected from a severe turf toe injury, and we just saw in San Francisco, with Brock Purdy, what can happen when recovery timelines are rushed. Up against an improved Ravens defense on a short week, this profiles as a tall task for No. 9.Can the Bengals slow Derrick Henry? The Ravens' star running back has been much more erratic this year than last, but he's helped carry Baltimore's grind-it-out attack since Lamar Jackson's return from injury, including with three touchdowns over the last two weeks. After mustering just 3 yards per carry against the New York Jets, this could be just the matchup for him to find daylight, as the Bengals are surrendering 156 rushing yards per game, which is ranked 31st in the entire NFL.Can Ja'Marr Chase single-handedly outrace Baltimore's secondary? The Ravens were surprisingly docile on defense to open the year, but they've tightened up since mid-October, allowing 17 or more points just once during their five-game win streak. Chase is arguably the NFL's top playmaker out wide, especially when Burrow is feeding him downfield opportunities, but he's coming off a one-game suspension and will be without top running mate Tee Higgins, who's sidelined with a concussion.You can bet Ravens vs. Bengals at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nOnce a ball-hawking member of the Ravens' secondary, Stone is coming off his splashiest outing of the 2025 campaign in Cincinnati, logging a pick six against Drake Maye and the New England Patriots to help the Bengals flirt with an upset. Practicing against Lamar Jackson and Co. for his first four NFL seasons might give Stone at least some advantage going into this matchup. But Jackson's recent inefficiencies as a passer might be the best thing working in Stone's favor; let's say Lamar gets a little too impatient while seeking the big play for Baltimore, giving his old friend a chance to steal a possession for the Bengals.Prediction\nIt's true that even when Flacco was dealing as Burrow's replacement, the Bengals failed miserably in other facets, be it situational coaching or general defensive competence. But there might be something to the notion that Burrow's return will put a little extra pep in everyone's step. The Ravens' own scattershot offense is another reason to believe this could be a pristine night for Burrow and Chase to reestablish their home run connection and throw another wrench into an already messy AFC North tangle.That said, we hesitate to put too much trust into a Zac Taylor-led operation that's routinely struggled to look prepared, and Higgins' absence should allow Baltimore to really hone in on lessening Chase's impact. There's also the distinct possibility of Jackson rediscovering his own juice as a rusher, with the bruising Henry by his side, against such a porous run \"D\" in Cincy. We anticipate some holiday fireworks before the buzzer, but give us the home team to scrape one out on Thanksgiving night.\nPick: Ravens 26, Bengals 22 | Bengals +7, Under 51.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Plenty of times in recent college football history, there have been cases where a rivalry is created out of thin air and foisted upon fan bases as a real thing. That could've been the case when Nebraska joined the Big Ten and needed a new team to play on Black Friday after spending the previous two decades facing Oklahoma or Colorado.Iowa seemed a natural choice, but the Hawkeyes had other traditional rivals in the Big Ten, so nothing was guaranteed.Well, here we are, 15 years later, and there's very little pretending still being done. These fan bases are going after each other all year long, and some on both sides might even tell you they dislike the other more than their other older, traditional rivals. Both teams enter the game licking some wounds. Iowa was a playoff contender a few weeks ago, but close losses to Oregon and USC ended those hopes. Nebraska had a shot too before quarterback Dylan Raiola broke his leg.Now they enter the final week of the regular season with one thing in mind: ruin the other's Thanksgiving weekend.\nIowa vs. Nebraska: Need to know  Iowa has controlled the Big Ten rivalry: These two played plenty of times before sharing a conference, and Nebraska leads the all-time series 30-22-3. However, Nebraska's lead was much larger before it entered the Big Ten. Nebraska won the first two meetings in 2011 and 2012, but Iowa's taken 10 of 12 since, including the last two. Iowa has also won six straight meetings at Memorial Stadium.  Iowa loves November: The Hawkeyes lost their first two games in November this season, which is a rarity for them. Those losses dropped their record in the month to 19-4 since the 2020 season. It's the fourth-highest win percentage among FBS teams in that time.  Nebraska looking to end a nearly decade-long drought: If the Cornhuskers get the win here it'll give them a record of 8-4 on the season. That's a big deal because it would be the first time the Huskers won eight games in a season since 2016. It would also be the first time they won five Big Ten games since that same season when they finished 6-3 in conference play.\n  Where to watch Iowa vs. Nebraska live  Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Memorial Stadium -- Lincoln, NebraskaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ PremiumIowa vs. Nebraska prediction, picks\nWe throw out the record books in rivalry games like this because anything can happen, so I'm not sure who will win, or who will cover. However, I don't expect there to be a lot of points scored in this one. It's going to be cold at Memorial Stadium, and with TJ Lateef at QB for the Cornhuskers now, this team has leaned heavily on its rushing attack. Iowa's been a run-heavy team all year. Unless we see a lot of explosive rushing plays (not out of question) or numerous defensive and special teams scores (also not out of the question!), I don't think either offense does enough to put a lot of points on the board. After all, the last two meetings have finished with 13-10 scores.  Pick: Under 38.5Who will win and cover in each Week 14 college football rivalry game?

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots and New York Giants both will have their eye on a prize when they meet in Week 13 of the 2025 NFL season at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. on Monday Night Football. However, the clubs are looking to obtain very different prizes.New England (10-2) has a few rewards in its sights, such as its first AFC East title since 2019 and the top overall seed in the conference come playoff time. The Patriots enter Week 13 with a 2.5-game lead over the Buffalo Bills, who have captured the division crown each of the last five seasons, and are a half game ahead of the Denver Broncos (9-2) for the No. 1 seed in the AFC.Mike Vrabel's tenure as head coach of the team with which he won three Super Bowls as a player got off to a rocky start as New England lost two of its first three games this year. However, the Patriots haven't been defeated since, as they enter Monday night's matchup with the Giants having won nine consecutive contests.\nThe Patriots have scored at least 23 points in every game during their winning streak and have won four straight at home by a combined total of 62 points. They now host a Giants squad that has lost six consecutive contests and leads the NFL with five setbacks this season in which it owned a lead in the fourth quarter.New York (2-10) became the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention with last week's 34-27 overtime loss to the Detroit Lions. The Giants possess the worst record in the NFC and are very much alive in the running for the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, as only the Tennessee Titans (1-10) are below them in the league standings.New England has been strong on both sides of the ball this year, ranking eighth in both total offense (359.9 yards) and defense (301.2 yards allowed). The Patriots are sixth in the league in passing (247.5 yards) and seventh in scoring (26.5 points), while they are the second-best team against the run (87.7 yards allowed) and sixth in points allowed (18.8).Drafted third overall in 2024, Drake Maye leads the NFL with 3,130 passing yards and ranks fourth with 21 touchdown tosses. The 23-year-old should come up with a solid performance against the Giants, who are last in the league against the run (157.2 yards allowed), 30th in both total defense (385.0) and points allowed (27.8) and 23rd against the pass (227.8 yards allowed).SportsLine's Inside the Lines team currently doesn't see how the Patriots don't put an end to their three-year postseason drought, and it says a loss to New York won't do much to reduce their chances.According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, New England also is an overwhelming favorite to end Buffalo's five-year reign atop the AFC East regardless of the result of Monday night's contest.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 13 WINWITH WEEK 13 LOSSDIFFERENCENew England Patriots99.4%100.0%98.1%1.9%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC EASTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 13 WINWITH WEEK 13 LOSSDIFFERENCENew England Patriots86.9%88.9%81.6%7.3%Buffalo Bills13.1%17.9%7.4%10.5%Miami Dolphins0.0%0.0%0.0%0.0%New York Jets0.0%0.0%0.0%0.0%The Giants have owned the first overall draft pick twice in their history. They most recently had the distinction in 1965, when they selected Auburn running back Tucker Frederickson ahead of future Hall-of-Famers Dick Butkus, Gale Sayers, Joe Namath and Fred Biletnikoff.Entering Week 13, the ITL team's model gives New York just the seventh-best chance to secure the No. 1 pick in 2026, as it projects the club to post 4.4 victories this season.TEAMCHANCE OF HAVING NO. 1 OVERALL DRAFT PICKTennessee Titans55.16%New York Jets14.55%Las Vegas Raiders10.90%New Orleans Saints8.95%Arizona Cardinals3.96%Washington Commanders2.45%New York Giants2.34%Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who missed the Giants' previous two games, has cleared concussion protocol and is expected to start against the Patriots on Monday Night Football. New England is a 7.5-point favorite against New York in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 28-19 victory for the Patriots, which would move them one step closer to their 22nd AFC East title and the 23rd division crown in franchise history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It doesn't get much better than The Game this week. Bragging rights, an undefeated season and College Football Playoff spots are on the line when Michigan hosts Ohio State on Saturday in the most heated rivalry in the sport.It's been a year since No. 1 Ohio State (11-0) last lost a game, and the culprit for that setback is No. 15 Michigan (9-2). No one will forget that improbable upset in Columbus, but knocking off the Buckeyes this year may be a bigger challenge. The Wolverines are gunning for their fifth straight victory in the series, which hasn't been done since the 1920s. The Buckeyes roll into Michigan Stadium with the nation's best defense, allowing only 7.6 points per game, the second-best mark by an FBS team over the last 30 years. Heisman Trophy contenders Julian Sayin, who is on pace to set the FBS single-season record for completion percentage, and Jeremiah Smith lead an explosive Buckeyes offense.Michigan is undefeated at home but has faced only one ranked opponent: No. 18 Oklahoma on the road.\nSaturday marks the 50th time both teams are ranked in The Game, the most between two teams in the AP poll era (1936). The Wolverines last defeated the No. 1 team in the AP poll in 1984 (Miami). Ohio State vs. Michigan: Need to knowHow healthy is Ohio State?  Star receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate sat out last week's win against Rutgers, but it appears both will play against Michigan, even though coach Ryan Day said earlier this week they are \"day to day.\" Smith and Tate are the Buckeyes' top two pass catchers, leading the way with 902 and 711 yards, respectively. Smith was held in check in last season's loss to the Wolverines, recording only 35 receiving yards.Can Michigan's offense keep it up? The Wolverines are without star running back Justice Haynes, and even backup Jordan Marshall sat out last week, and yet they managed to score 45 points and record 445 yards in a road win at Maryland. Freshman Bryce Underwood has thrown for 200-plus yards in each of the last two games -- both on the road. Michigan is 0-2 when falling below 350 total yards of offense; Ohio State is allowing only 206.6 yards. The key is Michigan's strong offensive line creating holes against Ohio State's stellar defensive front.\nMichigan's mind games: Hear us out: Is it possible that Day has a mental block when it comes to Michigan? The Ohio State coach is 52-1 in the Big Ten against all teams not named Michigan. He's 1-4 against the Wolverines.Sack Sayin: If Michigan wants to slow down this Ohio State offense, it needs to pressure quarterback Julian Sayin. He's completing passes at a record-breaking pace, and with the best receiver corps in the country, the Wolverines can't afford chunk plays. That's where a star like edge rusher Derrick More becomes so important. He has 9.5 sacks and 28 QB pressures.Wolverines' playoff hopes: As if a rivalry game wasn't enough to get the blood flowing, Michigan is likely also playing for a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Wolverines enter Saturday ranked No. 15 in the CFP, and though many teams above them are expected to hold serve, it will be difficult to keep them ranked below 11th in the final rankings if they defeat the previously unbeaten Buckeyes.\nHow to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Michigan Stadium -- Ann Arbor, MichiganTV: FOX | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Ohio State vs. Michigan prediction, picksIt hasn't been easy picking this game, and last season's result certainly provides a pause whenever assuming the Buckeyes could win by more than one touchdown, even on the road inside Michigan Stadium. The numbers show us that this Ohio State defense is even better than last season's, and though Michigan's offense has found some success of late, this defense is built differently, allowing barely over 200 yards. Don't touch the spread.  Pick: Ohio State SU\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n

    "body": "\n        No. 19 Tennessee is set to host No. 14 Vanderbilt Saturday for the 120th meeting all-time between two of the SEC's oldest rivals. There's plenty at stake for both teams, as they look to solidify their postseason standing in the final week of the regular season. Though the Vols and the Commodores first met in 1892, this will be the first time in series history that both are ranked inside the AP Top 25 -- and the College Football Playoff Rankings -- at kickoff. This is also just the fifth time that Vanderbilt can boast an AP ranking entering its game against Tennessee and the first since 1958. The Commodores are 1-3 in those meetings. They've also just won once in 42 meetings against AP-ranked Tennessee teams. That one win came in 2016. So history certainly is not on Vanderbilt's side as it looks to build its case for a College Football Playoff appearance. The Commodores have also lost their last six in a row against Tennessee. They have not won in Knoxville in eight years. \nBut Tennessee has undergone its own share of struggles this season. The Vols have yet to down a ranked team and they have struggled against some of the SEC's lower-tier teams like Mississippi State and Arkansas. There's still motivation to send the year out on a high note and secure a quality bowl game. Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt: Need to know  Biggest game in Vanderbilt history: The stakes are simple for Vanderbilt: Win, and it gives itself a good chance to snag an at-large bid in the College Football Playoff. That the Commodores have a chance to do this on the road against their oldest active rival only adds to the importance. Vanderbilt is also seeking 10 wins in a single season for the first time in program history. The Commodores are the only current Power Four team without a 10-win campaign on record. There's no doubt that this is the biggest game that Vanderbilt has ever played, especially since the Commodores have not so much as won a conference title in the modern era of college football.     \nA lot on the line for Tennessee, too: Tennessee is virtually out of the College Football Playoff race at this point. The Vols have yet to snag a victory against an FBS team with a winning record and they're 0-3 against ranked opponents this season. But they do have a chance to win nine games for a fourth straight season, something they have not done since 1995-99. For rivalry purposes, Tennessee can also spoil Vanderbilt's Cinderella story which, after winning at Florida for the first time in 22 years, would be a nice cherry on top of a decent season for the Vols.    Vanderbilt's Pavia closing in on another record: Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia already holds the Vanderbilt record for most touchdowns passing in a season at 26. He leapt past former Commodore star Kyle Shurmur in the process. Now, he's just 254 yards away from surpassing Kurt Page for the most yards passing in a single season in program history. Pavia, who has 2,924 yards through the air on the year, is also close to becoming just the fourth Vanderbilt quarterback to exceed 3,000 yards passing in a single season. Both feats are certainly doable against a Tennessee secondary that ranks near the bottom of the SEC.   Where to watch Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt live  Date: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Neyland Stadium -- Knoxville, Tennessee  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\n  Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt prediction, picks  Tennessee currently ranks 14th in the SEC in total defense (378.5 yards per game). Vanderbilt ranks 11th in the SEC in total defense (353.4 ypg). Tennessee has held just one conference opponent below 30 points all season. Vanderbilt allowed an average of 32 points in its two games against top-20 foes this season. Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar is just the fifth 3,000-yard passer in program history.

The Dallas Cowboys play host to the Kansas City Chiefs on CBS in what has to be one of the most anticipated regular-season games in a long, long time, and we're not talking about just on Thanksgiving.This is a battle of America's teams, or perhaps America's most hated teams. Whether you love them or hate them, it's going to be hard to turn away on Thanksgiving. NFL past dynasty vs. present dynasty will clash in a critical game with a lot at stake and absolutely no shortage of star power. Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones, Andy Reid, Jerry Jones, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and more.\nBoth teams are fighting for their playoff lives coming off historic comebacks. It's also a homecoming for Texas native Mahomes. Taylor Swift's fiancé will be playing. Post Malone will be performing at halftime. This game has something for everyone and I cannot wait.Bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:\nHere's everything you need to know to catch Chiefs-Cowboys on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:Where to watch Cowboys vs. Chiefs liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -3.5, O/U 52.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key storylinesCritical game in playoff hunt with both teams on outside looking in: No game has more at stake this week than the Cowboys and Chiefs. The Chiefs are 6-5 coming off the largest fourth-quarter comeback win of Mahomes' career (down 11 vs. Colts) and the Cowboys are 5-5-1 after matching the largest comeback win in team history (down 21 vs. 8-2 Eagles). Both are on the outside of the playoffs looking in right now as the No. 10 seeds in their respective conferences. There's work to do. The winner will enhance their playoff chances while a loss wouldn't quite burst anyone's playoff bubble, but would do a lot of damage, especially in Dallas' case. Kansas City has more at stake than any team in the league right now. The Chiefs have historic streaks in jeopardy, going for an 11th straight playoff appearance, eighth straight AFC title game and fourth straight Super Bowl this year.Chiefs taking over as America's team: This game is going to bring families together. They might be united in their hatred toward two of the NFL's most polarizing franchises, but at least they'll be in it together. You could call this a clash of the NFL's  \"evil empires,\" two accomplished franchises with giant targets on their backs. A matchup of two of the NFL's last three dynasties (sandwiching the 2001-19 Patriots in the middle). The Cowboys won three Super Bowls in the 90s (1992, 1993, 1995) and the Chiefs have won three since drafting Mahomes (2019, 2022, 2023). It's been well documented the Dallas Cowboys are \"America's Team\" but that torch has probably been passed to the Chiefs. Kansas City has made seven straight AFC title games, but Dallas hasn't made an NFC Championship since 1995, the longest active drought in the conference. Mahomes has more Super Bowl MVPs (three) than Prescott has playoff wins (two). A game with more cinema than anyone could imagine will fittingly be played at the NFL's greatest theater, Jerry World. Mahomes homecoming: It will also be a homecoming for Mahomes. He grew up a diehard Cowboys fan just 1.5 hours from Dallas in Tyler, Texas. Remarkably, this is Mahomes' first NFL start at AT&T Stadium. Be ready for a show though as he put up video game numbers in three games at Jerry World when he was at Texas Tech (all neutral site games vs. Baylor). Mahomes averaged over 500 passing yards and five touchdowns in three games at Jerry World, including a 586-yard, six-touchdown performance in the last game of his college career in 2016. Those are crazy numbers, even if it was on a team known for playing a lot of track meets.George Pickens can continue to feast: If Mahomes doesn't provide the fireworks, look to George Pickens, one of the best offseason additions in the entire NFL. He has the second-most receiving yards (1,054) in the NFL this season and the most ever in a player's first 11 games in a Cowboys uniform. He's quickly reaching star status, especially after the damage he did in the Cowboy's Week 12 comeback vs. the Eagles, racking up 133 yards after Dallas trailed 21-0. He's making a Terrell Owens or Randy Moss type impact and he's seemingly good for one 'You Got Moss'd' moment every game. I'm not saying he's going to have an impact like Moss infamously did at Dallas on Thanksgiving in 1998 (three catches, 163 yards, three touchdowns) but I wouldn't be surprised if he caught a deep ball or two. It won't be easy for Kansas City to take him away, either, with All-Pro Lamb on the other side.Cowboys defense can continue turnaround with Quinnen Williams: It would have been easy to write off the Cowboys' season a few weeks ago because of a slow start and horrible defense but Jerry Jones' bold move to trade a first- and second-round pick at the deadline for Quinnen Williams has immediately paid off. The long-term ramifications could be a different story but for now Dallas has won two straight games since Williams made his season debut and the defense has been a big reason why. The Cowboys dominated the trenches vs. the Raiders and Eagles, ranking among the league leaders in pressures (38, third) and rushing yards allowed (45.0 per game, second) in the last two weeks. Rookie first-round pick Ashton Jeanty couldn't get anything going vs. Dallas rejuvenated the line (six carries, 7 yards) and the same could be said of Saquon Barkley (10 carries, 22 yards). The Chiefs might not have a dynamic back, but Kareem Hunt has been lethal in short yardage situations and Mahomes is always a nightmare outside the pocket so Williams could have a huge impact again.You can bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Travis Kelce's first Thanksgiving game in the NFLFor all the star power on the field, one player might have the most off it. Kelce (and most of the Chiefs) will be playing in their first NFL game on Thanksgiving. Kelce may be slowing down at age 36, but he's still finding a way to be productive. He leads the Chiefs with 674 yards receiving this season and is on pace to become the oldest tight end in NFL history with 1,000 yards receiving in a season. He's never one to shy away from a big stage so expect him to be in the middle of all the action on Thursday. \nPost Malone performs the halftime showThis is a game for everyone. From casual to hardcore NFL fans, Swifties and entertainment enthusiasts. Lifelong Cowboys fan Post Malone will have you covered with the latter as he takes the stage at Jerry World during halftime. Malone has performed at NFL events and games before, including last Christmas when he joined Beyoncé for her halftime show in Houston.\"I'm from Texas. I grew up a Cowboys fan and have been watching this halftime show for years,\" Post Malone said. \"It's a real honor to be part of the Red Kettle Kickoff with The Salvation Army and the Dallas Cowboys and help bring hope to so many people.\"Post Malone has 18 Grammy nominations, 11 Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards and six MTV Video Music Awards. The \"Sunflower\" singer has explored many genres in his career, from rap to country to rock.\nPost Malone joins some elite company as Cowboys Thanksgiving Day performers, dating back to Reba McEntire taking the stage in 1997. Randy Travis, Destiny's Child, Sheryl Crow, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Enrique Inglesias, Selena Gomez and the Jonas Brothers are some other performers in the exclusive group.Prediction\nIt's been an up-and-down season for both teams which is why they are hovering right around .500. It's hard to know which version of each team is going to show up on Thursday, but I'm giving Dallas a slight edge. They play better at home (3-1-1 this season vs. 2-4 on road) while the Chiefs have struggled on the road (1-4). This will be a great test to see if the Cowboys' turnaround on defense is legitimate and they could have a leg up in the trenches with Chiefs Pro Bowl guard Trey Smith expected to miss time with an ankle injury. The Cowboys could suddenly be looking more complete on both sides of the ball so I'm taking them to pull off the upset at home in a close game. Pick: Cowboys 27, Chiefs 24 | Cowboys +3.5, Under 52.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        No. 7 Ole Miss and Mississippi State will do battle Friday afternoon for the 122nd installment of the Egg Bowl, one of the most underrated rivalry games in all of college football. Though the Rebels tout the ranking entering this rivalry showdown, there's a lot on the line for both teams. Ole Miss could secure an at-large bid in the College Football Playoff with a win. The Rebels are also hunting their third straight series win, which is something they have not accomplished since 2002-04. They do hold a 66-46-6 all-time advantage against Mississippi State. Mississippi State, meanwhile, could attain bowl eligibility by beating Ole Miss. The Bulldogs have not been to the postseason since 2022, when they downed Illinois in the ReliaQuest Bowl. They also have not finished above .500 in that same span. Mississippi State will have homefield advantage, but Ole Miss is actually 2-0 in the last two games played in Starkville. The Bulldogs have not beat the Rebels within the friendly confines of Davis Wade Stadium in six years. State fans also haven't seen a home victory this season since Sept. 20, when the Bulldogs downed Northern Illinois. \nOle Miss vs. Mississippi State: Need to knowAll eyes on Lane Kiffin: The Egg Bowl is appointment viewing, but a lot of the focus around this year's rivalry game is off the field. Kiffin is currently weighing his future with Ole Miss. The noise swirling around his pending decision -- Florida and LSU are each trying to convince him to fill their coaching vacancies -- got so loud that athletic director Keith Carter released a statement saying that Kiffin's final decision will come the Saturday after Ole Miss' game against Mississippi State. Kiffin's conundrum will surely be on everyone's minds as the game goes on. Ole Miss looking to make program history: Not only can Ole Miss lock down a College Football Playoff spot with a win against its in-state rival, but the Rebels can also make a little history. With a win, they would improve to 11-1. That would tie the program record for the most wins in a season -- set in 2023, when Kiffin's Rebels went 11-2 -- and it would also be the first time that Ole Miss has ever won 11 regular season games.  Mississippi State trying to snap skids: While Ole Miss is on the precipice of making history, Mississippi State is one win away from bowl eligibility. That's a little extra motivation for the Bulldogs, who have not won six-plus games since 2022. They're also 2-21 in conference play since the start of the 2023 season, which is the worst mark among FBS teams. Mississippi State has not won against an AP top-10 team since 2020. It's 0-10 since. The Bulldogs can reverse all of those trends and secure a postseason appearance by downing Ole Miss. \nWhere to watch Ole Miss vs. Mississippi State liveDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Davis Wade Stadium -- Starkville, Mississippi TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Ole Miss vs. Mississippi State prediction, picks\nDistractions aside, this is a game that Ole Miss should win handily. The Egg Bowl is a weird game, so it can be hard to predict, but the Rebels have a distinct advantage in almost every major category. They should be able to move the ball at-will against a Mississippi State team that ranks 15th in the SEC in total defense (393.2 yards per game) and scoring defense (28.4 points per game). Ole Miss wins by at least a touchdown (plus the extra point) for the third year in a row. Pick: Ole Miss -6.5 (-120)\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chip Patterson\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Brandon Marcello\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    John Talty\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Richard Johnson\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Shehan Jeyarajah\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Brad Crawford\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chris Hummer\n                            \n            Ole Miss -7.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miss.

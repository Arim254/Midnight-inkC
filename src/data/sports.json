    "body": "\n        A Saturday tripleheader of 2025 College Football Playoff first-round games begins with the No. 7 Texas A&M Aggies hosting the No. 10 Miami (Fla.) Hurricanes. The Aggies (11-1) won their first 11 games before falling to the Texas Longhorns, 27-17, on Nov. 28. The Hurricanes (10-2) have won four in a row and last defeated Pitt, 38-7, on Nov. 29. This 2025 CFP First Round Game will be the third meeting between the programs since 2022, with the teams splitting the first two matchups.Kickoff is at noon ET from Kyle Field in College Station, Texas. The Hurricanes prevailed 48-33 when the teams last met in Miami in 2023. The Aggies are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Miami vs. Texas A&M odds, while the over/under is 48.5.

Additionally, the Aggies have struggled versus the line since Mike Elko came onboard in 2024, as A&M is just 8-17 ATS since then, with that 32% cover rate being the third-worst amongst Power Conference teams over that span. QB Carson Beck tops the ACC in both completion rate (74.7%) and passing rating (165.8), and his top target, Malachi Toney, is coming off back-to-back games with 125+ receiving yards and a touchdown. That offensive firepower sometimes overshadow the fact that Miami also has the No. 6 scoring defense in FBS and allowed just 16.3 points to its four ranked opponents. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Texas A&M can coverMiami has a recent history of not showing up for bowl games as the Canes have lost six in a row, which is one shy of the longest active streak in the nation. Additionally, Miami is on an eight-game road losing streak versus AP Top-10 teams. Those trends will bring A&M confidence, as will having dynamic playmakers on both sides of the ball. QB Marcel Reed led the SEC with 14 yards per completion and is a threat with both his arm and legs. Reed has more games with 4+ total touchdowns (four) than he has with one or fewer touchdowns (three). Meanwhile, on defense, DE Cashius Howell's 11.5 sacks top the SEC and rank fourth-most in all of FBS. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Miami vs. Texas A&M picksAfter simulating Texas A&M vs. Miami 10,000 times, SportsLine's model is going Over on the total as the teams combine for 61 points. The model also says one side of the spread hits almost 60% of the time in an A-rated pick. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Miami vs. Texas A&M, and which side of the spread hits almost 60% of the time in an A-rated pick? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Texas A&M vs. Miami spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's up on its top-ranked money-line picks, and find out.\n            ",

This is arguably a tougher test for Dallas than others they didn't pass the past two weeks.

R.J. White is +585 on his past 281 NFL picks, and he's backing Jalen Hurts as an anytime TD scorer in the early kick. \"The Eagles finally got back on track against the Raiders, and this is another good matchup for their offense,\" White said. \"The Washington defense has allowed 3+ TDs in every game played stateside since Week 6, and giving up 21 points and 384 yards to the Giants last week represents one of their best outings in that stretch. We're used to seeing Hurts' ATD prop at much shorter odds in this type of matchup, and even if Lane Johnson isn't able to make it back this week, I think he shouldn't be plus odds to score against a defense that gives up loads of points.\" Get more Eagles vs. Commanders picks here and see Packers vs. Bears picks right here. \n            ",

The 2025 college football season was filled with drama and intense conference championship races, but now it's time to find out who the best in the nation truly is. Indiana's enters this year's playoff as the No. 1 seed on the heels of a win over Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game. Despite the loss, however, the Buckeyes did not fall very far from the top spot they previously held, as Ryan Day's team came in at No. 2. SEC champion Georgia enters as the third seed, while Big 12 champion Texas Tech rounds out the top of the field as the No. 4 seed. Those teams all earned first-round byes, but we have some tantalizing matchups coming in the first round. The playoff opens with four first-round games on Friday and Saturday before advancing to the quarterfinals at some of college football's most iconic bowl venues. Quarterfinal winners will move on to the semifinals Jan. 8 and 9, leading up to the College Football Playoff National Championship Monday, Jan. 20, at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game, from the four first-round games played on campus to the CFP National Championship. \n                                                                    CBS Sports Graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma: 24Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami at (7) Texas A&M: Noon | ABC/ESPNKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss: 3:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (12) James Madison at (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | TNT/truTVAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl -- (2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) Winner: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) winner: Noon | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (8/9) Winner: 4 p.m. | ESPNRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (3) Georgia vs. (6/11) Winner: 8 p.m. | ESPNCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

We wanted Alvin Kamara to be taking on the Jets, but he's out for the fourth game in a row with a knee injury. Then, we were hoping it would be Devin Neal, but he was placed on injured reserve after hurting his hamstring in Week 15 against Carolina.So here we are with Estime in this dream matchup. Can you trust him? I'm willing to take the chance on him in several DFS lineups.He's a great bargain at $5,000 on DraftKings and $4,900 on FanDuel. And he could be awesome against the Jets, who are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs in the past five weeks. Over that span, the Jets have allowed 14 total touchdowns to running backs, and six guys have at least 90 total yards (TreVeyon Henderson, Derrick Henry, Robinson, Achane, Jaylen Wright, and Travis Etienne). It could be amazing for Estime.\nBut is he even the best running back for the Saints? Estime will share touches with Evan Hull, and we'll see who coach Kellen Moore leans on in Week 16.In Week 15 against Carolina, when Neal was injured, Estime had three carries for 11 yards and three catches for 39 yards on three targets, while Hull had four carries for 12 yards. At least one Saints reporter expects Estime to start, and I'm willing to take a chance on him in several lineups.We'll see if it works out. But the opportunity and matchup are great, and Estime could be a standout Fantasy running back in Week 16 against the Jets.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 16, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        Last month at the Players Era Championship in Las Vegas, after Texas took down then-No. 3 UCLA to set up a showdown with then-No. 2 South Carolina the next day, head coach Vic Schaefer took a moment in the press conference to make a bold statement.\"I thought down the stretch, Rori Harmon showed why she is the best point guard in the country,\" Schaefer said.This wasn't the first or last time that Schaefer made such a proclamation. But Harmon takes it to heart each time.\"For someone like Coach Schaefer, of his stature and his greatness, to think that of me is a pretty big deal and just something that I want to live up to,\" Harmon told CBS Sports. \"He has such a high standard for me to just come out and play as hard as I can and be that engine that my team needs to be on both ends of the floor. \n\"Yeah, I'm gonna take that challenge and try to live up to it every day. Not just showing up for games, but just being a good teammate and showing up for practice, playing hard and doing all the things that some people sometimes overlook. So yeah, I feel really happy that he thinks that about me. It feels really nice, but there's always room for me to improve.\"While some might call it a bold statement, it's not exactly far-fetched. Under Harmon's leadership, the Longhorns currently ranked No. 2 in the nation and are 13-0 heading into Sunday's matchup against South Dakota State (2 p.m. ET on CBS Sports Network). \nHarmon is averaging 9.3 points and 7.8 assists per game. In the last four games, she has registered 44 assists and only two turnovers. She almost got a triple-double against Northwestern State with 11 points, 10 assists and a career-high seven steals.\nTexas is known as a defensive powerhouse, but the team has improved significantly on offense this season. There were already high expectations for the Longhorns, but they made a loud statement in November by taking down UCLA and South Carolina in back-to-back games. Harmon did a solid job directing her team, but she also hit the game-winning shot against the Gamecocks to win the Players Era championship. \nWhile Madison Booker has certainly been a highlight for the team, and players such as Jordan Lee deserve a lot of credit for embracing bigger roles, the point guard has been the key to tying it all together. Schaefer compares Harmon to Houston Comets legend Kim Perrot, whom he described as \"the heart and soul of the team.\"\"She made them go. She was their energizer bunny,\" Schaefer said of Perrot. \"Their toughness kid. She was a little bitty card.\"\nEarlier this season, Harmon became Texas's all-time assist leader, and she could be breaking more records before she finishes her master's degree. She is currently third on the Longhorns' all-time career steals list and only needs 26 more to tie Linda Waggoner's record of 346 steals.\"She is involved in so many things,\" Schaefer said. \"But here is, to me, the separator: it's what she does on the defensive end. It's how hard she plays down there. It's how much love she has for that end. A lot of kids go down there because they just have to. Rori loves that end of the floor. She loves to make an impact on that end. She takes pride in making an impact on that end. Not many kids do that. A lot of them can score, a lot of them can pass, but most of them don't defend like Rori Harmon. That,  to me, is what separates her. She is good on offense, but she is also that good defensively.\"Texas reached the Final Four last season, but Harmon, who was coming back from a torn ACL, was not even playing her best basketball. She and Schaefer had a productive conversation at the end of the season and he has continued to cheer her on during this journey.\n\"Last season was pretty tough for me, even though we did have a great season and went to the Final Four,\" Harmon said. \"We just had a conversation, he was like, 'What do you think is different?' We acknowledged the fact that I spent most of the year just trying to find myself again, including that the previous summer I didn't really get to touch the floor as much up until the season started.\"But a lot of our conversations now are like, he's just really happy. You can tell when he's smiling at me, he'll just not say anything, he'll smile. You can tell he's just super happy that I've found myself again. And I'm really enjoying the game of basketball again. I feel like myself. I'm moving better than ever.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Are you a boxing fan who has been eagerly awaiting Jake Paul's downfall? Well, you may get their wish on Friday night when the social media influencer-turned-boxer squares off with the biggest test of his career in the form of two-time unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua (Netflix, 8 p.m. ET).Paul's career started off as little more than a sideshow, stopping fellow influencer KSI in a white-collar exhibition before knocking out another influencer, AnEsonGib, in his pro debut. Paul's second pro fight saw him score a viral knockout of former NBA star Nate Robinson on the undercard of the highly-watched event headlined by an exhibition between Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr.Paul then turned to facing a series of former UFC fighters, defeating Ben Askren, Tyron Woodley (twice) and Anderson Silva. Silva was the only of Paul's first five opponents who had any professional boxing experience, leading to calls for Paul to \"face a real boxer.\"Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!\nPaul did just that in his seventh pro fight, and it resulted in his first loss as Tommy Fury took a split decision win in a fight that saw Paul score a knockdown but ultimately fail to be active enough to win over two of the three ringside judges.After defeating former UFC star Nate Diaz, Paul scored back-to-back knockouts over club-level fighters before stopping another former UFC fighter and current BKFC star, Mike Perry.Bet Paul vs. Joshua at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nPaul then faced 57-year-old Mike Tyson in a shameless fight that saw Tyson unable to do much of anything while Paul carried the fight to the judges' scorecards. Another win over an aging former world champion followed as Paul took a decision win over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.Looking at that resume, you can see a pattern of Paul facing almost exclusively smaller, older and/or completely inexperienced boxers.\n        \n            \n                Jake Paul faces his toughest test to date as he makes a calculated business decision against Anthony Joshua\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat will not be the case on Friday, when Paul faces a much larger man in the 6-foot-6 Joshua, a 2012 Olympic gold medalist and two-time unified heavyweight champion of the world.\n\"Yeah, 100%. This is the Giants vs the Patriots 2007. I mean, the list goes on, but the odds are stacked against me,\" Paul said at the final press conference. \"There's no sporting teams in history that have gone together where it's this big of a difference in terms of skill, experience, resume, height, weight, etc. So this is going to be the biggest upset in the history of sports and you guys get to witness it.\"Bet Paul vs. Joshua at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:While Joshua is past his absolute prime, he is not so far removed as to not be capable of competing with the best heavyweights in the world.\nAfter a 15-0 start to his pro career, Joshua knocked out Charles Martin to capture the IBF heavyweight championship. After two successful defenses of the title, Joshua stopped Wladimir Klitschko to add the WBA belt to his collection. Two fights later, Joshua would grab a third belt, stopping Joseph Parker for the WBO title.The Parker fight, the 21st of Joshua's career, was the first time a Joshua opponent made it to the final bell.In June 2019, Joshua suffered a shocking TKO loss to Andy Ruiz Jr., losing his status as unified champion in the process. The Ruiz upset was one of the biggest in heavyweight boxing history -- something Paul fans use as proof that Joshua is a vulnerable fighter, even when heavily favored.\nJoshua got his revenge in a rematch with Ruiz, regaining his three world titles. After a single defense, Joshua finally met a fighter who was clearly his superior, losing a September 2021 fight to Oleksandr Usyk and dropping the rematch the following August.Joshua has won four of his five fights since the Usyk bouts, including a thunderous knockout of former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, before suffering a brutal knockout loss in an IBF title fight with Daniel Dubois.While no longer among the elite of the elite, Joshua remains a talented, strong, and large heavyweight and is a fighter unlike any Paul has shared the ring.\n\"Jake Paul creates a great challenge for me, and he's got a great mindset for sure,\" Joshua said. \"Great family, great brother, great person. So yeah, he definitely creates a good challenge for me. But as I said earlier, competition is really good.\"The undercard features more fighters from under the Most Valuable Promotions banner. That includes recent signing Alycia Baumgardner, who looks to defend her unified junior lightweight titles against Leila Beaudoin in the co-main event. Baumgardner, 31, reached undisputed status at junior lightweight in 2023. She made three defenses of the crown before vacating the WBC title to take this fight. Plus, former UFC champions are set to clash when Anderson Silva, 50, battles Tyron Woodley, 43, at cruiserweight. \"I feel like for me, it's my chance to go forward to increase my legacy. And for once, it's an opportunity for me to fight somebody that brings my value up,\" Woodley said at the final press conference. \"Anderson, that's the type of excitement that I got when the fight was requested. And it didn't take me long. I really said yes almost before we even talked about it, so it's time to get it on. Can't wait.\"\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Joshua vs. Paul fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookAnthony Joshua -1200 vs. Jake Paul +700, heavyweightsAlycia Baumgardner (c) -1400 vs. Leila Beaudoin +750, unified junior lightweight titleAnderson Silva -275 vs. Tyron Woodley +210, cruiserweightsJahmal Harvey -3500 vs. Kevin Cervantes +1300, junior lightweightsCherneka Johnson (c) -900 vs. Amanda Galle +550, undisputed bantamweight titleCaroline Dubois (c) -3500 vs. Camila Panatta +1300, WBC lightweight titleYokasta Valle (c) -1400 vs. Yadira Bustillos +700 .

If Jake Paul wins, it would be legitimately shocking. It would be a sport-shaking result -- and one many would refuse to accept as legitimate, no matter how little sense a fix would make. Joshua is bigger, stronger, more technical, has more power and high-level experience against some of the best fighters in the world. Paul has ... fought some guys people know who have all come into the fight with at least some degree of disadvantage.Anthony Joshua wins this fight 99 times out of 100. Paul's best trait is his power, and landing one big shot and knocking out Joshua is the way Paul wins that one fight out of 100. It's just very unlikely, and Paul's worst defensive traits, such as hanging around the ropes while not throwing punches, leaves him open to Joshua's power and sharp punching. In reality, every round Paul survives is a win in its own way.

    "body": "\n        Indiana is beginning its College Football Playoff journey with its first Rose Bowl appearance since 1968 as No. 1 seed IU will take on No. 9 seed Alabama in a quarterfinal showdown. The Hoosiers beat Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game to secure the top spot in the bracket, and now they have another blueblood in their sights with a spot in the CFP semifinals hanging in the balance.The winner will advance to the Peach Bowl on Jan. 9 in Atlanta to play (4) Texas Tech, (5) Oregon or (12) James Madison.In a bygone era, the concept of Indiana being a favorite over Alabama in such a high-stakes game would have been inconceivable. But it's a new day for Indiana football, which has risen to prominence under second-year coach Curt Cignetti with a transfer-fueled run for the ages.Alabama remains a formidable program stocked with blue-chip talent, but the Crimson Tide are in for a fight as they head west to take on a team that has been the most dominant in college football. After bouncing back from a lopsided SEC Championship Game loss to Georgia with a comeback win over No. 8 seed Oklahoma in the first round, the Crimson Tide appear to have regained their swagger.\nThese programs have never met, but they do have some connections. Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer served as the offensive coordinator for an 8-win Indiana team in 2019. Since then, he's proven his mettle as an FBS head coach during two-year stints at Fresno State, Washington and Alabama.Indiana coach Curt Cignetti worked as Alabama's wide receivers coach under Nick Saban from 2007-11 before starting a head coaching journey that took him through Division II, the FCS and the Group of Five. Indiana finally gave him a Power Five opportunity, and he's rewarded their faith by turning the Hoosiers into a juggernaut.\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about IndianaIndiana is completing one of the most stunning rises of college football history under second-year Cignetti, who has amassed a 24-2 record since arriving from James Madison. Cignetti inherited a program that had never won 10 games in its 125-year existence and has guided it to consecutive CFP appearances in a rapid rise that defies logic. The Hoosiers tabled any lingering doubt over their championship potential by beating then-No. 1 Ohio State 13-10 in the Big Ten Championship Game to secure the CFP's No. 1 overall seed.\nThe star is Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who has thrown 33 touchdowns against just six interceptions while completing 71.5% of his passes. But the Hoosiers are a balanced team with the nation's No. 10 rushing offense and a gnarly defense giving up just 10.8 points per game, which is No. 2 nationally. However, the joy of winning the program's first conference title since 1967 came with a cost, as star defensive end Stephen Daley suffered a fluke leg injury during the Big Ten Championship celebration. After leading the league with 19 tackles for loss, he'll be tough to replace.But during a season highlighted by eight wins of 24+ points, the Hoosiers had plenty of time to develop depth. On the rare instances they were challenged, Mendoza delivered in the clutch. Another factor working in IU's favor entering the playoff is that neither of its coordinators have accepted other jobs, allowing the Hoosiers to devote their full attention to capping a storybook season with a national title.\n    \n                                        \n    What to know about AlabamaAlabama entered its first-round CFP game at Oklahoma at just 2-2 over its previous four games and out of rhythm offensively. After falling behind 17-0 with a series of three-and-outs against the Sooners, the comatose Crimson Tide were on the precipice of ending a once-promising season with a whimper.  Everything changed in the second quarter as the Tide rallied for a 34-24 comeback victory.\nFor better or worse, quarterback Ty Simpson is the key for the Crimson Tide, which have only a spotty run game. At his best, Simpson is a surgically accurate passer at all levels of the field and a capable runner who orchestrates clock-bleeding drives with poise. At his worst, he's easily flustered in the pocket and prone to putting the football in harm's way. Bama's defense has done its part in guiding the team back from a season-opening loss at Florida State. Sophomore cornerback Zabien Brown singlehandedly changed the complexion of two games with pick-sixes. The first was a 99-yarder against Tennessee that effectively produced a 14-point swing in a 37-21 win. The next one was a 50-yarder late in the first half of the Crimson Tide's CFP win over Oklahoma. Alabama racked up five sacks against the Sooners as coordinator Kane Wommack's unit recovered from a slow start to suffocate the Sooners.Odds below via FanDuel SportsbookRose Bowl odds, predictionDoubt Indiana at your own peril, because the Hoosiers have met every challenge during a dominant 13-0 start. Their unbeaten mark includes an 8-5 record against the spread and straight-up wins over Oregon and Ohio State that both came away from home. Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza is comfortable executing in clutch situations, and the Hoosiers are lethal defensively. The Crimson Tide showed some grit in a comeback win over Oklahoma, but Indiana is a more complete team. Pick: Indiana -6.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in more than a decade, the Kansas City Chiefs will be playing the final three games of the 2025 regular season without playoff seeding on their mind. At 6-8, the Chiefs have been eliminated from playoff contention in the AFC. Plus, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL last week to turn this Chiefs season into a true disaster. There are plenty of questions facing the Chiefs about their future and how they'll build the roster next year with Mahomes hopeful to be ready for the start of the season. Among the biggest questions is whether Travis Kelce will be back. He continues to brush aside retirement questions, noting that will be a tougher conversation he has to have with himself and the team in the offseason, via ESPN.\"I think I'd rather just keep the focus on this team, right now,\" Kelce said. \"All the conversations that I have with the team moving forward will be with them. It's a unique time in my life. I've got three games left. Unfortunately, I've got three games left and I know when the season ends. Just trying to make sure everybody here knows that I'm focused on trying to win these last three games.\"\nWhile his long-term future remains up in the air, Kelce stated on Friday that he has no plans on sitting out any of the Chiefs' final three games despite being out of the playoff race with a backup QB.\"It's just integrity, man,\" Kelce said. \"I signed up to be a Chief, and I love doing what I do. I know I've been dreaming of being in these moments and playing for an NFL team since I was a kid. Getting back to that will give you more motivation than you could ever need. That's just how you need to go about work, whether you're in the race or not. I'm going to make sure these guys know I'm out there giving them everything I got.\" Kelce will try to help close the season out strong and provide some help for backup Gardner Minshew as he takes over the offense in Mahomes' absence. Kelce does have some individual accolades to play for. He is just 203 yards shy of another 1,000-yard season, which would make him the oldest tight end to reach that mark. \nThe Chiefs close with games against the Titans, Broncos and Raiders -- with the Denver game as their final home game of the season on Christmas Day. Kelce will certainly get a send-off from the Kansas City faithful in that game in case that is his final time at Arrowhead, and all eyes will be on his emotions after the game as a potential tell for his impending decision this offseason. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 College Football Playoff bracket is set, and the countdown is on for the beginning of the action. First-round games are set for Dec. 19-20 at on-campus locations before we get into quarterfinal play Dec. 31-Jan. 1. It all builds toward a champion being crowned Jan. 19 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami after what promises to be a captivating journey through a bracket stocked with intrigue.No. 9 Alabama got the College Football Playoff party started with a first-round comeback road victory over No. 8 Oklahoma on Friday night.  A triple-header is on the docket for the next day as the field will shrink to eight ahead of the quarterfinal round, which is centered around New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. That's when the top four seeds will make their CFP debuts. Can No. 1 seed Indiana complete its storybook march to the top of college football? Or will No. 2 seed Ohio State rebound from its Big Ten Championship Game loss to the Hoosiers and repeat as the national champion. No. 3 seed Georgia and No. 4 seed Texas Tech will also have something to say after winning the SEC and Big 12, respectively. Of course last season it was the Buckeyes who won it all as the No. 8 seed. Could a champion emerge from the 5-10 range once again?Our CBS Sports experts spent the season covering and analyzing all the action. Now, as the postseason dawns, they are sharing their predictions and analysis for how the 12-team playoff will unfold.\n2025-26 College Football Playoff bracket picksTom FornelliIndiana and Ohio State have been the two best teams in the country all season according to both the human and computer polls, and Saturday night's headbanger in Indianapolis confirmed it in my eyes. They will meet again, and I like Ohio State's chances of winning the rematch a little more than Indiana's. As for the rest, it's mostly chalk because that's how college football works most of the time. Some would say it's why we never needed 12 teams in a \"playoff\" to begin with. Chip PattersonNow that the College Football Playoff has gone to straight seeding the bracket has competitive balance, so it's highly unlikely that we will see the No. 7 seed and the No. 8 seed play in the national championship game like we did a year ago. The top five teams in the country on Selection Day are the only five teams I'd pick to win multiple games against this field, and then it's just a matter of who can be healthiest and best prepared for the rematches I've projected along the way. Ultimately I can't shake Ryan Day's comments after the Big Ten Championship Game loss where he noted that it will hurt the Buckeyes to have walked off the field without a trophy, and my prediction is now that Ohio State has encountered some real adversity it will attack the playoff run with a renewed edge and bring back-to-back 12-team CFP titles to Columbus. John TaltyMy bracket is mostly chalk, but this feels like an especially top-heavy year. I think the champion will be one of the following four teams: Georgia, Indiana, Ohio State or Oregon. I like Oregon to pull off the upset over Texas Tech, but fall just short again against the Hoosiers. Ohio State-Georgia will be a heavyweight fight and would be one of the best we see all year. I ultimately went with Ohio State to win it all because of its combination of elite offense and defense. Indiana did a tremendous job slowing down the Buckeyes in the Big Ten Championship, but think Julian Sayin and Co. will look better in a title game rematch. \nBrandon MarcelloTeams with first-round byes fared horribly last season in the playoff, but that won't be the case this year. I'm projecting the top four seeds to advance to the semifinals. From there, I'm going to trust the two best coaches in the country to push their teams into the national championship. Curt Cignetti has built Indiana into a legitimate title contender, particularly along that defensive line that sacked Ohio State's Julian Sayin five times. Georgia seems to be improving, and I continue to turn back to the second-half adjustments Kirby Smart made in an eventual loss to Alabama in the regular season. He shut the Tide down after falling behind early, and then took those lessons to smother them in the SEC Championship Game. In a battle of the two best coaches in the country, give me a Georgia team and coach motivated by the disappointment of a flat performance last season in the playoff. Shehan JeyarajahMatchups are everything in the College Football Playoff, especially with 12 teams that all have some holes. Alabama will avenge their flukey loss to Oklahoma, giving us the first \"upset\" of the first round. Additionally, the byes will prove far more valuable this year as national contenders have time to get healthy. That will prove especially valuable for Texas Tech, which will use a revitalized Behren Morton to upset Indiana and reach the title game. But while my faith in Ohio State is somewhat shaken after their struggles against the Hoosiers, they're still the most complete team in the country. The Buckeyes go back-to-back. Chris HummerIn a season generally defined by parity, it does feel like five teams have separated themselves from everyone else. It makes every pick in the first and second round feel pretty easy outside of Texas Tech versus Oregon. I feel like the country at large is undervaluing Texas Tech. The Red Raiders are a truly elite defense and an offense that can create a big play (1st nationally in plays of 20-plus yards) at any time. I think that carries Texas Tech to the national title game -- yes, even over Oregon and Indiana. As for the other side of the bracket, Ohio State and Georgia are destined to clash. It'll be a close game, but I just can't pick against Ohio State. Georgia is a physical, tough team peaking at the right time. But the Buckeyes don't have any obvious weaknesses while I still question elements of UGA, particularly consistency against the pass. As for the national title game ... that's when a boom (and occasionally bust) Red Raiders offense gets exposed. The Buckeyes become the first team since Georgia to win back-to-back national titles. \nDavid CobbConsider this my mea culpa on Texas Tech, a team that I predicted would be the most overrated in the Big 12. It turns out the Red Raiders were vastly underrated. Buying talent is one thing, but getting it to work together in a cohesive way is much more difficult, and that's what head coach Joey McGuire has done. But even after wiping the floor with the rest of the Big 12, Texas Tech still isn't getting the credit it deserves nationally for the wholesale dominance it showed all season. With a top-five offense and defense, the Red Raiders are poised to make some noise. Brad CrawfordIndiana and Ohio State have played in a different tier than the rest of college football throughout the season and Saturday night's Big Ten Championship Game result only re-emphasized that point to me. The selection committee nailed the top-4 seeding, despite many assuming Georgia's win over Alabama in Atlanta had clinched the No. 2. I didn't see it. The Hoosiers and Buckeyes dominate on both sides of the football and are destined to meet again next month. This time around, Ohio State will have better execution in the red zone and win the rematch for a second consecutive national title. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two SEC behemoths and two of the more iconic brands in the sport headline in the first round of the College Football Playoff as No. 9 Alabama travels to play No. 8 Oklahoma on Friday night. The Crimson Tide and Sooners are no strangers to one another, having met twice in the regular season since Oklahoma joined the conference ahead of the 2024 season. Alabama has had very little luck in the previous two matchups, however. The Sooners are 2-0 against the Crimson Tide in that span, including a 23-21 triumph this season that solidified Oklahoma's status as a legitimate playoff team. Oklahoma also knocked Alabama out of playoff contention last season when it pulled off a 24-3 upset of the Crimson Tide. This will be Oklahoma's first playoff appearance since 2019. The Sooners, who won just six games in 2024, turned things around with a 10-2 record in 2025 to earn their spot on college football's biggest stage. Alabama, meanwhile, is making its first playoff appearance under coach Kalen DeBoer, who is no stranger to the CFP; he led Washington to the national title game in 2023 before departing Seattle to succeed legendary Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban. \nFollow along for LIVE updates, highlights and expert analysis as Alabama travels to Oklahoma to kick off the College Football Playoff. Where to watch Alabama vs. Oklahoma liveDate: Friday, Dec. 19 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Memorial Stadium -- Norman, OklahomaTV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Oklahoma: Players to watchTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Alabama needs Simpson to be at his best, and he's been far from it since Alabama's first loss to Oklahoma. In the Crimson Tide's last four games, Simpson tossed five touchdowns to four interceptions. He's averaging 201.8 yards per contest in that span with two games under 200 yards passing. His completion percentage also dipped below 50% for the first time all season in Alabama's SEC Championship Game loss to Georgia. Simpson once looked like a legitimate Heisman Trophy contender, so the potential for a resurgence is there. \nGermie Bernard, WR, Alabama: Having a weapon like Bernard could help Simpson get back on track. Ryan Williams gets most of the attention after a breakout true freshman campaign, but Bernard is Alabama's best playmaker. He's a YAC monster that leads the Crimson Tide with 57 catches for 762 yards and seven touchdowns. Bernard is also the ideal safety valve for an ailing offense. The coaching staff likes to get him involved in multiple ways, be it as a route runner or on jet sweeps, so defenses have to account for that versatility. Bray Hubbard, DB, Alabama: Hubbard has emerged as one of the nation's premier ball-hawking safeties while anchoring Alabama's defensive backfield. The junior defensive back was an All-SEC First Team selection after tying for the conference lead with four interceptions. He is also the only player in the SEC with at least five pass deflections and four interceptions. Oh, and don't discount the three fumbles that Hubbard has forced. It's rare that one player creates that much havoc. Isaiah Sategna III, WR, Oklahoma: If there is one player that Alabama needs to have circled, highlighted and underlined on its defensive gameplan, it's Sategna. He is the engine behind Oklahoma's offense, and he's also one of the best big-play threats in college football. Sategna finished the regular season with 65 catches for 948 yards and seven touchdowns. His 14.6 yards per catch ranked second among SEC receivers with at least 60 receptions on the year. \nR Mason Thomas, EDGE, Oklahoma: Thomas' status is worth monitoring. He missed three games in November due to a quad injury, and his playoff outlook is up in the air. Even with the lost time, he was still an All-SEC selection after logging 6.5 sacks and 9.5 tackles for loss. He's a game-wrecking talent and Oklahoma's defense is obviously significantly better with him out there. Taylor Wein, EDGE, Oklahoma: Regardless of whether Thomas is unable to go, Wein has earned his spot on Oklahoma's defense. He stepped up in a major way in the wake of Thomas' injury and emerged as one of the SEC's most effective pass rushers down the stretch. He had 2.5 sacks and three tackles for loss in Oklahoma's last three games, and he had seven pressures in key victories against Alabama and Missouri. Alabama vs. Oklahoma prediction, pick\nWe've already seen this movie before. Oklahoma went on the road and beat Alabama in the regular season. The Sooners seem like a matchup nightmare for a Crimson Tide offense that has plummeted off a cliff since the start of November. Playing in a hostile environment certainly won't help Alabama. Alabama also has a solid defense, but Oklahoma has a key edge: the Sooners are great at forcing timely turnovers and producing points in multiple ways. Oklahoma consistently sets its offense up in ideal positions. The Sooners should be able to win pretty comfortably here. Pick: Oklahoma -1.5 (-105) \n            ",

College football bowl season provides an opportunity for fan bases to see their team one last time and get a sneak peek into the future as younger players get into the game. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \n\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia, Texas Tech earn byes; Miami in over Notre Dame\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        A giant missed opportunity.  That's what is looming for the loser of Saturday's showdown between No. 22 St. John's and Kentucky at the CBS Sports Classic. For St. John's, it's one last opportunity in nonconference play to notch its first Quad 1 victory of the season. For Kentucky, it's a chance to prove that it can get off the mat after being battered, bruised and tossed aside by Louisville, Michigan State, North Carolina and Gonzaga.  Oh, and there's history here. Pitino led Kentucky to the national championship in 1996. The captain of that club? Current UK coach Mark Pope. Fast-forward 29 years, and Pitino's prized offseason acquisition is former Kentucky forward Bryce Hopkins. Does familiarity breed contempt? Pope would push back on that fable, but there's so much on the line for two teams that have talent galore but still haven't quite found themselves. \nLet's dive into this matchup. \n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Where Kentucky, North Carolina stand before CBS Sports Classic; conference champions projected\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAll odds via FanDuel Sportsbook   Where to watch Kentucky vs. St. John's live   Date: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 12:30 p.m. ET Location: State Farm Arena -- Atlanta TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Kentucky vs. St. John's: Need to know Can St. John's guard the ball? Last season, there were no weak links in St. John's defense. That is not the case this season. The gameplan for good guards has been to find the mismatch and put 'em in the action as much as possible. Those targets specifically have been Ian Jackson, Joson Sanon or Dylan Darling, and it's led to big nights for Auburn's Tahaad Pettiford (27 points) and Alabama's Labaron Philon (25 points).  Overall, St. John's is allowing over 32 points per game in pick-and-rolls against high-major competition, per Synergy. Not good enough. The bully-ball gameplan that Kentucky used against Indiana won't work in this matchup against this uber-athletic St. John's frontcourt, but Jaland Lowe will have advantageous matchups at his disposal in pick-and-rolls. If Lowe plays well, Kentucky's got a real chance. \nSpotlight on the Bryce Hopkins-Mo Dioubate battle: Pitino has been a burr in Hopkins' saddle after a zero-rebound, three-turnover showing earlier this week against DePaul. I expect a rejuvenated effort from Hopkins against his former team, but Kentucky will very likely sic Dioubate onto him. This matchup could tilt the scales.  Can Hopkins check Dioubate and keep him from ravaging the offensive boards? Can Hopkins make good decisions under pressure and not let Dioubate change the game with takeaways for touchdowns? Can Dioubate defend without fouling? Hopkins is drawing a sky-high 6.4 fouls per 40 minutes. If Dioubate is in foul trouble, the tenor of Kentucky's defense changes dramatically.  Will Jayden Quaintance make his debut, and what does it look like? No Kentucky player has a higher NBA ceiling than Quaintance. Returning to game action 10 months after a torn ACL is remarkable, all things considered, but that's firmly on the table for the Arizona State transfer. The 6-9 big man is one of the best defenders in the country, period.  \nQuaintance practiced in full this week, but his status for Saturday is still up in the air. Even if he plays just 10 minutes, that's an enormous boon for a Kentucky front-line that will be tested by Hopkins, Zuby Ejiofor, Dillon Mitchell and Ruben Prey.  Kentucky vs. St. John's prediction, picks \nThis is an objectively brutal game to handicap. The best version of St. John's shows up in transition when Ian Jackson can show off his jet-like quickness, Mitchell can show off his run-and-jump skillset and Zuby Ejiofor can turn and burn. For the most part, Kentucky's defense has done a good job of limiting transition opportunities, but I don't think that holds in this matchup. Pitino has steered away from playing Mitchell, Ejiofor and Hopkins together lately, but I think this is the spot to unleash it again.  St. John's has totaled a 49.6% free-throw attempt rate and a gazillion shots at the rim when those three guys are on the floor together, per CBB Analytics. There's a path for St. John's to overwhelm Kentucky's consistently inconsistent frontcourt with a barrage of big-boy drives and offensive rebounds. Plus, if they can get Dioubate in foul trouble, it could be a bloodbath on the glass in the Johnnies' favor. \nSt. John's just knows where its bread is buttered right now more than Kentucky. Pick: St. John's -3.5  \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            STJOHN'S -3.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Kentucky\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            St. John's\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 16 is already off the rails, and we've barely gotten started. The NFL is coming off arguably the game of the year on Thursday night, when the Seattle Seahawks rallied to defeat the Los Angeles Rams in overtime, not only moving to 12-3 but also controlling their destiny in pursuit of the No. 1 seed in the NFC. That baton will be passed to the rest of the slate, which includes a doubleheader on Saturday and a slew of high-stakes games on Sunday. While the primary focus will be on how those games shape up and further clarify the playoff picture, we also need to pay attention to injuries. As is the case every week, injuries will play a big piece to how these matchups unfold, so it's important to know who is in, out, and has their status still in question. Below, we'll go through all the final injury reports for the remaining games in Week 16. All Week 16 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Philadelphia Eagles (-7) at Washington Commanders (Saturday)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusEaglesJalen CarterDTShoulderOutLane JohnsonOTFootOutCameron LatuTEStingerQuestionableCameron WilliamsOTShoulderQuestionableCommandersEddie GoldmanDTConcussionOutJayden DanielsQBLeft elbowOutLaremy TunsilOTObliqueOutColson YankoffTEAnkleOutJonathan JonesCBRibQuestionableJer'Zhan NewtonDTIllnessQuestionablePhiladelphia will continue to be without two key figures in the trenches as both Jalen Carter and Lane Johnson did not practice at all this week. Meanwhile, after missing Tuesday's session with a stinger, Saquon Barkley logged back-to-back full practices and carries no injury designation for Saturday. The Commanders have decided to shut Jayden Daniels down for the rest of the season, and he's since been officially ruled out. That means backup Marcus Mariota will get another start. He'll do so without his star left tackle as Larmey Tunsil is out with a strained oblique. Tunsil practiced on a limited basis on Wednesday, but was downgraded to a non-participant on Thursday. Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears (-1.5) (Saturday)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPackersJosh WhyleTEConcussionOutJohn WilliamsIOLBackOutMarShawn LloydRBCalf, hamstringOutChris BrooksRBChestQuestionableBrenton Cox Jr.DLGroinQuestionableKingsley EnagbareDLIllnessQuestionableJosh JacobsRBKnee, ankleQuestionableDarian KinnardOLNeckQuestionableCollin OliverDLHamstringQuestionableZach TomOLBack, kneeQuestionableChristian WatsonWRChest, shoulderQuestionableDontayvion WicksWRAnkleQuestionableEvan WilliamsSKneeQuestionableBearsLuther Burden IIIWRAnkleOutRome OdunzeWRFootOutAmen OgbongbemigaLBHamstringOutTremaine EdmundsLBGroinQustionableCole KmetTEAnkle, kneeQuestionableD'Andre SwiftRBGroinQuestionableJoe Tryon-ShoyinkaDLNot injury-relatedQuestionableThe notable names in Green Bay's lengthy injury report come on the offensive side of the ball with Josh Jacobs and Christian Watson, who are both questionable. Watson suffered a chest injury during Sunday's loss to the Broncos and needed to be examined at a local hospital. Fortunately, he avoided a significant injury, but his status for Week 16 is up in the air. He was limited on Wednesday and Thursday. As for Jacobs, the star back did not practice at all this week. Chicago's receiver room will be thin in Week 16 with both Rome Odunze and Luther Burden III sidelined for this matchup. Meanwhile, running back D'Andre Swift popped up on the injury report on Wednesday and logged back-to-back limited sessions due to a groin injury, which has him questionable. Buffalo Bills (-10.5) at Cleveland Browns\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBillsMatt PraterKRight quadOutJordan PhillipsDTAnkleOutChase LundtOTKneeOutCam LewisDBHamstringQuestionableMecole Hardman Jr.WRCalfQuestionableBrownsJack ConklinRTConcussionOutDavid NjokuTEKneeOutWinston ReidLBBackOutDylan SampsonRBHandOutDenzel WardCBCalfOutDeshaun WatsonQBAchillesOutSam KamaraDTElbowQuestionableWyatt TellerRGCalfQuestionableThe most notable development on Buffalo's injury report is who is not on it. Specifically, cornerback Christian Benford (toe) logged a full practice on Friday and carries no designation for this week, meaning he will suit up. Jack Conklin will miss his third-straight game due to a concussion, while Njoku will be sidelined for the second week in a row with a knee injury. Rookie running back Dylan Sampson did not practice this week due to a hand injury and has since been ruled out. As for right guard Wyatt Teller, he was limited in practice this week after missing both Week 14 and Week 15 with a calf injury, and is officially questionable. Cincinnati Bengals (-4.5) at Miami Dolphins\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBengalsNoah FantTEAnkleOutCharlie JonesWRAnkleOutJoseph OssaiDEAnkleOutTee HigginsWRConcussionQuestionableB.J.

Cincinnati also activated defensive end Shemar Stewart off of injured reserve. After missing the first two days of practice, linebacker Jordyn Brooks returned on Friday as a limited participant, which gives him a shot to play on Sunday as he's now listed as questionable. Los Angeles Chargers at Dallas Cowboys (-1.5)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusChargersRJ MickensSShoulderOutDerius DavisWRAnkleOutBud DupreeOLBBackQuestionableQuentin JohnstonWRGroinQuestionableElijah MoldenDBHamstringQuestionableTrey Pipkins IIIOLAnkleQuestionableTeair TartDLShinQuestionableCowboysDaRon BlandCBFootOutTyler GuytonOTAnkleOutJosh ButlerCBKneeQuestionableCaelen CarsonCBShoulder, HamstringQuestionableTrevon DiggsCBKneeQuestionableHunter LuepkeFBConcussionQuestionablePhil MafahRBShoulderQuestionablePayton TurnerDERibsQuestionableQuinnen WilliamsDTConcussionQuestionableJohnston and Pipkins both were limited throughout the week of practice for the Chargers, which gives them a good shot at playing on Sunday. Quarterback Justin Herbert was listed on the injury report throughout the week with his left hand injury, but he's been a full participant and has no game designation. CeeDee Lamb missed the first two days of practice this week due to an illness, but returned Friday as a full participant and carries no injury designation. With Bland ruled out, it'll be interesting to see if Trevon Diggs plays this weekend after being limited throughout the week. Meanwhile, Quinnen Williams was a full participant, so he seems to be progressing through concussion protocol well. Kansas City Chiefs (-3) at Tennessee Titans\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusChiefsLeo ChenalLBShoulderOutTrent McDuffieCBKneeOutJaylon MooreOTKneeOutRashee RiceWRConcussionOutJawaan TaylorOTElbowOutTyquan ThorntonWRConcussionOutJake BriningstoolTEHamstringOutNazeeh JohnsonCBShoulderOutDerrick NnadiDTIllnessOutTitansBryce OliverWRKneeOutOluwafemi OladejoLBFibulaOutCedric GrayLBConcussionOutJalyn Armour-DavisCBAchillesQuestionableAli GayeLBKneeQuestionableGunnar HelmTEToeQuestionableVan JeffersonWRBackQustionableArden KeyLBIllnessQuestionableKansas City is ruling out nine players for Week 18, including top wideout Rashee Rice. He was unable to practice this week due to a concussion. Meanwhile, the offensive line will continue to be thin with tackles Jawaan Taylor and Jaylon Moore both out as well. Tennessee will be monitoring the status of linebacker Arden Key, who appeared on the injury report on Friday due to an illness that held him out of practice and has him officially listed as questionable. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-3) at Carolina Panthers\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusBuccaneersN/AN/AN/AN/APanthersTershawn WhartonDTHamstringOutTrevin WallaceILBShoulderOutIkem EkwonuOTKneeQuestionableDavid MooreWRElbowQuestionableThe Buccaneers have a clear bill of health coming into Week 16, listing no players with a game designation. Left tackle Ikem Ekwonu was able to practice for the first time this week on Friday, which gives him a shot at suiting up on Sunday for Carolina. Rookie wideout Tetairoa McMillan (foot, ankle) did not practice on Wednesday, but was a full participant the past two days and carries no designation for Week 16. Minnesota Vikings (-2.5) at New York Giants\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusVikingsJavon HargraveDLThighOutRyan KellyCKneeQuestionableAustin KeysLBAnkleQuestionableBrian O'NeillOTHeelQuestionableGavin BartholomewTEBackQuestionableTy ChandlerRBKneeQuestionableGiantsBeaux CollinsWRConcussion, neckOutEvan NealOLNeck, hamstringOutRakeem Nunez-Roches Sr.DLAnkleOutKayvon ThibodeauxOLBShoulderOutJoshua EzeuduOLCalfQuestionableDemetrius Flannigan-FowlesLBIllnessQuestionableArt GreenCBIllness, hamstringQuestionableRico PaytonCBBackQuestionableThe Vikings announced that offensive tackle Christian Darrisaw (knee) has been placed on injured reserve. Justin Skule will start in his place at left tackle, according to head coach Kevin O'Connell. After logging a full practice on Wednesday, the Giants listed Evan Neal as a non-participant on back-to-back days and have since been ruled out. Neal has yet to play this season. Elsewhere, pass rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux will be sidelined after missing the entire week of practice with a shoulder injury. New York Jets at New Orleans Saints (-6)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusJetsKiko MauigoaLBNeckOutMason TaylorTENeckOutEric WattsDLConcussionOutJustin FieldsQBKneeQuestionableTyrod TaylorQBGroin, kneeQuestionableSaintsAlvin KamaraRBKnee, ankleOutAsim RichardsOTAnkleOutCesar RuizGAnkleOutNathan ShepherdDTAnkle, kneeQuestionableMason TiptonWRIllnessQuestionableZaire Mitchell-PadenTEKneeQuestionableNew York will start Brady Cook again at quarterback, but Fields and/or Taylor could be available in a backup/emergency role as they are both questionable. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor is out after not practicing this week. The Saints will once again be without Alvin Kamara as the veteran back has been ruled out with knee and ankle injuries. Kamara hasn't played since suffering an MCL sprain in Week 12. With Devin Neal on injured reserve, New Orleans' backfield is quite thin. Atlanta Falcons (-3) at Arizona Cardinals\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusFalconsKhaDarel HodgeWRShoulderOutMike HughesCBAnkleOutDrake LondonWRKneeQuestionableJames Pearce Jr.EDGEFootQuestionableBrandon DorlusDLIllness, shoulderQuestionableCardinalsMax MeltonCBHeelOutDarren HallCBConcussionOutParis Johnson Jr.OLKneeOutJalen ThompsonSHamstringOutEvan BrownOLPersonalOutL.J.

Head coach Raheem Morris told reporters that London, who missed the last four games with a PCL sprain in his knee, is fully expected to play. Marvin Harrison Jr. is trending towards playing, telling reporters on Friday that he's \"good enough to go.\" The second-year wideout missed two games with a heel injury. \nJacksonville Jaguars at Denver Broncos (-3.5)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusJaguarsBhayshul TutenRBFingerOutDanny StriggowDEAnkleOutJalen McLeodLBAnkleOutBroncosJustin StrnadILBFootOutKarene ReidILBHamstringQuestionableBen PowersGBicepsQuestionableTuten will be sidelined for the Jaguars on Sunday, and it's possible his absence could be longer. He did not practice at all this week due to his finger injury, which could mean even more carries for Travis Etienne Jr. out of the backfield. Both Powers and Reid practiced fully on Friday, so Denver is pretty healthy coming into Week 16 outside of Strnad, who missed all week. Pittsburgh Steelers at Detroit Lions (-7)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusSteelersT.J.

Seumalo and Pierre also did not practice at all this week and have subsequently been ruled out. Joseph couldn't get on the field with the Lions this week and has since been ruled out. Decker and Glasgow are two linemen to monitor heading into the weekend, as neither was able to practice on Friday. Las Vegas Raiders at Houston Texans (-14)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusRaidersKolton MillerOLAnkleOutJordan MeredithOLAnkleQuestionableTexansAzeez Al-ShaairLBAnkle, kneeQuestionableChristian KirkWRIllnessQuestionableWoody MarksRBAnkleQuestionableDerek Stingley Jr.CBOlbiqueQuestionableNick ChubbRBRibsQuestionableJake HansenLBChestQuestionableJustin WatsonWRCalfQuestionableHead coach Pete Carroll said Friday that Geno Smith is good to go this week and will starter after missing last week with right shoulder and back injuries. He practiced fully throughout the week. Meanwhile, Maxx Crosby also carries no injury designation after practicing fully on Friday despite a knee injury.Houston's backfield is worth monitoring with both Woody Marks and Nick Chubb listed as questionable. Both were able to practice, however, with Chubb listed as a full participant while Marks was limited. Star corner Derek Stingley Jr. returned to practice on a limited basis on Friday after missing both Wednesday and Thursday due to an oblique injury. New England Patriots at Baltimore Ravens (-3)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusPatriotsRobert SpillaneLBAnkleOutChristian BarmoreDTKneeQuestionableCarlton Davis IIICBHipQuestionableMarcus JonesCBKneeQuestionableHarold LandryLBKneeQuestionableRavensTeddye BuchananLBKneeOutJay Higgins IVLBKneeOutChidobe AwuzieCBFootDoubtfulKyle HamiltonSAnkleQuestionableJohn JenkinsDTIllnessQuestionableRonnie StanleyOTKnee, ankleQuestionableNew England's defense could have a serious dent put into it this weekend, particularly if a number of key questionable players are unable to go. Christian Barmore seemed to be the most at risk of not playing after not participating on Friday. Every other questionable Patriot practiced on a limited basis to end the week. \nAfter not practicing on Wednesday, Lamar Jackson participated fully on both Thursday and Friday, and carries no designation for Week 16. Maybe the most intriguing aspect of Baltimore's injury report, however, is Kyle Hamilton, who is questionable after popping up on the report on Friday as a limited participant with an ankle injury. San Francisco 49ers (-5.5) at Indianapolis Colts (Monday)\nTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatus49ersColtsAnalysis to come.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If all you want for Christmas this holiday weekend is your two front teeth an incredible college basketball slate, then boy do I have some news for you: Santa (spoiler alert!) picked you for his nice list. Because Saturday presents an incredible day of action on the hardwood headlined by the annual CBS Sports Classic in Atlanta, which features ranked teams in each matchup and opportunities for both Kentucky and Ohio State to prove themselves after recent stumbles.Throughout the day and into the night, 12 ranked teams are in action Saturday -- among them No. 22 St. John's and No. 12 North Carolina -- and there are three ranked-vs.-ranked matchups to boot. One of those is perhaps the game of the day on CBS at 5:30 p.m. ET between No. 8 Houston and No. 14 Arkansas. But we also have No. 6 Purdue vs. No. 21 Auburn and No. 3 Duke vs. No. 19 Texas Tech as part of the nightcap. And for those who are staying up late No. 1 Arizona tips at 11:30 p.m. ET (!!) vs. San Diego State.Like I said: a loaded slate.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Where Kentucky, North Carolina stand before CBS Sports Classic; conference champions projected\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe college basketball experts made picks straight up and against the spread for some of the biggest games of the day Saturday. Those picks are below.            Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook | All times ET                                 No. 22 St. John's vs. Kentucky        \n12:30 p.m. on CBS, CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium: Rick Pitino is 1-0 this season facing teams he previously coached (St. John's beat Iona 91-64 last week) and I anticipate that record moves to 2-0 Saturday. This Kentucky team has looked listless on offense for most of the last month, and the Johnnies are starting to figure things out defensively at an opportune time. This St. John's team has whiffed on most of its chances to score a signature win out of the gate — it is 0-3 vs. ranked teams so far — but the worm turns vs. the Wildcats here.

UNC is 3-0 vs. the Buckeyes in the CBS Sports Classic and it has played very well vs. high-major opponents thus far with wins over Kansas, Kentucky and Georgetown on its resume. The length and defense from the Tar Heels gets them the win.

That's not to say Houston's not the real deal as well — I think Houston wins this game — but if I were to play it it'd be by taking the points with the Razorbacks. They have a tremendous defense, they're getting great guard play from their backcourt and they have the personnel to match, or at least potentially keep up with, the physicality Houston will bring into this one.

Auburn nearly downed Houston in November and has notched wins over St. John's and NC State in the last few weeks as it gains confidence in its personnel under first-year coach Steven Pearl. Tigers can score almost as well as any team in the country — but Purdue is not among them.

I'm also a staunch JT Toppin stan and think that matchup with Cameron Boozer could be terrific. That said, this Duke team is operating at another level right now: its defense is No. 10 defending 3-pointers, No. 2 by 2-point percentage and No. 1 accounting for effective field-goal percentage. A win would be a heavy lift for a Tech team that has been good, not great, on offense so far even with the star turn of Christian Anderson. I'm taking the points with the dog but Duke wins this one by multiple possessions.

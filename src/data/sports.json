    "body": "\n        We're at the point of the college football season where teams are who they are. Sure, there are rare cases where you see mediocre teams level up, or great teams fall apart, but for the most part, we know who's who in the zoo.That team that's struggled to block all year? Yeah, they're probably not going to figure it out this week. The quarterback who has struggled against the blitz? He will continue to struggle against the blitz.You can bet college football games this week at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.Â Claim your offer here:In theory, it makes it easier to figure out how matchups will play out. In reality, the folks setting the lines know all of this stuff, too. Still, there are a few games this week on the board I'm feeling confident about, which isn't something I've been able to say much this season. I mean, the results in this column speak for themselves.\nGames of the Week\nNo. 8 Ole Miss at No. 13 Oklahoma: When you think of Ole Miss' offense, you don't typically think of the team's rushing attack first because Lane Kiffin and company have done such a great job of scheming explosive plays in the passing attack during their tenure. This season has been no exception. The Rebels' offense ranks 19th nationally in explosive pass rate. The rushing attack ranks 77th in explosive rate, but while it's not ripping off huge chunks, it's been something the Rebels have routinely relied on to move the ball.In their first six games, all of which were wins, Ole Miss averaged 204 rushing yards per game. Last week, Georgia took it away. Ole Miss rushed for 88 yards and only 3.7 yards per carry. It lost. Now, some of that was Ole Miss not throwing often, but when you look under the hood, it's not difficult to see that the Rebels' worst games have all come when they had their lowest EPA per rush efforts.This week, they're facing an Oklahoma defense that ranks fifth nationally in EPA per rush allowed and second in success rate against the run. Honestly, Oklahoma's defense is great at everything. It's much better than the Georgia unit Ole Miss faced last week, and being at home, I suspect the Oklahoma defense will do a better job of slowing Ole Miss down than any other team. The fact that this is Ole Miss' second consecutive road game won't help matters for the Rebels, either.\nOffensively, Oklahoma has not been nearly as impressive. Essentially, the Sooners' offense is \"Mateer or bust.\" He either makes it happen or he doesn't. This feels like a matchup where Mateer can make it happen enough to get the Sooners what they need, and it also feels like a game where Oklahoma's defense can earn the offense some short field opportunities. For all the Sooners' struggles on offense, when they get in scoring range, they finish drives in the end zone frequently. The Pick: Oklahoma -4.5 (-115) at Fanduel\nNo. 3 Texas A&M at No. 20 LSU: Earlier, when I wrote about a team that hasn't been able to block anybody all season, and won't learn how to block, LSU was most definitely a team I had in mind. When LSU's offense got off to a slow start to the season, there were plenty of available excuses. They began the year on the road against Clemson and were replacing four starters on the offensive line. You figured that as the competition eased a bit and those guys gained experience, they'd figure it out.Even if we remove Clemson from the equation, LSU's offensive line hasn't figured out anything other than how to let a defender get past them in new and sometimes exciting ways. Garrett Nussmeier has been under fire all season long and looks like a soldier who has been at war for too long. Now the Tigers are facing yet another excellent defense in A&M, and I don't think being at home in Tiger Stadium at night will be enough to overcome the reality of the situation.\nDefensively, the Tigers are good enough to keep them in games, but at some point, the dam will burst. It would not surprise me if that point was this weekend, because this is an Aggies offense that's not easy to deal with. They aren't truly elite at anything, but they're good at everything, and those teams are tough to stop. You look to take one thing away, and they just do the other thing.These are the things you can do when you have a good offensive line, and A&M's is one of the best in the country. Marcel Reed has taken steps forward as a passer, but a big reason why is that he rarely finds himself under duress while in the pocket. The few times he is, he's able to escape because he's one of the best scramblers in the country. And that's another thing that will break a defense's will. When you do everything right to get the stop and then the QB just takes off and picks up the first down, it's mentally deflating.I would never rule out LSU at home. It's certainly possible the Tigers' defense can force a bunch of turnovers and make this game a rock fight that allows the offense to squeeze just enough points to win, but that outcome isn't nearly as likely as the Aggies winning. The Pick: Texas A&M -2.5 (-115) at DraftKings\nLock of the Week\nNo. 11 BYU at Iowa State: Iowa State comes into this game on a two-game losing streak, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise. It's hard to win games when you suffer as many injuries as this team has on both defense and special teams. If you didn't know, the Cyclones have spent games without a kicker in recent weeks, and they've lost multiple cornerbacks to injury. Last year, this team dealt with injuries to every linebacker within 100 square miles of Ames, Iowa, but was able to overcome them.Well, no shade to linebackers, but in this era of football, it's easier to scheme around your linebackers than it is your corners.What's truly concerning about this matchup in particular is what happened a couple of games ago. Iowa State gave up 260 yards on the ground against Cincinnati in a 38-30 loss. While they aren't exactly the same, there are a lot of similarities between the Bearcats' offense and the BYU offense the Clones will face here.\nBYU ranks sixth nationally in EPA per rush and ninth in explosive rush rate. They also run the ball a lot, as their 60.8% rush rate is the ninth-highest rate in the country. I expect the Cougars will find success running the ball here, even if I do worry about a possible letdown coming off last week's Holy War win against Utah. The Pick: BYU +3 (-112) at DraftKingsOver of the Week\nBaylor at No. 21 Cincinnati: I'm not sure there's a more slept-on team in the country right now than the Cincinnati Bearcats. Like BYU, they're undefeated in the Big 12, and if not for one bad decision by Brendan Sorsby late in the season-opener against Nebraska, the Bearcats might be undefeated period. Well, Sorsby hasn't made a mistake since and is putting up exceptional numbers that nobody is paying attention to.My thought here is that Cincinnati's offensive prowess will once again be on display against Baylor because everybody's offensive prowess is on display against Baylor. You know that Auburn offense that hasn't cracked 20 points in SEC play this season? It put up 38 against Baylor! The only team Baylor has held below 27 points this season is Samford. FBS opponents are averaging 35.5 points per game against the Bears.\nThe Bears' only defense is their offense. It's not as explosive or efficient as Cincinnati's has been, but that's mostly because the Bears don't run the ball as effectively. They throw it pretty dang well, and Cincinnati's defense ranks 103rd nationally in EPA per dropback. The Pick: Over 66.5 (-115) at DraftKingsMACtion of the Week\nUMass at Central Michigan: Sometimes it's as simple as finding the worst team in the world and betting against them. Perhaps UMass isn't the worst team in the world, but it's the worst team in the FBS, and I can't help but wonder about its mental state right now. Last week, the Minutemen held a 21-20 lead over Buffalo in the fourth quarter but missed a field goal that would've given them a 24-20 lead. They recovered by getting an interception with 59 seconds left in the game.The first win of the season was so close they could taste it. The Minutemen were then hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that put them in second-and-20. The next thing you knew, it was fourth-and-24 at the UMass 5-yard line, and only 10 seconds had come off the clock. You know what happened next. They punted, and the Bulls went 50 yards in 20 seconds for the game-winning touchdown.\nCan UMass get off the mat after that? I don't know. Even if they do, I don't know if they can hang with the Chippewas, who look like one of the better teams in the MAC this season. The Pick: Central Michigan -15.5 (-115) at FanduelUpset of the Week\nBall State at Northern Illinois: Let's stay in the MAC a little longer so we can fade a favorite that hasn't done a whole lot to deserve being favored this year. It's one thing when a MAC team struggles in nonconference play, because they're often playing much stronger programs. For instance, Miami (Ohio) started the season with losses to Wisconsin, Rutgers and UNLV, getting outscored 103-55, but they're 3-0 in MAC play and have outscored opponents 89-51.One of those opponents was Northern Illinois, which started the season slowly and has continued moving slowly. The Huskies are winless in MAC play, including a loss to an Eastern Michigan squad that hasn't looked very good itself. Yes, they're home here, but if you were to ask the Huskies what the one thing they do well is, I don't know that they'd have an answer for you. It used to be running the football, but they've been worse in the MAC than they were coming in! Don't get me wrong. I don't look at Ball State as some kind of juggernaut being slept on, but that's an awfully big price on the Cardinals considering how Northern Illinois has looked all season. After all, the Cardinals beat the Ohio team that beat Northern by 27 last week. The Pick: Ball State (+185) at DraftKings\nBetsLast WeekSeasonUnitsGames of the Week2-08-8-1.75Lock of the Week1-02-6-4.61Upset of the Week0-11-7-5.07Overall3-322-26-7.25SportsLine's proven computer model has simulated every Week 9 college football game 10,000 times.Â Visit SportsLine now to see all the picks, all from the model that is 42-30 since the beginning of last season on top-rated money-line and over/under picks.Â \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Say this about the first three nights of the 2025-26 NBA season: It absolutely sucks that a federal gambling probe seemingly fell out of the sky to overshadow what has been one of the most electric starts to a season you could possibly imagine.Â First the Rockets and Thunder go to double-overtime on Tuesday. Then the Pacers take the Thunder, again, to double-overtime on Thursday. OKC, thanks to some incredible defense against Houston and a career-high 55 points from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at Indiana, escaped both with a win, and both times it was the Golden State Warriors waiting on the back end on of the national TV schedule for 12 quarters of OKC basketball to finish.Â On opening night, the Warriors discarded the Lakers despite 43 points from Luka DonÄiÄ. On Thursday, they backed that up with a 137-131 overtime victory over the Denver Nuggets, who were led by Aaron Gordon's unbelievable 50-point performance.Â Gordon, a career 33% 3-point shooter who came out of nowhere to shoot 44% last season, showed that it might not have been an anomaly as he canned 10 of his 11 triples and 17 of 21 field goals overall. How on earth could the Nuggets have lost a game in which Gordon, Nikola JokiÄ and Jamal Murray combined for 96 points?Â \nI'll tell you how. His name is Stephen Curry.Â If you're looking for signs that Curry has fallen off, even slightly, in his 17th season at 37 years old, you better get out one hell of a high-powered microscope. The guy went for 42 points, 35 of which came in the second half and overtime, with six 3-pointers, single-handedly lifting Golden State with 16 straight points over a six-minute run spanning the end of the fourth quarter and the start of overtime.Â From the 2:42 mark of the fourth quarter, Curry outscored the Nuggets, 18-15, all by himself. Multiple times the Nuggets looked like they were about to put the game on ice, and Curry just wouldn't let it happen. With under two minutes to play in regulation and the Warriors down three, he did this:\nWith 25 seconds left and the Warriors again down three, he did this:\nHe started overtime with another 3, and sealed the deal with a bucket and a pair of free throws in the closing 25 seconds of overtime to push the Warriors to 2-0 with the sort of \"what the hell did I just watch?\" performance that only he can pull off.Â \nWhat's crazy is Curry only had seven points at halftime. Even at this advanced stage of a career that continues on an upward trend toward one of the five best in history, he can still go from zero to 100 faster that any player probably ever. Still, at 37 years old, it feels like he can wake up from a nap and hit the nuclear button whenever he wants. He tossed in seven assists, six rebounds and three steals for fun.Â \nSeriously, Curry has not lost one mph on his fastball. If anything, he's actually better now than ever. Maybe not quite as shifty, but still among the shiftiest players alive with his handle and ability to leverage the threat of his shot into downhill advantages, where he's as strong as he's ever been in terms of finishing through contact.Â And the shooting? Obviously that's still there. As is his seemingly endless supply of energy to stay on the move with an entire defense chasing him for as long as it takes to get a shot, and ultimately, a win. This guy is out of this world. I know I'm not breaking any news with that statement, but good grief. What an absolute treat it is to still be watching him do his this after all these years, and also to know that he's far from done.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's talent is not in question, but his methods are the subject of furious debate. His first two games of the 2025-26 season will do nothing to change that. On Thursday night, the reigning MVP showed exactly why he's the most frustrating player in the league to guard.Gilgeous-Alexander poured in a career-high 55 points in the Thunder's 141-135 double-overtime win over the Indiana Pacers -- the Thunder are the first team in NBA history to go to double-overtime in each of their first two games of a season -- on 15 of 31 from the field and 23 of 26 from the free throw line. He also added eight rebounds and five assists.Â His 55 points on Thursday were the third-most by a Thunder player since the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, and he's already up to 90 points for the season. Only Wilt Chamberlain, Anthony Davis and Michael Jordan have scored more in the first two games of a season in NBA history.Â \nGilgeous-Alexander is also already 33 of 40 from the free throw line. His 23 makes and 26 attempts against the Pacers were both career-highs, and his 40 attempts are the most by a player in the first two games of a season in NBA history. He obviously won't average 20 free throws over the course of the season, but he already has a massive lead in that department and is once again on pace to be among the league leaders.Â \nSince Gilgeous-Alexander emerged as an All-Star during the 2022-23 season, he has finished third, second and second in total free throw attempts over the last three seasons. During that time, only Giannis Antetokounmpo (2,261) has shot more free throws than Gilgeous-Alexander (2,057). No one else even had 1,700.Â Free throw attempts from 2022-23 to 2024-25 seasonPlayerFTAGiannis Antetokounmpo2,261Shai Gilgeous-Alexander2,057Luka DonÄiÄ1,697Trae Young1,607DeMar DeRozan1,576Jayson Tatum1,559At times, the discussion about Gilgeous-Alexander's ability to get to the line can go too far and overshadow his unique gifts as a scorer and athlete. Thursday night's showing, however, was a reminder of why it keeps coming up.Â It's not just that Gilgeous-Alexander shoots so many free throws -- it's how he gets to the line. Whereas Antetokounmpo bullies his way there with brute strength, Gilgeous-Alexander is a trickster. He fools defenders (and occasionally officials) with an array of hesitations, fakes and pivots.Â No player makes opponents shake their heads or raise their arms in dismay more often than Gilgeous-Alexander. The Pacers spent seven consecutive games guarding him in the Finals just a few months ago, and even they couldn't help but be deceived.Â Here's a sampling from Thursday. Aside from the third clip, perhaps, all of these are clear fouls. But that doesn't make them any less frustrating for the Pacers.Â \nJust look at Jarace Walker's face after the one in overtime.Â Jarace Walker wishing he hadn't bit on a Gilgeous-Alexander pump fake Nothing sums up the experience of trying to defend Gilgeous-Alexander better than that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill had his season come to an abrupt halt in Week 4 when the eight-time Pro Bowl pass-catcher suffered a devastating knee injury in the win over the New York Jets. Hill dislocated his knee, and tore multiple ligaments, including his ACL.Â When Hill was loaded onto the cart and driven off the field, he was seen clapping his hands and smiling. Hill waved to the crowd and blew kisses to fans as well. It was an odd reaction after a painful, season-ending injury, but there was a reason behind it.Â During a recent appearance on Terron Armstead's podcast, \"The Set,\" Hill said that after he realized his leg was \"crooked,\" he immediately felt grateful for all the incredible moments football has given him, and thought about the time he would now have to spend with his family.Â \"So I immediately started laughing man, because I feel like I've been able to play this game my whole entire life, and I've been blessed with great talents and great gifts, and the amount of support that I get from my family is amazing, man,\" Hill said. \"I really wasn't even thinking about the injury. I was just thinking about the great times I've had playing this game and just me being in Miami. It all came full circle. I know this (wasn't) it, but I was just happy bro. Because I'm always trying to find the good in everything. I get time to think about my kids, I get time to travel, I get time to like really sit down and enjoy my life and not always train.\"\nHill said his entire life has been about training, living in the gym, on the track, on the jugs machine. He wasn't sacrificing his time for his family or other things he wanted to do. Now, he has this opportunity to get close to his kids, go to church on Sundays and improve the man he is off the field.Anytime a 31-year-old speedster suffers an injury like the one Hill did, it's fair to wonder if his football career could be over. Armstead asked what Hill's response is to the doubters out there, and he had a pretty surprising yet honest answer. Â \"Well, at the end of the day, I feel like that decision is all based upon how I feel and where my mindset is at the moment,\" Hill said. \"Like right now, I'm happy. I'm happy with being with my kids, I'm happy with the career that I've had. I love playing football. I love it, but it takes a lot. It takes a lot to be the best and to stay at the top and make a lot of money and help your team win games and stuff like that. It takes a lot. It takes a lot on you mentally, it takes a lot on you physically. I'm at the point now where I need to have a conversation with mom, family, everybody ... I don't want to make any rash decisions, obviously. I just want to be in the moment.\"\nHill says rehab is going well and he's attacking every day. Following the injury, Hill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said that the goal is to be ready for Week 1 in 2026. When or if Hill returns, it likely won't be with the Dolphins.Â CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reportedÂ that the Dolphins are expected to release Hill prior to the start of the new league year in March. Hill has $29.9 million in non-guaranteed base salary on the books next year, but $16 million is guaranteed on the third day of the new league year, March 14, 2026.Â If Hill's football career is over, it was one remarkable ride. \"Cheetah\" was the fastest receiver of his time. He won a Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs, was named a First Team All-Pro five times and led the NFL in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns in 2023.

Williamson was the crew chief for that game, a 20-10 win for the Bulldogs, which featured a number of questionable calls.CBS Sports' John Talty reached out to the league for comment, but was told the SEC \"does not comment on personnel matters\". CBS Sports can confirm that Williamson did not officiate last week, but the rest of his assigned crew did -- and will not officiate another game for the rest of the season for the league.Â Williamson and his crew took center stage for all the wrong reasons in the Auburn vs. Georgia game. Late in the first half, with Auburn leading 10-0, quarterback Jackson Arnold appeared to score before the ball was knocked out of his hands on the goal line. However, officials ruled it a fumble on the field, and the call was upheld despite replay appearing to show Arnold breaking the plane with possession.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Bulldogs led 13-10 when Kirby Smart ran up to the side judge and appeared to call a timeout. Once the clock was blown dead, Smart argued he was telling he official that Auburn defenders were clapping in an attempt to create a false start for the offense. The broadcast replay showed Smart making what looked like a timeout signal with his hands, but he and the Bulldogs were allowed to keep the timeout anyway.\nAuburn coach Hugh Freeze and Arnold both downplayed the controversial calls' effect on the game, but the seven-point swing was an obvious turning point in the contest.Â \n            \n    ",

NFL player props figure to center on the passing games, with both teams dealing with injuries to their running backs, and there's no shortage of quality receivers to use in 'Thursday Night Football' props. Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston all had at least 67 yards or a touchdown on Sunday. Justin Herbert, who leads the league with 1,913 passing yards has a passing touchdown prop bar of 1.5, which is the same as Carson Wentz, who continues to start in place of J.J. McCarthy (ankle)The NFL prop odds, however, differ for the quarterbacks in regard to passing touchdowns. Herbert is at -164 to hit the Over, while Wentz having multiple touchdown passes would return a payout of +102 Meanwhile, Aaron Jones is active after missing the last four games and has a rushing bar of 27.5 yards.

Through four starts, Wentz is averaging 268 passing yards, which is fourth-most in the NFL. He has a pair of 300-plus passing yard games over his last three starts as Minnesota is leaning on him rather than a run game without Aaron Jones. Wentz has averaged 40.7 pass attempts over the last three games, and for comparison, Herbert, who leads the NFL in pass attempts in 2025, is averaging 38.7 attempts on the season.Los Angeles just allowed a season-high in passing yards on Sunday, giving up 288 to Daniel Jones. The Chargers' defense gets a little lax at home, as it's given up 70.3 more passing yards at SoFi Stadium than in road games, and that doesn't even take into account the Chargers allowing 249 passing yards in the Brazil contest.

    "body": "\n        We've now seen all 30 NBA teams play at least one game. The Thunder and Warriors have gone twice. Does that mean we can say anything meaningful about the 2025-26 season? Maybe. Maybe not. Last year, the Hornets beat the Rockets on the road. Charlotte wasn't the surprise No. 2 seed among those teams. Both of the Tuesday matchups were won by teams that would eventually lose to those same opponents in the playoffs -- the Lakers to the Timberwolves and the Celtics to the Knicks. Again, not exactly predictive. But there were at least a few games that gave us meaningful insight.The Cleveland Cavaliers dropped 136 points in a 30-point decimation of the Toronto Raptors, for instance. They had the best offense in the league across a 64-win season while the Raptors tanked. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander beat Nikola JokiÄ on the road and then took his MVP award. Opening night is the first real opportunity for players and teams to show the world what they spent the summer working toward. Sometimes it takes a while, as it did for the Rockets. Sometimes it's immediate, as it was for the Cavaliers.We have a whole season to offer measured takes on reliable samples. Opening night is for overreactions. So let's go through each of these games in search of one extreme takeaway. Will any of these pan out? Well, if last year is any indication, some of them will, and others will look ridiculous. This is the NBA. It's an ever-changing league, and it's better to be too early on these changes than too late.NBA opening night overreactionsNuggets-Warriors: Nikola JokiÄ will have his first All-Star teammateIt was a Twilight Zone sort of night for the Nuggets. They made it to overtime despite losing JokiÄ's minutes. Aaron Gordon chipped in 50 points, but Denver lost because JokiÄ had a miserable shooting night. Still ... Aaron Gordon scored 50 points, and he did so on a career-best 10 3-pointers. He was a 29% 3-point shooter as recently as two years ago, but after making 43.6% of his triples last season, it's fair to be optimistic that Thursday's shooting is at least somewhat sustainable.\nMeanwhile, Jamal Murray scored 25 points on 11-of-20 shooting. That might not sound especially notable, except that for his career, Murray has averaged only 10.5 points in season openers. He's a notoriously slow starter, especially lately because of injuries. But if Murray is healthy and Gordon is making 3s, the Nuggets won't need JokiÄ to be Superman every night. If Thursday was any indication, they'll be able to carry enough of the load to not only keep him fresher throughout the season, but also give him the first All-Star teammate(s) of his career.Pacers-Thunder: Bennedict Mathurin is the Most Improved Player favoriteBennedict Mathurin was drafted into pretty unusual circumstances. He immediately joined a team that had just acquired its franchise player. That franchise player plays a specific sort of basketball, and his team rose to prominence in part by surrounding him with teammates who fit that style. It was an awkward fit. Mathurin needs the ball in his hands to thrive. He's an athletic, slashing scorer, one that sometimes stood out on the freewheeling Pacers for his shot-selection and ball-dominance.But with Tyrese Haliburton injured, the Pacers don't have any choice but to put the ball in Mathurin's hands, and in his first game as one of Indiana's primary scorers, he soared, scoring 36 points against the best defense in the league. Last season, the only two players to do that against the Thunder were Fred VanVleet and Stephen Curry, both of whom did so on at least five made 3-pointers. Mathurin did it by barreling towards the basket, drawing 17 free-throw attempts in what was almost one of the best season-opening victories in Pacers history. They may have lost the game, but if this is Mathurin taking that crucial next step, they'll wind up winning the war. He flashed star upside on Thursday, and he'll have 81 more chances to show voters he deserves a trophy for it.\nMavericks-Spurs: Victor Wembanyama is the best player in the worldLook past the numbers for a moment. I know that's going to be difficult on a night in which Wembanyama scored 40 points, pulled in 15 rebounds, blocked three shots and made over 70% of his shots, but his stat lines are always gaudy.What we saw on Wednesday was different.This was no longer a baby bird spreading its wings. This was a dragon laying waste to any who would dare oppose him. The entire theory of the Dallas Mavericks was to build a team so gigantic that nobody could score against it. Wembanyama made it look easy. How many 7-5 centers have you ever seen pump fake into a drive that ended in a reverse dunk? How about blocking an opposing center on one end and then crossing him up for a four-point play on the other?\nHe's running the floor like a small forward now, but he's added enough bulk to bully centers. When Anthony Davis is so lost against you that he has no option but to foul, you know you're doing something right. Maybe Nikola JokiÄ is still more valuable. Maybe Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hoists the trophy again at the end. But Victor Wembanyama's season 3 premiere made the impossible look routine. No one else on Earth can do what he does. If he isn't the best player in the NBA today, he will be in the very near future.\nTimberwolves-Trail Blazers: Minnesota is still light on playmakingYes, the Timberwolves won, and yes, Anthony Edwards was spectacular with 41 points, but this game was closer than the Timberwolves likely suspected in part because this team remains light on playmaking. They assisted on only half of their 42 field goals and committed 19 turnovers. With Donte DiVincenzo replacing Mike Conley in the starting lineup and Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr. expected to take on bigger roles this season, the Timberwolves are seemingly moving away from traditional point guards. Yes, 41 points from Edwards are nice. He's capable of playing hero. But given the construction of this roster, the Timberwolves need more than one assist out of Edwards if they're going to get by the many Western Conference teams that are better than the Blazers.Kings-Suns: Signing Russell Westbrook was a mistakeIt's a bit cliche to blame Russell Westbrook, especially after a single game. The problem here is less what he did on the court, though a 2-of-8 shooting night in 19 minutes was hardly encouraging. The issue here is what he does to Sacramento's roster. He got on the floor before Keon Ellis, the only reliable defender the Kings have, and that in turn limited Ellis to only 13 minutes. Meanwhile, the Kings closed their loss to the Suns with Dylan Caldwell, a two-way player, at center. Westbrook's slot on the team probably should have gone to a defensive-minded big man. The roster is enormously unbalanced. They have too many players who need the ball and not enough frontcourt players to do the dirty work. Westbrook's reputation affords him playing time that this specific roster needs to be spending elsewhere.Â Clippers-Jazz: The Clippers are too oldThe Clippers built the oldest roster in NBA history this offseason, and they likely felt justified in doing so because of how well their older players fared a year ago. James Harden was an All-Star and Kawhi Leonard looked like his peak self down the stretch, so they added Chris Paul, Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez to their basketball remake of The Expendables. Well, what happened when they tipped off on Wednesday? They were run off the floor by the younger, more athletic Jazz.\nThe Clippers scored just eight fast break points in defeat, and the starting trio of Leonard, Beal and Harden combined for only 30 points. Aside from Derrick Jones Jr., there isn't much athleticism to speak of here. The Clippers need to out-execute opponents largely on skill, and if there is any slippage whatsoever from where those players were a year ago, that's going to be very tough. They came out completely flat on opening night, and if that's a sign of where they are physically now, things are only going to get harder in the dog days of the schedule.Bulls-Pistons: Detroit doesn't have enough shootingMalik Beasley, as a reserve, was responsible for more than 30% of Detroit's made 3-pointers last season. To put that number into perspective, Stephen Curry was responsible for around 32% of Golden State's 3-pointers in 2021, the year he played without Klay Thompson. The Pistons hoped that Duncan Robinson would be enough to replace his shooting, but Robinson hasn't made 40% of his 3s since 2021 and he missed all five of his attempts on Wednesday. Robinson is virtually unplayable when his shots don't go in, but the Pistons have no choice.Considering how much they have invested in Ausar Thompson and Jalen Duren, who are non-shooters, they need Robinson to space the floor properly. They got the worst of both worlds on Wednesday, as Robinson did little for their offense while suffering defensively. Meanwhile, Cade Cunningham spent the game driving into traffic en route to an 8-of-24 shooting performance. The Pistons are at least one shooter short right now, but given how historic Beasley was a year ago, even that might not be enough to lift this offense.\nGrizzlies-Pelicans: Ja Morant will return to the All-Star GameJa Morant more or less lost the 2023-24 season to injuries and suspension. He was back on the court last season, but injuries continued to weaken him, and so did a revamped offense that all but removed the pick-and-roll. His 11.4 paint points per game and 6.4 free throw attempts per game both represented meaningful dips from his 2022 peak, when he made his first All-Star Game. But with Tuomas Iisalo now locked in as head coach and an offseason of recovery behind him, Morant put up 20 paint points and eight free-throw attempts against the Pelicans on Wednesday, en route to 35 points on the night.\nEverything Morant does offensively flows out of his ability to get to the basket and get to the line, and Iisalo has reconfigured the offense to maximize his opportunities to do so. This version of Morant is an All-Star, and if he can play like this when half of his team is injured, he'll only get stronger as the season progresses.Bucks-Wizards: Khris Middleton is back!The Bucks are ineligible for any overreactions by virtue of having played the Wizards. We're not even going to pretend to take anything away from their opening performance. But a former Buck that was on the other side Wednesday? That's fair game. Can you guess the last time Khris Middleton scored 23 points in an NBA game? I'm almost certain you can't, because it wasn't even last season. No, it was Game 4 of Milwaukee's five-game loss to Indiana in the 2024 postseason.\n\n        \n            \n                Khris Middleton shows love to Bucks fans in return to Milwaukee: 'I think that's every player's dream'\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA variety of injuries tore Middleton down to the point that he was essentially just salary filler in the Kyle Kuzma trade last February. But Middleton looked healthier than he has in quite some time with his 9-of-14 shooting performance against the Bucks on Wednesday. He can't get to the rim like he used to, but he looked comfortable finding his patented mid-range looks against the Bucks, and if that persists, he immediately becomes a pretty interesting trade or buyout candidate come midseason.Hawks-Raptors: Toronto can build a viable offense without shootingThe 2024-25 Toronto Raptors never scored more than 133 points in a game. They scored 138 on opening night this season, and here's the kicker: They only shot 7-of-25 from 3-point range. This is Toronto in a nutshell. Dating back to the Nick Nurse years, they always lagged behind in shooting and playmaking, but made up for it by getting to the basket and scoring in transition. The Raptors had 34 fastbreak points on Wednesday to go along with 86 points in the paint. This is a weird group of players, and one that will probably need some mixing and matching from a lineup perspective. But they're big, athletic, and relentless defensively. They'll generate enough easy offense on that alone to survive, even if the shooting never quite comes around.76ers-Celtics: Philadelphia belongs to the guards nowJoel Embiid played 20 minutes, scored four points against arguably the NBA's thinnest front court and ultimately got benched for crunch time. His movement looked completely compromised. It should be panic time in Philadelphia, except VJ Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey just announced themselves as perhaps the most unguardable backcourt in the NBA.\n\n        \n            \n                Joel Embiid looks like a shell of himself during 20 painful minutes in 76ers' season-opening win vs. Celtics\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe pair combined to make 12 3-pointers on the way to their 74 points, and that shooting makes their elite speed that much more lethal. Philadelphia's big man may be slow and relatively unathletic at this stage of his career, but the 76ers can build a new identity around their backcourt's skill and dynamism. A star was born in Edgecombe on Wednesday, and Maxey reaffirmed that status for himself after an injury-plagued tanking year.Knicks-Cavaliers: Mike Brown and Leon Rose fixed the benchIf Tom Thibodeau had his way, his teams would rely on only five players. Maybe four. Luol Deng can play two positions at once, right? Mike Brown was hired in part to make the most of a bench built with limited resources, and he did just that in their 119-111 win against Cleveland. The Knicks used 11 players against the Cavaliers on Wednesday, and with Mitchell Robinson and Josh Hart injured, that meant every player with a standard contract except PacÃ´me Dadiet and Mohamed Diawara saw real action. The result? The Knicks got 35 points from their bench after averaging a league-low (by a country mile) 21.7 a year ago.\nEvery reserve except Landry Shamet had a positive plus-minus. Ariel Hukporti stood out starting in Robinson's place early on thanks to his energy and rebounding, but just about everyone did their part for the Knicks in their season-opening victory.\nMagic-Heat: Orlando will end its 13-year streak as a bottom-10 offenseDeath, taxes and bad Orlando offense. The Magic have ranked in the bottom 10 offensively 13 years in a row. That's what compelled their offseason blockbuster for Desmond Bane, and against a stout Miami defense, Bane absolutely delivered. His 23 points obviously helped, but really, just having a threatening shooter on the floor changed everything for this offense. After ranking 24th in the NBA with 45.8 paint points per game a season ago, the Magic dropped 56 on a Heat frontline led by star defender Bam Adebayo. If Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero can take the next step with this newfound space, the Magic won't just avoid the bottom-10, they might even sneak into the top 10.Hornets-Nets: Charlotte has its centersThe Hornets traded Mark Williams twice and Nick Richards once, and to the naked eye, it looked like they just didn't seek viable replacements. Well, it turns out, they've managed to fill the position for pennies on the dollar. Second-round rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner and former two-way player Moussa DiabatÃ© combined to give Charlotte 23 points, 20 rebounds and three blocks in their 136-117 win over the Nets. DiabatÃ© was a plus-minus darling on the defensive end a year ago, and Kalkbrenner won four consecutive Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards, so while they were pretty unheralded by typical NBA standards, the Hornets were justified in betting on them. That bet paid off on Wednesday. At least for now, they can roll forward with this duo.Thunder-Rockets: Alperen Sengun is an MVP candidateIt's been burbling all summer, especially at EuroBasket, where he drew comparisons to Nikola JokiÄ. Well, Tuesday was proof of concept. Alperen Sengun was for large stretches the best player on a court with Kevin Durant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, ultimately scoring 39 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in the Houston loss. He made a career-high five 3-pointers -- he'd previously topped out at three, and even that was a rarity. His finishing at the rim was a bit suspect last season, but he made four of his five restricted area shots against the Thunder. He led both teams with seven assists, no small feat considering he's playing on a roster with very little ball-handling or shooting.\n\n        \n            \n                Rockets haunted by glaring lack of point guard competence in season-opening defeat\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWe came into the season not knowing how Houston's offense would fare without Fred VanVleet. Tuesday gave us our answer: Through Sengun, and it's going to vault him into some very lofty conversations.Lakers-Warriors: Not even skinny Luka can fix this rosterHere's a distressing statistic: 97 of the 109 points scored by the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday were scored or assisted on by Luka DonÄiÄ or Austin Reaves. Not great. Neither is a home loss when your best player has a 43-point, 12-rebound, nine-assist stat line. The Lakers shot 8-of-32 from deep, distressing in percentage of course, but also in volume given how much JJ Redick has talked about hoisting 3s.\n        \n            \n                The Lakers keep making the same mistakes, but now the stakes are higher than ever for Rob Pelinka\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe perimeter defense was a mess, fouling Jimmy Butler constantly and doing little to impede Stephen Curry's movement. Deandre Ayton's debut was everything Blazers and Suns fans warned it could be. He demanded the ball too much, didn't get to the line, didn't rebound and didn't really mix it up near the basket much at all. Getting LeBron James back will help, but if the Lakers can't get the role players right, no amount of star power will matter.\n            ",

Earlier this week, the team had opened the 21-day practice window for the veteran.Jones only carried the ball for 46 yards on 13 carries in the opening two weeks this season. The running back also caught three passes for 44 yards, including a 27-yard touchdown reception against the Chicago Bears in Week 1.The Vikings signed Jones to a one-year contract during the 2024 offseason and Jones ended up rushing for a career-high 1,138 yards that season. Jones chose to remain with Minnesota as he signed a two-year, $20 million contract extension through the 2026 season.\nWhile Jones was on the shelf, the Vikings turned to former San Francisco 49ers running back Jordan Mason, who was acquired in an offseason trade. Mason has racked up 380 yards (4.5 yards per carry) and four touchdowns as the team's primary back. His best performance came in a 48-10 win against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3 when he rushed for 116 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n            \n    ",

It'll be Rodgers' first game against the team he enjoyed a significant amount of success with across 18 seasons.Â \"Feel so good about my time there because damn near everything great in my life is because of my football career,\" Rodgers said in a Zoom call with Packers reporters. \"And my football career starts, and will end one day, with Green Bay. So got a lot of love for all those memories.\"Rodgers has waxed poetically about the Packers in the lead up to Sunday night's prime time matchup between two first-place teams. He made it clear that he harbors no ill will towards Green Bay while stressing that Sunday \"is not a revenge game for me.\"\n        \n            \n                Aaron Rodgers: Steelers upcoming showdown vs. Packers is 'not a revenge game for me'\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nÂ \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" Rodgers said. \"I have a lot of great memories from my time there. There lot of great interactions with fans over the years. You know, living in Green Bay, living in Suamico, living in Hobart, going to Chives, being out and about, seeing people at the Piggly Wiggly and I'm shopping for groceries.\n\"I grew up there. I spent 18 years there, from (age) 21 to 39. So I'm thankful for my time there.\"Â In terms of ending his career with the Packers, Rodgers likely means from a ceremonial standpoint.Â It's become commonplace for accomplished athletes such as Rodgers to sign a one-day contract to retire with the team they enjoyed the bulk of their professional success with. It appears that Rodgers wants to end his career in a similar fashion.Â \nBefore that can happen, though, Rodgers has more football to play and more records to chase, like possibly becoming only the fifth quarterback in NFL history to defeat each of the NFL's 32 teams. He can do that by defeating his former team on Sunday night.Â \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In the Week 8 edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" the Los Angeles Chargers play host to the Minnesota Vikings.L.A. enters this game at 4-3 after dropping a wild game to the Colts last week, in which its defense got absolutely set in flames. The Chargers have now lost three of their last four since starting the season 3-0, and they're still dealing with a rash of injuries as they look to keep pace in the AFC West.You can bet Vikings vs. Chargers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Minnesota came out of its bye with a loss to the Eagles, dropping the Vikings back to .500 on the season. Two of their three wins have come against the Bengals and Browns, so they should be looking to prove that they can compete with actual competitive teams as they move into a considerably tougher stretch of schedule over the next two months.\nWhich of these two teams will bounce back and get into the win column? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Chargers vs. Vikings liveDate:Â Thursday, Oct. 23 |Â Time:Â 8:15 p.m. ETLocation:Â SoFi Stadium (Inglewood, California)Stream:Â Amazon PrimeFollow:Â CBS Sports AppOdds:Â Chargers -3, O/U 44.5 (viaÂ DraftKings Sportsbook)Bet NFL Week 8 games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.When the Vikings have the ballThe Vikings' passing game has, somewhat surprisingly, looked better withÂ Carson WentzÂ under center than it did withÂ J.J. McCarthy. Kevin O'Connell has been willing to pass the ball at a higher rate with Wentz in the lineup, and the backup QB has done a better job of both getting the ball out (his sack rate is less than half of McCarthy's) and getting it down the field to his pass-catchers than did the rookie during his early-season stint.Â \nWentz has had the advantage of having Jordan Addison in the lineup for three of his starts, while McCarthy didn't have him at all, and that's been of tremendous benefit to the offense. Addison has gone for 4-114-0, 5-41-1 and 9-128-0 in his three appearances, and he'd helped take advantage of the coverage rolled Justin Jefferson's way while also allowing more space for Jefferson himself to operate. Jefferson has gone for 22-328-0 in Addison's three games after totaling 12-200-1 in the three games prior to his return.But while Wentz has gotten the receivers going a bit, he's also unsurprisingly undermined the offense himself at times with ill-timed sacks and incomprehensible turnovers. He barely had to do anything in his first start against the Bengals thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns, and in his other three games, he has three touchdown passes against four interceptions. His pick-six against the Eagles last week was entirely inexplicable. Sometimes, he seemingly just has his processor go offline for a play or two or seven, and it looks like he hasn't played football before.Â \nAgainst a Chargers pass defense that ranks fourth in the NFL in success rate, that could be dangerous. Then again, we also saw the Chargers get absolutely torn apart by Daniel Jones last week, and part of their high success rate ranking is having played games against the Raiders, Broncos and Dolphins. So perhaps Wentz has more of a chance to get going here than it might appear on the surface. At the very least, O'Connell will scheme him into position for success, and then it's up to him to take advantage of being put in those good situations.\nThe Vikings may have more luck running the ball against a Chargers front that has gotten licked to the tune of 5.1 yards per carry and the league's third-highest rushing success rate. Jordan Mason should probably be expected to lead the backfield whether Aaron Jones returns from his hamstring injury or not (he's listed as questionable), and Mason has averaged 4.5 yards a pop so far this year. If Jones is out, I expect to see a lot of downhill runs for Mason, with the Vikings trying to work the play-action passing game off of that.Â Pick NFL at Underdog Fantasy, where new users who play $5 now get $100 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.When the Chargers have the ballThe Chargers have been one of the pass-heaviest teams in the NFL all season, dropping back on 64.9% of their plays, according to Tru Media. They also have the league's second-highest pass rate over expectation (PROE), according to Establish the Run, and that holds true for both the entire game and in neutral situations. They've been slightly less pass-happy over their last four games as they have dealt with injuries at tackle and running back, but they're still seventh in PROE during that time.\nThe reason this is particularly relevant for this game is that the Vikings have a pretty wide split between their effectiveness against the pass and against the run. According to Tru Media, they rank fifth so far this season in opponents' passing success rate and just 19th in success rate against the run. Opponents have thus been extremely run-heavy against the Vikes, calling a rush on 49.0% of their plays. \nThe Chargers, of course, may decide to go pass-heavy either way. The strength of their team at the moment isÂ Justin HerbertÂ and the pass-catchers. Even nominal starting running backÂ Kimani Vidal, who is filling in forÂ Omarion Hampton, is a better pass-catcher than a runner. He clocked the Dolphins on the ground two weeks ago, but so does everybody. In his career outside of that game, he's averaging around 3.4 yards per carry on his 56 totes. So, don't be surprised if it's a lot of Herbert dropping back and looking for the likes ofÂ Ladd McConkey,Â Quentin Johnston,Â Keenan AllenÂ and Orande Gadsden II on Thursday night.Â If and when he does drop back, the Chargers will be faced with a pass rush that blitzes at one of the highest rates in the NFL. The Vikings have sent extra rushers on 41.9% of dropbacks, via Tru Media, which ranks second-highest in the league behind only the Falcons. Minnesota has killed teams when rushing five or more players, ranking third in the league in EPA per dropback.Â \nWith L.A.'s issues up front (we still don't know whether the starting tackles will actually suit up; they're each listed as questionable), it'll be important for Herbert to get the ball out quickly, which could lead to more work for the underneath targets like McConkey, Allen and Gadsden than for Johnston, who does more of his work down the field. Around 44% of opponent passes against the Vikings have traveled 0 to 5 air yards, according to Tru Media, which is the third-highest rate in football. They've faced bottom-10 rates of throws in the 6 to 10, 11 to 20, and 20-plus air-yard range.The Chargers should definitely at least try to get the run game off the ground, but it could prove difficult with Vidal and practice-squad passing-down back Nyheim Hines in the backfield. (Hassan Haskins is also out -- not that he was particularly effective rushing the ball anyway.) They're not a particularly good run-blocking unit to begin with, and it's not like the Vikings are slouches against the run; they're just not as good against the run as they are against the pass.Â Instead, this is likely to be a strength-on-strength matchup, with Herbert facing Brian Flores and his creative schemes. That's one of the most potentially exciting matchups you can draw up in the league.Â \nPrediction\nIn a game where two teams seem likely to have more success running the ball than throwing due to the respective strengths of the opposing defenses, but also probably still want to rely on their passing game to some extent, I'm going to lean toward the team with the quarterback I trust more. That's pretty clearly the Chargers here.Pick: Chargers 24, Vikings 20\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It goes without saying to pay attention to results each week in college football, especially when it comes to streaks. Invariably, point spread win and loss runs expire each week and new ones begin. Streak lists from weeks past are not terribly important at the present; we're looking to identify just a handful of sides each week who might be ready to go on a new uptick or catch a downdraft.Â Into late October, we're still at the point of this 2025 campaign when trends can develop and carry through the final month of the regular season. How often we have seen such trends emerge from the end of October and onward? So, we continue to pay attention to these weekly lists, seeking to identify a few sides ready to go on extended runs.As we have throughout October, we note the weekly \"point spread reversal\" listing, wherein we identify teams off a spread result, win or lose, different from at least its two preceding spread results.Â  Again, another potential indicator of teams perhaps ready for a turnaround ... good or bad.Bet college football at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new usersÂ get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass with a winning $5 wager:Point spread reversal plus (+)The teams: Boise State, Florida International*, Jacksonville State, James Madison, Kentucky, Michigan, Middle Tennessee*, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon State, Penn State, Stanford, TCU, UAB, UTEP, UMass, Vanderbilt*Subsequent midweek game this week not included.Normally, this is the time of season when we try to identify teams that have been underachieving from the first half of the season and might now begin to offer some spread value. Though we're not on any Penn State bandwagon after recent developments in Happy Valley, the Nittany Lions (off this week) might be a team to watch into November, even minus QB Drew Allar. Penn State is not likely to be overvalued any longer this season, and it's interesting that the Nittany Lions did cover a number at IowaÂ in their first game minus HC James Franklin.Â Similarly, North Carolina at least didn't look as bad as in past weeks in the spread cover last Friday at Cal. After its shocker over Memphis, UAB might also be worth watching, perhaps beginning the sort of new-coach \"bounce\" for interim Alex Mortensen that we recently saw with UCLA after promoting Tim Skipper.Point spread reversal minus (-)The teams: Air Force, Appalachian State, Clemson, Duke, Eastern Michigan, Florida Atlantic, Illinois, Iowa, Kent State, Louisiana Tech*, Memphis, Miami-Fla, Texas A&M, Texas Tech, UL-Lafayette, Utah, Virginia, Western Kentucky**Subsequent midweek game this week not included.We have long maintained that it might be easier to find go-against teams in the later stages of a season than go-with sides. Sometimes those sorts come from teams that appear in the rankings. Thus, we keep an eye on the Miami Hurricanes, notorious for cooling off late in the season under HC Mario Cristobal, and perhaps even Texas A&M, still unbeaten but barely surviving (and not covering) last week at Arkansas and with a meatgrinder SEC slate still to come.ACC sources suggest Duke might have been playing over its head for a few weeks and are keeping an eye on the Blue Devils after the Georgia Tech loss. Clemson's appearance here has more to do with QB Cade Klubnik's injury that kept him out of last week's game vs. SMU; the dropoff to backup Christopher Vizzina is steep. The Tigers also aren't in action next until Nov. 1 vs. Virginia, by which point Klubnik might be ready to return.Point spread win streaks6: Alabama 5-0-1 last six4: Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Miami-Ohio, Northwestern, San Diego State, South Florida, Temple, Troy, Western Michigan, Maryland 3-0-1 last four, UCLA 3-0-1 last four3: Kansas State, Kennesaw State* Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Wake Forest, Washington State, Southern Miss 2-0-1 last three, UConn 2-0-1 last three2: Arkansas, Arkansas State, BYU, Coastal Carolina, Georgia Tech, Houston, Marshall, New Mexico State*, Ohio State, SMU, UCF, Wyoming.Â *Subsequent midweek game this week not included.Â The list above begins to thin considerably once past the three-game threshold, though we saw commentary for some of the lower-profile sides that continue to punch above their weight. In particular, Miami-Ohio, San Diego State, Temple, Troy and Western Michigan are all rather quietly going about their business and have pushed their spread win streaks to four.Â Of those on three straight covers, Pittsburgh's surge coincides directly with frosh QB Mason Heinstschel entering the starting lineup. Among those in the potential earliest stages of an uptick, we would pay attention to Arkansas, as its two spread covers in a row (though in outright losses) have come since interim Bobby Petrino took over for Sam Pittman. Arkansas State, expected to do a bit more this season, could be in the midst of salvaging its campaign for under-fire HC Butch Jones.Point spread losing streaks5: Boston College, Baylor, Northern Illinois, Texas State4: Florida State. Nebraska, South Alabama*3: Delaware*, Fresno State, Liberty, Missouri State*, Navy, Oklahoma State, UL-Monroe2: Akron, Auburn, Buffalo, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia State, Iowa State, Old Dominion. Ole Miss, Rice, Rutgers, San Jose State, South Carolina, Tennessee, Tulsa, UNLV, Virginia Tech, Wisconsin. Â *Subsequent midweek game this week not included.Some of the underachievers noted above have not shown signs of breaking their extended pointspread malaise, Boston College and Northern Illinois (each highlighted recently as \"fade\" candidates in this space) among them. As noted earlier, there are apt to be more teams packing it in down the stretch, especially these days with the rash of midseason coaching changes, etc.Â Things might be starting to unravel with some of those sides currently within the 2-game spread loss list; we'd watch Akron, as Joe Moorhead's regime has yet to make a breakthrough as pressure mounts in the Rubber City while we will keep a close watch on Florida after the Billy Napier dismissal earlier this week, with Billy Gonzales now promoted as the interim.Rutgers (at Purdue this week) and San Jose State (off until Nov. 1 vs. Hawaii) are both off this week, but recent indicators have not been positive for either. Â Â Away from spread past two decisions ... plus (+)Washington State +22.75UConn +22.50Coastal Carolina +22.00Marshall +21.75 San Diego State +20.75South Florida +19.50Western Michigan +19.50Northwestern +18.75 New Mexico State +18.50*Kennesaw State +17.50*Wake Forest +17.50Troy +16.50UCLA +16.25, Temple +15.25James Madison +13.25UCF +13.25Minnesota +12.25Colorado State +12.00Â Stanford +12.00Kent State +11.50Kansas State +9.75 Pittsburgh +8.50 Indiana +7.75Arkansas +7.50UAB +7.00*Subsequent midweek game this week not included. Â Jumping out from the above list is the fact we don't see a Power 4 conference representative until we get down to Wake Forest (+17.50); all of those above the Demon Deacons are from the Group of Five loops (or, in the cases of Washington State and UConn, their own special circumstances). The Cougars roaring to the top spot highlights a schedule curiosity this season, as in consecutive weeks, Wazzu seems to have caught a couple of ranked sides from the Power 4 either flat or looking ahead.The continued appearance of the likes of San Diego State and Western Michigan in the above list suggests the oddsmakers have yet to catch up to the Aztecs and Broncos. Â Away from spread past two decisions ... minus (-)Old Dominion -36.00Rice -23.00Fresno State -22.75Wisconsin -20.00Florida State -19.25Rutgers -19.00Ole Miss -15.50Michigan State -15.25California -14.75ULM -14.75Nebraska -14.50Charlotte -11.75 UMass -11.00Western Kentucky -10.75*Delaware -10.50*Northern Illinois -10.25Tulsa -10.00Buffalo -9.75Tennessee -9.75West Virginia -9.25Florida -8.75Nevada -8.75Oklahoma State -8.75Iowa State -8.50Akron -7.75Navy -7.50South Alabama -7.50*South Carolina -7.50Miami -7.25Boise State -7.00*-Subsequent midweek game this week not included.Â The top end of the above list always includes some eye-openers; we're not sure what has gone on with Old Dominion in its past two games (running into a hot James Madison last week might be one of the reasons), but it's not good. A number of those noted above also could fall into the \"overrated\" category, which can't be camouflaged for an entire season; count Florida State and Nebraska among those.Â We also keep an eye on teams with no coaches, whose regimes might start to lose traction as their initial campaigns proceed; Rice, Fresno State, Charlotte, and Tulsa could be among those.Â  Also, Wisconsin and South Carolina (more on the Gamecocks below) have been disappointments this season and might stick in this listing into November.Â  Â  Â Shade/Fade alert this weekNorthwesternThe Wildcats have emerged as one of the hot teams in the Big Ten. With four straight wins (and three straight covers), the Cats are one win away from bowl eligibility for the second time in three seasons under HC David Braun, whose current edition is reminding a lot of his surprising 2023 edition that qualified for the Las Vegas Bowl and upset Utah once there.Â Two years ago, however, NU was doing it with minimal offense. Now, with SMU transfer Preston Stone at QB, the offense has a sharper edge. As the case two years ago, it's a rock-ribbed defense that has the Wildcats on the prowl, ranking 11th nationally in scoring at a mere 15.1 points per game. The schedule gets interesting in the last month of the season, as NU will be playing a pair of games at the Cubs' Wrigley Field (vs. Minnesota and Michigan) in November. Â Next game: Saturday at NebraskaLean: ShadeÂ  Â NebraskaHow convenient to stick in the Big Ten with Northwestern's upcoming foe! We have suspected the hype meter has been way off on the Cornhuskers all season, as the national media seems hopeful of rekindling the glory days in Lincoln even though we're nearly 30 years on from Dr. Tom Osborne's last team. Not a peep from the Cornhuskers since, and we are beginning to wonder what all of the hype is about with HC Matt Rhule, who, upon inspection, hasn't accomplished all that much since 2019 at Baylor.This might be Rhule's best Nebraska edition, but last week's 24-6 beatdown administered by a modest Minnesota team suggests the hype might again be misplaced. Protecting QB Dylan Raiola continues to prove an issue, and we have to wonder if accompanying chatter about Rhule on Penn State's radar could cause a distraction.Next game: Saturday vs. NorthwesternLean: FadeMiami (OH)We've seen the RedHawks rally before in the MAC under long-serving HC Chuck Martin, who looks to have Miami on the move again. The RedHawks had another bumpy September, made more awkward by QB Dequann Finn getting hurt on what might have been one of the single worst plays of the season, a fluky pass interception vs. UNLV on Sept. 20 that was returned for a pick-six by the Rebels, swinging momentum of a game that Miami was dominating. Finn was crushed by a big hit on the play and suffered a concussion that kept him put until the Oct. 4 game at Northern Illinois, when he accounted for 260 yards of total offense in a 25-14 win. Â Finn, formerly a MAC MVP at Toledo before last year's transfer to Baylor, where he suffered painful early-season rib injury and never got back in the lineup, is an established dual-threat, and playing within himself, passing between 22-26 times in each of Miami's last three wins (part of an overall four-game uptick). As for Martin, he's now 18-3 straight-up and 15-6 vs. the spread in MAC games since 2023, and has a showdown game vs. Western Michigan at Yager Stadium this weekend, but a combo of one of the best defenses in the MAC along with a former MVP at QB suggests the RedHawks probably probably aren't done winning just yet.Next game: Saturday vs. Western MichiganÂ Â Lean: ShadeSouth CarolinaSeveral offensive coordinators/play-callers are feeling some heat in the SEC these days. Yet we don't think there has bee a bigger letdown than at South Carolina, where Shane Beamer's decision to promote veteran coach Mike Shula to OC after Dowell Loggains took the App State HC job has been nothing short of a disaster for the Gamecocks. Shula, on staff as an offensive analyst last season, hasn't been able to unlock dual-threat QB LaNorris Sellers as Loggains had. The latter was able to get Sellers into space a year ago and allow his mobility to generate big plays. None of that has occurred in 2025 as Sellers seems either boxed in the pocket, or designed run plays that don't fool the defense.Â SC ranks in the triple digits in 10 different offensive categories this season, with the latest display of ineptitude last week against Oklahoma in a 26-7 loss, a team SC beat 35-9 in Norman a year ago. As the defense has dropped a notch from last year's dominant unit, you can see why this is unraveling at Williams-Brice Stadium and now the rumor mill is starting to whirr even more loudly about Beamer perhaps going back to alma mater Virginia Tech.It's not a good situation right now in Columbia as the Gamecocks, ranked by most in the top 15 entering this season, are instead a couple of weeks away from becoming bowl-ineligible.Â  Â Next game: Saturday vs. Alabama Â Lean: FadeArkansas StateThere can be pressure in the Sun Belt, too, and they have known some success in Jonesboro across the past 15 or so years. Though the Red Wolves made a recovery the past two years qualifying for bowls, they have finished above .500 just once (a year ago) in four seasons on the watch of HC Butch Jones. Any backsliding this year, regional sources have insisted, could prove a big problem for Jones, who looked to be in serious trouble a few weeks ago after a loss at ULM dropped Ark State to 1-4 for a season in which many supporters were expecting a breakthrough.Well, it might not be too late, as the Red Wolves displayed a lot of character in back-to-back, white-knuckle wins as an underdog over Texas State and last week at South Alabama, hitting the game-winning field goal on the final play in Mobile. Suddenly, the Red Wolves are alive again in the Sun Belt race and dual-threat QB Jalen Raynor, a multi-year starter, continues as one of the top Belt performers, getting his run dimension re-established in the wins over the Bobcats and Jaguars after ULM shut off his escape routes on Sept. 27.Â Ark State was supposed to be a Sun Belt contender this season, and the Red Wolves are finally playing like one. Â Next game: Saturday vs. Georgia SouthernÂ Lean: Shade\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups was arrested on Thursday morning, as a federal grand jury indicted him in connection to his alleged participation in an illegal gambling scheme. This was the result of a wide-ranging gambling investigation that included two separate cases of illegal sports betting and gambling. Billups was one of three prominent NBA figures, along with Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones, to be arrested. More than 30 defendants in all have been charged.Â Billups is accused of taking part in illegal high-stakes poker games tied to La Cosa Nostra, an organized crime family in New York. According to U.S. attorney Joseph Nocella, these poker games targeted high-net worth individuals, which were lured by Billups and Jones. Rigged shuffle machines, X-ray tables that could read cards face down along with special contact lenses and eyeglasses that could read premarked cards were allegedly used to fix these card games.On Thursday night, Billups' attorney, Chris Heywood, released a statement on behalf of his client, saying that the former point guard will fight these charges with tenacity.Â \"Anyone who knows Chauncey Billups knows he is a man of integrity; men of integrity do not cheat and defraud others.To believe that Chauncey Billups did what the federal government is accusing him of is to believe that he would risk his hall-of-fame legacy, his reputation, and his freedom. He would not jeopardize those things for anything, let alone a card game.Furthermore, Chauncey Billups has never and would never gamble on basketball games, provide insider information, or sacrifice the trust of his team and the League, as it would tarnish the game he has devoted his entire life to.Chauncey Billups has never backed down. He does not plan to do so now. He will fight these allegations with the same tenacity that marked his 28-year career. We look forward to our day in court.\"As alluded to in the statement, Billups may also be tied to sharing inside information with bettors as a coach. He was not named in the Rozier indictment, but a person referred to as \"Co-Conspirator 8\" matches his description.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA gambling scandal, explained: What to know as Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier get arrested, suspended\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nÂ The NBA announced Thursday afternoon that both Billups and Rozier were being placed on \"immediate leave\" from their respective teams.\"We are in the process of reviewing the federal indictments announced today,\" the league said in a statement. \"Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities. We take these allegations with the utmost seriousness, and the integrity of our game remains our top priority.\"\nBillups has served as the coach of the Trail Blazers since 2021. During his playing days, Billups was a five-time All-Star, and won an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004. He had his No. 1 retired by the franchise, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2024.Â \n            ",

    "body": "\n        As Abby Wambach nodded the ball downwards in the penalty area at Subaru Park 15 years ago, Alex Morgan â in her trademark pink, DIY pre-wrap headband â made a well-timed run and came through with a simple finish, a perfect set-up for her first international goal. In retrospect, Morgan described it as \"the start of something great,\" almost an understatement for what came next.Morgan went on to score 123 goals for the U.S. women's national team, earn 220 caps over 14 years, win two Women's World Cups and an Olympic gold medal along the way â and those are only her accolades on the international stage. Her on-field accomplishments are just one aspect of the collection of great moments that made up her USWNT career, though. Morgan will return to the stadium where she scored her very first international goal on Thursday nearly 15 years to the day, taking part in one final retirement ceremony after she hung up her cleats last year. Instead of the 2,505 who filled the venue the day of her debut USWNT goal, though, Morgan will likely be greeted by a full house, the legacy she leaves behind in full view.\n\"I think for everyone on this team, she's just a hero for all of us and I think is someone who epitomizes what it means to leave something better than you found it,\" midfielder Sam Coffey, whose USWNT rise came towards the end of Morgan's national team career. \"I grew up watching her. I think every young girl growing up and playing, you're like, 'I love Alex Morgan!' I had a poster of her up on my wall. I had to take it down recently in my childhood bedroom.\"Morgan will be a spectator to a new-look version of the USWNT on Thursday in a friendly against Portugal, the first game in head coach Emma Hayes' preparation for next year's Women's World Cup qualification tournament. Hayes' youth-skewing team is made up of players who had her example to follow growing up, supported by a handful of veterans who have been tasked with instilling the USWNT's longstanding competitive and winning culture to the newcomers. Before Coffey and Rose Lavelle became the players responsible for passing on wisdom, there was Morgan and an entire generation of stars who shared the tricks of a very unique trade with them.\"I've been saying she and all these players that have been retiring recently, that's who taught us how to be excellent in this environment and I think that's what we try to consistently match and uphold,\" Lavelle, a member of the 2019 World Cup-winning team, said. \"I think it's the reason that this this program has been in such a good spot, is because of that legacy on the field that they've all left so I think she's taught me so much and I think now being in a position where I'm now a veteran leader, having her to look up to and learn from leading up to this moment has really been huge and has put all of us in a better position to be the best version of ourselves.\"\nIt is almost difficult to recall a time when Morgan was not a larger-than-life figure in women's soccer. She went from a player on the rise to a bonafide star in almost no time, breaking out during the 2011 Women's World Cup, the team's run to the final commanding a new level of attention that has not waned since. Morgan inherited the attention Mia Hamm left behind, becoming not only the face of the team but of the sport as a whole less than a year after scoring her first international goal in the Philadelphia suburbs. She was the rare professional women's soccer player who became a household name, always boasting the on-field credentials to back it up.\"There was nothing she didn't achieve,\" Hayes, who worked with Morgan briefly as the USWNT coach, said. \"She was a player that epitomized what this program is about. An unbelievable credit to her family because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none. You can't go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan and I think this sport should show a lot of gratitude to that because it's important for our players to be recognizable and she is, without question, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport. â¦ She's got so many telling moments that were difference-making moments in her career and the impact she's had on this team is immeasurable.\"Morgan's true greatness, though, lies in the fact that she coupled her unprecedented profile with the will to create meaningful change. Her legacy will always be two-fold, impressively becoming a rare athlete to leave such an indelible mark on the sport they played. She was not only the face of the USWNT as they won two World Cups; she was one of its faces as they waged an equal pay battle with the U.S. Soccer Federation that finally ended in a hard-fought victory with a historic settlement in 2022. Many of the players on the current roster have only ever known the pleasure of sharing equal working conditions with their USMNT counterparts and full stadiums, the potential of what women's soccer now fully visible for anyone to see.\n\"I think what she's done and continued to do for women's sports in general has been huge,\" Lavelle said, \"and I think we've all benefitted greatly from that and hopefully we can continue to pass on that legacy in the same way but it's huge shoes to fill.\"\n            ",

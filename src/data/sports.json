Most Valuable Promotions announced that the Nov. 14 boxing event headlined by Jake Paul vs. Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis had been canceled. The news comes after the latest domestic violence allegation against Davis, with a civil lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade County in late October.The lawsuit is the latest in a line of domestic violence allegations for Davis, the most recent of which stemmed from a incident wherein Davis allegedly struck his ex-girlfriend, and mother of his children, in the head during a dispute on Father's Day. Davis was arrested in July, but charges were dropped in August when the alleged victim declined to prosecute. The new lawsuit by an ex-girlfriend alleges battery and kidnapping in their relationship.After news of the lawsuit broke, MVP released a statement that they were investigating the situation. It was immediately believed Davis would be pulled from the event.\nRumors of potential replacement opponents have swirled since, including former UFC fighter and Paul opponent Nate Diaz, former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou, and popular boxers Ryan Garcia and Terence Crawford.MVP's statement Monday night claimed that Paul will still headline a Netflix card before the end of 2025.\n\"Our team has worked closely with all parties to navigate this situation responsibly,\" Nakisa Bidarian, CEO of Most Valuable Promotions, said. \"While we will not be moving forward with this event, our plan still remains for Jake Paul to headline an event on Netflix in 2025. Details regarding a new date, location, Jake's opponent, and additional bouts will be shared as soon as they are finalized. We thank Netflix, the Kaseya Center, and the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino for their partnership.\"\n            \n    ",

It marked Luvu's third hip-drop tackle of the season.The hip-drop tackle was outlawed by the NFL prior to the 2024 season. Here's how the league defines the now-illegal play:\"It is a foul if a player uses the following technique to bring a runner to the ground: (a) grabs the runner with both hands or wraps the runner with both arms; and (b) unweights himself by swiveling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and trapping the runner's leg(s) at or below the knee.\"\nWhile the hip-drop tackle is technically supposed to be a 15-yard penalty, officials are not quick to throw the flag on these plays. We've seen several hip-drop tackles go unpenalized on Sundays, but then fined after the fact. That has been the case with Luvu's infractions as well. \nIn nine games this season, Luvu has recorded 50 tackles, two sacks, two passes defensed and three quarterback hits. With Luvu out for Week 10, it could be Jordan Magee that takes his place in the starting lineup next to the veteran Bobby Wagner.\nSunday was brutal for the Commanders. Not only did Washington fall to 3-6 and lose Luvu for one game, but quarterback Jayden Daniels suffered a dislocated left elbow, wide receiver and kick returner Luke McCaffrey suffered a broken collarbone and cornerback Marshon Lattimore tore his ACL.\n            \n    ",

Weiss replaces the retiring Brian Snitker in the Braves' dugout. Weiss, 61, spent parts of 14 seasons in the majors, playing for the A's, Marlins, Rockies and concluding with three seasons for the Braves. He was part of the pennant-winning 1999 Braves, hitting .286 in the NLCS. Previously, Weiss managed the Rockies from 2013-16, going 283-365 and failing to make the playoffs. He's spent the past eight seasons as the Braves' bench coach, which is the MLB version of a top assistant, second-in-command.\nThe Braves have had a really nice run of success with Snitker and Weiss. Snitker took over as interim manager in 2016 after the dismissal of Fredi Gonzalez and impressed the higher-ups enough to keep the job on a full-time basis. Weiss joined as Snitker's No. 2 in 2018. Starting that season, the Braves had a run of six consecutive NL East titles and then a wild-card berth after that. They won more than 100 games twice and won the 2021 World Series. Obviously, Snitker was the boss there, but Weiss had to have had some hand in the managing of the team and there's something to be said for continuity in the dugout. Weiss was originally selected by the Athletics in the first round out of North Carolina in the 1985 Draft. He won American League Rookie of the year for the pennant-winning A's in 1988 and was their starting shortstop for the 1989 World Series championship and then again the following year for the third straight AL pennant. He made the All-Star team for the Braves in 1998. \nIt's been a busy managerial carousel since the end of the regular season. Nine teams have been searching for their next manager and so far we've seen seven teams fill their vacancy. The Rockies and Padres are still looking for their next manager. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Washington Commanders lost much more than just their sixth game of the season on Sunday night against the Seattle Seahawks, as star quarterback Jayden Daniels dislocated his left elbow with less than eight minutes remaining in the 38-14 defeat. Many were quick to criticize coach Dan Quinn for leaving his best player in the game with the contest already out of hand. Now, it looks like Daniels is going to miss several more contests as Washington's season continues to spiral. On Monday, Quinn took responsibility for leaving Daniels in the game too long, and risking his franchise quarterback's health.\n        \n            \n                Jayden Daniels injury update: Commanders star QB awaiting MRI for dislocated left elbow vs. Seahawks\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I know many of you have been asking about the thought process of Jayden being in the game in that situation. I get that,\" Quinn said. \"I've been thinking about it honestly nonstop too, and for me the answer is, man, I missed it.\"Quinn explained his thought process to reporters. On Daniels' final drive there was 12:30 remaining in the fourth quarter with his Commanders trailing 38-7. Quinn said that possession would be the last for certain players, such as Daniels and wide receiver Deebo Samuel. Quinn knew that the offensive play-calling would be relatively vanilla, and not call for Daniels to make plays with his legs -- but that's exactly where Quinn said he messed up. This is the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year, who is special as a scrambler. \nOn a second-and-goal with 7:39 remaining in the game, Daniels scrambled to his right but was taken down behind the line of scrimmage by Drake Thomas. The second-year signal-caller attempted to use his non-throwing hand to balance as he went down, and that's when his elbow popped. Quinn said that Daniels did not suffer any fractures to his arm, just the dislocation. Later in the week, he will have more information regarding if his quarterback could return at some point this season. Sunday night was costly for Washington from an injury standpoint, as the Commanders also lost wide receiver and kick returner Luke McCaffrey to a broken collarbone, and cornerback Marshon Lattimore tore his ACL.\nWith Daniels out, Marcus Mariota reenters the starting lineup. The veteran journeyman has started three games for Washington this season, winning one, and has thrown four touchdowns compared to three interceptions in those contests. Up next for the Commanders are the 5-3 Detroit Lions on Sunday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Chargers held on for a 27-20 victory over the lowly Titans in Week 9, but the win came with a significant loss. Left tackle Joe Alt suffered a right high ankle sprain, his second such injury this season, and the team announced Monday that Alt will undergo season-ending surgery to help stabilize the ankle.Alt missed three games earlier this season after suffering the same injury in Week 4, though a longer absence could be in store this time with a Monday MRI set to reveal an official strategy moving forward.Alt's presence -- or lack thereof -- protecting quarterback  Justin Herbert's blindside has been absolutely crucial for the Chargers this season.Chargers in 2025Joe Alt on the fieldJoe Alt off the fieldExpected points added per play0.10-0.03Net yards per attempt7.86.0Pressure rate43.5%38.4%The Chargers are 5-1 when Alt plays and 1-2 when he does not. Los Angeles has operated like one of the NFL's top five offenses when Alt is on the field, only to degrade to playing about as well as the Panthers -- the No. 22 offense in EPA per play -- when he is sidelined.Alt is playing left tackle because Rashawn Slater tore his patellar tendon in the preseason, shortly after becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history.\nAustin Deculus, who previously started in Alt's place, suffered an ankle injury in Week 7 and was inactive this week despite not carrying an injury designation. Starting guard Mekhi Becton (hand) was also inactive, and right tackle Bobby Hart left with groin and ankle injuries.On Los Angeles' final offensive drive, the offensive line was, from left to right, Jamaree Salyer, Zion Johnson, Bradley Bozeman, Foster Sarell and Trey Pipkins. It was the first time this season Salyer played left tackle and Sarell's first start at right guard. Pipkins hadn't started since Week 6.Alt's absence could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Herbert has taken 28 sacks this season, third-most in the NFL, and he has been contacted 80 times, most in the NFL.\nSunday, against a struggling Titans defense, Herbert was contacted 10 times. With the running backs struggling, he was the team's leading rusher with 57 yards and a touchdown.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ja Morant's first game back after the Memphis Grizzlies suspended him for conduct detrimental to the team didn't exactly go as planned. Morant scored 20 points and dished out 10 assists, but shot just 5 of 16 from the floor and turned the ball over five times in a 114-106 home loss to the Detroit Pistons. That dropped Memphis to 3-5, the last three losses having come in a row as part of the ongoing drama surrounding Morant, who called out his coaching staff following Friday's loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.With an absolutely brutal schedule stretch coming and several key players still injured, the Grizzlies really need to unite if they're going to seize control of their season. While Morant didn't explicitly fan the flames in his first public comments since the suspension, he did little to calm the situation down, either.When a reporter asked him if everything had been resolved, Morant responded with a question. \"Y'all asked that question to them, huh?\" he said, before adding that the reporters should know the answer because they had already asked coach Tuomas Iisalo, who, before Monday's game, said that they \"had a discussion and we're all looking to move forward and beat the Pistons tonight.\" When the reporter persisted, Morant responded \"yea, they told y'all that, right? There you go. Obviously they can't go and tell y'all something I didn't say.\" \nWhen another reporter asked if he has the same joy that we're used to seeing from him, Morant said \"no.\" When asked why, he shrugged, and when asked what would need to happen for him to get it back, he responded, \"we'll see.\" When asked if he thinks he has a good relationship with the franchise, he said \"yea, they told y'all that, right? If I didn't have a good relationship with them I wouldn't talk to them at all.\" And finally, when a reporter asked if he had any regrets about the way he played on Friday, he asked in response if \"that's your home run question? It sounds like a bait question.\"\nOne of the issues reportedly at the center of Morant's tension with the coaching staff were their rotations. Morant had not played more than 32 minutes in any game thus far this season coming into Monday's bout with the Pistons, and Iisalo had been removing him from the game for a stretch of each quarter rather than giving him a single, extended break in each half as most stars receive. While Morant played a season-high 35 minutes against the Pistons, he did sit for short stretches in each quarter, likely to accommodate Memphis' pace, which currently ranks No. 7 in the NBA.Whether Morant and Iisalo will be able to find common ground over time remains to be seen. Morant's minutes on Monday represent a slight compromise, but Iisalo maintained his basic substitution pattern, and while Morant didn't criticize him directly, the acknowledgment that he lacks his usual joy coupled with the somewhat abrasive tone of some of his answers suggests that there is more work to be done here in getting everyone on the same page. \nWith so many key players injured, the Grizzlies need Morant at his best moving forward if they are going to avoid a huge hole early in the season. They are already 3-5, and their next three games are at home against the Rockets, Mavericks and Thunder. After that, they depart for one of the hardest road trips on their schedule: at the Knicks, Celtics, Cavaliers and Spurs. If Memphis isn't careful, they could easily return from that trip several games below .500 in one of the deepest Western Conferences we've seen in years. The time to mend fences is now, and only time will tell if Morant and the Grizzlies will be able to do so. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFC squads looking to crawl their way back into the postseason picture will meet in Week 9 of 'Monday Night Football' when the Dallas Cowboys host the Arizona Cardinals. Dallas (3-4-1) is undefeated at home but enters off a 44-24 defeat at Denver last Sunday. Arizona (2-5) has the NFL's longest losing streak at five games and fell to Green Bay, 27-23, in Week 7 before having a bye last week. Jacoby Brissett will remain the starting quarterback for Arizona in place of the still recovering Kyler Murray (foot), according to coach Jonathan Gannon. Though he won't start, Murray is questionable to be active as a backup. Defensive lineman Walter Nolen III (calf) and cornerback Will Johnson (groin) are also questionable for Arizona. Dallas center Cooper Beebe (ankle) has been activated off of injured reserve and is expected to play. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Dallas is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Cardinals vs. Cowboys odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 53.5.

The Cards have won both three straight overall against the Cowboys as well as each of their last three trips to Dallas. Arizona's spread record has mirrored its outright record in these eight contests as the Cardinals have covered in seven of the eight. Despite a five-game losing streak this season, Arizona has covered in back-to-back contests, while Dallas is coming off both a straight-up and spread defeat.The Cardinals can take advantage of Dallas' porous defense on Monday as the Cowboys rank second-worst in points allowed, yards allowed and passing defense. Dallas is dead last in third-down defense, which plays into Arizona's strength as the latter ranks fifth in third-down offense. Plus, having Brissett under center isn't much of a downgrade for the team as the journeyman has back-to-back games with two touchdown passes against a pair of one-loss teams in Green Bay and Indianapolis, so he should find success versus the Cowboys. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:Why the Cowboys can coverFew teams can match the offensive firepower of Dallas, which leads the NFL in passing offense, ranks second in points scored and is also second in total yards gained. Dak Prescott leads the league in QBR while running back, Javonte Williams, ranks among the top four in both rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. George Pickens is third in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, while No. 1 wideout, CeeDee Lamb, has 184 yards and a score in his two games since returning from injury.While Arizona coming off a bye would seemingly help its chances of winning, it may not help its chances of covering. The Cardinals have lost each of their last three games versus the spread after a bye, and they are 2-5 ATS with a rest advantage since 2022. Meanwhile, the Cowboys have a knack for rising to the occasion when an opponent has an advantageous schedule. Dallas is 6-2 ATS when at a rest disadvantage since the start of the 2022 season. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Cowboys vs. Cardinals picksFor Cardinals vs. Cowboys   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 56 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Asante Samuel Jr. has been cleared for football activities after undergoing spinal fusion surgery in April. The former Chargers cornerback has already been in touch with several teams and is planning to make free-agency visits as soon as this week, per ESPN.A 2021 second-round pick, Samuel played in just four games last season after experiencing what he described as a stinger in both shoulders. Dr. David Okonkwo, a neurosurgeon for the Steelers, performed Samuel's surgery.Samuel, 26, had two interceptions in each of his first three seasons with the Chargers. In the 2022 AFC wild-card round, Samuel had three interceptions and six pass breakups during Los Angeles' loss to the Jaguars.Samuel's comeback attempt coincides with Tuesday's trade deadline. Given his status as a free agent, Samuel will likely attract attention from teams who could use help at cornerback but would prefer not to give up capital in order to get one.\nWhere will Samuel end up? Here's a rundown of some of his possible landing spots.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Ravens, Eagles bolster pass rush\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSteelers Pittsburgh could use some reinforcements at cornerback given its injuries in the secondary this season. The Steelers' need at cornerback was recently elevated with Jalen Ramsey moving to free safety to replace DeShon Elliott, who recently went on injured reserve. In this scenario, Samuel would work alongside Joey Porter Jr. (who had an interception in Pittsburgh's Week 9 win over the Colts), emerging backup Brandin Echols and former Pro Bowler Darius Slay, who has struggled during his first season with the Steelers. \nBengals Cincinnati is a given considering how bad its defense has been this season. The Bengals' secondary has been especially bad this season; Cincinnati has allowed the most passing yards and touchdown passes through nine games. A big reason for the Bengals' secondary woes has been Cam Taylor-Britt's demotion under first-year defensive coordinator Al Golden. 49ers While they're off to a surprising 6-3 start, San Francisco could use some reinforcements in the secondary if it is going to make a legitimate run at a Super Bowl. The 49ers are currently 20th in the NFL in pass defense, 17th in touchdown passes allowed and 30th in interceptions. San Francisco will need to improve in these areas if it is going to upstage Seattle (and its high-octane passing attack) in the NFC West. Eagles On paper, the defending champs would be an ideal spot for Samuel. In this scenario, he would likely be asked to provide depth to an already established unit. Samuel could especially come in handy on third down, as the Eagles' defense is just 26th in the league in that area. \nRavens Winners of two straight games, the Ravens are still hoping to grab one of the AFC's seven playoff spots two months from now. Adding some depth to their defense may go a long way in helping John Harbaugh's team accomplish that goal. Baltimore's defense has made strides in recent weeks, but is still one of the NFL's worst units against the pass. Cowboys Dallas owner and general manager Jerry Jones hasn't been shy about his willingness to make moves before the trade deadline. Given the Cowboys' issues on defense (and specifically in the secondary) this season, it would make sense for them to at least look into signing Samuel. Dallas' defensive challenges this season include cornerback Trevon Diggs being placed on injured reserve in October. \n            ",

With big names like Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, Trey McBride and Marvin Harrison Jr., an NFL SGP would figure to involve lots of prop picks. But your MNF same-game parlay can also involve Cardinals vs. Cowboys bets on the money line, against the spread or with the over/under. The money line could be of particular interest with your NFL same-game parlay as the Cardinals have won seven of the last eight meetings between the two.Arizona is at +147 on the money line, while Dallas is favored by 3.5 points, per the latest NFL odds. The over/under is 53.5 points. For Arizona to prevail, it would have to do so with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback in place of Kyler Murray (foot). Brissett could also find his way into your MNF SGP as he's thrown two touchdowns in back-to-back games and has NFL prop odds of -148 to go Over 1.5 passing touchdowns versus Dallas.

Despite the expected drop in going from Murray to Brissett, the Cardinals are actually averaging more points (25) with Brissett under center over the last two games than in the five that Murray started (20.6). However, Brissett's presence hasn't helped Arizona's defense, as the team's two highest point totals allowed have come in its last two games. The Over has hit in three straight Cardinals games, while each of the last five Dallas games have gone over.Whenever you average the second-most points per game, and allow the second-most points per game, as Dallas does, then games will often live in the Over. Also, it's important to remember that the Cowboys will host this game, and their three highest-scoring games of the year -- in which they reached at least 40 points in each -- all came at home. Since 2023, the Over is 15-6 (71.6%) in Cowboys home games, which is tied for the highest percentage in the NFL over that span. The model has the Over hitting in more than 50% of simulations, projecting a combined 56 points. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here,How to make Cardinals vs. Cowboys SGP picksThe model also jumped on two other Cowboys vs. Cardinals SGP picks, including one bet that returns plus money. You can only see the model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top MNF same-game parlay picks, and which NFL prediction has a plus-money payout?

Arizona also lost its leading scorer from last season to the NBA.

Dallas entered the week with the second-best scoring offense at 30.8 points per game. That alone is great news for an Over bet, but it doesn't end there. On the opposite side of the ball, the Cowboys have the second-worst scoring defense at 31.3 ppg allowed, which has resulted in the Over hitting in five straight Dallas games. The Cardinals are starting Jacoby Brissett at quarterback with Kyler Murray (foot) still out, and Arizona's offense has been more efficient without Murray.

Houston has won by an average of 24.3 ppg over this winning streak, so a 12.5-point margin certainly isn't too daunting. The Rockets are averaging 134.7 points with at least 128 points in each game during this run, with Kevin Durant leading the charge at 27.2 ppg.

    "body": "\n        Riding a two-game winning streak, the Baltimore Ravens are once again buyers at the trade deadline as John Harbaugh's team looks to keep its momentum going. On Monday night, the Ravens added to their defense by acquiring veteran pass rusher Dre'Mont Jones from the Titans, who at 1-8 are one of the expected deadline sellers. The 28-year-old Jones is having arguably the best season of his career. Through nine games, the seven-year veteran has 4.5 sacks, 26 tackles, and a fumble recovery. While never a star, Jones has nonetheless been a consistent and reliable pass rusher throughout his career. Jones, who has 35 career sacks, has had at least 4.0 sacks each year since 2020, his second year in the NFL. Baltimore is Jones' third team in as many seasons. After spending his first four years with the Broncos, Jones spent two seasons with the Seahawks before signing a one-year deal with the Titans in the offseason. While it takes two to tango, there is a clear winner from this trade. Let's take a look at which team was the winner in our instant trade grades. \nThe trade Ravens get: OLB Dre'Mont Jones Titans get: 2026 conditional fifth-round pick (could become a fourth-rounder)Ravens: AWith 11 sacks in eight games, Baltimore desperately needed to bolster its pass rush. The Ravens not only got that with Jones, they also got a player who appears to be in the middle of a career year. The cherry on top of this deal is that the Ravens didn't have to give up one of their top picks in next year's draft to acquire him.The Eagles, for example, gave up a third-round to acquire former Dolphins pass rusher Jaelan Phillips, who hasn't played as well as Jones has during the season's first nine games. Baltimore got arguably a better player and gave up less trade capital to acquire him. Jones' addition addresses one of the Ravens' biggest needs while reinforcing the narrative that Baltimore is in no way cashing out on this season. Despite their 3-5 record, the Ravens are currently in second place in the AFC North with five games remaining against divisional foes.\nGiven their need for a pass rusher, it's hard to find many flaws in this trade from Baltimore's perspective. That being said, the Ravens did have to give up a conditional fifth-round pick that could turn into a fourth-round pick. Draft picks are a valuable commodity, after all, so Jones and the Ravens have to perform if this trade is going to be remembered as a success.Jones is also only one player, so unless some of their other pass rushers (i.e., rookie Mike Green) step up, Baltimore's pass rush will only improve so much.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Ravens, Eagles bolster pass rush\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTitans: B This is a very \"meh\" trade for a Titans team that is in full rebuild mode. While this isn't a horrible trade for Tennessee, you wonder if it could have gotten more for an established pass rusher ahead of the trade deadline.\nThat being said, it's clear the Titans felt the Ravens' offer was the best they could do. Instead of waiting until tomorrow and possibly driving up the price, Tennessee decided to make a move now on the eve of the trade deadline.This trade will look a lot better from the Titans' standpoint if this turns into netting a fourth-round pick. But either way, the Titans achieved their mission of trading a veteran player in exchange for draft picks they can use for the future.On a larger scale, the trade of Jones is another example of a plan that went horribly wrong for a Titans team that was hoping to turn the corner this year. Instead of taking advantage of Jones' big season and possibly extending him this offseason, the Titans' disaster that has been the 2025 campaign has forced them to change course, which has led to the departure of several notable players — a list that now includes Jones.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 11 of the college football season will be the first time teams at the top know exactly where they stand with the College Football Playoff committee. We'll get the first committee rankings on Tuesday night, and that'll set the tone for what should be a very fun weekend of games, headlined by six matchups involving top 10 teams that have something to prove. The most unique element of the College Football Playoff is the need for style points, as not all wins are created equal. And for teams that have already played their toughest competition, they have to keep the gas pedal down to keep the committee impressed. Then there are the conference championship game implications, with plenty still to be sorted out in the Big Ten, SEC, ACC and Big 12. Chaos reigns in the ACC, especially after Georgia Tech's loss last week, while the Big 12 once again has a million scenarios in play, as is a seemingly annual occurrence. The SEC has two undefeated teams in conference play in Texas A&M and Alabama, but both still have some big games to navigate on their schedule, including this week. The Big Ten title race is much simpler, as Ohio State and Indiana have cleared an apparent path to a showdown in Indianapolis, but they still need to take care of business to ensure that No. 1 vs. No. 2 battle happens. All of that sets the table for an exciting Week 11, and here are our predictions for the six biggest games on the schedule for Saturday. \n\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Notre Dame crashes top 10 in college football rankings, resurgent Texas climbs\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNo. 8 BYU at No. 9 Texas Tech\nThe only top-10 battle in the country will take place in Lubbock where undefeated BYU takes on its biggest test of the season against Texas Tech. This game figures to be decided in the trenches, where both teams have had the advantage on most opponents all season. BYU has leaned on teams with one of the nation's best rushing attacks, as it averages 5.4 yards per carry and 216 rushings yards per game. LJ Martin and Bear Bachmeier present a difficult problem for opposing defenses attacking downhill and challenge opponents' physicality and desire to hit for all 60 minutes, but they've yet to face a defense quite like Texas Tech. The Red Raiders lead the nation in rush defense, allowing just 74 yards per game and 2.4 yards per carry. Not having Skyler Gill-Howard in the middle anymore has weakened them a touch, and we saw last week Kansas State had the most success of any opponent all season (126 yards and two TDs on 4.2 yard per carry) with an offense that features a running QB. Still, they will make life difficult for BYU up front and whichever of the BYU offensive line and the Texas Tech defensive line win more consistently will likely determine this football game. \nTexas Tech's performance against K-State impressed me. I thought that could be an upset spot and while it took some time for the offense to get going, they opened things up late and the defense got big stops when they needed them to put the game on ice. I think this game might look a lot like that one, with BYU finding some success on the ground but struggling to hit the kinds of explosives in the run game. Over 60 minutes, I think the Red Raiders pull clear and move back on top of the Big 12 standings. PICK: Texas Tech 34-27 over BYUNo. 2 Indiana at Penn State\nPenn State comes home after giving everything it had in Columbus and it simply not being enough, and will be greeted by an Indiana team that's handing out beatdowns to the rest of the Big Ten like candy on Halloween. Credit to Terry Smith for getting the boys to battle as hard as they did against Ohio State and keeping it close for a half, but I'm concerned this Penn State squad might not have a whole lot in the tank for this game. The Hoosiers have won their last three games by an average of 40 points, as there are no signs that Curt Cignetti's group is satisfied with just getting through the weak points of their schedule. It is clear the message in that locker room is that the mentality each week has to be the same, especially after they almost got caught sleepwalking in Iowa City the week before going to Oregon. That message has been received, and there is no letup on either side of the ball for 60 minutes -- whether it's starters or backups in the game. \nNothing I saw from Penn State last week indicates there's a sleeping giant about to get woken up in Happy Valley, and I expect this game to look a lot like most every Indiana game we've seen this season. It might be close after a quarter, but by the time the final whistle blows, Beaver Stadium will be mostly emptied out except for the folks in red that made the trip from Bloomington. PICK: Indiana 38-13 over Penn StateNo. 5 Georgia at Mississippi State\nThe all-Bulldog battle in Starkville will be an interesting test for a Georgia team that has not looked dominant much at all this season. Georgia eked out a win over rival Florida last week and now faces a much-improved Mississippi State team on the road. Mississippi State finally picked up its first SEC win in two years in a thriller in Arkansas last week after coming up painfully short of upset wins over Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Now they'll get one more shot at taking down one of the SEC's big dogs (pun intended), and Georgia better be ready from the jump or it could find itself down quickly. \nSlow starts have been the M.O. for the Dawgs under Kirby Smart for some time, as they've had a propensity to play with their food early and then try to hit the gas in the second half after making adjustments. This season it's taken a little longer to get it in gear than they'd like when they do try to flip that switch, and the result has been some extremely stressful games.  So far, Alabama is the only team to punish them for it, but Tennessee, Auburn, Ole Miss and Florida have all had early leads on Georgia only to watch the Dawgs nose in front by the final whistle. It would not surprise me at all if the cowbells are ringing like crazy early in Davis Wade Stadium as Mississippi State jumps out in front, but everything about how this season's gone for both teams says in the fourth quarter Georgia is going to find a way to escape with a win. PICK: Georgia 37-31 over Mississippi StateNo. 6 Oregon at Iowa\nOregon's offense has not been as dynamic in Big Ten play as we've come to expect, and the Ducks will get quite the test on the road this week when they travel to Iowa City to face the Hawkeyes. \nAs is always the case with Iowa teams under Kirk Ferentz, this year's Hawkeyes try to lean on defense and solid special teams. They're fourth in the country in points per game allowed (13.1), and for an Oregon offense that has had some struggles with consistently moving the ball, they're going to have to have one of their best performances of the season to avoid an upset loss on the road. This is an Iowa defense that held Indiana to its lowest scoring output of the season (20 points) and they are among the best in the country at limiting explosives. The Hawkeyes have allowed the second-fewest plays of 10+ yards (56) in the nation, tied with Ohio State and Oregon. With big plays at a premium in this game, it'll come down to sustaining drives and, perhaps, which defense can create a critical turnover or two. It's hard to know how much to take away from Oregon's 28-7 win against Wisconsin in terrible weather, but going on the road to Iowa City in November is no easy task. There's a reason this line is a short 5.5 and it certainly feels like the Ducks are going to have to prove their bonafides in their new conference by winning an old-school Big Ten kind of game where points are hard to come by. PICK: Oregon 20-16 over Iowa\nWatch Oregon vs. Iowa live Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming live on CBSSports.com, the CBS Sports App and Paramount+ Premium.No. 3 Texas A&M at No. 19 Missouri\nBeau Pribula's injury put a bit of a damper on the excitement for this game, but Matt Zollers played pretty well after being thrust into action against Vanderbilt, and Eli Drinkwitz had a bye week to get him up to speed and adjust the offense to his strengths. That latter point will present the biggest challenge to Texas A&M, as they'll be flying a bit blind into this one. Based on what we saw in Nashville, Zollers won't be near the rushing threat Pribula was, but the Tigers might open things up more in the passing game. The Aggies won't have much in the way of tape to figure out exactly what Mizzou will want to do in key situations with Zollers under center, and they'll have to be nimble with their game plan and ready to make necessary adjustments if the Tigers look a bit different than what they prepared for. \nOn offense, the Aggies have been lighting opponents up all season, scoring 31+ in all but one game. Despite losing Le'Veon Moss against Florida, the rushing attack hasn't skipped a beat and Marcel Reed has been spectacular as both a passer and runner this season. They will present the biggest test for this Mizzou defense yet, as the Tigers have been excellent on defense this season but have also benefitted a bit from playing some teams that are happy to grind it out in a slugfest. The Aggies will want to push the tempo and if Mizzou opens up the passing game a bit more with Zollers, I could see this game being more of a shootout. I won't be surprised if there's some early success from the Mizzou offense coming off the bye with a new QB, but I do expect Texas A&M to be able to keep pace and eventually pull ahead to remain unbeaten. PICK: Texas A&M 34-27 over MissouriLSU at No. 4 Alabama\nHow much did LSU's players dislike Brian Kelly? That's what I'm excited to find out this week. The Tigers have looked flat on offense all year and the vibes in Baton Rouge finally got rotten enough that Kelly was ousted despite his massive buyout. Now the Tigers turn things over to Frank Wilson in the interim and his first task is to go into Tuscaloosa and face a Crimson Tide team that is undefeated in SEC play and fresh off a bye week. \nAside from the opening loss to Florida State that looks weirder and weirder each week, the Alabama offense has been able to score on everyone, and if the LSU defense can't get back to the form they showed early in the year, they'll be in trouble. I'm curious to know how much of that was a team that just didn't believe in what their coach was preaching and how much of it is just a team that maybe got figured out.They will need the offense to show something they haven't been able to all season, because Alabama is going to put 24+ points on the board, even if the Tigers play well on the defensive side of the ball. Garrett Nussmeier has taken a beating this year, and the LSU line is going to need to find a way to control the line of scrimmage to give them a chance. We haven't seen that this year, but a coaching change can sometimes light a fire and bring the best out of a group. If this game were in Baton Rouge, you could talk me into the Tide being on upset alert. They have been far more gettable on the road this year, with three one-score wins and the FSU loss. At home? It's been a very different story. Alabama's been a buzzsaw at Bryant-Denny, winning all four games by at least two touchdowns -- including visits from Vanderbilt and Tennessee. I think this will be tight at the half, but Ty Simpson and company will just be too much for LSU's offense to keep up with for four quarters. PICK: Alabama 33-24 over LSU\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball, in conjunction with the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA), has announced the finalists for the 2025 major awards: Most Valuable Player, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year and Manager of the Year. As a reminder, the voting was completed before the playoffs even started. In fact, ballots were due before the first pitch of the playoffs. That means these are regular-season awards. Further, there's no voting after finalists are announced or anything like that. The word, \"finalists,\" is kind of misleading actually. The ballots have already been tabulated and the league office is simply revealing the top three vote-getters for each award to create a buzz before the winners are announced. The announcement schedule is as follows. Monday, Nov. 10: Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year AwardsTuesday, Nov. 11: Manager of the Year AwardsWednesday, Nov. 12: Cy Young AwardsThursday, Nov. 13: Most Valuable Player AwardsOnto the finalists. American League MVP Aaron Judge, Yankees: The two-time MVP hit .331/.457/.688 (215 OPS+) with 30 doubles, 53 home runs, 114 RBI, 137 runs, 12 steals and 9.7 WAR. Should Judge win, he'd join a list of 12 players to have won three MVPs or more, including fellow Yankees Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle and Alex Rodriguez (though he won one with the Rangers). Cal Raleigh, Mariners: He hit .247/.359/.589 (169 OPS+) with 24 doubles, 60 home runs, 125 RBI, 110 runs, 14 steals and 7.3 WAR, becoming the first catcher and first switch-hitter to ever get to 60 home runs. The Mariners only have two MVPs in their history (Ken Griffey Jr. in 1997, Ichiro Suzuki in 2001). \nJosé Ramírez, Guardians: He's been the runner-up before and has finished third twice. He's all but guaranteed to come in third again. This will mark his seventh top-six finish in voting without having won the award. This time around, he hit .283/.360/.503 (137 OPS+) with 34 doubles, 30 home runs, 85 RBI, 103 runs, 44 steals and 5.8 WAR. American League Cy YoungHunter Brown, Astros: The 26-year-old right-hander had a breakout season, going 12-9 with a 2.43 ERA, 1.03 WHIP and 206 strikeouts against 57 walks in 185 ⅓ innings. Thanks to the Prospect Promotion Incentive, the Astros get a compensatory draft pick by virtue of Brown being in the top three.Garrett Crochet, Red Sox: In 205 ⅓ innings, Crochet struck out 255 against 46 walks. He was 18-5 with a 2.59 ERA in his first year with the Red Sox. The last Red Sox pitcher to win the Cy Young was Rick Porcello in 2016.\nTarik Skubal, Tigers: The American League hasn't had a repeat Cy Young winner since Pedro Martinez in 1999-2000, but Skubal has a great shot here to go back-to-back. Last year's Cy Young winner was 13-6 with a 2.21 ERA, 0.89 WHIP and 241 strikeouts compared to only 33 walks in 195 ⅓ innings.American League Rookie of the YearRoman Anthony, Red Sox: Anthony only appeared in 71 games, but he got his money's worth. He hit .292/.396/.463 (140 OPS+) with 18 doubles, a triple, eight home runs, 32 RBI, 48 runs, four steals and 3.1 WAR. Nick Kurtz, Athletics: Though he didn't debut until April 23, Kurtz put up some serious numbers, finishing with 36 home runs. He also hit .290/.383/.619 (173 OPS+) with 26 doubles, two triples, 86 RBI, 90 runs and 5.4 WAR. \nJacob Wilson, Athletics: He started the All-Star Game and hit .311/.355/.444 (121 OPS+) with 26 doubles, 13 home runs, 63 RBI, 62 runs and 2.9 WAR. There have been eight A's Rookies of the Year, but none since Andrew Bailey in 2009. American League Manager of the YearJohn Schneider, Blue Jays: Again, keep in mind that ballots were cast before the playoffs started, so Schneider can't get credit for winning the Blue Jays' first pennant since 1993. Still, they led the AL in wins and won their first AL East title since 2016. This after they finished in last place in 2024. Stephen Vogt, Guardians: The Guardians won the AL Central for the second straight year, but this one was historic. They trailed the Tigers by as many as 15 ½ games and they were down by 11 with 23 games to play. They went 19-4 to finish the season as division champs.\nDan Wilson, Mariners: The Mariners won the AL West for the first time since 2001. They did so on the strength of a furious finish. They won 17 out of 18 games to clinch the division before the final series of the season. They were 3 ½ games out of first before the stretch.National League MVPShohei Ohtani, Dodgers: There isn't really suspense here, so we don't need to pretend otherwise. Ohtani is going to win this award and join Barry Bonds as the only players in history with at least four MVPs. Bonds has seven and this will be Ohtani's fourth. This season, he hit .282/.392/.622 (179 OPS+) with 25 doubles, nine triples, 55 home runs, 102 RBI, 146 runs, 20 stolen bases and 6.6 WAR on the offensive side. On the mound, he was 1-1 with a 2.87 ERA, 1.04 WHIP and 62 strikeouts against nine walks in 47 innings.Kyle Schwarber, Phillies: Schwarber had never finished higher in MVP voting than 15th. This season, he played in all 162 games, hitting .240/.365/.563 (150 OPS+) with 56 homers, 132 RBI and 111 runs. He led the NL in home runs and the majors in RBI. \nJuan Soto, Mets: Soto had previously never stolen more than 12 bases in a season, but he shockingly led the NL this year with 38. He also had 43 home runs, 105 RBI, 120 runs and hit .263/.396/.525 (160 OPS+) with 6.2 WAR. National League Cy YoungCristopher Sánchez, Phillies: Sánchez led the majors in pitcher WAR with 8.0. He became the Phillies ace this season with Zack Wheeler getting injured late. Sánchez was 13-5 with a 2.50 ERA, 1.06 WHIP and 212 strikeouts against 44 walks. Paul Skenes, Pirates: The 2024 Rookie of the Year finished third in this race last season. This time around, he went 10-10 with a 1.97 ERA (best in the majors), 0.95 WHIP and 216 strikeouts against 42 walks in 187 ⅔ innings. He had 7.6 WAR. There have only been two Pirates Cy Young winners (Vernon Law in 1960 and Doug Drabek in 1990). \nYoshinobu Yamamoto, Dodgers: If this did include the postseason, maybe Yamamoto would win it. It does not, though. In the regular season, he went 12-8 with a 2.49 ERA, 0.99 WHIP and 201 strikeouts in 173 ⅔ innings with 5.0 WAR. National League Rookie of the YearDrake Baldwin, Braves: The 24-year-old catcher hit .274/.341/.469 (126 OPS+) with 18 doubles, 19 home runs, 80 RBI, 56 runs and 3.3 WAR. The Braves have a rich history of winning this award, with nine of them, most recently Michael Harris II in 2022.Caleb Durbin, Brewers: Coming over in the trade that sent Devin Williams to the Yankees, Durbin hit .256/.334/.387 (101 OPS+) with 25 doubles, 11 homers, 53 RBI, 60 runs, 18 steals and 2.9 WAR. Only three Brewers have ever won this award, most recently Williams in 2020.\nCade Horton, Cubs: In only 23 outings, Horton went 11-4 with a 2.67 ERA (144 ERA+), 1.09 WHIP and 97 strikeouts in 118 innings. The last Cubs Rookie of the Year was Kris Bryant in 2015.National League Manager of the YearTerry Francona, Reds: After a year off, Francona went from Cleveland to the other Ohio team and took the Reds to the playoffs for the first time in a full season since 2013.Pat Murphy, Brewers: Only twice ever has a manager won this award in back-to-back years (Bobby Cox in 2004-05 and Kevin Cash in 2020-21). Murphy is looking to join the list after the Brewers led the majors in wins this season with 97. \nRob Thomson, Phillies: The Phillies won the NL East for the second straight season under Thomson after having not won it previously since 2011. They finished 96-66, their best record since 2011. \n            ",

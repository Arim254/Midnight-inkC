    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL Championship Round takes place on Sunday as the Broncos host the New England Patriots (-5.5) at 3 p.m. ET and the Seahawks host the Rams (+2.5) at 6:30 p.m. ET. While one could pursue standard NFL bets like the spread and total with a Championship Round NFL parlay, you could also take a chance on plus-money predictions. Wagers like alternate lines, exact score predictions and NFL props often have huge returns, and stringing them together within a single bet could be an NFL longshot parlay worth pursuing.The Pats have won four straight games by double digits and now get to face a backup quarterback in Jarrett Stidham who hasn't thrown a pass in two years. If you expect another huge Pats victory, then you could back New England on an alternate spread as Patriots -13.5 has +242 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. This could be a standalone bet or as part of an NFL longshot parlay prediction. Before making any Championship Round NFL picks or parlays, you need to see the Championship Round NFL longshot parlay from SportsLine's proven computer simulation that pays out $1.1 million on a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the AFC and NFC Championship Games on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Championship Round NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $1.1 million for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.Top Championship Round NFL parlay picksFor the Championship Round, one of the picks featured in the parlay is taking Denver's Zach Allen to have 1+ sacks (+191) versus the Patriots. Denver's 68 sacks led the NFL in the regular season and were just four shy of matching the all-time NFL record. Allen is the only member of this elite Broncos defense to be a First-Team All-Pro as the lineman had 7.0 sacks and lived in the offensive backfield. His 47 QB hits led all NFL players, even topping Myles Garrett, who set the single-season sack record.New England has allowed five sacks in back-to-back games, and just three quarterbacks were sacked more often than Drake Maye (47) in the regular season. Allen has at least 0.5 sacks in his last two playoff games, and this season he has three times as many sacks playing at home than in road stadiums. The Broncos are projected to have 4.42 sacks on Sunday, making this an NFL prop with great value to back. See the rest of the picks in the Championship Round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Allen to record a sack using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.1 millionThe parlay also includes six additional picks from the Championship Round from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that return higher than +400. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the Championship Round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.1 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

    "body": "\n        The Mets have bolstered their rotation with one of the top starters in the game. New York is set to acquire two-time All-Star Freddy Peralta in a four-player trade with the Milwaukee Brewers, the teams announced late Wednesday. Pitcher Tobias Myers is also going to the Mets, while prospects Brandon Sproat and Jett Williams are headed back to Milwaukee.Peralta, 29, is the latest big-name Brewer to get traded away one year prior to free agency, joining Corbin Burnes and Devin Williams. Milwaukee picked up Peralta's bargain $8 million club option earlier this offseason, but once Brandon Woodruff accepted the $22.025 million qualifying offer, the club ran into payroll issues. The Peralta trade clears money and adds talent.\nThis past season was a career year for Peralta, who finished fifth in the National League Cy Young voting. He made 30 starts for the third straight season and set new career bests in wins (17), innings (176 ⅔), ERA (2.70), and WAR (5.5). That 5.5 WAR was fourth in the NL and eighth among all pitchers. Peralta is, unquestionably, one of the game's best starting pitchers.With the Mets, he will headline a rotation that includes some combination of standout rookie Nolan McLean, Jonah Tong, Clay Holmes, Sean Manaea, David Peterson and Kodai Senga. President of baseball operations David Stearns, who worked with Peralta in Milwaukee, had been vocal about his wish for a frontline starter for the 2026 season.\n\"Acquiring Freddy adds another established starter to help lead our rotation,\" Stearns said in a statement. \"Throughout the offseason, we sought to complement our rotation with another front-end pitcher, and we're thrilled we are able to bring Freddy to the Mets.\"This caps a busy offseason for the Mets, which also saw them add Bo Bichette, Marcus Semien, Luis Robert Jr., Jorge Polanco, and others while bidding adieu to mainstays like Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil, Brandon Nimmo, and Edwin Díaz.Even after trading away their ace, the NL Central champion Brewers boast impressive rotation depth. Their rotation depth chart currently looks like this:\nRHP Brandon WoodruffRHP Jacob MisiorowskiRHP Quinn PriesterRHP Chad PatrickRHP Logan HendersonLHP Robert GasserLHP DL HallWith a typical Peralta season in 2026, the Mets will be able to make him the qualifying offer next offseason and receive a compensation draft pick should he sign elsewhere. That would offset the trade cost a bit. And, of course, there is always the possibility of a long-term extension, which is preferable to a compensation draft pick.Peralta is entering the final option year of a five-year, $15.5 million contract extension he signed in February 2020. That contract included $8 million club options for both 2024 and 2025, making Peralta one of the game's top pitching bargains.Myers, 27, made six starts and 16 relief appearances for the Brewers in 2025. Over parts of two MLB seasons, he has an ERA+ of 132 and an FIP of 3.92 in 188 ⅔ innings. \nAs for the Brewers' side of things, the outfielder Williams was ranked by CBS Sports as the No. 14 prospect in the National League East. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up: \"Williams will test your preconceived notions. He's a 5-foot-7 speedster who has experience at all three up-the-middle positions. Yet his offensive game isn't built on a strong foundation of bat-to-ball skills. Rather, he's all about the slug. Williams lifts and pulls the ball at high frequencies, allowing him to get the most from pedestrian strength markers. The downside here is that Williams swings and misses a lot (he had a 73.5% contact rate in Triple-A), meaning he's likely to strike out around a quarter of the time in the majors. He should provide enough of everything else -- power, walks, defense, and baserunning -- to enjoy a big-league career. It just won't be the one you'd expect at first blush.\"The 25-year-old Sproat is a right-hander who made four starts for the Mets last season. Across parts of two minor-league campaigns, the University of Florida product pitched to a 3.83 ERA and a 2.57 K/BB ratio in 48 starts and two relief appearances. During his brief stint in the majors in 2025, Sproat averaged 96 mph with his fastball. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Mets have regrouped nicely, huh? Their offseason got off to a disastrous start, but they've filled in most of their holes with impact players, the latest being Freddy Peralta, who was acquired in a trade Wednesday night for a pair of top-100 prospects. Let's dive into the Fantasy implications of this deal for both sides:Mets acquire Freddy PeraltaPeralta slides right into the top of the Mets rotation with this move. He's not your prototypical, innings-eating ace, but he's typically very good when he's on the mound. There are more ups and downs than you'd prefer – there's a lot of Blake Snell, albeit less extreme on both ends of the spectrum – but at the end of the day, Peralta typically puts in 160-175 innings of a mid-3.00s ERA and 200 or so strikeouts.And he's moving to one of the few spots around baseball that might not represent a huge downgrade from the one he was in in Milwaukee. The Mets probably won't match the Brewers' 97 wins from a year ago, but this should be a very competitive team, with a good home park and a great defense backing him up. Bo Bichette is unproven at third base, but if he can handle it, the Mets could have plus defense at the key infield positions, plus left field and center field. It's a nice landing spot, if you have to leave one as good as Milwaukee.Peralta, of course, already costs quite a bit in Fantasy drafts, with his ADP up to 69.1 in NFBC drafts in the month of January. I think that's probably an overpay based on last year's inflated win total and unsustainably low ERA (2.70 ERA compared to a 3.47 xERA), but that doesn't mean I think Peralta is likely to be a bad pick – 200 strikeouts and good, but not great ratios never goes out of style. And his new landing spot should help him sustain his value. As long as his price doesn't keep rising, he represents a solid, albeit imperfect choice for the No. 2 spot in your rotation.\nPeralta's value holds steady, so the more interesting side of the deal comes from the prospects the Mets gave up to get him. Brewers acquire Jett Williams, Brandon SproatLet's meet WilliamsFor one year of Peralta's services, the Brewers acquired a pair of top-100 prospects in shortstop Jett Williams and pitcher Brandon Sproat. Sproat has made his MLB debut while Williams got to Triple-A last season, so they not only got two top-100 prospects, but they got two who could help their team in 2026. Now, a quick note before we move on: I am, personally, not a huge fan of either of the players the Brewers acquired here. It's giving me shades of the Corbin Burnes trade from a few years ago, one the Brewers haven't gotten much out of. I'll note where my skepticism with each lies, but I'll also lean on others' scouting reports to provide both sides of the argument. \nLet's start with Williams, the more highly regarded of the two.One way Williams fits with the Brewers is his height: He is just 5'7\", so he'll fit right in with the likes of Caleb Durbin and Sal Frelick, two other diminutive recent prospect graduates. And, as you might expect, Williams doesn't hit the ball especially hard – in his brief Triple-A debut in 2025, he had just an 86 mph average exit velocity and 34% hard-hit rate, both of which were solidly below average marks. However, he manages to be functionally about average as a power hitter thanks to a strong approach at the plate and a high pulled-air rate, which helps him take advantage of the shorter fences in left field. The combination of solid contact skills and a proclivity for elevating the ball to the pull side should help him avoid being totally punchless, similar to how Durbin has emerged as a double-digit homer sources despite his diminutive size and exit velocity readings.Where my skepticism with Williams comes from is the plate discipline side. He tends to be overly passive, which leads to high walk rates in the minors but can be exploited in the majors. It's one thing if you just have preternaturally good swing decisions, but that isn't necessarily the case for Williams – at Triple-A, he was in the 78th percentile in chase rate, but was also in just the 27th percentile for in-zone swings. He lets a lot of strikes go past him searching for the right pitches he can drive, but major-league pitchers are much more willing and able to challenge hitters in the zone if they think they aren't going to hurt them. It's easy to fall behind with that approach. \nThat's not a death knell for Williams, but there just aren't a ton of players with below average pop who can make this kind of approach work. But there is one notable comp if you want to be optimistic: Geraldo Perdomo, who had below-average quality of contact metrics and the eighth-lowest in-zone swing rate in baseball in 2025, but made it work by making a ton of contact when he did swing, drawing a lot of walks when he didn't, and elevating the ball to the pull side and hitting a lot of line drives.Williams ranked 64th on Scott White's top-100 prospects list published earlier this week, and he had this to say: \"Williams bounced back nicely from an injury-wrecked 2024, particularly if you just look at his .281/.390/.477 slash line at Double-A and give him a pass for his bumpy transition to Triple-A. He still sells out harder for power than his 5-foot-7 frame suggests he should, though. There's a scrappy leadoff hitter in here -- one who's more likely to wind up at second base than shortstop -- but his current approach presents real batting average risk.\"\nThe Brewers have some depth up the middle, but shortstop is pretty clearly their biggest position of weakness with Joey Ortiz coming off a .593 OPS in 2025. They might prioritize Ortiz's steady glove hand in the short term, but if he hits like that again, Williams will have an opportunity to play before long, even if it doesn't seem super likely to come right out of Spring Training -- and Williams does have experience at second base and in the outfield, and flexibility always makes a path to playing time easier to find. And there is some power/speed upside here if he hits (Williams hit 17 homers and stole 34 bases in 130 games as a 21-year-old in 2025), too. Let's meet SproatSproat's value as a prospect has been on quite a ride in recent years, not unlike Williams. The former second-round pick garnered a lot of hype for his 2024 breakout, but he sputtered during a late callup to Triple-A and then nearly fell off prospect radars entirely when followed that up with a 5.43 ERA through the end of June to open 2025. But he switched up his approach, prioritized a sinker over his four-seamer and became a weak-contact inducing machine, posting a 2.72 ERA in July and August before a September promotion to the majors.Sproat held his own against big-leaguers, but some of the issues that cropped up early in the season came back. He struggled a bit with his command and didn't miss many bats, with his fastballs proving especially hittable. He has a deep arsenal and throws comfortably in the upper 90s, but Sproat's fastballs just aren't great, especially his four-seamer. He has struggled at times to maintain his velocity deep into games, too, presenting some real relief risk as he has grown up as a prospect.\nBut he racks up a lot of ground balls, has shown strikeout upside, and has had stretches of really good control before getting to Triple-A. It's not hard to see a solid major-leaguer here, but given that Sproat has been an older prospect and is already 25, I'm not sure there's a ton of upside here, either. Here's what Scott had to say about Sproat while ranking him as his No. 93 prospect: \"Sproat has fallen about 60 spots from last year's top 100, his ordinary fastball shape having been exposed with his move up to Triple-A, but he began emphasizing his sinker as the year went on and partially salvaged his stat line with a 2.44 ERA, 0.93 WHIP and 10.7 K/9 over his final 11 starts. He probably won't be much of a bat-misser at the highest level, which limits his ceiling, but he does excel at inducing weak grounders.\"There's a path for Sproat to make the Brewers rotation out of spring, but he's probably on the outside looking in for now. It's a nice landing spot on a team that tends to wring the most out of flawed young pitchers, and I could see Sproat having an outcome like Quinn Priester's, who emerged as a useful, albeit-kind-of-boring pitcher in 2025, with a 3.32 ERA but only 7.6 K/9. \nThat ain't nothing. But it's not something Fantasy players need to get excited about until we see some signs of success against major-league hitters. Sproat is pretty easy to pass on in 12-team leagues, and even in 15-teamers he probably shouldn't be drafted until we know he has a rotation spot. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fresh off the first losing season of the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes era, the Kansas City Chiefs are turning to a familiar face to help the team rebound in 2026. The Chiefs have agreed to terms with Eric Bieniemy to return as the team's offensive coordinator, CBS Sports' Jonathan Jones reports. Bieniemy, who spent the 2025 season as the running backs coach of the Chicago Bears, is replacing Matt Nagy, whose contract is set to expire and has been interviewing for other jobs around the league. Bieniemy, 56, helped the Chiefs win two Super Bowls during his five-year run as the team's offensive coordinator from 2018-22. During that time, the Chiefs boasted one of the NFL's most potent offenses, led by Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce. Kansas City continued to have success on offense even after former All-Pro receiver Tyreek Hill was traded to the Miami Dolphins after the 2021 season. Despite the Chiefs' success over that span, Bieniemy did not receive any serious consideration for available head-coaching positions at that time. Because of that, he accepted a lateral move to the Washington Commanders in 2023, allowing him to call plays. He lasted just one year in Washington as the team struggled through a 4-13 season. \nBieniemy then had a brief tenure as UCLA's associate head coach and offensive coordinator before landing in Chicago as part of Ben Johnson's initial staff. This season, the Bears finished third in the NFL in both rushing yards and third in average yards per carry as running backs D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai respectively ran for 1,087 and 783 yards and a combined 14 touchdowns. A former NFL running back, Bieniemy spent five years as a running backs coach in the college ranks before serving the same role with the Minnesota Vikings in 2006. During that time, he worked closely with Adrian Peterson, who was named to four straight Pro Bowls during his time with Bieniemy. Bieniemy served as the Chiefs' running backs coach for five years before being promoted to offensive coordinator in 2018, Mahomes' first season as the team's starting quarterback. That season, the Chiefs led the NFL in scoring while Mahomes threw a league-high 50 touchdowns. The Chiefs won their first of three Super Bowls over a five-year span the following season. \nThere are several questions surrounding the Chiefs entering the offseason with Mahomes coming off a torn ACL and Kelce mulling retirement. At least one question has now been answered with Bieniemy back in place orchestrating the offense alongside Reid. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Conference championship weekend is here. After 272 regular-season games and 10 postseason games, there are just three games left before we crown a Super Bowl champion in two weeks' time.With just four teams remaining in the playoffs and each one win away from a trip to Santa Clara to play for the Lombardi Trophy, it's of paramount importance to have each and every player available.Of course, we already know that won't be the case for multiple teams. The Denver Broncos will be without starting quarterback Bo Nix after he suffered an ankle fracture during the Divisional Round win over the Buffalo Bills, and the Seattle Seahawks will be without running back Zach Charbonnet after he tore his ACL during the win over the San Francisco 49ers.As for the rest of the players dealing with injuries this week, see below for the initial practice reports for each team.New England Patriots (-4.5) at Denver BroncosSunday, 3 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nPatriots: New England listed both Harold Landry III (knee) and Marte Mapu (hip) as not practicing Wednesday. Meanwhile, Carlton Davis (concussion protocol), Christian Elliss (hip), Thayer Munford Jr. (knee), Hunter Henry (rest) and Morgan Moses (rest) were listed as limited. Joshua Farmer (hamstring), TreVeyon Henderson (shoulder), Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol) and Robert Spillane (hand) were listed on the report but practiced in full. New England could have some issues on defense if Landry, Mapu, Davis and Elliss are unable to go Sunday.Broncos: Bo Nix (ankle) did not practice for Denver. J.K. Dobbins (foot) was limited, as were Troy Franklin (hamstring), Pat Bryant (concussion protocol) and Alex Forsyth (ankle). Frank Crum (ankle), Lucas Krull (foot), Drew Sanders (ankle), JL Skinner (quad) and Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) were on the report but were full participants. Jarrett Stidham will start in Nix's place. The Broncos could be whole in the backfield with Dobbins potentially returning, but their receiver corps could take a hit if Franklin and Bryant can't get back in the lineup.\n        \n            \n                Jarrett Stidham hopes to join Nick Foles, Tom Brady, Kurt Warner, other backup QBs to start in a Super Bowl\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nRams: Quentin Lake (illness) and Byron Young (knee) did not practice. Emmanuel Forbes (shoulder) was limited. Josaiah Stewart (knee) was listed but practiced in full. The Rams are pretty healthy but could have some defensive issues, particularly in the secondary, if things don't progress.\nSeahawks: Charles Cross (foot), Josh Jones (knee/ankle) and Amari Knight (knee) did not practice for Seattle. Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited, as were Bryce Cabeldue (knee), Demarcus Lawrence (rest), Uchenna Nwosu (hamstring), Robbie Ouzts (neck), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (rest) and Leonard Williams (rest). Elijah Arroyo (knee) returned to full participation but was listed on the report, as were George Holani (hamstring), Tyrice Knight (shoulder) and Chazz Surratt (ankle). Seattle could have some offensive line issues if Cross and Jones can't go. Darnold played through his injury last week.\n            ",

You can find all the action on Paramount+ as the top 24 teams will be decided, with eight teams heading home. Only Arsenal and Bayern Munich have clinched their places in the round of 16, but the top spot of the league phase is up for grabs. There are also nine spots in the knockout stages to be clinched on the final day of action, and it's anyone's guess who will secure them.  Four teams have been eliminated from contention for the knockouts in Eintracht Frankfurt, Slavia Prague, Villarreal, and Kairat Almaty, but there's a pretty big team on the outside looking in as things stand. Antonio Conte's Napoli, the reigning Scudetto holders in Italy, would be out of the Champions League if things ended today. Luckily, that's not the case, but with a looming date with Chelsea on the horizon, Napoli must win to make the knockouts, and even if they do, they'll still need help.  But what does every team need on the final day of action? \n Tiebreakers If teams are level on points following the end of the league phase, this is how tiebreakers will be applied: Overall goal differenceGoals scored in all league matchesAway goals scored in all league matchesTotal winsAway winsStrength of schedule, includes points, goal difference and goals scored of all opponents faced in league phaseFewer disciplinary points, one point for a yellow card, three points for a red card, and three points for two yellow cardsHigher overall ranking in the UEFA Club Coefficient Arsenal Points: 18Goal difference: +18Remaining game: Kairat (h)Can clinch top spot in the league phase with: At least a point in their final match, or Bayern Munich dropping points.

    "body": "\n        If the Denver Broncos are going to play for a Super Bowl, it will be without quarterback Bo Nix, who recently underwent ankle surgery following his season-ending injury during the final moments of Denver's AFC divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills. As his team prepares for Sunday's AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, Nix summed up his emotions in a lengthy Instagram post. Nix called the injury \"some of the most devastating football news\" he's ever received. And while he is struggling with the notion of not being on the field with his teammates, Nix is confident the Broncos are still capable of winning with backup Jarrett Stidham leading the offense. The last few days have been hard to put into words. What started as one of the most exciting games I've ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I've ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it. I can't express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them. I couldn't be more proud of our guys. I couldn't be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn't be more excited for what's next. Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me. God never says oops, and he is always good. He has big plans for this team. We're not finished, as a matter of fact we're just getting started. We're just going to keep climbing higher. Go Broncos.Nix's injury halted what would have been an intriguing showdown between two of the league's rising young quarterbacks with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye on the other sideline. Members of the 2024 NFL Draft class, Maye and Nix have enjoyed fast starts to their careers. Nix helped the Broncos snap their 10-year drought without a playoff appearance as a rookie. This past Sunday, he led Denver to its first postseason victory since its win over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50. \nWhile his team didn't have much success in 2024, Maye did earn Pro Bowl honors after completing an impressive 66.6% of his passes. This year, he led the NFL with a 72% completion percentage while leading the Patriots to their first 14-win season since 2016.  \nWhile Nix and Maye won't get the chance to match wits on Sunday, there is another point of intrigue in Stidham trying to join the surprisingly long list of backup quarterbacks who have led their teams to the big game. That list includes Jeff Hostetler, the former New York Giants quarterback who helped Bill Parcells win his fourth Super Bowl with Big Blue. \nBroncos coach Sean Payton -- a Parcells disciple -- is hoping to emulate his former boss by becoming the latest coach to win it all with a backup quarterback.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Floor-spacing centers are reshaping modern offenses, and their willingness to fire from deep is creating new wrinkles for fantasy basketball managers. As three-point volume rises among big men, fantasy basketball stats no longer come strictly from the paint, forcing managers to rethink player rankings and category balance. This article breaks down the 10 centers attempting the most three-pointers per game, highlighting who is thriving as a true stretch option and who may be sacrificing rebounds, efficiency or interior production.Naz Reid, TimberwolvesReid has been among the league's leading centers in three-point attempts per game for a few seasons now. He is pacing the league for a second consecutive campaign, with 6.3 long-range attempts per game. He has also improved his distance shooting over the last three seasons, with a career-best 41.4 percent shooting from deep in 2023-24, and he is currently hitting 38.8 percent from deep, which marks the second-best rate of his career. Additionally, this is the second straight year that he is averaging a minimum of 6.0 rebounds per game, as he is on pace for a career high with 6.2 per game. Myles Turner, BucksTurner ranks second among centers with a career-high 5.8 three-point attempts per game and is shooting 39.0 percent from deep, which is just a sliver below his career-high of 39.6 percent from last season. However, his increased shooting volume from long range is dragging down his overall field-goal percentage, as he is sitting at a career-low 42.1 percent shooting from the field, which is more than three percent worse than his previous low. His rebounding is also at a career-low 5.3 boards per game, while his 1.5 blocks per game are on pace for the second fewest of his career. Nikola Jokic, NuggetsJokic (knee) has been sidelined since December 29 but is on track in his recovery and could return to action in the next couple of weeks. He ranks third in the league with a career-high 4.8 three-point attempts per game and is shooting a blistering career high of 43.5 percent from long range. The incredible shooting combined with his creativity and dominance in the paint have been an impossible combination for opponents for years now. The three-time MVP continues to push the limits of productivity, averaging a triple-double for a second consecutive season after becoming the first center to ever do so last season. \nKarl-Anthony Towns, KnicksTowns also averages 4.8 three-point attempts per game, but it is not a career high for him, as he has had four seasons shooting over five threes per game. Meanwhile, he is knocking down just 35.8 percent from deep, which is his lowest mark since his rookie season. His struggles are not only from deep, as he is shooting 46.7 percent from the field, which is a career low. On the other hand, he continues to do a great job on the glass and acts as a solid distributor with 3.0 assists per game. Nikola Vucevic, BullsVucevic attempts 4.7 three-pointers per game and is making an average of 1.7, while knocking down 37.1 percent from beyond the arc. This marks the fourth time in 15 seasons that he is shooting better than 37 percent from deep, and he is on pace to shoot better than 50 percent from the field for a third time in four seasons. On the other hand, he is lagging in terms of his rebounding, averaging fewer than 10 per game for the first time in eight seasons. Quinten Post, WarriorsPost is averaging almost identical numbers to his rookie season with 8.1 points, 4.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 0.5 blocks per game. However, his three-point shooting is down 5.7 percent in efficiency compared to last season, as he is hitting just 35.1 percent of his 4.5 shots from deep. His ability to stretch the floor is certainly a notable part of his role, but the second-year big man needs to find a few more ways to contribute in order to break through into a larger role in the rotation. \nBrook Lopez, ClippersLopez was never a dominant rebounder despite his size and role at the center position, but he has always been able to provide enough scoring and shot-blocking to remain a positive contributor. He  also did well to morph himself into a three-point specialist about nine seasons ago and has not looked back since, on track to average at least 4.0 three-point attempts per game for a 10th straight season. He is in a significantly reduced role, averaging just 17.0 minutes per game in his first campaign with the Clippers, which may also be making it tougher to find a rhythm, as his current 32.3 percent shooting from deep is his second-lowest mark in 10 seasons. Jay Huff, PacersHuff averages 4.4 three-point attempts per game, which ranks eighth among centers, but his 32.1 percent success rate ranks lowest among the players on this list. Nonetheless, his skill in stretching the floor has been helpful for the Pacers in terms of filling a void in offense after the departure of Myles Turner. Huff also does a great job on the defensive side, averaging 2.1 blocks per game, which is second most in the league. His 3.8 rebounds per game leaves something to be desired but is not overly lacking due to his limited average of 20.0 minutes per game.Bam Adebayo, HeatAdebayo is having a less-than-impressive start to the season, with his averages down nearly across the board, including his field-goal percentage sitting at a career-low 44.5 percent. Part of the dip is surely since he is shooting a career-high 4.3 threes per game, up from 2.8 last season. However, his three-point shooting percentage is holding up at 35.9, suggesting that it is the other areas of his offense that are struggling in their own right. The Heat's continued injury trouble with playmakers in the backcourt could also be affecting the way that he is able to fit into the offense. \nEvan Mobley, CavaliersMobley is another big name that is arguably falling short of many expectations, as his numbers are  down in the scoring and rebounding columns. Still, he continues to step up defensively with a career-high 1.9 blocks per game. The reigning Defensive Player of the Year is also showing growth on the other side of his game with a career-high 3.7 three-point attempts per game, of which he is knocking down 32.6 percent. His increased three-point shooting is surely contributing to a dip in his overall field-goal percentage, but the added long-range threat can also be valuable in the dynamics of the squad's offense. \n            ",

Flores was on an expiring contract after serving as Minnesota's defensive coordinator for the past three seasons and recently interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers for their head jobs. If he's not hired to lead one of those teams, Flores will return to the Vikings.\"Brian has a unique ability to connect with players, understand their skill sets, and put them in positions to maximize their impact on the field,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said. \"The identity of our defense is a reflection of his leadership and preparation. On a personal level, I've really valued the relationship we've built over the last three years, and that shared trust, alignment and high standard will continue to be critical to our success.\"Flores, 44, spent 15 seasons on Bill Belichick's staff with the New England Patriots. He won four Super Bowls with the Patriots, including one as the team's de facto defensive coordinator. Flores was credited with helping the Patriots hold the Rams to just three points in Super Bowl LIII. \nFlores parlayed his success in New England into his first head coaching opportunity with the Miami Dolphins, who hired him ahead of the 2019 season. After losing his first seven games in Miami, Flores guided the Dolphins to five wins in their final nine games. He was fired two years later despite leading the Dolphins to back-to-back winning seasons. Shortly after his firing, Flores sued the NFL, the Dolphins, New York Giants and Denver Broncos alleging racial discrimination. He then spent one season with the Pittsburgh Steelers as linebackers coach before becoming the Vikings' defensive coordinator. \nFlores was added to O'Connell's staff in Minnesota ahead of the 2023 season. In 2024, his defense finished fifth in the NFL in points allowed as the Vikings went 14-3 during the regular season. The Vikings allowed the seventh-fewest points in the league in 2025. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason continues to wind down, with just three weeks remaining until pitchers and catchers report for camp across sites in Arizona and Florida. That doesn't mean teams can just take it easy until then, however, since several top free agents remain unsigned, including left-hander Framber Valdez and outfielder Cody Bellinger. Below, CBS Sports has compiled all of Wednesday's most notable murmurs and moves in one spot for your convenience.Mets, Brewers talking Peralta trade\nThe Mets in Brewers are in talks about a trade that would send ace Freddy Peralta to New York, Jon Heyman of the New York Post reports. Now 29, Peralta is one of only 11 pitchers to make at least 30 starts in each of the last three seasons, and he's also notched three straight seasons of at least 200 strikeouts. With an $8 million salary for 2026, his walk year, he's also a massive bargain from the club standpoint. The Mets have had a fairly active winter, but they still need a frontline presence in the rotation. Peralta would certainly meet that need. The Peralta negotiations come after the Mets and White Sox agreed to a three-player swap late Tuesday night headlined by outfielder Luis Robert Jr. In return, the White Sox acquired utility player Luisangel Acuña and right-handed pitching prospect Truman Pauley.\nThe Mets have had a busy winter overall, adding Robert, Bo Bichette, Marcus Semien, Jorge Polanco, and others while bidding adieu to mainstays like Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil, Brandon Nimmo, and Edwin Díaz.Cardinals interested in outfielderCount the Cardinals among the clubs to show interest in veteran outfielder Austin Hays, per the New York Post. Hays, 30, spent last season with the Reds. In 103 games, he batted .266/.315/.453 (105 OPS+) with 15 home runs and seven stolen bases. Throughout his career, he's been more effective against left-handed pitchers, posting an .819 OPS with the platoon advantage (as opposed to a .717 mark without). \nThat platoon split makes Hays a sensible target for a Cardinals roster that, as of the moment, features several left-handed outfielders and corner players, including Alec Burleson and Lars Nootbaar. In addition to the Cardinals, Hays has been linked to the Yankees (who just re-signed Cody Bellinger), Mets, and other clubs throughout the offseason.Twins, Red Sox make tradeThe Twins have acquired infielder Tristan Gray from the Red Sox in exchange for minor-league catcher Nate Baez, the teams announced Wednesday morning.\nGray, 29, has appeared in 47 big-league games to date in his career, most recently appearing in 30 contests with the Rays in 2025. Although he's only posted a 77 OPS+, he has shown a feel for making authoritative contact, as demonstrated by his 46.8% hard-hit percentage. (The league-average is around 40%.) He figures to compete for playing time on the Minnesota infield.Baez, 24, hit .278/.371/.423 in 96 games last year across High- and Double-A. He's a former 12th-round pick by way of Arizona State University. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. women's national team closed out 2025 on a high with a 2-0 win over Italy on Monday, the performance showcasing the progress the group has made since head coach Emma Hayes began a year-long experimentation period as she rebuilds the team with the 2027 Women's World Cup in mind.Three days removed from a 3-0 win over the same opponent, Hayes made five changes to the lineup that started on Friday and reaped the rewards for her selections in more ways than one. Fresh off bagging a brace in their previous meeting against Italy, Catarina Macario scored the USWNT's opener in the 20th minute. Lily Yohannes expertly saw Macario running into space and made the pass from the halfway line, with Macario meeting the ball before making a long run into the box and putting a curled shot into the back of the net.\nThe USWNT doubled their lead in the 41st minute through Jaedyn Shaw, who connected with Alyssa Thompson for the goal. Thompson spotted Shaw and played a long pass through traffic to her teammate, with Shaw eventually making her way to the edge of the penalty area before slotting the ball past Italy goalkeeper Francesca Durante.\nMuch like they did three days earlier, the USWNT were dominant in possession but created fewer meaningful goalscoring opportunities along the way, their shot count dropping from 19 on Friday to 16 on Monday. The U.S. also posted just 1.44 expected goals on Monday, their second-lowest total all year long, though they effectively shut Italy completely out of the game. Italy mustered 1.21 expected goals from seven chances on Friday and became the latest team to expose the USWNT's shakiness when defending set pieces but on Monday, the visitors had just 0.31 expected goals from six shots.\nThe USWNT return to play in the new year with a friendly against Paraguay on Jan. 24, the latest step in the team's progression to the Concacaf W Championship in November, which will serve as the qualification tournament for the 2027 World Cup.The USWNT's stacked attackMacario and Shaw were the latest players to have their moment in the sun in a year full of them for the USWNT's young stars, each of them translating their strong club form to the national team. Chelsea's Macario now has seven goals and three assists in her last 14 matches for club and country, while Shaw has three goals and one assist in her last five, playing a major role in Gotham's run to the NWSL Championship. Their outings offer a stark reminder that Hayes treats club form as foundational in earning a call-up to the national team, the pair continuing to live up to the hype as important new additions to a USWNT attack that has historically been the team's defining aspect.For Macario in particular, the games against Italy have finally allowed the attacker to live up to her promise after several injury-plagued years. She boasts a versatility that makes her an easy addition to any USWNT roster but Hayes has frequently deputized her as a No. 9, which may be her role with the team going forward. Alongside the likes of Shaw and Alyssa Thompson, who also started on Monday, Macario helps to quash any concerns about the USWNT's depth in attack. Hayes has had to spend the vast majority of 2025 without the triple espresso of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson, who combined for 10 goals during the team's gold medal-winning run at the 2024 Olympic Games. The USWNT have not missed the trio all that much, setting up for a competitive race for roster spots and playing time as the World Cup nears.\nThe USWNT's year of opportunityHayes now has 30 matches under her belt as the USWNT head coach and has handed starts to 50 different players along the way, the most of anyone in her position during that stretch of games. The player pool is as wide-open as it has ever been as a result, meaning the race for minutes will not be exclusive to the attacking positions.The head coach will now spend much of 2026 locking in her top choices for different roles, though it seems like a few players are inching closer to starting roles than others. The goalkeeper position just might be down to two players in Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Claudia Dickey, with Dickey starting both games against Italy while Tullis-Joyce battles a fractured eye socket. Naomi Girma still has a hold on a starting position as a center back, while the USWNT are better when 18-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes is on the field.Many of the other positions seem to be up for grabs, either waiting for a player recovering from a long-term injury or on the way back from maternity leave or paving the way for an up-and-comer to assume the role. Each and every friendly en route to the Concacaf W Championship in November will essentially be an audition for those spots but one thing feels certain – Hayes' version of the team already looks vastly different than the one she inherited, at the very least proving that the U.S. team has the depth needed to make deep runs in major tournaments.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Florida athletic director Scott Sricklin introduced Jon Sumrall as the school's next football coach on Monday. And after that introduction was made, Stricklin spent a bulk of time answering questions about the candidate who did not accept the job. We, of course, would be talking about Lane Kiffin.The Gators' interest in Kiffin was no secret, but the two sides never came to an agreement, and Kiffin was introduced as the new LSU coach shortly after Sumrall took the podium in Gainesville. Stricklin admitted he didn't know why Kiffin turned down the Florida job but felt like they had some \"productive conversations\" throughout the process.\"He's a fascinating guy, and I respect his decision,\" Stricklin said, per The Independent Florida Alligator. \"I don't know why he made the decision he did, but, I would say we had productive conversations.\"Stricklin denied the rumors that he and Kiffin didn't mesh well in interviews, saying that there is a lot of \"false information\" going around about the coaching search.\"There's a lot of twisted information, and a lot of people trying to create narratives that benefit themselves,\" Stricklin said. \"And so look, I said earlier, I'm not gonna talk about any other candidates, but Lane was a pretty visible candidate.\"\nCBS Sports' own John Talty chronicled the chaos that was the Kiffin courtship by Florida, LSU and Ole Miss. In that article, Talty reports that initial talks between Kiffin and Stricklin weren't exactly smooth. Part of the disconnect was Florida's insistence on having a general manager who would report directly to the next coach.\n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUltimately, Kiffin passed on the opportunity to coach the Gators and wound up in Baton Rouge. Stricklin was pleased that Florida ended up where it did -- with Sumrall in charge after another great season at the Group of Five level. Stricklin also said he holds no ill will toward other parties involved in the process.\"I'm really happy with where we are,\" Stricklin said. \"I wish him the best. I wish all the schools involved the best, except for when we play them.\"\nWhen it became clearer that Kiffin was leaning away from Florida, Stricklin said he knew the Gators had to act fast because there would be \"a line out the door\" for Sumrall, who came recommended by Urban Meyer. Auburn was reportedly interested in Sumrall, but Florida was able to lure him away from Tulane after pivoting away from Kiffin.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The latest CBA proposal from the Women's National Basketball Association to the WNBA Players Association includes a maximum base salary of $1 million in 2026, a source with knowledge of the situation told CBS Sports on Monday. The proposal -- which comes after the two sides recently agreed to a 40-day extension of the current CBA -- also includes a minimum salary of more than $225,000 and would bump the league's salary cap to $5 million in Year 1 of the new deal. The WNBA's minimum salary and salary cap were $66,079 and $1.5 million in the 2025 season, respectively.The supermax in 2025 was $249,244. The league's proposal would push the max salary to seven figures and that number could be more than $1.2 million based on projected revenue sharing, per sources.Meanwhile, the league's proposal would see the salary cap rise to $5 million in Year 1, and it would be tied directly to revenue growth in each year of the CBA.\nPlayer salaries figure to increase substantially in whatever deal is eventually reached between the WNBA and the players. The players, however, have voiced that changing the revenue-sharing model is a top priority in the new CBA. Here's more from CBS Sports' Jack Maloney:While the players want more money, a new revenue-sharing model is their top priority, not just higher salaries. \"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share [and] salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has not yet been a public response from the players union regarding the league's latest proposal. \nSunday's 40-day extension of the current CBA keeps it intact through Jan. 9, 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in their long and celebrated careers, Dick Vitale and Charles Barkley will share the broadcast booth for an NCAA Tournament game, bringing together more than 100 years of combined basketball experience. The pairing will call a First Four matchup as part of CBS Sports and TNT Sports' coverage.Before that, the duo will make their regular-season broadcast debut for No. 22 Indiana at No. 17 Kentucky on Saturday, Dec. 13 on ESPN. Vitale's presence in the booth is particularly notable given his recent health journey. The Hall of Fame broadcaster, 86, revealed in September that he is currently cancer-free following a PET scan. Over the past four years, Vitale has faced multiple diagnoses, including melanoma, lymphoma and laryngeal cancer, each successfully treated.Vitale returned to broadcasting earlier this year, courtside for then-No. 2 Duke's matchup against Clemson -- his first on-air assignment in 22 months. He has called more than 1,000 games in his career, becoming one of the most enduring and beloved voices in college basketball.\nBarkley, an award-winning analyst on TNT's Inside the NBA for 25 years, brings a contrasting style to Vitale's high-energy, storytelling-driven approach. The combination of Vitale's passion and Barkley's candid insight promises to deliver a broadcast filled with personality, humor and basketball expertise.\"Dick has meant so much to the game of basketball, and we have long felt he deserved an opportunity to call an NCAA Men's Tournament game, and we are delighted he has finally agreed following several offers,\" said Harold Bryant, CBS Sports' executive producer and executive vice president for production. \"Having him call the game with Charles will be must-see TV and a great way to tip off the First Four.\"\nThe First Four pairing gives fans a rare chance to see two legends of the game together, blending decades of experience, perspective and plenty of personality. While the matchups themselves carry high stakes for the teams involved, Vitale and Barkley's presence ensures the broadcast will be just as memorable for the commentary off the court as the action on it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Ryder Cup didn't end up as a lopsided defeat for the United States, thanks to a wild Sunday surge in singles. That was too little too late, considering Europe had built up a massive lead over the first two days to become the first team to win an away Ryder Cup since 2012. There was no shortage of blame passed around after the U.S. side fell short at home, and captain Keegan Bradley bore the brunt of it, especially when it came to complaints about the course setup at Bethpage BlackKnown as one of golf's toughest tests, Bethpage Black was neutered by a decision to cut down the rough. Rain early in the week softened the greens, and the Europeans crushed the Americans across the first two days thanks to a red-hot putting display on greens that lacked the fire most expected. That was apparently a point of contention between the U.S. team and the greens staff at Bethpage Black, and the greens were noticeably quicker on Sunday when the Americans made their charge. Bradley was largely blamed for specifying how the green should run, but Justin Thomas confirmed that the course staff and the U.S. team argued over the green speeds through the week during a recent appearance on the No Laying Up podcast.\n\"I don't know why they weren't at all what Keegan had asked for,\" Thomas said. \"I mean, he had been pretty clear of asking for a certain speed and wanting it fast enough. I watched them argue with us that they were 13s [on the Stimpmeter]. It's like, 'Guys, we play golf every week, like, look on TV at how many guys are leaving putts short. Nobody is getting ... You can't have a putt roll 3-4 feet past the hole. Like, these greens are slow. Speed them up.'\"\"It was just bizarre because that's not something you would expect at a home Ryder Cup. And again, that's not an excuse. They had to adjust to them just as much as we did,\" Thomas added. \"But that's kind of a fun advantage you generally have is being able to [set up the course] a little bit, and it was just so frustrating that we were being fought with and argued with on the speed of the greens that we asked for. So that was bizarre.\"To Thomas' point, none of this is an excuse for the Americans' poor performance on Friday and Saturday. Still, it is certainly not the situation a team wants to experience when choosing the course setup is supposed to be one of the main advantages for the home side. \nThat will be something the PGA of America will have to address ahead the next Ryder Cup staged stateside, as the course staff must be willing to adapt if the greens aren't where the team wants them. Perhaps they were rolling 13 on the Stimpmeter, but if the team says they need to be faster, then you have to try everything you can to speed them up rather than pushing back. At the same time, the U.S. side must be able to adjust and perform better, even if they aren't getting the exact conditions they wanted. Softer greens are harder to speed up, and with the rain that the course took on the week of the Ryder Cup, the U.S. team had to play better in the conditions that confronted them. While cutting down the rough was an own goal by Bradley, the way the greens played was perhaps not his fault after all.\n            ",

Herbert is considered day-to-day, and his status for the Week 14 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night is to be determined. Herbert injured his hand on the Chargers' opening drive, which was capped by a 10-yard Quentin Johnston touchdown. The star signal-caller hurt his hand after taking a big hit from Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn, but he appeared to be OK. \nFollowing the opening scoring drive, Herbert exited the sideline and jogged to the locker room. Trey Lance took over at quarterback on L.A.'s next drive. When Herbert returned to the game that very same drive, he sported a large protective glove. \nHerbert completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception vs. the Raiders, and passed Dan Marino for the third-most passing yards (23,935) in a quarterback's first six seasons in NFL history. Los Angeles relied on its rushing attack Sunday, as Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson combined for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. Herbert told reporters he's treating this week as if he's playing, per ESPN. He will surely be pushing to play, and will need to wear a protective device on that injured hand, but it's possible Lance could make his first start for L.A. in Week 14.\nThe former No. 3 overall pick of the San Francisco 49ers made one start for the Dallas Cowboys last year, a 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders in which he completed 20 of 34 passes for 244 yards. Lance is 2-3 in his career as a starter. \n            \n    ",

In an interview before he hopped on the plane to Baton Rouge, Kiffin credited mentor Pete Carroll, whom he coached under at USC, with encouraging him to leave for the Tigers. But during his introductory press conference at LSU on Monday, Kiffin revealed that none other than Nick Saban also had a huge hand in the process. \"Coach Saban kind of coached at another place in this conference so I can't really say exactly what he said,\" Kiffin said. \"I will say, I think the world of coach Saban and I respect him. So there's a reason I'm here.\" \n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSaban won a national title at LSU before a brief foray in the NFL gave way to his legendary career at Alabama, where he spent 17 seasons from 2007-23. Kiffin was his offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2014-16. The two won three consecutive SEC titles and one national title together. \nThough he had the support he needed to make the move to LSU, Kiffin noted that it wasn't an easy process. He had several meetings with Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter and the university's administration in the hours before he made his final decision. Kiffin doubled down on the claim that, in spite of the fact that he had player support after a team meeting Sunday morning, Ole Miss determined that he would not coach in the Rebels' expected College Football Playoff appearance. According to Kiffin, the timing of Ole Miss' decision also prevented him from telling the team that he was leaving. None of that deterred Kiffin, who made his final announcement via social media Sunday. \n\"I hate that I didn't get to explain to the players why,\" Kiffin said. \"But I also totally respect and understand the decision they felt they had to make for the program.\" He left for Baton Rouge the same day. Kiffin, who agreed to a seven-year, $91 million contract, had to contact a police officer that he knew to guide him and his son to the airport, where Ole Miss fans met him with boos and middle fingers. \"That airport scene, and all the things being said, I understand it's the passion,\" Kiffin said. \"But they're saying that about you and you thought you did a really good job for six years for them. That affects you.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Penn State is targeting BYU's Kalani Sitake to fill its coaching vacancy, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. The Nittany Lions' brass turned their attention toward Sitake to replace James Franklin, who was fired Oct. 12, six games into his 12th season on the job. The news of Penn State's pursuit of Sitake comes ahead of No. 11 BYU's showdown with No. 5 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game -- a matchup with a College Football Playoff bid on the line. Sitake, 50, has served as BYU's coach since 2016 and guided the program's transition from the independent ranks to the Big 12. The Cougars have a combined 22-3 record over the past two seasons, including an 11-1 (8-1 Big 12) mark heading into Saturday's conference title game. Sitake has an 83-44 overall record at his alma mater and the Cougars have reached the 10-win mark in four of his 10 seasons on the job. Sitake was asked about the Penn State job on Monday, but declined to answer directly. \n\"We're trying to finish the season the right way, it's on us to be our best to play against Texas Tech,\" Sitake said. \"So as we go through this week and go through the prep, I also want them to live through all the moments and have a great experience and not waste a moment thinking about anything else. ... This is a great distraction to have, let's be honest. But you know, right now we need to be focused on making sure that we're giving our best shot in this game against Texas Tech.\"If it lands Sitake, Penn State gets an experienced coach to succeed Franklin, who was hired by Virginia Tech just weeks after being fired. Penn State began the season ranked No. 2 on the heels of a trip to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season, but sputtered to a 3-3 start with losses to Oregon, UCLA and Northwestern. Penn State athletic director Patrick Kraft fired Franklin a day after the home loss to Northwestern. \n        \n            \n                Kalani Sitake to Penn State? BYU coach addresses job rumors ahead of Big 12 Championship Game\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPenn State won the Big Ten in 2016, played in seven New Year's Six bowl games and reached the 10-win mark six times under Franklin, but could never quite get over the hump while struggling mightily in games against top competition (Franklin was 2-21 vs. top 10 opponents), notably conference rivals Ohio State and Michigan. \nKraft has identified Sitake as the coach to push Penn State into national championship contention. But is he a fit in Happy Valley? Sitake has never coached outside the Mountain or Pacific time zones and was widely viewed as a BYU lifer, tied to the program culturally and personally in ways few Power Four coaches are to their schools. He played at BYU under LaVell Edwards and remains deeply connected to its identity as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But with Penn State's position in the Big Ten and access to greater resources and the College Football Playoff, Sitake may opt to make the move East. Penn State played out the season under interim coach Terry Smith. Smith, a Penn State alum and longtime assistant under Franklin, publicly campaigned for the job while leading the Nittany Lions to a 3-3 record, including wins in its final three games to get to 6-6 and bowl eligibility. \n            ",

However, Carter entered the game in the second quarter, and recorded his first career sack on Drake Maye. In Week 11, Carter was held out for the opening series vs. the Green Bay Packers. It was reported that the rookie was benched for sleeping through a walkthrough. Carter said this was untrue, and that a schedule change led to his confusion. He claimed he was getting treatment at the time he should have been at practice. \"My mistake was an honest mistake,\" Carter told ESPN. \"I own the fact that it was an honest mistake. I was getting treatment and I told Coach Kafka that, too. But to say I was sleeping at that time just wasn't true. And it also wasn't a trend. This was the only time it happened.\"\nIn 12 games played this season with two starts, Carter has recorded 27 tackles, 12 QB hits and one fumble recovery. Considered to be one of the best players in the 2025 NFL Draft, Carter became the third Penn State defensive player to be selected in the top three in the common draft era. He recorded 12 sacks and 24 tackles for loss in his final collegiate season, making him the first FBS player to reach both of those marks since former Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr. did so in 2021. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin's turbulent departure from Ole Miss to become LSU's new coach has drawn the ire of many, including Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher. Cowher and the rest of the \"NFL Today\" crew took time out of their Week 13 coverage to address Kiffin's controversial exit. They reacted to his comments that he asked -- and was denied -- the chance to coach Ole Miss during its upcoming College Football Playoff run. Kiffin also allegedly gave his former coaches at Ole Miss an ultimatum to either leave with him this past weekend or lose the opportunity to join his new staff at LSU. \"I would say, why would you even ask that question?\" Cowher said in response to Kiffin's request to continue coaching Ole Miss for the remainder of its season. \"Why would an AD let a coach -- who made a decision that he wanted to go to LSU and not stay at Ole Miss -- coach my players and use my coaches and tell them for the next month why they should be joining him at LSU. Totally understand. I would just say, 'Thank you Lane, and goodbye.'\" Cowher also offered his two cents to any player who choose to play for Kiffin in the future. \n\"Just understand one thing: it's not about the program, it's about Lane Kiffin,\" Cowher said. \"Because he doesn't care about the players that he just went through a season with, a special season. Players he's had for four years with an opportunity to go to the playoffs. He's decided to only leave them, which I get. Okay, you want to do that, but now you take offensive coaches with you and destroy the program. Deplete the program and the dreams of these young men who you said that you want to be there and you want to do it with, but if I can't do it, I'm not going to let you do you it yourself.\" Cowher made it clear that he doesn't have an issue with Kiffin pursuing another opportunity. It's the way that he left that bothers Cowher and many other people for that matter. \"If you go, then go and wish them nothing but the best,\" Cowher said. \"Don't disrupt that program. Don't take any of those coaches. Let them stay there and let them finish the job that you left because you didn't want to finish it, because you decided you want to go somewhere else. That's fine. But don't take everybody else with you and try to destroy that program.  \n\"A football program is not just about the head coach. It's about the assistants. It's about the organization. It's about everybody else. Administrative staff that sat there and supported you all those years, all those alumni that sat there gave you money for NIL, it's about them too. You've left them. And so it isn't just about you, Lane Kiffin.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kentucky is expected to hire Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein to be its next head coach, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reports. The move comes hours after the Wildcats fired all-time wins leader Mark Stoops.The move to Lexington would be Stein's first head-coaching job and represent the latest step in what has been a rapid rise for the 36-year-old Kentucky native. Stein spent 2008-12 as a quarterback at Louisville, appearing in 25 games for the Cardinals. He then spent two seasons on the Louisville staff, was with Texas as a quality control coach from 2015-17 and coached at Lake Travis High School in Texas -- a longtime powerhouse program -- in 2018 and 2019. Among the players under his tutelage was future Ohio State star and current New York Jets receiver Garrett Wilson.\n        \n            \n                Inside Oregon offensive coordinator Will Stein's rise from Friday nights in Texas to the national spotlight\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nStein then took the passing game coordinator and wide receiver coach roles at UTSA and was promoted to be the Roadrunners' co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach ahead of the 2022 season.UTSA produced one of college football's best offensive attacks, finishing 12th in yards per game and 15th in points per game. In December 2022, Dan Lanning hired Stein to become Oregon's offensive coordinator, a role vacated by Kenny Dillingham when he took the Arizona State job.The fit was an instant success. The Ducks scored a modern era program-record 81 points against Portland State in Stein's first game as offensive coordinator and averaged 43.7 points per game that season, second in FBS behind LSU. In 2024, the Ducks were the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff before losing to Ohio State. Overall, Oregon's offense has averaged 37.7 points per game over the past three seasons, second in FBS behind North Texas. The Ducks' 7.1 yards per play is first nationally.\nStein has shown a propensity to adapt to different quarterbacks well. In 2023, he helped Bo Nix take a massive leap; Nix completed an FBS record 77.4% of his passes and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting. Last year, Dillon Gabriel led the Ducks' attack, and this year, it's been Dante Moore. With Moore leading the offense, Oregon finished the regular season 11-1 and will likely host a first-round College Football Playoff game. Stein is expected to continue to call plays for the Ducks through their CFP run, per ESPN's Pete Thamel.Kentucky fired Stoops shortly after a 41-0 loss to Louisville; the Wildcats finished 5-7 and missed a bowl for the second straight year after making a bowl in each of the eight seasons prior. Kentucky's 20.7 points per game over the past two seasons rank last in the SEC, as do its 335.8 yards per game.At 9-15 (3-13 SEC) over the past two seasons, Stoops was mired in his worst run since taking over the job from Joker Phillips after the 2012 season. His final record of 82-80 (38-68 SEC) is heavily weighed down by a slow beginning and poor ending. In between came some of the program's finest moments. It took four seasons for UK to reach a bowl under Stoops, but 2016 marked the first of eight straight postseason trips for the Wildcats. \nStoops produced the program's first 10-win season since 1977 in 2018 and did it again in 2021 before a downward trend began, ultimately leading to Stoops' dismissal and the impending arrival of Stein. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State is hiring Pat Fitzgerald to fill its coaching vacancy, the university announced Monday. The Spartans acted quickly to replace former coach Jonathan Smith, who was fired Sunday afternoon after two seasons in East Lansing. Fitzgerald was initially reported as a top target in Michigan State's search. This will mark a return to the Big Ten for the 50-year-old coach, who spent 17 seasons at Northwestern from 2006-22. He has not coached at the collegiate level since. \"I am honored to be named the head football coach at Michigan State University,\" Fitzgerald said in a statement. \"I'd like to thank President (Kevin) Guskiewicz and athletic director (J) Batt for this opportunity. This is a program with a deep and storied tradition, a passionate fan base, and a commitment to excellence that extends far beyond the football field. What excited me most about this opportunity was the vision for what Michigan State can be for years to come. We will restore tradition, and I'm eager to earn the trust of our players, alumni, and fans while competing at the highest level.\"  Fitzgerald, who was a Hall of Fame linebacker and a longtime defensive assistant with the Wildcats, departed Evanston with a 110-101 overall record. His 110 wins and 64 Big Ten conference wins are both program records. As are his 10 bowl appearance and five bowl wins. \nNorthwestern made it to the postseason five straight times from 2008-12 and four straight times from 2015-18. He was named the 2020 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year after guiding Northwestern to a 7-2 record, including an appearance in the Big Ten Championship Game and a win against Auburn in the Citrus Bowl. The Wildcats also finished top 10 in the AP poll for the first time since 1995. Fitzgerald's tenure ended in controversy Though he had his fair share of successes at Northwestern, Fitzgerald's career with the Wildcats ended quickly. Outside of that COVID-shortened 2020 season, he won just seven games from 2019-22. Northwestern also finished with just one win in Big Ten play each year in that span except 2020. \nNorthwestern went 1-11 in 2022 -- Fitzgerald's final season -- with losses to Miami (Ohio) and FCS Southern Illinois. Fitzgerald's 14-31 record from 2019-22 was the worst of any four-year span during his tenure. On July 8, 2023, Fitzgerald was suspended without pay for two weeks after reports emerged alleging graphic incidents of hazing within the program. He was fired three days later after university administrators opted to revisit his status when The Daily Northwestern student newspaper published details of the hazing provided by two former players. Fitzgerald claimed that he was \"not aware of the alleged incidents.\" An investigation conducted by Northwestern also found that the hazing was \"well-known by many in the program,\" though it was not determined whether or not Fitzgerald knew about it. \nIn Aug. 2025, Fitzgerald and Northwestern reached a settlement regarding the former coach's wrongful termination lawsuit against the university. Michigan State acts quickly Michigan State fired Smith and moved to hire Fitzgerald in a span of less than two hours. That's big for the Spartans, as it seems they had a plan in place with the high school early signing period approaching this week. That means Fitzgerald will have at least a couple of days to evaluate Michigan State's roster and its current recruiting class, which ranks No. 32 in the 247Sports Team Composite. That's good for 10th among Big Ten schools. \nHe'll likely prioritize retaining the commitment of wide receiver Samson Gash, a four-star product of Novi, Michigan's Catholic Central High School. Gash is one of two four-star prospects in Michigan State's 2026 recruiting class. Fitzgerald will also have plenty of time to assess things before the winter transfer window opens in January. He may need that time to adjust, given how long he's been out of coaching. \n            ",

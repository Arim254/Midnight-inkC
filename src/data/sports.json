    "body": "\n        Paddy Pimblett isn't supposed to be the good guy. He's young, brash and planned on spoiling a living legend's dreams. Yet through sheer will and a poignant speech, Pimblett shifted the perception around him.Gaethje's heart is the crux of his fighting identity; only the sport's most beloved action stars can rival it. Beloved icons like Chuck Liddell, Dustin Poirier and Max Holloway. Such indomitable will shouldn't be possessed by a loudmouth Scouser, a guy whose mouth writes checks his hands shouldn't check. Pimblett, the betting favorite heading into UFC 324, was supposed to be better than Gaethje. He wasn't supposed to be tougher.Yet that's exactly what we got in Saturday's main event, a bout that takes the early lead for 2026 Fight of the Year after going blow-for-blow in the main event. Pimblett fought Gaethje's brutal style for 25 minutes. Paddy \"The Baddy\" was knocked down twice, taken down thrice and absorbed 200 total strikes. Most people would've crumbled under Gaethe's barrages long before the final buzzer. Not the Liverpool native. Pimblett kept getting up, marching through the fire and giving nearly as good as he got. \"I wanted to be walking away with that belt. I know how tough I am  anyway…\" Pimblett said post-fight. \"There's no other man I'd rather lose to than 'The Highlight' Justin Gaethje, someone I've loved watching growing up watching the UFC.\"\nPimblett hadn't intended to prove his toughness. He knows he's tough. His sole mission was to win the interim UFC lightweight title. Though he fell short in that conquest, there are positives to take away from his performance.Pimblett landed more total significant strikes than Gaethje and was largely more successful in the center of the Octagon. His offensive striking evolution shone through dynamism, angles and combination striking that troubled Gaethje at range. For a fighter long dubbed a commercial star more than a critical one, such success against one of lightweight's most feared strikers is admirable. That being said, there's still work to do.Several of Pimblett's bad habits popped up on Saturday. His chin is still high, his hands low and he too often walks straight back. His offensive wrestling leaves much to be desired, preventing him from using his elite top game. The maturity he's showing between fights -- namely, no longer ballooning in weight outside of fight camp -- and his improved striking offense suggest he can fix these errors.\nWhether he planned to or not, Pimblett shifted the narrative around him through an incredible show of heart, inside and outside of the Octagon. He's a loudmouth. He has said and probably will say things that rub people the wrong way. Pimblett is also sensitive. Fighters are people, chock-full of complexities and contradictions. During his post-fight speech, Pimblett touched on a subject of great importance to him: men's mental health. It's something he's drawn attention to after previous bouts, but those were all fights he won. Pimblett's desire to shed light on the issue, even through defeat, underscores how much it means to him. \"I've mentioned in my post-fight interviews before about men killing  themselves. Two lads that I know have killed themselves since I last  fought,\" Pimblett said. \"So, men, don't bottle your feelings up. Talk to someone...\"\nIt's amazing what you can learn about someone in 25 minutes. Is Pimblett ready to be a UFC champion today? No, but he clearly has the drive to give it his all. Is Pimblett obnoxious? Sometimes, but he also cherishes life. After UFC 324, Pimblett has us wondering if Paddy \"The Baddy\" is really so bad.\n            ",

UFC 324 delivered tons of action and incredible moments on Saturday night in Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena. Justin Gaethje is walking away with the interim lightweight title after an instant classic in the main event with Paddy Pimblett.Gaethje and Pimblett became perfect dance partners on Saturday night after both men appeared to throw caution to the wind and throw down over five rounds. Gaethje dropped Pimblett in the first round and appeared close to finishing things off before Pimblett managed to scramble back to his feet. He was then dropped again and nearly stopped before the round ended.Somehow, Pimblett managed to bounce back and deliver some crushing blows of his own over the next four rounds despite taking incredible damage throughout. In the end, Gaethje took the decision on all three scorecards to earn the interim crown.Elsewhere on the card, Sean O'Malley returned to the winner's circle with a decision over Song Yadong in the co-main event. O'Malley, who was coming off consecutive losses to Merab Dvalishvili in title fights, called for a rematch with current titleholder Petr Yan next. O'Malley holds a split decision win over Yan in non-title action in 2022. Plus, heavyweight Waldo Cortes-Acosta picked up a third knockout win in as many months when he finished Derrick Lewis. \nCBS Sports was with you all week long with the latest news, features and other content around this massive event.

Of his 26 victories, 20 have come via knockout, five have come via decision, and just one has come from submitting his opponent. Of his five defeats, three have come from being knocked out and two have been via submission. Gaethje has never lost a decision in his professional career.Fighting out of Denver, Gaethje is aiming for his second Interim UFC Lightweight Championship after winning it the first time at UFC 249 in a TKO victory over Tony Ferguson. However, he then lost his next bout for the UFC Lightweight Championship, falling to Khabib Nurmagomedov. Gaethje had another shot to claim gold when he challenged Charles Oliveira for the title at UFC 274 but again came up short. He has held the symbolic UFC \"BMF\" title, which he won via a triumph over Dustin Poirier at UFC 291. Check out SportsLine to see Vithlani's picks and analysis.Pimblett, 31, has a BJJ background and made his professional debut as a 17-year-old in his native Liverpool, England. He fought at bantamweight and featherweight for over five years before moving up to lightweight in 2018. Since then, he's won 10 of 11 bouts, including each of the last nine, and Pimblett sports a 7-0 record since joining UFC in 2021. He can triumph in a number of ways as of his 23 victories, 10 have been via submission, seven have come thanks to a knockout, and six have been via winning on the scorecards.While he won championships in other promotions, UFC 324 will be his first title bout since linking up with the promotion. Pimblett, however, has been awarded Performance of the Night in five of his last seven fights, including in back-to-back bouts. He's also a perfect 3-0 in his MMA career in Las Vegas, while Gaethje sports a 3-1 record in Sin City. You can only see UFC 324 picks and analysis at SportsLine. UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett predictionsOne of of Vithlani's UFC 324 picks: He's backing Jean Silva (-205) to defeat Arnold Allen (+175) in a matchup on the main card.\"Silva's 5-0 start to his UFC career came to a screeching halt in his last fight against featherweight title challenger Diego Lopes,\" Vithlani said. \"After finishing his first five UFC opponents, Silva was beat up and knocked out badly by Lopes in a nasty fight. Prior to that, Silva was emerging as the division's fastest-rising prospect. I think he can get back to haunting his fellow featherweights, starting with Allen. Allen is an active southpaw kickboxer and a capable grappler, but he won't have the advantage on the ground like Lopes did. Allen will need to stay on his lateral movement and try to out-volume Silva, but one big right hand or left hook from Silva could change this fight instantly.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 324: Gaethje vs. Pimblett picksVithlani has strong picks for Gaethje vs. Pimblett and other bouts on the UFC 324 card.

    "body": "\n        Sean O'Malley wants his throne back. Song Yadong nearly played spoiler at UFC 324, but O'Malley leaned on championship mettle in the nick of time to get a crucial win in the co-main event from the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\"Oh my God! God, it feels good to win! I hate losing! F---, this feels good,\" O'Malley said.O'Malley's post-fight outburst illustrates a tough road back for the former champion. Consecutive losses to Merab Dvalishvili rendered O'Malley winless since March 2024. Defeating Yadong on Saturday was paramount to proving that O'Malley is still one of the best bantamweights in the world. \"The Suga Show\" started strong. O'Malley flummoxed Yadong with fleet footwork and hyper-quick counterstrikes. He couldn't replicate such success in Round 2. Yadong took the fight to O'Malley, chewing up his leg and ragdolling him with wrestling. The fight was tied heading into the final frame with momentum firmly on the underdog's side. Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nThere are levels to MMA, and O'Malley exercised this just in time. The volume and power behind his strikes increased noticeably. O'Malley bloodied Song's face, landing more significant strikes in Round 3 than he had in the prior two rounds combined. The outcome: three 29-28 scorecards in favor of O'Malley.\n\"Petr Yan has something that I want,\" O'Malley said during his post-fight speech. \"All respect to Merab [Dvalishvili], if he gets the next shot, it's well deserved, but Petr Yan, you want that rematch, and I want that belt. Let's make it happen. Go take care of Merab, if that's what's next. If not, let's run it, baby!\"O'Malley's third-round performance might have saved his case for the next title shot. There are three fighters in the running to challenge bantamweight champ Yan: O'Malley, Dvalishvili and Umar Nurmagomedov. \nNurmagomedov's forgettable win over Deivson Figueiredo could remove him from the immediate running, while Dvalishvili and O'Malley campaign for the next title shot.\n            ",

The news of Cruz's selection for the Hall of Fame was announced during Saturday's UFC 324 event, streaming live on Paramount+.Cruz was a massively influential figure during his time as a fighter, bringing a level of movement to the Octagon that was rare for the time in which he became the king of the 135-pound division.\"Dominick Cruz is one of the greatest bantamweights in combat sports history,\" UFC president & CEO Dana White said in a statement. \"Dominick was an amazing athlete who set the standard for bantamweights, and it will be an honor to induct him into the UFC Hall of Fame this summer.\"Sign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nAfter coming up short in a bid for the WEC featherweight championship against his iconic rival Urijah Faber in 2007, Cruz moved down to bantamweight and won the WEC title with a TKO of Brian Bowles in 2010.Cruz continued to defend that title until it became the UFC championship, making Cruz the inaugural UFC bantamweight champion.Cruz's first reign as champion would not end in the Octagon. He instead was forced to vacate the title due to recurring injuries.\nDespite having been forced to vacate the belt, Cruz returned to action and retained the belt with a split decision win over T.J. Dillashaw in 2016. After losing the title later that same year, Cruz again was sidelined for an extended time due to multiple injuries.Yet again, Cruz battled his way back, going 2-2 from 2020 to 2022 before finally officially retiring from active competition.Cruz has become a staple of fight analysis, drawing on his vast high-level experience to become one of the most respected voices in the game.\n            \n    ",

Silva managed to outlast Namajunas to take a unanimous decision from T-Mobile Arena.The fight was competitive from the start, with Namajunas having success early in the opening round while Silva appeared to still be trying to find her range. Eventually, Silva was able to find a comfortable rhythm, allowing her to open up with her strikes and force Namajunas onto the back foot more frequently.Namajunas managed to turn things around in the second round, primarily due to a single takedown. Both women grappled in a body lock against the Octagon until Namajunas was able to score the trip takedown. While on her back, Silva looked lost on how to work back to standing, instead offering up a single armbar attempt that was easily defended.\nSign up for Paramount+ and WATCH UFC 324 LIVE for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription!

Silva used movement to draw Namajunas forward, where Silva was able to connect with blitzes of punches. Namajunas remained competitive but was losing the majority of exchanges before Silva also scored a hip toss takedown to briefly put Namajunas on her back.\nIn the end, the three official scorecards all read 29-28 in favor of Silva. With the win, Silva picked up her third consecutive win over a former UFC champion and likely cemented a title shot at division champion Valentina Shevchenko.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        One week after appearing in a G League Game, Charles Bediako made a successful return to Alabama's rotation on Saturday night, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes during the No. 17 Crimson Tide's 79-73 loss to Tennessee. Two and a half years after last suiting up for Bama, Bediako looked great in his return, adding a dynamic lob threat to the Crimson Tide's frontcourt.He finished 5 of 6 shooting from the floor -- with four dunks -- and added added three rebounds, two blocks and two steals. It was exactly the type of performance that may make the heartache of doing battle with the NCAA worth it for coach Nate Oats, who thrust his program into the national spotlight in recent days by pushing to get Bediako eligible during the middle of the season.Bediako's return to college basketball after his entry into the 2023 NBA Draft has whipped college basketball into a frenzy. The case is only the latest example of how eligibility standards in college basketball are cratering as the NCAA's rules continue to face legal challenges. An Alabama judge granted a temporary restraining order in Bediako's favor Wednesday, clearing the path for his return to the Crimson Tide.He last played for Alabama in the 2022-23 season as a sophomore before remaining in the NBA Draft pool beyond the NCAA's well-established and clearly communicated draft withdrawal deadline. That deadline has long served as a line in the sand for players weighing their futures.\nPrior to the Bediako fiasco, the precedent maintained by the NCAA was this: if you withdraw before the NBA Draft deadline, you can preserve your collegiate eligibility. If you don't withdraw and choose to remain in the NBA Draft, you are forfeiting your future collegiate eligibility. There was never any ambiguity over that until Bediako found a friendly judge who cleared the path for his return.\n        \n            \n                Norlander's Court Report: Charles Bediako's case could crater college hoops; inside Virginia's rapid rise\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrow in the fact that Bediako signed multiple NBA contracts and has been away from college basketball for nearly three years and you get a messy situation that has stoked the ire of coaches around the country.The precedent now being established by the Bediako case could permanently change the enforceability of the draft withdrawal deadline, further eroding the NCAA's ability to govern college basketball. It's also just the latest domino to fall in a saga that has seen the makeup of college basketball rosters continue to change and skew in a more professional direction.\nWhile some have likened the case to that of Baylor center James Nnaji, who joined the Bears earlier this season after he was drafted No. 31 overall in the 2023 NBA Draft, there are some key differences.A pro career hasn't panned outBediako went undrafted in 2023 and has not played in an NBA game, but he did sign a two-way contract with the Spurs ahead of the 2023-24 season. He's also signed NBA Exhibit 10 deals. Both forms of contracts make him ineligible for college basketball, according to NCAA standards. This is also one key area in which Bediako's case differs from others who have played in the G League before returning to college basketball: Bediako is the first to have been under contract with an NBA organization.Here is an excerpt from the NCAA's statement made by senior vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt:\n\"Mr. Bediako signed three NBA contracts after competing in college for two seasons. The NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any prospective or returning student-athletes who have signed an NBA contract. Eligibility rules ensure high school students get a shot at earning scholarships, and we will continue to consistently apply and defend these rules.\"Charles Bediako was a key player for Alabama for two seasons before declaring for NBA Draft in 2023.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The case for returning to collegeA key point in Bediako's argument for eligibility is that he is within the NCAA's five-year window for eligibility. The clock started when he enrolled at Alabama as a freshman in the 2021-22 season, and the 2025-26 season marks Year 5 on his clock. Since he's within his five-year window and has yet to play in an NBA game, Bediako's representation argues he should be able to play.\"The NCAA's arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement of its eligibility standards is inflicting immediate and irreparable harm upon him,\" said Bediako's lawyer, Darren Heitner, in a statement. \"This harm is particularly egregious given the NCAA's recent decisions granting eligibility to athletes with far more extensive professional experience, revealing a pattern of selective and inequitable application of its own rules.\"Differences between Bediako and Nnaji casesThe case involving Baylor center James Nnaji differs from the Bediako case because, although Nnaji was drafted in 2023 (the same year Bediako went undrafted), Nnaji never signed an NBA contract. Nnaji was also cleared by the NCAA to play for Baylor, whereas Bediako has not been cleared by the NCAA. Nnaji also never appeared in a college basketball game and thus was never subject to the NCAA's NBA Draft withdrawal deadline. Bediako was subject to that deadline in 2023.\nA local judge makes decisionThe temporary restraining order granted by judge James Roberts Jr., a Tuscaloosa County Circuit judge, allowed Bediako to play on Saturday. Roberts' decision drew criticism after it was revealed he is listed as a donor to the University of Alabama's athletic department.  But it won't be the final judicial say on the matter. The initial ruling covers just 10 days, which means Bediako will likely need a preliminary injunction on Jan. 27 if he wishes to continue playing.What Oats said about his roster additionAlabama needs help on the interior, and Bediako profiles as a strong rim protector after leading the Crimson Tide in blocks with 1.8 per game in the 2022-23 season. Though Bediako is averaging just 4.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 0.6 blocks in 15.1 minutes per game for the Motor City Cruise, he size, length and track record of collegiate production could benefit the Crimson Tide. Those attributes were all on display against Tennessee.\n\"He was here not that long ago, and when he was here, he was an elite rim protector, very good post defender, rebounder, very good lob target,\" Alabama coach Nate Oats said. \"And I think his game's continued to develop, and we'll try to use some of the stuff he's developed. But right now, we're just trying to get him used to playing with the players we have.\"What other coaches are saying about BediakoFlorida coach Todd Golden said \"I don't agree with it, and I don't think he should be playing.\" He also added that he doesn't fault Oats for taking a step that could help his team win games.\"We are going to beat them anyway,\" Golden said. \"If he plays, we'll beat them anyways.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Florida's Todd Golden sounds off on Charles Bediako's potential return to Alabama: 'We'll beat them anyway'\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKentucky coach Mark Pope suggested the NCAA Tournament selection committee should not consider results that occurred when a team played someone who is not eligible under NCAA rules.\"The one stop gap that is kind of spreading right now, that maybe has some legs, is that the NCAA does get to decide who gets to go to the NCAA Tournament,\" Pope said. \"They get to decide that. They have that power. \"They've been very, very clear about the rules they're going to try to enforce,\" Pope added. \"They might lose in court, but they still get to decide what games count towards the NCAA Tournament.\"\n            ",

Gaethje, a former interim champion and two-time title challenger, is arguably the most exciting athlete UFC has ever seen. Pimblett backs up his big talk and hopes to parlay a victory at UFC 324 into an explosive grudge match with Topuria. Follow live updates on UFC 324: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett as event debuts on Paramount+\"I'm happy I'm the underdog and I'm happy to be fighting someone so confident with so much momentum behind them because one thing you must understand in this game is, I don't care how confident you are, you better be perfect,\" Gaethje told CBS Sports this week. \"And he's going to make mistakes and I'm going to take advantage of his mistakes.

    "body": "\n        TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – If this was the end of college basketball as we knew it, it finished with a rousing ovation. As Charles Bediako, a 23-year old who was playing for the G League's Motor City Cruise all of a week ago, checked in with 16:11 in the first half, he was welcomed back to a standing ovation from many of the 13,474 Alabama fans in attendance inside Coleman Coliseum. Bediako will no doubt receive far less welcoming reactions if he's eligible to continue playing past Saturday night's 79-73 loss vs. Tennessee, but Alabama fans seemed to relish that the Crimson Tide defied the NCAA's wishes and played him. Bediako quickly scored four points after coming onto the floor including a dunk that again brought an electric Tide crowd to its feet. If you wondered why Alabama was willing to go through all this trouble, to evoke such strong and often negative reactions from its peers, this was it. In the first half, Bediako gave Alabama the kind of elite rim-runner it has been missing, scoring eight points on 4-4 shooting. He finished with 13 points, two blocks and three rebounds in 25 minutes of action. \"I thought he was good,\" said Alabama coach Nate Oats. \"He almost led us in blue-collar points. He's got to get a few more rebounds for us, he knows it and he was telling me that in the first half when he came out. The guys all loved him and he's a great teammate. He's going to help us moving forward, we just got to get him rebounding the ball a little bit especially on the defensive end.\" \nThat is an important part to remember: Alabama is going through all this trouble not because it is some revolutionary and trying to stick it to the NCAA. It is doing so because it badly needed a backup big man, and Bediako was the best possible mid-season addition available. Even with Bediako's contribution, a short-handed Alabama team without its second and third-leading scorers lost its second consecutive home game for the first time in six seasons. Bediako has another hearing Tuesday to determine if this was a one-and-done foray back into college basketball or if he can stick with this Alabama team through the remainder of the season. When asked about it Saturday night, Bediako sidestepped the question but his answer indicated he doesn't want it to end after only one game.\"My main focus is around this next game and just getting better with the team,\" Bediako said. \nIf he's successful Tuesday in getting an injunction, this could be just the beginning of what's to come in college basketball. The line between professional and college athlete has already faded to an almost infinitesimal difference. Just this year alone we've seen what we believed to be clear and impenetrable rules fall by the wayside. Parallels with Baylor's Nnaji First, it was Baylor bringing in James Nnaji, who was drafted 31st overall in the 2023 NBA Draft but never played in the NBA nor collegiately. Notably, the NCAA approved Nnaji's waiver – it did not do so for Bediako – but it still felt like a crossroads moment. Nnanji's return prompted Bediako to consider a return to college basketball after playing for Alabama from 2021-23. Bediako went undrafted in 2023 and hasn't played in the NBA but signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. That should have prevented a collegiate return – once you forego eligibility and sign an NBA deal there's no going back, or so we believed – but he successfully obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) to play in Saturday's important home game against Tennessee. \nWho knows what happens next. Some school somewhere could become even more aggressive in trying to add a former NBA player onto its roster. What about trying to convince an NBA 15th man who isn't playing to come back for another year of college basketball and an accompanying big NIL payday? This is the world we live in. The NCAA is feckless and hapless at enforcing its rules. Despite strongly worded statements from NCAA president Charlie Baker and vice president of basketball Dan Gavitt, Alabama forged ahead undeterred. As long as you can get in front of a friendly local judge, anything is possible these days. If Saturday night is any proof, the fanbase will love you for it. \"What they're doing now is exploiting the NCAA and they're forum shopping in some aspects, saying, 'Well, if that's the case, we're going to jump down from federal court to state court where we could get a more favorable result,\" said Mitch Gilfillan, a former college basketball coach and now an attorney at Quinn Johnston. \"Until Congress acts, which it does not appear that they're going to, I think you're going to continue to see more and more challenges.\"\nScott Schneider, a Title IX and employment attorney, calls it \"a real structural problem for how the NCAA is organized.\" Due to the NCAA's unincorporated association structure, it is technically a citizen in each state it has a member institution. That makes it vulnerable to state courts that may be more friendly to the local university than the national NCAA organization. Alabama coach Nate Oats had no problem with Charles Bediako returning to the Crimson Tide. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Schools look for home-court advantageIt played out in Tuscaloosa where Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts has donated at least $100,000 to the Crimson Tide Foundation, according to its website. His wife, defense attorney Mary Turner Roberts, continues to represent former Alabama basketball player Darius Miles who has been charged with capital murder in the January 2023 shooting of Jamea Harris. It's not exclusively an Alabama situation, either. It could help Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss gain a sixth year of eligibility after being denied by the NCAA and later filing a lawsuit in Lafayette County in Mississippi. It could help Duke in its recently filed lawsuit against quarterback Darian Mensah, as a local judge already granted a TRO to prevent Mensah from enrolling at another school. \n\"If they were a corporation or organized in a different way, this lawsuit that was filed against them in Alabama, what they could do at that point is remove it to federal court,\" Schneider told CBS Sports. \"But because they are a citizen in Alabama, they can't do that. You see this in the Chambliss lawsuit, you see this with (Bediako) in Alabama and you see it over and over again. If I can file a case in a favorable forum, I'm probably going to get a good result.\" Alabama will learn more Tuesday but comments like Oats' \"he's going to help us moving forward\" certainly indicate how the school thinks it'll turn out. It's not a bad election strategy for local judges to side with the popular university, either. After the game ended, fans waited to cheer on Bediako as he left for the locker room. A trio of elementary-school aged fans had handmade signs they wanted Alabama's newest basketball player to sign. In a surreal moment emblematic of where college sports is these days, Bediako gladly autographed one that read, \"Bama Pay$ Better.\"\n\"Everybody came to support,\" Bediako said. \"It felt great to be back, especially with an Alabama across my chest.\" To put it mildly, many around the sport don't believe it's quite so great that Bediako is back and playing. Critics believe actions like Alabama suiting up Bediako have left college basketball's foundation as shaky as ever. \"We just need some people to stand up and start taking a stand,\" Florida coach Todd Golden said earlier this week. In Tuscaloosa, fans gladly stood up and cheered its erosion. \n            ",

CampbellBrookhouseMahjouriMormileWiseGaethje vs. PimblettPimblettPimblettPimblettGaethjeGaethjeO'Malley vs. YadongO'MalleyO'MalleyO'MalleyO'MalleyYadongCortes-Acosta vs. LewisLewisCortes-AcostaCortes-AcostaLewisLewisSilva vs. NamajunasSilvaSilvaSilvaNamajunasNamajunasAllen vs. SilvaAllenSilvaSilvaSilvaSilvaJustin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett predictionsCampbell: Now that Pimblett has evolved into a more focused and precise version of himself at age 31 (along with getting himself into world-class physical shape), his speed and length advantages figure to be an issue for the battle-tested Gaethje. It should go without saying that Pimblett will need to show a sturdy chin early and live up to his slogan that \"Scousers don't get knocked out.\" But for as dangerous as Gaethje is, Pimblett holds a distinct advantage on the ground with his submission game opposite a strong amateur wrestling background for Gaethje that surprisingly never gets utilized in his UFC bouts. Pimblett will take his time and eventually expose the aging chin of his 37-year-old opponent in a breakthrough win. Pimblett via TKO4\nBrookhouse: Gaethje hasn't been very active in recent years and is now 37. Add in that he's taken a more patient and tactical approach to fighting in the later stages of his career and I think you have the recipe for Pimblett to win this fight. Pimblett has the length to punish Gaethje on the outside and can tangle Gaethje up and use trips to take the fight to the ground. If the fight hits the floor, that's far more Pimblett's world, whether he is attacking with submissions or dominating position to deliver strikes. This feels like a great fight for Pimblett to get the biggest win of his career. Pimblett via SUB2Mahjouri: I promised to stop picking against Pimblett after he thrashed Michael Chandler. He doesn't make it easy. Statistically, it's hard to see Pimblett's path to victory.  Pimblett is a dual-finishing threat, but falls short in key categories. Gaethje is the more powerful and experienced striker with surprisingly higher striking defense. Pimblett has the biggest advantage on the ground, but historically lacks the offensive wrestling required to take the fight there. What these overall statistics don't conclude are their recent trajectories. Pimblett, 31, makes meaningful improvements from fight to fight. Chandler and King Green are indeed over the hill, but Pimblett beat them with such ease that you can't dismiss his growth. Gaethje, 37, is nearing the end by his own admission. Pimblett will properly prepare for this dangerous task. He'll know to keep his chin down -- a recurring bad habit of his -- against a juggernaut like Gaethje. Pimblett via SUB4Mormile: Gaethje via TKOWise: Gaethje via UDSean O'Malley vs. Song Yadong predictionsCampbell: O'Malley badly needs a win following back-to-back title losses to former champion Merab Dvalishvili. But the fact that Petr Yan, who defeated Dvashvili in their December rematch to once again become bantamweight king, holds a 2022 loss to O'Malley by split decision means that a rematch could be next if \"Suga\" can keep pace atop the division rankings. For as strong and solid as Yadong has become at age 28 following eight years as a UFC fighter, his style is still too basic for O'Malley not to expose over 15 minutes with his dynamic striking attack. While Yadong is durable enough to prevent O'Malley from delivering a highlight-reel statement and should prove able to keep the fight competitive, expect a return to form from the former champion. O'Malley via UD\nBrookhouse: We've seen O'Malley struggle against men who bring heavy pressure and can make him uncomfortable with grappling. Yadong isn't that fighter, though. Yadong is a good striker, but he is going to struggle to stay in his striking range, while O'Malley can work from the outside and utilize his length. Yadong doesn't really have the game to force O'Malley out of his comfort zone or rhythm and that should let O'Malley cruise to a decision win. O'Malley via UDMahjouri: O'Malley still has life in him as an elite bantamweight. He admits taking consecutive fights against Dvalishvili was a mistake, and took ample time off to address nagging injuries. He's a precise, powerful striker with a solid grappling game. Song is one of the more well-rounded fighters in the division, but his experience with elite bantamweights suggests his ceiling is below the title level. Song's win over Henry Cejudo was too competitive, considering the future Hall of Famer retired one fight later. His losses to Cory Sandhagen and Yan further drive home the point. Song can certainly play spoiler, but I fear we forget how thoroughly O'Malley dissected Marlon Vera in their rematch. O'Malley via UDMormile: O'Malley via UDWise: Yadong via TKO2Cortes-Acosta vs. Lewis predictionsCampbell: With four wins in five appearances alone over the past 10 months, Cortes-Acosta has rapidly become a legitimate threat to the heavyweight title picture. But the grind of constantly being in training camp can become a grind that sneaks up on fighters over time. And Lewis, who claims he is entering this fight in arguably the best shape of his career, is the wrong fighter to potentially make a mistake against or have an off night. Even at 40, the UFC's record holder for career knockouts is still as dangerous as ever. Lewis has won three of his last four fights, all by stoppage, and still owns the ability to weather damage before delivering the dramatic finish. The fact that Lewis feels so healthy after years of nagging injuries and fluctuating weight should be taken seriously here. Lewis via KO2\nBrookhouse: Lewis has an unbelievable ability to find ways to land fight-ending bombs against almost anyone, so he can never be counted out in any fight. That said, Cortes-Acosta is the more well-rounded fighter and has shown the ability to shift from striking to a measured, slower-paced approach to neutralizing dangerous big men. Cortes-Acosta may be willing to risk some exchanges early, but he'll likely shift to takedowns to try and keep Lewis grounded and away from throwing his looping power shots. It may not be pretty, but this is a fight Cortes-Acosta can grind away with repeated takedowns. Cortes-Acosta via decisionMahjouri: The jury is out on Cortes-Acosta. Is he a legitimate elite heavyweight or the type of hype train that Lewis feeds on? I believe it's the former. Cortes-Acosta has won seven of his last eight fights and took a round off interim title challenger Serghei Pavlovich in his lone loss during that stretch. It's Cortes-Acosta's striking defense that inspires confidence. Don't let his recent string of knockouts fool you; he knows how to stay safe and win fights over 15 minutes. Cortes-Acosta should employ a responsible style, mixing distance and footwork with carefully timed takedown attempts. If he can avoid Lewis' blitzes, an admittedly hard ask against the UFC KO record holder, he should win the fight on the scorecards or with a late knockout.

    "body": "\n        Saturday at the 2026 American Express saw the breeze pick up for the first time all week, which slowed some of the scoring barrage from the first 36 holes in La Quinta, California. That was apparent at the top of the leaderboard, where Scottie Scheffler -- fresh off rounds of 63 and 64 -- faced the stronger test of the Stadium Course at PGA West and shot a 4-under 68 to enter the final round at 20 under.Scheffler made his first bogey of the week on the 3rd, adding another square to the card on the back nine. It looked like he would drop another shot on the 18th after a poor approach from the fairway and a chip that got away from him, but he poured in a 25-footer to hold onto a share of second and keep himself in the penultimate group on Sunday. Scheffler's gritty par at the last keeps him just one shot back of Si Woo Kim, who posted a 66 at La Quinta Country Club to surge ahead of the world No. 1 and into the solo lead at 22 under. Kim strung together three straight birdies on his back nine late in the afternoon, taking advantage of calmer conditions to make a move to the top of the leaderboard. \nJoining Scheffler at 21 under is 18-year-old Blade Brown, who shot a 68 of his own at the Stadium Course to head into the final round where he started the day -- tied with the Texan. Brown, fresh off a 60 on Saturday, managed to stay patient on the tougher course in tougher conditions, and he will now get his first taste of a Sunday in contention at a PGA Tour event. \n\"Just staying level,\" Brown said when asked what he did best on Saturday. \"There's so many emotions that you go through in a round. I was 1 under through 15 holes, and I knew that there were some guys coming up the leaderboard that were going to make a run. I tried to put myself in as many birdie positions as possible and happened to make three coming down the stretch.\"That trio will headline Sunday's final round at the Stadium Course, as the field gets trimmed to the top 60 and ties with the pros no longer stuck in foursomes with amateur partners. Brown and Kim will play together in the final pairing with Scheffler hot on their heels in the penultimate group, looking to apply pressure from a hole ahead all afternoon. Leader1. Si Woo Kim (-22): Kim became a bit of the forgotten man on Friday despite a blistering 63-65 start to his week, as much of the focus shifted to Brown's performance in nearly shooting 59 and Scheffler's presence on top of the leaderboard. However, Kim has been the most steady performer this week, shooting a 66 or better in all three rounds. He's proven over his career that he can take it deep when he feels good. That's certainly been the case this week, and the courses in the rotation at the American Express have played into his aggressive style. His ball-striking combined with a hot putter make him a real threat, and if there's one thing we can count on, it's that he won't start playing conservatively on Sunday to protect the lead. \nContendersT2. Scottie Scheffler, Blades Brown (-21)T4. Eric Cole, Wyndham Clark (-20)T6. Tom Hoge, Matt McCarty, Andrew Putnam (-19)9. J.T. Poston (-18)T10. Patrick Cantlay and four others (-17)Scheffler is still the favorite despite being a shot back of Kim, and it felt like his 68 on Saturday at the Stadium Course came with him playing about as poorly as possible. That should set the bar for what we'll see in the final round, pending winds really picking up. Kim, Brown and everyone else in the chase group should be thinking 25 under is about the minimum they'll need if they aim to beat Scheffler. Brown's story this week is incredible as he's about to play his eighth straight competitive round of golf after finishing in the top 20 at a Korn Ferry Tour event in the Bahamas earlier this week. It helps to be 18 years old and able to recover quickly, but Brown's mental approach has been particularly impressive. His patience on Saturday paid off with a hot finish, and while he'll have to manage new nerves on Sunday, nothing about his performance to this point suggests he won't embrace the moment. \nBeyond the top three, Clark is the most threatening name of the chase pack. He played his best round of the week on the Stadium Course on Friday and appears to be back in form after a down year in 2025. He kept things on track with a 66 on Saturday and will be looking to notch his first win in more than a year. Notable names to miss the cut Chris Kirk (-9)Will Zalatoris (-9)Tony Finau (-9)Justin Rose (-8)Brian Harman (-7)Sepp Straka (-2)Akshay Bhatia (-1)Ludvig Åberg (WD -- Illness)2026 American Express updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookScottie Scheffler (+100)Si Woo Kim (+200)Blades Brown (+800)Wyndham Clark (+1100)Eric Cole (+1700)Schefter's presence one shot off the lead lengthens the odds significantly of those trying to chase down the leaders on Sunday. The best value on the board at this point has to be Clark, who has the gears needed to post a low enough score to win and seems to be extremely comfortable at the Stadium Course. I liked him as a threat to win on Friday, and nothing about his performance on Saturday changed my mind that he's going to be in the mix all the way til the end. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFC West grudge match everyone has been waiting for has come to fruition in the NFC Championship with the fifth-seeded Los Angeles Rams traveling to face the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks with a trip to Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on the line. The battle between these teams have been neck and neck -- historically so. This matchup between the Rams and Seahawks is the second in NFL playoff history between teams with two regular season games decided by fewer than three points along with the Bills and Browns back in 1949. The Rams outscored the Seahawks by a single point (58-57) and outgained the Seahawks by a single yard (830-829). Los Angeles came out on top 21-19 in Week 11 at SoFi Stadium after pressuring Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold into throwing a career-worst four interceptions. Fast forward to Week 16 at Lumen Field, the Seahawks climbed out of 16-point fourth-quarter hole (30-14) to soar all the way back for a 38-37 overtime victory on a two-point conversion toss from Darnold to tight end Eric Saubert. Los Angeles sent special teams coordinator Chris Blackburn packing just two days after that loss after Rashid Shaheed's 58-yard punt return touchdown ignited Seattle's rally.\n        \n            \n                AFC Championship staff picks: Predictions, odds and more for Broncos vs. Patriots NFL playoff game\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSo which powerhouse squad will prevail to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California? Our CBS Sports staff panel of 12 have picked the winner, and 75% of our panelists are in agreement. All 12 feel Sunday's winner will be decided by a single possession just like each of the first two meetings. \nThe panel (12)Pete Prisco, Senior NFL columnistJohn Breech, NFL staff writerJared Dubin, NFL staff writerGarrett Podell, NFL staff writerTyler Sullivan, NFL staff writer Joel Corry, CBS Sports NFL contributorKyle Stackpole, NFL Draft editorZach Pereles, CBS Sports senior writerJ.P. Acosta, CBS Sports HQ analystMike Renner, CBS Sports HQ analystJordan Dajani, NFL writer Bryan DeArdo, NFL writer\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Rams (8)The Seahawks definitely have one of the best defenses in the NFL, but the last time I saw them on the field against the Rams, Matthew Stafford went off for 457 yards and three touchdowns, and he did that even though he didn't have Davante Adams in the lineup. Adams led the team in touchdown catches, but he didn't play in the Rams' wild Week 16 loss to Seattle. I think Stafford goes off again and leads L.A. to the Super Bowl. Rams 30, Seahawks 23 -- John Breech\nL.A. won the first game between the two teams and probably should have won the second one if not for a very fluky sequence of events. The two teams are close, though; and when in doubt, I go with the better quarterback. Here, that's Matthew Stafford. Rams 23, Seahawks 20 -- Jared DubinSeattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold sees ghosts every time he plays the Los Angeles Rams defense. Whether it's getting sacked an NFL record nine times against them as a Minnesota Viking in the 2024 postseason or throwing a combined six interceptions against them in two regular season games this season with the Seahawks, Darnold can't quite figure out Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula's unit. Rams 27, Seahawks 24 -- Garrett PodellThe Rams had the most consistent offense in the NFL this season. I just trust Matthew Stafford much more in a big game like this than Sam Darnold when the chips are down. Rams 31, Seahawks 24 -- Mike Renner\nI predicted a Rams-Bills Super Bowl before the playoffs started. While my AFC team didn't deliver for me, I'm going to stick with my NFC pick, especially with the news that Seattle is without one of their best players in running back Zach Charbonnet. Rams 27, Seahawks 20 -- Bryan DeArdo The Rams were my preseason NFC pick, so I'm not changing that now. Even though this Seahawks defense looks incredible. Keep in mind that the Rams dropped 581 yards of total offense and 37 points on the Seahawks in December despite the loss. I trust Matthew Stafford much more than Sam Darnold. Rams 30, Seahawks 27 -- Jordan DajaniThese two teams are very evenly matched, but I think the biggest difference in this game is Rams RG Kevin Dotson being healthy. If the Rams are able to grind out some successful runs against this Seahawks defense I think they can move the ball more effectively than Seattle. Rams 28, Seahawks 24 -- J.P. Acosta \nThe Seahawks have several advantages in this game, including a dominant defense, the fact that they're at home and the fact that they had a first-round bye and then cruised past the 49ers. But the Rams have Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua -- a duo that shredded Seattle in Week 16 -- and picked off Sam Darnold six times in two regular-season meetings. Give me the better quarterback in a thriller. Rams 28, Seahawks 27 -- Zach Pereles\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seattle Seahawks (4)The Seattle defense is the best unit left in the playoffs. I know the Rams had success the last time they played them against that defense, but this will be different.  Seahawks 23, Rams 17 -- Pete PriscoSeattle's defense is one of the few remaining superpowers that a team has in these playoffs. They have utterly dominated opponents this season, and they'll be near-impossible to slay at home. I thought Sean McVay looked a bit shaky in that win against the Bears, and Stafford's offense was kept in check by a lackluster Chicago defense. If that continues, it could be another convincing effort by Seattle en route to Super Bowl LX.  Seahawks 30, Rams 20 -- Tyler Sullivan\nThe better defense prevails since Sam Darnold exorcised his Rams demons during the 4th quarter and overtime in Week 16. Seahawks 23, Rams 20 -- Joel CorryLos Angeles hasn't been the same team since blowing a 16-point fourth-quarter lead to Seattle in Week 16. The defense has regressed to its talent level, and the offense, while still potent, has looked disjointed at times. Expect Seattle to exploit those weaknesses en route to its first Super Bowl appearance since the 2014 season.  Seahawks 20, Rams 17 -- Kyle Stackpole\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State is expected to hire Arthur Smith as its next offensive coordinator, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. The former head coach of the Atlanta Falcons, Smith spent the last two seasons as the offensive coordinator of the Pittsburgh Steelers.At Ohio State, Smith will take over an offense that has run like a well-oiled machine under coach Ryan Day as he replaces Brian Hartline, who took the head coaching job at South Florida. Smith is the second former NFL head coach hired by Day in a three-year span. Chip Kelly ran the Buckeyes' offense in 2024, helping the team win a national championship before returning to the NFL. This past season, the Buckeyes were the No. 1 team in the country before falling to eventual national champion Indiana in the Big Ten Championship. After having a first-round bye, Ohio State then fell in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals to Miami, the national runner-up. In Columbus, Smith inherits a star-studded group on offense headlined by quarterback Julian Sayin and receiver Jeremiah Smith. But Smith hasn't coached in the college ranks since 2010 when he was a defensive intern at Ole Miss. Prior to that, he was a graduate assistant at North Carolina, his alma mater, in 2006 after he played for the Tar Heels as an offensive lineman from 2001-05. \n\n        \n            \n                Way-too-early top 25 college football rankings for 2026 season: Ohio State, Texas, Georgia lead the way\n                \n                    Brandon Marcello                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSmith, however, does have extensive NFL experience having worked for four different franchises. He spent the bulk of his coaching career with the Tennessee Titans, where he worked his way up from a defensive quality control coach to offensive coordinator under Mike Vrabel, an Ohio State alum. Smith then parlayed that success into a coaching job with the Falcons.In his three seasons with Atlanta, Smith went 21-30 -- three straight 7-10 finishes -- without a playoff appearance. After his firing, Smith landed with the Steelers as their offensive coordinator in 2024.In Smith's first season leading the offense -- and with a combination of Justin Fields and Russell Wilson at quarterback -- Pittsburgh ranked 16th in the NFL at 22.4 points per game. This past season, with Aaron Rodgers under center, that number rose to 23.4 points per game. That ranked 15th in the league.\nThe Steelers won the AFC North but fell in blowout fashion to the Houston Texans in the wild card round. Soon after, longtime coach Mike Tomlin stepped down. Earlier Saturday, the Steelers agreed to hire Mike McCarthy as their next coach. \n            ",

The hero? Mark Mitchell, whose game-winning 3-pointer over two defenders sent Mizzou Arena into pandemonium.But the drama started at the end of regulation. With Oklahoma ahead 81-78 and just five seconds remaining, Missouri junior Trent Pierce -- a Tulsa native -- hit his only field goal of the night: a 37-foot pull-up 3-pointer off an assist from T.O. Barrett, forcing overtime and keeping the Tigers' hopes alive.Overtime was just as tense. Oklahoma guard Xzayvier Brown hit a floater with four seconds left to give the Sooners an 87-85 lead, seemingly putting Missouri out of options. But with no timeouts, Barrett quickly threw the inbound pass to Mitchell, who dribbled five times to the 3-point line and calmly drained the buzzer-beater to stun the Sooners.\nMitchell finished with a team-high 25 points and added 10 rebounds for his fifth career double-double. He also hit a milestone in the second half, surpassing 1,500 career points. Barrett added to the effort with a career-high 21 points in his first start to go with six rebounds and three steals, while Jayden Stone chipped in 20 points and seven boards. Oklahoma got big performances from Nijel Pack (25 points, five assists) and Brown (19 points, six assists), but the Sooners dropped their sixth straight SEC game and remain at the bottom of the standings ahead of Tuesday's matchup against No. 20 Arkansas.\nFor Missouri, the thrilling win gives it momentum after losing three of its previous four games. The Tigers travel to No. 17 Alabama on Tuesday.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Salute to Veterans Bowl unfolds on Tuesday when the Troy Trojans take on the Jacksonville State Gamecocks. Troy won its division in the Sun Belt but fell in the conference championship game in its last contest, 31-14, to James Madison. Jacksonville State also lost its title game in Conference USA, falling to Kennesaw State, 19-15, when it last took the field. Troy cornerback Kaleno Levine has declared for the NFL Draft and will not play in this matchup.Kickoff is at 9 p.m. ET from the Cramton Bowl in Montgomery, Ala. After opening as underdogs, the Gamecocks are now 2.5-point favorites in the latest Troy vs. Jacksonville State odds, while the over/under is 49.5.

Jacksonville State is on a 6-3 run with the Over as it easily racks up points with the nation's leading rusher in Cam Cook. He's projected to find the end zone, while JSU quarterback, Caden Creel, is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns of his own.As for Troy, its style of play is conducive to quick scoring as it ranks in the bottom seven in FBS in both rushing offense and yards per rush. Thus, it leans on the passing game, and it is facing a defense which does not travel. Five of the six highest point totals that Jacksonville State has allowed have come away from its home stadium. SportsLine's model is projecting 53 combined points as the Over hits in well over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits more than 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Troy vs. Jacksonville State, and which side of the spread hits more than 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Jacksonville State vs. Troy spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's up on its top-ranked money-line and total picks, and find out.\n            ",

For parlays and round robins, tabs appear in the betting slip, making this process easy. For SGPs, it's a bit trickier compared to most other sportsbooks. A user must click on the game of choice, followed by the Same Game Parlay option, select multiple plays, and click Add to Betslip before placing the wager. Multiple SGPs are able to be combined into parlays. Get started now:Crab Sports promo and bonuses for existing usersLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports features promotions for existing users that can enhance the value of their bets. With both profit boosts and no sweat options, there is plenty for Maryland users to enjoy after the initial welcome bonus.Best Crab Sports promos this weekEvery day SGP 50% bet insurance – users can place a $50 or greater bet on a three-or-more-leg SGP (+500 odds or longer). If that first eligible bet each day loses, the player will receive a 50% free bet up to $50. This promotion is unique to Crab Sports on a daily basis and most sportsbooks will offer a similar promotion occasionally at best.Crab Parlay Boost – With qualifying bets, a percentage boost will be added for each leg of the parlay up to 50% for the 15th leg.Social giveaway – Players who win the Crab Sports social media giveaway will receive a $25 Lottery Ticket Free Bet that must be used within four days of issuance.Refer a friend – New referrals and those who refer a friend will each receive a $10 Lottery Ticket Free Bet upon using a unique code given by the existing member.Deposit matchesOccasionally, sportsbooks offer deposit matches in which the user must deposit a required amount or more before receiving additional funds via cash or bonus bets. Most sportsbooks will require the deposit + bonus amount to be wagered before requesting a withdrawal. For Crab Sports, after the first bet, all cash winnings may be withdrawn as any no sweat bets aren't considered cash.No Sweat Bet tokensUsers can apply a token where if the selected bet loses, the player will get a refund in the form of a free bet, which is not redeemable for cash.Boosted OddsGenerally two leg Same Game Parlays where the sportsbook will enhance the odds to make it more enticing to bettors.Profit boosts / SGP profit boostsLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports offers profit boosts for parlays and occasionally straight wagers. Some profit boosts incentivize adding more legs to the parlay for a greater boost.Crab Sports user experienceThe user experience at Crab Sports is friendly as the sportsbook relies on a simplistic design where the odds pop due to a different color scheme than the rest of the text. The menus are easy to follow and choosing a sport or game is no more difficult than at any other sportsbook. User InterfaceThe design of the site is appealing with several variations of blue mixed with a grey color scheme, with black, white, and blue text. I like that the odds pop on the site, with a larger font and navy-blue text against a grey background. While the design looks a bit antiquated compared to the national competition, I can't say that it's a deterrent by any means from playing on the site.Crab Sports Home Screen LayoutOn desktop, the home screen features rotating banners with promotions and top games for that night. Live betting is prominently featured in the center with the games from around the world currently in play. On the left side, Links, Popular, and All Sports give the user plenty of menu options, as does a bar with each sport's icon towards the top. The My Selections tab on the right is visible throughout so you can see which picks you have selected. Overall, Crab Sports provides a clean look and is easily navigable on computers.On mobile, the home screen shows the sport icons at the very top, followed by rotating banners, and the live games. The menus at the bottom include Home, A-Z Sports, an icon to view your selections, Live, and My Bets. Once again, a very clean design for users and easy to navigate for both new and experienced players.Sportsbook app design, speed, functionalitySimilar to the desktop site, the odds pop on the app with larger navy-blue text against a lighter background. The functionality works similarly to the desktop site and lag doesn't seem to be an issue in my testing. But it's hard to compare Crab Sports' app to the feature-rich national brands such as DraftKings and FanDuel.For players who know what they want to bet when coming to the site, Crab Sports provides a fine experience. But if you're looking to browse random odds and categories, you have to go game-by-game at Crab Sports vs. menu items showing all games on several other sites.Geolocation issues can be common on any sportsbook app, but in most cases, has not been a major complaint of Crab Sports customers thus far.

When it comes to props, though, the selections are much fewer compared to the larger sportsbooks, which allow more customization as compared to just over/under a set yardage or hits total for example.The Same Game Parlay builder seems like a first-generation version of what we see on the likes of DraftKings, FanDuel, and Fanatics now and can be tedious. You must click on the builder before adding SGP picks, which is a feature of the past on most books. There have been customer reviews stating that live betting cashout offers don't compare favorably to most other sportsbooks, with early cashout offers seemingly lower than other books.Crab Sports key betting featuresCrab Sports offers many of the same betting features found in most apps, including:Early CashoutWhile its offers are not as financially friendly as some of the larger sportsbooks, Crab Sports does offer the ability for users to get out of eligible bets before their conclusion with a profit or loss.Live BettingCrab Sports gives Maryland users the opportunity to bet during just about any sporting event while in progress. Odds changes are easy to note with green and red arrows upon any line movement.SGP generationNot only can users create SGPs, they may parlay multiple SGPs, albeit each one must be created separately.

Crab Sports does not feature a live chat as most other sportsbooks offer.Betting on Maryland sports teamsCrab Sports is a sportsbook exclusively for Maryland sports bettors. All championship odds are for the 2025-26 seasons and from Crab Sports (updated 10/10/25).Baltimore Ravens (NFL) (+1700)With superstars (quarterback) Lamar Jackson and (running back) Derrick Henry, the Ravens were expected to be a Super Bowl contender again in 2025. Baltimore seeks its third Super Bowl title, having won in the 2001 and 2013 seasons. As long as Jackson is healthy and leading Baltimore, the Ravens should remain a threat in the AFC playoffs.Washington Commanders (NFL) (+1900)Led 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year, QB Jayden Daniels, Washington D.C.'s team is capable of making another sustained run in the playoffs. Daniels looks like an elite quarterback as he was projected to be after winning the Heisman Trophy in college.Washington Wizards (NBA) (+49900)As the team with the worst odds to win it all per Crab Sports, this doesn't appear to be a year of promise for the rebuilding Wizards franchise.Baltimore Orioles (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)At 75-87, the Orioles finished last in the American League East Division, which produced three playoff teams. They will look to bounce back in 2026 with a young core including shortstop Gunnar Henderson and second baseman Jackson Holliday.Washington Nationals (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)The 2019 World Series champions are in rebuilding mode for the next few years, as evidenced by a 66-96 campaign in 2025. Outfielder James Wood is the team's brightest star with some additional promising prospects in need of more MLB seasoning.Washington Capitals (NHL) (+2900)The NHL's all-time leading goal scorer, Alex Ovechkin, looks to close out his career in style, adding a second Stanley Cup championship to his resume. Washington most recently won sports' greatest trophy in 2017.Crab Sports responsible gaming toolsAt the bottom of the page on both desktop and mobile, users can click on the Responsible Gambling section.The sections on that page's FAQ include:How to play responsiblyWhat is Problem Gambling?What support is available?What tools can you use to manage your gambling?Voluntary ExclusionUnderage GamblingLinks on the page for gambling help resources include:MD Gambling HelpMD Problem GamblingMD LotteryMaryland State Lottery & Gaming Control AgencyNational Council on Problem GamblingGamblers AnonymousGam-AnonInternational Center for Responsible Gaming988 Suicide & Crising Lifeline Crab Sports banking methodsCrab Sports offers a number of ways for customers to deposit and withdraw money.Deposit methodsThese deposit methods are available for most users.Quick deposit methodsFeesProcess timeMin. depositOnline Banking (via Plaid)$0Instant$10Debit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Credit Card ((VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Withdrawal methodsHere are the primary ways to withdraw money at Crab Sports.Withdrawal optionProcess TimeMax withdrawalOnline Banking (via Plaid)1-2 business daysUnknownDebit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)1-2 business daysUnknownCrab Sports review: Final verdictFor Maryland users, Crab Sports is a fine alternative to the national sportsbooks. The design is simplistic but the interface is easy to use. If you're looking for the bells and whistles of additional menus, a search function, and more individual player betting options, then this isn't the right sportsbook for you. But if you're located in the state and want to take advantage of the generous signup offer, Crab Sports is worth a long look.The app works well and betting pregame or during the live action is easy. Betting SGPs is slower than at other sportsbooks, but at least it is still possible. There are limited options for deposits / withdrawals and the customer support is only via email. This sportsbook does not offer a rewards program as of now. Nonetheless, I recommend giving Crab Sports a shot if you're in Maryland.Honest feedback for how Crab Sports can improveEnhance Same Game Parlay betting: Compared to other sportsbooks, betting SGPs is slow. Clicking on multiple lines / props from the same game should automatically trigger an SGP, whereas now it only works if you press a specific button.Offer more menus for betting selected markets: Similar to BetMGM who also falls short in this category, Crab Sports should create menus so users don't have to click on each game separately to add a certain market.More deposit and withdrawal options: It seems almost standard that options such as PayPal and Venmo, which allow seamless money transfers, should be allowed at every sportsbook. This is a necessary addition in due time for Crab Sports.Crab Sports FAQHow do you get the Crab Sports promo?Use promo code CBSSPORTS on the third page of the registration screen and deposit up to $500 to receive a 100% profit boost on your first wager.How long do Crab Sports withdrawals take?Generally 1-2 business days, if not faster for withdrawals via debit card and online banking.Can you cash out bonus bets on Crab Sports?No, all bonus bets must be played through before attempting to redeem them for cash.How do you contact Crab Sports?Email support@crabsports.com with any questions or inquiries.Do you need a promo code for Crab Sports?Yes, use promo code CBSSPORTS when initially signing up.Does Crab Sports have a good rewards program?To date, there has been no mention of a rewards program for Crab Sports.Where is Crab Sports available?You may only play on Crab Sports if you're physically located in Maryland and are 21 years of age or older.\n            ",

Only Manny Pacquiao and Oscar De La Hoya claimed world titles in more weight classes than Crawford, who was a perfect 20-0 (15 KOs) in title fights. \n        \n            \n                Terence Crawford makes his case as best fighter of his generation with all-time outing against Canelo Alvarez\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHe will go out on top in a way few boxers do, with his final fight being a sensational unanimous decision victory over Canelo Alvarez to claim the undisputed super middleweight crown and ascend to the top of the pound-for-pound ranks. \nCrawford released a video on his YouTube channel announcing his decision and thanking his fans, haters and opponents for their role in pushing him to greatness while noting he's \"at peace\" with his decision to walk away from the sport at 38 years old. \n\"You just never know when. I spent my whole life chasing something. Not belts. Not money. Not headlines. But that feeling, that one you get when the world doubts you, but you keep showing up and you keep proving everyone wrong,\" Crawford said. \"This sport gave me everything. I fought for my family. I fought for my city. I fought for the kid I used to be, the one who had nothing but a dream and a pair of gloves. And I did it all my way. I gave this sport every breath I have. Every scar. Every triumph. Every ounce of my heart. And I've made peace with what's next. \"Now, it's time. Thank you.\"Boxing retirements always come with an asterisk as we've seen countless fighters lured back to the ring, but at this moment, Crawford walks away from the sport on top, with no mountains left to climb. \nAs he notes in his video, the chase was always what drove him in the ring, and having reached the summit he feels it's time to step away and live life outside of boxing. \n            \n    ",

New Ole Miss coach Pete Golding is expected hire Wilson as an assistant coach, sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer.During a meeting on Tuesday, Wilson informed LSU players and staff that he will be joining the Rebels after the Tigers' matchup against Houston in the Texas Bowl on Dec. 27. After Brian Kelly was fired, Wilson was elevated to the role of interim coach and led the team to a 2-2 record with wins over Arkansas and Western Kentucky.While this may be a new gig for Wilson, there is plenty of familiarity with both Golding and Ole Miss. After landing the UTSA job in 2016, one of the first hires made was bringing in Wilson to be his defensive coordinator. Roughly a decade earlier, Wilson served as the running backs at special teams coach for Ole Miss from 2005-07.Wilson, 52, started his coaching career back in 1996 as a graduate assistant at Nicholls State, his alma mater. Wilson then worked his way up the ranks of Louisiana high school football before joining the Ole Miss coaching staff in 2005. He also made stops at Southern Miss, Tennessee and LSU before getting hired by UTSA.\nIn his four years with the Roadrunners, Wilson's record was 19-29 with one bowl appearance. UTSA fired Wilson following the 2019 season, and he spent the next two years as the coach at McNeese State where he went 7-11.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 UEFA Women's Champions League league phase will reach its dramatic conclusion on Wednesday as all 18 teams will compete in nine simultaneous fixtures to settle the final standings. The first-ever league phase of the competition has delivered plenty of dramatic moments and rang in the new era with excitement for future iterations. Only 10 teams secured a spot in the next rounds, but there are still scenarios at play. Matchday 6 promises plenty of high stakes with four direct quarterfinal spots and two knockout phase playoff berths still undecided. Champions League giants OL Lyonnes and FC Barcelona are among the 10 teams who clinched a spot in the next round, alongside current title-holders Arsenal. Now it's about final positioning and any advantages that come with it. Up for grabs remain two spots, with Atletico Madrid and OH Leuven currently in those spots:Here's how to watch the final matchday and what to know:Matchday 6 scheduleWednesday, Dec. 17All times EasternJuventus vs. Real Madrid, 3 p.m. on Paramount+PSG vs. Benfica, 3 p.m. on Paramount+ and CBS Sports NetworkRoma vs. St. Polten, 3 p.m. on Paramount+Bayern vs. Valerenga, 3 p.m. on Paramount+FC Twente vs. Real Madrid, 3 p.m. on Paramount+OH Leuven vs. Arsenal, 3 p.m. on Paramount+Paris FC vs. Barcelona, 3 p.m. on Paramount+Lyonnes vs. Atletico Madrid, 3 p.m. on Paramount+      Wolfsburg vs. Chelsea, 3 p.m. on Paramount+StandingsTop four advance to quarterfinals, and spots 5-12 enter the knockout phase playoffs.\n1.

Wolfsburg, 9 points (+4 GD)8. Arsenal, 9 points (+2 GD)9. Man United, 9 points (-3 GD)10. Paris FC, 8 points (-1 GD)11. Atletico Madrid, 7 points, (+8 GD)12. OH Leuven, 6 points (-2 GD)13. Valerenga, 4 points (-2 GD)14. Twente, 2 points (-6 GD)15. Benfica, 1 point (-7 GD)16. PSG, 1 point (-8 GD)17. Roma, 1 point (-15 GD)18. St. Polten, 1 point (-20 GD)Who will be the top four?The most sought after prize on Wednesday will be a top-four finish. A direct bye to the quarterfinal bypasses the knockout phase playoffs entirely, and if you're a Champions League contender, the most coveted spot at the moment. Not a single one of the quarterfinal spots has been locked down, adding to the high stakes to round out the league phase. FC Barcelona are on top of the league phase table, with OL Lyonnes just behind them in second place. Both are level on total points, with goal differential the divider between them, and each are in the best position to advance as quarterfinalists. \nBeyond the top two teams, it's a multi-club affair for the remaining two quarterfinal slots. Chelsea FC, Juventus, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg, and Arsenal each have opportunities to qualify for the quarterfinal round. Must-win scenariosFurther down the table means a fight for survival. Teams who clinch 11th and 12th place spots will get the honor of advancing into the knockout phase. There are three teams that face potentially must-win scenarios on the final matchday, and perhaps with the right combo of luck and results elsewhere, a few teams could make some Champions League memories. Atletico Madrid are in 11th on the table and have the most comfortable position heading into matchday 6 but face the toughest task if they're to advance into the knockout phase playoff. They'll go up against OL Lyonnes, the winningest Champions League team of all time, and could make a bit of history if they do the impossible. A point could be just enough to seal a place in the next round, but a loss opens the door to others.\nDebutants OH Leuven are in 12th place, and the Belgians are the underdogs of the tournament. They're also up against a big challenge as they take on reigning title winners Arsenal. Valerenga are in 13th place, and the Norwegians are clinging to hope as they go away to Bayern Munich and need other results to go their way.What's next?After the table is finalized with all 12 teams in place, there will be a knockout phase draw to determine the next chapter of the tournament. The draw will take place on Thursday, Dec. 18, as the competition prepares to close out the calendar year. The knockout phase for the 2025-26 season begins in February (11-12, 18-19), and quarterfinals in March (24-25) and April (1-2). Following the semifinals in late April and early May, the final two teams will compete for the ultimate title in Oslo, Norway, on May 23 2026 at Ullevaal Stadion.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One year after leading the Washington Commanders to their first NFC Championship Game in over 30 years, Jayden Daniels' second season in the NFL is ending very differently than his first. Monday, Washington coach Dan Quinn said the team has shut down Daniels for the season due to the dislocated elbow injury Daniels re-aggravated in Week 14.Daniels initially suffered the injury in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks but was cleared to return by Week 14 against the Minnesota Vikings. At the time Quinn had maintained Daniels getting reps was important, even with the team out of the playoff race. However, Daniels landed hard on the elbow, exited and did not return. His last throw of the season, as it turns out, was an interception.\"Super tough, man,\" Daniels said Tuesday of the team's decision to hold him out. \"I don't want to miss games at all. It's been frustrating being associated with missing games. I want to be out there helping my teammates as much as possible, so it's just been a frustrating year at this point, but you learn from it and you move forward.\"\n        \n            \n                Commanders shut down QB Jayden Daniels for remainder of 2025 season\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDaniels played in just seven games this season, and he only finished four. He sprained his knee late in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers but was able to finish the contest. He then strained his hamstring against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 7 and did not return. Then came the elbow injury and re-aggravation in his next two appearances.\n\"Frustrated, disappointed, a lot more emotion, but probably a lot of adversity that I've dealt with on the field for the most part,\" Daniels said about his experience this season. \"And just trying to learn and keep moving forward.\" Daniels did not go on IR, meaning he can (and will) still practice with Washington. He mentioned \"being the best teammate\" for backup quarterback Marcus Mariota, trying to improve and \"see the game from a different lens\" as areas he can focus on over the next few weeks.Daniels started all 20 of Washington's games last year (including playoffs), so his inability to remain healthy this season added a layer to his frustration.\n\"The one game I missed for my hamstring, and my knee, obviously my elbow isn't something that you can really necessarily prepare for,\" Daniels said. \"So, it's most definitely frustrating and at that time, very I would say traumatic, stuff like that. You never know what you do, you see different things. So, I just gotta just move forward and get ready for next year.\"One year after winning Offensive Rookie of the Year, Daniels finishes his second season with 1,262 passing yards, eight touchdowns, and three interceptions through the air. He also ran for 278 yards and two touchdowns.The Commanders were mired in an eight-game losing streak before a 29-21 road win over the New York Giants last Sunday. Next is a home game against the NFC East-leading Philadelphia Eagles on Saturday.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        North Texas quarterback Drew Mestemaker is likely to enter the transfer portal once the window opens in January, sources tell CBS Sports' Chris Hummer. Mestemaker will not make his final decision until after North Texas' Dec. 27 showdown against San Diego State in the New Mexico Bowl. Though it makes sense to think that Mestemaker would follow former coach Eric Morris to Oklahoma State if he enters the transfer portal -- especially after he emerged as one of Morris' latest diamond-in-the-rough success stories at quarterback. But the Mean Green star is expected to garner robust interest from quarterback-needy teams, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz. Mestemaker, who didn't start as a varsity quarterback and instead played defensive back at Vandegrift High School in Austin, Texas, joined North Texas' roster as an unheralded walk-on in 2024. He spent most of his true freshman season as a backup but earned his first career start in the 2024 First Responder Bowl after former North Texas quarterback Chandler Morris transferred to Virginia. Mestemaker wowed in his postseason appearance, as he tallied 448 total yards and three touchdowns in a narrow loss to Texas State. He also solidified himself as North Texas' quarterback of the future. \nIt didn't take long for Mestemaker to prove that his bowl start wasn't a fluke. In North Texas' 2025 season opener against Lamar, Mestemaker threw for 329 yards and three touchdowns while completing 75% of his passes. He also logged a touchdown on the ground. That was the first of three games this season in which Mestemaker had at least three touchdowns passing and one touchdown rushing. Mestemaker guided the Mean Green to an 11-1 regular season record and their first appearance in the American Conference Championship Game, where he accounted for 294 yards and two touchdowns through the air. Mestemaker's 4,129 yards led the FBS -- in fact, he was the only FBS quarterback with at least 4,000 yards passing on the season -- and his 31 touchdowns passing tied with Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin of Ohio State and Baylor's Sawyer Robertson for second-most in the nation. \nThe 6-foot-4 and 211-pound Mestemaker still has three years of eligibility, which adds to his appeal as a potential multi-year starter with more room to develop. \n        \n            \n                College football's transfer portal just hit dizzying speeds: What you need to know about big QB shakeup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMestemaker comes from good stock Mestemaker could be the latest former Eric Morris protege to have success in the transfer portal. A former assistant at Texas Tech, where he tutored Patrick Mahomes, Morris was the head coach at Incarnate Word from 2018-21 and the offensive coordinator at Washington State in 2022. At Incarnate Word, he discovered a lightly recruited quarterback prospect named Cam Ward. Ward signed with UIW in 2020 and won the Jerry Rice Award as the most outstanding freshman in the FCS. He followed Morris to Washington State, where he threw for 3,735 yards and 25 touchdowns. \nWhen Morris left to become the coach at North Texas, Ward transferred to Miami. He finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting and was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft after leading the FBS with 39 touchdowns passing in his lone season with the Hurricanes. Morris also recruited John Mateer, who is gearing up for a College Football Playoff run with Oklahoma, and Emmett Brown, who threw for 16 touchdowns at San Jose State last season, while he was at Washington State. Morris' first starter at North Texas, Chandler Morris, transferred to Virginia ahead of the 2025 season. Chandler Morris guided the Cavaliers to their first 10-win regular season since 1989 with 2,802 yards and 18 touchdowns passing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins were eliminated from playoff contention on Monday night, as they were defeated by Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers, 28-15. The Dolphins entered this prime-time matchup riding a four-game winning streak, but were simply beat down by a better team. The status of starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is again being questioned, as he completed 22 of 28 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns and an interception on Monday night. The box score doesn't tell the entire story. Tagovailoa's two passing touchdowns came in the fourth quarter when Miami was already trailing by double digits, and the Dolphins went a putrid 2 of 8 on third downs.Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel was asked by reporters on Tuesday if he was considering a quarterback change. McDaniel confirmed he was.  \"Well I think the quarterback play last night was not good enough, and so for me, everything is on the table,\" McDaniel said.Who would McDaniel start if he were to bench Tagovailoa?\n\"Well I think that we are in the process of game-planning for the Cincinnati Bengals, so in that process, we are trying to determine who will give us the best chance to win and I'll probably give you more clarity on that tomorrow, as we are 14 hours removed from the game,\" McDaniel responded. The Dolphins have two other quarterbacks on roster: Former No. 2 overall pick Zach Wilson and rookie Quinn Ewers. If Tagovailoa were to be benched, it may be Wilson who is handed the keys to the offense, as Ewers was the designated QB3 on Monday night.In 14 games this season, Tagovailoa has completed 67.7% of his passes for 2,660 yards, 20 touchdowns and a league-leading 15 interceptions, which also marks a career high. The former Pro Bowler has appeared to have regressed this season. In 2022, Tagovailoa led the NFL in yards per attempt and passer rating. The following year, he led the NFL in passing yards with 4,624. That led to him signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension with $167 million in guarantees in July 2024. \nThe Dolphins cannot easily move on from Tagovailoa if they choose to do so this offseason. The former No. 5 overall pick is signed through 2028, and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Still, it's possible this week could mark the end of the Tagovailoa era in Miami. \n            ",

    "body": "\nWhat happens in Vegas may not be staying in Vegas.According to multiple reports, the NBA Cup final may be leaving the City of Exorbitant Resort Fees, Triple-Zero Roulette and 6-to-5 Blackjack beginning next year. The league reportedly is unhappy with the less-than-enthusiastic reception the event has received in three years in Sin City.That means that, much like a space shuttle launch or a New York Jets Super Bowl parade, tonight's NBA Cup final between the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs at T-Mobile Arena is something you may never see again. That raises the question: If the Knicks win, will the City of New York throw a parade through the Canyon of Heroes?The Knicks (18-7) have won five in a row and are coming off a 132-120 win over the Magic in the semifinals. Meanwhile, the young Spurs (18-7) reached the final by upsetting the reigning NBA champions Thunder, 111-109, ending Oklahoma City's 16-game winning streak. The Thunder had lost only one other time this season.New York is a 2.5-point favorite over San Antonio on Tuesday night.While Knicks-Spurs is the marquee attraction on Tuesday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes a full college basketball schedule and the Salute to Veterans Bowl.

Coach Mitch Johnson said he is considering having the 7-foot-4 star come off the bench again on Tuesday, since Wembanyama is still working his way back from injury. Wembanyama missed 12 games because of a left calf strain but returned in Saturday's semifinal win over Oklahoma City to score 22 points and grab nine rebounds in 21 minutes. Meanwhile, Hartstein notes Jalen Brunson has scored 30+ points in four straight games, including a 40-point outburst in the NBA Cup semifinal. \"He has played 39 minutes in each of the last two rounds and that should be his floor Tuesday in the final,\" Hartstein says.

Left tackle Eli Russ (knee) and guard/center Paul Bowling (opt out) both will not play on Tuesday. In addition, starting running back Tae Meadows (159 carries for 695 yards and six touchdowns) plans to enter the transfer portal and has opted out as well. That won't help an offense that already has struggled this season, ranking 90th in scoring (24.3 points per game). On defense, the Trojans are giving up 182.7 rushing yards per game (111th in the country) and will face a Jacksonville State offense that ranks fourth in the nation in rushing (258.0 per game). \"The Gamecocks are better in the trenches and have three wins against quality fellow bowl teams,\" Hochman says. The SportsLine Projection Model agrees. It says Jacksonville State has a 62% chance to cover and gives a \"B\" grade to Gamecocks -1.5.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 11 Louisville at No. 20 TennesseeTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Knoxville, Tenn. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Tennessee -2.5\nLouisville has a trio of guards that's arguably as good as any in the country: Ryan Conwell (19.4 points per game), Mikel Brown Jr. (16.6) and Isaac McKneely (11.4). Led by those three, the Cardinals (9-1) own the second-best offense in college basketball, averaging 127.0 points per 100 possessions. But in their only true road game, they lost at No. 25 Arkansas. On the other side, the Tennessee Volunteers (7-3) own a win over the No. 3 Houston Cougars but have lost three in a row. The Volunteers enter Tuesday's game after a much-needed 10-day break to straighten things out and get some bounce back in their legs.

    "description": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and, with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us, we're working our way deeper",
    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and, with the Winter Meetings drifting farther behind us, we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free-agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. D-backs in on Bregman?There have been whispers about a possible trade of Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte for weeks, even as Arizona aims to compete in the tough NL West. As such, if they do deal Marte, where might they turn? Enter free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman. The Diamondbacks are \"kicking the tires\" on Bregman, reports USA Today.There's some shuffling to be done here, but it could work. If the D-backs find a taker for Marte -- who has five years and $91 million left on his team-friendly deal -- Bregman could take his place as one of the stars of the team. Bregman plays third and Marte plays second, but infield prospect Jordan Lawlar has experience at both second and third base. It might seem like a lot of effort when they already have Marte locked up long term, but there have been rumors of clubhouse issues around Marte since late in the summer.\nThe Imai marketRight-hander Tatsuya Imai profiles as one of the top starting pitchers on the market this offseason and, with a Jan. 2 signing deadline as part of the posting rules, he's expected to pick his MLB employer soon. Imai has already signaled that he's not inclined to sign with the Dodgers, and instead the Wall Street Journal reports that the Yankees, Cubs, and Phillies are the teams that seem to have the strongest designs on Imai's services. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Imai as the No. 12 free agent in the current class. Here's part of RJ Anderson's write-up: Relative to how front offices view hitters transferring from NPB, pitchers are a near-certain quantity. There are too many success stories to fixate on the differences in the ball and the schedule or to suggest it'll have a devastating effect on the talent in question. That's good news for Imai's stock. He's fresh off a dominant season that saw him post a 1.92 ERA and a 3.96 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 163 innings. He possesses mid-90s velocity and a forkball-like slider he delivers from a low release point. Imai isn't far removed from struggling with his command (it took until his seventh professional season for him to walk fewer than four batters per nine innings), but teams confident in his strikethrowing ability could envision him being at least a No. 3 starter as soon as next spring.King could decide soon\nMichael King's two-season stint in San Diego established him as a frontline starting pitcher, at least when health permits, and that's made him a coveted presence on the free-agent market. Speaking of which, Mark Feinsand of MLB.com reports that King may be the next starting pitcher to make his decision and that the Yankees, Red Sox, Cubs, Orioles, and Mets are at present the strongest contenders for his services. King, 30, transitioned from reliever to starter after the Padres acquired him from the Yankees. Over 45 starts and one relief appearance for San Diego, he put up an ERA+ of 134 and an FIP of 3.65. \nMets eyeing more tradesOut are Pete Alonso, Edwin Díaz, and Brandon Nimmo, and in are Jorge Polanco, Devin Williams, and Marcus Semien. The Mets under David Stearns this winter may not be done churning the roster. Specifically, the rotation could be poised for significant turnover, and said turnover might be achieved via trades. Speaking of which, David Peterson and Kodai Senga are available in trade, Jorge Castillo of ESPN reports, on a contract-for-contract basis with the goal of adding frontline talent to the rotation to accompany promising youngster Nolan McLean. However the specifics shake out, upgrading the rotation in Queens is probably the most essential order of business before the offseason is up. Weaver return on Yanks' radar\nOver the last two seasons and change, right-hander Luke Weaver, 32, has emerged as a lockdown presence in the Yankees bullpen. Weaver's now a free agent, and the Athletic reports that there's mutual interest in a reunion. The Yankees have already lost Devin Williams to the Mets this winter, so re-upping with Weaver could be a bullpen priority for GM Brian Cashman. Giants, Houser agree to dealThe Giants and right-handed pitcher Adrian Houser have agreed to a two-year, $22 million deal with a club option for a possible third year, according to ESPN.\nHouser, 32, has mostly been a starter throughout his career, but he has done some relief work too. Last season, he was excellent in 11 starts for the White Sox, going 6-2 with a 2.10 ERA and 3.0 WAR before being traded to the Rays. With the Rays, in 10 starts, he was 2-3 with a 4.79 ERA and 0.3 WAR. The Giants' rotation is fronted by a pair of All-Stars in Logan Webb and Robbie Ray. Past them, there could well be competition for the last three spots, as things are currently shaping up. Landen Roupp probably did enough to earn another shot in the rotation for 2026, but it's possible he isn't a sure thing. Houser will also be in the mix along with Hayden Birdsong, Kai-Wei Teng, Carson Whisenhunt and Trevor McDonald.Reds add relief helpLeft-handed reliever Caleb Ferguson has agreed to a one-year deal with the Reds, per Cincinnati Enquirer. The 29-year-old Ferguson started his career with the Dodgers but has been well-traveled his last two seasons, having pitched for the Yankees, Astros, Pirates and Mariners. Last year he made 70 appearances, pitching to a 3.58 ERA and 1.16 WHIP with 51 strikeouts in 65 ⅓ innings. He made three appearances in the playoffs for the Mariners. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA Cup has now been narrowed down to two teams, with the New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs set to meet in the championship game on Tuesday night in Las Vegas. The Knicks beat the Orlando Magic in the semifinals to reach the title game, while the Spurs ended the Oklahoma City Thunder's 16-game win streak to advance.Victor Wembanyama made an emphatic return after missing almost a month with a calf sprain, putting up 22 points, nine rebounds, two blocks and two assists in the win. He came off the bench for the Spurs, as they're working him back in cautiously coming back from an injury. Though he only played 20 minutes, he was incredibly efficient, shooting 54% from the floor.Wembanyama and the Spurs will now take on a Knicks team that has gone 9-1 in their last 10 games. The two teams will face off in Las Vegas for the championship game, and in addition to having the title of 2025 NBA Cup winner attached to their names, there's also a large sum of prize money on the line.The winning team of the title game will take home $530,933 per player. That's a modest increase from the $500,000 per player during the inaugural event in 2023. While $530K is a drop in the bucket for players like Jalen Brunson, who is making over $34 million this season, or Karl-Anthony Towns whose contract is up to $54 million this season alone, for guys lower on the totem pole, that's a significant sum.For second-year player Ariel Hukporti, who was a second-round draft pick in 2024, he'll get about a third of what his yearly salary is ($1,955,377) if the Knicks win. It's even more lucrative for two-way players. While two-way players only get half of what those on standard contracts do, Kyle Mangas, David Jones-Garcia, Harrison Ingram, Kevin McCullar Jr., Trey Jemison and Tosan Evbuomwan will all earn roughly $265,466 if their team wins. That's almost half of the standard two-way contract of $636,435.\nEven for the losing team there's plenty of money to be made. The team that loses on Tuesday will earn $212,373 per player. That's still a ton of money for the guys on smaller contracts. Even for the bigger players, it's extra money that they otherwise would not have made, and we've heard guys in the past be motivated by the prospect of earning extra dough.After the Magic advanced to the semifinals, which earned each player $106,187, Desmond Bane noted that he was appreciative of the extra cash after just being fined $35,000 by the league for unsportsmanlike conduct.\"That's huge, man. I just lost $35,000. I gotta go get it back somehow,\" Bane said after the win. \"But I'm excited. Great opportunity for us to play some meaningful basketball early in the season.\"\nAside from the monetary motivation, though, we've seen the league's attempt to bring excitement to the early part of the NBA calendar work. The Spurs-Thunder semifinals matchup felt like a playoff game, and we should be in store for another high-intensity matchup between the Knicks and Spurs Tuesday night. Tip off is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. ET on Prime.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.This past summer, a friend of mine presented the scenario in which we could end up in statistical quagmire. I'll go with it in my own words, but thanks go out to my boy Rodney for inspiring this Soapbox.Let's say a pitcher someone allows zero baserunners through nine innings; 27 up, 27 down. We know that as a perfect game. But the score is 0-0 and heads to extra innings. Let's imagine that the team sends this pitcher back out for the 10th inning -- impossible to imagine in this day and age, I know, but just humor me, will you?As we all know well by now, the regular-season extra-innings rules in Major League Baseball say that an automatic runner will start on second base in extras. This means that, despite our pitcher here having allowed nary a baserunner though nine innings, he now has to deal with a runner. The opposing team bunts the runner to third. Then a sacrifice fly plates the run. \nThis pitcher has been the victim of awful support from his team today, for sure, so we'll stick with theme. The bunt wasn't very good, but the defense did a poor job in execution without making an error. The sac fly wasn't deep, but the outfielder made a poor throw home, again, without it being ruled an error. Our pitcher strikes out the next hitter. Then the team of this pitcher goes back out for the bottom of the 10th and fails to score. Our pitcher here faced 30 batters and got all of them out. And he took the loss while having allowed an unearned run. \nThe question is ...Was this a perfect game?Remember, in the 2020 season, MLB ruled that in those seven-inning doubleheaders, any no-hitter thrown wouldn't officially be counted as a no-hitter, which obviously extended to perfect games. This means that MLB is well aware that arguments will occur over stuff like no-hitters or perfect games when weird rules get in the way. Rule 9 in the official MLB rulebook for 2025 covers all the statistics and how they should be figured and ruled. It is extensive, clocking in at 40 pages. It says nothing about ruling on perfect games. Same with the \"definition of terms\" section. Rule 7.01(C) says the following regarding the automatic runner on second base: For purposes of calculating earned runs under Rule 9.16, the runner who begins an inning on second base pursuant to this rule shall be deemed to be a runner who has reached second base because of a fielding error, but no error shall be charged to the opposing team or to any player. For purposes of Rule 9.02, the Official Scorer shall keep records of the number of times each batter and runner is placed at second base in accordance with this rule.If the runner is ruled to have reached on error, it's not a perfect game, except the team isn't actually charged with an error. Basically, there's no rulebook guidance here, which leads me to believe that if this actually happened, the office of the commissioner would be forced to weigh in. One of my pet peeves is the league being reactive instead of proactive and here's another case. \nOf course, none of this matters until it happens, and then it'll really matter. Imagine recording the final out and not knowing if it counted as a perfect game or not.Since there isn't a rule laid out for us, we can run with vibes. It's a perfect game. C'mon. The pitcher faced 30 hitters and got every single one of them out. Of course, I can easily see the rebuttal, right? The team lost. We know what the word \"perfect\" means. Here's a paradox for you, then: How could it be possible for a pitcher to throw a perfect game and also be saddled with a loss? Doesn't the \"loss\" next to his name make the game less-than-perfect? \nWe can go in circles with this one. Discuss among yourselves.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's a new Bradley taking up a Major League Soccer coaching gig as Michael Bradley will lead the next era of the New York Red Bulls after winning the MLS Next Pro title in 2025 with their youth squad, RBNY II. Bradley has been on the fast track, rising through the coaching ranks with this appointment coming only six months after he began his tenure with Next Pro side.The son of legendary American coach Bob Bradley, Michael isn't far removed from his playing career, which ended in 2023 with Toronto FC. He followed that by joining his dad as an assistant with Stabaek in Norway before coming back stateside to join the Red Bulls system. For a team that has been set for years in the Red Bull global playing style, Bradley will offer a breath of fresh air to a system that needs it after seeing a 15-year streak of consecutive appearances in the MLS postseason come to an end, one year removed from losing in the 2024 MLS Cup to the Los Angeles Galaxy.\"I am excited for the opportunity to be head coach of the club that I started my professional career with and also in the state that I call home,\" Bradley said. \"I'm looking forward to working alongside everyone here and doing my part to help this club achieve the success our fans deserve.\"The team that Bradley began his playing career with, the New York MetroStars, may not exist in name, but becoming the head coach of the club long after its change to Red Bulls is a significant step in Bradley's coaching career after a 20-year playing career. It may be early on in his coaching journey, but with him taking charge in MLS, it's also hard not to think about what could be next if Bradley does well with the Red Bulls.\nDue to the global system of the Red Bulls, success here could see Bradley end up at RB Salzburg in Austria to continue to grow as a coach in the European Leagues in a similar path that led to Jesse Marsch eventually moving to the Premier League, but there's also another path that even one successful season in MLS could open for the American.Mauricio Pochettino is out of contract with the United States men's national team following the 2026 World Cup, and if he ends up going back to Europe to coach a club team, there's no reason why Bradley wouldn't enter the conversation. Jim Curtin and Steve Cherundolo are both experienced American coaches who are free agents at the moment, but with each having personal reasons for not taking certain jobs, it's unknown if they would be in a position to take the role if it were to open.If U.S. Soccer wanted to take a look at an American to undergo a long-term role, there would be worse places to look than with someone who has 151 caps for the national team, the third most in history, while also representing the USMNT at two World Cups in 2010 and 2014. \nBefore any of this can be considered, what Bradley does with the Red Bulls in 2026 will be critical, but there's no reason why his coaching star won't continue to rise if he's able to oversee a rebuild with the squad and lead them back to the MLS Cup Playoffs. Coaching is in Bradley's blood, and now, with a new MLS season upcoming, it'll be a chance to see what he can do under pressure with the stakes even higher.\n            ",

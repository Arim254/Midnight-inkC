The civil suit involving an alleged incident at a 2023 NBA Finals game was dismissed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, according to ESPN.The female plaintiff voluntarily filed for dismissal on Tuesday. The voluntary dismissal was filed with prejudice, meaning no further litigation can be brought forward. McGregor had denied all allegations against him and no criminal charges were pursued by the Florida State Attorney's Office in the case.The woman, described in the lawsuit as a 49-year-old business executive, accused McGregor of sexual assault during Game 4 of the series between the Miami Heat and Denver Nuggets in June 2023 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. The alleged assault took place in the men's restroom near the Courtside Club inside the arena, which is the home of the Heat. The plaintiff filed a civil suit against McGregor and the Heat in January.Last November, a High Court jury in Ireland found McGregor civilly liable in a separate sexual assault case. McGregor was ordered to pay approximately $258,300 to Nikita Hand. Earlier this year, Ireland's High Court dismissed McGregor's appeal. \nMcGregor, a former two-division UFC champion, has not competed in mixed martial arts since sustaining a broken leg against Dustin Poirier in July 2021. McGregor is currently campaigning for a comeback fight at the White House card this summer.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- After a full day of trade rumors, there are more immediate concerns about the future of Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo after he collapsed with a non-contact injury minutes into the team's 113-109 win over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. The Bucks announced that Antetokounmpo suffered a right calf strain and he did not return to the game. Bucks coach Doc Rivers did not have an update on Antetokounmpo's status after the game, but did say that he thinks the medical staff has \"ruled out\" an Achilles injury. \"He's doing an MRI right now, so we'll know more hopefully by the end of [Wednesday night],\" Rivers said. \"I didn't know what it was. I just wanted the trainers to tend to him. Right when they brought him in they took him to the hospital.\" Just under three minutes into the first quarter, Antetokounmpo drove along the baseline and found a cutting AJ Green for an easy layup. As he turned to run back up the floor, he suddenly fell and immediately motioned to the bench for help. He remained seated on the floor until Kevin Porter Jr. took a foul to stop play. \nAntetokounmpo was then helped to his feet and was able to walk off the court under his own power. He initially took a seat on the bench, but later made his way to the locker room. Footage from the Bucks' broadcast showed him walking through the tunnel on his own, but moving very slowly. Bobby Portis told reporters that Antetokounmpo was keeping up with the action from the hospital and reached out to his teammates immediately after the final buzzer. \"What's so crazy is Giannis was the first person that texted in the team group message: 'Good job fellas, way to get one.' I haven't talked to him personally, but in the group message, yeah,\" Portis said. \"He was the first one to text congratulating us on the win. Hopefully he's feeling better, feeling well. Haven't seen the video yet either so don't know what it looked like or how bad it was. Praying for him, always in prayers and hopefully everything is OK.\"\nIt's too early to say how long Antetokounmpo may be sidelined, but his initial reaction was concerning. He will need to undergo imaging to fully assess the injury and establish a timeline. Regardless, this is a major blow for a Bucks team that, despite their surprise win Wednesday, is still only 2-5 without their two-time MVP this season and has sunk to 10th place in the Eastern Conference at 10-13. \n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo trade destinations: Ranking all 29 landing spots with Knicks as the clear No. 1\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAntetokounmpo missed nearly two weeks earlier this season with a left groin strain. He does have a previous history of calf issues. In 2024, he strained the soleus muscle in his left calf just before the end of the regular season and missed the team's entire first-round playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, which they lost in six games. Last season, he sat out the All-Star Game and missed nearly three weeks with a left calf strain. Entering Wednesday, Antetokounmpo was averaging 30.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 6.4 assists on 63.9% shooting. He was fourth in the league in scoring, fifth in rebounds and seventh in field goal percentage, and was on pace to average 30/10/5 for the fourth consecutive season (every other player in NBA history combined has eight such seasons). \nAntetokounmpo was well on his way to a 10th consecutive All-Star appearance and eighth consecutive All-NBA First Team honor. A lengthy absence could put both of those streaks in jeopardy. With the league's new 65-game threshold for major awards, Antetokounmpo would be ineligible for honors such as MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA if he misses 12 more games. Prior to Wednesday's game, ESPN reported that Antetokounmpo and his agent are in the process of discussing his future with the Bucks. A resolution was reportedly expected in the coming weeks, but this injury may disrupt any potential trade talks. Bucks coach Doc Rivers refuted the idea that Antetokounmpo has asked out of Milwaukee. \n\"Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever. I can't make that more clear,\" Rivers said before Wednesday's game. \"The thing I keep saying is I go to the source. I talk to the source every single day. Every single day. He loves Milwaukee and he loves the Bucks,\" Rivers continued. \"I've heard guys say they've talked to sources. I talked to the source. If I've learned anything in life, the source usually knows.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wide receiver Adam Thielen's representation approached the Minnesota Vikings about releasing him, as the 35-year-old wideout wanted to play a larger role in an offense in what will be his final NFL season. Thielen, after being waived Monday, will get a chance to do just that after being claimed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday.The Vikings traded for Thielen prior to the start of the regular season, as their wide receiving corps was hit hard by injuries. However, in 11 games played this year, Thielen caught just eight passes for 69 yards. He was made a healthy scratch this past week, as the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0.In Pittsburgh, Thielen joins a wide receiving corps headlined by DK Metcalf, although he is the only pass-catcher to cross 300 yards receiving this season. In Thielen, Aaron Rodgers acquires a veteran playmaker that can move the chains.\n\"I was joking with him, he said this is the best his body has felt because he hasn't been playing a whole lot in Minnesota,\" Rodgers said following Wednesday's practice. \"So I think he's got a lot left in the tank and a lot of impetus to go out there and put some good play on film.\"\n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin on hot seat? Coach offers legitimate reason why Steelers fans are justified calling for his head\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThielen was productive for the Carolina Panthers over the last two seasons, crossing 1,000 yards receiving in 2023, and averaging 61.5 receiving yards per contest in 10 games played in 2024. Thielen, in his 12th NFL season, was picked up by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013 and ended up playing nine years for the team. He ranks fourth in franchise history in receptions (542), fifth in receiving yards (6,751) and third in receiving touchdowns (55).\nThe 6-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North race. The Baltimore Ravens, also at 6-6, own the tiebreaker, while the 4-8 Cincinnati Bengals are lurking in the background with Joe Burrow back in the fold. Pittsburgh has a 44.8% chance to win the division, and 45.1% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chris Paul's second stint with the Los Angeles Clippers ended abruptly on Wednesday when the franchise announced it was parting ways with the future Hall of Famer. Paul, who re-signed with the team this summer on a one-year deal, appeared in 16 games and averaged just 2.9 points.Paul, 40, posted \"just found out I'm being sent home\" on Instagram around 2:40 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The team later confirmed its decision. Speaking for the first time since Paul was released, Clippers coach Ty Lue said the partnership between the team and Paul \"wasn't a good fit.\" \"I just think it wasn't a good fit for what he was looking for,\" Lue said. \"It is what it is. Do I want to see CP go out like this? No. I have a lot of respect for him. He's been a friend of mine over the years. You never wanna see a great go out like this. But I'm pretty sure he will find something because he's a great player. ...

After stints with the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs, Paul returned to where he spent six seasons of his career and departed as one of the most iconic players in franchise history. He hoped to return to the Clippers to finish out his career making a run at an NBA title. \n\"I don't like it,\" Lue said. \"It just didn't work out like we thought it would. I don't like it for CP, but it wasn't a good fit. We understood that. So, like (I) said, it was an organization (decision). They made the choice. We move forward. We got to see what we do. We will see.\"After appearing in all 82 games with the Spurs and logging 28 minutes per game -- the most since the 2022-23 season -- Paul was in and out of the Clippers' rotation. The Clippers are off to a 5-16 start and entered Wednesday's game against the Atlanta Hawks on a five-game losing streak\n        \n            \n                The Clippers did Chris Paul dirty: 'Legendary Clipper' sent packing in the middle of the night\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"This decision had nothing to do with one incident or one meeting that did or did not happen,\" Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank said. \"Some of our business, respectfully have to keep in-house, but this didn't come down to just a one incident and one meeting.\"\nPaul averaged just 2.9 points in 14.3 minutes on 32.1% shooting for the Clippers this season. He cannot be officially moved until Dec. 15 due to salary cap reasons. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last two weeks have been a full-speed sprint for James Franklin at Virginia Tech.The former Penn State coach still hasn't assembled an on-field staff, and with only a skeleton group of support staffers in the building, he's been grinding: recruiting nonstop, hosting visitors, and constructing a class almost entirely from zero. The payoff has been one of the most stunning turnarounds in recent recruiting memory. Franklin has lifted a class that once sat at No. 124 in the 247Sports Composite Team Recruiting Rankings all the way to No. 22 as night fell Wednesday, which was the first day of the three-day early signing period. How did Franklin and the Hokies pull it off? Relationships. And plenty of former Penn State commits.\"It's been a scramble,\" Franklin told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"Some of these coaches that took some of these jobs around the country, and none of the recruits decommitted. One of the coaches I saw landed his plane, and the No. 1 recruit in the country was waiting for him there.\n\"We had a very different experience.\"If you didn't know already, that coach is Lane Kiffin. He ditched playoff-bound Ole Miss for LSU on Sunday and was welcomed at the Tigers' facility by defensive lineman commitment Lamar Brown, who is not quite the nation's No. 1 recruit -- but No. 4 overall is close enough. Meanwhile, the chaos in Blacksburg has worked in Franklin's favor. Cast aside by Penn State on Oct. 12 after three straight losses -- including collapses as three-touchdown favorites against UCLA and Northwestern -- Franklin has capitalized on the market. He said he hosted 17 recruits last weekend alone.The results speak loudly. Franklin has flipped 10 Penn State commitments to Virginia Tech, sinking the Nittany Lions' class to No. 150 in the rankings, one spot below FCS South Dakota State. Twenty-three players have decommitted from Penn State since Franklin's firing, leaving only two signees in the class of 2026.\nEleven of those decommits reunited with Franklin at Virginia Tech, including four-star linebacker Terry Wiggins, who flipped Wednesday. \"People are saying, 'Oh, well, Franklin's flipping all these recruits,'\" Franklin said. \"Well, it's the kids that I know and have relationships with. It has nothing to do with a previous school. It has nothing to do with hurt feelings or any of those types of things. They're the players I know. They're the players that I have longstanding relationships. And although they committed for the academics and the school, it's also about the relationship with the head coach.\"\n        \n            \n                Penn State's botched coaching search turns signing day into unprecedented disaster\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAdding to Penn State's troubles is the lack of movement with its coaching search. Of the 13 openings in the four power conferences this fall, only two remain: Penn State and Cal. Several coaches on Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft's list of candidates have pulled out of consideration over the last six weeks – Indiana's Curt Cignetti, Nebraska's Matt Rhule, Louisville's Jeff Brohm, Georgia Tech's Brent Key, and, most recently, BYU's Kalani Sitake. \nThere was real momentum Monday for Sitake, who is 22-3 the last two seasons, but BYU's donor base rallied. Crumbl founder Jason McGowan publicly offered support, and a day later Sitake signed a long-term extension, just ahead of the Cougars' Big 12 Championship matchup with Texas Tech.On Wednesday, Virginia Tech served Crumbl cookies to media during its signing day event -- a widely interpreted jab at Penn State's latest whiff on the coaching carousel. Franklin denied any such mischievousness.\"Everybody's just trying to create drama and connect the dots,\" Franklin told CBS Sports. \"If you go back and look at the last 11 years at Penn State, we had Crumbl cookies at every single event. I think a lot of people use them. They're in all these college towns.\"\nThe dots fans can connect: this is Virginia Tech's best recruiting class since finishing 21st nationally in 2013. The program had logged only one top-25 class in the previous 12 years.\"(Tight end signee) Pierce Petersohn is asking me, 'Who's the tight ends coach?'\" Franklin said. \"I don't know. 'Who's the offensive coordinator?' You've got to trust me. 'Who's the strength coach?' You've got to trust me. \"That was happening with all of these kids. The only answer I could say is you've got to trust me.\"\nNext for Franklin is building a staff. \"We've got to move quickly because all these other jobs are filling up or are filled,\" he said.The next stretch will be another blaze of activity for Franklin, who admitted Wednesday he was \"shocked\" when Penn State fired him.\"When these decisions get made, people don't realize this affects hundreds of people,\" he said. \"It affects the coaches and their wives and their children. It affects the off-the-field staff and their wives and their children. It affects the current players and their parents. It affects the recruiting class and their parents and people not even talking. We had the No. 1 recruiting class in the country for the 2027 class.\n\"Part of me taking this job is -- not only do I want to coach, obviously -- how do I help as many people who have been affected by this? Because I feel ultimately responsible for all these people.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's been a wacky NFL season -- in a good way. This is actually the first time in NFL history there are five divisions with a lead of less than one game this late in a season! The Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers lead the way at 6-6 in the AFC North with the Cincinnati Bengals lurking, the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks are both 9-3, and the Jacksonville Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts are both 8-4.This week in the NFL, the Dallas Cowboys put their three-game win streak on the line against Dan Campbell's Detroit Lions, Joe Burrow and Josh Allen face off in Buffalo, and rookies Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders meet for the first time in Cleveland. Times are also getting desperate for the 6-6 Kansas City Chiefs, who host the Houston Texans on \"Sunday Night Football.\" Which teams should you pick in Week 14, and which should you fade? CBS Sports writers Jordan Dajani and Jared Dubin are here to break down the biggest games of the weekend. For clarity, lines for these selections were taken from FanDuel Sportsbook on Wednesday. New users can get $150 in bonus bets on a winning $5 wager.Dallas Cowboys at Detroit Lions (-3) (TNF)Dajani (Cowboys +3): Are the Cowboys \"America's Team\" again? I don't know, there's something endearing about seeing a high-powered offense that had no defense to start the year experience a defensive turnaround to get above .500. Shoutout Quinnen Williams, Logan Wilson, DeMarvion Overshown and Shavon Revel Jr. As for the Lions, this defense has not been up to snuff, and the offense could be without Sam LaPorta AND Amon-Ra St. Brown. Detroit ranks first in yards per play with St. Brown on the field since 2021, and 25th without him. Prediction: Cowboys 26, Lions 23\nDubin (Lions -3): I know Dallas is red hot. I know Detroit is dealing with some injuries. But I have the feeling that one of these two teams is a playoff team, and it's the home team, which means they need to win this game. The Cowboys defense has looked better these last few weeks but has also played two broken offenses in Vegas and Philly and then given up four touchdowns to Kansas City. I think the Lions can score to keep up with the Cowboys here, and then pull it out at the end. Prediction: Lions 32, Cowboys 28Cincinnati Bengals at Buffalo Bills (-5.5)Dajani (Bengals +5.5): I knew the Bengals were going to cover the spread vs. Baltimore with Joe Burrow back in the lineup, but I didn't expect them to actually win the game! Cincinnati is 3-0 with Burrow in the lineup this season, and 1-8 without him. If we go back to last season, Burrow has won eight straight starts -- which is tied for the longest win streak of his career. Furthermore, Burrow is 2-0 against Josh Allen, and 14-3 ATS in his career as an underdog of three or more points. Again, I'm not expecting the Bengals to actually win outright, but I'll take 5.5 points. Prediction: Bills 28, Bengals 24Dubin (Bills -5.5): One of the things almost every team can do is run all over the Bengals. We just saw the Bills run all over the Steelers to the tune of 249 yards. James Cook has a chance to really go off here and help the Bills control the game throughout. If the Bengals get Tee Higgins back, then the Bengals' explosive offense could obviously keep pace, but I'm comfortable backing Buffalo's run game here. Prediction: Bills 26, Bengals 20\nIndianapolis Colts (-1.5) at Jacksonville JaguarsDajani (Jaguars +1.5): A massive, massive game in the AFC South. I find it fascinating that the Colts have not won in Jacksonville since 2014 -- going 0-9 during this stretch. The Colts have not looked fantastic as of late, and you have to wonder how much Daniel Jones' fibula injury is affecting him. The Jaguars defense is not the Texans defense, but this is the same unit that destroyed Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers, 35-6, a couple weeks ago. You never know what you're going to get with Trevor Lawrence, but I'll take Jacksonville in a small upset. Prediction: Jaguars 30, Colts 27Dubin (Jaguars +1.5): The shine is coming off the Colts, especially with their quarterback dealing with a fractured leg and barely able to move in recent weeks. (He ran once for one yard in Indy's loss to Houston on Sunday.) Jonathan Taylor is going to be asked to win this game all by himself, and I just am not sure it's fair to expect that of him. The Jags have allowed just 3.9 yards per carry on the season. Prediction: Jaguars 23, Colts 21Tennessee Titans at Cleveland Browns (-3.5)Dajani (Browns -3.5): Just a PSA, next week you're going to have to hear debates about why Shedeur Sanders should have been drafted above Cam Ward, because the Browns are going to win this game. It won't be because of Sanders' play, but because of the Browns' vaunted defense and Myles Garrett's 10 sacks on Ward. It looked like the Titans were making progress in recent weeks, but then Week 13 happened. In a 25-3 loss to the Jaguars, Tennessee went 2 of 12 on third downs and recorded just 188 yards of total offense. Believe it or not, 70 of those yards came on the first drive. For the second year in a row, Tennessee is the worst team in football. Prediction: Browns 17, Titans 6\nDubin (Titans +3.5): The Browns are a different team at home than they are on the road, so I expect them to win this game, largely on the strength of their defense. Myles Garrett might break the all-time sack record this weekend, given the matchup advantages he has here. But Cleveland's offense isn't nearly efficient or explosive enough to bet on the Browns winning by all that many points, so we have to predict a close game here. Prediction: Browns 17, Titans 14Pittsburgh Steelers at Baltimore Ravens (-5.5)Dajani (Steelers +5.5): The Ravens are definitely winning this game (in my opinion), so the issue is the spread. The Ravens have failed to cover in three straight games, and are 1-5 ATS in their past six home games. As for the Steelers, Mike Tomlin is 13-3-2 ATS and 10-8 straight up as an underdog vs. the Ravens, and has lost by four or more points in just seven of 36 matchups vs. Baltimore. Whoa. I'm just going to hope that Aaron Rodgers' little film birthday party he had with teammates helped. Prediction: Ravens 23, Steelers 20Dubin (Ravens -5.5): Pittsburgh's offense just doesn't have enough to hang -- even with a Ravens offense that is struggling in its own right. The Ravens should be able to run the ball on the Steelers. Presumably not as well as the Bills did last week, obviously. But getting Derrick Henry downhill more often should help get the passing game in rhythm as well. Lamar Jackson can't be held down like this for much longer... can he? Prediction: Ravens 23, Steelers 13\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking seven NFL Week 14 games with huge playoff implications: Lions-Cowboys, Chiefs-Texans loom large\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nChicago Bears at Green Bay Packers (-6.5)Dajani (Packers -6.5): No offense to Caleb Williams, but the Bears find themselves at 9-3 because of a defense that forces turnovers and a fantastic rushing attack. However, the Packers have turned the ball over an NFL-low seven times this season, and allow under 100 rushing yards per game. Green Bay is 3-0 vs. the NFC North this season after going 1-5 in the division last year. I understand 6.5 points is a pretty big number in a divisional matchup, but I'll take the Packers to cover the spread Sunday in the fourth quarter. Prediction: Packers 28, Bears 20Dubin (Bears +6.5): I'm fascinated to see the matchup between the Bears' run game and the Packers' run defense. Chicago has forcefully rammed the ball down its opponents' throats since taking its bye back in Week 5, while Green Bay has been able to slow almost any run game in its path. The Bears can scheme up explosive plays in the passing game but aren't particularly consistent down to down, and I trust Green Bay's passing game more at the moment. The Packers come away with a win here, but the Bears keep it close. Prediction: Packers 26, Bears 21Houston Texans at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5) (SNF)Dajani (Texans +3.5): If this number was Chiefs -1.5, I would take it. But if you're giving me the hook against a 6-6 team that has a losing ATS record, I'm probably going to side there. The Texans rank No. 1 in both scoring defense and total defense and allow an NFL-low 11.0 passing yards per game outside the pocket this season. That's usually where Patrick Mahomes thrives. Additionally, Houston is 4-0 in one-score games during this current four-game win streak. I didn't think C.J. Stroud was perfect in his return to the lineup last week, but he wasn't a disaster either. Houston loses by three points. Prediction: Chiefs 24, Texans 21\nDubin (Chiefs -3.5): I'm going down with the Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid ship. Prediction: Chiefs 23, Texans 16Philadelphia Eagles (-2.5) vs. Los Angeles Chargers (MNF)Dajani (Eagles -2.5): Yes, I have obvious questions about the Eagles as legitimate contenders, but I don't like that Justin Herbert is going to try to play days after having surgery for a fracture in his left hand. I actually really like getting the Eagles under a field goal here. Additionally, I was surprised to learn that the Eagles are 7-5 ATS this season while the Chargers are 6-6. Prediction: Eagles 27, Chargers 20Dubin (Eagles -2.5): The Justin Herbert hand surgery has me off the Chargers in this game. Even if they get Omarion Hampton back, I don't know how effective we can expect the offense to be -- even against a defense that has struggled the last two weeks. We know the type of ceiling Vic Fangio's unit can reach. Do I trust the Eagles' offense at all here? Nope. But I'll back the team whose quarterback at least is not injured. Prediction: Eagles 21, Chargers 17\n            ",

Injuries and inconsistent play limited Slay to just 10 games and nine starts during his lone season in Pittsburgh. He previously spent five seasons in Philadelphia following a seven-year run with the Detroit Lions.\nSlay is joining an 8-4 Bills team that is currently 2.5 games behind the New England Patriots in the AFC East standings. Buffalo is currently the No. 7 seed in the AFC playoff picture. \nAlong with Slay, Buffalo's secondary includes fellow veterans Christian Benford, Jordan Poyer, Cole Bishop, Tre'Davious White, Taron Johnson, and rookie first-round pick Maxwell Hairston. Through 12 games, the Bills rank 13th in the NFL in points allowed, first in passing yards allowed, 30th in rushing yards allowed, 13th in third down efficiency and 15th in red zone efficiency. Buffalo's defense is coming off of an impressive outing against the Steelers that included a strip-sack by Joey Bosa that resulted in a fumble return for a score by Benford, who also had an interception in the win. The Bills held the Steelers to just 166 total yards and 3 of 9 on third down. \nThe Bills are set to host the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday and will have their work cut out for them against a Cincinnati offense that is led by quarterback Joe Burrow and wideouts Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Whether Slay will be part of the plan to defend that trio only days after landing with the Bills remains to be seen. \n            \n    ",

And after undergoing surgery to stabilize the broken bone, there is a chance he could return to the lineup in Week 14.Herbert said Tuesday that the procedure -- which involved the insertion of a plate and multiple screws -- was successful. While the team considers him day-to-day and while he did not practice on Wednesday, Herbert said the plan is to \"prepare as if I'm going to play\" against the Philadelphia Eagles come Monday night. Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said the team is \"optimistic\" Herbert will be able to suit up. Herbert injured his hand on the Chargers' opening drive against the Raiders, which was capped by a 10-yard Quentin Johnston touchdown. The star signal-caller took a big hit from Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn on the play, and initially appeared to be OK. \nFollowing the opening scoring drive, Herbert exited the sideline and jogged to the locker room. Trey Lance took over at quarterback on L.A.'s next drive. When Herbert returned to the game that very same drive, he sported a large protective glove. \nHerbert completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception vs. the Raiders, and passed Dan Marino for the third-most passing yards (23,935) in a quarterback's first six seasons in NFL history. Los Angeles relied on its rushing attack Sunday, as Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson combined for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. While Herbert is pushing to play, he would need to wear a protective device on that injured hand if he suits up. And it remains possible that Lance could make his first start for L.A. in Week 14.\nThe former No. 3 overall pick of the San Francisco 49ers made one start for the Dallas Cowboys last year, a 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders in which he completed 20 of 34 passes for 244 yards. Lance is 2-3 in his career as a starter. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo's New Jersey home was pelted with eggs hours after Philadelphia's Week 13 loss to the Chicago Bears, according to police. A video on social media shows multiple people throwing objects at Patullo's home. The video includes audio of someone telling Patullo to \"get the f--- out of Philly.\" The Moorestown Police Department has stated that the investigation is ongoing.Patullo's home was vandalized following another tough outing for the offense -- scoring just 15 points while committing two turnovers while Saquon Barkley carried the ball just 13 times for 56 yards. Several days removed from the incident, Patullo, a first-year coordinator, told reporters that criticism comes with the territory of a high-profile job but anything involving a coach's family \"crosses the line.\"\"Unfortunately, it happened,\" Patullo said Wednesday. \"I've been here for five years now, and it's been awesome. This is such a unique place to coach and play. It's very special. We've been to two NFC Championship games. We've won at Lincoln Financial, a Super Bowl, the parade. It's an amazing atmosphere to be a coach and a player. And as coaches and players, we all know that part of our job is to handle criticism. It's perfectly acceptable to sit up here and talk about what's going on, how to fix it, what we're going to do going forward, and we know that. But when it involves your family, it obviously crosses the line. That happened, and at this point, we've just gotta move on.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 14 NFL picks: Packers cool off Bears in NFC North showdown, Cowboys keep rolling vs. Lions\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrough 12 games, the Eagles' offense is 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing, 22nd in rushing and 28th in third down efficiency. Philadelphia is getting it done in the red zone, however, as it is currently tops in the NFL with a 75.9% touchdown rate. While he said that he will evaluate everything following the loss to Chicago, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni is sticking with Patullo as his offensive play-caller. Patullo, 44, has been on Sirianni's staff since he took over back in 2021. Patullo previously served as the team's pass game coordinator. He was promoted to offensive coordinator when Kellen Moore left to coach the New Orleans Saints. \"I have confidence in the entire group,\" Sirianni said. \"I know it will keep coming back to Kevin. If I thought it was one thing, I'd make those changes. Obviously, it's a lot of different things. I don't think it's Kevin.\"\nDespite their offensive struggles, the Eagles will head into their Week 14 with the Los Angeles Chargers with an 8-4 record and in first place in the NFC East. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. women's national team is settling in for a long winter's nap after capping off the year with a pair of wins. The Stars and Stripes closed out 2025 with two victories against Italy and plenty of growth to reflect upon. Under the guidance of head coach Emma Hayes, 2025 was a year of player pool expansion and intentional experimentation, laying the groundwork for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. The squad will have December as time off before reconvening in January for the annual New Year camp. The unofficial window may not include certain European club players at the time, as January camps often fall outside of an official international window. That opens the door to even more extended looks at players, or re-evaluation of those already regular cast members in the expanded pool. Now the page turns towards a new year, and the World Cup qualifiers are officially less than a year away with the Concacaf W Championship set to take place in November 2026. With so many new players integrated into the program at the senior level and the U23 team, who are the ones that will make the coaching decisions increasingly difficult? We've already have a 2027 World Cup roster projection, so for this exercise, most players from the 2024 Olympic squad will not be considered. Only athletes who either earned more caps, made their debuts, and earned first-time call-ups, or have not been with the squad for an extended period of time will be categorized.\nHere's who I think is a World Cup qualifier lock, on the bubble, or on the outside looking in, for now.Locks for qualifiersGoalkeepers: Phallon Tulis-Joyce, Claudia Dickey They're the only pair of goalkeepers to earn two consecutive starts during any of the international windows, and they're both coming off big club seasons. Tulis-Joyce recently sustained a fractured eye socket that kept her out of end-of-year camps and Manchester United's recent Champions League window, but she has seven clean sheets in the tournament dating back to qualifying rounds. Dickey earned NWSL second-best XI honors and was a finalist for goalkeeper of the year. Defenders: Tara McKeown, Avery Patterson A solid club season for Patterson, though the Houston Dash's slow start hampered playoff chances. Still, the fullback made a good impression whenever she earned minutes with the USWNT, and it can't all fall upon Emily Fox. The centerback position gets a little trickier. Here's the truth: if Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson, and Emily Sonnett are all healthy and ready to go come November qualifiers, then McKeown's battle as a depth option is up against Emily Sams. \nMidfielders: Lily YohannesPart of 2025 has also been the hampering of any expectations for a young midfielder. Hayes has been vocal about taking off the pressure for the 18-year-old, but that's been difficult to do when Yohannes keeps showing off her vision and skillset.\nForwards: Alyssa Thompson, Catarina Macario If the door is open for the Olympic gold medal-winning \"triple espresso\" attacking line of Sophia Wilson, Mallory Swanson, and Trinity Rodman to return in 2026, then they have finally some added cavalry in tow. After missing out on time with the national team for nearly all of 2024, Thompson has become a constant starter for Hayes. Also coming off a discouraging 2024 is Macario, who removed herself from Olympic selection after making the roster due to injury concerns.Now, Macario is nominated for female player of the year after functioning as a false nine in Hayes' system with seven goals and two assists. It's her best year in a USWNT kit since coming back from an ACL injury; she started nine games with her goals scored against Colombia, Brazil, China, New Zealand, and Italy.\nOn the bubbleGoalkeepers: Mandy McGlynnMcGlynn began the year with starting minutes, but those dwindled over the year with the emergence of Tulis-Joyce and Claudia Dickey's form. She's still a regular call-in as part of the goalkeeper core and will likely remain if she keeps up consistent club performances. Defenders: Lilly RealeReale has only a limited number of senior appearances (six, per Opta), but her minutes (449) rival fullback Avery Patterson's (518), while Reale has fewer appearances (six) this year. This is a positive for the program, as the outside back role has often been a point of concern over a lack of depth, but now there are options.Midfielders: Jaedyn Shaw, Olivia Moultrie, Claire HuttonSome good problems are emerging for Emma Hayes and her staff. Both Shaw and Moultrie are players who began the year as part of the U23 squad, and were examples of player profiles by Hayes as players who could be ready now vs. players who could be ready later.\nForwards: Michelle CooperHow does one buy stock in Cooper? Let me know immediately. I rate her that highly. I think the USWNT coaching staff also rates her. Quite possibly the best example of the U23 integration, Cooper got time in January 2025 futures camps, earned a spot on the national team in February and never gave it back. A late-season injury kept her out of the Kansas City Current's playoff appearance and the final international window of the year, but she played 10 games for USWNT, with one goal and two assists, all while being a wrecking winger in the process. OutliersGoalkeeper: Jordan SilkowitzWhile Bay FC had a challenging season that led to an early elimination from playoff contention, goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz was a bright spot. The injury to Tulis-Joyce opened a spot, and if the Bay keeper maintains form, maybe Silkowitz will be that fourth depth chart keeper. \nDefenders: Kennedey Wesley, Gisele Thompson, Jenna Nighswonger, Crystal DunnFirst and last time Jenna Nighswonger made a camp roster was in January. Crystal Dunn was in March. Safe to say their moves to Europe have not panned out in terms of actual minutes played, despite the experiences of being overseas. It's good to see the U23 program work in both directions between senior call-ups and continued development. Wesley is a centerback who started in the U23s in 2025 but aged out later in the year. She eventually earned senior call-ups to close out 2025. Though that might look different now that Girma is healthier and back in the mix. Wingback Gisele Thompson had a promising start to the year but missed out on camps due to injury, and she might be one of those \"ready later vs. ready now\" type of players Hayes had referred to in the past.\nMidfielders: Ally SentnorA revamped U23 program means that players who could use more development have a place to do that outside of their clubs. After call-ups with the senior team, a midseason move from Utah to Kansas City changed the way Sentnor was utilized. It meant that a sophomore NWSL player was now on a club depth chart instead of the face of a team to end the NWSL season. She was part of the U23 side that recently defeated England, 4-2, and she scored a goal in the second half. Don't be surprised if her extra minutes and overseason experience boost her back into the senior mix.Forwards: Emma SearsI don't truly believe Sears is on the outside, so let's make that clear. There's just an abundance of attacking players in this program now, and only so many spaces on a World Cup qualifying roster. A lot will depend on the availability of \"triple espresso\" come November 2026, and even then, Thompson, Macario, and Cooper are forwards who might be in front of her on the depth chart. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a tale as old as (football) time: a wide receiver and a quarterback getting in a heated debate on the sideline during a game. The latest example came during the Cleveland Browns' 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.During the fourth quarter on Sunday, wide receiver Jerry Jeudy was seen clapping his hands as he and rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who was holding a tablet, discussed something on the sideline. Sanders then got up and appeared to shake his head as their conversation continued.Asked about the situation Wednesday, both said it was no big deal.\"We resolved that. We're not going to speak on that,\" Sanders said. Jeudy said the exchange was about a particular play from the game and the two have since moved on. \"We spoke about it. We're good,\" Jeudy said. \"It's an emotional sport. Things like that happen. It's football.\"\n\n\nIn retrospect, Jeudy said he and Sanders \"probably\" could have spoken away from the camera. \"That's probably what I would have done differently,\" Jeudy said. \"I'm going to speak my mind and say what I see out there, but it is what it is. It's football. Me and Shedeur good. Stuff like that happens.\"Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said the situation was handled internally.\"Football is an emotional sport and certainly when you're a family like we are, you can have your disagreements. Sometimes they're for everybody to see. Sometimes it's behind closed doors. But like a family, we move on, we talk about it, so not worried about it,\" Stefanski said.Jeudy had three receptions for 26 yards as the Browns fell to 3-9. Jeudy set career highs in receptions (90) and receiving yards (1,229) in 2024, but has struggled this season. He has just 35 catches for 421 yards and one touchdown this season as the Browns have had a revolving door at quarterback. \nSanders, a rookie fifth-round pick out of Colorado, is the third QB to start for Cleveland this season. He started the season behind veteran Joe Flacco leaving and rookie third-round pick Dillon Gabriel. But after Flacco was traded and Gabriel was sidelined by a concussion, Sanders was given an opportunity and is set to make his third start of the season Sunday when the Browns host the Tennessee Titans. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff selection committee made a move that raised some eyebrows in its penultimate rankings by swapping Alabama and Notre Dame for the No. 9 and No. 10 spots, respectively. The Fighting Irish, despite walloping rival Stanford 49-20, slipped behind the Crimson Tide in a changing of places that left coach Marcus Freeman puzzled.Alabama won a rivalry game of its own but was not nearly as dominant in a 27-20 Iron Bowl victory over Auburn. The Crimson Tide won by a smaller margin than the Fighting Irish, and its caliber of opponent only marginally better than Auburn, which finished the regular season with just one more win than Stanford. How was that enough for the committee to be convinced that Alabama deserved a higher ranking than Notre Dame? That is the question Freeman is left pondering.\"Obviously you're disappointed, but more so because of a little bit of confusion,\" Freeman said Wednesday. \"You're confused in terms of what we could have done differently and why we fell when we won 49-20. I think we were up 42-6 going into the fourth quarter. I don't spend time talking about other teams, but it's just like, OK, what could we have done differently? I don't know.\"\n        \n            \n                A College Football Playoff bracket without Alabama, Notre Dame or any ACC team? How this scenario could happen\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt surface level, a one-spot difference in the top 25 is hardly sizable. But given where Notre Dame and Alabama stand in the race for inclusion in the 12-team playoff bracket, one spot could be the margin between competing for a national championship and watching the CFP from home.\n\"You always look for cause and effect,\" Freeman said. \"You look for a reasoning why you go up or you fall. For me, you didn't see a great explanation for why we fell when we had the performance we did last Saturday.\"If the favorites in this weekend's conference championship games win, Notre Dame will be in position to hold the final at-large spot in the bracket. But if No. 11 BYU defeats No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game and becomes a \"bid stealer\" of sorts, the Fighting Irish would likely be the team bounced from the projected bracket.CFP committee chair explains controversial rankingsArkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek, who stepped into the CFP selection committee chair position last month, offered an explanation for the swap at the No. 9 and No. 10 spots. Now in his second year on the committee, Yurachek said the debate in the room between Notre Dame and Alabama over the last three weeks has been among the strongest he has witnessed during his CFP service.\n\"I think this week, as we looked at those two teams and how closely they have been over the past three weeks -- Notre Dame went on the road and had a strong win at Stanford, but Alabama went on the road in a rivalry game, looked really good,\" Yurachek said on Tuesday's rankings show. \"I think that was enough to change the minds of a couple of committee members to push Alabama up ahead of Notre Dame in this week's rankings.\"\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: What 12-team field looks like after fifth CFP Rankings released\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne possible explanation for Alabama's climb to No. 9 is that the committee may have sought to protect the Crimson Tide from falling out of the bracket in the event it loses to No. 3 Georgia the SEC Championship Game. The committee set a precedent in previous years that it wishes not to punish title game losers for falling short in a 13th data point.Yurachek, however, said that was not a consideration for this week's rankings and instead would be discussed after the championship games are complete.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens made a significant move on Tuesday, firing coach John Harbaugh after 18 seasons. Harbaugh, the winningest coach in Ravens history, immediately vaults atop the list of available coaching candidates. How attractive is Harbaugh on this coaching carousel? His agent, Bryan Harlan, said he received calls from seven different teams expressing interest in Harbaugh 45 minutes after the news broke, per ESPN. There are just seven jobs open currently, and the Ravens didn't call about their former coach. That means there's an NFL team out there right now considering firing their own coach for a shot at Harbaugh.Who could that team be? The Miami Dolphins have not fired Mike McDaniel following a disappointing 7-10 campaign. He is 35-33 during his four seasons in South Beach, but 0-2 in the playoffs. Todd Bowles thinks he has done enough to keep his job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after three straight NFC South titles, but how does the organization feel about him moving forward? \nMaybe Jerry Jones makes an aggressive move for the Dallas Cowboys, or could the Cincinnati Bengals move on from Zac Taylor and seduce Harbaugh with star quarterback Joe Burrow and the idea of coaching against his former team twice a year?\n        \n            \n                Ravens fire John Harbaugh: Five landing spots for Super Bowl champion coach, including team with no vacancy\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nApart from the Ravens, there are six franchises searching for new head coaches: the New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, Atlanta Falcons, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns and Arizona Cardinals. And there apparently is already a team to watch, as ESPN reports that Harbaugh is expected to emerge as the favorite for the Giants.\nYou can understand why teams are excited about the prospect of hiring Harbaugh. He is the winningest coach in Ravens history, going 180-113 during his time in Baltimore, won Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, and was named NFL Coach of the Year in 2019. Harbaugh has won eight road playoff games over his career, which are the most by a coach in NFL history. However, the Ravens have struggled in the playoffs over the last 12 seasons, winning just four games. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Washington star quarterback Demond Williams Jr. announced that he was entering the transfer portal on Tuesday night. Williams will have a do-not-contact tag when he officially enters. In a post shared to social media, Williams thanked Washington coaches, teammates and fans before announcing his departure.\"I have to do what is best for me and my future,\" Williams wrote. After much thought and prayer, I will be entering the transfer portal.\"News of Williams' intention to enter the portal comes just days after the star QB signed a new deal to return to Washington for the 2026 season. The Huskies are prepping to pursue any and all legal avenues to enforce the terms of that contract, according to ESPN. Sources tell CBS Sports' Matt Zentiz and Chris Hummer that LSU will be one of the teams to watch as Williams explores other options in the portal. The Tigers do have a need at quarterback, especially after Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss chose to remain with the Rebels instead of following Lane Kiffin to Baton Rouge should he be granted a waiver for an extra year of eligibility that's still pending.\nOne of the best available playmakers hits open marketAs a sophomore in 2025, Williams ranked sixth in the Big Ten with 3,065 passing yards, and his 25 touchdown passes ranked fourth. He also showed off his mobility with 611 yards and six touchdowns on the ground. Williams did all that while leading Washington to a 9-4 record, which included a win over Boise State in the LA Bowl.Coming out of high school in Arizona, Williams was a four-star recruit and the No. 19 quarterback in the 2024 signing class, according to 247Sports. Although Williams didn't start for most of his true freshman season, he did play in every game before starting starting in the final two. His skill was evident, and he built upon that with a big 2025 season.In 26 games with the Huskies, Williams completed 71.5% of his throws for 4,009 yards, 33 touchdowns and nine interceptions while adding 893 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.\nBehind Williams, the Huskies don't have a ton of experience at quarterback. The only other quarterback to attempt a pass for the Huskies this past season was Tulane transfer Kai Horton, who completed four of seven passes for 13 yards.\n            ",

Tate, a projected first-round pick, caught 51 passes for 875 yards and nine touchdowns in 11 games this season for the Buckeyes, who were eliminated from the College Football Playoff in the quarterfinals last week by Miami.Tate, who ranks No. 5 overall in CBS Sports' NFL Draft prospect rankings, missed three games this season due to injury and closes out his collegiate career with 121 catches for 1,872 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nDuring the Buckeyes' national championship run in 2024, he recorded 52 receptions for 733 yards and four touchdowns. The junior crossed 100 yards receiving in four games this season, including a nine-catch, 183-yard explosion against Minnesota in October.Listed at 6-foot-3, 195 pounds, Tate is CBS Sports' No. 2 wide receiver behind Arizona State's Jordyn Tyson. In Mike Renner's most recent mock draft, Tate is the first wide receiver off the board, going to the Washington Commanders at No. 7 overall. \nLast year, Ohio State became the first school to ever have a wide receiver drafted in the first round in four straight years with Emeka Egbuka, Marvin Harrison Jr., Jaxon Smith-Njigba plus Garrett Wilson and Chris Olave in 2022. The Buckeyes will likely make it five straight years come April before Jeremiah Smith joins that group in 2027. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- As Isaac McKneeley's contested 3-pointer ricocheted off the rim right to Duke's Dame Sarr with just under 14 minutes left in the Blue Devils' 84-73 win vs. Louisville on Tuesday, Cardinals coach Pat Kelsey turned and slammed both hands on the courtside table behind him. Kelsey could see a potential marquee victory slipping away from the Cardinals and had some frustration to let out. Duke had outscored Louisville 14-6 in the second half and was methodically taking control in a critical ACC battle the Cardinals once led by 12.Just 15 seconds later, the defensively resurgent Blue Devils took their first lead en route to a victory that established No. 6 Duke firmly atop the conference pecking order.The No. 20 Cardinals, who started 7 of 10 from 3-point range to ignite a crowd of 17,656, went cold in the second half. By the two-minute mark, Louisville fans streamed toward the exits, resigned to Duke extending its winning streak in the series to eight.\nStar freshman Cameron Boozer turned in another dominant performance with 27 points and eight rebounds to lead the Blue Devils, and coach Jon Scheyer was quick to note that \"what he's doing is unbelievable.\" But as great as Boozer was, and as great as the 43 points from the supporting duo of Isaiah Evans and Caleb Foster were, Tuesday's result stood out for something else entirely.\nDuke's defense, which was mired in its worst stretch since Scheyer's playing days, rediscovered its identity.\n\n        \n            \n                Trotter's Trends: Building a game plan to try and stop Michigan, explaining Duke's slipping defense\n                \n                    Isaac Trotter                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"They were as explosive as any offense we've played this season,\" Scheyer said. \"No question about it. The game really came down to, I think our defense in the second half was terrific.\" Duke's return to the basicsDuring their 11-0 start, Duke ranked No. 6 in defensive efficiency. But something changed in the second half of an 82-81 loss against Texas Tech on Dec. 20, as the Red Raiders shot a blistering 62.1% while erasing a 17-point deficit.The shoddy defense continued in uncomfortably close wins over projected ACC bottom feeders Georgia Tech and Florida State over the past week. Those three games marked the first time since February 2009 that Duke allowed three consecutive opponents to shoot 53% or better.\n\"We've gone through it,\" Scheyer said, adding that the Blue Devils spent Monday working on \"basic defensive drills\" for the sake of rebuilding good habits.\"Guarding the ball, moving as the ball moves and being in a stance,\" Scheyer explained, rattling off principles that might also be taught at Scheyer's summer youth camps.Even after that return to the basics, it was more of the same in the first half at Louisville, as sharpshooter Ryan Conwell drilled his first three 3-pointers. Then, reserve center Aly Khalifa got in on the fun by hitting his first three 3-pointers as the Cardinals opened up a 26-14 lead.\nThat's when Boozer put his foot down. Duke's freshman phenom responded with a quick 3-pointer of his own and scored 10 points over an 8-minute span to help keep the Blue Devils in touch.\n\"In that first half, he just settled us,\" Scheyer said. \"If he didn't do that, it could have gotten out of hand.\"The freshly settled Blue Devils regrouped at halftime and showed why they must be regarded as a Tier 1 threat to win the national championship.\nUnsung heroesCollectively, the trio of Boozer, Evans and Foster keyed Duke to a sterling 70.8% shooting performance in the second half. But offensive brilliance is nothing new for the Blue Devils, nor was Louisville's defensive susceptibility any grand revelation.That's why, in the same breaths that he used to praise his star trio for their production, Scheyer also credited Dame Sarr and Maliq Brown. The duo combined for just six points off the bench, but they played pivotal roles in slowing Louisville's offensive barrage to a crawl.A Cardinals team that hit 10 of 21 from 3-point range in the first half hit just 2 of 17 after halftime, and it wasn't because they suddenly forgot how to shoot. Clean looks that abounded in the first half dissipated for Louisville as Duke extended its defense, became more active and dared the perimeter-oriented Cardinals to try and score inside the arc. Sarr and Brown helped spearhead the charge.\n\"They're two of the best defenders I've ever been around,\" Boozer said. \"What they do for our team, it might not show up in the box score. But you definitely feel it throughout the game.\"The strong defensive effort came with a caveat, as Louisville star freshman and offensive maestro Mikel Brown Jr. missed his fifth straight game due to a back injury. But given how strong Louisville looked in the first half without Brown, there was plenty to glean from Duke's second half defensive effort.Conwell, who got to his spots at will in the first half, finished 0 for 4 from deep in the second half.\n\"With a guy like him, you want to make him work for it,\" Scheyer said. \"I think the first two threes he hit were clean looks. So that wasn't good. That was on me, not our guys. That was on me. But I thought just the fight, the discipline to make him score over the top…I think it was more about the fight and the effort by Dame, by Caleb and by Isaiah in the second half to really guard.\"More tests await in an ACC that has more teeth in 2026 than it did last season, when Duke cruised to a 19-1 mark in league play. Though the Blue Devils passed what may go down as their toughest road assignment of conference play by taking down the Cardinals, they can't rest on their laurels. The next challenge is Saturday against SMU, which is the league's highest-rated offensive team not named Duke or Louisville. The Mustangs hung 97 on North Carolina last weekend.But Duke took a big step back in the right direction against Louisville. Boozer played an unbelievable game. That's to be expected at this point.\nWhat was less certain, especially after the first half, is whether the defense would return for the first time in weeks. It did, and the Blue Devils demonstrated their championship-level potential in the process.\"We did some things in the second half that I thought was Duke defense,\" Scheyer said. \"How can we build from that and be true to who we are and what's made us really good so far?\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The whirlwind of quarterback movement at Nebraska could be over at last, as the Cornhuskers secured a transfer portal commitment from former UNLV standout Anthony Colandrea. The Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year committed to Nebraska on his visit Tuesday.Colandrea's arrival marks a pivot for Nebraska, which over the weekend appeared to have its quarterback situation for 2026 sorted out. Former Notre Dame signal-caller Kenny Minchey committed to the Cornhuskers on Sunday but flipped his pledge to Kentucky a day later, leaving Matt Rhule in search of another starting option.Rhule has his man in Colandrea, who is tasked with replacing two-year starter Dylan Raiola. Raiola, a former five-star recruit, helped elevate the Cornhuskers out of an extended bowl drought, but Nebraska still remains in search of a true breakout season after going 7-6 in each of the last two seasons. Raiola entered the transfer portal at the end of his second campaign in Lincoln.Colandrea brings three years of starting experience to Nebraska and has the potential to be one of the Big Ten's most dynamic quarterbacks. He was a prolific runner at both UNLV and Virginia and made strides as a passer during his lone season with the Rebels. His 3,459 passing yards led the Mountain West, and his 23 touchdowns were a career high. He also cut down on his turnovers in 2025, throwing nine interceptions across 14 games. That was a major step forward for a gunslinging quarterback who racked up 20 picks over the previous two years.\nNebraska offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen will have a dual-threat weapon on his hands for the first time in Lincoln. Raiola, while adept at avoiding pass rushers, was a pocket passer in every sense of the term. While Colandrea is not as refined of a thrower as his predecessor, his skill set could unlock something in a relatively stale Cornhuskers offense.Targeting a mobile quarterback seems to have been a priority for Rhule and Holgorsen, as Minchey was also set to bring notable rushing ability to the program before he flipped his pledge to Kentucky.\nColandrea is a three-star prospect in the 2026 transfer portal cycle, per 247Sports, and ranks as the No. 21 quarterback and No. 175 player overall.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Motor sports have skyrocketed in popularity over the last few years, which has brought mainstream sports fans to F1 betting and NASCAR betting through pop culture. We'll take a look at how sportsbooks operate when it comes to motor sports, how bettors can wager on racing events and go over some of the best strategies and tips when it comes to racing betting.Finding the best sportsbook promos for motor sports bettingHere's a look at some of the promotions going on at top sportsbooks for fans interested in getting into motor sports betting.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst Bet Matched up to $250 as a Bonus Bet Win or LoseCBS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanaticsBet and Get Up To $2,000 in Bet Insurance FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $200 in bonus bets win or loseCBSBET365DraftKings, FanDuel and bet365 are all offering \"bet and get\" promotions where users get bonus bets after wagering $5 or more. FanDuel requires a user's first bet to win, while DraftKings and bet365 provide bonus bets regardless of the outcome of the qualifying bet.BetMGM and Fanatics Sportsbook are also giving out bonus bets but in a different way. BetMGM covers a user's first bet up to $1,500 with bonus bets if that first bet loses, but users must wager at least $1,500 to be eligible for the full amount. Fanatics has shifted its promotion to specific days where users can wager up to $100 on football and receive bonus bets back if their wager loses.Caesars Sportsbook has gone offers a first bet match up to $250 as a bonus bet, win or lose. The first bet must have minimum -500 odds. Before you get into motor sports betting, it's important to find a sportsbook which consistently provides odds for races. There's always value in shopping around multiple sportsbooks for the best lines, but some platforms do not offer extensive betting markets for motorsports compared to others.What do motor sports odds mean?When it comes to motorsports and racing markets, odds are displayed and read similarly to how they are for most sports. Let's say a driver is priced at -150 to win the Dutch Grand Prix on Aug. 31, and the next best driver has +200 odds. That means the driver at -150 is a decent favorite to win, and you'd have to risk $150 to win $100. The second driver is a contender but is unlikely to win in the eyes of oddsmakers, but you'd win $200 after risking $100 if he does indeed pull off the upset.When you can bet on motor sports oddsThe racing schedule varies across NASCAR, F1 and IndyCar but there are usually weekly races with occasional breaks. NASCAR has multiple series, so there's usually at least one race across the series every weekend. F1 has a set calendar for the year with some breaks in between, but there are junior Formula racing series which might be going on in some of the gaps on the main circuit.Typically, the actual race will take place on a Sunday. There will be practice on either Thursday or Friday, with a qualifying event to set up the grid on either Friday or Saturday depending on the race schedule. Qualifying usually takes place the day before the race. Bettors can wager on qualifying outcomes as well, and those results will shift the race odds.Biggest races for motor sports bettingNetflix's \"Drive to Survive,\" NASCAR's Chicago Street Race and big-budget films like Ford v. Ferrari and F1: The Movie have brought a new audience to racing, and that means more action when it comes to racing betting. Arguably the biggest sporting event in the racing world is the Indianapolis 500, which is traditionally held on Memorial Day weekend. That's the premier IndyCar event.NASCAR has several big races, with the Daytona 500, a Crown Jewel event, regarded as the richest race on the circuit. The Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and the Brickyard 400 are also considered Crown Jewel events. Talladega Speedway is a widely known track thanks to the movie \"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\" but it is not a Crown Jewel event.Every F1 race has its unique twist, as the tracks are different in each city, but Monaco is considered the biggest spectacle of the season. The race itself is somewhat mundane, as there's little opportunity for drivers to pass each other. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Italian Grand Prix at Monza and the Singapore Grand Prix are considered some marquee events on the F1 calendar. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is also a high-profile event as it is typically last on the calendar and could decide who wins the drivers championship and constructors championship. F1 has also added special events like Miami and Las Vegas.Types of bets and how motor sports betting works Like all sports betting markets, there are a variety of ways prospective bettors can wager on motor sports. Here's a look at some of them.Outright/To Win oddsThis market is straightforward. Users are betting on which driver will win the event. There are also markets here for which team/constructor car will win the event, which will have multiple cars involved.Placement/Top Finish oddsMotor sports betting offers users the ability to wager on drivers or teams having a certain placement or finishing within a certain range. For example, you can wager on drivers to place in the top 5 or top 10 of the event. You can do the same with teams/constructors.While it rarely occurs in racing, there's a possibility of multiple drivers tying for a position. In this case, technically there are multiple winning bets but sportsbooks grade dead heats differently and the payouts can be different. If FanDuel declares a dead heat, half the stake is applied at the original odds and half the stake is lost. If there are more than two dead heats, the stakes are proportioned accordingly.Dual ForecastThis is where bettors can place a wager on which drivers will finish first and second. Both drivers must finish in the correct order for this wager to be paid out as a win. For example, you can wager on Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to finish first and second, respectively in a Dual Forecast market in F1 betting. However, if Verstappen finishes second and Hamilton finishes first, your bet will lose even though you did correctly pick the top two drivers for the race.Each Way BettingThis might not be as common in motor sports but can be applied to racing betting. An each way bet basically places two wagers: a driver to win and to finish above another position. If the driver wins, both bets get paid out. The same applies for team bets in this market.Stage WinnerThis is prevalent in NASCAR and IndyCar, which has more laps than Formula One. You can bet on which driver or team will be in the lead after 25 laps, 50 laps, 100 laps and so on. These are the stages.Matchups/Head-to-HeadSportsbooks will put two drivers or two teams against each other and bettors can choose which one will place higher. For teams, the bet is usually on the highest-placed driver for that particular team. For example, if a market was being offered on F1 to see if Ferrari or Mercedes placed higher, a winning Ferrari driver would give Ferrari bettors the win even if the Mercedes drivers combined to finish higher than the Ferrari drivers.Group WinnerThis is offered in NASCAR. Sportsbooks will put a handful of drivers in groups and ask which will be the winner of the group.Top Car Make DriverThis is also specific to NASCAR, where you can bet on whether the winning driver will be in a particular car manufacturer, like Ford or Chevy. It's more applicable here since there are only two drivers on each F1 constructor, while car brands can span several NASCAR teams.Team of Race WinnerThis is similar to Outright Winner for drivers but applies to teams and constructors.Qualifying BetsBettors can wager on who will take pole position and which cars will be on pole. These are determined during qualifying racing, which typically takes place the day before the race. You can also bet on markets offering odds for who will finish in the top 5 or top 10 in qualifying, though these necessarily aren't available for every race. The results of qualifying will often shift the race odds.Motor sports futures bettingFormula 1 bettingIn most cases, F1 futures usually apply to the next race. However, you can bet on season-long futures for the drivers and constructors championships. The drivers championship is straightforward as it will be given to the driver who accumulates the most points over the season. The constructors championship takes into account the points for both team drivers. Only the top 10 finishers in each race score points, and those points are tallied over the season. The winning driver can be part of a constructors championship, but that's not always the case.NASCAR bettingNASCAR has different portions of the season. There are also different circuits like the Cup Series, the Xfinity Series and Truck Series. You can bet on marquee races for NASCAR in the futures market, and you can also wager on winners for these particular series.IndyCarThe major marquee futures market for IndyCar is the Indianapolis 500. Other than that race, there's season-long championship odds for the circuit.Can you parlay wagers in motor sports betting?While parlaying is generally not advised as you don't get appropriate odds from sportsbooks which correspond to the actual chance of your bet winning, you are able to parlay outcomes in motor sports betting. While you can't pick multiple drivers to win an event in a parlay, you can pick multiple drivers to finish in the top 5 or top 10. You can also pick teams to finish in the top 5 or top 10.How to bet on motor sports live during a raceSportsbooks do offer live odds for motor sports, though this is likely a more prominent feature for NASCAR and IndyCar as opposed to F1. Driver and team odds will shift based on where they are in the grand scheme of the race. NASCAR and IndyCar allow for more leeway since there are more laps, while F1 can sometimes shift quickly towards one driver or team.Tips and strategies for how to bet on motor sportsDriver form does matter when it comes to racing, but the biggest predictor of success is usually how each team can adjust to conditions. Races can take place in all kinds of weather and team strategy can make or break the day. There are some teams that struggle to adjust, and bettors should know which teams those are before placing wagers.Historical track success does matter, but it often takes a back seat to current form. For example, Max Verstappen won the Canadian Grand Prix three years in a row and was a contender after starting second behind George Russell in 2025. Russell has had mixed results in Montreal historically but wound up winning the race after winning qualifying to take pole position.Longshots don't usually win races, but it's not uncommon to see them do well in the Placement markets. You can usually back drivers who have had success on certain tracks or who have routinely finished just outside of a certain position market to break through eventually.Occasionally, a caution flag comes out when there's a crash on the track, which makes racing conditions hazardous for everyone. When this happens, there will be a safety car deployed, and all drivers must line up behind the safety car until the wreck is managed. This has sometimes happened on the last lap of the race, which can completely eliminate the leader's edge on the field. There are different rules for each association and sometimes the race organizer makes a call in the moment, but usually, the race cannot end on a caution flag. If the wreck is too big to clear in a reasonable amount of time, the race will end despite the caution flag being signaled. Overtime doesn't really exist, but usually there will be at least one additional lap of racing should the fallout of the crash get removed in a timely manner and the safety car gets taken off the track.FAQCan you bet on motor sports?As long as you are of legal age in a state where sports betting is legitimate, you should be able to find a sportsbook which provides racing and motor sports odds.Who to bet on for the Indy 500?Because the Indy 500 typically takes place over Memorial Day weekend, you'll have to wait for a bit before placing wagers on who will win the signature event. Josef Newgarden won the Indy 500 in 2023 and 2024 but Alex Palou won in 2025 and is the reigning champion.Can you bet on SuperCross?SuperCross is a type of motorcycle racing and some sportsbooks do offer SuperCross odds in certain states.Can you bet on motocross at DraftKings?DraftKings does provide SuperCross odds, which is a motocross competition, in select states. You must be of legal age and residing in those states to bet on motocross at DraftKings.\n            ",

The Red Raiders recently celebrated the addition of top transfer quarterback Brendan Sorsby with advertisements posted in Times Square. Texas Tech posted a welcome message on Times Square's famous digital billboards. \nSorsby is the gem of Texas Tech's 2026 transfer haul thus far. The former Cincinnati star ranks as the No. 2 player nationally and the No. 2 quarterback in 247Sports' Transfer Portal Rankings. He reportedly commanded a price tag of $5 million in name, image and likeness revenue, making him the highest-paid quarterback in college football. Sorsby enters his final year of collegiate eligibility after a breakout season with the Bearcats. The former Indiana starter initially transferred to Cincinnati ahead of the 2024 season and led the Bearcats to a 7-6 record in 2025 while throwing for 2,800 yards and a career-high 27 touchdowns to just five interceptions. He also rushed for 580 yards, a new personal best, and nine touchdowns while averaging 5.8 yards per carry. Texas Tech hopes that Sorsby can maintain its modern resurgence under coach Joey McGuire after the Red Raiders, who went all-in on the 2025 portal, won a Big 12 Championship Game and earned a top-four seed in the College Football Playoff. \nTexas Tech is also betting on Sorsby elevating its offensive ceiling. The Red Raiders were held scoreless while managing just 215 total yards of offense in their CFP debut against Oregon. Quarterback Behren Morton completed 18 of his 32 pass attempts for 137 yards with two interceptions. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Red River Rivalry will carry an extra ounce of intrigue in 2026 after former Texas wide receiver Parker Livingstone announced his commitment to Oklahoma through the transfer portal on Tuesday. Livingstone, a roommate of Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning, should be a key piece of the Sooners' aerial attack next season.Livingstone -- a four-star prospect and the No. 16 wide receiver in the transfer portal, per 247Sports -- insinuated when he entered the portal on Jan. 3 that it was not solely his decision to leave Texas. Just three days later, he found a landing spot within the SEC.\"Never in a million years did I think I would be going into the portal looking for a new home,\" Livingstone said. \"Some things are out of my control. Such is the reality of the ever-changing landscape of college football. Emptied my tank every day for this great university, my teammates & all of the good folks of Texas. Grateful.\"Manning and Livingstone connected 29 times for 516 yards and six touchdowns during the 2025 campaign as both climbed into the starting lineup for the first time. Livingstone, who did not record a catch in his true freshman season, redshirted in 2024 and brings three years of eligibility to Oklahoma. Barring a shakeup in the Sooners' quarterback group, he will catch his passes next year from incumbent starter John Mateer.\nLivingstone was the fourth-leading receiver at Texas during his lone year in the lineup, and he would have ranked fourth in catches and yardage for the Sooners if his 2025 production came at Oklahoma. He could immediately be the top target for the Sooners if Isaiah Sategna III declares for the NFL Draft. Deion Burks exhausted his eligibility, opening the door for Livingstone to at least replace one of the team's two standout receivers.Oklahoma saw Livingstone up close and personal in October when it lost, 23-6, to Texas. The receiver hauled in two catches for 29 yards.Jumping to the other side of the rivalry means Livingstone will shift allegiances in a series with which he was highly familiar as a longtime Texan. The Lucas (Texas) Lovejoy product said earlier this year that he attended a Red River Rivalry game before his commitment to the Longhorns.\n\"You come here, you come to the game, you hear about the game, you're from Dallas,\" Livingstone said in October. \"It's everywhere for a month before the game even happens. I really think it helps out tremendously in recruiting. It's a great reason. My senior year, I came here for the game, and it was an unbelievable atmosphere. I was like, 'I want to play in the burnt orange. I want to be on the right side.'\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Imagn Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Former Dallas Cowboys coach and current television analyst Jason Garrett will interview on Friday for the Tennessee Titans coaching job, according to multiple reports. He is among the numerous potential candidates to replace Brian Callahan, who was fired by the Titans midseason after he opened the 2025 campaign with a 1-5 start.Garrett has not been a head coach since 2019 and last worked on the sidelines in 2021 as the New York Giants' offensive coordinator. The 2016 NFL Coach of the Year spent the entirety of his head-coaching career with the Cowboys from 2011-19, where he went 85-67 and won three NFC East crowns. Garrett, 59, was linked to college jobs after his New York ouster but never returned to coaching. He has been a regular on NBC's NFL and Notre Dame football broadcasts since 2022.\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these seven jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile he logged double-digit wins in three separate seasons with the Cowboys and received a long leash from owner Jerry Jones, Garrett's tenure flamed out after multiple years of inconsistency and a failure to advance deep in the playoffs. Dallas reached the postseason just three times throughout his tenure and never made it beyond the divisional round.\nGarrett's two-year run as the Giants' offensive coordinator was highly underwhelming. New York ranked No. 31 in points and yardage in both seasons, leading to a midseason firing in 2021.The failed run as the leader of the Giants' offense and the inability to contend for Super Bowls with high-end offensive talent in Dallas raises questions about Garrett's fit in Tennessee. The Titans would undoubtedly benefit from a bright offensive mind capable of developing rookie quarterback Cam Ward, and Garrett would be a risky hire in that regard.The Titans also requested or scheduled interviews with Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo and former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, according to various reports. They opened their interview process with Morris on Monday and are expected to continue their process at least through the weekend with Stefanski set to interview on Saturday.\nIt remains to be seen how large of a player Tennessee will be in the John Harbaugh sweepstakes. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 years on Tuesday, making him the immediate top available candidate on the market for the six open jobs.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Oregon has chased this moment for decades, cycling through eras defined by innovation, near-misses and a bit of recalibration. Now, as the Ducks prepare for the College Football Playoff semifinal against No. 1 Indiana at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta, the path to the program's first national championship no longer feels theoretical. It feels earned.Since Dan Lanning arrived in Eugene before the 2022 season, Oregon has built a consistent identity and trajectory that few programs in the country can claim: three straight seasons with at least 12 wins. Last year, the Ducks flirted with a breakthrough on the national stage, climbing to No. 1 in the rankings for much of the season, securing a Big Ten Championship and entering the CFP with an unbeaten record. But their run ended in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal against eventual national champion Ohio State.That loss stung not because it derailed the season, but because it revealed precisely where the Ducks still needed to improve: physicality against elite opponents and consistent execution in high-pressure moments.Fast forward to 2025, and Oregon has returned to the national conversation, this time with those lessons fully integrated into the roster, coaching approach and overall game plan.\nThe progress is no accident.Oregon is the only one of the four remaining CFP semifinalists with top-15 national recruiting classes in each of the past four cycles: fifth in 2025, third in 2024, ninth in 2023 and 13th in 2022. That doesn't even account for strategic transfer portal additions that have filled gaps and provided immediate impact. The Ducks entered the season ranked fifth in 247Sports Team Talent Composite. The other semifinalists? Miami (15th), Ole Miss (21st) and Indiana (72nd).After coming up short in previous title runs, including the near-misses of 2010 and 2014, the Ducks won't let this opportunity slip away again. Here are three reasons why Oregon is positioned to seize that long-awaited national championship.More CFP predictions: Why Ole Miss can win it all | Why Indiana can win it all | Why Miami can win it all\nBalanced excellence on both sidesChampionship teams aren't one-dimensional. Among the four remaining CFP semifinalists, only Indiana and Oregon rank inside the top 20 nationally in both offensive EPA per play and defensive EPA per play against FBS opponents this season. The Ducks are also the only semifinalist in the top 20 for both explosive play rate and limiting opponent explosive plays against FBS opponents. This balance gives Oregon multiple ways to win: they can sustain drives and grind in a possession game or flip a matchup with big plays when needed. Efficiency and Explosiveness (vs. FBS only)TeamEPA/PlayDef EPA/PlayExplosive RateOpp. Explosive RateIndiana0.25 (5th)0.20 (2nd)13.8% (18th)10.3% (t-31st)Oregon0.16 (t-15th)0.14 (t-6th)14.9% (t-9th)7.5% (2nd)Ole Miss0.19 (t-8th)-0.01 (t-54th)13.4% (t-23rd)10.7% (t-39th)Miami0.13 (t-23rd)0.14 (t-6th)12.2% (t-48th)8.3% (t-7th)In a national semifinal environment where every possession matters and mistakes are magnified, that versatility is invaluable -- Oregon is equipped to succeed regardless of how the game unfolds.Peach Bowl could determine the CFP championAccording to FanDuel's hypothetical national championship odds, Oregon (and Indiana) would be favored over both Ole Miss and Miami in the CFP title game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens -- a de facto home game for the Hurricanes. The Hoosiers are the toughest opponent standing between the Ducks and their first national title.Oregon already faced Indiana earlier this season in Eugene, falling 30‑20 in a game where Indiana physically dominated. If there's any doubt that Lanning will use that experience as motivation, consider the circumstances: Indiana coach Curt Cignetti has openly acknowledged how difficult it is to beat the same team twice in a year, admitting the previous result actually gives Oregon the edge.The Big Ten has set the standard in recent years of the CFP, winning the last two national championships: Michigan (2023) and Ohio State (2024). Both programs reached that breakthrough only after coming up painfully short the year prior. The Big Ten is guaranteed to have a finalist for the third year in a row and there's no reason Oregon can't be the next program to carry that banner.Best pass defense remaining in CFPFor all the attention Oregon gets for winning the lines of scrimmage, its secondary is what can truly disrupt opposing offenses and force them into one-dimensional play. The Ducks boast a 64.8% success rate on pass plays against FBS opponents, tied for third in the country and 6.1% higher than the next best CFP semifinalist, Ole Miss (58.7%).And yes, their first-round opener against James Madison was an outlier: while they allowed 323 yards and two touchdowns, it came on 49 pass attempts and quarterback Alonza Barnett III completed just 49% of his throws. Against high-powered Texas Tech, Oregon's secondary dominated, allowing only 137 yards on 32 attempts (4.3 yards per pass) and forcing two interceptions from Brandon Finney Jr. in the shutout.That same ability to generate turnovers and disrupt timing will be critical against Indiana's Heisman-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who Oregon got to at times in the first meeting, including a pick-6 that easily could have led to a win for the Ducks.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe two preseason favorites in the ACC collide on Tuesday when the No. 6 Duke Blue Devils square off against the No. 20 Louisville Cardinals at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville.In the fall, Duke was voted the preseason favorite to win the ACC. Louisville finished second in the voting.So far this season, the Blue Devils (13-1, 2-0 in ACC) have stumbled only once, a one-point loss to Texas Tech in New York City last month. Meanwhile, the Cardinals (11-3, 1-1) have lost two of their last four games while playing without star freshman point guard and future pro Mikel Brown Jr. (lower back injury). Brown already has been ruled out of Tuesday's game against Duke.Tonight's game is a rematch of last season's ACC Tournament championship game, which the Blue Devils won 73-62. Duke has dominated the series recently, winning seven in a row, including three straight at the Yum! Center. Louisville hasn't beaten the team from Durham since February 2021. The Blue Devils are 1.5-point favorites over the Cardinals on Tuesday.While Duke-Louisville is the marquee attraction on Tuesday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes six NBA games and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Tuesday, Jan. 6. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 6 Duke at No. 20 LouisvilleTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Louisville | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Duke -107\nThe Cardinals own the fourth-best offense in the country (126.7 points per 100 possessions), but that offense has been built on the shoulders of Brown, a projected NBA lottery pick. His absence will make that end of the court more of a struggle. In addition, Louisville isn't built to defend a player like the Blue Devils' Cameron Boozer. The 6-foot-9, 250-pound future lottery pick ranks third in the nation in scoring (23.0 points per game) and 21st in rebounding (9.8). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Blue Devils have a 53% chance to win and assigns a 'C' grade to the Duke money line (-107).No. 14 Texas Tech at No. 7 HoustonTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Houston -6.5\nJust how loaded is the Big 12 this season? Of the top nine teams in the Top 25, four hail from the Big 12. One of those is the seventh-ranked Houston Cougars (13-1, 1-0 in Big 12), who were this close to winning the national championship last year. On Tuesday, they will host the surging and 14th-ranked Texas Tech Red Raiders (11-3, 1-0), who have won four in a row and are the only team in the country to have beaten Duke this season. Under coach Kelvin Sampson, the Cougars have continued to play stifling defense, ranking eighth in the nation in defensive rating (94.2 points per 100 possessions). They're capable of slowing down JT Toppin, Tech's reigning Big 12 Player of the Year, and a Red Raiders team that will be playing just its second true road game this season. The SportsLine Projection Model says Houston has a 57.0% chance to cover and gives a 'C' grade to Cougars -6.5.TCU at No. 22 KansasTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Lawrence, Kan. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kansas -8.5\nPerhaps the best soap opera on television is \"All My Jayhawks,\" starring Darryn Peterson. If you haven't been watching Peterson, he's a dynamic three-level scorer who's in contention to be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NBA Draft. He's been in and out of the lineup for Kansas (10-4, 0-1 in Big 12) with injuries that remain not entirely clear. Will he play? If he does play, how long will he play? On Saturday, Peterson was brilliant, scoring 26 points. But he strangely sat out the final 11 minutes of the Jayhawks' 81-75 loss to UCF. Based on Kansas coach Bill Self's comments on Monday, there's no reason to believe that Peterson will miss tonight's game against TCU (11-3, 1-0), but his workload is anyone's guess. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Jayhawks have a 73.0% chance to cover and assigns a 'B' grade to Kansas -8.5.NBA best bets, where to watchHeat at TimberwolvesTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Minneapolis | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 238.5\nAfter ending 2025 losing three of four games, including at ugly 24-point blowout loss at Atlanta, the Timberwolves have kicked off 2026 with wins over the Heat and Wizards. On Tuesday, Minnesota (23-13) gets its second shot in four days at Miami (20-16) when the teams battle at the Target Center. Three days ago, the Timberwolves got 33 points from Anthony Edwards and 20 second-half points from Naz Reid for a 125-115 victory over the Heat. Tuesday's game features two of the top seven defensive teams in the NBA -- Miami ranks fourth (111.9), while Minnesota is seventh (112.7). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 55.9% chance the teams combine for 238 points or fewer and gives a 'B' grade to Under 238.5. Mavericks at KingsTime: 11 p.m. | Location: Sacramento, Calif. | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kings +5.5\nTwo teams looking to turn their season around will battle when the Sacramento Kings (8-28) host the Dallas Mavericks (13-23) at the Golden 1 Center. The Mavericks have lost six of their last eight games but are coming off a victory over Houston, though the Rockets played most of that game without Alperen Sengun. Meanwhile, the Kings have lost five in a row and 11 of 13. But one of those wins was a 113-107 decision over Dallas on Dec. 27. No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg has misfired over the last three games for the Mavericks, averaging just 12.3 points while shooting just 29.8% from the field. The SportsLine Projection Model says Sacramento has a 53.0% chance to cover and assigns a 'C' grade to Kings +5.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The end of the regular season doesn't just close the book on another year in the NFL. For some franchises, it also coincides with a reevaluation of the entire organization, which can result in various firings. While some clubs made changes midseason, the more common time we see head coaches and GMs be let go comes the day after the regular season concludes, better known as Black Monday. Already, we've seen five teams fire their now-former head coach (Falcons, Browns, Cardinals, Raiders and Ravens) and one club also rid itself of its general manager (Falcons). Pair that with the two head coaching vacancies (Giants and Titans) that were already open due to firings during the season, and quite a few jobs are opening up across the league. So, who fills them? With the Band-Aid ripped off, those teams are now beginning the process of finding their next leader. Below, we'll chronicle that pursuit by tracking the latest interview requests by each team. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Head coaches\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsPrevious head coach: Jonathan GannonAfter three seasons on the job, the Cardinals decided to move on from Jonathan Gannon. He went 15-36 as the organization's head coach, which included a 3-14 season in 2025. Arizona ended the year on a nine-game losing streak.

He had been with the organization in this GM role since 2021 and was able to add some intriguing skill position players like Bijan Robinson and Drake London, but was unable to get a concrete plan in place at quarterback.

He started as a scout in 2000 and stayed with the franchise ever since, ascending to GM in 2016.

    "body": "\n        Scoot over Kevin Stefanski and Klint Kubiak, there's a new most sought-after coach in the 2026 NFL coaching carousel: John Harbaugh. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 seasons (2008-2025) on Tuesday two days after losing the de facto AFC North championship game to the Pittsburgh Steelers on a missed field goal as time expired.Harbaugh's Ravens went 180-113 in his 18 seasons, good for the fourth-best in the NFL in that span behind only the New England Patriots (193-100), the Pittsburgh Steelers (183-108-2) and the Green Bay Packers (182-108-3). His 13 playoff wins are tied for the seventh-most in NFL history along with Mike Holmgren. Harbaugh's eight road playoff wins are the most in NFL postseason history. He helped lead Baltimore to the second Super Bowl title in franchise history with a victory in Super Bowl XLVII over the San Francisco 49ers to conclude the 2012 season. Harbaugh earned NFL Coach of the Year honors in 2019 when the Ravens produced a 14-2 record in quarterback Lamar Jackson's first of two NFL MVP campaigns. Blowing a 10-0 lead against the Steelers on Sunday night ended up being the final straw for Harbaugh, whose 26 blown leads of 10-plus points are the most by any coach since 2008 when he took over the Ravens' job. Twelve of them occurred over the last five seasons, which is five more than any other team in the NFL. After his 180 wins with the Ravens, the eighth-most by any coach with one team in NFL history, Harbaugh will now be arguably the most coveted coach of this NFL hiring cycle. Here's a look at his top five landing spots now that he is available.\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these seven jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland Browns If Harbaugh desired to go the petty route, he could remain in the AFC North with the Cleveland Browns after they fired Kevin Stefanski. Cleveland needs a breath of fresh air after the doom and gloom trading for and extending quarterback Deshaun Watson brought their franchise. Harbaugh oversaw the drafting and development of quarterback Joe Flacco, who won Super Bowl XLVII honors, and Jackson, who won NFL MVP honors in 2019 and 2023. Coaching soon-to-be two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year edge rusher Myles Garrett after he just broke the league's single-season record with 23.0 in 2025 could be very appealing. He'll just need to help Cleveland navigate a successful search for a franchise quarterback after hitting on two with the Ravens in Flacco and Jackson. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons are perhaps the most win-now option of the current NFL coaching vacancies given their young talent and being in the NFC South, a division the Carolina Panthers won with a losing record (8-9) in 2025.\nRunning back Bijan Robinson, at 23 years old, led the NFL in scrimmage yards (2,298). Wide receiver Drake London, 24, has flashed No. 1 wide receiver potential at times. Tight end Kyle Pitts, 25, is showing progress after producing a career-high 88 catches, the second-most in the NFL among tight ends in 2025. Defensively, the Falcons had the 2025 rookie leader in sacks and quarterback pressures (edge rusher James Pearce Jr. with 10.5 sacks and 45 quarterback pressures), the No. 2 2025 rookie leader in sacks (edge rusher Jalon Walker) and the 2025 rookie leader in interceptions (safety Xavier Watts with five). That's a strong foundation for a team whose division is up for grabs every season. If Harbaugh can help the Falcons get the quarterback position right, Atlanta could be a contender for years to come.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York Giants The New York Giants have their hopeful quarterback of the future in place with 2025 first-round pick Jaxson Dart. He ended his rookie year on a high note with 230 yards passing and two passing touchdowns while completing 22 of his 32 throws for a career-high 110.2 passer rating in a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys. Pro Bowl wide receiver Malik Nabers will be back for Year 3 fully recovered from a torn ACL. \nPro Bowl edge rusher Brian Burns finished second in the NFL in sacks with 16.5, and the Giants also have Pro Bowl defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence in the middle with 2025 third overall pick edge rusher Abdul Carter developing on the other side of the defensive line as well. If Harbaugh wants to coach what is arguably the most talented defensive line in football with some offensive playmakers already in place, the Giants make plenty of sense. It will be interesting to see if he would want to work with general manager Joe Schoen or if he would prefer entering a new team with a general manager he already possesses an established rapport with. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas Raiders The Raiders are a blank slate Harbaugh can mold in his own image since they have the 2026 NFL Draft's first overall pick. He can handpick his preferred quarterback between Oregon's Dante Moore and Indiana Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza. \nHe would be pairing one of those passers with 2024 sixth overall pick running back Ashton Jeanty. Jeanty is the first rookie in NFL history with 900-plus rushing yards (975), five-plus rushing touchdowns (4) and five-plus receiving touchdowns (5). Plus, 2024 first-team All-Pro tight end Brock Bowers, who will be in just his third season in 2026. Five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Maxx Crosby is also a fantastic defensive foundation block. However, the AFC West is a gauntlet with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos, the playoff-bound Los Angeles Chargers and Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsThe Miami Dolphins still employ coach Mike McDaniel, but there's a chance that could change with Harbaugh's availability flipping the whole NFL coaching carousel upside down. Team owner Stephen Ross is a huge fan of the Harbaugh family as a prominent University of Michigan alum: the university's business school is named after the Dolphins owner. That could lead to Ross moving heaven and earth to land Harbaugh. Miami already has a general manager vacancy, so the Dolphins could offer Harbaugh the chance to pick his own GM.\nMiami will be headed toward a rebuild in 2026 and 2027 with the failed nature of the Tua Tagovailoa era that netted zero playoff wins, which could put the Dolphins in prime position to draft University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning in 2027. That setup, plus the opportunity to live in South Florida as Harbaugh enters his mid-60s, could be quite appealing. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan State picked up its 13th win of the season in an 80-51 rout of USC on Monday, with Coen Carr leading the Spartans in scoring with 18 points. In a game the Spartans dominated throughout, the biggest piece of drama to emerge from a comfortable win happened in the Breslin Center stands, where former Michigan State star Paul Davis got ejected from the game by an official -- with the support of Tom Izzo. Davis was a few rows from the court and got on an official over a call and crossed the line with what he said, which Izzo heard from across the court -- Izzo clarified after the game that it \"wasn't something racial, it wasn't something sexual.\" The Michigan State coach gave Davis a \"what the f--- are you doing?\" before joining the official in pointing him toward the exits. \nDavis spoke Tuesday at Michigan State's media availability and offered an apology to the officiating crew, the Spartans' coaching staff and team, the university, USC and the fans. He said he had a conversation with Big Ten official Jeff Anderson to apologize for a mistake he said will \"never happen again.\"\"Yesterday shouldn't have happened, but today needs to happen,\" Davis said. \"I'm not up here to make any excuses. I'm up here to take accountability, to own it. There's a lot of people that have known me. Some have been here for 25 years. They know that's not me, but last night was.\"\nIzzo was clearly non-plussed by Davis' actions and discussed what happened with the media after the game. \"You know I love Paul Davis. I really do. He's one of my favorite guys,\" Izzo said. \"He's always calling and doing things. But what he said, he should never say anywhere in the world. And that ticked me off. So, just because it's 25, 20 years later, I'm going to have to call him tomorrow and tell him what I thought of it. And you know what he'll say? 'I screwed up, Coach. Sorry.'\"[Davis] kind of got after the official and he was 150 percent wrong,\" Izzo continued. \"And for a guy like me to 150 percent agree with the official, it's almost illegal. So I feel bad because he did that because he's been a guy that comes back a lot and we've got to keep him coming back. He made a mistake.\"\nDavis played center for Michigan State from 2002-06, averaging 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game in his senior season. 20 years removed from his playing days in East Lansing, he still drops by games and on Monday got a bit too into the action to earn an ejection from officials and some admonishment from his former coach. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe first chance to make an NFL SGP comes in the Week 16 'Thursday Night Football' contest between the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks. With L.A. 8-2 ATS over their last 10 matchups, backing the Rams (-1.5) to cover will be popular in a TNF same-game parlay, as will money line NFL bets, as Los Angeles has outright won seven of those 10. But your Seahawks vs. Rams SGP can also include NFL player props featuring the likes of Matthew Stafford, Sam Darnold and Puka Nacua.If this game is anything like their Week 11 meeting, then NFL prop bets may target Darnold and his interceptions. He threw four picks in the earlier loss to the Rams, so backing Over 0.5 interceptions with NFL prop odds of -147 could be attractive. There also may be Rams wideouts poised to hit their Overs with Davante Adams (hamstring) doubtful. Before locking in any Rams vs. Seahawks picks for your 'Thursday Night Football' SGP, be sure to see the Seahawks vs. Rams prop predictions powered by SportsLine's Machine Learning AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Darnold over 0.5 interceptions.

If you successfully parlay its picks, you'd be looking at a payout of 6-1. You can only see the Machine Learning Model player prop predictions for Los Angeles vs. Seattle here.\nTop 'Thursday Night Football' SGP picksAfter simulating Seahawks vs. Rams, SportsLine's Machine Learning Model says Seahawks wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba goes Under 89.5 receiving yards (-114). Smith-Njigba's pace has slowed a bit after a blistering start. He averaged 119.4 receiving yards over his first 11 games, putting him on pace for a 2,000-yard season and the most in a year in NFL history. However, he's averaging just 76 receiving yards over his last three games and has to face one of the NFL's toughest defenses.The Rams have the No. 3 scoring defense and rank in the top 10 in yards per completion allowed and passing rating allowed and defensive sacks. Plus, with Darnold's four picks leading to the Rams beating Seattle in Week 11, there's a good chance the Seahawks lean more on the ground game this turn around. Add in that there's a nearly 90% chance of rain for Thursday night in addition to wind gusts as high as 35 m.p.h., and the passing game will be further hampered. Smith-Njigba is projected to have 73.9 receiving yards in a 4.5-star NFL prop that could be a part of a winning Thursday Night Football SGP. See which other TNF same-game parlay picks to make here.You can bet Smith-Njigba to go under 89.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make Rams vs. Seahawks SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has eight other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your Seahawks vs. Rams SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Thursday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top TNF same-game parlay picks you should target with your Rams vs. Seahawks predictions?

Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in Seattle. L.A. has won four of the last five overall matchups, as well as four of the last five meetings in Seattle. The latest Seahawks vs. Rams odds have Seattle as 1.5-point home favorites, while the over/under for total points is 42.5, a 4-point drop from opening at 46.5 as both heavy rain and winds are expected at kickoff. Both teams are 10-4 against the spread this season.

They have won seven of the last 10 games, while covering in eight of those contests. The Rams defense flustered Sam Darnold into four interceptions in Los Angeles' Week 11 win, which is Darnold's most picks since his infamous \"seeing ghosts\" game in 2019. While both teams rank in the top five in both scoring offense and scoring defense, the biggest difference between the two lies in giveaways and takeaways. Los Angeles' +9 turnover differential ranks in the top five of the NFL, while Seattle has a -1 mark as it's committed the second-most turnovers (23) in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine, and bet Darnold to go Over 0.5 passing interceptions at DraftKings here:\nWhy the Seahawks can coverA major component of L.A.'s offense is out in Davante Adams (hamstring), who leads the league in receiving touchdowns. That will make things easier for an already elite defense, as Seattle is No. 2 in points allowed and allows the fewest yards per pass attempt and second-fewest yards per rush attempt. The Seahawks are equally as potent through the air on offense as they are in defending the pass on defense, as Seattle leads the NFL in yards per pass attempt. Thus, it connects on big passing plays like no other team, and the Rams' defense is exploitable in that area. L.A. just allowed its second-most passing yards (326) of the season in Week 15, while the Rams gave up their most points of the year (34) in that contest. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks picksHartstein has analyzed Seahawks vs. Rams from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

    "body": "\nA divisional battle takes place on 'Thursday Night Football' as the Seattle Seahawks host the Los Angeles Rams at 8:15 p.m. ET. Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) missed practice on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, leaving him doubtful for tonight. With Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Puka Nacua ranking first and second, respectively, in receiving yards, NFL DFS stacks with their respective quarterbacks will be a popular daily Fantasy football strategy. However, Sam Darnold had four picks when these teams met in Week 11, while Matthew Stafford had just 130 passing yards. So, your NFL DFS strategy shouldn't bypass the ground games as both squads use multiple running backs.  Potential NFL DFS picks out of the backfield include Kenneth Walker III, Zach Charbonnet, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. It's all about getting the most value relative to cost when choosing options from the TNF DFS player pool. The weather forecasts call for an 87% chance of rain with wind gusts of 35 m.p.h., which could affect your NFL DFS strategy. Before making any Rams vs. Seahawks DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings for 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.\nMcClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the 'Thursday Night Football' DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. Top NFL DFS picks for Seahawks vs. RamsOne of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for 'Thursday Night Football' is Rams wideout Puka Nacua. Despite missing one full game, and half of another, Nacua is second in the NFL in both receptions (102) and receiving yards (1,367). The third-year receiver is coming off his best game as a pro with a career high of 181 yards on Sunday versus Detroit, which came just a week after posting a 7-167-2 stat line. Nacua had 93 total yards versus Seattle in their matchup earlier this year.. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Nacua to go Over 7.5 receptions at DraftKings, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nMcClure is also rostering Seahawks tight end AJ Barner, who was heavily featured in Week 11 versus the Rams. He had season highs in targets (11) and receptions (10), while his 70 receiving yards were one shy of matching his career high of 71. For the season, Barner has scored 5 touchdowns as part of his 43 catches and 413 receiving yards. With the Rams having a top-10 run defense, and allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns of any team, as opposed to the No. 19 pass defense, Seattle could lean on an aerial attack. That boosts Barner's value, who also scored a touchdown in his last game versus the Rams in the 2024 season. See who else to roster at SportsLine. Bet Barner to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nHow to set Rams vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.'

    "body": "\nFormer NASCAR driver Greg Biffle was among the several people killed Thursday in a plane crash at Statesville Regional Airport in North Carolina. NASCAR confirmed that three of Biffle's family members were also killed in the tragic accident. His wife Cristina, daughter Emma and son Ryder were among the victims. Dennis Dutton, his son Jack and Craig Wadsworth also died in the crash.The plane, which crashed during a landing at approximately 10:15 a.m., was registered to a company that Biffle owned.Flight tracking data shows the plane took off from the airport around 10 a.m. but returned and attempted to land at the Charlotte-area airport. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed that six people were aboard the Cessna C550 and that there were fatalities associated with the crash.\"NASCAR is devastated by the tragic loss of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, son Ryder, Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton in a fatal plane crash,\" NASCAR said in a statement. \"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many. His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.\"On the track, Greg's talent and tenacity earned him championships in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series, as well as numerous wins and accolades in the NASCAR Cup Series. Beyond his racing career, he gave of himself for the betterment of our community. Most notably, Greg spent countless hours of his time helping the citizens of North Carolina during the disasters that followed Hurricane Helene. His tireless work saved lives. Our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to Greg's entire family, friends, and all who were touched by his life.\"In the years following his exit from racing, Biffle was involved in humanitarian efforts in North Carolina and headlined the many NASCAR figures to assist in 2024 with Hurricane Helene recovery. Biffle flew a private helicopter into the affected region of Western North Carolina to deliver supplies and internet service to those stranded.\"It's heartbreaking,\" North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a press conference. \"Just heartbreaking. I just learned about it 20-30 minutes ago. I don't know that we know the number of casualties. Obviously a number of people were impacted. Our hearts go out to those families. No more tragic way to walk into the holiday season.\"Biffle, 55, drove in 515 races over a 16-year NASCAR Cup Series career. He racked up 19 wins and 175 top-10 finishes. He competed numerous times for the Cup Series championship.

    "body": "\nIt would be nearly impossible for the San Francisco 49ers to miss the playoffs at this point in the 2025 NFL season. The same was being said about the Indianapolis Colts eight weeks into the campaign, but here we are.The Colts were sitting pretty in the postseason picture after winning seven of their first eight games, but the wheels have fallen off the wagon since then and their playoff hopes have significantly diminished. Indianapolis will find itself in an almost must-win situation when it hosts San Francisco at Lucas Oil Stadium in Week 16 at 8:15 p.m. on Monday Night Football.The 49ers (10-4) could have their ticket to the postseason already punched by the time they take the field, as they would secure a berth if the Detroit Lions lose to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. Should Detroit win that contest, San Francisco could earn a playoff spot by defeating Indianapolis.Things are much convoluted for the Colts, who have lost four consecutive games, five of their last six and their starting quarterback for the year. Already playing with a fractured left fibula, Daniel Jones -- who was having an impressive comeback season -- suffered a torn right Achilles tendon in the team's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 14, ending his campaign.Backup Riley Leonard replaced Jones in that contest and injured his knee, leaving Indianapolis scrambling ahead of its Week 15 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks. With 2023 fourth overall draft pick Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve with a fractured orbital bone, the Colts coaxed Philip Rivers out of retirement and fed him to the wolves, AKA Seattle's top-five defense.Indianapolis' offense registered just 220 total yards and the 44-year-old Rivers, who last played in the NFL with the Colts in 2020, completed 18-of-27 pass attempts for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception. The eight-time Pro Bowler still had the team in position to win as it took a one-point lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter, but Seattle's Jason Myers set a franchise record with his sixth field goal of the game with 18 seconds remaining and the Seahawks held on for an 18-16 triumph.\nThe loss kept the Colts in third place in the AFC South and dropped them to eighth in the conference standings. Despite their recent misfortunes, there's a possibility they enter Monday night with their postseason destiny in their own hands.On Sunday, the AFC South-leading Jaguars visit the conference-best Denver Broncos, the Los Angeles Chargers take on the Cowboys in Dallas and the division-rival Houston Texans host the Las Vegas Raiders. If either Jacksonville, Los Angeles or Houston loses, Indianapolis could soar right into the playoffs by winning its final three games.SportsLine's Inside the Lines team believes that even with a loss in Week 16, San Francisco is a virtual lock for the postseason, even if passing the Los Angeles Rams and Seahawks to win the NFC West title is far-fetched. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the 49ers currently have more than a 96% chance to make the playoffs, and they would drop by less than 3% should they fall to the Colts.The model says Indianapolis' prospects for a postseason berth are less than 14% entering Monday's contest and fall below 6% with a setback against San Francisco.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCESan Francisco 49ers96.7%100.0%94.0%6.0%Indianapolis Colts13.7%29.8%5.8%24.0%CHANCES OF WINNING NFC WESTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCESan Francisco 49ers12.6%20.0%2.4%17.6%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC SOUTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCEIndianapolis Colts1.7%2.2%1.3%0.9%The road ahead certainly is a tough one for the Colts, and even though they won't be eliminated from playoff contention with a loss on Monday, it will make qualifying even more difficult. But if they receive help from just one of the three aforementioned teams on Sunday, their only concern will be posting victories against the 49ers, Jaguars and Texans in their final three games.Indianapolis owns a 27-19 record in the all-time series against San Francisco and has won each of the last five meetings, including a 30-18 triumph in 2021. Jonathan Taylor, who leads the NFL in rushing with 1,443 yards, ran for 107 and a touchdown in that contest while receiver Michael Pittman Jr. made four catches for 105 yards and a TD.San Francisco is a 5.5-point favorite against Indianapolis in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings. The ITL team's model is predicting a 28-24 triumph by the 49ers, which would give them a playoff berth if one wasn't already secured by a Detroit loss on Sunday and put an enormous damper on the Colts' postseason hopes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Jake Paul isn't taking many shortcuts against Anthony Joshua. The two are set to throw down on Friday after Paul moved on from his original opponent, Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis, Paul vs. Joshua is a professional boxing match, unlike the exhibition fight that Paul was previously working towards. This means the result will impact their pro records. Paul (12-1, 6 KOs) and Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) will wear the standard 10-ounce gloves used by heavyweights. Paul has competed in 10-ounce gloves for most of his career, excluding the unusual 14-ounce gloves used for his fight with \"Iron\" Mike Tyson. Against Davis, Paul was planning to wear 12-ounce gloves.  The fight will be contested at heavyweight, stripping Paul of his normal weight advantage against opponents. Paul normally competes at cruiserweight, 65 pounds higher than WBA champion Davis' usual weight class. Paul's only previous heavyweight fight was against Tyson, who was 30 years older than Paul. However, there is a stipulation that says Joshua cannot weigh more than 245 pounds for the bout.\n\n        \n            \n                Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua fight predictions, undercard, odds, start time for showdown in Miami\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"People don't like the fact that I'm fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. But if we look at the people that don't want me to be here, but they want me to put an end to Jake Paul's show, I understand it and that's why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.\"Perhaps the only stipulation benefiting Paul is the round totals. Joshua has exclusively competed in 12-round fights for the last decade, excluding a 10-round maximum for his short fight with Francis Ngannou. His fight with Paul is scheduled for eight three-minute rounds. With many believing Joshua will knock out Paul, this reduces the time Paul must theoretically survive.\nPaul is preparing for undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career. The crossover star made a career by seeking opponents whose name value greatly outweighed their boxing experience, or who were significantly older or smaller than him. Though Joshua is 36 and likely beyond his prime, he should possess everything necessary to make short work of his opponent. Joshua is a two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist. Last year, he knocked out former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou in two rounds after Ngannou took Tyson Fury to a split decision.Paul vs. Joshua takes place on Saturday inside Miami's Kaseya Center.Who wins Anthony Joshua vs. Jake Paul on Dec. 19, and which massive longshot prop should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Friday, Dec. 19, heavyweight bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the majority of Fantasy Football leagues, over half of the league is done playing after Week 15. In redraft, that thought leads to only sadness. In Dynasty, it just means more Dynasty minds looking to the future. As I begin the process of working on my 2026 Dynasty rankings, which will be released on January 1st, I thought it might be helpful to look at some future risers and fallers in these rankings and in the trade charts.The first obvious risers will be the injured players. This is why we suggest rebuilders targeting young injured players in trades. I anticipate Cam Skattebo, Malik Nabers, Travis Hunter, Garrett Wilson, and Sam Laporta all ranking higher in January than they do right now. Guys like Tyreek Hill, Patrick Mahomes, Kyler Murray, and Daniel Jones may have to wait a few months as we get clarity on their 2026 status. There is a good chance Rashee Rice's rise is tied to Mahomes' health and the Chiefs offseason.Non-injury risers are harder to predict, but don't be surprised if Trevor Lawrence, Breece Hall, Omarion Hampton, and Michael Pittman get a boost. Luther Burden will be a fascinating case to watch this offseason. I could see a playoff performance for him that sends his value skyrocketing once his ankle injury is healed.\nThis week, we had Brian Simpson from QB List on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty. We talked about the best of the best at each position, including Josh Allen, Jahmyr Gibbs, Ja'Marr Chase, and Brock Bowers. Check it out:As for the fallers, we'll start with any running back over 28, any receiver over 30, and any free agents that aren't certain to land a starting role. That last category is the toughest to forecast, but Rico Dowdle is the first name that comes to mind. And it's possible that Travis Kelce completely disappears from the Dynasty radar if he decides to ride off into the sunset.\nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine. There you'll find trade values for both Superflex and One-QB trades to help you dominate your Dynasty league.Here are my updated Dynasty Quarterback Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Running Back Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Wide Receiver Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Tight End Rankings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the last big boxing events of the year is upon us. All eyes are on Miami as Jake Paul takes on his literal biggest test yet when he steps in the ring with former unified heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua. It all goes down on Friday night at the Kaseya Center and can be streamed live on Netflix.Paul has become one of boxing's biggest stars through careful matchmaking, expert promotion, world class training and solid athleticism. Over the last five years he's accumulated a 12-1 record by beating former UFC champions and stars with little boxing experience, smaller foes, and a nearly 60-year-old Mike Tyson.Joshua, meanwhile, is one of the sport's most decorated champions of his era. He earned gold at the 2012 Olympics before turning pro and earning the unified heavyweight titles. While he has yet to secure the desired matchups against Tyson Fury or Deontay Wilder, Joshua did have two chances against Oleksandr Usyk for the undisputed crown, but came up short in both instances.\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"\nBet Paul vs. Joshua at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Netflix's boxing return also features a clash of ex-mixed martial arts champions. Former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva boxes former welterweight champion Tyron Woodley in a six-round cruiserweight affair. The card also features three boxing title fights, including one for the undisputed women's bantamweight crown.\"The motivation is passion and love,\" Silva said at the final press conference. \"And I have my biggest idol [Roy Jones] here in front of me. I remember when I was watching Mr. Roy Jones fighting in the Olympic Games, I just looked and said, 'Whoa, one day I will become a champion the same as this man.'

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        One of the offseason's top free-agent starters is heading back to San Diego. Right-hander Michael King and the Padres have agreed to a three-year contract worth $75 million, reports MLB.com. King can opt out after 2026 and 2027. The team has not yet announced the signing. Here's the salary breakdown:2026: $5M salary and $12 million signing bonus2027: $28 million salary ($5 million buyout if opt out is used)2028: $30 million salary (no buyout if opt out is used)King, 30, spent the last two years with the Padres after coming over from the New York Yankees in the Juan Soto trade. In 2024, King struck out 201 batters and had a 2.95 ERA in 173 ⅔ innings, which earned him a seventh place finish in the Cy Young voting. Shoulder and knee injuries limited him to 73 ⅓ innings with a 3.44 ERA in 2025. We ranked King as the 17th-best free agent available this offseason, and the sixth-best free-agent starting pitcher. Here's the write-up: The book on King hasn't changed much over the years, even if his role  has shifted this way and that a few times. He has a quality arsenal  built on horizontal movement, and an undeniable track record of being a  plus performer. Unfortunately, he's a high injury risk who has topped 75  innings twice to date. There's no harm rolling the dice, but one should  be realistic about the expected outcome.  \tKing is something of the ideal modern pitcher, one with an extreme east/west pitching attack (i.e. sinkers and sweepers) but also an analytics-friendly four-seam fastball. He also has plenty of experience as both a starter and reliever, including as a multi-inning setup man familiar with high-leverage situations. Come postseason time, King has the versatility to help his team in any capacity. \nThe Padres made King the $22.025 million qualifying offer last month, which he rejected. They will neither gain nor forfeit a draft pick to re-sign him. Being attached to draft pick compensation may have hurt King's market, leading to him taking what amounts to a one-year contract with insurance policies for 2027 and 2028.\n            \n    ",

Adaway's attorney, B. Keith Jackson, said to The Washington Post that the Gamecocks running back filed a complaint on Dec. 12 accusing the trooper of assault. The Brazos County (Texas) District Attorney is considering whether to move forward with charges.Adaway's attempts to learn the trooper's name have come up short. Neither Texas A&M Police nor the Texas Department of Public Safety declined to provide identification, even after Adaway called campus police to report an assault. Adaway said he wants to know the trooper's name and to receive an apology.In the month since the game, Adaway said he has lost sleep over the incident and has seen a University of South Carolina sports psychiatrist because of the emotional distress.\"You see this sort of thing on TV -- different scenarios of police bullying people here and there -- but you never feel it and understand it until you're actually in the situation,\" Adaway said to the Washington Post.The incident occurred in the final minute of the second quarter after Harbor scored an 80-yard touchdown. Harbor ran through the end zone and partway up a tunnel while holding the back of his right leg in apparent discomfort. Multiple teammates, including Adaway, followed him into the tunnel and walked with him back toward the field. As they exited from the tunnel, the trooper walked the opposite direction, bumped into them and turned around to point at and say something to them.\nReactions to the incident poured in throughout the sports world. LeBron James was among the numerous prominent figures to comment on the situation.The Texas DPS relieved the officer of his game-day duties and sent him home after the incident.\"The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is aware of the incident that occurred today during the Texas A&M football game,\" the DPS said in a statement. \"The DPS Trooper involved was sent home from the game. Our Office of Inspector General (OIG) is also aware of the incident and will be further looking into the matter. No additional information will be released at this time.\"\nThe touchdown that preceded the incident gave South Carolina a stunning 27-3 lead over Texas A&M. The Gamecocks eventually extended their advantage to 30-3 before the Aggies rallied back for the largest comeback in program history, erasing a 27-point deficit for a 31-30 victory to remain undefeated at the time.\n            \n    ",

Los Angeles turned Seattle over four times in that game, so even though Seattle controlled time of possession (37:49 to 22:11) and outgained the Rams by more than 160 yards, L.A. pulled out the victory.The Rams have won eight of their past nine games, with their only loss during that stretch coming three weeks ago against the Panthers, in a matchup where they committed an uncharacteristic three turnovers. They have otherwise been winning most of their games fairly handily, and they have ascended to the No. 1 seed in the conference as a result.Seattle has also won eight of nine, with the only loss during that stretch coming to the Rams. It struggled offensively last week in its win over the Colts, and has generally been inconsistent on that side of the ball since the loss to L.A. in Week 11. The Seahawks are looking to avenge their loss here and overtake the Rams for the top seed.  Will the Rams strengthen their hold on their division and conference leads, or will the Seahawks get their revenge? We'll find out soon enough. But before we highlight some key storylines, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Where to watch Rams vs. SeahawksDate: Thursday, Dec. 18 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Lumen Field (Seattle)Stream: Prime VideoFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Rams -1.5, O/U 42.5 via DraftKings SportsbookKey storylinesPlayoff picture. The Rams are the No. 1 seed in the NFC and hold the lead over the Seahawks in the NFC West race due to their having won the first matchup between the two teams. If they capture a win here, they'll have almost wrapped up the division title, because they'll need to fall a full game behind Seattle in order for the Seahawks to win the division, and because they're already a game ahead of the 49ers and have an easier path to going 5-1 in division games thanks to the fact that they get the Cardinals in Week 18, rather than the Seahawks. Seattle, of course, can complicate things immensely for Los Angeles by pulling off the win here and sliding into the No. 1 slot in the conference. The MVP race. Matthew Stafford is the heavy favorite heading into the final three weeks of the season, with the odds implying that he has a 75% chance to win the award, which is pretty incredible. For him to keep this stranglehold on the award, the Rams probably need to hang onto the top seed in the conference down the stretch. Especially if he puts together a strong performance against a Seahawks defense that is one of the best in the NFL, he'll have the opportunity to create a really powerful narrative heading into the stretch run. Sam Darnold has an outside chance at crashing the party if he puts together a spectacular stretch run and the Seahawks take the No. 1 seed, but he's more likely to merit down-ballot votes in that scenario than to actually capture the trophy. Davante Adams injury. Adams has been nursing a hamstring injury and appearing on the injury report, and he appeared to aggravate the issue last week. He didn't practice in advance of this game and likely won't play here. In his absence, the Rams will almost surely funnel as many targets as possible to Puka Nacua, but they'll also likely utilize more of their multi-tight end sets. Colby Parkinson has been playing his best football lately and could be a big factor here. Sam Darnold vs. Chris Shula. Darnold is probably seeing Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula in his nightmares. He has had a terrible go of things in his last two matchups with Shula's defense: In Week 11, he threw four interceptions in a two-point loss to Los Angeles. In the playoff matchup vs. the Rams last year, Darnold was sacked a career-high nine times in an 18-point defeat. He has looked utterly lost in both games, seeing the kinds of ghosts that he did against Bill Belichick and the Patriots back during his days with the Jets. Unless he can figure out a way to exorcise those demons, the Seahawks are drawing dead here. Prediction\nEven without Davante Adams, I feel comfortable rolling with L.A. here. That's mostly because of what I expect to happen on the opposite side of the ball. Again, Darnold is probably seeing Shula in his nightmares given what has happened to him in their last two matchups. The Seahawks have also just not looked very good offensively for a few weeks now. I suspect we'll get a lower-scoring game here, but I like the Rams to win it. \nPick: Rams 20, Seahawks 16\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks tied the Los Angeles Rams in the fourth quarter off one of the strangest plays you'll ever see ... and yet another reminder to play through the whistle.Down 30-28 with 6:23 left in regulation, following Sam Darnold's touchdown pass to A.J. Barner, Jared Verse tipped away Darnold's screen pass to Zach Charbonnet on Seattle's two-point conversion attempt.At least, that's what it looked like.However, replays showed Darnold's pass was actually a backward pass and because Charbonnet picked the ball up in the end zone and the whistle hadn't blown, it counted as a two-point conversion. Replays clearly show the ball was traveling backward from between where Darnold released it and Verse tipped it away.\nCharbonnet's seemingly nonchalant action ended up being a huge shift.\nThe Seahawks were down 30-14 just moments before this touchdown, but Rashid Shaheed took a punt back 58 yards, the Seattle defense forced a three-and-out, and then Darnold led a quick touchdown drive. Then this play happened, completing a wild sequence that tied things up.\"Very interesting,\" Rams coach Sean McVay said. \"Didn't get a clear explanation of everything that went on just because of some of the timing of it ... [I've] never seen or never been a part of anything like that.\"The was the last score of the fourth quarter, but far from the final twist in an overall wild game. After missing a late field goal, the Rams scored first in overtime and kicked an extra point to go up 37-30. The Seahawks answered right back with a touchdown of their own and then converted the game-winning two-point conversion -- this one a much more traditional pass play from Darnold to Eric Saubert.\nThe Seahawks had been down 30-14 in the fourth quarter but converted three two-point conversions -- the first one a Darnold pass to Cooper Kupp -- to aid in the remarkable comeback. In the process, Seattle became the just the eighth team to convert three two-point conversions in a single game and the first since the Dallas Cowboys in 2020. Furthermore, the Seahawks became the first team ever to win a game on an overtime two-point conversion, and they also slid into the driver's seat in the race for the top spot in the NFC.\n            ",

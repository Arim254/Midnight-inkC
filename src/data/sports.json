He's shown off a solid kickboxing game, a lethal squeeze on his chokeholds and great durability and determination. Duncan fights with a hard-nosed style and refuses to be denied even when the fight isn't going his way. McKinney is an explosive finisher who is always dangerous. In his 17-7 pro career, McKinney's fights have gone past the first round just twice. He has never fought to a decision and has been finished in all of his losses. McKinney's flying knees and rear-naked chokes could put Duncan in danger, but I believe Duncan's mentality and physicality will give him the edge. If Duncan lands a heavy counterpunch in traffic, McKinney might not stand back up.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 323: Dvalishvili vs. Yan 2 picksVithlani has strong picks for Dvalishvili vs. Yan and other bouts on the UFC 323 card.

    "body": "\n        A spot in the College Football Playoff bracket is on the line for the No. 17 Virginia Cavaliers when they meet the Duke Blue Devils in the 2025 ACC Championship Game on Saturday. The Cavaliers finished the regular season 10-2 overall with a 7-1 ACC record. They now have an inside track for an automatic CFP bid as one of the five highest-ranked conference champions if they can get by the Blue Devils. A Duke win would create some chaos that very well could put James Madison in the field. Kickoff from Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte is at 8 p.m. ET. The Cavaliers are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Virginia vs. Duke odds, while the over/under is 58.5.

Now they are small favorites a few weeks later on the neutral field. The Cavaliers also have more to play for as they are in line to head to the playoffs with a win. A Duke win guarantees the unranked Blue Devils very little since there's a good chance they would not be one of the five highest-ranked conference champions. Virginia is a well-rounded squad that ranks second in the ACC in total defense and and fourth in total offense, so the Cavaliers are well-positioned to control this game and cover. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why Duke can cover Duke's defense has struggled at times, but the Blue Devils have an extremely explosive offense that can keep this game within the number. Duke ranks second in the ACC in scoring offense, and that's largely thanks to quarterback Darian Mensah, who has completed 67.5% of his passes this season for 3,450 yards, 28 touchdowns and just four interceptions. The running back duo of Nate Sheppard and Anderson Castle is one of the ACC's best, combining for 1,300 yards and 20 touchdowns on the ground. Cooper Barkate is one of the ACC's top receivers with a 63-978-6 line on the season. The Blue Devils appear to be the healthier team as well with Virginia ruling out 15 players and listing third-leading receiver Cam Ross among four players who are questionable. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Duke vs. Virginia picksSportsLine's model is going Under on the total.

    "description": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. – The first 48-team World Cup was always destined to have unique quirks but as FIFA closed out their week in Washington, D.C",
    "body": "\n        WASHINGTON, D.C. – The first 48-team World Cup was always destined to have unique quirks but as FIFA closed out their week in Washington, D.C., they came up with one final random twist for a week centered around Friday's draw. Representatives from the qualified teams gathered one last time on Saturday for a schedule reveal event, one so random that even president Gianni Infantino did not know what to call it when he entered the stage. The event, though, did serve a practical purpose – visiting national teams finally found out which stadiums they would play their opening games in, FIFA essentially splitting the experience of the luck of the draw in two parts.While head coaches waited to find out their exact opponents on Friday before pondering their side's strengths against their group stage foes, the major talking points from Saturday's schedule reveal were  the elements that await them regardless of the other team on the pitch. Whether they watched from up close or from a distance, many got a preview of a North American summer during this year's Club World Cup – a not-so-pleasant preview, to be exact. Hot and humid days were essentially experienced by all 32 club teams at the U.S.-based tournament, leaving World Cup coaches rooting for the best-case scenario in terms of logistics.Several got what they wanted and breathed a sigh of relief once the schedule was unveiled. The list included Germany's Julian Nagelsmann, who will open their World Cup against the Caribbean nation of Curacao at Houston's NRG Stadium, the first NFL venue to build a retractable roof. They will then take on Ivory Coast at Toronto's BMO Field and close out Group E action against Ecuador at MetLife Stadium in the New York suburbs in a match that kicks off at 4 p.m. local time.\"I think it's three good stadiums, climate [controlled] stadiums so it's more easy for us,\" Nagelsmann said. \"We're not used to this high temperature, less [so] than Curacao, but now it's in a climate [controlled] stadium, air conditions. It's more easy for us. Second game in Toronto, I think it's not that hot compared to Miami or other venues so at least the last game in New York, it will be very hot but … we'll try to travel as early as possible to the U.S. so that we can adapt to the temperature and we'll be very prepared.\"\nMuch like the temperatures, distance was top of mind ahead of a World Cup with a sizable geographic footprint. The 2026 tournament will be spread from coast to coast and features host cities as far north as Vancouver and as far south as Mexico City, which varies greatly from the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and the 2018 competition that was confined to Russia's western cities. Head coach Rudi Garcia considered himself lucky that Belgium will be confined to the west coast for their Group G games against Egypt, Iran and New Zealand. Belgium are targeting a base camp in Seattle following the draw.\"Our base camp will be the west coast so normally, we'll be in Seattle,\" Garcia said. \"We are lucky about that because we are in the west coast, but in the north of the west coast. Seattle, Vancouver, it will not be hot to play, just a long flight – or an important flight – to go to [Los Angeles]. Maybe it will be a little hotter but not so much. The particularity of our games, the two first games, is that we will play at noon, at 12 [p.m], so it's not so easy to prepare. We need to wake up the players earlier.\"Portugal were also on the receiving end of a favorable situation with two games at NRG Stadium – one against Uzbekistan and another against the winner of an intercontinental playoff – and a third at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, the last one a game against Colombia with a 7:30 p.m. local kickoff time that will at least ensure the sun will not be beating down on players. Head coach Roberto Martinez, a member of FIFA's technical study group during the Club World Cup, said the game-time conditions are just one part of navigating North America's unique summertime patterns.\n\"It really alerted me for many red flags and aspects we need to anticipate so from that point of view, it was essential to have that experience,\" Martinez said about the Club World Cup. \"Now, I stayed in Miami for a long time so we got to play in Miami. I'm really happy with that. We're going to play in Houston. … Red flags is the training times, what you should do in terms of the cooling breaks, in terms of the potential threat of a storm and logistics, where would you train before a game. There are many aspects with the logistics that are very unique, very different. It's never happened that three countries are organizing a World Cup. You can imagine that there are many aspects that are still a little bit unknown.\"Final World Cup preparations underwayAs a global soccer convention of sorts comes to a close in Washington, D.C., the focus for World Cup-bound teams immediately shifts to scouting the teams they will face six months from now. In March, though, those national teams will reconvene for their final international break before the World Cup. Portugal and Belgium have booked trips to North America to face World Cup co-hosts U.S. and Mexico, the pair of friendlies offering an important trial run with next summer's tournament now fully in sight.Those friendlies were confirmed before Friday's draw and Saturday's schedule reveal, the visiting national teams among several who wanted to get a feel for things in North America before the tournament began. Portugal's March schedule was mostly constructed with a visit to Azteca Stadium to face Mexico in mind in case a trip to the venue would be required during the World Cup, something that is now unlikely. They will also face the U.S. men's national team in Atlanta, where they could play knockout matches depending on their run.\n\"I think playing in the Azteca, for us, was the main point,\" Martinez said. \"Playing at altitude is not something we can do playing in Europe. In Europe, playing at 1,500 meters is nowhere near the preparation you need for the Azteca so for us, the aspect of reliv[ing] the big moments in '86. We all grew up having many memories of those moments in the Azteca so for us from a psychological aspect, I think it makes total sense to live that in March rather than in the opening game of our World Cup story.\"Martinez previously visited Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the Super Bowl 2017 but as a spectator, though playing against the USMNT offers a chance to face a team from North America. While the final member of Group K will not be determined until March, that spot could be occupied by Jamaica should they get through a playoff that includes New Caledonia and DR Congo.\"To be honest, I haven't seen them,\" he said of the USMNT. \"We were focused on our preparation and qualifying for the World Cup but we're excited because I think playing USA is the only opportunity to play Concacaf teams so we're really looking forward. Obviously, Mauricio Pochettino is a very experienced coach and the technical staff, and they worked at the highest levels in Europe so we know them very, very well so it'll be only good things about their work and their preparation for the team so I think it's a great game for both national teams to prepare for the World Cup.\"\n            ",

UFC 323 wrapped up the last PPV event of 2025 before the coverage moves over to Paramount+ and two new champions will begin that era.One of them is a familiar face as Petr Yan took down Merab Dvalishvili and ended one of the longest winning streaks in the sport's history. Yan avenged his previous loss to the champion from 2023 and earned the title for a second time after previously holding it in 2022. Yan outclassed Dvalishvili over the five rounds despite the scorecards looking a bit closer in the end. Also in the new champion book is Joshua Van, who earned the flyweight title by way of a freak injury. Alexandre Pantoja suffered a nasty arm injury while landing on the mat in Round 1 of his title defense against Van and could no longer continue. The result meant that Van became the second-youngest UFC champion in history at just 24. He may already have a challenger in waiting as well with Tatsuro Taira earning a TKO of former titleholder Brandon Moreno earlier in the night.\nCBS Sports was with you throughout fight week with the latest news, in-depth features, and betting advice to consider.

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Joshua Van's crowning achievement brings more questions than answers. Van succeeded in dethroning Alexandre Pantoja to become the second youngest UFC champion ever, but the outcome of their fight at UFC 323 does little to address who the better man was. Early in Round 1, Pantoja threw a high kick. Van caught the kick and threw Pantoja to the mat. The defending champion immediately clutched his arm and called for referee Herb Dean. The official quickly stepped in and waved off the fight. A gruesome replay showed Pantoja's arm snapping at the elbow as he tried to plant on the mat. Van quickly consoled Pantoja as top contender Tatsuro Taira expressed shock cageside. Van raised his arms in victory as UFC announcer Bruce Buffer named him the new flyweight champion, and his coach paraded Van around on his shoulder. Such showboating might sour fans who deem the outcome inconclusive. Calling the injury a freak accident unfairly discredits Van. It was his offensive action that led to the finish. However, the armbreak was an unlikely outcome and a secondary effect of Van's attack, not something he intended to do. \nVan's name will go down in the record books regardless of the method of victory. At 24 years old, he became the second-youngest UFC champion in history, behind only Jon Jones, arguably MMA's all-time best fighter. Van's progress is remarkable. He didn't start competing professionally until after the COVID-19 pandemic and has already reached the mountaintop of the sport.Pantoja, 35, was building a great case for himself as the second-best flyweight of all-time, behind only Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. This loss does little to damage that. \nWhat's next depends on how fast Pantoja can heal. If his recovery timeline is short, the UFC might want to book an immediate rematch. Otherwise, Taira established himself as a worthy challenger after beating former two-time champion Brandon Moreno on Saturday. Van and Taira took virtually no damage at UFC 323 so, pending approval from the Nevada State Athletic Commission, they could turn around quickly. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS -- Payton Talbott and Henry Cejudo are the real deal. Talbott improved remarkably from his loss to Raoni Barcelos in January, taking down the Olympic gold medal wrestler twice at UFC 323 on Saturday in Las Vegas. Cejudo, outgunned and outsized, never relented in his final MMA fight, but still came up short on the scorecards to the young Talbott.Saturday's main card fighters delivered a thrilling scrap that won't soon be forgotten. Cejudo, bloodied and battered, fought through a crimson mask, refusing to retire quietly. Round 2 was particularly memorable, with Cejudo surviving an offensive onslaught by throwing back with a pitbull-like viciousness. \nThe size disparity between Talbott and Cejudo was apparent. Talbott, 11 years his opponent's junior, towered over the former two-division champion. He leveraged that reach and power to hurt Cejudo every round. Talbott pointed to the center, Max Holloway style, several times in Round 3. Cejudo accepted the invitation each time. \nTalbott's wrestling was arguably more impressive than his flashy striking. In January, Barcelos handed Talbott his first loss after eight takedowns. Fast forward to December, and Talbott not only fended off Cejudo's takedowns, but he also took down the Olympian twice. Cejudo retires for a second time after his previous retirement in 2023. The second leg of his career was fruitless, as Cejudo went 0-4. However, his legacy was solidified well before Saturday. Cejudo became a two-division UFC champion by beating a legend in Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson, and bantamweight greats T.J. Dillashaw and Dominick Cruz. In his final appearance, Cejudo refused to go down without a fight. \nThis victory is far and away the biggest of Talbott's career. Next week, he'll likely be ranked in the UFC's official bantamweight Top 10, usurping Cejudo's spot. Furthermore, he thoroughly beat a surefire Hall of Famer on a pay-per-view main card. The future looks bright for one of the promotion's most marketable young prospects.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final two UFC title defenses of 2025 are set to go down on Saturday at UFC 323 in Las Vegas. In the main event, bantamweight champion Merab Dvalishvili will look to pick up his fourth win of the year when he faces former champion Petr Yan in a rematch.If Dvalishvili can defeat Yan, he would set the record for the most consecutive bantamweight title defenses at four and become the first champion to defend a title four times in a calendar year. Yan is a dangerous opponent, with sharp boxing and strong takedown defense, but sits as a +330 underdog.A second title fight supports UFC 323. Alexandre Pantoja is building a strong case for being the second-best flyweight champion in UFC history, behind only Mount Rushmore fighter Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. His next challenger is compelling. Joshua Van burst onto the scene, going from UFC debutant to title challenger in two years. Like Dvalishvili, he fights for the fourth time this year in pursuit of becoming a UFC champion.Be sure to keep up with all the action on Saturday with our live coverage of UFC 323, including round-by-round scoring and updated fight results throughout the night!\nThere's plenty more to watch on this event in Vegas. A decorated combat athlete is set for his final walk to the Octagon when former two-division champion Henry Cejudo takes on rising prospect Payton Talbott. Cejudo told CBS Sports this week that he's ready for a new challenge after previously retiring from the sport in 2020. The 38-year-old also won Olympic gold in wrestling at the 2008 Beijing Games. Plus, former flyweight champion Brandon Moreno looks to hold on to his spot in the rankings when he takes on rising contender Tatsuro Taira. Moreno has lost twice as a pro to Pantoja, but could get back in the title picture if he and Van win on Saturday.\n        \n            \n                Merab Dvalishvili, UFC's ironman, isn't human, he's a 'Machine' as he attempts to make history\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith so much happening on Saturday night, let's look closer at the full fight card with the latest odds before we get to our staff predictions and picks for the PPV portion of the festivities that you can consider before hitting the sportsbooks.UFC 323 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookMerab Dvalishvili -425 (c) vs. Petr Yan +330, bantamweight titleAlexandre Pantoja -238 (c) vs. Joshua Van +195, flyweight titleTatsuro Taira -122 vs. Brandon Moreno +102, flyweightsPayton Talbott -278 vs. Henry Cejudo +225, bantamweightsJan Blachowicz -135 vs. Bogdan Guskov +114, light heavyweightsGrant Dawson -218 vs. Manuel Torres +180, lightweightsChris Duncan -166 vs. Terrance McKinney +140, lightweightsMaycee Barber -180 vs. Karine Silva +150, women's flyweightsFares Ziam -135 vs. Nazim Sadykhov +114, lightweightsMarvin Vettori -115 vs. Bruno Ferreira -105, middleweightsJalin Turner -298 vs. Edson Barboza +240, lightweightsIwo Baraniewski -192 vs. Ibo Aslan +160, light heavyweightsMansur Abdul-Malik -1150 vs. Antonio Trocoli +650, middleweightsMairon Santos -258 vs. Muhammad Naimov +210, featherweightsUFC 323 predictions, picksWith such a massive main event on tap, the crew at CBS Sports went ahead with predictions and picks for the main card from Brian Campbell, Brent Brookhouse, Shakiel Mahjouri, Michael Mormile and Brandon Wise.\n   CampbellBrookhouseMahjouriMormileWiseMerab (c) vs. YanMerabMerabMerabMerabYanPantoja (c) vs. VanPantojaPantojaPantojaPantojaPantojaTaira vs. MorenoMorenoMorenoMorenoMorenoTairaCejudo vs. TalbottTalbottTalbottCejudoCejudoTalbottBlachowicz vs. GuskovGuskovBlachowiczBlachowiczBlachowiczBlachowiczMerab Dvalishvili vs. Petr Yan predictionsCampbell: Death, taxes and Dvalishvili by decision. That has been the reality for the bantamweight division throughout most of the last seven years as Dvalishvili has run off 14 consecutive wins. While the well-rounded Yan was compromised in their first meeting in 2023 due to an injured hand, so was Dvalishvili, who has a history of persevering through physical setbacks. The recharged Yan might have the power and takedown defense to provide resistance (and this being Dvalishvili's fourth fight of 2025 needs to be acknowledged) but until another 135-pound fighter can prove he can go 25 minutes with Dvalishvili and not be overwhelmed by the volume of strikes and endless takedown attempts in order to drain their gas tank, it's not time to pick against the champion. Brookhouse: Dvalishvili is a pain to deal with; that much is obvious. But he's also so good at what he does that there's no real way to gameplan against him. Yan stuffed a ton of Dvalishvili takedowns in their first fight, but he still got blown out on the scorecards. Where the mystery lies is in whether Dvalishvili will be compromised by a fourth camp and weight cut in this calendar year. If Dvalishvili comes in as his normal self, it seems like it's going to take a home run shot from Yan that stops Dvalishvili immediately to get the victory. How has that worked for anyone recently against the champ?Mahjouri: Recency bias is a messy thing. Alex Pereira's revelation that he was compromised in his first fight against Magomed Ankalaev, and his subsequent return to form in the rematch, has led some to put too much stock in Petr Yan's injury claims. Yan recently claimed he fought Dvalishvili with an injured hand the first time. However, people forget that Dvalishvili also allegedly had a hand injury. The point is: fighters rarely compete at 100%. Injuries are worth factoring, but we must first and foremost observe the data. The data shows that Dvalishvili is the superior fighter. Dvalishvili overwhelmed Yan the first time, and he's only improving. A second win over Yan means that Dvalishvili will have defeated the top four bantamweight contenders in less than a year. By contrast, while Yan has certainly regained momentum on his three-fight win streak, none of the people he beat are on par with the three UFC champions -- Aljamain Sterling, Sean O'Malley, and Dvalishvili -- that he lost to. It's great to see Yan find his groove, but he's here mostly so that Dvalishvili can make history as the first champion to make four successful defenses in one year.\nWho wins UFC 323: Dvalishvili vs. Yan 2, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.Alexandre Pantoja vs. Joshua Van predictionsCampbell: At 24, Van represents an incredible story as he seeks to become the second-youngest champion in UFC history. But what Van doesn't yet know about facing an elite and experienced fighter such as the pound-for-pound ranked Pantoja is simply too much to overcome at such a young age. Look for Pantoja to mix the threat of the takedown with his technical striking to navigate some hairy two-way exchanges early before settling in and using Van's aggressiveness against him. A late-round submission isn't out of the question for the accomplished flyweight king as he defends his title for the fifth time. Brookhouse: Van is probably a future champion. Pantoja doesn't seem like the kind of champion Van is ready to beat yet in this moment. Pantoja is just so crafty, so slick and so dominant that Van has never faced anything like him before. Van is also fighting for a fourth time this year, so the same questions that applied to Dvalishvili apply to him. Van hasn't shown a proven ability to finish fights at this level, while Pantoja is an absolute monster the second he senses an opponent is on the ropes, or has made a mistake that leaves them open. If Van can win a round or two and make it to the scorecards, it would be a huge win for the 24-year-old, but I fear we're stuck looking for moral victories for Van and little more.\nMahjouri: Saturday's co-main event has many thrilling contrasts: experience vs. youth, grappling vs. striking, and underappreciated excellence vs. the hot new thing. Pantoja is a beast who's quietly put together a flyweight resume second only to Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson. He has the most overall wins, finishes, and submissions, and the second-most title fight wins in flyweight history. The champ pairs an in-your-face brawling style with great wrestling and even better back control. His rear-naked choke is particularly deadly, and he's never been finished in 35 professional fights. If there's someone who can crack that legendary chin, especially with Pantoja at 35, it's the challenger. Van is arguably the best pure striker in the division who's roared to title contention with five wins in under 12 months. His takedown defense could use work, but he's terrific at getting to his feet quickly. This fight comes down to whose strong defensive game crumbles first: Pantoja's chin or Van's ability to get off the mat. Pantoja's pace is another important factor, considering Van has never fought for more than 15 minutes. There's a strong case to be made for either fighter, but Pantoja's pace and experience should get him a decision win or late submission.Brandon Moreno vs. Tatsuro Taira predictionsCampbell: In a fight which could go a long way in producing the next 125-pound title challenger, don't count out how much the 31-year-old Moreno, a former two-time flyweight champion, still has left in the tank. Over his last six fights, Moreno's only defeats have come by disputed split decision and he rebounded nicely to produce back-to-back wins over Amir Albazi and Steve Erceg. The 25-year-old Taira is exciting but still far too reckless for the boxing of Moreno, who has leaned into a more technical approach in recent years and should have enough to keep himself firmly entrenched in the title picture.Brookhouse: Moreno may have had a small skid in losing split decisions to Alexandre Pantoja and Brandon Royval back-to-back, but the two wins that followed proved Moreno is still a handful for anyone in the flyweight division. Taira is a fun and exciting fighter and has the pop in his strikes, so this is not an easy fight for Moreno, but I do believe that proven high-level experience is always a factor to take into consideration. Moreno is 31, which isn't young in the lightest division, but he's not showing signs of his best days being behind him. The way Moreno can navigate tricky situations against even the best fighters in the world is a special trait. Taira might be able to explode his way to a victory, but I'm riding with the proven veteran in this one.\nMahjouri: Moreno is about to make himself an undeniable contender after consecutive split decision losses to Pantoja and Brandon Royval. The former two-time flyweight champ has done this by turning away each rising young star put in front of him. Taira is another in that new wave of flyweights trying to replace the old guard. Moreno is so well-rounded, blending elusive striking with a dogged wrestling game. Taira is very offensively oriented, leaving major gaps in his striking and takedown defense. Moreno, who has never been stopped in 33 pro fights, should feast on that for 15 minutes. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The two boxers best known for giving lightweight champion Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis his toughest pro tests to date will square off against one another on Saturday as Mexican star Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz and Lamont Roach Jr. meet in a pay-per-view clash in San Antonio.   The interim WBC junior welterweight title bout will serve as the headline bout of a Premier Boxing Champions card (Prime Video PPV, 8 p.m. ET) from the Frost Bank Center. In the co-main event, Stephen Fulton Jr. looks for a title in a third division when he faces WBC junior lightweight champion O'Shaquie Foster.Cruz (28-3-1, 18 KOs), the diminutive slugger from Mexico City, fought Davis on short notice in 2021 and largely built his professional reputation upon the strong performance he gave in a close decision loss. Roach (25-1-2, 10 KOs), an amateur rival of Davis from Maryland who still holds the WBA 130-pound title, fought \"Tank\" on even terms in a March lightweight bout but was forced to settle for a disputed majority draw. Davis (30-0-1, 28 KOs) initially activated his immediate rematch clause with Roach until pulling out and instead signing for a November clash with YouTube star Jake Paul. That fight was canceled after Davis, who has a decorated history of legal issues, was named in a civil lawsuit by an ex-girlfriend accusing him of domestic violence. \nCruz, 27, a former 140-pound titleholder, will be headlining his first PPV card and is expected to have the Texas crowd very much on his side. But the 30-year-old Roach, who will be moving up in weight for the second straight fight, is no stranger to playing spoiler and enters as the betting favorite for a fight in which both headliners have the opportunity to truly announce themselves as independent stars.Where to watch Cruz vs. RoachDate: Saturday, Dec. 6 | Location: Frost Bank Center -- San Antonio, TexasStart time: 8 p.m. ETStreaming: Prime Video PPV | Price: $74.99 \"I could have never imagined five years ago when I was fighting in San Antonio that I'd be here now, but this is the fruits of my hard work,\" Cruz said at Thursday's final press conference. \"I want to keep progressing and evolving and doing big things. I know what my fans expect of me, and I've done everything I could in training camp to deliver.\"I hope [Roach] doesn't run. It's all about the fans and they want to see us go toe-to-toe. I'll be ready to go for as long as he's able to withstand the pressure.\"\nMany in boxing believe Roach was robbed out of a second title in as many divisions against Davis, not just by the divisive scorecards but due to a voluntary knee \"Tank\" took in Round 9 that was incorrectly not ruled a knockdown by referee Steve Willis and would've resulted in a Roach upset win. Yet, Roach never harped one bit on the controversy, even during the immediate post-fight interview, and has kept an even keel about the experience that fuels him entering the Cruz fight. \"It gets to a point where I'm very accepting. I had been through things in life that were similar or worse,\" Roach told CBS Sports on Tuesday, looking back at the Davis fight. \"It's alright. I know that me doing what I have to do, me continuing on the path that I'm on, everything is going to be OK. I can't dwell on the past, it just don't work like that. It's not going to change anything. The only way you get better is to learn and move on. \"I consider that a bump and bruise on my path. It brought a little light and that's all I needed. Now we are advancing and getting bigger and getting better.\"\nRoach said a victory over Cruz could lift him to any number of marquee fights across the 135 and 140-pound divisions. Cruz, meanwhile, believes the winner of Saturday's fight should draw the winner of the Jan. 31 bout between WBO junior welterweight titleholder Teofimo Lopez Jr. and three-division champion Shakur Stevenson. Either way, the stakes are high in a fight that is expected to be contested at a high pace, featuring a mixture of technical boxing and two-way skirmishes. Below is the complete PPV fight card for Saturday night in San Antonio with the latest odds.\nCruz vs. Roach fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookLamont Roach Jr. -235 vs. Isaac Cruz (c) +180, interim WBC junior welterweight titleStephen Fulton -115 vs. O'Shaquie Foster (c) -110, WBC junior lightweight titleErislandy Lara (c) -700 vs. Johan Gonzalez +450, WBC middleweight titleJesus Ramos -1400 vs. Shane Mosley Jr. +700, junior middleweights\n            ",

The fight was announced on Saturday during the UFC 323 PPV broadcast.Hernandez built a cult following by fighting all comers, no matter who the promotion put in front of him. A Fight Night main event against Reinier de Ridder was his chance to earn a middleweight title shot; however, an injury forced him off the card. Brendan Allen, who Hernandez beat in February, upset De Ridder in October, clearing an obstacle from Hernandez's path. Strickland returns to action for the first time since his second title loss to former champion Dricus du Plessis. Currently ranked No. 3 in the UFC's official 185-pound rankings, a win is imperative if he wants to fight reigning champ Khamzat Chimaev. \nThe winner of this five-round main event must also contend with Nassourdine Imavov, who's currently ranked No. 2 and on a five-fight winning streak. Herandez has won eight consecutive exciting fights; meanwhile, Strickland holds a 2023 victory over Imavov.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday was almost more notable for what didn't happen than the chaos on the pitch. Benched for the third consecutive match, club legend Mohamed Salah went as an unused sub for the second time in the last three matches. Salah has now failed to register a goal contribution in seven consecutive matches in all competitions, and he only has five goals and three assists all season, while Liverpool have slipped, not just out of the title race, but out of the European places altogether.It's been a trying season for the Reds, and following the draw, Salah has opened the door to whether this could be the end of his time at Liverpool. While Salah has been a critical part of Liverpool's attack, scoring 29 goals and assisting 18 more en route to winning the title last season, being on the bench these past few games is getting to him, and the Egyptian sounded off following the loss to Leeds.\"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,\" Salah said. While Salah didn't specify who is trying to get him out of the club, he did admit that his relationship with manager Arne Slot has deteriorated this season. \n\"I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship,\" Salah said. \"I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.\"Salah leaves for the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Egypt on Dec. 15, and if they advance to the final, he wouldn't return to Liverpool until after Jan. 18 of 2026, when the winter transfer window will be open. Despite just signing a contract extension with Liverpool at the end of last season, this could be the end of Salah at Anfield. He still has two games before AFCON, an away trip to Inter in the Champions League on Tuesday, followed by a home clash with Brighton on Dec. 13Comments like the ones made Saturday are tough ones to come back from, and they didn't end there for Salah. \n\"I said to [my family], come to the Brighton game. I don't know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it. In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now,\" Salah said. \"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup. I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.\"With previous interest from the Saudi Pro League, if Liverpool were to decide that it's time to move on, they could likely find a suitor to take the Egyptian. Even at 33, Salah has more to give, but Father Time is catching up to him in the Premier League, so a January move could benefit all parties.\"In football, you never know. I don't accept this situation. I have done so much for this club,\" Salah said when asked if this would be his last game for the club.\nIt seems like Salah is willing to fight for his place at Liverpool, but it has created quite a situation for Slot and the club. Playing Salah after this almost makes it seem like Slot is caving to him, but then not selecting Salah would deepen the spiral that is happening. When Slot took over for Jurgen Klopp ahead of last season, he was expected to face adversity, but with the Reds riding a smooth journey to the title, he avoided the worst of it.That all seems to be coming to a head this season, as with Liverpool not winning, cracks in the foundation of the club are there as they struggle to integrate Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak. Previously, this was Salah's team, and with the additions and decisions made, it has morphed into Slot's team. That'd be one thing if Liverpool were keeping pace with the title contenders, but if it comes down to Salah versus Slot in a power struggle, it's unclear what direction the front office would lean. Liverpool have rarely been a team to dismiss a manager in the middle of a season, especially when someone has built up as much goodwill as Slot did in his first year in charge, but something also will need to give here between the duo if the situation is fixed. If it doesn't get fixed, Liverpool's issues from this season will grow and they could find themselves looking at quite a long rebuild down the road.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sepp Straka is the solo leader heading into the final round at the 2025 Hero World Challenge after firing a third-round 64, going shot-for-shot with two-time defending Scottie Scheffler in the third round to take the solo lead at 17 under with 18 holes remaining.Straka kept his card bogey-free on Saturday, playing steady golf all day and taking advantage of opportunities when they presented themselves with four birdies and two eagles -- chipping in on the par-5 6th and rolling one in on the par-5 15th -- to climb to the top leaderboard at Albany Golf Club.\nIt was the kind of performance that made Straka one of the most consistent players on the PGA Tour last season. He'll look to keep that going heading into Sunday. \"Yeah, I played pretty nice. Front nine, I felt like I didn't really make any putts early on, but then the putter started feeling pretty nice around the turn,\" Straka said. \"Yeah, honestly, similar to yesterday. Iron play was really good; I just struggled with the driver a little bit. Hopefully clean that up for tomorrow.\"\nThe driver wasn't that loose as he found every fairway, but he was spot on in his assessment of his iron play, as he led the field hitting 16 of 18 greens in regulation during the third round. That combination meant he dealt with little in the way of stress as he made his way around Albany GC. While he didn't produce the spectacular shot as often as his playing partner, it was the rare round where Scheffler wasn't the player in a pairing making the fewest mistakes. Straka will now take a one-shot lead into Sunday as he looks to cap off a career year on Tour with a third win after already claiming titles at the American Express and Truist. To do so, he'll have to beat Scheffler head-to-head on back-to-back days.Scheffler eyeing 3-peatThe world No. 1 had himself a terrific round Saturday, too, getting off to what he called a \"dream start\" with four birdies and an eagle across his first seven holes. He finished the day with eight birdies and an eagle, but he stumbled down the stretch with a pair of bogeys in his final three holes to shoot 65 and post 16 under, one stroke behind Straka. \nIt was a ball-striking exhibition from Scheffler for the first 15 holes, and it looked for a moment like he might run away and hide as he held a two-shot lead on the 15th tee. However, Scheffler walked off the 18th green extremely frustrated after a pair of bogeys, including a rare miss to the short side from the fairway at the last that he couldn't get up and down from. Scheffler rifled his ball into the water after cleaning up for bogey and had some choice words for himself, but he is still in prime position to win Tiger Woods' event for a third straight year. Scheffler has been dialled in tee-to-green as per usual, but with a new driver in the bag this week, his performance on a course that can present some stress off the tee has been impressive. He seems to have quickly established trust with that club, finding the fairway on every hole. With his iron play and solid putting performance, he knows what he has to do on Sunday to pick up another trophy from Tiger. \"Just continue to execute,\" Scheffler said. \"Like I said, did a lot of good stuff today and more of that tomorrow, I think I'll be in a good spot.\"\nWho else is in the hunt?Alex Noren (-14)Hideki Matsuyama (-14)Wyndham Clark (-13)J.J. Spaun (-13)Straka and Scheffler will have a bit of a cushion going into Sunday, as the chase pack behind them starts at 14 under. While they tore up Albany GC on Saturday for the two low rounds of the week, the rest of the leaders couldn't match their pace, and as a resul,t they will now need a special round on Sunday to threaten the final pairing. Noren and Matsuyama will go out together in the penultimate group at 14 under, three behind Straka. They will have to shoot a 66 or so to play catch-up, given the worst round we've seen from Straka and Scheffler this week is a 69. Two U.S. Open champions will go off ahead of them at 13 under in the Spaun-Clark pairing, where one of those two will need to produce their lowest round of the week to threaten the leaders. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With less than 24 hours remaining until the 12-team College Football Playoff bracket is revealed, oddsmakers have it clear who may be receiving the final at-large spots. Notre Dame (-1050) is heavily favored to reach the CFP via an at-large bid, while Alabama (-320) and Miami (+164) are right behind.Texas is also being offered long-shot odds (+2500) to reach the CFP, but the Longhorns will more than likely be on the outside looking in on Sunday afternoon. Those odds are current at FanDuel Sportsbook as of 9:50 p.m. ET on Saturday.Entering the weekend, up to two at-large spots were likely up for grabs. With most teams idle during conference championship week, only a few had one final opportunity to present their respective case to the committee. BYU entered the weekend likely needing to beat Texas Tech in the Big 12 title game to secure an automatic bid to the CFP. \n        \n            \n                It's fair to question Alabama's College Football Playoff legitimacy after lopsided SEC Championship Game loss\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, the Cougars fell 34-7 to the Red Raiders, making their case to receive an at-large bid a complicated one. The Cougars' lone two losses this season have both come against Texas Tech.\nIn the penultimate CFP rankings released earlier this week, Alabama jumped to No. 9 -- ahead of Notre Dame, BYU and Miami. One of the biggest talking points throughout the last several weeks was Miami's 27-24 win over Notre Dame in Week 1. However, Notre Dame has stayed ahead of Miami in the CFP rankings and has won 10 consecutive games.The contenders vying for an at-large bid to the CFPMiami (10-2) began the season 5-0 before suffering its first loss at home to Louisville. Two weeks later, the Hurricanes lost to SMU 26-20 in overtime, which dropped Miami to 6-2 overall and 2-2 in ACC play. Despite winning their last four games, Miami was left out of the ACC title game due to tiebreakers.Notre Dame (10-2) began the season with losses to Miami and Texas A&M before finishing the regular season with a 10-game win streak. The Fighting Irish own wins over Mountain West champion Boise State, USC and Pitt. Notre Dame is seeking its second consecutive CFP appearance after reaching the semifinals last season.\nAlabama (10-3) could become the first team in the CFP era to receive an at-large bid with three losses on its résume after losing to Georgia 28-7 in the SEC title game. Last season, Clemson reached the CFP by winning the ACC title despite having three losses on its résumé. Alabama is seeking its first CFP appearance in the post-Nick Saban era.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Anytime touchdown bets have become very popular these days. Who's scoring today? That's what everyone wants to know, and I'm here to offer some insight for your parlays.Last week, I predicted Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Brenton Strange would score his first touchdown of the season at +340, and also got Denver Broncos wideout Courtland Sutton at +170.

These will not be predictable choices like a Derrick Henry or Jonathan Taylor score, but they won't be wild long-shots such as a team defense. Let's begin with a wide receiver who is getting his quarterback back. Odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 bet:1. WR Terry McLaurin, Washington Commanders (+200)\nJayden Daniels is back in the lineup for this Week 14 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, which is a good thing for Terry McLaurin. Washington's WR1 has finally arrived, as he had his best performance of the season in the overtime loss to the Broncos last week, catching 7 of 14 targets from Marcus Mariota for 96 yards and a touchdown. McLaurin isn't just a big-play threat, but a weapon targeted in the red zone as well. Last season, he set a franchise record with 13 touchdown receptions. \n2. TE Mark Andrews, Baltimore Ravens (+170)\nLamar Jackson hasn't registered a touchdown in three straight starts for the first time in his career, but that's going to change this Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ravens tight end Mark Andrews signed a three-year, $39.3 million extension this past week that reportedly includes $26 million guaranteed, which shows you how much the franchise values him. I'll take Andrews to find pay dirt on Sunday.3. TE Darren Waller. Miami Dolphins (+240)\nHere's an interesting flier. Remember when Darren Waller made his Dolphins debut in Week 4 and caught two touchdowns? Then caught touchdowns in each of the next two games as well? Waller made his return to the lineup last week against the New Orleans Saints after a stint on injured reserve, and caught two passes for 47 yards. This week, he will score vs. the New York Jets. 4. RB D'Andre Swift, Chicago Bears (+190)\nThe Bears' running backs were a major reason why Chicago upset the Philadelphia Eagles last week, as Kyle Monangai and D'Andre Swift became the first teammates in franchise history to rush for 125 yards and a touchdown in the same game. Monangai rushed 22 times for 130 yards and a score, while Swift rushed 18 times for 125 yards and a touchdown against his former team. Monangai is dealing with an ankle injury, but will play. So give me Swift to score in this important NFC North showdown. \n5. RB Kyren Williams, Los Angeles Rams (-105)\nThe Rams are looking to avenge their shocking upset loss to the Carolina Panthers this week, and get a rival that was just eliminated from playoff contention in the Arizona Cardinals. I think points are coming. Kyren Williams has scored touchdowns in eight of 12 games played this season, so he's a good pick for your parlay. This line was plus money on Friday. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff Selection Committee will not have it easy this weekend trying to decide the final at-large spots coming out of various conference championship game results. Ninth-ranked Alabama's one-sided loss to No. 3 Georgia is an intriguing -- and unexpected -- additional data point for the committee, who could critically dock the SEC's runner-up in favor of Miami for the 12-team bracket's final at-large spot.However, the committee would have to devalue the SEC Championship Game for the first time in playoff history for the Crimson Tide to be left out entirely in favor of the No. 9 and 10 spots going to Notre Dame and the Hurricanes. No team in playoff history has reached the postseason as a three-loss, at-large nominee, nor has an at-large team lost multiple games by 10 or more points during the season. Alabama is trying to become the first on both accounts.Now, there is precedent for a committee dropping a team that was idle for no reason. In 2014, TCU dropped from No. 3 to No. 6 in the final rankings after beating Iowa State 55-3 when the Big 12 did not hold a conference championship game that season. Florida State and Ohio State made the first four-team playoff that year instead as the Nos. 3 and 4 seeds after winning the ACC and Big Ten title games.The ACC's doomsday scenario is in play following Duke's win over Virginia, which leaves the 12 seed up in the air between James Madison and the Blue Devils. Considering JMU was slotted 25th earlier this week and we don't know where the committee power-rated Duke, that's a bad situation unfolding for the ACC, which could be left out entirely. \nIndiana is college football's lone unbeaten entering the postseason after knocking off defending national champion Ohio State in the Big Ten showdown. And the Hoosiers have earned top billing by taking out the previously top-ranked Buckeyes on Saturday night in Indianapolis.Here's a glance at how we see the final 12-team CFP bracket unfolding Sunday coming out of championship weekend:College Football Playoff Quarterfinals DateGame / LocationProjectionJan. 1 Rose BowlPasadena, Calif.(1) Indiana vs. (8/9) WinnerJan. 1 Cotton BowlArlington, Texas(2) Ohio State vs. (7/10) WinnerJan. 1 Sugar BowlNew Orleans(3) Georgia vs. (6/11) WinnerDec. 31 Orange BowlMiami, Fla.(4) Texas Tech vs. (5/12) WinnerFirst roundDate LocationProjectionWinner facesDec. 19 or 20Oklahoma Memorial StadiumNorman, Oklahoma(9) Notre Dame at (8) Oklahoma (1) IndianaDec. 19 or 20Kyle FieldCollege Station, Texas(10) Alabama at (7) Texas A&M(2) Ohio StateDec. 19 or 20Vaught-Hemingway StadiumOxford, Mississippi(11) Tulane at (6) Ole Miss(3) GeorgiaDec. 19 or 20Autzen StadiumEugene, Oregon(12) James Madison at (5) Oregon(4) Texas TechDon't see your team? Check out Brad Crawford's complete bowl projections.Projected College Football Playoff Field breakdown1. Indiana: What a finish from the Hoosiers. The committee will move Indiana to No. 1 in the rankings following its win over Ohio State. Indiana has there wins this season over ranked competition, but this was the best of the year against the unbeaten defending national champions.2. Ohio State: After getting through the gauntlet of last season's playoff as a low-seed, the Buckeyes are going to be one of the teams to beat this time around after nearly getting through the regular season and the Big Ten Championship Game unscathed. Losing to Indiana hurts, but the Buckeyes have been here before and now start their trek toward another title. 3. Georgia: The Bulldogs should move into the No. 3 slot as the SEC champions, especially after their beatdown of Alabama on the grand stage in Atlanta to avenge their only loss of the season against the Crimson Tide. It was a vintage performance defensively after Georgia limited the Crimson Tide to negative yardage on the ground with Alabama's lone score coming in the fourth quarter. No team in the country outside of Ohio State played better down the stretch against stiff competition than the Bulldogs.4. Texas Tech: The first 12-win season in school history and a conference championship won. That's a key element in the Red Raiders potentially moving ahead of Big Ten runner-up Ohio State in Sunday's final rankings. The Red Raiders dominated the Big 12 Championship Game, torching the league's second-best team -- BYU -- for a second time this season. The committee has a decision to make for the Nos. 2, 3 and 4 spots.5. Oregon: The Ducks saved their best execution for late in the season, running off six straight wins -- including a pair over ranked teams since the loss to Indiana -- to secure a first-round home game. Oregon's hoping to get wideouts Gary Bryant Jr. and Dakorien Moore back for the opening round and is trying to win its first playoff game under Lanning after falling to Ohio State in last year's quarterfinals at the Rose Bowl.6. Ole Miss: Not only did losing Lane Kiffin not affect the Rebels' standing, but the committee boosted Ole Miss last week after routing Mississippi State on the road to finish 11-1. The promotion of Pete Golding to head coach coupled with Charlie Weis Jr. returning to Oxford to call plays for a postseason run strengthened the committee's opinion of Ole Miss, though we didn't hear that publicly. Trinidad Chambliss and the Rebels will get a first-round home game with a chance to move on to the quarterfinals as a betting favorite.7. Texas A&M: After sliding behind Ole Miss last week, the Aggies will be at home in the first round as a one-loss SEC selection from the at-large group. Texas A&M squandered an opening-round bye opportunity in the finale at Texas, but a victory at Notre Dame this season was one of the nation's best, and they tip-toed around several SEC opponents down the stretch to finish off one of the best regular seasons in program history.8. Oklahoma: The committee never wavered on the Sooners despite this offense struggling to produce over its final four games of the season. Oklahoma's win at Alabama stamped its playoff trip in the first of three elimination games the Sooners won in November to get to the first round. This defense is as stout as any in the field, but it looks like Oklahoma will have to win ugly to keep it going as a title threat.9. Notre Dame: The most debated final two at-large spots in playoff history is unfolding between three bluebloods, and if the committee follows the same path they've taken the last five weeks, the Fighting Irish and Crimson Tide will be the choices at Nos. 9 and 10 over Miami. Notre Dame had a resume-booster while the Fighting Irish and Hurricanes were idle during championship weekend as well following Boise State's win in the Mountain West Championship Game. Notre Dame beat the Broncos earlier this season, 28-7.10. Alabama: The Crimson Tide should be very thankful the committee moved them to No. 9 last week ahead of the SEC Championship Game with Georgia. It acted as a built-in buffer, essentially. Following Saturday's lackluster play against the Bulldogs, Alabama would be out in favor of Miami had Kalen DeBoer's squad still been in the No. 10 spot coming into championship weekend. Now, the committee can simply move Alabama back one spot and avoid the Notre Dame-Miami dilemma altogether. That's where we're projecting Alabama to be in the final rankings, just ahead of the Hurricanes for the final at-large spot. Also, by seeding Notre Dame and Alabama at Nos. 9 and 10, the committee avoids regular-season rematches in the opening round of the playoff.11. Tulane: The highest-ranked Group of Five team entering conference championship weekend, the Green Wave ran away from North Texas in the first half and never looked back to win the American under outgoing coach Jon Sumrall. Tulane will be on the road in the first round, likely facing Oregon at Autzen Stadium as a double-digit underdog.12. James Madison: Unless the committee was convinced by five-loss Duke that the Blue Devils are worth a spot in the playoff, then JMU is going to get the final auto-bid designation by being ranked higher in the final top 25. The Dukes didn't pass the eye test in the Sun Belt final against Troy, but it was their 12th win -- and that's four more than Duke this season. Plus, JMU was ranked 25th in Tuesday's penultimate rankings.Bowl intel beyond the playoff bracketThe Notre Dame-Miami debate for the committee has significant implications for a few of the highest-tier bowl games outside of the playoff. The Fighting Irish are eligible for any of the ACC's bowl slots, which includes the Pop-Tarts Bowl and Gator Bowl. One bowl source told CBS Sports this week BYU is expected to be chosen to fill the Big 12's tie-in for the Pop-Tarts Bowl against one of the ACC's highest finishers. Based on our final playoff projection, that's either Miami, Duke or Virginia.Miami played in the Pop-Tarts Bowl last bowl season, so the Hurricanes would also be a welcomed option for the Gator Bowl against a 10-win Vanderbilt team if not selected for the playoff. Tennessee is also being considered for the game in Jacksonville on Dec. 27, a source told CBS Sports on Saturday. If the Vols play in the Gator, Vanderbilt would likely play in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa against Iowa, per team sources.One of the postseason's top games outside of the playoff, the Citrus Bowl gets first selection of SEC and Big Ten teams once the 12-team bracket is set and the highest-ranked remaining teams in each league are often selected. We expect Texas (9-3) be the choice in Orlando from the SEC side — unless Alabama is left out of the playoff bracket — and Michigan as the Big Ten's representative. The Wolverines (9-3) last played in the Citrus to end the 2019 season while the Longhorns would be a first-time participant.After the Citrus Bowl selects a team, there will be a pool of six bowls and the conference -- in consultation with the institutions and the bowls -- will make the assignments for this group from all eligible remaining SEC teams. With the SEC being unable to fill its bowl allotment this season after six teams finished with five or fewer wins, one of the league's tie-ins this month will not get a conference team. We're expecting that to be the Mayo Bowl in Charlotte.Kansas State (6-6) declined a bowl opportunity and sources tell CBS Sports that Rice (5-7) is being considered for that final spot based on its high Academic Progress Rate (APR) ranking. Auburn (5-7) would be next in line, but would likely decline to focus on recruiting and its new staff under Alex Golesh. The Owls have made it clear they would be interested in playing another game this season.Also in the Big Ten, there was multiple game wanting Penn State (6-6), but a source confirmed Saturday the Nittany Lions are heading to Yankee Stadum to play an ACC opponent in the Pinstripe Bowl. In other yet-to-be-announced Big Ten designations, we expect Nebraska to play in the Las Vegas Bowl, Iowa in the ReliaQuest Bowl and Illinois in the Music City Bowl, among others.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Word Cup is approaching next summer and most of the biggest soccer stars will arrive in the United States, Canada and Mexico to represent their national teams at the best tournament in the world that takes place every four years. The 2026 World Cup will likely also be the last one of some of the most influential athletes of the past decades such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric, among others. With the draw now complete, let's go around the world and take a closer look at the best players that we will see playing at the World Cup in the summer 2026. Lionel Messi, ArgentinaThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner and 2022 World Cup champion with Argentina is expected to play his last-ever major international soccer tournament with his beloved national team. Messi is considered one of the best players in the history of the game and after spending the majority of his club career at Barcelona, he moved to PSG in the summer of 2021 before signing for Inter Miami in 2023. In October, he signed a new deal with the MLS side until 2028. Over his extraordinary career, he won won 10 LaLiga titles, seven Copa del Rey, eight Spanish Supercups, four Champions Leagues, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups with Barcelona. Two Ligue 1 titles and one Trophée des Champions with won PSG before lifting the Leagues Cup with Inter Miami. On Saturday, he also guided Inter Miami to MLS Cup glory, recording two assists in the final, a 3-1 win over the Vancouver Whitecaps.Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal The international dualism between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will see the final showdown at the 2026 World Cup as the Portuguese star will also likely play his last ever tournament with the national team. Ronaldo, one of the greatest in the sport, played with Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus and moved to Al-Nassr in 2023, becoming the first world star who signed with a Saudi team, he started a new era for the Saudi Arabian league as many others followed in recent years. Among five Champions League trophies (one with Manchester United and four with Real Madrid) and many others with his clubs, Ronaldo also won the 2016 Euro with Portugal, and also five Ballon d'Ors over his outstanding career. Christian Pulisic, USAThe USMNT captain will lead the team coached by Mauricio Pochettino at the 2026 World Cup and he's expected to be one of the biggest stars playing at the summer tournament. Pulisic, who moved to AC Milan in the summer 2023 from Chelsea, also played for Borussia Dortmund from 2015 to 2019 before making his Premier League move. The 27-year old has been one of the best Serie A players over the last two years and he proved he made the right choice back in 2023. The 2026 World Cup on home soil could become a defining milestone in his career.\nLamine Yamal, Spain This is going to be the World Cup of Lamine Yamal. At least, this is the expectation. After dominating the scene at the 2024 Euro with Spain, and winning twice the Kopa Trophy as the best young player in the world, Lamine Yamal will lead Spain at the summer tournament as La Roja will try to win their second ever World Cup after the 2010 edition in South Africa.Kylian Mbappe, FranceThe French superstar has been one of the best players in the last two World Cups he played with France. After winning the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Mbappe scored a hat trick in the unforgettable final played against Argentina in 2022, becoming the second-ever player to score three goals in a World Cup final after Geoff Hurst in 1966 for England. Sadly, that wasn't enough for him to lead his team to become the first nation to win the cup back to back since Brazil in 1958 and 1962. The Real Madrid striker will try again in the summer 2026, which will also be the last one under French manager and 2018 World Cup winner Didier Deschamps who has already announced he will leave the team after the summer tournament. Son Heung-min, South KoreaThe South Korean star who signed for LA FC in the summer 2025 is set to play his last ever World Cup with South Korea, marking the end of an era for who is considered the best ever player in the history of his country. After playing for a decade in the Premier League with Tottenham, Son ended his European club career by winning the 2024-25 edition of the UEFA Europa League with Spurs in the final against Manchester United. Son has now made 139 appearances for South Korea, setting a new national record as the most capped player in the country's history. \nMohamed Salah, EgyptThe Liverpool striker will play his second ever World Cup after the 2018 edition when Egypt were eliminated in the group stage after losing all the three games played against Uruguay, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Salah's potential last World Cup with Egypt will be a key moment for his career with the national team, after winning twice the African Player of the Year award in 2017 and 2018 becoming one of the most iconic players in the world especially after he joined Liverpool in 2017 from AS Roma. Jude Bellingham, EnglandThe Real Madrid midfielder will feature in his second World Cup after playing with England at the 2022 edition when the team coached by Gareth Southgate were eliminated by France in the quarterfinals. Bellingham, who joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2023 from Borussia Dortmund, immediately became one of the key players under the management of both Carlo Ancelotti and now Xabi Alonso He's widely seen as a future Ballon d'Or contender, and lifting the World Cup with the Three Lions in summer 2026 would certainly accelerate it.Luka Modric, CroatiaThe 40-year old and 2018 Ballon d'Or winner will play his last ever World Cup with Croatia after an incredibly successful career. Modric led his national team to the 2018 final, only to lose to France, and after winning 19 major trophies with Real Madrid, including five UEFA Champions League titles, the Croatian legend left the Spanish giants in the summer of 2025 and joined AC Milan.\nErling Haaland, Norway The 2026 World Cup will be the first one for Manchester City star Erling Haaland with Norway, as the former Borussia Dortmund striker will feature on the Norwegian roster. It will be the fourth ever appearance of Norway at the World Cup, the first one since 1998, when they reached the round of 16 of the tournament played in France. Haaland, who has already scored 55 goals in 48 appearances for his national team, is set to make a historic World Cup debut next summer.Vinicius Jr, Brazil Brazil will be one of those teams to watch this summer as the five time world champions appointed Italian legendary manager Carlo Ancelotti to lead the team after some disappointments but a lot will also depend on the form of the players starting from Real Madrid star Vinicius Jr. The Brazilian winger is called to make the difference also with his national team after winning 14 major trophies with Real Madrid, including three LaLiga titles, two UEFA Champions League titles, three Spanish Super Cups, two UEFA Super Cups, three FIFA Club World Cups, and one Copa del Rey. In October 2024, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or voting behind Manchester City midfielder Rodri, sparking widespread debate especially after he chose not to attend the ceremony in Paris, a decision backed by Real Madrid and club president Florentino Perez. Ousmane Dembele, FranceLast but not least, the 2025 Ballon d'Or winner. After claiming the Treble with PSG in the 2024–25 season, Dembele's start to the new campaign was affected by injuries, but he is expected to respond ahead of the World Cup where, alongside stars like Kylian Mbappe, he will try to secure France's second World Cup in less than a decade. \n            ",

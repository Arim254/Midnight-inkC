    "body": "\n        College basketball's version of free agency is a mad dash of Zoom meetings, backup plans to the backup plan, last-second flights and a boatload of haggling. Last spring was a zoo with an overinflated market due to schools' ability to double-dip into revenue share dollars and NIL donation coffers. Agents knew it. Players knew it and the bidding wars commenced.   Once a commitment is made, Twitter explodes with a flurry of \"great get\" responses, and the show goes on.  The fascinating fallout arrives when two teams target the same position. No. 18 Florida and No. 5 UConn, the last two title-winners who tangle Tuesday at Madison Square Garden, are good examples of this. The Gators and the Huskies both hit the free agency market knowing they needed to make a big splash at guard. Florida landed the coveted duo of Boogie Fland and Xaivian Lee. UConn landed the prized pair of Silas Demary Jr. and Malachi Smith.   So how's it going? Winning a championship strictly through the portal feels almost impossible in this era, but this 2025 batch of transfers is shaping up to be the most talented group since the portal's inception in 2018. Let's dive into early vibe checks from each of the top-30 players from last spring's portal cycle.  \n\n    \n                                        \n      1. F Yaxel Lendeborg  Transferred from: UAB | To: Michigan  The numbers: 15.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 40% from 3-point range  The scoop: Dusty May has tweaked Lendeborg's role from the fulcrum of an offense to an advantage-smashing, stampede menace. Lendeborg attempted over 2.3 midrange jumpers per game last year. He's totaled just three midrange Js in eight games at Michigan. He's taking and making more 3-pointers, shooting an absurd 87% on 2-pointers and settling in nicely into Michigan's No. 1 defense.  Plenty expected Lendeborg to become the Danny Wolf replacement, but his job description (hunting 3-pointers, smoking teams in transition, attacking bent defenses and switching everything defensively on the perimeter) is closer to what Alijah Martin brought to the table for May's Final Four FAU squad.  \nMichigan is 8-0, so everybody's happy here. The verdict: Everyone's ecstatic.  \n    \n                                        \n      2. G PJ Haggerty  Transferred from: Memphis  | To: Kansas StateThe numbers: 23.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists The scoop: Haggerty is carrying a ludicrous load for Kansas State. No high-major player has a higher usage rate, and the counting stats are ridiculous. But K-State (6-4) isn't winning ballgames. Jerome Tang made the right decision to pay up for Haggerty, but his other hefty wagers (Abdi Bashir Jr. and Andrej Kostic) have struggled, especially on the defensive end.  Individually, K-State's bet on Haggerty was sensible. Tang got what he wanted (a fulcrum), and so did Haggerty (a big bag and an insane role). Collectively, though? This isn't on a good trajectory because there aren't enough two-way players in this rotation. Even though it hit on its biggest offseason acquisition, an NCAA Tournament appearance appears unlikely for Kansas State, which is an awkward dichotomy. The verdict: Checks are cashing.  \n    \n                                        \n      3. PG Bennett Stirtz  Transferred from: Drake | To: IowaThe numbers: 18.8 points, 2.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 45% from 3-point range The scoop: Stirtz is doing what Stirtz does. The 6-4 lead guard has been excellent outside of a predictable clunker against a Michigan State defense that shuts down every driving lane. Iowa (8-1) is still very clearly figuring some stuff out, but Stirtz is keeping this train on the tracks. He has been the second-best point guard in the Big Ten. The verdict: Everyone's happy.  \n\n    \n                                        \n      4. PG Donovan Dent  Transferred from: New Mexico | To: UCLAThe numbers: 12.0 points, 2.4 rebounds, 6.4 assists The scoop: Both parties would likely admit they'd want more from this portal marriage. UCLA is actually playing faster offensively than any iteration of Mick Cronin-led hoops in Westwood, but this is still a significantly slower tempo than Dent is used to operating at. It hasn't helped that Dent's jumper has betrayed him in the early going. He is shooting just 17% on jump shots so far, and Cronin wants more from his preseason All-American on defense. Once Donovan Dent starts to look like Donovan Dent again, UCLA will be in fine shape. The verdict: Not ideal but not a disaster, yet.  \n    \n                                        \n      5. F Darrion Williams  Transferred from: Texas Tech | To: NC StateThe numbers: 16.7 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.4 assists The scoop: NC State has been a phenomenal offensive team when Darrion Williams is on the floor. The do-it-all forward has thrived as a go-to maestro of an offense, and he creates a galore of good looks for himself or others. The defense has left a bit to be desired, but Williams is primed to post the best numbers of his career. N.C. State would get into the D5 business again if it had a do-over. The verdict: All good.  \n    \n                                        \n      6. G Boogie Fland  Transferred from: Arkansas | To: FloridaThe numbers: 12.5 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.0 assists The scoop: Fland is making more layups (thanks to Florida's barrage of Gortat screens), playing better defense and getting to the free-throw line way more, but the jumper is off to a chilly start, which has covered up some of the real strides Fland has made. Once the jumper starts splashing -- as it did late against Duke -- Fland is going to be in great shape. It's only a matter of time. The verdict: It'll be fine.  \n\n    \n                                        \n      7. SG Ian Jackson  Transferred from: North Carolina | To: St. John'sThe numbers: 11.4 points, 2.5 rebounds, 1.0 assists The scoop: Jackson hasn't earned much trust from the St. John's staff, largely due to his struggles on the defensive end and a sky-high 23% turnover rate in pick-and-rolls. When you're not part of the best rebounding lineup or the best defensive grouping, it's hard to find tick. Everybody knows Jackson is a blur in transition and can add a flurry of 3s, but Jackson has not played more than 23 minutes in any game this season for a reason. That may not change if he doesn't meet Rick Pitino's benchmarks. The verdict: Not great.  \n    \n                                        \n      8. PG Rob Wright  Transferred from: Baylor | To: BYUThe numbers: 16.9 points, 4.0 rebounds, 6.3 assists The scoop: Wright has been outstanding for BYU, shredding as both a scorer and playmaker in pick-and-rolls. Wright has totalled a 2.4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio, and his paint-touch ability has been as advertised. Wright is taking and making more triples, which has made up for some iffy finishing at the cup. Maybe most importantly, Wright has made the game easier for everybody else on this roster, especially potential No. 1 pick, AJ Dybantsa. The verdict: Everyone's happy.  \n    \n                                        \n      9. G Adrian Wooley  Transferred from: Kennesaw State | To: LouisvilleThe numbers: 7.7 points, 4.7 rebounds, 1.2 assists The scoop: Accepting that he's the fourth guard in a stacked rotation isn't easy, but Wooley has bought into doing the little things to stay on the floor for a loaded Louisville club. He's casually averaging nearly two offensive rebounds, while supplying serviceable on-ball defense and a healthy amount of rim pressure. Mikel Brown Jr. and Ryan Conwell are the stars, but Wooley's time to shine could come next year if he's patient. The verdict: It's fine.  \n\n    \n                                        \n      10. F Jayden Quaintance  Transferred from: Arizona State | To: KentuckyThe numbers: N/A The scoop: The defensive phenom is still recovering from a torn ACL. Quaintance was able to log his first full practice on Monday, but the future lottery pick still has multiple hoops to jump through to get back onto the floor. It was always a risk for Kentucky to tie up some of its salary cap with a player like this coming off an injury like that. The verdict: Please God.  \n    \n                                        \n      11. C Moustapha Thiam  Transferred from: UCF | To: CincinnatiThe numbers: 9.8 points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.2 blocks The scoop: The 7-2 sophomore big man has certainly done his job defensively. Opponents shoot just 38% at the rim against Cincinnati when Thiam is on the floor, and he's established himself as one of the elite shot-blockers in the country. But his offense has been choppy, especially with those pick-and-pop 3-pointers not being part of the arsenal right now. Thiam certainly isn't the problem for Cincinnati, even if it may have envisioned a bit more when it plucked the big fella from Big 12 foe UCF. The verdict: Thiam is fine; Wes Miller isn't fine.  \n    \n                                        \n      12. PG Ja'Kobi Gillespie  Transferred from: Maryland | To: TennesseeThe numbers: 17.3 points, 2.7 rebounds, 5.4 assists The scoop: Gillespie is a total stud who is being asked to drive everything for an undermanned Vols' offense. In an ideal world, Gillespie is the 1B of this offense behind potential top-five pick, Nate Ament. But the five-star freshman has been shaky, which has shifted even more of the scoring and creation burden onto Gillespie's plate. The Maryland transfer is taking over 30% of Tennessee's shots when he's on the floor, while leading the team in assists by a country mile. Where would Tennessee's offense be without its fearless guard? I don't think Rick Barnes wants to know.   \nGillespie has been the real deal, but the Vols' secondary pieces have to step up to take some of the load off his plate. The verdict: Gillespie ain't the problem.  \n    \n                                        \n      13. G Silas Demary Jr.  Transferred from: Georgia | To: UConnThe numbers: 10.4 points, 4.7 rebounds, 5.6 assists The scoop: Demary has evolved into a set-the-table, floor general in Storrs. He's always made good decisions with the ball, but this year, he's being rewarded for it on the stat sheet because of all this offensive talent. This UConn club has loads of snipers, and Demary is already up to a career-high 36.1 assist rate. Demary's playmaking, defense and rebounding has been just what the doctor ordered, but Dan Hurley needs and demands more. There are times when UConn goes five or six possessions in a row without attempting a layup. That rim-pressure from Demary will loom large to help this offense go from great to spectacular. The verdict: All good here.\n    \n                                        \n      14. G Ryan Conwell  Transferred from: Xavier | To: LouisvilleThe numbers: 19.7 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 42% from 3-point range The scoop: Conwell in this Louisville scheme is a cheat code. He's a lethal catch-and-shoot and movement shooter with sky-high efficiency and zero fear. Conwell has blended the threat of his dynamic shooting with some bully-ball drives. He's averaging 1.5 points per possession on drives this year, per Synergy. He's a ludicrously hard guy to cover. Louisville was ecstatic about landing Conwell, and he's been even better than expected. The verdict: Everybody's ecstatic.\n\n    \n                                        \n      15. PG Dedan Thomas Jr.  Transferred from: UNLV | To: LSU  The numbers: 15.2 points, 2.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists The scoop: LSU needed a dude at point guard, and paying up for Thomas has aged well. He can make every pass, and he possesses a lofty IQ, excellent feel, a slick pull-up game and confrontational drives. All of that has translated to LSU through the first nine games. His 4-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio is insane, even if that likely will tick down once LSU starts playing SEC teams every night. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      16. F Bryce Hopkins  Transferred from: Providence | To: St. John'sThe numbers: 15.1 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists  The scoop: St. John's is tinkering with some things, but Bryce Hopkins ain't one of them. Now healthy, Hopkins has been one of the best players in the Big East. He's a bruising battering ram, who is so hard to defend without fouling and the extra splash of playmaking and perimeter shot-making has been helpful. The big-to-big passing between Zuby Ejiofor and Hopkins is something that St. John's may have to lean into even more to find some answers. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n\n    \n                                        \n      17. F Keyshawn Hall  Transferred from: UCF | To: AuburnThe numbers: 20.8 points, 8.6 rebounds, 1.8 assists The scoop: Hall is going to make a real run at the SEC scoring title with this role. He's the alpha of this Auburn offense, and he may be the best isolation scorer in America. The combination of strong left-hand drives, backdowns, 3-pointers and pull-ups are a headache. He's drawing over seven fouls per 40 minutes and shooting 91% at the charity stripe. That'll play all day, every day. The challenge for Hall is to limit the damage on the turnovers and not be a total liability defensively. But overall, Auburn has gotten everything it wanted and more out of Hall. You can see why he was such a priority for Steven Pearl and company. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      18. G/F Tucker DeVries  Transferred from: West Virginia | To: IndianaThe numbers: 17.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 41% from 3-point range  The scoop: DeVries is just always in the right place at the right time. He's always a threat to fire from the moment he crosses halfcourt, and no Big Ten player has made more 3-pointers (33) than DeVries. He's a terrifying off-movement, quick-trigger shooter who might be even more dangerous as a screener. He's easily been Indiana's best player, even if there aren't a ton of easy buckets in the profile these days. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      19. G Josh Dix  Transferred from: Iowa | To: CreightonThe numbers: 11.7 points, 2.6 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 35% from 3-point range  The scoop: Dix has been solid with serviceable efficiency metrics at all three levels. But he's more of a deferential offensive player who prefers to find his buckets in the flow of the offense. That's fine, but Creighton's at-large hopes are circling the drain after blowout losses to Nebraska, Gonzaga and Iowa State. The Bluejays need their biggest offseason acquisition to start pushing the pedal to the floor to get this season back on track. Creighton is still looking for an alpha, and Dix, ideally, is the best bet to wear that heavy crown. The verdict: Getting nervous.\n\n    \n                                        \n      20. G Isaac McKneely  Transferred from: Virginia | To: LouisvilleThe numbers: 12.4 points, 3.6 rebounds, 0.8 assists, 43% from 3-point range  The scoop: McKneely is on the floor to do one thing: shoot that pill. He's been up to the challenge. He's up to 43% from downtown on 7.7 attempts from beyond the arc. 70 of his 81 shots are 3-pointers, which makes for a funny-looking shot chart. For this jam-packed Louisville squad, McKneely has to be a role player, not a star like he was at Virginia. He's doing his job. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      21. G/F Chad Baker-Mazara  Transferred from: Auburn | To: USCThe numbers: 20.9 points, 5.3 rebounds, 2.3 assists The scoop: Even with a much bigger offensive role, Baker-Mazara has kept his efficiency afloat. That's really impressive. He still makes audacious passes and can be a wild card, but it's been a worthy gamble for Eric Musselman and the USC staff. Baker-Mazara is up to 37% from downtown, 53% on 2-pointers and 89% at the charity stripe to go along with his typical yeoman's work on the glass and defensively. He's a really effective hooper, regardless of role. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      22. G Joson Sanon  Transferred from: Arizona State | To: St. John'sThe numbers: 9.8 points, 3.0 rebounds, 0.6 assists  The scoop: You can see the flashes with Sanon. He's a talented offensive shot-maker who is draining 44% of his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, but he has to round out the rough edges of his game. The defense has not been up to par. He's struggled to finish at the rim. He has five assists and 11 turnovers. It's been hard for Pitino to play Sanon and Jackson together (-6.9 net rating in 46 minutes, per CBB Analytics) because their games clash at times. That has to flip if St. John's wants to reach the peak of its powers. The verdict: Not ideal but there's still time.  \n    \n                                        \n      23. F LeJuan Watts  Transferred from: Washington State | To: Texas TechThe numbers: 12.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.1 assists  The scoop: Watts isn't starting anymore, but he's still playing starter's minutes as Texas Tech works some kinks out with this new-look rotation. Watts is pretty clearly Texas Tech's third fiddle, who has shown extra edge on the glass. He has multiple offensive rebounds in five of eight games, to go along with his barrage of backdowns, post-ups and mismatch-hunting drives. Texas Tech doesn't have much to worry about with Watts. He's an excellent No. 3 behind JT Toppin and Christian Anderson. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      24. G Wesley Yates  Transferred from: USC | To: WashingtonThe numbers: 16.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 1.0 assistsThe scoop: There are a lot of mouths to feed in this UW attack, so Yates has had some up-and-down performances as he figures out his job description next to a big man like Hannes Steinbach and another ball-dominant guard like Desmond Claude. Yates attacking long closeouts is a scary proposition for opposing defenses, and the chiseled guard is always in attack mode. Washington knows what it's getting from Yates more often than not. That's comforting. The verdict: No problems here.  \n    \n                                        \n      25. G Rodney Rice  Transferred from: Maryland | To: USCThe numbers: 20.3 points, 3.3 rebounds, 6.0 assists The scoop: A shoulder injury is the only thing that could slow down Rice, who had started out red hot for USC. Through six games, Rice was shooting 39% from downtown and 60% at the rim to go along with his usual excellent pull-up game. Oh, and he had a 3-to-1, assist-to-turnover ratio. If he can get healthy, Rice is due for a monster year in Eric Musselman's \"find a mismatch, punish said mismatch\" offense. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      26. F/C Morez Johnson  Transferred from: Illinois | To: MichiganThe numbers: 14.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 1.0 assists The scoop: Johnson gets the third-most attention in the Michigan frontcourt behind Lendeborg and Aday Mara's freakshow performances, but he has done his job for the Wolverines. Johnson has a ridiculous motor, and he's impossible to keep off the glass. His top KenPom player comps are Montrezl Harrell and Oscar Tshiebwe, which checks out flawlessly. He's a know-your-role All-Star. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      27. C Henri Veesaar  Transferred from: Arizona | To: UNCThe numbers: 16.2 points, 9.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists  The scoop: Veesaar was paid like he was one of the elite big men in the portal, and he has been worth every single penny from the new UNC braintrust. He is a perfect fit next to fantastic freshman, Caleb Wilson, because of his ability to pass, shoot, cut and punish switches. Veesaar's defensive rebounding was questioned at times, but he's risen to the occasion on that front, helping UNC punk Georgetown and Kentucky on the glass last week. He's frankly been outstanding. UNC has a whopping +34 net rating when Veesaar is on the floor. It plunges to -6.4 when he sits. Veesaar has been one of the most valuable players in America.   If we re-ranked the top portal prospects right now, Veesaar would be a lot higher than No. 27. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      28. F KeShawn Murphy  Transferred from: Mississippi State | To: AuburnThe numbers: 10.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.5 assists The scoop: Numerous injuries have slowed the Murphy Breakout Train, but it is looming sooner rather than later. Murphy is one of the most productive, per-minute players for Auburn, especially now that his 3-ball has become a strength. The 6-10 big man has so much skill. The behind-the-back passes, defensive versatility and feathery touch in the in-between game form a tantalizing combination. Auburn can't be the best version of itself without Murphy becoming the third-best player on this team. Stay healthy and let's hoop. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n    \n                                        \n      29. G Xaivian Lee  Transferred from: Princeton | To: FloridaThe numbers: 8.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.6 assists  The scoop: Lee's entire profile screams positive regression. 21% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, 20% on pull-up treys and 38% at the rim are all career-low marks. Lee just has to be better. I would expect some of the rim numbers to go up as he gets more comfortable navigating tight spaces around Florida's cavalry of bigs, who are excellent at clearing open paths to the basket. But it's fair to wonder how shifting to more of an off-ball role has impacted some of his comfort as a shot-maker. The verdict: It's getting late, early.\n    \n                                        \n      30. G Xzayvier Brown  Transferred from: St. Joseph's | To: OklahomaThe numbers: 13.1 points, 2.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists  The scoop: It was a no-brainer move for Oklahoma to hire St. Joseph's assistant Justin Scott and reel in Scott's stepson, Brown, to anchor this backcourt. Brown has been productive playing on or off the ball, and he's a total blur in the open floor. Hindsight is 20/20, but it's fair to wonder if pairing Brown with an undersized combo guard like Nijel Pack was the right move because of the defensive issues that have plagued OU in the early going. But Brown is the real deal. The verdict: Everybody's happy.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        In this Bizarro World of the NFL's 2025 season where Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson are currently on the outside looking in on the playoff",
    "body": "\n        In this Bizarro World of the NFL's 2025 season where Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson are currently on the outside looking in on the playoffs and a quarterback can somehow throw an interception and fumble on the same play, why not throw a Philip Rivers return into the mix, right? Remarkably, the 44-year-old quarterback is back in the NFL following a five-year hiatus, inking a deal to join the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad.Of course, this comes on the heels of Indy losing starting quarterback Daniel Jones for the season due to a torn Achilles that he suffered in Sunday's loss against the Jaguars. Jones' season-ending injury created a hole at the position, and forced the franchise, which is still in the playoff race at 8-5, to explore its options and call Rivers, who worked out for the team on Tuesday. The session went well enough that Indianapolis signed him to its practice squad, thus bringing him out of retirement.\nBut what does this all mean? How did we get here? What has Rivers been doing all this time? Let's break down each piece of this wonderfully random return by the NFL legend.What has Philip Rivers been doing in retirement?Let's not forget, Rivers has 10 (!) children, so it's not like he's been simply chilling on some remote island in his post-playing days. In fact, he's stayed close to the game, serving as a high school football coach at Fairhope (Ala.) St. Michael Catholic. He's been with the program since 2021 and is 44-16 overall as the coach, which includes a 13-1 campaign in 2025.\nThere, Rivers has been coaching one of his sons, Gunner Rivers, who is a highly touted prospect in the 2027 class. 247Sports has Gunner Rivers listed as a four-star recruit and the No. 6-ranked quarterback nationally. He currently has offers from Auburn, Boston College, Miami, South Carolina and his father's alma mater, NC State.Is there any precedent for a 44-year-old QB to returnSeeing a quarterback Rivers' age start in a game is rare but not unprecedented. If he were to start for Indianapolis at some point this season, he would be just the fifth starting QB in NFL history age 44 or older, joining Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg.However, when you pair his extended absence, we haven't seen anything quite of this magnitude. For instance, Sunday will mark 1,800 days since Rivers' last NFL start (Jan. 9, 2021, versus the Bills). If he were to start this weekend against Seattle (which is still a major question), Rivers would be the first 40-plus-year-old quarterback to play with at least 1,800 days in between starts. The current record is 1,777 days held by DeBerg in 1998, who started one game that season at age 44 after being retired for four years.\nHow did Philip Rivers look last time?As noted, it's been a minute since we've seen Rivers on an NFL field. Before this return, his final career game was as a member of the Colts during the 2020 season. Specifically, it came during the wild-card round of the playoffs that year, where Indy fell to the Buffalo Bills, 27-24.In that game, Rivers completed 27 of his 46 passes for 309 yards and two touchdowns and took Buffalo to the brink. The game was determined on the final play of regulation as Rivers heaved a Hail Mary from midfield to T.Y. Hilton, but Buffalo defensive back Micah Hyde knocked it down to clinch the win for the Bills. \nDuring the regular season, Rivers led the Colts to an 11-5 record while throwing for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He completed 68% of his passes that year with a 97 passer rating.\nWhy is Indy in this QB situation?While this is a fun story to see Rivers back in the NFL, you know it means that the Colts have fallen into utter catastrophe by needing to make this move. Of course, the big piece is Jones, who's out. Instantly, when Jones went down with the non-contact injury, the fears of an Achilles sprouted and ultimately realized.\nBut this also goes beyond Jones. Indy's in-house options at quarterback are also dinged up. Anthony Richardson, the team's first-round pick in 2023, is on injured reserve due to a fracture to his orbital bone in his eye that he suffered during pregame warmups before the team's Week 6 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals. That had rookie Riley Leonard as Jones' primary backup, and the Notre Dame product went in under duress following his injury.While filling in for Jones, Leonard suffered a knee injury, but coach Shane Steichen did indicate earlier this week that the team hopes Leonard will be available this week against the Seahawks. If he's ruled out, that'd create even more momentum for Rivers to be activated off the practice squad and start immediately.\nHow Philip Rivers' return impacts his Hall of Fame bidYou know it's been a long time since you've been in the NFL when you're in contention for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Rivers was eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame for the first time this year and was recently among the 26 modern-era candidates to be a semifinalist for induction into Canton, Ohio, next summer.However, if Rivers is signed to the Colts' active roster, his eligibility resets, and he would have to wait another five years. Because Rivers is currently signed to the practice squad, he is, momentarily, still eligible for the Hall of Fame, but that could change rather quickly.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Counted out by many following a disastrous stretch in which he lost three of four fights and his UFC bantamweight title, Petr Yan never gave up hope that a return to the top of the 135-pound division was inevitable. Yan, the 32-year-old native of Russia, completed his impressive turnaround last weekend at UFC 323 in Las Vegas when he extended his current win streak to four by upsetting Merab Dvalishvili to reclaim the bantamweight crown via unanimous decision. The victory wasn't merely surprising because of the hot streak Dvalishvili was riding as the most accomplished bantamweight champion in UFC history who was riding an incredible 14-fight win streak and on the verge of potentially securing history as the first champion to make four title defenses in a single calendar year (which would've cemented \"The Machine\" as consensus fighter of the year). What was most shocking was the ease in which Yan appeared to shut Dvalishvili down in every aspect of the game.Two years after Yan, who was battling a broken hand, dropped a decision to Dvalishvili in their non-title bout, he returned as an even more well-rounded fighter by switching stances and outboxing the defending champion (while damaging his face in the process). Yan also routinely stuffed the takedowns of Dvalishvili while scoring five of his own. \nThe most impressive part of the performance, however, was the fact that Yan became the first Dvalishvili opponent to truly match him in the cardio department over 25 minutes. Yan was in command throughout as he showcased just how well he and his team did in auditing Dvalishvili's game to limit his effectiveness. Dvalishvili called for an immediate trilogy fight after the loss but given how dominant Yan truly was, there may not be a need for it just yet. Yan, who initially lost his title by disqualification against Aljamain Sterling in 2021 (before losing a pair of elite bouts shortly after by disputed split decision), is back on top and seemingly better than ever.UFC 323 was a shining example of just how hard it truly is to maintain a lengthy run atop any division as losses to P4P-ranked champions Dvalishvili and Alexandre Pantoja left Valentina Shevchenko, who has made two title defenses in her second reign as women's flyweight champion, as the longest reigning titleholder of any division at the moment. \nMen's pound-for-pound rankings1. Islam Makhachev -- Welterweight championRecord: 28-1 | Previous ranking: No. 1Makhachev turned UFC 322 in November into a night of historical conquest as the former lightweight champion dominated Jack Della Maddalena with his grappling over five rounds to become the 11th two-division champion in UFC history. The 34-year-old also equaled Anderson Silva's record for consecutive wins with 16. Makhachev now must deal with a hungry group of contenders in the sport's deepest division at 170 pounds. \n2. Ilia Topuria -- Lightweight championRecord: 17-0 | Previous ranking: No. 2Topuria took a massive step forward in becoming the new face of the promotion by knocking out Charles Oliveira at UFC 317 in June to capture the vacant lightweight title. The first unbeaten, two-division champion in UFC history just might have the most technical and explosive boxing skills the Octagon has ever seen. Topuria announced he will take some time off to open 2026 in order to deal with personal issues.3. Alex Pereira -- Light heavyweight championRecord: 13-3 | Previous ranking: No. 4Talk about a comeback victory. The 37-year-old Brazilian slugger had looked sluggish in a decision loss against the technical Magomed Ankalaev in March. Vowing to return at full health after competing at just 40% of himself, Pereira wasted no time in finishing Ankalaev in their October rematch at UFC 320 to regain the title and call for a much-anticipated move up to heavyweight and a third title in as many divisions.\n4. Khamzat Chimaev -- Middleweight championRecord: 15-0 | Previous ranking: No. 5Despite years of inactivity due to injury, illness and bad luck, Chimaev proved at UFC 319 in August just how dangerous he truly is when fully healthy. He also shut up any critics wondering if he possessed five-round cardio by utterly dominating Dricus du Plessis on the ground in a shutout decision. While many fans referred to the gameplan that Chimaev executed against DDP as boring, the performance sent a stern message to the rest of the pack at 185 pounds that Chimaev is ready to begin a new era.5. Petr Yan -- Bantamweight championRecord: 20-5 | Previous ranking: NRThe former 135-pound champion completed an incredible comeback after losing three of four fights from 2021 to 2023. Yan brought a three-fight win streak into his UFC 323 rematch against Merab Dvalishvili in December and outright dominated the defending champion in every aspect to claim a unanimous decision (and retribution). At 32, the native of Russia appears reborn and even more well-rounded than his first title run, which began in 2020 and lasted only eight months. 6. Alexandre Pantoja -- FlyweightRecord: 30-6 | Previous ranking: No. 6In what amounted to nothing more than a case of bad luck at the wrong time, Panotja badly injured his left elbow just 26 seconds into his UFC 323 title defense in December against Joshua Van when he put his arm down to catch himself after being thrown and immediately lost his flyweight title due to the fight being called off because of the gruesome injury. At 35, with a long layoff likely in his future, it's hard to say exactly where Pantoja goes from here and whether he will return to his previous stature. \n7. Alexander Volkanovski -- Featherweight championRecord: 27-4 | Previous ranking: No. 7A 14-month layoff did the 36-year-old Volkanovski good as he rebounded from a pair of knockout losses to the two best fighters in the world by brilliantly outpointing Diego Lopes to capture the vacant 145-pound title at UFC 314 in April. Now a two-time champion, Volkanovski proved, even this late in his career, that skills, IQ and timing can still defeat youth and power. A rematch with Diego Lopes will headline UFC 325 in Australia on Jan. 31.8. Dricus du Plessis -- MiddleweightRecord: 22-3 | Previous ranking: No. 8As impressive as du Plessis' first nine trips to the Octagon truly were, he proved quickly out of answers in yielding his middleweight title to unbeaten Khamzat Chimaev at UFC 319 in August. DDP simply had nothing for Chimaev on the ground and looked like a novice despite showing toughness and a willingness to keep fighting. A late rally in the closing seconds, aided by two referee standups, wasn't enough to save face in a one-sided dismantling.9. Tom Aspinall -- Heavyweight championRecord: 15-3 (1 NC) | Previous ranking: No. 9The 32-year-old British slugger with some of the fastest hands the division has seen finally earned undisputed champion status when Jon Jones vacated his title and briefly retired earlier this year. Aspinall, who previously defended his interim title last summer, returned in October to defend the belt against Cyril Gane at UFC 321. Unfortunately, a double eye poke late in Round 1 compromised Aspinall's vision and led to a no contest. His return remains uncertain as the possibility of surgery on both eyes awaits him.\n10. Merab Dvalishvili -- BantamweightRecord: 21-5 | Previous ranking: No. 3In hindsight, was \"The Machine\" overly ambitious in attempting to become the first UFC champion to make four title defenses in a calendar year? It's hard to say. What we can say is that Dvalishvili was thoroughly dominated by Petr Yan in their UFC 323 rematch in December, which cost the native of Georgia not just 135-pound title and fighter of the year honors but it also brought an end to his 14-fight win streak. After the loss, Dvalishvili called for an immediate trilogy.Dropped out: Umar NurmagomedovJust missed: Nurmagomedov, Shavkat Rakhkmonov, Magomed Ankalaev, Jack Della Maddalena, Joshua Van (c)Women's pound-for-pound rankings1. Valentina Shevchenko -- Flyweight championRecord: 26-4-1 | Previous ranking: No. 1If there was any lingering debate as to who was most deserving of being called the pound-for-pound queen, Shevchenko reminded us of her greatness at UFC 322 in November by relying on her grappling to completely neutralize two-time strawweight champion Weili Zhang. The only question now for the 37-year-old is whether she will move back up to 135 pounds to seek a second UFC title and deeper consideration within the G.O.A.T. debate.\n2. Kayla Harrison -- Bantamweight championRecord: 19-1 | Previous ranking: No. 2Despite enduring an insane cut to make championship weight of 135 pounds, Harrison dominated two-time champion Juianna Pena at UFC 316 in June to capture the women's bantamweight title. A showdown against former champion (and former teammate) Amanda Nunes is up next and will serve as the co-main event to UFC 324 in January. Harrison has also said she would love to fight Valentina Shevchenko at the White House in June. 3. Zhang Weili -- Strawweight/FlyweightRecord: 26-4 | Previous ranking: No. 3After two title reigns at strawweight, the 35-year-old Chinese star vacated her title in search of cementing her legacy by moving up to flyweight. Unfortunately for Zhang, her attempt to capture a world title in a second division came up definitively short in a wide 5-round decision loss to Valentina Shevchenko. Zhang was soundly dominated by the grappling and defensive skills of her larger foe and now must decide whether to stay at 125 pounds or move back down. 4. Manon Fiorot -- FlyweightRecord: 13-2 | Previous ranking: No. 4The 35-year-old native of France snapped an impressive 7-0 start to her UFC career by coming up just short in a close decision loss to champion Valentina Shevchenko at UFC 315 in June. But, to Fiorot's credit, her October return against a streaking Jasmine Jasudavicius was a stark reminder at how talented and title-ready she remains. Fiorot recorded a first-round TKO in a showcase of her explosive boxing skills.\n5. Natalia Silva -- FlyweightRecord: 19-5-1 | Previous ranking: No. 5Unbeaten in seven trips to the Octagon, Silva earned a decision in May at UFC 315 against former champion Alexa Grasso to put the 28-year-old native of Brazil in position for a possible title shot. The dynamic striker has won 13 fights in a row overall since a 2017 loss on the regional scene to Marina Rodriguez. In January, she returns on short notice to face former two-time strawweight queen Rose Namajunas at UFC 324 in Las Vegas.Dropped out: NoneJust missed: Maycee Barber, Erin Blanchfield, Mackenzie Dern (c), Julianna Pena, Tatiana Suarez\n            ",

Notre Dame was not the only team to forgo its postseason opportunity -- Iowa State and Kansas State also notably passed on their eligibility, among others -- but it is now at the center of the conversation about bowl season's long-term future.With its 10-2 record at No. 11 ranking, Notre Dame would have been a top candidate for the most prestigious non-playoff bowls. But as the CFP continues to diminish the value of bowl games, the Fighting Irish's bracket snub played a key role in their election to call it a season and cast further doubt on the sustainability of the traditional bowl format.\"It was a decision that I applaud,\" Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua said in a Tuesday press conference. \"I think it was a hard decision. I think they knew it was going to be a hard decision. I think they knew it was going to be a decision that not everybody was going to love. But it was the right decision for this team at this moment. I'm positive of that.\"Bevacqua said that in addition to the CFP snub, Notre Dame also weighed the value of allowing its players to focus on final exams and to return home for the holidays in assessing its desire to play in a bowl game. The decision largely rested on the shoulders of the team captains, with whom coach Marcus Freeman consulted in making the decision.\n\"The unanimous message that came back was we are such a close team, those guys in that locker room, that they want to make sure that the last team that took the field as part of the 2025 Notre Dame season was the same team that took the field when we got off the plane in Miami (for the season opener),\" Bevacqua said. \"They didn't feel it was right for this team to make the decision to go out there and not be that full team that has been so close together.\"Notre Dame's move set a precedent that other teams may follow in the years to come. It is already common for players on non-playoff teams to opt out of bowl games and instead begin their pursuit of NFL careers or opportunities through the transfer portal. Now that entire teams have begun to decline postseason berths, Pandora's box may be open for good.\nReaching the playoff will become a touch easier for Notre Dame starting next season. A memorandum of understanding signed by the university states that the Fighting Irish will be assured a playoff berth if it ranks inside the top 12. Had that clause gone into effect in 2025, the No. 11-ranked Fighting Irish would not have had a bowl decision to make in the first place.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.Among other things, December in the baseball world is the time to discuss the Baseball Hall of Fame. There's an Era Committee vote and BBWAA Hall of Fame ballots are due by Dec. 31. And discussing the Hall of Fame these days means fights on social media platforms. Everything is so dramatic and needlessly dialed all the way up to 100. First off, no, the Hall of Fame most certainly isn't a \"joke\" just because it doesn't have everything perfectly how you want it.Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens aren't in, which means it's a joke!Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens don't deserve to be in and it's a joke that they're even being discussed!\nJeff Kent made the Hall of Fame. What a joke. It's a joke that Kent wasn't already in since he's the all-time leader in home runs by a second baseman. Yeah, but it was already a joke when Scott Rolen got in, so whatever.You clown, Rolen definitely deserved to make it!It's embarrassing that Fred McGriff got in but Dale Murphy and Don Mattingly can't make it! Murphy and Mattingly are Hall of the Very Good types, they don't belong! Oh, and of course, \"writers shouldn't vote for this.\" Yeah, we should. No, we didn't play in the majors, but we're the ones who study the statistics and also talk to players about their peers. If you don't think we're qualified, you're entitled to your opinion, but who is? The players? You throw fits every year about the All-Star Game selections that the players make. \nAnother thing that needs to go is when people say, \"this doesn't make any sense\" just because they disagree. For example, my line drawn on any PED-related player is that I won't vote for him if he was suspended by the league once there was a Joint Drug Agreement in place. If not, fair game. So I would've been a yes on Bonds and Clemens and I'm a no on A-Rod. Even if you don't like the argument, which is totally fair and fine, you don't get to tell me that \"it doesn't make sense.\" Yes, it does. You just disagree with my stance. There's a difference. It's a microcosm of the larger issue at hand here. So many people have decided that their opinion is the correct one and anyone who disagrees is ignorant or nefarious or doesn't deserve a vote or whatever. How about a little respectful disagreement? I think Kent is a perfectly defensible Hall of Fame selection. He was one of the greatest sluggers ever among second basemen. His WAR is a bit less than average for a Hall of Famer at the position, but there's room for all types of Hall of Famers. Yes, I believe Bobby Grich and Lou Whitaker should be in, but they weren't on this ballot. That doesn't make the system broken. It makes it imperfect. \nWhile we're here, let's also discuss a subsection of people who will make a point to tell you how much they definitely don't even care about the Hall of Fame. It's perfectly fine if you don't care about it, but a word to the wise: If you don't care about something, you don't spend hours arguing about it. For example, I don't care about, say, soap operas. So I never discuss them. See? It's easy. If you don't care, get outta here and stop talking about it.Anyway ... I saw a bunch of people pointing out that Bonds was getting walked so many times -- many intentionally -- because teams in the early 2000s would rather face Kent than Bonds. That's a fair point in favor of Bonds. I don't think it detracts from Kent at all because Bonds in those years was the greatest hitter in the history of the sport. No team would have rather faced Bonds than any other player.And if you disagree with me and think Kent is not a defensible selection, that's fine. I respect your stance. \nI don't respect the nonstop negativity about the Hall of Fame process, again, just because it isn't perfectly tailored to what you think it is supposed to be. People lecture me on social media about this all the time. \"The Hall of Fame isn't supposed to be ... \" or \"the Hall of Fame is supposed to be ... \"No, you don't get to decide that. Neither do I. What I do get to decide is to tell everyone to stop whining so much about a museum. You don't need to see plaques for Bonds and Clemens to know how great they were and you sure aren't harmed by plaques for McGriff and Rolen and Kent and Harold Baines. \nThe Baseball Hall of Fame is positive in nature. I like it. I like discussing it. Please join me in positivity. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Dodgers are always active in free agency, and they landed their first big fish of the offseason Tuesday, signing All-Star closer Edwin Diaz to a three-year deal. The deal will reportedly pay him $69 million, a far cry from the $102 million, record-breaking deal he signed with the Mets the last time he was a free agent, though still a record for annual average value for a reliever.It comes one year after the Dodgers signed Tanner Scott to one of the largest contracts ever for a reliever, though that obviously didn't go well. Scott struggled in his first year with the Dodgers, lowering his walk rate to the lowest of his career but also dealing with the lowest strikeout rate of his career en route to a 4.74 ERA and eventually losing the closer job. Scott now slides into a setup role, though he serves as a cautionary tale for Diaz, who is now joining a team with plenty of alternatives if he stumbles.And Diaz is, well, known for stumbling. He usually rights himself and is often one of the most dominant closers in baseball, as he was in 2025 when he put up a 1.63 ERA with 98 strikeouts in 66.1 innings of work. When he's on top of his game, Diaz is about as unhittable as anyone in baseball, as he was when he struck out 50.2% of batters in 2022, the third-highest single-season rate in baseball history. But it's not always smooth sailing with him. He was dominant in 2025, of course, but actually lost his job at one point in 2024. He finished the season with a 3.52 ERA and has alternated sub-2.00 ERA seasons with marks in the 3.50 range – and had a 5.59 ERA back in 2019, his first season with the Mets. His strikeout rate has taken a step back in the past couple of seasons, and there are occasional bouts of wildness and homer issues that have caused plenty of consternation for his managers and fans.\nAnd the Dodgers have alternatives, obviously. Scott should bounce back and return to being a capable late-inning option, if not the dominant shutdown one the Dodgers paid him to be; Blake Treinen has some closer experience; they could even turn to Roki Sasaki in a high-leverage role if he stumbles as a starter again, as they did at the end of 2025. And as we saw with Scott last season, the Dodgers are willing to be flexible with the closer job even if they're paying the main guy a bunch of money.I don't expect Diaz to lose his job. I expect him to have a longer leash than Scott and ultimately be more successful. But relievers are unpredictable in the best of circumstances, and Diaz has been volatile throughout his career. And then there's this: For the Dodgers, all that matters is October. They want to use the regular season to get their ducks in a row and make sure they are aligned for the playoffs. Blake Snell just pitched 61.1 innings for the Dodgers in the regular season, and they almost certainly view that as a huge success because he was healthy and dominant in the playoffs. If they feel like pulling Diaz from the closer's role for a month or two if he struggles will help him get back on track for the games that really matter, I suspect they won't hesitate to. \nWhich is all to say, while Diaz generally has as much upside as any closer in baseball, there might be more ways for this to go wrong than there are for other top-shelf closers. He should be one of the first off the board in most drafts, but I wouldn't have him as the first – that would be Mason Miller, now that the Padres have confirmed he will be the closer in 2026. Diaz should be the next man up, but be warned that it could be a bumpier ride than you might think. \n            ",

The Under is 8-3 over the last 11 Heat games, despite Miami having the No. 3 scoring offense in the league. The Magic have consistently been one of the better defensive teams in the league over recent seasons, and that has continued this year as Orlando ranks eighth in scoring defense at 113.6 points per game allowed. Orlando plays its first game without leading scorer Franz Wagner, who suffered an ankle injury, and that could hinder the Magic's scoring. The model projects the Under to hit in 60.3% of simulations. Back the Magic at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Raptors (-4.5) vs. Knicks (-108)The Raptors have lost five of their last six games, but before then, Toronto won 13 of 14 games as a part of a 14-5 start to the season in a roller coaster of a start for Toronto. The Raptors enter Tuesday at 15-10 on the year, but they went 4-0 in NBA Cup contests and the younger, up-and-coming team has clearly prioritized the in-season tournament. Brandon Ingram (21.2 points per game) and Scottie Barnes (20 ppg) make a formidable 1-2 combo, and the Raptors are 8-5 at home this season. The model projects the Raptors to cover in 52% of simulations. Back the Raptors at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Long Beach State (+7.5) vs. San Jose State (-108)\"Having seen the Beach in person last Saturday, we have a new perspective of Chris Acker's bunch,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"The new faces are beginning to mesh, though there's a good chance Acker will be coaching some of these newcomers for only the rest of this season before they move elsewhere. That would include impressive frosh guard Gavin Sykes, who's scored 20+ points in four of the past five games, while 6-8 Syracuse transfer Petar Majstorovic is scoring almost 17 ppg across the past four. Recent Beach efforts vs. UCSD and UCSB would be good enough keep this one close. Meanwhile, some positives for Tim Miles' SJSU, but the Spartans are looking for reliable options aside from Longwood transfer G Tracy Garland (17.9 ppg).\" Back Long Beach State at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        A season which began in late August is reaching its conclusion, with that being the 2025-26 college football bowl schedule. There are 46 FBS bowl games, so there are no shortage of opportunities to make college football bowl bets. The LA Bowl kicks things off on Saturday with Washington vs. Boise State (+8.5), with the CFP First Round starting on Dec. 19. The opener is a matchup of Blue Bloods as Alabama is a 1.5-point road favorite over Oklahoma per the latest college football bowl odds.  That's one of a handful of games with a college football spread of 2 points or fewer. Others include Louisiana vs. Delaware (+2.5), Arizona State vs. Duke (-1.5) and Navy vs. Cincinnati (+1.5). The largest of the college football bowl spreads comes in the CFP, with Oregon favored by 21.5 points versus James Madison. Other games of interest include powerhouse programs facing off, such as Penn State vs. Clemson (-3.5) in the Pinstripe Bowl and Michigan vs. Texas (-455) in the Citrus Bowl.Before locking in any college football bowl picks, be sure to see the latest Championship Week college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting lines on the spread, money line and over/under. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top college football predictions for bowl seasonOne of the college football picks the model is high on during the 2025-26 college football bowl schedule: Penn State (+3.5, 48.5) covers against Clemson in the Pinstripe Bowl on Saturday, Dec. 27 at noon ET. Both schools vastly underperformed this year but had strong finishes, with each finishing the season 3-1 ATS. However, Dabo Swinney has lost four of his last six bowl games, with each defeat coming by at least 14 points. This year, his Tigers are averaging 28.7 points, which ranks 61st in the nation, while Penn State, despite playing in the much tougher Big Ten, ranks 37th nationally in scoring. Also, the location of this game in New York City favors a northeastern university like Penn State over Clemson from South Carolina. The Nittany Lions cover almost 60% of the time, while the model also says the Under hits in almost 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Missouri (-6.5, 48.5) covers versus No. 20 Virginia in the Gator Bowl on Dec. 27 in well over 50% of simulations. UVA is coming off an ACC Title Game loss to Duke, in which the Cavaliers would have made the CFP if they had won. Thus, you have to wonder about motivation now that they have to settle for a lesser bowl game, and Virginia has struggled in bowls to begin with, going 1-4 over the last 19 years. Mizzou has won back-to-back bowls under Eli Drinkwitz, and the Tigers' only losses this season came versus teams ranked in the top 10 of the AP Poll at the time. Missouri is 4-1 ATS at neutral sites since Drinkwitz took over in 2020, and the Tigers are 12-4 ATS as favorites since the start of last season. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for bowl seasonThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every 2025-26 college football bowl game, and it's calling for five underdogs to outright win in bowl matchups of power conference teams. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs are projected to win outright?

    "body": "\n        Two weeks ago, after being traded to the Red Sox for two young pitchers, veteran righty Sonny Gray endeared himself to the locals, saying he's happy to be in \"a place where it's easy to hate the Yankees.\" Gray was traded to the Yankees at the 2017 deadline and spent a tumultuous season and a half in New York before being flipped to the Reds.\"It just wasn't a good situation for me,\" Gray said during his introductory Zoom call with the BoSox. \"It wasn't a great setup for me and my family. I never wanted  to go there in the first place.\"Aaron Boone, who managed Gray with the Yankees in 2018, said Monday at the Winter Meetings that \"he's not supposed to like us anyway (because he's a Red Sox),\" and if Gray wants to \"spice up the rivalry a little, there's nothing wrong with that.\" Boone also said that, at the time, he didn't get the sense Gray hated being with the Yankees.Yankees GM Brian Cashman peeled back the curtain a bit more this past Sunday, saying Gray told him \"he hates New York\" and \"this is the worst place\" after the 2018 trade deadline. Cashman also said Gray was told by his agent, Bo McKinnis, to say he wanted to be a Yankee because it would help him come free agent time. Here's MLB.com with the details:\n\"When he was with the A's,\" Cashman recalled, \"he was telling our Minor  League video coordinator, 'You've got to get me over to the Yankees.  Tell Cash, get me over to the Yankees. I want out of Oakland. I want to  win a world championship.' He was communicating that to a number of  different people, and it was getting to us, that he wants to be a  Yankee.\"...During  the closed-door conversation (after the 2018 trade deadline), Cashman said he confronted Gray about the  discrepancy: \"But you said you wanted to be traded here.\"According  to Cashman, Gray's response was: \"My agent, Bo McKinnis, told me to do  that. He told me to lie. It wouldn't be good for my free agency to say  there's certain places I don't want to go to.\"McKinnis shot back soon thereafter, saying it would have made no sense to tell Gray to lie about wanting to play for the Yankees. Here's what McKinnis told The Athletic:\"So, Brian is trying to make people believe I told Sonny to, in  Cashman's words, 'lie' to the minor-league video guy to try to get Sonny  to the Yankees -- even though, per Cashman, Sonny did not want to be  with the Yankees -- to subsequently somehow help Sonny's free agency.  This makes zero sense. … Further, the words, 'I want out of Oakland,'  have never been said by Sonny. He loved his time with the A's.\"There's definitely some he said, she said going on here. What's clear though is Gray did not like playing in New York and he told Cashman. It was a perhaps a little late -- Gray should have mentioned it before the 2018 trade deadline and not after -- but what's done is done. The Yankees traded Gray to the Reds in January 2019.Some players don't like playing in New York or big markets in general and that's fine. It's not for everyone. Teams can do as much homework as they want, but until you put a player in that environment, you just never know how they'll react. If nothing else, Gray's admitted hatred of New York will add some juice to a Yankees/Red Sox rivalry that is starting to perk back up a bit.\nNow 36, Gray had a 4.51 ERA with the Yankees in 2017 and 2018. He has a career 3.58 ERA, and a 3.51 ERA since the Yankees traded him away. That includes a second place finish in the 2023 AL Cy Young voting with the Twins.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Trey Hendrickson has been sidelined since Week 8, and the Cincinnati Bengals are not expected to see their star pass rusher for the rest of the 2025 campaign. Hendrickson recently underwent core muscle surgery, according to NFL Media, and is looking at a recovery window of about six weeks. With four weeks remaining in the regular season and Cincinnati all but out of the playoff picture at 4-9, it's curtains for Hendrickson.   While the headline stemming from this news item centers around Hendrickson being done for the year, it may also mean he's played his final snap for the Bengals. The 31-year-old is slated to become an unrestricted free agent this coming offseason, which puts his future in Cincinnati in doubt. That's especially true when factoring in the soap opera the two sides have been entangled in over the previous few years, which included multiple trade requests. Back in 2024, Hendrickson's trade request was ultimately not granted. However, this past offseason, the pass rusher was allowed to seek a deal that would ship him out of Cincinnati, but nothing came to pass. During training camp, Hendrickson was a hold-in until he agreed to a restructured contract for the 2025 season, but no more years were added onto the deal. Given that the Bengals have been reluctant to extend Hendrickson, it seems like he could very likely hit the open market. But where will he end up? Let's identify a handful of potential landing spots.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe Colts are still grappling with the loss of Daniel Jones (Achilles) for the season, so it may be difficult to envision an offseason addition. However, this is a roster that is ready to compete now. While they have to address quarterback in some capacity (Jones himself is set to be a free agent), they could stand to add a pass rusher as well. Entering Week 15, Indy ranks 23rd in the NFL in pressure rate (33.5%) and 18th in sack rate (6.7%). The Colts are currently projected to have about $47.5 million in available cap space this offseason, and some of those funds could be utilized toward bringing in Hendrickson, who has a relationship with current defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo (former DC of the Bengals).  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersThe Raiders are a weird team to try to project for 2026. On the one hand, this season has been a disaster as the Geno Smith and Pete Carroll experiment has blown up in their face, coming into the final month of the year already eliminated from the playoffs at 2-11. That said, there are still pieces to like on the roster, which includes Brock Bowers and Ashton Jeanty on offense and, of course, Maxx Crosby on defense. Adding Hendrickson to pair opposite of Crosby would create one of the top pass-rushing duos in the league if both are healthy. While the Raiders need to figure out what they want to do at quarterback next season, they have money to burn as they are projected to have roughly $107.1 million in available space (via Over the Cap), which is second-most in the NFL. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington CommandersThe 2025 season has been a nightmare for Washington. After going to the NFC Championship during Year 1 of the Jayden Daniels era, the organization was hit hard by injuries. Daniels missed multiple games, as did top wideout Terry McLaurin. While that hampered the offense, the defense struggled mightily. Entering Week 15, Washington is giving up 6.2 yards per play (31st in the NFL) and 27.2 points per game (28th). The unit's pressure rate (19th) and sack rate (15th) are also pedestrian, so adding someone who can disrupt the quarterback like Hendrickson could go a long way for Dan Quinn's defense. The Commanders also have plenty of money to help fix that side of the ball, possessing $81.9 million in available space this offseason (fifth-most in the NFL). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore RavensThe Baltimore Ravens have recorded just 19 sacks on the season entering Week 15, which has them ranked 30th in the NFL. Meanwhile, their sack rate is even worse, coming in at 31st in the league (3.9%) while their 30.4% pressure rate clocks in a 29th. Needless to say, they could use a pass rusher and will have the capital to target someone like Hendrickson, who also fits their timeline to compete right away. Baltimore is projected to have a little over $40 million in cap space this offseason. On top of this, addressing a key need for the Ravens, it would also be a great heel turn for Hendrickson by staying in the AFC North and squaring off against his former Bengals team twice a year. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas CowboysThe Cowboys will need to do some salary cap gymnastics in order to make this work. At the moment, Dallas is slated to be $47.9 million over the salary cap, so Jerry Jones will need to get his books in order before free agency rolls around. Putting those financial hurdles over to the side, however, it's a fascinating fit. The Cowboys reportedly checked in on possibly acquiring Hendrickson leading up to the 2025 trade deadline, but no deal came across the wire. If the club had interest before, it very well could be interested in him again, especially since it doesn't cost any draft capital to bring him in. Hendrickson would help fill the shoes of Micah Parsons off the edge and continue to boost a Dallas defensive line that did bring in Quinnen Williams at the deadline. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Phillies are signing the top power hitter on the free-agent market. Slugger Kyle Schwarber and the Phillies have agreed to a five-year, $150 million free agent contract, CBS Sports has confirmed. That $30 million AAV is a record for a DH. The club has not yet announced the signing. Schwarber, who turns 33 in early March, is coming off a career year with the Phillies in which he hit an NL-leading 56 home runs and drew 102 unintentional walks. Along the way, he put up an OPS+ of 150 and came in second place in the National League MVP race behind Shohei Ohtani. Coming into the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Schwarber as the No. 5 available free agent in the 2025-26 class. Here's part of our write-up: All Schwarber does is hit. The catch is, well, all Schwarber does is hit. He has negative defensive and positional value, and the obvious comparisons to David Ortiz miss a key consideration: Ortiz didn't have extreme swing-and-miss tendencies. It's reasonable to wonder if Schwarber will age as gracefully as Ortiz did. Those questions may impact the term (Ortiz himself maxed out at four years around this part of his career), but there's no doubting Schwarber's ability to make an immediate impact. He has both the high-end bat speed and elite plate discipline to regularly perform 30% or better than the league-average hitter. Those traits ought to hold for at least a few more years, making him one of the top free agents in this class.For his career, Schwarber has a WAR of 19.9 across parts of 11 MLB seasons. He's a three-time All-Star and he'll enter the 2026 season with 340 career home runs to his credit. Here are three other things to know about the deal.1. Agreement made sense for both partiesThis was always the most logical conclusion for both parties. Philadelphia's front office wasn't going to find a better pure hitter available on a five-year term. Yes, in theory, the Phillies could've chased after Kyle Tucker instead, but he would've required a much bigger commitment. Other potential alternatives, like free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, would've required a larger reshaping of the roster than the Phillies may feel comfortable with at this point.\nSchwarber, meanwhile, wasn't as clean of a fit for some of the other teams pursuing him. The Mets, for instance, would've had to contend with employing him and Juan Soto for the next five years. Besides, Schwarber seems to enjoy being part of the Phillies, to the extent that both sides had publicly expressed their desire to continue this relationship.\nAn agreement may have taken until the Winter Meetings to reach, but now Schwarber can rest easy knowing that his ultimate goal -- bringing a World Series title to Philadelphia -- remains in play.2. Phillies have other business to attend toWith Schwarber taken care of, the Phillies can now turn their attention elsewhere. That means, among other items on their to-do list, figuring out whether or not a reunion is in the cards with free-agent backstop J.T. Realmuto. \nRealmuto, 35 come March, is the top available backstop despite age-related decline. His 91 OPS+ last season represented his worst mark of his career. Nonetheless, the market lacks a compelling alternative, suggesting the Phillies will maintain their interest in bringing him back. (Conversely, the Phillies do not appear to have interest in retaining lefty Ranger Suárez.)\nElsewhere on the roster, the Phillies are known to be shopping veteran outfielder Nick Castellanos. He's fresh off a career-worst season, during which he openly criticized manager Rob Thomson. 3. Hitter market should start movingThe idea that Schwarber's signing will serve as the first domino in a series of moves has grown into an accepted theory. There's some logic to it: he was a popular target for both the game's highest rollers, including the Phillies, Mets, and Red Sox, and more reserved spenders, like the Pirates and Reds. With Schwarber spoken for, those other teams can move on to their respective backup plans -- be it in the form of other free agents or through trades.\nWhether or not that's an instant development that leads to a more eventful second half of the Winter Meetings is to be seen. At minimum, teams now have one fewer excuse to blame their inactivity on.\n            ",

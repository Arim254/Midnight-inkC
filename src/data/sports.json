L.A. has allowed both the second-fewest rushing yards and rushing touchdowns, in addition to the team ranking third in total defense and fourth in third-down defense. On the other side of the ball, the Chargers are coming off 192 yards on the ground and a season-high of two rushing touchdowns last week, as they'll get to face a Philly defense that ranks in the bottom 10 in both rushing yards allowed and rushing average given up. See which team to back at SportsLine. Check out the latest BetMGM promo code CBSSPORTS, where new users can get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses.How to make Eagles vs. Chargers       picksFor Chargers vs. Eagles  on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 43 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs spent the better part of a decade treating the AFC playoff race as a formality. This year, it became a weekly math problem, and the numbers don't lie. Sunday night's 20-10 loss to the Houston Texans dropped Kansas City to 6-7, pushing the franchise into unfamiliar territory: 10th place in the AFC with four games remaining and below .500 in December for the first time since 2012. The defeat also ended the Chiefs' run of nine straight AFC West titles. PPatrick Mahomes didn't hide the reality of the moment.\"We know the (playoff) chances are getting lower and lower, but I know the guys on this team are going to give everything they have, every opportunity we get,\" Mahomes said. Kansas City's night unraveled in familiar fashion. Drives stalled, chances slipped away and the Chiefs' offense never found a rhythm. Mahomes finished with just 160 passing yards on 14-of-33 throwing with three picks -- a stat line shaped as much by his own miscues as by the help he never received. The Chiefs dropped six passes, including one from Travis Kelce in the fourth quarter that deflected into the arms of Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, and another from Rashee Rice on a must-have fourth-and-4.The protection issues were just as damaging. Kansas City entered the game already patching together an offensive line with three starters unavailable, then lost tackle Wanya Morris on the first snap. On the other side of the ball, cornerback Trent McDuffie exited after suffering a knee injury following a 46-yard completion to Nico Collins. With the lineup thinning, Houston consistently collapsed the pocket, pressuring Mahomes on roughly half of his dropbacks and contributing to what became the lowest passer rating of his career.\n\"They are upset,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"They put it all out there and it didn't work out for them. The guys that had some mishaps, they [are] upset. These guys take responsibility for things.\"Mahomes has never missed the NFL postseason.\"I know we're not winning games, but that mindset the guys have in this locker room, in the games that we're not winning, you can never question the fight of this team,\" Mahomes said. \"Obviously, we're not executing at the right moments and we're not making those plays, but at the end of the day you can never question that, and I think you'll see that for these last four weeks.\"Kansas City's path back to the playoffs is narrow, but not impossible. The Chiefs close the season with home games against AFC West rivals Denver Broncos (11-2) and Los Angeles Chargers (8-4), and road contests against struggling Tennessee Titans (2-11) and Las Vegas Raiders (2-11).\nTo keep their postseason chances alive, they will need to win out and hope the Wild Card teams ahead of them stumble.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A cross-conference NFL Week 14 matchup has the Los Angeles Chargers hosting the Philadelphia Eagles on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. A MNF SGP could consist of NFL picks on the money line, and the Chargers have won five of their last six home games versus the Eagles. Philadelphia is a 2.5-point favorite, per the latest NFL odds, with spread picks also being popular bets to include in NFL same-game parlays. Many will also go the route of including prop picks, with the likes of Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, Keenan Allen and Ladd McConkey top players to target.Hurts and Barkley both share the same NFL prop odds as an anytime touchdown scorer at +105. Neither found the end zone last week, however, while the potentially returning Omarion Hampton (+170) has the shortest odds to score amongst Chargers. Adding a plus-money NFL prop like this could result in a huge payday on your MNF same-game parlay.

Brown goes Under 60.5 receiving yards (-114). With Philly's offensive struggles, Brown is having the worst season of his career as his 63.5 receiving yards per game are the lowest of his seven NFL seasons. While he's found success against poor teams, that hasn't been the case against the league's better squads. Brown hasn't even reached 50 receiving yards in four of his last five versus teams that currently have winning records.The 8-4 Chargers fit the bill, and they will be the best pass defense that the Eagles have seen all year. L.A. ranks second versus the pass as it is built to prevent big days from wide receivers. Only one wideout has had more than 46 receiving yards versus the Chargers over the last four games. Brown is projected to have 52.2 receiving yards on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here, and bet this prop here:How to make Eagles vs. Chargers SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has two other NFL props that are rated 4.5 stars or better that could be a part of your Chargers vs. Eagles SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Eagles vs. Chargers predictions?

    "body": "\n        In reality, the 2025-26 college football transfer portal cycle is already in full motion even if the new, single window (Jan. 2-16) is weeks away. Teams have been building portal boards for months, players are announcing their intentions to enter by the hundreds, and, as one agent put it, \"deals are being struck.\"Quarterback, as always, will draw the headlines. Industry sources expect there to be a robust quarterback market of established starters, high-profile backups, non-Power Four stars and even a few FCS quarterbacks with whom schools are enamored. The money will be tremendous; schools are still operating without any regard for a cap. These are the names that other programs are keeping their eyes on, in talking with sources across the country:LaNorris Sellers, South Carolina: In some ways Sellers is one of the the swing players of this quarterback cycle. The Gamecocks have a lot of work to do to keep Sellers in Columbia; he could also go pro, but that seems unlikely after a rough 2025 season in which he entered atop many a draft board. Nothing has been decided about his future, but Sellers could be the biggest splash of this transfer quarterback cycle if he were to leave South Carolina. The Gamecocks ponied up to keep Sellers in the fold this past offseason, but his next decision will be about charting the best course for his long-term future. Sellers' camp would need to feel confident in whoever the school hires as its offensive coordinator and the supporting cast around him. \nSam Leavitt, Arizona State: A name that's already broken contain, industry sources point to Leavitt as someone who could explore the transfer portal. Nothing has been decided in that regard, however, as there are a lot of decisions to be made around Tempe that will help determine Leavitt's future.Dylan Raiola, Nebraska: As CBS Sports previously reported, there's some concern in Lincoln about Raiola's future with the program. Those in Raiola's camp strongly considered the portal last offseason, and that's the case again ahead of the winter portal window.\n        \n            \n                Nebraska preparing for possibility QB Dylan Raiola enters transfer portal\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAidan Chiles, Michigan State: Chiles was benched earlier this season by the old Michigan State staff. It's unclear how new coach Pat Fitzgerald's hire will impact his thinking. But Chiles has been a popular name among industry sources, in terms of potential portal players.\nCJ Bailey, NC State: Bailey quietly emerged as one of the country's best passers this past season, throwing for 2,884 yards and 23 touchdowns while completing 69.6% of his passes. Industry sources have speculated for months now that the Miami native could test the portal waters, though Dave Doeren's return could help keep the NC State roster together.Brendan Sorsby, Cincinnati: You can put Sorsby in the same bucket as Sellers as a quarterback with a pair of decisions to make. He needs to decide whether he'll test the NFL Draft waters. He also needs to decide if he comes back to college whether that will be with Cincinnati. Other schools have pointed at Sorsby as a player they're watching closely.Drew Mestemaker, North Texas: There's a Group of Five quarterback who moves every year and ends up defining the cycle. That could be Mestermaker in 2026. Most in the industry believe that he'll just follow North Texas coach Eric Morris to Oklahoma State. But Mestemaker is someone who will draw considerable national interest.\nByrum Brown, QB, South Florida: Brown is a guy to keep an eye on this upcoming cycle. He's a listed senior but there's a good chance he can get another year. If he does ... Auburn would be a natural landing spot. That's where his old coach, Alex Golesh, left South Florida for. That's only a few of the many names that are being thrown out behind the scenes. There are key backups at places like Ohio State (Lincoln Kienholz) and Notre Dame (Kenny Minchey) with decisions to make. There are some interesting non-Power Four quarterbacks out there like Colton Joseph at Old Dominion -- he's expected to have high-level options -- and even a few in the FCS worth keeping an eye on like Harvard's Jaden Craig, who people speculate could move.\nThere are also a bunch of other established starters who will dip into the market, depending on offensive coordinator and rev-share negotiations.Buckle up.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On January 1, 1902, Michigan and Stanford met in the Tournament East-West Game. The game, which Michigan won 49-0, was the first of its kind: a postseason invitational game between two schools that played in different leagues. In other words, it was a bowl game. It was the first of its kind, and also the last of its kind, until 1916, when the game became an annual event. It's now a tradition that has carried on for over 100 years. The Tournament East-West Game continues too. It changed its name to The Rose Bowl in 1923.Bowls have been around nearly as long as the sport of college football itself, but it seems their time is nearing an end. It wasn't long ago when players began opting out of bowl games to preserve their health and future value as athletes, but the first ones to do it were the players likely to be high draft picks. Then the mid-round players joined in.Now teams are doing it. Kansas State and Iowa State received $500,000 fines from the Big 12 for opting out of bowl games this year. Both teams felt that, in the wake of losing their coaches and transitioning to new leadership, they had better ways to spend their time than preparing for a bowl game with a makeshift coaching staff and a roster full of players uncertain about what their futures held for them at the college level.Then Notre Dame joined in on the fun. The Fighting Irish, caught up in their feelings over being left out of the College Football Playoff, made the decision to end their season altogether. They took on the posture of righteous indignation, but who among us hasn't been guilty of telling themselves anything they have to in order to justify their feelings?\n\n        \n            \n                Ranking all 41 college football bowl games for 2025-26: Cotton, Rose offer CFP buzz, Pinstripe spikes rest\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRegardless of the motivation or how anybody feels about it, what matters is the precedent set by the schools. The first player to opt out of a game let other players know it was OK to do so, and more followed suit. More programs will too.Now, to be clear, this won't become the norm. I don't think we'll see a bunch of bowl-eligible teams opting out in the coming years, at least not the 10-2 ones. It will mostly be teams dealing with changes in leadership, but the more teams that skip out on bowls, the more we'll realize how little the bowls matter now. For many college football fans, bowls have always been part of the experience. Events as fundamental to the sport as bands playing fight songs, tailgates and rivalry trophies. But most of those traditions have been warped and chipped away at by the College Football Playoff. The desire to maximize revenue and create an enticing product has destroyed the conferences most of those same fans grew up with. Bowls are no different. The College Football Playoff has damaged the value of the bowl games more than players opting out of them ever could.\nBowls had already begun to lose some of their best available options to the playoff when it expanded to 12 teams. That's eight more teams they no longer got to choose from for their games. Tack on more schools opting out of games, and the pool of available teams becomes even thinner, which makes the games less attractive as television properties, which makes people sitting in boardrooms begin wondering if there are better ways to fill those blocs of television.Maybe they can put on a rankings show instead? It'll be great. They can rank teams in any order they choose and then come up with arbitrary reasons why they did so. Then, later in the show, they can just change them. Think of the engagement it could get on social media!Anyway, a further threat to the bowls is the unending specter of further playoff expansion. Nobody believes the playoff will remain at 12 teams, and the \"controversy\" around this year's playoff field will only lead to louder cries for expansion. Because if there's anything we've learned about college football's postseason, it's that putting more teams in the playoff fixes all the problems. Once they take that bad boy to 16 teams, that's four fewer teams available. And that's assuming they stop at 16. Let's not forget there have been 24-team proposals floated in recent months, too.\nWhen the playoff does expand, how many of its new games will be played at neutral sites? You think the teams that earn byes in the current format don't look at the teams who get to host first-round playoff games and think about how nice it would be to have that money too? The future of the College Football Playoff doesn't include more teams, but more games played on campus, too, because everybody will want a taste of the action. This is a good thing. Playoff games on campus make for an incredible environment, and incredible environments make for awesome television.But it won't be nearly as awesome for the bowls. At least, not the ones who aren't part of the rotation as host sites in the later rounds of the new playoff. So, if you're a fan of bowl games, enjoy them while you can. They won't be around too much longer.\n            ",

While Jones was able to limp on his own to the locker room, the Colts were quick to rule him out.Check out what happened here:\nJones, 28, had been one of the NFL's most remarkable comeback stories this season as the Colts got off to a 7-1 start. However, they have lost four out of their last five, with Jones throwing five interceptions in that span.Who the Colts will move forward with at quarterback is a legitimate question. The rookie Riley Leonard replaced Jones under center on Sunday, and completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and one interception while adding a touchdown on the ground. Then there's Anthony Richardson, the former No. 4 overall pick who is currently on injured reserve after he suffered an orbital fracture during pregame warmups in mid-October. He lost the quarterback battle with Jones this preseason, and has an 8-7 record as starter for Indy.\nThe Colts were once viewed as the best team in the NFL, but at 8-5, it's no longer a given that they will even make the playoffs. Indy gave up control of the AFC South with its loss to Jacksonville on Sunday, and have one of the toughest remaining schedules in the NFL:WeekOpponentWeek 15at Seattle SeahawksWeek 16vs. San Francisco 49ersWeek 17vs. Jacksonville JaguarsWeek 18at Houston Texans\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Contemporary Baseball Era Committee has elected Jeff Kent into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, museum president Josh Rawitch announced Sunday at the Winter Meetings in Orlando.Kent was named on 14 of 16 ballots. Twelve votes are needed for induction. Others on the ballot this year were Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Carlos Delgado, Don Mattingly, Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield and Fernando Valenzuela. As a reminder, there are two separate Hall of Fame votes each offseason and the one that generally comes to the forefront is the BBWAA vote. This Contemporary Era Hall of Fame vote is tantamount to a second chance for players who have lapsed off the BBWAA ballot. A 16-person panel met in person to discuss the merits of eight candidates before casting their ballots. The panel: \nHall of Famers Fergie Jenkins, Jim Kaat, Juan Marichal, Tony Perez, Ozzie Smith, Alan Trammell, Robin YountExecutives Mark Attanasio, Doug Melvin, Arte Moreno, Kim Ng, Tony Reagins, Terry Ryan Media/historians Steve Hirdt, Tyler Kepner, Jayson StarkKent, 57, hit .290/.356/.500 (123 OPS+) in parts of 17 seasons along with 2,461 hits, 560 doubles, 377 home runs, 1,518 RBI, 1,320 runs and 55.4 WAR. He's the all-time leader in home runs by a second baseman. Kent played for the Giants for six seasons and amassed most of his career value there (31.6 WAR with San Francisco, while he didn't get more than 8.4 WAR with any other team). Kent hinted Sunday that he'd like to go in with a Giants logo on his plaque cap, citing his \"great moments in the Bay Area with those fans.\" It's also possible that the Hall will go with a blank logo, as he spent five years with the Mets, four with the Dodgers, two with the Astros, one with the Blue Jays and one with Cleveland.A five-time All-Star and four-time Silver Slugger, Kent won the National League MVP in 2000. \nIn 10 years on the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot, Kent never got higher than 46.5% of the vote. He was the victim of a crowded ballot and probably punished far too heavily for being a so-called one-dimensional player. He was one of the best hitting second baseman of all time, but defensive and baserunning metrics weren't kind to him and dragged down all-encompassing metrics like WAR. Speaking of, Kent ranks 19th in WAR among second basemen in baseball history and he's now the 21st Hall of Famer at the position. As noted, he's first in home runs at the position and ranks third among second basemen in RBI. He's also 12th in runs and 13th in hits.Kent will be inducted into the Hall  in July in Cooperstown, alongside the winners of the BBWAA vote that  will be announced in January. Among the candidates on the BBWAA's ballot are newcomers Ryan Braun and Cole Hamels, as well as holdovers like Carlos Beltrán, Andruw Jones, Alex Rodriguez, and more.\nBonds, Kent's former teammate, and Clemens both received fewer than five votes and, according to a new rule, they are now ineligible to appear on the next Contemporary Baseball Era Committee ballot in December 2028. The earliest they can appear on the ballot again is in December 2031. If they receive fewer than five votes again, they will no longer be eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. Sheffield and Valenzuela also got fewer than five votes. Murphy and Mattingly got six votes each while Delgado got nine.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There is a new No. 1 overall as the Giants claimed the top spot while on a bye. The Saints and Titans were victorious this week, which led to them slipping down the draft order. The Browns were a direct beneficiary in the loss to Tennessee. Eight teams have three wins or fewer on the year. Looking forward to Week 15, Commanders at Giants is the game expected to have the greatest impact on the 2026 NFL Draft order.As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon) as well as potential team needs:\n1. New York Giants (2-11)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTNew York is on a Bye this week, so there were not any NFL Draft stakes on the line. 2. Las Vegas Raiders (2-11)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas kept it close in the first half, but slowly bled out over the course of the evening. 3. Tennessee Titans (2-11)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEIn a battle of top-5 overall projected teams, Tennessee emerged victorious over Cleveland with the snow falling. \n4. Cleveland Browns (3-10)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland made a valiant effort at a comeback down two scores to the Titans, but poorly executed a two-point conversion. 5. New Orleans Saints (3-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRTyler Shough was far from perfect as a passer, but showed a lot of toughness and determination on his two rushing touchdowns. The rookie has given New Orleans some reason for optimism. 6. Washington Commanders (3-10)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington went down without as much as a whimper Sunday versus the struggling Vikings. Jayden Daniels returned to the lineup, but did not solve the team's offensive issues. \n7. New York Jets (3-10)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEThe Jets lost seven straight games to open the season, but have shown some life over the past five games. The team was on life support Sunday, however, as the game against Miami was never really competitive. 8. Arizona Cardinals (3-10)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBThe Cardinals are limping to the finish line with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. Arizona has a decision to make at quarterback this offseason. 9. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (4-9)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta's first-round pick continues to climb, which only benefits the Rams. Los Angeles is looking at a situation where they could theoretically make a play for the heir apparent to Matthew Stafford while simultaneously contending for the NFC. \n10. Cincinnati Bengals (4-9)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Burrow returned from injury in hopes of keeping the team's playoff chances alive, but the dream may be dead with this week's loss to Buffalo. 11. Minnesota Vikings (5-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBJ.J. McCarthy managed the game just as he had done at Michigan. He was not the driving force on offense, but he avoided the critical errors that he had been accumulating in recent weeks. Minnesota put an end to a four-game losing streak. 12. Miami Dolphins (6-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami's rebound has been one of the most improbable stories of the season. The Dolphins have won five of their past six games to force their way back into the AFC Playoff picture. \n13. Baltimore Ravens (6-7)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBThe AFC North is typically a competitive division with multiple playoff representatives. In 2025, it is trending toward only the division winner emerging.14. Kansas City Chiefs (6-7)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEKansas City's playoff hopes took a massive hit with their home loss to the surging Texans. 15. Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas' three-game win streak came to an abrupt end Thursday night against a desperate Lions team. The Cowboys are exactly .500 with four games to play.\n16. Carolina Panthers (7-6)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina is tied atop the NFC South after the Buccaneers' loss to the Saints. The two teams play each other twice over the final four weeks.17. Detroit Lions (8-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit knocked off Dallas on Thursday night to keep its NFC North chances alive. \\18. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-5)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLJacksonville took a commanding lead in the division as the Colts continue reeling from Daniel Jones' injury. The real winner is the Jets, who acquired Indianapolis' first-round pick as part of the Sauce Gardner deal. \n19. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLPittsburgh has taken over sole possession of first place in the AFC North after hanging on to beat the Ravens on Sunday.20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe Buccaneers continue on their downward spiral, as the team has now lost four of their past five games. The division is very much attainable with three games remaining against the Falcons and Panthers. 21. Houston Texans (8-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SThe red-hot Texans traveled to Kansas City and knocked off Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n22. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLThe Chargers host Philadelphia on \"Sunday Night Football.\"23. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia won four games to open the season, then lost two games, then won four straight, and is now on a two-game losing streak. Will a new win streak begin against the Chargers on \"Monday Night Football\"?24. Chicago Bears (9-4)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTChicago battled back from a two-score deficit against Green Bay, but it was too little, too late in the end. 25. Buffalo Bills (9-4)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRIt was a classic Joe-Burrow vs. Josh Allen showdown Sunday in Buffalo. The Bills keep pace in the AFC East. \n26. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TESan Francisco rides a three-game win streak into its bye before returning in Week 15 against the Titans.27. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland is not going to get a top-half-of-the-round pick from Jacksonville. The Jaguars have a firm grip on the divisional lead; the Browns will have to wait to learn where they will be picking.28. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBGreen Bay was able to fend off Chicago not only in Sunday's game, but also the NFC North divisional race. The two teams will meet again before the end of the season. 29. Seattle Seahawks (10-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRAtlanta served as a thorn in the side of Seattle in the first half, but the Seahawks pulled away for a decisive win.30. New England Patriots (11-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEDrake Maye has yet to throw for 300 yards in a game, but the Patriots will carry the league's best record for at least one more week.31. Los Angeles Rams (10-3)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLSeattle and Los Angeles are deadlocked in the NFL's most competitive division.

    "body": "\n        Kansas freshman guard Darryn Peterson, the possible No. 1 pick in June's 2026 NBA Draft, returned to the lineup for the first time after missing his team's last seven games due to a hamstring injury. Peterson logged 23 minutes and recorded 17 points, three rebounds and an assist in an 80-60 win over Missouri on Sunday.\"I thought he did fine,\" Kansas coach Bill Self told reporters after the win. \"I didn't think he pushed it. That's not because of his (hamstring), that's because he's sick. I was nervous he wasn't going to play. ... I thought he did fine, but I didn't plan on playing him 17 and a half minutes the first half. I wanted to play about 14, and then when he got however many he got to start the second half, he was gassed. If it had been a close game, it may have been different, but I wasn't going to try to play him over 27 anyway.\"\nPeterson, one of the most highly touted guard prospects to come out of the high school ranks in years, made his collegiate debut against Green Bay last month, finishing with 21 points, four rebounds and three assists. Against North Carolina on the road, Peterson scored 22 points in a 87-74 loss.Self told reporters last month that Peterson's hamstring issue had been lingering for \"weeks,\" but he played through it in the early part of the season. Notably, Peterson didn't finish an exhibition game against Louisville due to a cramping issue and also exited the second half against Green Bay due to cramps.\n        \n            \n                Tomorrow's Top 25 Today: Michigan expected to be No. 1 in college basketball rankings; Arizona, Duke make case\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhat makes Darryn Peterson an elite NBA prospect?Peterson started to create some separation among his peers to become the NBA's No. 1 overall pick in the summer. However, if you ask 10 people who follow the draft closely to predict the first three picks in the draft, you might get 10 different answers. While the top pick has been dominated by forwards, wings and bigs in recent years, Peterson has a chance to become the exception.\nIn CBS Sports' NBA Draft prospect rankings by Adam Finkelstein, Peterson was ranked No. 1, ahead of BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Duke's Cameron Boozer -- both of whom are wings/forwards at the NBA level.He finished as the top-ranked prospect in last year's recruiting class and begins this draft cycle in the same place. Peterson is a big, playmaking guard who continues to improve each year. His overlap of positional size, length, strength and shot creation is unmatched in this class. In fact, he may be the best domestic guard we've seen in several draft cycles. If the shot-making we've seen early on at Kansas proves sustainable, he could be even better than expected. The last guard taken with the No. 1 pick was Cade Cunningham in 2021. Since 2010, only six prospects who have gone No. 1 have been classified as a guard. Although Cooper Flagg has been utilized as a point guard through the first few weeks his NBA career by the Dallas Mavericks, he is a traditional wing at the NBA level.Part of the intrigue around Peterson is his potential to be a volume scorer at the NBA level. Peterson is also a talented defensive prospect who can defend at a high level because of his size and athleticism. But what stands out the most -- and why he may ultimately go No. 1 -- is his shot making that is second to none in this class. \nPeterson has all the makings to be an elite scorer at the next level.\n            ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nGood morning, everyone! Carter Bahns here with you on the heels of a monumental weekend in the football universe. We have a College Football Playoff bracket, and I'm sure a good number of you are less than thrilled about the way it came together. We'll discuss all the controversy on the bubble while also spinning things forward and taking a look at which teams could win the whole thing. There are also a bunch of NFL storylines to hit before we move on with our mornings, too. Week 14 was pivotal for numerous division races and gave us a couple of thrillers. (Thank you, Bills and Bengals.) Let's dive in.  \t🏆 Five things to know Monday The College Football Playoff bracket is here! And it's not without heavy controversy. Conference championship games on set the stage for Sunday's CFP bracket reveal. Indiana secured the No. 1 seed by way of its Big Ten title, Georgia is in at No. 3 after winning the SEC and Texas Tech is the No. 4 seed as the Big 12's lone representative. The biggest surprise is that Miami leaped past Notre Dame in the final rankings to punch a ticket as the last at-large participant. This will also be the first playoff with two Group of Five teams as both Tulane (No. 11) and James Madison (No. 12) clinched spots in the field.Division contenders dueled in the NFL's biggest showdowns of Week 14. The top two teams in three divisions -- AFC North, AFC South and NFC North -- played against each other in games with colossal postseason implications. The Steelers took control of their division with a 27-22 road win over the Ravens, the Jaguars notched a decisive 36-19 victory over the Colts to build a one-game lead and the Packers fended off the Bears in a 28-21 battle that came down to the final seconds. There's a lot to make sense of, so we put the results, latest playoff picture and reshaped draft order all in one place.Penn State finally found its next coach in another busy weekend on the carousel. Welcome to the Big Ten, Matt Campbell. After whiffing on countless candidates, Penn State brought its search to a close by hiring the longtime Iowa State coach. The process was a nightmare for the Nittany Lions, but they might have found the perfect hire in the end. Iowa State quickly identified its replacement and hired Jimmy Rogers away from Washington State the same day Campbell left for State College. The Big Ten also officially welcomed Bob Chesney to UCLA, and in the wake of that move, James Madison announced Billy Napier as its next headman.The United States men's national team secured a favorable group in the FIFA World Cup draw. Each of the 12 groups for the 2026 World Cup are set, although the 48-team entire field will not be finalized until the end of the UEFA and Intercontinental Playoffs. USMNT stand as winners from the draw as they avoided the biggest threats and will see Australia, Paraguay and a to-be-determined UEFA team in Group D. Mexico, also one of the three host countries, has a favorable road to the knockout stage, too. Which teams will come to your city? When and where will the Americans play? Take a look at the full schedule.Lionel Messi is an MLS champion. The 38-year-old soccer legend recorded two assists to aid Inter Miami CF in a 3-1 victory over Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the MLS Cup Final. Messi won the MLS Cup MVP award for his efforts and put the finishing touches on a tremendous playoff run in which he racked up six goals and nine assists, which includes secondary assists. The Herons are league champions for the first time and could be the club to beat in years to come with their loads of star power. ☘️ Do not miss this: CFP bracket analysis, reaction to Notre Dame's snub \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            None of the teams on the outside of the CFP looking in were thrilled with the outcome, but nobody is more upset than Notre Dame. Despite entering championship weekend in position for a berth, the Fighting Irish found themselves snubbed from a spot in the bracket after the selection committee moved Miami ahead of them. \nThe Fighting Irish case was clear. A dominant 10-game winning streak and zero losses to teams outside the top 10 gave them a competitive résumé. Committee chair Hunter Yurachek said that it was the head-to-head loss to Miami that cost Notre Dame a spot in the field, but why did that not factor into previous iterations of the CFP Top 25? That inconsistency in logic led Notre Dame athletic director Pete Bevacqua to criticize the committee over the \"stolen\" bid. And that wasn't the only response from South Bend: The school withdrew itself from consideration from all of the season's bowl games. Outside of the stunner at the bottom of the bracket, the rest of the selection process went mostly according to expectations. The only other major point of contention was the decision to include Alabama as the first three-loss team in CFP history. Now that the field is set, here are the five likeliest teams to win the national championship, per FanDuel: Ohio State: +250Indiana: +260Georgia: +550Texas Tech: +850Oregon: +850 🏈 NFL Week 14 takeaways: From a Green Bay rivalry win to Daniel Jones' brutal injury \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The Ravens could legitimately miss the playoffs. The Bengals are just about out of the picture, too. Those are two of Tyler Sullivan's biggest takeaways from a week in which the NFL's contenders separated themselves from the pretenders. Here's everything else you need to know: \nWinners: Victory tastes even sweeter when it comes against a rival and builds separation at the top of the division, so the Packers are undoubtedly among the week's biggest winners. Mike Tomlin also came out on top. One week after some Steelers fans called for his job, he delivered a win over the Ravens that put Pittsburgh in sole possession of a divisional lead. Josh Allen's MVP hopes also got a boost when he scored four touchdowns and sparked a comeback effort to beat the Bengals. J.J. McCarthy is a winner, too, for completing his first game without an interception in a 31-0 rout of the Commanders.Losers: Few teams want to forget Week 14 more than the Colts. They received a \"D\" grade on our weekly report card after suffering their 11th consecutive road loss to the Jaguars. Despite their 8-2 start, they are suddenly in danger of missing the playoffs as they carry a three-game losing streak and could be without Daniel Jones for the rest of the year. The Buccaneers also suffered a gruesome loss and now stand just one game over .500 after dropping a 24-20 egg against the three-win Saints. The Chiefs' chance of making the playoffs has plummeted into the mid teens, even lower than Sunday night's temperature in Kansas City, where they were defeated by the surging Texans, 20-10. Injuries: Daniel Jones, who was already playing through a fractured left fibula, is now out of the remainder of the season left torn right Achilles tendon. In addition to the Colts' injury, the Commanders lost two key players as Jayden Daniels left Washington's shutout defeat after reinjuring his elbow and Zach Ertz sustained an apparent serious leg injury. The Dolphins were also without De'Von Achane for most of their win over the Jets due to a rib injury.Clinchers: The Commanders, Falcons, Jets and Browns are eliminated from playoff contention. 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            College football bowl matchups are set.

    "body": "\n        In Week 14, several players jumped on the Fantasy Football radar. This could be the start of something special for some of these players, and you'll want to get well ahead of your Week 15 Fantasy Football waiver wire by putting these players on your radar. For more on every player we discuss below, you'll want to make sure to check out Jamey Eisenberg's in-depth waiver wire column on Monday afternoon.Shedeur Sanders, QB, BrownsSanders has found his way onto the NFL radar and more importantly the Fantasy radar with an explosive Week 14 performance against the Titans. Only Josh Allen scored more Fantasy points than Sanders in Week 14. The rookie Browns quarterback nearly racked up 40 Fantasy points (38) with 364 yards passing and three touchdowns. He added a fourth touchdown on the ground where he also added 29 yards. If Sanders continues to find success in the screen game, on vertical passes and as a scrambler in the red zone, he could make his way onto the Fantasy radar this playoffs. Tony Pollard, RB, TitansThe Titans may have found something on the offensive side of the ball by leaning on Pollard in the run game. Against a stingy Browns run defense that has stopped almost every back it's faced, Pollard ripped off 161 yards rushing and two touchdowns. Perhaps more importantly, he obliterated any timeshare with Tyjae Spears on route to 25 carries. Pollard is worth scooping back up off the waiver wire for the stretch run.\nRyan Flournoy, WR, CowboysFlournoy put up big Fantasy numbers earlier this year when CeeDee Lamb was hurt and that was the case again in Week 14 after Lamb left with a concussion. Flournoy racked up 113 receiving yards on nine receptions and a touchdown. He also saw a whopping 13 targets despite not starting the game. Flournoy could continue to be a surprising factor if Lamb is forced to miss time with a concussion. He may be worth firing up as your Flex in Week 15 if Lamb is out. Harold Fannin Jr., TE, BrownsIf Fannin is still on your waiver wire, and he remains there in many leagues, it's time to scoop him up. Fannin is a favorite for Sanders and the Browns pass game is starting to heat up a bit. He racked up 114 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets via eight receptions in Week 14. He's worth starting as an every-week TE. \nTim Patrick, WR, JaguarsTrevor Lawrence continues to make major strides in Liam Coen's passing game over the last three games and that's good news for Jaguars receivers. With Brian Thomas Jr. failing to take hold of the role he earned in his rookie season -- albeit mostly with Mac Jones at quarterback and in an entirely different scheme -- Patrick was able to stand out in Week 14. Patrick finished with 78 yards on five catches and a touchdown. Given the injury situation with the Jaguars receivers this year and the steady improvement in the pass game, he's worth a speculative stash and add in deep leagues. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs will host the Houston Texans on Sunday Night Football in a pivotal matchup for both teams.

New users receive 20 100% profit boost token with your first $1 bet:Rashee Rice, Chiefs (+125)The Chiefs are making up for lost time without Rice, as Kansas City was without its most dynamic wide receiver for the first six weeks due to a suspension. The 25-year-old has five touchdowns in six games this year, including scoring twice in Kansas City's 31-28 loss to the Cowboys on Thanksgiving. Rice has at least seven targets in all six games, including back-to-back games with 12 targets, and he's averaging 9.8 targets per game as Mahomes' top option in the passing attack. The model expects this usage to continue with the Chiefs facing a situation where if they lose Sunday, they'll be in a challenging position to reach the postseason. The model views Rice as the top candidate to find the end zone on Sunday Night Football.Click here to bet on Rice as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest BetMGM bonus code, which gives new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses: Kareem Hunt, Chiefs (+155)Hunt scored a touchdown in four straight games before having his streak snapped last week against Dallas, but Hunt remains one of the most reliable scorers in the NFL. The 5-11, 216-pound back has the size to be utilized at and near the goal line, which has resulted in five touchdowns over his last five games. Even with Isiah Pacheco back from a knee injury last week, Hunt played 64% of snaps compared to Pacheco's 30%, and he had 14 carries compared to Pacheco's three. Expect a heavier Hunt usage again this week with Hunt averaging a reliable 4.0 yards per carry, and the model projects value in Hunt at +155 odds to score on what's likely to be a chilly Sunday evening in Kansas City. Click here to bet on Hunt as a Sunday Night Football anytime TD scorer with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $200 in free bets if your first $5 bet wins: Jayden Higgins, Texans (+400)Higgins was an early second-round pick, No. 34 overall, in the 2025 NFL Draft, and he's showcased why, especially in recent weeks. The 6-4, 215-pound receiver has a touchdown in two of his last four games. After seeing more than four targets just once over his first eight games, Higgins has at least five targets in four straight contests, averaging seven targets per game during that stretch. Those targets have led to production, with more than 40 yards in three of four games after failing to reach that total in any of his first eight games. Kansas City's game plan will likely revolve around containing Nico Collins, which creates opportunities for Higgins.

    "body": "\n        In the end, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee took the path of least resistance, bringing head-to-head into the conversation for the first time this season in their final placement of Miami over Notre Dame for the last at-large spot in Sunday's 12-team bracket.Ninth-ranked Alabama did not move despite a 21-point loss to Georiga in the SEC Championship Game, centering the discussion on the Hurricanes and Fighting Irish for the last spot. Miami entered the final rankings at No. 12, while Notre Dame was No. 10.Both teams were idle during conference championship weekend.\"We felt like the way BYU performed in their championship game, a second loss to Texas Tech in a similar fashion, was worthy of Miami moving ahead of them in the rankings,\" committee chair Hunter Yurachek said Sunday. \"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side-by-side comparison. … The one metric we had to fall back on was the head to head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"Yurachek said Duke's win over Virginia and the idea of the ACC being excluded from the bracket entirely \"had absolutely no impact\" on the decision to include Miami at No. 10.\n\"Our charge is to rank the top 25 teams, then you fill out the 5 highest-ranked conference champions and seven at-large spots for the bracket,\" Yurachek said.Miami ended the season on a four-game winning streak with a margin of victory at 27.5 points per game. The Cougars, after losing to Texas Tech on Nov. 1, had won three straight at a 21 points per game clip prior to Saturday's 34-7 beatdown at the hands of the Red Raiders. The metrics were extremely tight when it comes to Miami's case against Notre Dame (10-2) and BYU (11-2) on paper. Game control was this committee's preferred metric as we've seen the last four weeks of rankings and ranked wins are supposed to mean something -- and they did during final deliberations.\nIn terms of common opponents as it relates to Notre Dame specifically, Miami beat NC State 41-7, Syracuse 38-10, Stanford 42-7 and Pittsburgh 38-7. And the Hurricanes beat three of the four common opponents shared with Notre Dame by an even wider margin.Following Tuesday night's penultimate rankings, Yurachek left the door open for the Hurricanes. A loss for BYU placed Miami right behind Notre Dame for the first time during this playoff discussion and was the final data point needed for the boost.\"The management committee during the offseason provided some clarification to some comments that were made last year, and indeed idle teams can move following the results of the championship games,\" Yurachek said earlier this week. \"And how they impact the teams that are around those that play in the championship game and data such as strength of schedule, teams that may be idle. So yes, teams that are idle can move up or down.\"\nMiami will travel to seventh-seeded Texas A&M in the opening round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When we look back at the 2025 regular season, we may be pointing to Week 14 as the pivotal moment that sculpted the playoff picture. Coming into the weekend, the slate had the promise of being an inflection point with multiple divisional matchups on deck between clubs in the thick of the playoff race. That included Steelers-Ravens duking it out for first place in the AFC North, along with Bears-Packers squaring off at Lambeau Field in an NFC North duel, and Colts-Jaguars jockeying for position atop the AFC South. And those games did not disappoint.Pittsburgh and Green Bay both pulled off wins to jump back into first place in their respective division. Meanwhile, Jacksonville held its spot atop the AFC South after taking down Indy, but the headline from that contest was Daniel Jones leaving the game due to an Achilles injury. That further shakes up the playoff picture in the AFC. As the dust settles on Sunday's Week 14 action, let's take a look at this latest snapshot and see who would be in and out of the playoffs. On top of the standings, we'll also run through the entire playoff picture, including the remaining schedules for each primary contender. \n\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 14 grades: Chiefs get 'C-' for ugly loss to Texans, Josh Allen carries Bills to 'B-,' Rams earn 'A+'\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nComplete playoff pictureThis is the NFL playoff picture as it stands, with the following teams tabbed for postseason spots:AFC standingsDenver Broncos (11-2)New England Patriots (11-2)Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Buffalo Bills (9-4)Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Houston Texans (8-5)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (11-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersAfter winning their 10th straight game, the Broncos are back atop the AFC as the No. 1 seed. They currently get the edge over New England thanks to a superior conference record (7-2 vs. 6-2). While the conversation is currently about whether or not the Broncos can secure the No. 1 seed, it shouldn't be overlooked that they have a solid cushion in the AFC West and are primed to win it for the first time since 2015. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (11-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Bills, at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots were on the bye in Week 14 and have a massive contest against the Buffalo Bills at Gillette Stadium next Sunday. While that game won't flip the standings in the AFC East in the event that New England loses, a win could effectively lock it up for Mike Vrabel's club. Beyond fending off Buffalo, a win next week would also keep pace with Denver for the No. 1 seed. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Jets, at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars created some wiggle room for themselves in the AFC South with a win over the Colts on Sunday. That's the fourth straight win for Jacksonville, which is now set to host the Jets in Week 15. With Daniel Jones now out for the year with an Achilles injury, the division is a two-team race between them and the Houston Texans. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-6)Remaining schedule: vs. Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensPittsburgh is back in first place in the AFC North after defeating the Ravens; however, there is still a lot to be determined in this division. The Steelers and Ravens are still only separated by a game and have one more head-to-head matchup in Week 18. Before then, Pittsburgh has some tricky games ahead of it. The Dolphins have been spunky in recent weeks, and then they will have to go on the road in Week 16 and Week 17 against the Lions and Browns. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Buffalo Bills (9-4)Remaining schedule: at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt cannot be overstated how important Buffalo's comeback win over the Bengals was. After erasing the double-digit, fourth-quarter deficit, the Bills improved to 9-4, which keeps them within range of the Patriots in the AFC East, leading up to their showdown in Foxborough next Sunday. The victory also has them with a solid hold on the top wild card spot.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Eagles, at Chiefs, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosLos Angeles still has its Week 14 matchup with Philadelphia on Monday night, but comes out of Sunday holding the No. 6 seed in the AFC. That said, they'll need to win on Monday or else fall out of the playoff picture due to a head-to-head tiebreaker working against them with the Colts, thanks to a loss in Week 7. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (8-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Cardinals, vs. Raiders, at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have clawed back into the playoff picture as the No. 7 seed thanks to an impressive win over the Chiefs. Houston is just a game behind the Jaguars for first place in the AFC South, so there is room for this climb to go even higher.In the huntThe Colts (8-5) are mathematically still in the hunt, but after losing Daniel Jones for the season due to a torn Achilles, it's hard to envision them finishing well enough to get into the playoffs. The clock may have struck midnight for the Chiefs (6-7) after falling to the Texans on Sunday night. They continue to be out of the playoff picture, are now under .500 again, and are on the wrong side of a number of key tiebreakers. The team that may have the best chance of this group to make the postseason is the Ravens (6-7). Even after losing to the Steelers, they still have a lane to leapfrog them for first place in the AFC North and still have one more matchup against them in Pittsburgh in Week 18. Surprisingly, the Dolphins (6-7) are still lurking on the outskirts after winning four straight games, but a lot needs to go right. On top of likely needing to win out, Miami would need some wild card contenders to collapse, as they currently lose head-to-head tiebreakers to the Colts, Chargers and Ravens. \nNFC standingsLos Angeles Rams (10-3)Green Bay Packers (9-3-1)Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6)Seattle Seahawks (10-3)San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Chicago Bears (9-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Los Angeles Rams (10-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Lions, at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams bounced back nicely after their upset loss to the Panthers in Week 13 by blowing out the Cardinals, 45-17. Matthew Stafford looked more like his MVP self as well, throwing for three touchdowns. That win helped push them atop the NFC as the No. 1 seed, but they'll need to finish strong to hold onto this spot. Specifically, these next two weeks against Detroit and then at Seattle will give us further clarity on where L.A. will ultimately end up.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Green Bay Packers (9-3-1)Remaining schedule: at Broncos, at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay is back atop the NFC North after taking down the Chicago Bears at home. The Packers offense came through in the clutch, particularly some hard running by Josh Jacobs late. While the Packers may have recaptured the top spot in the division, things are still very much up in the air in the NFC North, especially if they fall to the Broncos in Denver next week before taking on the Bears again in Week 16.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, vs. Raiders, at Commanders, at Bills, vs. Commanders\nPhiladelphia still has its Week 14 matchup to play on Monday night against the Chargers, but it stands on solid footing at the moment. The Cowboys losing to the Lions on Thursday and dropping to 6-6-1 took a lot of wind out of their sails in their pursuit to catch the Eagles in the NFC East. If Philly pulls off the win on Monday, that creates even more breathing room. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6)Remaining schedule: vs. Falcons, at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersThe Bucs were on the wrong end of arguably the biggest upset of Week 14, losing at home to the New Orleans Saints. While they are still atop the NFC South at the moment, Tampa Bay is now knotted with the Carolina Panthers -- who were on the bye in Week 14 -- for first place. The Bucs have the momentary edge, but they've yet to play any of their two matchups against Carolina, so this division is very much still up for grabs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (10-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Colts, vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle is in a pretty comfortable position coming out of Week 14. The Seahaws are just one of two teams in the entire conference with double-digit wins. However, the problem is that the only other team with 10 wins is the Los Angeles Rams, who beat them out at the moment due to the head-to-head tiebreaker. That said, they still have one more game against L.A. in Seattle, and have a healthy position as a wild card entry if they cannot unseat them for the NFC West crown. They also catch a break in Week 15, facing an Indianapolis Colts team that just lost Daniel Jones (Achilles) for the year. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Titans, at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe Niners were on the bye in Week 14, so they'll be well-rested for the final four games. Out of the gate, it's pretty favorable for San Francisco, hosting a 2-11 Tennessee Titans team before visiting the Colts, who will be without Jones. That creates a strong path to securing a wild card spot, but there is room for this team to go even higher if the pieces fall into place. The 49ers split the head-to-head series with the Rams and currently have a better division record, so they'd leapfrog them if they find themselves with the same record. Meanwhile, the club also owns the head-to-head tiebreaker over Seattle thanks to a Week 1 win before they square off in the regular-season finale. So, there is a path for the 49ers to win the NFC West and possibly end up as the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Chicago Bears (9-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Browns, vs. Packers, at 49ers, vs. LionsWhat a difference a week can make, right? Chicago entered Week 14 as the No. 1 seed in the conference and is now clinging to the No. 7 seed after falling to the Packers at Lambeau Field. While that is quite the fall from grace, all isn't lost. If Chicago takes care of business next week against the Browns and gets some help from the Broncos, who host the Packers, we could be looking at another massive NFC North duel between the Bears and Green Bay in Week 16. If they aren't careful, however, they do run the risk of falling even further, especially with the Lions looming.In the huntThe Lions (8-5) pulled off a key victory over the Cowboys on Thursday, which slots them in as the No. 8 seed. They have a high-octane offense that could help propel them back into the playoff picture, but they have a tall task next week, visiting the Rams. Carolina (7-6) may have the best chance at making the playoffs, despite being the No. 9 seed after Week 14. They are tied with the Bucs for first place in the division and still have both matchups on the horizon. The Cowboys (6-6-1) may have been handed a critical hit with their loss to Detroit. They now likely need to win out and get a lot of help to squeak in either via the NFC East or as a wild card team. \n            ",

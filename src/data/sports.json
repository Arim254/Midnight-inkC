    "body": "\n        Arizona guard Bryce James, the son of NBA superstar LeBron James, has yet to play in his team's first three games of the 2025-26 season, including the Wildcats' 84-49 win over Northern Arizona on Tuesday. While it's common for players not in the regular rotation to play in nonconfrence games in garbage time, James has yet to make an appearance, creating speculation on when or if he will play this season. After the game, Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said that redshirting James and his teammate, Mabil Mawut, is \"on the table.\"\"No final decisions have been made,\" Lloyd said. \"It's tough. It puts you in a tough situation. You play Bryce in a game like this [against Northern Arizona] for three minutes, it burns a year of eligibility. I wish it was easier.\"I wish there was a set number of games you could play a guy like they have in football. I think that would make sense for some of these kids, but we don't. I want Bryce to have the best college basketball career and the most options in his college basketball career long-term, whatever that looks like. Throwing a kid with a lot of potential that's developing, he or Mabil, a few garbage minutes -- it might feel good now, but potentially down the line it could be something you regret.\"\nJames, a three-star recruit out of Sierra Canyon High School in Chatsworth, California, committed to Arizona earlier this calendar year after receiving offers from Duquesne and Ohio State. James was not expected to play a significant role for the Wildcats this season due to the depth of the roster, which is why a redshirt year could make sense for his long-term development as a college player.Why redshirting James is the right move for ArizonaArizona finished with the No. 2-ranked recruiting class in the 2025 cycle in the 247Sports team rankings. The Wildcats landed five-star recruits Brayden Burries and Koa Peat and signed five more players: Dwayne Aristode, Sidi Gueye, Ivan Kharchenkov, Mawut and James. The Wildcats also returned key players from last year's team like Jaden Bradley, Anthony Dell'Orso, Tobe Awaka and Motiejus Krivas. The amount of talent returning and the blue-chip recruits entering the program created an uphill climb for James to log significant minutes as a freshman.\nDuring Arizona's first three games, Lloyd has been utilizing an eight-man rotation. And it's worked. The Wildcats recorded an upset win over reigning national champion Florida during the opening night of the season, in large part because of the play of Peat, who finished with 30 points against a stout opposing frontcourt.\n        \n            \n                2026 College Basketball Early Signing Period Primer: What to expect during a big week of top 25 commitments\n                \n                    Travis Branham                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPeat and Burries have been in the starting lineup in each of the first three games, while Gueye, Kharchenkov and Aristode have all played in at least two games -- which means all of those players have hypothetically burned their redshirts. In the case of Peat and Burries, that won't matter much because both project as first-round picks in the 2026 NBA Draft.Near the end of Arizona's win over Utah Tech last week, fans started chanting \"We want Bryce!\" And although it would be logical (on the surface) to get James some minutes this season, utilizing a redshirt year while Arizona has a Final Four-caliber roster will benefit all parties in the long term.\n\"I have been very direct -- redshirting is on the table for him,\" Lloyd said. \"That's why he hasn't played in a game yet. Otherwise he would be playing some minutes in some of these games, especially at the end. We have had multiple conversations with Bryce about it. I think we are on the same page. No final decision has been made. The decision as of now is to protect his opportunity to redshirt. That's the decision that's being made.\"So, if you're expecting James to play a game this season, you may have to wait another year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Quarterback Kyler Murray's prospects with the Arizona Cardinals took a turn for the worse last week on Election Day. Murray got a vote of no confidence from coach Jonathan Gannon and the Cardinals.Gannon indicated during his weekly radio interview with Arizona Sports 98.7 FM that Jacoby Brissett would be starting at quarterback in Week 10 against the Seattle Seahawks even if Murray wasn't dealing with a right foot sprain that has kept him out of action ever since Week's 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans.The Cardinals placing Murray on injured reserve the following day overshadowed that he was essentially benched for a journeyman backup quarterback. Murray is eligible to return from IR for Week 14's game versus the Los Angeles Rams on Dec. 7. There's plenty of speculation about whether Murray will play again this season. Arizona's offense has been better under Brissett although that isn't reflected in the won-loss column. In Brissett's four starts, the Cardinals are averaging 24.8 points and 351.3 yards per game with a 1-3 record. Arizona has averaged 18.8 points and 288.4 yards per game while winning two of Murray's five starts. Murray has only produced seven pass plays of 20 yards or more. Brissett has twice as many with 14 while taking 25 fewer offensive snaps than Murray this season. Pro Bowl tight end Trey McBride had a hard time finding the end zone with Murray. He is a red zone threat with Brissett. Five of McBride's six touchdowns in 2025 have come from Brissett.\nMurray is in the second year of the five-year, $230.5 million contract extension, averaging $46.1 million per year, he signed in July 2022. The 2019 first overall pick is under contract through the 2028 season. Murray is scheduled to make $125,234,860 over the next three years (2026 through 2028). Out of Murray's $42,542,500 for 2026, $36.8 million is fully guaranteed. The guaranteed money consists of Murray's $22.835 million base salary and $13.965 million of his $17 million fifth day of the league year roster bonus, which is due next March 15. His 2026 salary cap number is $53,260,677.The ultimate decision about Murray reportedly will be made in the offseason. Gannon and Cardinals general manager Monti Ossenfort don't have an allegiance to Murray. He received his contract when Kliff Kingsbury and Steve Keim where serving in those respective capacities. Murray's situation is expected to come to a head before next March 15 (i.e.; the fifth day of the 2026 league year). That's when Murray's completely unsecured $19.5 million 2027 base salary is fully guaranteed. He is scheduled to make $36.335 million on a $41,246,177 cap number in 2027. \nIt's hard to imagine Murray having significant trade value primarily because of his contract. The inclusion of an unprecedented \"homework\" clause in Murray's contract, which the Cardinals subsequently removed, requiring at least four hours of independent study during game weeks raised issues about his work ethic. Unlike most of the NFL's highest-paid quarterbacks, Murray's contract doesn't contain a no-trade clause. The Cardinals were able to get a 2019 second-round pick and a 2020 fifth-round pick for 2018's 10th overall pick Josh Rosen, the quarterback Murray replaced, from the Miami Dolphins during the 2019 NFL Draft. The draft capital received for Rosen is probably more than Murray would command because he had three fully guaranteed years worth $6,239,388 remaining (and a fifth-year option that could be exercised) left on his cost-contained rookie contract when traded. \n        \n            \n                Kyler Murray done as Cardinals QB? Steelers, Jets among possible landing spots along with Kingsbury reunion\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf the Cardinals could find a trade partner comfortable with Murray's existing contract, there would be $15,629,354 of 2026 dead money, a salary cap charge for a player no longer on a team's roster. The Cardinals would gain $37,631,323 in 2026 cap space by moving Murray. He would be off Arizona's books after 2026 freeing up $41,246,177 and $46,357,360 of cap space, respectively, in 2027 and 2028. \nIt's more likely that the Cardinals will have to eat part of Murray's 2026 salary for him to be dealt. For instance, the Cardinals converting the $17 million 2026 roster bonus to signing bonus prior to a trade would increase the 2026 dead money to $32,629,354 and lower the 2026 cap savings to $20,631,323.Murray having to change the guarantee vesting date for his 2027 base salary wouldn't be out of the question either. This could be accomplished by having the injury guarantee still kick in as scheduled in March with the $19.5 million becoming fully guaranteed in 2027 either on the fifth day of the waiver period (five days after Super Bowl LXI on Feb. 19, 2027) or the fifth day of the 2027 league year that mid-March.Releasing Murray is a viable alternative if a trade doesn't materialize. The Cardinals would have $52,429,354 in dead money by cutting Murray without a post-June 1 designation before the 2027 salary guarantee vests. The $52,429,354 would be the second most dead money ever related to an individual player in one league year behind only quarterback Russell Wilson's $53 million, following his release from the Denver Broncos in March 2024. Murray's dead money would consist of the $36.8 million in 2026 guaranteed salary and $15,629,354 in bonus proration from 2026 and 2027.\nThe insurance on Murray's contract reducing the bonus proration attributed to 2027 by $2,288,823 because of his right ACL tear during the 2022 season is why there would be a modest 2026 cap savings of $831,323 rather than a $1,457,500 increase in 2026 cap charges. Murray would be off Arizona's books starting in 2027.The Cardinals are in a position salary cap wise to handle a conventional release of Murray. There are $275.5 million of 2026 cap commitments with 50 players under contract, according to NFLPA data. The top 51 salaries (i.e.; salary cap numbers) matter under offseason accounting rules. The Cardinals have $15.39 million of existing cap space that can be carried over to 2026. With a similar increase as in 2025, the 2026 salary cap should be in the $300 million to $305 million range. If the season ended today, the Cardinals would have the 11th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Arizona would be a in a position to find Murray's successor in the first round.Presumably, Brissett would serve as a bridge quarterback for the Cardinals in 2026 if they parted ways with Murray. He joined the Cardinals in March as an unrestricted free agent on a two-year, $12.5 million deal, averaging $6.25 million per year. Brissett is scheduled to make $5.44 million in 2026 on a $7.19 million cap number.\nA change of scenery might do Murray some good. Veteran quarterbacks who were also early first-round picks, such as Sam Darnold, Daniel Jones and Baker Mayfield, are thriving in 2025 for teams that didn't draft them.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles and coach Nick Sirianni won their third straight game by defeating the Green Bay Packers, 10-7. As the final score indicates, this was not some offensive shootout. The defense held Jordan Love's unit to 261 yards of total offense, while DeVonta Smith led the way offensively with four catches for 69 yards and Philly's lone touchdown.Once again, star wideout A.J. Brown was not involved in the game plan. He caught two of three targets for 13 yards. This marked the fourth game of the season in which he recorded below 30 receiving yards. In all, Brown caught 31 passes for 408 yards and three touchdowns in eight games played. Entering Week 11, Brown is tied for 61st in receptions, and ranks 50th in receiving yards.Brown voiced his displeasure with his role in the offense on social media earlier this season, and he's doing something similar now. Recently, Brown joined streamer jankyrondo to play some \"Madden 26.\" Brown made several comments during the live stream indicating that he was upset. When jankyrondo asked him how he was, Brown had this to say:  \n\"No. Where have you been?\" Brown replied with a laugh. \"Family's good. Everything else? No. It's a shitshow. You on some 'How you been?' I've been struggling brother.\"\nThis was not all that Brown said. He continued to voice his displeasure, saying \"If you got me on fantasy (football) man, get rid of me.\"\nBrown of course peppered his Madden avatar with targets, saying, \"Good things happen when you get touches.\" \nAfter the Madden matchup, in which Brown caught nine passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns, he said, \"I'm telling you bro, that's the only highlights of damn football I'm living right now.\"\nThe question has to be asked, was Brown doing a bit? Was he joking around? But if he was joking around, what purpose does this serve? Brown put himself in the headlines once again with comments that surely don't endear him to his franchise or the fan base.During a Wednesday morning interview with 94 WIP in Philadelphia, reporters asked Sirianni about Brown's comments. \n\"Yeah, I mean, you can, again, when there's obviously (the) ability to debate what he meant or what he said, or 'Hey, why did you say why there?' Sirianni said. \"Listen, you go with your interactions with guys on a daily basis, and not what people are ... speculating, or anything like that. We're going to continue to try to get better on offense, and we played a great game on defense. We are in tune to what's going on here and the relationships that we have in here, and the process that we have in here, and A.J.'s all-in.\"\nThere was some speculation that Brown could be moved at the trade deadline, but ultimately, he wasn't. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman told reporters that teams trying to win Super Bowls don't trade away talents like A.J. Brown.\"I think that when you're trying to be a great team, it's hard to trade great players, and A.J. Brown's a great player,\" Roseman said. \"He wears the 'C' for a reason. He's an important part of this team, of this organization. He cares about winning, he cares about his teammates, and I think that when you're a team like ours that is looking forward to an opportunity to compete for a championship, you just don't get rid of guys like that. We feel very lucky to have him on our team and excited about the second half of the season with him.\"\nRecently, it looked like Brown's role in the offense was getting to where it should be. He exploded for 121 yards and two touchdowns on four receptions in the Week 7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, but injured his hamstring and missed the Eagles' next game against the New York Giants. Then came the disappointing outing in Green Bay, and now, these comments.Sirianni says that Brown is \"all-in,\" while Brown says he's struggling, and clearly not happy with his contributions to the offense. Up next for the Eagles are the Detroit Lions in Philly for \"Sunday Night Football.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 18 Michigan had a hiatus from the College Football Playoff last season, but the Wolverines have made three of the last four -- including a 2023 national championship. Heading into the home stretch of the season, the program still has an outside shot to reach the postseason again. The Wolverines are 7-2 and on a three-game winning streak since losing to USC. However, they're also coming off of a mediocre performance against Purdue and need every break to go their way in the final weeks. With that said, here's how Michigan stands in November with only weeks until College Football Playoff Selection Sunday. Michigan's College Football Playoff pathCollege Football Playoff Ranking: No. 18Seed: N/ABest wins: Nebraska, WashingtonLosses: No. 11 Oklahoma, No. 17 USCRemaining pathat Northwestern (Nov. 15)at Maryland (Nov. 22)vs. No. 1 Ohio State (Nov. 29)Michigan's resume comes down to a one-game playoff against No. 1 Ohio State. The remaining games are against bottom-half teams in the Big Ten that won't earn the Wolverines many style points. But Ohio State has been completely unblemished to this point.If Michigan beats Ohio State, they will still need some help to reach the Big Ten Championship Game. USC has a head-to-head tiebreaker, so they would need to lose another game to open the door. Oregon also needs to lose to either Minnesota or Washington, as they could end up in a separate three-team tiebreaker that Michigan would lose. \nVegas saysMichigan's odds to make the College Football Playoff are rough, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The Wolverines feature only +680 odds, which is worse odds than Tulane and nearly on par with Pittsburgh. The odds for the Wolverines to miss the CFP are at -1200. Ohio State is an early 5.5-point favorites against Michigan. We think ...There's only one pathway for Michigan to even have a shot to make the College Football Playoff: Beat No. 1 Ohio State. And even then, that might not be enough. Perhaps the greatest complication for Michigan will be its specific losses, neither of which were close. A 31-13 loss to USC means the Wolverines are dependent on the Trojans losing another game. Losing 24-13 against No. 11 Oklahoma means that Michigan is in trouble if compared to either Oklahoma, or a Texas team that beat OU by 17 points. \nAnd then, Michigan's best wins -- Washington and Nebraska -- have fallen apart down the stretch. The Huskies horrifying loss against Wisconsin means they have no shot to get ranked. The Cornhuskers will finish with a decent record, but any upside from the victory is gone after Dylan Raiola suffered a season-ending injury. Frankly, beating plucky New Mexico 34-17 might be their next-best win. Michigan is on a four-game winning streak against Ohio State, the program's longest against the Buckeyes since 1991. A far worse Wolverines team was able to pull the upset last season. If they pull it off, it could be enough to shake up the conversation. But there's no guarantee. \n    \n                                        \n    If you want all of the latest Michigan news and scoop, there's no better place than TheMichiganInsider.

    "body": "\n        The AFC East rivalry of Patriots vs. Jets kicks off NFL Week 11 on 'Thursday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET, with the rosters differing in appeal with NFL DFS picks. The Pats, who are favored by 12.5 points, offer the likes of MVP contender Drake Maye, standout rookie TreVeyon Henderson and four-time Pro Bowler Stefon Diggs as options for NFL DFS lineups. Meanwhile, the Jets have the 28th ranked total offense and will be without receiver Garrett Wilson (knee). However, Wilson's absence should allow other wideouts to emerge for an offense centered around Breece Hall, which could provide NFL DFS sleepers that you can get at a discount of a price.Justin Fields will have to throw it to someone downfield as with New England having the league's No. 1 run defense, through the air may be New York's preferred option to move the ball. Which under-the-radar players could be a part of your NFL DFS strategy, and what other daily Fantasy football advice should you heed for 'Thursday Night Football'? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Jets vs. Patriots on 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

After being held out of the end zone over the first seven games, Hall has three touchdowns, in addition to 272 scrimmage yards, over his last two games. He also has an impressive history versus New England, averaging 120.7 total yards, with two total touchdowns, over his last three matchups with the Patriots. While New England is strong versus the run, it is susceptible to pass-catching RBs, which Hall certainly is, as no team has allowed more catches to running backs in 2025 than the Pats. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson after the rookie went for 150 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns versus what was a top-10 run defense last week with Tampa. He won't see a top-10 run defense on TNF as New York ranks 25th versus the ground game and has allowed 158-plus rushing yards in back-to-back games. Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) has missed the last two games, paving the way for Henderson to see the bulk of touches again, and all but one starting running back this year has had at least 85 yards or a touchdown versus the Jets. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        Notre Dame (7-2) has been on a tear since opening the season 0-2, firmly placing itself back in the College Football Playoff conversation as it aims for a return trip after last year's runner-up finish. After narrow losses to Miami and Texas A&M by a combined four points to start the season, the Fighting Irish have navigated a much easier slate over the past two months, winning convincingly and racking up the largest average margin of victory among undefeated FBS teams since Week 4 -- tied with Ohio State. That dominant stretch has allowed Marcus Freeman's squad to rebuild confidence and make a strong case for remaining in the CFP top 10 heading into the final three games.Notre Dame's College Football Playoff pathCollege Football Playoff Ranking: No. 9Seed: No. 9Best wins: No. 17 USCLosses: No. 15 Miami, No. 3 Texas A&MRemaining pathat No. 22 Pittsburgh (Nov. 15)vs. Syracuse (Nov. 22)at Stanford (Nov. 29)Notre Dame's been in must-win mode since starting the season 0-2. The CFP remains in sight for the Fighting Irish, who are just three games away from returning to the bracket. The first test is the toughest of the stretch: a road trip to No. 22 Pittsburgh, which has won five straight since Mason Heintschel took over at quarterback. A win would make the path forward much clearer; a loss would effectively eliminate Notre Dame.If they get past the Panthers, the schedule eases. The Fighting Irish close out against Syracuse and at Stanford -- two ACC teams near the bottom of the conference standings and already out of contention for bowl eligibility -- offering a chance to pad wins to their résumé and finish the season strong.\nVegas saysOddsmakers are firmly on board with Notre Dame making the CFP again, listing the Fighting Irish at -385 to reach the 12-team bracket -- the eighth-best odds on FanDuel Sportsbook as of Nov. 12. Still, a return to the playoff isn't a guarantee, with +300 that they miss out, reflecting some caution about the road trip to Pittsburgh and the need to avoid any late-season slip-ups.We think ...Notre Dame sits in a \"win and you're in\" spot given its positioning in the CFP Rankings. If the Fighting Irish take care of business in their remaining three games, it's unlikely they'll be leapfrogged by multiple bubble teams, barring a series of narrow or unimpressive victories. The win over USC in October strengthens their résumé as the lone top-25 victory and could be a decisive factor if the Trojans make a late push.Notre Dame is a 12.5-point favorite on the road against No. 22 Pittsburgh, so there shouldn't be much reason to doubt that the Fighting Irish will handle their first test of the final stretch and cruise into the CFP riding a double-digit game win streak.\n\n    \n                                        \n    Led by Tim Prister, who has covered Notre Dame since 1982, the staff at Irish Illustrated is on the ground covering every Fighting Irish practice and game.

WNBA star Caitlin Clark teed it up with Nelly Korda in the pro-am on Wednesday, and 18-year-old Kai Trump, the granddaughter of President Donald Trump, was given a sponsor's exemption to play in the tournament this week. Prior to playing in her first professional event, Trump officially joined the University of Miami's women's golf signing class, as she followed through on her commitment to join the Hurricanes next year. \"I love the coaches. It's close to home. Great school,\" Trump said in her press conference on Tuesday. \"I love the people there. My cousins went there as well, so I know people that have gone there. You know, it's a great university and I'm looking forward playing for them.\"\nAs for Miami, the Hurricanes are preparing for the increased spotlight that will come with the president's granddaughter playing on the team -- particularly given Kai Trump's sizable social media following. \n\"We view any potential exposure as positive for Miami golf,\" Hurricanes coach Janice Olivencia told the Associated Press. \"Our current team is a very mature and intelligent group of women. So, we anticipate that we will handle all the attention with great composure and enthusiasm.\"Trump is currently ranked 461st in the American Junior Golf Association rankings after playing in three AJGA events this season. Ahead of her debut in an LPGA Tour event, Trump got some sage advice from Tiger Woods, who is dating her mother, Vanessa Trump.\n\"I mean, he is the best golfer in the entire world. I would say that. And even better person,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"He told me to go out there and have fun and just go with the flow. Whatever happens, happens.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        An attorney representing former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown filed a not guilty plea on his client's behalf Tuesday in response to the attempted murder with a firearm charge he is facing after a May shooting. Brown was on his way to Florida via transfer from a New Jersey jail this week after being extradited from Dubai to the United States to face trial earlier this month, according to the Miami Herald. Jail records in Essex County, New Jersey, show Brown was released Tuesday for transfer. Mark Eiglarsh, Brown's lawyer, acknowledged his client's not guilty plea in an email to the Associated Press.During a Wednesday hearing Brown attended via video, a judge ordered the former NFL wideout to be released on $25,000 bail and must wear a GPS ankle monitor, according to the Associated Press.\"He no longer has a passport. He'll be living at his home. I look forward to working with him zealously on this case,\" Eiglarsh told circuit judge Mindy Glazer.Brown was involved in a May 16 altercation following a celebrity boxing event in Miami. Several videos from the incident circulated on social media, as well as pictures of Brown in handcuffs. Brown claimed police detained him, but released him that same night. \nBrown claims on social media that he was \"jumped by multiple individuals\" who tried to steal his jewelry, \"and cause physical harm to me.\" He even said that he would speak to attorneys about pressing charges on the individuals that allegedly assaulted him.However, one month later, a warrant obtained by The Washington Post stated that police received video footage showing Brown punching a man, and then appearing to take the gun of a security officer and run towards the individual. Two gunshots were then heard. The alleged victim in this case told investigators that a bullet possibly grazed his neck, and that he went to a local hospital to be treated. According to the warrant, patrons in the parking lot told police that Brown was the shooter.Brown's attorney said that the affidavit is mistaken, and that Brown actually used his own personal firearm to fire the shots -- which he claims were not aimed at anyone, according to the Associated Press.\nBrown, who turned 37 in July, last played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021, and was a member of the Super Bowl LV team. Regarded as one of the best wide receivers of the 2010s, Brown earned First Team All-Pro status four times, and made seven Pro Bowls. Brown starred for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2010-18. He led the league in receptions and receiving yards twice, and receiving touchdowns once.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        No. 5 Georgia hosts No. 10 Texas Saturday night in the marquee game of the Week 12 college football schedule, and Kirby Smart left no stone unturned when it comes to preparing for the Longhorns. Smart confirmed on Wednesday's SEC coaches teleconference that he had fired Florida coach Billy Napier come by the Dawgs' practice on Tuesday. An ex-Florida coach swinging by the practice of his former top rival would be notable any week, but especially with Georgia set to face Texas, a team Napier's Gators upset in their biggest win of the season. Florida beat the Longhorns 29-21 in what was the Gators' best offensive performance of the season. DJ Lagway completed 21-of-28 passes for 298 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, while Jadan Baugh ran for 107 yards and one touchdown on 27 carries. On the other side of the ball, the Gators turned Arch Manning over twice and sacked him six times en route to the victory that extended Napier's tenure in Gainesville for a few more weeks.Georgia looks to replicate Florida's success against a Texas defense that has been stingy for most of the season, aside from that trip to Gainesville (and later, Starkville). The Longhorns were a bit shorthanded in that Florida game, with top corner Manny Muhammad out for the game, but the Gators still produced one of the best complete offensive gameplans of the season against Texas. It's one thing to go over tape from that game to see what Florida did well, but it's another to be able to dive deeper and pick the brain of the coach who crafted that plan. \nUnemployed coaches dropping by practice does not represent an uncommon occurrence, and Napier and Smart go back to when they were both assistants under Nick Saban at Alabama. So, while it's not a surprise Napier would be willing to provide an assist for Smart even though they were rivals a few weeks ago, it is notable and offers some insight into the depth with which Smart and the Dawgs are preparing for the challenge Texas presents.Since that loss to Florida, Texas won four straight including wins over ranked foes Oklahoma and Vanderbilt, but are still trying to prove they can handle the challenge of a big road environment. Both of Texas' losses have been on the road and they got dragged into deep waters by Kentucky and Mississippi State in their two road wins this season. \nNow they head to Athens to face a Georgia team hitting its stride of late. The Bulldogs will be well-versed in how the Gators pulled off their upset of Texas a month ago. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Right now you can use the latest FanDuel promo code to receive $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Tuesday features games in the NBA, NHL, college football and college basketball. We're zeroing in on Senators vs. Stars in the NHL, Ohio vs. Western Michigan in college football and New Mexico vs. UC Riverside in college basketball. Western Michigan 5-1 against the spread in its past six games at home, but SportsLine's model is backing the Bobcats, who are 10-1 in their last 11 games in conference play. Picks from all three of those games are among our Tuesday best bets at FanDuel Sportsbook from SportsLine's team of experts and the SportsLine Projection Model. Claim the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our FanDuel promo code review for full details.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times. Since its inception, it has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks. Anybody following its college football betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.  Tuesday best bets at FanDuel SportsbookSenators money line vs. Stars (-118)Ohio money line vs. Western Michigan (+102)UC Riverside -19.5 vs. New Mexico (-108)Combining the model's three picks into a three-leg parlay at FanDuel would result in a payout of +612 (risk $100 to win $612). Bet it at FanDuel here:\nSenators money line vs. Stars (-118)\"This will be the Dallas Stars' first trip to Canada this season. They have won nine games, eight of which were victories by one goal, including a streak of six consecutive one-goal wins. Both teams have a goal differential of -3. However, Dallas has a shot differential of -37, while Ottawa is at +27,\" SportsLine NHL expert Jeff Hochman said. \"Linus Ullmark will be in goal for the Senators, and he's 2-0 with a 1.46 GAA and .952 save percentage against Dallas over the last three seasons. With both teams playing their third game in four days, let's ride with the Senators at home.\" Back the Senators at FanDuel Sportsbook:Ohio money line vs. Western Michigan (+102)Both of these teams are in a four-way tie atop the MAC standings at 4-1 in conference play, but Ohio is the defending league champions and will be riding high coming off a crucial 24-20 win over Miami (OH), who is also 4-1. Sieh Bangura rushed for 102 yards and a touchdown while also catching three passes for 30 yards in the win and he's settled back in as one of the best backs in the MAC after leaving Ohio for one-season stint at Minnesota. Western Michigan's run defense has been boom or bust all season, so a lot rides on Bangura's ability to find traction. The model has the Bobcats winning in 72% of simulations. Back Ohio at FanDuel Sportsbook:UC Riverside +19.5 vs. New Mexico (-108)\"Mountain West sources are suggesting that the Lobos are a work in progress for new HC Eric Olen (via UCSD), who has an entirely new roster in Albuquerque and already giving a long look to various frosh, including top early scorers F Tomislav Buljan (via Croatia) and G Jake Hall. UNM is barely hitting 40% from the floor and 30% beyond the arc vs. limited opposition in two games,\" legendary college basketball handicapper Bruce Marshall said. \"Meanwhile, reports from the Big West indicate UCR could be a sleeper under new HC Gus Argenal, most recently a winner at CSUSB. Argenal obviously worked the portal hard for a collection of far-flung transfers such as G Marqui Worthy Jr (18.5 ppg; via UMass) & F Osiris Grady (18 ppg; via UVU).\" Back Dallas at FanDuel Sportsbook:\nWant more college football and basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's best bets for Tuesday.

And that's the case once again on Saturday when UFC makes its annual trip to Madison Square Garden for UFC 322. A pair of superfights tip the bill with (now) former champions moving up in weight in pursuit of glory in a second division. In the main event, Islam Makhachev moves up from lightweight to welterweight to challenge Jack Della Maddalena for the 170-pound title. In the co-main, Weili Zhang moves from strawweight to flyweight to face Valentina Shevchenko for the 125-pound crown.Technically, champion vs. champion super fights are a thing of the past because UFC CEO Dana White's new philosophy requires champions to vacate their titles before changing divisions. That's exactly what happened with Makhachev and Zhang, who relinquished their UFC titles to move up in weight and become two-division champions. Makhachev (27-1) set the record for most UFC lightweight title defenses, eclipsing mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and others, before moving up to challenge Jack Della Maddalena in the latter's first title defense. Della Maddalena inspired some confidence that he can give Makhachev a tough fight after busting up Belal Muhammad to become the 170-pound champion.Zhang Weili dominated women's strawweight before leaving Mackenzie Dern to pick up the vacant strap at UFC 321. Her second reign as champion saw her beat Amanda Lemos, Yan Xiaonan and Tatiana Suarez. Now she seeks to put an end to Shevchenko's second women's flyweight title reign, which Shevchenko kick-started after ending her series with former champ Alexa Grasso.Below is the complete fight card for UFC 322, along with the latest odds.

The Blue Devils are off to a 2-0 start to the season after picking up wins over Texas and Western Carolina, while Army is coming off an 83-76 loss to St. Thomas (Minnesota). This game will be the ultimate crossover for former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. He graduated from West Point and began his head coaching career with Army before taking the job with the Blue Devils in 1980. Krzyzewski will be recognized prior to tipoff.The Blue Devils are entering a new era after reigning CBS Sports National Player of the Year Cooper Flagg departed to the NBA. Duke is led by star freshman Cameron Boozer, who is a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. He is coming off his best performance of the season after posting 25 points in a blowout win over Western Carolina. Army is led by Kevin McCarthy and Jackson Furman, who both enter this matchup averaging 16 points per game. McCarthy scored a team-high 18 points during the Black Knights' 73-49 win over SUNY-Maritime. Here is everything you need to know ahead of Duke's matchup with Army on Tuesday. \n Where to watch Duke vs. Army  live  Date: Tuesday, Nov. 11 | Time: 7 p.m. ET   Location: Christl Arena -- West Point, New York \tTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder]  Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App Duke vs. Army: Need to knowDuke's starting lineup has been as expected: Heading into the season, there were four spots in the Blue Devils' starting lineup accounted for: Isaiah Evans, Cameron Boozer, Dame Sarr, and Patrick Ngongba II. However, the final spot (point guard) was up for grabs between junior Caleb Foster and incoming freshman Cayden Boozer -- the brother of Cameron. Ultimately, Foster won the job and has been in the starting lineup in each of the first two games. Foster was part of Duke's star-studded 2023 recruiting class, and his role has fluctuated throughout his time in Durham. With a more steady role in place, Foster is someone to keep an eye on to steady the ship after Tyrese Proctor played that role last season.Army vs. Duke is a rare matchup: In the past 40 years, only one current Power Five program has traveled to West Point to face Army: Duke. The Blue Devils won that matchup 78-45 against Army on Nov. 16, 1997. Almost 28 years later, Duke will return to West Point for a fun nonconference showdown. In true nonconference road games, Duke is 3-3 over the last 10 years. Army is looking to pull off a huge upset. The Black Knights are 2-43 all-time against ranked opponents and have lost their previous 24 games over that span. The last win against a ranked team came in 1977, when Army defeated Kansas State.Duke's top-ranked recruiting class is headlined by the potential No. 1 pick: Since taking over for Coach K, Duke coach Jon Scheyer has done an excellent job on the recruiting trail. The Blue Devils landed the No. 1-ranked class last year, headlined by former No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, and once again have a top-tier class. Duke finished as the No. 1-ranked recruiting class again this past cycle -- which included landing Boozer -- the No. 3 overall prospect in the cycle. Also in that class were Sarr, Boozer's brother Cayden, five-star Nikolas Khamenia and four-star Sebastian Wilkins. Sarr was a late add to Duke's recruiting class after Cedric Coward elected to stay in the 2025 NBA Draft instead of transferring to Duke. Coward went on to become a lottery pick and has been one of the top rookies so far.Duke vs. Army prediction, picks Odds via FanDuel SportsbookDuke looked strong during the second half of its win over Texas last week. The Blue Devils should be able to cruise to a victory behind the play of Boozer, who looks like a legit candidate for National Player of the Year. Boozer's supporting cast (Isaiah Evans, Dame Sarr and Caleb Foster) is also strong. The Blue Devils cover the spread behind a big night from Boozer, who will record his second double-double of the season. Pick: Duke -30.5\nWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.           \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The latest College Football Playoff Rankings saw plenty of change among the at-large spots after a chaotic Week 11 slate. Three teams featured in the previous bracket were cycled out of the field during Tuesday's rankings reveal after getting upset to bring in an entirely new round of competitors. BYU was the most notable casualty, as the Cougars lost their spot after a 29-7 loss on the road against Texas Tech. BYU was still listed as one of the first teams out, so there is a path back to the playoff if the Cougars finish the year on a high note. The same cannot be said for Virginia, which plummeted from projected ACC champion to out of the race entirely after it suffered a home loss to unranked Wake Forest. Memphis was supplanted by fellow American Conference power South Florida as the Group of Six's representative, as well. Though the lower rungs of the bracket went through some change, the projected first-round byes remained entirely unscathed. Ohio State, Indiana, Texas A&M and Alabama still occupied the first four seeds.  \nThis bracket is a projection heading into Week 12. Here is a look at how the College Football Playoff bracket looks after the second CFP Rankings release. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            ACC still in the hunt for multiple bids The selection committee choosing to rank Miami first among ACC teams and subsequently projecting the Hurricanes as the conference's champion is an odd choice. The chances that Miami actually makes the ACC Championship Game are next to zero. The Hurricanes already have two losses in conference play, which puts them behind the five one-loss ACC teams atop the league's standings. In the event that chaos reigns, Miami would still lose head-to-head tiebreakers against Louisville and SMU. \nThis does mean that the ACC's hopes for multiple bids are still alive. It's clear that, regardless of its ACC championship status, the committee thinks highly of Miami. The Hurricanes also have a head-to-head advantage against another potential bubble team in Notre Dame, which remained at No. 9 Tuesday. There's a world in which the ACC champion -- be it Georgia Tech, Virginia, Louisville or a team outside the rankings -- and Miami both make the cut come December. \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Why Miami -- ACC's highest-rated team -- won't make the field\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTexas Tech pushing for a bye Texas Tech jumped one spot to No. 6 following its monumental rout of BYU. While a miniscule move may not seem significant in a vacuum, the Red Raiders vaulted over Ole Miss and came one step closer to securing a first-round bye. \nIf Texas Tech can finish the regular season undefeated and cap things off with a Big 12 championship, it will have a case to secure a top-three spot at the very least. The current top four consists of two SEC teams and two Big Ten teams. Only half of that field can actually win a championship. A 12-1 Texas Tech with a Big 12 title would be a stronger candidate for a top-four seed than an SEC or Big Ten school that lost in their championship game. Vanderbilt hanging around Vanderbilt's had a tough November. The Commodores suffered a major setback on Nov. 1 when they lost to Texas and then got taken to the brink in a Week 11 showdown against an Auburn team that is 1-6 in conference play. \nDespite the latest streak of less-than-desirable results, though, Vanderbilt actually moved up two spots to No. 14 in the latest poll. Given that the Commodores rank ahead of a couple of projected conference champions, they're still a little outside of the \"first team out\" range, but they are well within shouting distance of an at-large spot. If they can take care of business against Kentucky and No. 23 Tennessee to finish with a 10-2 record, that would likely be enough to make the cut in an expanded field. \n            ",

    "body": "\nStephen Curry is set to return Tuesday following a three-game absence because of an illness, and the Golden State Warriors hope their star guard is the cure to what ails them when they visit the defending NBA champions Oklahoma City Thunder. Tipoff is set for 8 p.m. ET from the Paycom Center. The matchup will serve as a daunting but accurate litmus test for a Golden State team that started the NBA season 4-1 but has dropped four of its past six. The Warriors have lost their last four contests away from home and are facing a Thunder team that has yet to lose on its home floor. Oklahoma City returns from a four-game road trip in which its lone defeat -- and only loss so far this season -- came to the Portland Trail Blazers 121-119.The Warriors come in on a positive note behind a 114-83 home win over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday but now embark on a road trip that includes back-to-back games against the Spurs, as well as matchups at New Orleans, Orlando and Miami.\"I think it's significant,\" Golden State veteran center Al Horford said. \"I know it's still November, but it's a big challenge for our group and the way to address it, and I know that we will. We'll take it a game at a time and we can't overlook anyone.\" Oklahoma City is a 7.5-point favorite and the over/under for total points scored is 227.5 in the latest NBA sportsbook odds for Warriors vs. Thunder.In addition to the NBA marquee showdown, we'll look at a matchup on the gridiron and a key NHL contest as part of the games to watch for Tuesday, Nov. 11.NBA best bets today, where to watchGolden State Warriors at Oklahoma City Thunder Time: 8 p.m. | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Thunder -7.5 \nAlthough the return of Curry undoubtedly makes Golden State more dangerous, the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see the future Hall of Fame sharpshooter making enough of a difference for the Warriors to keep pace with the blistering Thunder. In fact, the model believes the presence of Curry providers a discount on the point spread that can be exploited. Its 10,000-game simulation sees Oklahoma City coming out on top by an average score of 124-109, covering the spread a whopping 68% of the time in the process. It all adds up to an \"A\" grade selection on the Thunder, a rare classification that indicates an extremely strong position. The model also offers a moderate lean on the Over 227.5 points. CFB best bets today, where to watchOhio Bobcats at Western Michigan Broncos Time: 8 p.m. | Location: Kalamazoo, Mich. | TV: ESPN2 Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Ohio +1.5 \nThis Tuesday night MAC showdown might fall under the radar for some college football observers, but hardcore fans will savor this battle of clubs that are both 4-1 in the conference and fighting for supremacy in the top-heavy league. Both teams have won five of their past six. While the Broncos are 1.5-point favorites in this game, the SportsLine Projection Model sees this as a lopsided contest in Ohio's favor. Its 10,000-game simulation forecasts an outright Ohio win and thus a cover around an astounding 71% of the time. These numbers result in another rare \"A\" grade selection for the model on Bobcats money line.NHL best bets today, where to watchColumbus Blue Jackets at Seattle KrakenTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Seattle| TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Expert : Seattle -120 (Matt Severance) The SportsLine Projection Model has a moderate lean on the Blue Jackets, but top NHL SportsLine expert Matt Severance (+543 on the NHL this season) likes it the other way and has released a play on the Kraken. He notes this is the end of a dreadful road trip for Columbus in which it has lost the first four, with three of those defeats coming by one goal. Severance also notes the Kraken have won their past three home contests against the Blue Jackets. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Bill Belichick is not worrying about anything but North Carolina's next opponent. The UNC coach knows there's an opening in the NFL that many will link him to, but his attention is on Wake Forest.Belichick's name has been tied to the New York Giants coaching vacancy since Brian Daboll was relieved of his duties following New York's Week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears. In classic Belichick style, he downplayed the question while reaffirming his commitment to his current role. \"I've been asked about it from time to time, but I've been down this road before,\" Belichick said. \"I'm focused on Wake Forest. That's it, and that's my commitment to this team, and next week, it'll be to our next opponent, and so forth. But, you know, I'm here to do the best I can for this team.\" It's easy to see why so many have speculated about Belichick's possible interest in the Giants, and vice versa. Prior to winning six Super Bowls with the Patriots, Belichick won a pair of Super Bowls as the Giants' defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells. He was carried off the field by Giants players after New York shut out Washington in the 1986 NFC title game en route to defeating the Broncos in Super Bowl XXI.\nFour years later, Belichick's defense held the mighty 49ers' offense to just 13 points in what was one of the biggest upsets in conference title game history. A week later, his defense made even more history by holding the prolific Bills offense to just 19 points in the closest Super Bowl ever played. Belichick's controversial game plan worked; New York's defense (which often lined up with just two defensive linemen) allowed Thurman Thomas to rush for 135 yards, but it succeeded in neutralizing Jim Kelly and the Bills' prolific passing attack. That game plan currently resides in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2009, during a return trip to Giants Stadium, Belichick broke down in tears while reflecting back on his years with the Giants. Ironically, it was the Giants who handed Belichick's Patriots two of his three Super Bowl losses that includes New York's shocking upset over the previously-undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. \nWhile he said that he is focused on his current task as the Tar Heels' coach, Belichick didn't rule out the possibility of taking the Giants' job, either. Until he does, or until the Giants hire another coach, don't expect this storyline to go anywhere anytime soon. \n            ",

The 28-year-old Alexander is contemplating retirement, according to The Athletic.The Eagles acquired Alexander from the Baltimore Ravens earlier this month for a late-round draft pick swap. The Eagles sent a 2026 sixth-rounder to Baltimore for Alexander and a 2027 seventh-rounder. Alexander has only appeared in two games this season, both with Baltimore, and did not travel with the team for a matchup against the Green Bay Packers on Monday night. The team listed him as out with his designation as \"knee/coach's decision.\"Alexander, a second-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl selection in 2020 and 2022, has only recorded five tackles in two games this season. Alexander spent his first seven seasons with the Packers and became one of the top at his position in the NFL. He has 12 career interceptions, all with the Packers. However, Alexander was limited to just seven games in both the 2023 and 2024 seasons and he signed a one-year deal to join the Ravens after Green Bay released him.\n\n        \n            \n                Eagles 'called out' Packers' play on game-deciding fourth down, Josh Jacobs explains\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlexander, the No. 18 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft out of Louisville, has racked up 292 total tackles during his eight-year career. His best season came in 2022, when he finished with 56 total tackles and a career-high five interceptions.The Eagles were busy in the days leading up to the trade deadline to bolster their secondary. Philadelphia added Michael Carter II from the New York Jets before acquiring Alexander from the Ravens.\nThe Eagles improved to 7-2 with a 10-7 win in Green Bay on Monday night. Next on the schedule is a Sunday night home matchup with the Detroit Lions. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 offseason in Major League Baseball is fully underway, which means we're gradually ticking off the dates on our offseason calendar. That also means a steady supply of rumors, most of which center on free agency and trades (along with the occasional hiring and firing). Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's supply just below. Tucker a possibility for Dodgers Will the top-rated free agent pair up with the top-rated team this offseason?\nKyle Tucker is available on the market, the Dodgers have a need at the outfielder corners, and they have the resources and competitive will to make it happen. As one of the best all-around players in baseball (when healthy), Tucker seems like an ideal fit in L.A. for 2026 and beyond. However, such a pairing is not to be assumed. The Dodgers have some impressive outfield prospects on the way, and as the Athletic reports they may be inclined to sign a veteran outfielder to a short-term deal to serve as a bridge to those incoming outfield prospects. Possibilities on that front include free agents Harrison Bader and Trent Grisham, or it's possible the Dodgers could revisit trade talks with the Guardians regarding Steven Kwan. Mets would \"love\" to re-sign Alonso, DíazBetween first baseman Pete Alonso and closer Edwin Díaz, the Mets could lose two of the top 15 players on the free-agent market. Yet New York's top baseball operations decision maker isn't ready to rule out a possible return.\n\"We love both Pete and Edwin. They've been great representatives of the organization,\" president of baseball operations David Stearns said Tuesday at the GM meetings. \"We'd love to have them both back. At this stage of the offseason, it's really tough to predict any outcomes, but certainly, we would love to have both those guys back.\"Of the pair, Díaz would seem more likely to re-up with the Mets. Alonso, conversely, was a late re-signing last spring and appears to again be a redundancy given the Mets already employ a surplus of corner infielders, including Mark Vientos, the most logical candidate to take over at the cold corner if and when Alonso departs. Contreras may stick with St. LouisThe Cardinals, in the midst of pivoting toward some level of mid- to long-term rebuild, are likely to explore trade opportunities for the veterans remaining on their roster. The wrinkle is that those three veterans -- third baseman Nolan Arenado, right-hander Sonny Gray, and first baseman/catcher Willson Contreras -- all have no-trade clauses. Arenado is certainly willing to waive his for the right fit and Gray has indicated a willingness to do the same, albeit for perhaps a narrower band of destinations. As for Contreras, he's repeatedly said he wants to remain in St. Louis as he heads into the third year of a five-year, $87.5 million pact. \nAt the end of the 2025 season, he reiterated those desires to new lead decision-maker Chaim Bloom, and the Belleville News-Democrat reports that Contreras still seems inclined to stick with St. Louis. Coming off another productive season, Contreras would probably have a market for his services, especially if he's willing to take on part-time catching duties, but for now he still seems like he wants to remain a Cardinal despite what seem like long odds of contention in 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL officially awarded Atlanta with an expansion team on Tuesday, with the league's 17th franchise scheduled to begin play in 2028 and set to stage home matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of MLS' Atlanta United and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.Atlanta's NWSL expansion team is backed by AMB Sports and Entertainment, the organization that also owns United and the Falcons and is led by Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank. AMBSE also owns Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which opened in 2017 as a multipurpose venue. While the venue seats 71,000 for NFL games and can expand to 75,000, Mercedes-Benz Stadium usually holds 42,500 for United matches. For the incoming NWSL team, the stadium will use its modification techniques for an expected capacity of around 28,000.The NWSL will reportedly collect an expansion fee of $165 million for the Atlanta franchise, according to The Athletic, the largest in the league's history. The ownership group behind the Denver Summit, which begin play next year, reportedly paid a $110 million entry fee earlier this year, while fellow 2026 expansion side Boston Legacy and 2024 entrant Bay FC reportedly paid around $53 million each.Blank's investment will include staff dedicated specifically to the NWSL team, as well as their own training ground. NWSL-specific training grounds are quickly becoming an area of focus for NWSL ownership groups, with the Kansas City Current and Angel City amongst the teams with their own facilities. Additionally, The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation will provide seed funding to launch the NWSL Foundation, which will be focused on advancing research and innovation in women's sports and have a specific emphasis on female athlete performance and health.The NWSL's new expansion chapterAtlanta is the first market to be awarded with an NWSL expansion team since the league moved to a \"rolling process,\" as commissioner Jessica Berman has described it. Since Berman assumed her role in 2022, the league has overseen two expansion rounds with a fixed deadline for bids but made the switch after becoming familiar enough with the process of welcoming four new teams.\n\"We made the decision to shift to a rolling process mostly because we've been through [these] two rounds and so we pretty much know the universe of people who are interested,\" Berman said in September. \"There's more than a dozen of them. These conversations are ongoing and each of them have a different perspective on how much time they need to launch, the investments they need to make in order to be successful, including potentially around infrastructure and we want to not force a square peg into a round hole. We want to be more flexible so that we can get the best possible result for the next round.\"Atlanta fits the NWSL's recent expansion strategy in more ways than one. Blank now has a well-documented investment in soccer with United and his $50 million commitment to U.S. Soccer's National Training Center in the suburb of Fayetteville, which is expected to open in 2026 and will bear the businessman's name. The city was also once the home of the Atlanta Beat, which played in the Women's United Soccer Association and Women's Professional Soccer before those leagues folded. The appetite for women's soccer does not end there – Mercedes-Benz Stadium set the U.S. women's national team's attendance record for a friendly on home soil when 50,000 filled the venue for a 2-1 win over Japan in April 2024.The NWSL has also favored major media markets in recent expansion endeavors. From 2022 to 2028, they will have added teams in four of the U.S.' top 10 media markets – the LA-based Angel City, Bay FC, Boston Legacy and the Atlanta team. As for Denver, home of the Summit, the city ranks inside the top 20 and has the perk of an international airport.\nAtlanta, though, will be the first NWSL expansion team despite the intent of playing on artificial turf rather than artificial grass. Mercedes-Benz Stadium would not be the first NWSL stadium with artificial turf – the Portland Thorns and the Seattle Reign, two of the league's original teams, play on artificial turf at Providence Park and Lumen Field, respectively. Boston Legacy, meanwhile, will play their inaugural season at Gillette Stadium, which is primarily an NFL venue, like Mercedes-Benz Arena and Lumen Field.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The AFC East rivalry of Patriots vs. Jets kicks off NFL Week 11 on 'Thursday Night Football', with the two rosters differing in appeal with NFL DFS picks. The Pats offer the likes of MVP contender Drake Maye, standout rookie TreVeyon Henderson and four-time Pro Bowler Stefon Diggs as options for NFL DFS lineups. Meanwhile, the Jets have the 28th ranked total offense and will be without receiver Garrett Wilson (knee). However, Wilson's absence should allow other wideouts to emerge for an offense centered around Breece Hall, which could provide NFL DFS sleepers that you can get at a discount of a price.Justin Fields will have to throw it to someone downfield as with New England having the league's No. 1 run defense, through the air may be New York's preferred option to move the ball. Which under-the-radar players could be a part of your NFL DFS strategy, and what other daily Fantasy football advice should you heed for 'Thursday Night Football'?

After being held out of the endzone over the first seven games, Hall has three touchdowns, in addition to 272 scrimmage yards, over his last two games. He also has an impressive history versus New England, averaging 120.7 total yards, with two total touchdowns, over his last three matchups with the Patriots. While New England is strong versus the run, it is susceptible to pass-catching RBs, which Hall certainly is, as no team has allowed more catches to running backs in 2025 than the Pats. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson after the rookie went for 150 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns versus what was a top-10 run defense last week with Tampa. He won't see a top-10 run defense on TNF as New York ranks 25th versus the ground game and has allowed 158-plus rushing yards in back-to-back games. Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) has missed the last two games, paving the way for Henderson to see the bulk of touches again, and all but one starting running back this year has had at least 85 yards or a touchdown versus the Jets. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'.

The victory catapulted the No. 8-ranked native of Ecuador into instant title contention. During his postfight interview, Morales gestured toward UFC CEO Dana White, who was cageside, and said, \"Boss, Dana, my belt, my belt.\" Morales, who enjoyed advantages of three inches in height and seven inches in reach, towered over his opponent from the start. But Brady (18-2), a native of Philadelphia who is known for his relentless wrestling style, never shot for a takedown and ultimately paid for it. \nDespite showing a quick and accurate jab early on, Brady was visibly hurt by a big Morales right hand. Brady then pump-faked a takedown attempt and instantly ate another left hook.\nMoments later, a looping right hand hurt Brady once again and the left hand that followed dropped him. Referee Blake Grice jumped in shortly after to stop the fight at 3:27 of the opening round. \"We knew that [Brady] was a stocky welterweight and someone that is really strong so the coaches said to keep the center of gravity low and the knockout would come,\" Morales said.Morales improved to 7-0 in the UFC with five knockouts since his debut in 2022. \nBrady entered the fight with a three-fight win streak, including a fourth-round submission over former champion Leon Edwards in May. The loss was his first since a second-round TKO against future champion Belal Muhammad in 2022. \n            \n    ",

UFC 322 brought some incredible highs on Saturday night in New York as Islam Makhachev was crowned the new welterweight champion. The native of Dagestan, Russia, outworked and outwrestled Jack Della Maddalena in the main event to take the title, joining an elite group of UFC fighters to become two-division champions.Makhachev vacated the lightweight title to move up 15 pounds and challenge for the 170-pound belt and did so in very similar fashion to his dominant run at 155. He suffocated Della Maddalena with his pressure and grappling while threatening submissions.In the other title fight on Saturday, the challenger was not as successful. Valentina Shevchenko turned away Weili Zhang's bid to become a two-division champion in a similarly dominant fashion to Makhachev. Shevchenko outmuscled her smaller opponent over five rounds to seize control over 25 minutes and earned another title defense in the process.The real fun came on the undercard where four straight fights ended via brutal knockout. It started with Bo Nickal smashing Rodolfo Vieira with a thunderous head kick in the third round. Then, Benoit Saint Denis followed it up with a 15-second dispatching of Beneil Dariush. Carlos Prates got in on the fun with a second-round knockout of Leon Edwards. And Michael Morales capped things off with a first-round knockout of Sean Brady.\nCBS Sports was with you throughout fight week with the latest news, in-depth features, and betting advice to consider.

The bout was contested at a catchweight of 157.2 pounds after Dariush (23-7-1) missed weight on Friday. The native of France instantly climbed the Octagon wall and gestured to the crowd that is deserving of a shot at Ilia Topuria's 155-pound title following consecutive stoppage wins of Kyle Propelec in May and Mauricio Ruffy just two months ago. \nDariush, a 36-year-old native of Iran, briefly dropped Saint Denis in the early going with a hard calf kick. BSD also ate a flush knee to the face as he attempted to rise back up to his feet. But the left hook from Saint Denis that followed was enough to send Dariush to his third defeat over his last four fights dating back to 2023.\"I will do whatever the UFC tells me to do and will return soon,\" Saint Denis said after the fight.\nThe 29-year-old Saint Denis, who entered as the No. 13-ranked lightweight (against No. 9 Dariush) continued to show his recuperative ability following a knockout loss to Dustin Poirier in 2024 (in which BSD was battling an illness) and a TKO defeat six months later to Renato Moicano (after the cageside doctor ruled BSD couldn't continue due to a damaged eye).  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        NEW YORK -- Looking to shake off of the criticism from his first pro defeat just six months earlier, Bo Nickal delivered a violent palette cleanser on Saturday at UFC 322 in New York. Nickal (8-1), a former three-time NCAA Division I champion wrestler from Penn State who went on to become a much-hyped UFC middleweight prospect, landed a left high kick to the side of the neck that knocked Rodolfo Vieira out cold in Round 3 of their 185-pound bout at Madison Square Garden. An emotional Nickal instantly responded to the boos moments earlier from fans who felt there wasn't enough action in the fight by jumping on top of the cage wall and delivering a double middle-finger salute. \"We are on ESPN so I won't swear, but you frickin' mother frickers, either love me or hate me, pick one,\" Nickal said. \nThe 29-year-old Nickal, who systematically picked Viera apart on the feet to cause blood to flow from his nose and eye by Round 3, rebounded from a second-round TKO loss in May to Reinier de Ridder in which Nickal responded poorly when hurt and visibly imploded. The loss came directly after a decision win over Paul Craig last November, inside MSG, when fans booed Nickal for not doing enough to entertain in a boring fight. \"I'll be honest, I get a little fired up about it but I wouldn't have it any other way,\" Nickal said. \"I love it. As long as you guys are cheering or booing, you are watching and having fun. It's all good.\"\nAfter a slow start that saw both fighters circling one another, Nickal showcased decent boxing skills in Round 1 and briefly threatened a choke after taking Viera (11-4) down. Nickal added hard body kicks in Round 2 as he stuffed both takedown attempts from Viera. \nIn the final round, after a slow start caused the crowd to become unruly, Nickal connected with a perfectly timed kick that caused referee Dan Miragliotta to instantly waive off the fight at 4:44. \"That's the game. I've lost a lot since I was a young kid and they always hit me hard but, guess, what, I bounced back and I kept coming because this is the most fun job in the world,\" Nickal said. \"I think that it's weird because I took my first loss but it gave me more belief in myself than any wins I have had prior. Tonight's fight is a testament to that. I have been dedicating my life to combat sports since I was five. I work harder in one day than most people do their whole lives. I just love coming out here and putting on a show.\"The unranked Nickal improved to 5-1 in the UFC after a pair of showcase wins in 2022 on \"The Dana White Contender Series.\"\nThe 36-year-old Vieira, a native of Brazil, fell to 4-4 since 2020 by suffering his second defeat in 2025.\n            ",

JDM also showed enough improvements in his takedown defense against Belal Muhammad that it might not be as easy as some might think for Makhachev to drown him in the grappling department. Still, it's hard to look past just how evenly well-rounded Makhachev's game has truly become and how much of a finishing threat (with 18 stoppages in 27 pro wins) he truly is, whether on the feet or on the ground. Della Maddalena will definitely make him earn it, but this is still Makhachev's fight to lose. And the 10-month layoff that the former lightweight champion enters with should help him feel comfortable at the new weight class. At the end of the day, Makhachev's technical advantages should prove to be the difference.  \nBrookhouse: I'm often guilty of overthinking simple fights, and maybe that's what I'm doing here. Something about Della Maddalena's skillset feels like it's close to what a fighter needs to deal with Makhachev's game. On the feet, Makhachev is solid, but Della Maddalena will have the edge. Makhachev will get takedowns in the fight, but Della Maddalena has good scrambling skills, and training with Craig Jones is sure to have taught the champion a few tricks. Either way, I believe this will be a difficult fight for Makhachev as he meets a tricky fighter in a new weight class.Mahjouri: Della Maddalena is a live dog, don't let Makhachev's well-deserved reputation fool you. Della Maddalena is an elite boxer with rapidly evolving grappling defense. The champ stuffed most of Belal Muhammad's takedowns and, more importantly, wasn't held down for long stretches. Pair that with Makhaev's relative struggles striking with Dustin Poirier, and you can see a case for JDM. With all that said, I'm still siding with Makhachev. The former lightweight champ is a better grappler than Muhammad. Makhachev lands more takedowns more accurately, controls better, and finishes more. Size shouldn't be a major factor either. Della Maddalena, by his own admission, isn't a large welterweight. That'll benefit Makhachev, whose physicality should translate well enough at welterweight. Expect to see Makhachev build his Hall of Fame legacy with a finish.Valentina Shevchenko vs. Zhang Weili predictionsCampbell: There's a reason why this fight has been a virtual pick 'em from a betting standpoint throughout the build to it. A pair of future Hall of Famers and decorated champions with completely evolved skill sets and nary a hole in their respective games to speak about. Both are also as technical as they are tenacious. But something will inevitably have to give in a matchup this close on paper and the biggest things separating the two fighters seems to favor Shevchenko entirely. The former bantamweight contender is slightly bigger, has more big-fight experience and is a more refined striker, particularly as a counter puncher. If Shevchenko's game is slipping at age 37, her back-to-back recent decision wins over former champion Alexa Grasso and Manon Fiorot over the past 14 months haven't shown it. While Zhang is a bit more explosive and could have an edge from the standpoint of five-round cardio should this fight be contested at a high pace, Shevchenko has too much craft not to find a way to hold her off in a technical thriller. \nBrookhouse: This fight should be great, but Shevchenko has shown the ability to neutralize explosive fighters like Weili. Shevchenko is a patient fighter who can mix tactical striking with grinding clinches and takedowns. Weili is a dynamic fighter, but one who operates best when she's free to lead the action. If Shevchenko can routinely dictate the terms of the fight, it's going to be a very long night for Weili. Weili is also coming up a division and now dealing with a stronger fighter with heaps of championship experience. Really, it comes down to the less exciting the fight is, the better things are going for Shevchenko.Mahjouri: Zhang has rounded out her game excellently, but you won't find a better all-around fighter than Shevchenko. The women's flyweight champion can strike and grapple with fantastic technique and defensive responsibility. Zhang's KO power will probably carry up in weight, but against Shevchenko, who hasn't been KOed in 18 UFC fights, it's hard to see the former strawweight queen getting a finish. Shevchenko is a hard fighter to beat on the scorecards. The judges love her, and they'll greet Shevchenko again at the finish line.Wise: While Shevchenko is deserving of her flowers as one of the pioneers of women in UFC, it seems a bit odd for a fight like this to be so close on paper for a champion of her ilk. Shevchenko has been known to bully opponents around at this weight with the relative skill level low at 125 pounds outside of her lone defeat to Alexa Grasso. Zhang, meanwhile, seems to present the most well rounded skill set she has faced since Amanda Nunes in 2017 at bantamweight. The size difference also seems negligible here in going from 115 to 125 pounds and the faceoffs this week seem to indicate just that. Both fighters could cancel out the others' strengths and turn this into an ugly brawl. But if that's the case, give me the fighter who we've seen survive that kind of battle with Joanna Jedrzcyzk before. \nSean Brady vs. Michael Morales predictionsCampbell: Consider this one heck of a style contrast in a matchup still offering strength versus strength from the standpoint of Brady's hard-nosed wrestling against the explosive striking of the 18-0 Morales. Despite the fact that Morales has a solid wrestling base, Brady's appears to be simply at a different level, which puts the onus upon the Philadelphia fighter to crowd Morales as much as possible and pull on his gas tank consistently. Brady has a strong track record of doing exactly that throughout his three-fight win streak against the likes of Kelvin Gastelum, Gilbert Burns and former champion Leon Edwards. While Morales will be dangerous for every second that the fight remains on the feet, Brady's experience edge should shine through in this one provided he can control the terms and not get caught from distance against his knockout hungry foe. Brookhouse: From our UFC 322 best bets: \"This fight may come down to wrestling. Brady averages more than 3.5 takedowns per 15 minutes while Morales defends takedowns at a success rate of 89%. Of course, Morales hasn't faced a murderer's row of great wrestlers and Brady presents a host of new tests for the Ecuadorian. Brady is more battle-tested against better opposition, and -135 feels like a good price on the higher-ranked, more proven fighter.\"Mahjouri: Brady vs. Morales is one of the more compelling fights on the card. Brady is a powerhouse with phenomenal grappling. Morales is a slick knockout artist. What makes the fight curious are their defensive lapses. Brady is a responsible defensive striker, but it's hard to shake how Muhammad -- who has two knockouts in 20 UFC fights -- finished Brady on the feet. Morales' takedown defense isn't foolproof, but no one has managed to keep him down. A grappler vs. striker fight that could go either way, I'll lean with Brady's experience over Morales, the latter of whom has yet to be tested by an elite prime welterweight. \nWho wins UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $1,500 on his UFC main-card picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Multiple NBA teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, have been asked by the league to hand over cell phones and documents as part of its continued investigation into illegal sports betting, according to The Athletic. Late last month, Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former player and coach Damon Jones were arrested by the FBI amid a wide-ranging investigation into rigged poker games and illegal sports betting. The scandal rocked the NBA and the sports world and the league has recently faced scrutiny from Congress over its gambling policies and relationship with sportsbooks. \"The NBA engaged an independent law firm to investigate the allegations in the indictment once it was made public,\" an NBA spokesman told The Athletic in a statement. \"As is standard in these kinds of investigations, a number of different individuals and organizations were asked to preserve documents and records. Everyone has been fully cooperative.\"In particular, Congress has sought answers as to why Rozier was allowed to continue playing after the league looked into suspicious betting patterns regarding a March 2023 game. Rozier played in more than 100 games before he was arrested in October. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said last month that the league \"couldn't find anything.\"\n\"Terry, at the time, cooperated and gave the league office his phone. He sat down for an interview. We ultimately concluded that there was insufficient evidence -- despite that abberational behavior -- to move forward,\" Silver said. \"We then worked directly with law enforcement -- as they said at the press conference, the league has been cooperating. That was obviously over two years ago. The federal government has subpoena power, can threaten to put people in jail, can do all kinds of things that the league office can't do. We've been working with them since then.\"\n        \n            \n                NBA gambling scandal: Adam Silver makes first public comments, says he was 'deeply disturbed' by allegations\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter meeting with Congress, the NBA, through an outside law firm, reportedly began contacting teams to request phones, phone records and other items and documents as part of an expanded investigation into illegal gambling. At least 10 Lakers employees are reportedly expected to be asked to surrender phones and phone records. Lakers assistant trainer Mike Mancias and executive administrator Randy Mims have already surrendered their phones and are cooperating with the investigation, per The Athletic. \nNeither Mancias nor Mims have been charged with a crime, nor were they named in either of the indictments filed by the Department of Justice. According to prosecutors, Jones sold information relating to the injury status of Lakers players and on at least one occasion allegedly received information from an unnamed trainer. The players were not named in the indictment, but context points to them being LeBron James and Anthony Davis. \n        \n            \n                NBA gambling investigation: Damon Jones allegedly sold information about LeBron James, Lakers\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJames reportedly had no knowledge that Jones was selling information about his injury status. \nOn Nov. 6, Jones pleaded not guilty to two charges. He was released on a $200,000 bond and he is prohibited from gambling or making contact with organized crime as part of the bond terms.In the wake of the DOJ's indictments, the NBA has begun the process of reviewing its gambling policies and exploring methods to protect the league and its players. \"Given the spread of legal betting to the majority of U.S. states, the recurrence of integrity issues across sports, and the emergence of novel betting formats and markets,\" the league said in a memo last month. \"this is an opportune time to carefully reassess how sports betting should be regulated and how sports leagues can best protect themselves, their players, and their fans.\"\nThe league is also \"barreling toward substantial changes in team rules for reporting injury statuses,\" according to The Athletic.\n            ",

Mariscal uses his pace, pressure and grittiness to intimidate his opponents and wear on them. His volume-striking attack makes him dangerous, but it's his ability to grapple and scramble that give him the edge in this matchup. Sabatini is a Ju-Jitsu ace, with 13 of his 19 pro wins coming by submission. He is a savvy grappler who can keep his opponents pinned to the mat. However, I have a hard time seeing him do that to Mariscal, who has never been submitted in his 18-6 pro career. Mariscal has a 73% takedown defense rate and has shown the ability to get up when taken down. If this fight plays out on the feet, Mariscal's relentlessness will overwhelm Sabatini.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev picksVithlani has strong picks for Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev and other bouts on the UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev card.

    "body": "\n        Few teams — maybe no teams — scheduled as aggressively for the nonconference portion of their schedule this season like UConn. After the turbulent, high-profile failure from last season — when the Huskies fell well short of being Final Four material, let alone winning a third straight national title — Dan Hurley leaned into the obstacles. It would've been understandable if the Huskies merely scheduled competitively. But look at what's still to come. They scheduled like they wanted to atone for bad behavior. On Saturday night, they played like it — for the most part. The six-pack of notable high-majors Hurley's third-ranked program has on the docket over the next four weeks began on Saturday, with the highly hyped top-10 matchup against No. 7 BYU in Boston at TD Garden. No. 3 Connecticut won 86-84, staving off a collapse after leading by as many as 20 points in the second half against a shorthanded Cougars team that opened the game down one starter and soon lost another.What felt like a trending Connecticut runaway through the first 25 minutes of gameplay turned into a teeth-clenching save of a victory against a dangerous offense and one of the most talented players in college basketball, Cougars freshman AJ Dybantsa, a possible top pick in the NBA Draft\nBYU made UConn earn it in the final five minutes. Hurley doesn't like to finish that close, but he also can take satisfaction that this team can pull out a win like this. His group last season blew a few games of this ilk. It wasn't beautiful, but it was a win. It was different than how this probably would have gone a season ago.Credit to Dybantsa, who scored 21 of his game-high 25 points in the second half, with more than half of those points coming in eyebrow-raising fashion. Dybantsa played his first of what will be an untold number of games in an NBA uniform TD Garden. Had he brought BYU all the way back, it would have been the most notable individual performance of the first two weeks of the season. Even shy of that, it's still encouraging for Dybantsa and BYU that he was able to easily find the switch to flip in the second half and be the catalyst for what would have been a remarkable comeback — especially down two starters. \nDemary is next man up BYU didn't dress Kennard Davis Jr. in the wake of his arrest for charges of driving under the influence of a substance that has still not yet been revealed. In the first half, critical senior big man Keba Keita took a blow to the head from Silas Demary Jr., eliminating him from the game. \nEven without two of its five best players, BYU carved itself back into a close game — and could have tied it or won outright if not for Rob Wright III's sixth turnover, which came with 12 seconds remaining when he lost the ball between his legs when BYU trailed 85-82. Dybantsa never got a chance to touch the ball with the game on the line. Who was there to pick up the steal when Wright coughed it up? Demary.And he's my biggest takeaway from Saturday night. Yep, even above Dybantsa's highlight -reel display in a losing effort.If UConn is going to return to Final Four form this season, it's going to take a lot of things coming together. Silas Demary Jr.'s role on this team is paramount to that objective. They need a guy like him in order to win out a handful of games against really good teams.\nWe saw it for the first time on Saturday night. We'll see it multiple times again over the next four months. At 6-foot-4, nearly 200 pounds with above-average strength for a combo guard, Demary brings a player profile that UConn lacked last season. That Huskies team needed toughness, size and game-over-game continuity in the backcourt. On Saturday, Demary provided the antidotes. No doubt, he probably had Hurley thinking to himself, Where was this last year?, like when he hit a pair of shots (one a bunny with 3:15 remaining, the other a delicate mid-range fadeaway with 1:31 left) that increased UConn's cushion from five to seven each time. Those four points were critical as BYU kept slicing away at the deficit. His two-way presence is going to go a long way to making sure this season won't be like last season for Connecticut. \nDemary finished with 21 points, seven assists and five rebounds. Alex Karaban and Tarris Reed Jr. also had 21 points apiece, but their ability and value are understood in that locker room and by UConn's fan base. (Reed was playing through a hamstring strain that's still not fully healed, per Hurley's postgame comments.) It can't just be Karaban and Reed and Solo Ball, who didn't have a good game. Who stepped up and made up for Ball's foul-plagued evening? Demary. He looks like a Dan Hurley player. When BYU sniffed blood, Demary wouldn't let the pendulum swing all the way in the Cougars' favor.Tough stretch ahead for HuskiesSo, one big opponent down and five more to go in the ensuing 27 days. Next up for Connecticut is another glitzy game, a matchup that has the potential to be the best we'll get in November. Saturday was a top-10 affair, but how's top-five sound? Because that's what we're getting on Wednesday at Gampel Pavilion, when No. 5 Arizona flies cross-country to take a crack at the Huskies. The Wildcats just knocked off No. 15 UCLA on Friday night in Los Angeles and look like an incredible test with Koa Peat, another potential top-five pick in the frontcourt. \nAnother massive game in a loaded November slate for college basketball. Another opportunity for UConn to show that last season was an aberration, that the Huskies again have the pieces to match up with the best teams the sport can offer. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas freshman guard Darryn Peterson, the projected No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, will be out for the \"immediate future\" due to a hamstring injury, coach Bill Self told reporters after his team's 76-57 win over Princeton on Saturday. Peterson has missed his team's last two games due to the injury, and his status for Kansas' marquee matchup against No. 4 Duke on Tuesday remains unclear.\"We're not obviously gonna have him, you know, at least for the immediate future,\" Self said. \"I just don't know how long that'll be.\"\nPeterson, one of the most highly touted guard prospects to come out of the high school ranks in years, made his collegiate debut against Green Bay earlier this month, finishing with 21 points, four rebounds and three assists. In his last appearance against North Carolina on the road, 247Sports' No. 1-ranked player in the 2025 recruiting cycle scored a season-high 22 points in a 87-74 loss.Self told reporters earlier this week that Peterson's hamstring issue has been lingering for \"weeks,\" but he has played through it. Notably, Peterson didn't finish an exhibition game against Louisville due to a cramping issue and also exited the second half against Green Bay due to cramps.\n\n        \n            \n                The future is here: Meet the college basketball stars destined for the 2026 NBA Draft\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"He's played with it,\" Self said earlier this week. \"But it's still sore. So medical staff and everybody think it's something that's healing and getting better. But the reality of it is, after the Carolina game, you guys remember that first burst that he had when he stole the ball and had the layup first two points of the game? He didn't do anything bad to it, but he said it just felt different since then, like tight. That's all it is, is tightness.\"Peterson has the fourth-best odds (+950) behind Duke's Cameron Boozer, Texas Tech's JT Toppin and Purdue's Braden Smith to win National Player of the Year, per FanDuel.What makes Darryn Peterson an elite NBA prospect?Peterson has started to create some separation among his peers to become the NBA's No. 1 overall pick in the summer. However, if you ask 10 people who follow the draft closely to predict the first three picks in the draft, you might get 10 different answers. While the top pick has been dominated by forwards, wings and bigs in recent years, Peterson has a chance to become the exception.\nIn CBS Sports' NBA Draft prospect rankings by Adam Finkelstein, Peterson was ranked No. 1, ahead of BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Boozer -- both of whom are wings/forwards at the NBA level.He finished as the top-ranked prospect in last year's recruiting class and begins this draft cycle in the same place. Peterson is a big, playmaking guard who continues to improve each year. His overlap of positional size, length, strength and shot creation is unmatched in this class. In fact, he may be the best domestic guard we've seen in several draft cycles. If the shot-making we've seen early on at Kansas proves sustainable, he could be even better than expected. The last guard taken with the No. 1 pick was Cade Cunningham in 2021. Since 2010, only six prospects who have gone No. 1 have been classified as a guard. Although Cooper Flagg has been utilized as a point guard through the first few weeks his NBA career by the Dallas Mavericks, he is a traditional wing at the NBA level.Part of the intrigue around Peterson is his potential to be a volume scorer at the NBA level. Peterson is also a talented defensive prospect who can defend at a high level because of his size and athleticism. But what stands out the most -- and why he may ultimately go No. 1 -- is his shot making that is second to none in this class. Peterson has all the makings to be an elite scorer at the next level.\nWhat does Darryn Peterson's injury mean for Kansas?Losing Peterson for an extended period of time would be a major issue for the Jayhawks, currently ranked No. 25 in the AP Top 25. It's no secret that Kansas has struggled to generate offense without Peterson on the floor. Peterson has served as the primary ball handler within the offense and is the go-to scorer for the Jayhawks.Even with the jump second-year forward Flory Bidunga has taken on the offensive end, there is a notable absence without Peterson in the lineup. Without Peterson, Kansas will rely more on veteran guard Tre White, who transferred into the program in the offseason from Illinois. He is averaging 10.0 points in three games, tied for third on his team.\nDarryn Peterson could miss showdown with Cameron BoozerIf Peterson does miss the game against Duke next week, it would be a major loss for the Jayhawks and college basketball fans as a whole. The matchup between Peterson and Boozer -- who also projects as a top-three pick this summer -- would've been one college basketball fans hadn't seen in years during the regular season.The last time players faced off in the regular season and also went in the top three of the same NBA Draft was in 2021. That year, Duke's Paolo Banchero -- the No. 1 overall pick in the 2022 draft -- went up against Gonzaga's Chet Holmgren (the No. 2 pick) in an epic showdown. \nThere have been six instances of top-three picks facing off against each other during the regular season and the NCAA Tournament since 2010. The most recent example came this past spring, when Flagg and Duke faced Baylor's VJ Edgecombe (the No. 3 pick) in the second round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Will he stay or will he go? Unless Lane Kiffin has already informed both sides of his intentions, the continued back-and-forth around the Florida vacancy has to be wearing thin on the powers that be at No. 7 Ole Miss.The likely College Football Playoff-bound Rebels -- who needed 224 yards and three touchdowns from Kewan Lacy to hold off the Gators on Saturday night -- have dealt with steady interference since Kiffin's name surfaced at the top of Florida's coaching hot board following Billy Napier's firing.There's a reason Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter has said publicly since October that the school envisions a Curt Cignetti-type deal to keep Kiffin in Oxford. And, on the other side, there's a reason Kiffin hasn't removed his name from Florida's list of candidates.Until that extension is signed, his future hangs in the balance.Behind closed doors, there has to be some level of concern at Ole Miss. On the brink of the program's first playoff appearance, the coach who got them here could be eyeing Florida -- and the slow-bleed nature of it all is what stings.\nDistractions, distractions and more distractions.Outside of Lacy's brilliance, nothing about Saturday night looked right for the Rebels. Facing a Florida team coming off a 31-point loss at Kentucky, Ole Miss never found second gear. There were red-zone miscues, an interception from Trinidad Chambliss nearly returned for a score, and a 10-point lead that vanished in two minutes on touchdown runs by DJ Lagway and Jadan Baugh.Only after the Rebels' first sack of Lagway with 1:56 left -- deep in the shadow of Florida's end zone -- could Kiffin finally exhale.Did he spend more time on social media fueling rumors than game-planning? Of course not. But his looseness in the public eye isn't helping a team with national title aspirations stay focused on its end-game.\nKiffin brushed aside much of the Florida chatter during Week 12 prep, instead laying out his criteria for what makes a job a college football \"blue blood.\"\"People will say it's narrowed, and some stuff has narrowed because you can't stockpile [talent] at those blue bloods,\" Kiffin said. \"But there are still things where you're gonna struggle to beat those guys because kids get recruited, and they see the size of stadiums, traditions, Heismans and national championships. Then your location to talent. I think all of those are in there.\"How many of those boxes does Ole Miss check?Losses to Kentucky and Florida kept Ole Miss out of last year's playoff push, and before that, a stumble at LSU in 2022 sparked a late-season slide.\nIt nearly happened again Saturday night -- against a program that has been circling Kiffin since the middle of the 2024 season, before Napier briefly righted the ship.How long will Florida wait for his answer with the Early Signing Period approaching and portal priorities looming? Both programs want clarity. Only one still has something meaningful to play for. And at this point, dragging it out serves no one.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        After firing Mel Tucker, Michigan State turned to Jonathan Smith to bring some stability to East Lansing and build the Spartans back into a Big Ten threat. As Smith nears the end of his second season, Michigan State has shown little in the way of progress as a 28-10 loss on Saturday night to a struggling Penn State squad with an interim coach dropped them to 3-7 (0-7 Big Ten) and guaranteed a second consecutive losing season under Smith's watch. Morale around the Spartans football program is at a low point, as fans grow concerned they've been lapped by the top teams in the Big Ten. As the losses have piled up and the Spartans haven't looked particularly close to a breakthrough -- six of their seven losses have been by double digits -- Smith has found his seat getting hotter by the week. That's led Michigan State fans to wonder if it's time for another coaching search, even with a highly competitive coaching carousel already forming. \nJonathan Smith buyout, contract detailsSmith signed a seven-year, $52.8 million contract in 2024 that still has $38.25 million left on it after this season. Smith's buyout clause calls for him to get paid 85% of his remaining contract, which would put Michigan State on the hook fro just over $32.5 million, payable in monthly installments through 2030. There is offset language in the contract for anything Smith makes in a future job in college or the NFL, which should mitigate some of the cost, but that's still a sizable buyout for Michigan State. Michigan State would have to feel confident they could land an upgrade over Smith to pay that much to get rid of him. The number of Power Four vacancies is already at nine, and if Michigan State made it 10 they would be closer the bottom of that list than the top in terms of how desirable the job is. Still, the lack of any discernible improvement from Year 1 to Year 2 of Smith's tenure is concerning for those around the Spartans program. If they don't feel like a turnaround is coming in 2026 with what they have on the roster and what's coming in recruiting, perhaps they'll be willing to roll the dice on another spin around the coaching carousel. \nSmith's two seasons in East Lansing have not helped raise his profile on the coaching market, but he could look to return to Oregon State as the Beavers job is open again and would be an intriguing candidate for other teams in the Group of Six. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama's doubled up Oklahoma in yardage, but the Sooners' defense dictated the moments that mattered most.Now, the Sooners' College Football Playoff hopes not only have life, but momentum heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.Their hard-hitting 23-21 victory at Alabama was as impressive as any in the sport this season. The Sooners were out-gained 406-212 by the Tide, but forced three turnovers and scored 17 points off those miscues to hand Kalen DeBoer his first home loss as Alabama's head coach.Their 212 yards?  The fourth-fewest yards by an FBS team in a win against a top-five team since 2000. Historic stuff.\nDefensive mastermind Brent Venables was at his best Saturday night inside Bryant-Denny Stadium. He spun Ty Simpson in circles with several exotic blitzes -- a slot cornerback abandoning a tight end to knife in for a second-half sack in the second half was straight out of a mad scientist's lab.The go-ahead 24-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter came only after a strip-sack produced by a backup forced into duty. Reserve defensive end Taylor Wein stepped in for star edge R. Mason Thomas and made life a living nightmare for freshman right tackle Michael Carroll, beating him twice for hurries.Alabama fell in an early 10-0 hole after Ty Simpson threw an 87-yard pick six -- the first of his career -- to Eli Bowen. The Tide bounced back, as they have most of the season, but the turnovers didn't slow and neither did Oklahoma's swarming defense, which sacked Simpson three times in the second half.\n\"They give us a spark whenever we need it,\" OU quarterback John Mateer said after the win. \"They didn't get a whole lot of turnovers at the beginning of the year, but the football gods loved them back because of how hard they play.\"That spark has turned into a fire. Oklahoma's defense has ranked among the nation's best all season, but the lack of takeaways had led to close calls and the rivalry loss to Texas. In the first eight games? Just four turnovers. In back-to-back road wins over ranked opponents? Six takeaways leading to 30 points.This wasn't easily predictable, either. Alabama ripped off three explosive plays on its opening drive of the third quarter and grabbed a 21-20 lead on Daniel HIll's touchdown. The Tide looked like they had answers coming out of halftime.\nThen Oklahoma slammed the door.The Sooners held Alabama to 15 total yards on the next three possessions, including a drive-ending sack and fumble. When Alabama mounted one final push from its own 4-yard line midway through the fourth quarter, Kip Lewis buried a crucial 11-yard sack as Alabama tried to push across midfield. Three snaps later, a last-ditch throw skipped harmlessly short of Ryan Williams as Peyton Bowen closed in.This wasn't your typical blueprint, but the Sooners again proved defense is not only important, it's paramount in heavyweight fights. Venables' pressure packages, even without star players, harkened to his championship game plans as Clemson's defensive coordinator in the mid-2010s. \nThe Sooners now share the national lead in wins over AP-ranked opponents -- tied, fittingly, with Alabama.The Tide may still win the SEC title, but their playoff odds look no better than Oklahoma's. Two-loss teams, even in the SEC, have no breathing room and Alabama must still travel to rival Auburn.The Iron Bowl on The Plains is always unpredictable, even if the Tide haven't lost there since 2019. A lot has changed since then: three full-time Auburn coaches and three interim coaches.\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma proved it can win postseason-style games on the road. The performance was the clearest sign yet of a tremendous turnaround for Venables, who started the year on the hot seat with only four combined wins against ranked opponents in three seasons.Now he has the Sooners on the doorstep of the playoffs.\n            ",

Just over three weeks, 22 days to be exact, will have passed between the last time Williams suited up for the Jets in New York's 39-38 road win at the Cincinnati Bengals on Oct. 26 and Monday, Nov. 17 in Las Vegas. \"I'm super excited. ... I haven't played a game in a long minute.

They took a chance on me and traded for me. ... They feel like I can come in to contribute and help this organization go in the right direction. That's all I plan to do.\"The 27-year-old is healthy. He just ran into having consecutive bye weeks between New York's Week 9 bye and Dallas' Week 10, which created a unique situation for the six-foot-three, 303-pound defensive tackle. Williams spent the Cowboys' bye week getting an individualized plan mapped out with the Dallas training staff to ensure his body felt like he only missed one game on a bye and not two. \n\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule: Packers, Lions face off, Cowboys host Chiefs as part of holiday triple-header\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"This is the first time I went healthy and haven't played a game, but it's like two weeks and some games... two-and-a-half weeks of something. With this coaching staff and strength and conditioning staff, we did a great job last week because my plan was just to prepare like I was going to play in a game,\" Williams said. \"Do pre-practice like I was going to play in a game because I had a bye week previously. Conditioning-wise, everything-wise, I just hit it like I was still in-season and still played in a game. I didn't play a game on Sunday, but I did a mock game amongst myself.\"What does a solo mock game look like? Williams simulating going hard for his typical allotment of 30 or 40 plays.\"Kind of 30 or 40 reps or sprints or med[icine] ball stuff. Some type of cardio thing where I can still have the same wind and things like that,\" Williams said. \"So coming back to practice this week was easy, and it's a blessing to be healthy.\"\nWilliams is joining the Cowboys at a difficult time with 24-year-old edge rusher Marshawn Kneeland's death from an apparent, self-inflicted gunshot wound occurring on Nov. 6, just two days after the defensive tackle came to Dallas. However, the tragedy has brought everyone in the organization closer together, providing an opportunity for Williams to grow as a man and with his new teammates and coaches. The situation forced him to place a higher value on the personal relationships with teammates outside of football instead of being solely focused on all ball all the time. \"The togetherness through this hardship, through this tragedy has brought everybody together,\" Williams said. \"It was unbelievable man. I've always had to take a step back in my career, especially through this tragedy. I always think to myself winning is everything to me, and I can sometimes get so deep inside myself, deep inside my game, deep inside winning that I forget to build relationships with my teammates and build relationships with my coaching staff. Going through this tragedy with the guys in the organization and with the guys in the locker room has also kind of made me grow as a human being and as a person. You're going to win Super Bowls, you're going to win playoff games with the guys that you love next to you, and you can't love anybody next to you if you don't know them. It definitely taught me a lesson.\"Williams fitting in with Dallas defense on the field Fitting in with the Cowboys on the football field has been seamless for Williams thanks to his connection with Dallas defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, his position coach with the Jets from 2021 to 2024 before Whitecotton joined new coach Brian Schottenheimer's staff in Dallas in 2025. After only one season of working under Whitecotton in 2021, Williams erupted for a career-high 12.0 sacks in 2022, earning him first team All-Pro honors and kickstarting three consecutive Pro Bowl seasons.     \n\"It was definitely easy to catch up, man, when it comes down to football. I really trusted my football IQ and the things that I can do, especially coming down to remembering the playbook and remembering what they want me to do,\" Williams said. \"It probably took me one or two days to get the whole playbook down and to come out here and just fit right in, man. ... Whatever coaching staff, whatever the scheme, whatever the team needs me to do to win football games, I'm willing to do what I'm going to do because at the end of the day I just want to win.\"That all-in attitude will be imperative for Williams because he will now be sharing the middle of Dallas' defensive line with two other well-compensated defensive tackles in three-time Pro Bowler Kenny Clark and Osa Odighizuwa, the latter of whom re-signed with Dallas on a four-year, $80 million contract this offseason. Whitecotton and Schottenheimer have said there will clearly be rotations where all three still receive a starter's level of game reps, but there will also be a higher usage of five-down fronts. That's when a defense utilizes five defensive linemen along the line of scrimmage instead of the usual four. That adjustment yielded results for Dallas' pass rush collectively as they matched the team's single-game high in sacks with five against Arizona Cardinals quarterback Jacoby Brissett in Week 9, something the Cowboys also did in Week 5 against Williams' former Jets quarterback Justin Fields. \"Yeah, it's a fair question. It's a good question. I think you saw us last game get into some of the five-down stuff. There are creative ways we can use it with those guys. We don't just have to play five-down to get those guys in the game without giving things away,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said on Thursday. \"We can move pieces around and put certain guys in different spots. I think that's part of what you'll see us do some this game, maybe even more moving forward but when you have that much talent inside, it is a problem for the defense. You talk about stopping the run, you've got penetration, you've got the ability to move those guys, package those guys in the pass rush. It's the closest thing to the quarterback. And then, you know, we are going to play some four-down. And when we do, the good news about having guys like that is they're going to be fresh. They're going to be over there catching their breath, and then when they come in, they're going to be hunting.\"\nThat arrangement is perfectly acceptable for Williams in part because he will now be lining up next to Clark, someone Williams has admired for a long time from afar. Williams said he's watched every snap of Clark's first nine seasons with the Green Bay Packers from 2016 to 2024 to learn from his game. Now, he's ready to be Clark's teammate on Monday night in Las Vegas against the Raiders.  \"It's unbelievable, man, to be able to come in and not only play with but learn from guys like Kenny Clark and Osa. I've been watching Kenny Clark fan for a long time, man, and the things he can do from a two-tech, from a three-tech. I think I watched every single clip of his at Green Bay,\" Williams said. \"Try to learn from, try to take something from [him]. Osa has been unbelievable in his career and been doing great things as well. So to be able to learn from each other, like I said, has brought us together... on the field and off the field. It's gonna be unbelievable to go play on Monday night with them.\"\n            ",

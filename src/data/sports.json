    "body": "\n        Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo's New Jersey home was pelted with eggs hours after Philadelphia's Week 13 loss to the Chicago Bears, according to police. A video on social media shows multiple people throwing objects at Patullo's home. The video includes audio of someone telling Patullo to \"get the f--- out of Philly.\" The Moorestown Police Department has stated that the investigation is ongoing.Patullo's home was vandalized following another tough outing for the offense -- scoring just 15 points while committing two turnovers while Saquon Barkley carried the ball just 13 times for 56 yards. Several days removed from the incident, Patullo, a first-year coordinator, told reporters that criticism comes with the territory of a high-profile job but anything involving a coach's family \"crosses the line.\"\"Unfortunately, it happened,\" Patullo said Wednesday. \"I've been here for five years now, and it's been awesome. This is such a unique place to coach and play. It's very special. We've been to two NFC Championship games. We've won at Lincoln Financial, a Super Bowl, the parade. It's an amazing atmosphere to be a coach and a player. And as coaches and players, we all know that part of our job is to handle criticism. It's perfectly acceptable to sit up here and talk about what's going on, how to fix it, what we're going to do going forward, and we know that. But when it involves your family, it obviously crosses the line. That happened, and at this point, we've just gotta move on.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 14 NFL picks: Packers cool off Bears in NFC North showdown, Cowboys keep rolling vs. Lions\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThrough 12 games, the Eagles' offense is 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing, 22nd in rushing and 28th in third down efficiency. Philadelphia is getting it done in the red zone, however, as it is currently tops in the NFL with a 75.9% touchdown rate. While he said that he will evaluate everything following the loss to Chicago, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni is sticking with Patullo as his offensive play-caller. Patullo, 44, has been on Sirianni's staff since he took over back in 2021. Patullo previously served as the team's pass game coordinator. He was promoted to offensive coordinator when Kellen Moore left to coach the New Orleans Saints. \"I have confidence in the entire group,\" Sirianni said. \"I know it will keep coming back to Kevin. If I thought it was one thing, I'd make those changes. Obviously, it's a lot of different things. I don't think it's Kevin.\"\nDespite their offensive struggles, the Eagles will head into their Week 14 with the Los Angeles Chargers with an 8-4 record and in first place in the NFC East. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 FIFA World Cup is officially six months away, and the tournament is a shared spotlight between three Concacaf hosts. The United States, Canada, and Mexico are all one step closer to learning who their World Cup group opponents will be in their respective groups. The World Cup draw will take place on Friday with the Stars and Stripes in Group D, Canada in Group B, and Mexico in Group A. With the biggest global tournament rapidly approaching, all eyes are on the host nations and who they'll face. The way the draw works is that the teams are divided into pots. You can check out the full pot-by-pot breakdown here. We've already sorted who would be the best and worst case scenario for the USMNT, but what about El Tri? Who could they play, and is there truly a best scenario given their recent form? Let's get into it:Draw restrictionsNo group will have more than one team from the same federation in it, except UEFA, which is required to have two groups of two UEFA teams in it, due to the fact that 16 teams will be participating in the tournament. Then there's the challenge of the intercontinental playoffs, which will not be held until after the draw. For the playoff tournament teams, the confederation restrictions will be applied to all teams involved in the playoff, which would keep the host nations from drawing a team involved in the FIFA playoff tournament due to Jamaica and Suriname being involved as Concacaf teams.\nMexico's worst-case draw Mexico's fall from Concacaf grace fizzled as fast as a summer fling, which is the last time they were in any decent form. Despite big gains in early 2025, including a Nations League title win, they hoisted the 2025 Gold Cup in July and have failed to record any wins since. They've got six months to sort themselves out, but it's tough to look at current form and the World Cup pots and not think nearly any scenario could be a worst-case situation. In an effort not to hit every single panic button in sight, here are two draw scenarios that could be disastrous for Mexico.Scenario A:MexicoNorway (UEFA)Colombia (CONMEBOL)Italy (UEFA playoff winner)With the newly expanded field of 48 teams, it could be possible that Group A gets two UEFA teams, and that would be a disaster for Mexico if it's Norway and Italy, or even Sweden or Poland. \nIt's been great seeing the rising profile of Caesar Montes on Mexico's backline, but Erling Haaland would tower over him and anyone else back there. The hope is that the starting centerbacks come out unscathed with no double yellows (or even straight red cards), so that it doesn't force the staff into any early adjustments.Colombia recently wrecked Mexico 4-0 in October, and if Italy finally punches their ticket back into the World Cup after missing out on the previous two editions, they'll be back with a vengeance. That's always a dangerous type of opponent to face when you're in questionable form.Scenario B: MexicoScotland (UEFA)Morocco (CAF) Sweden (UEFA playoff winner)Because why not be the host that gets not one but two European competitors? Feels like it'll be at least one of the hosts that gets that honor and wouldn't be surprised if it's Mexico. \nScotland are riding high on the momentum of earning a place in the World Cup, and they could be a tricky side to handle. Same with Sweden, and Mexico are no strangers to mediocre performances against them as we saw during 2018 in Russia. Morocco will also have pressure on them, as 2022 semifinalists, and favorites as current AFCON hosts. Mexico's best-case drawIf the group stage is about setting yourself up for success in the knockout rounds, then Mexico have work to do. They failed to exit the group stage for the first time in decades during Qatar 2022, and now they'll have some pressure as hosts to return to the knockout rounds. A \"quinto partido\" (fifth game) has been a long-term goal, but now there is a round of 32 ahead of the round of 16, and the home side should strive for more. If they get a favorable group, then why not hope for the best? \nMexicoIvory Coast (CAF)Iran (AFC)New Zealand (OFC)If we're simply going by rankings among other teams across the pots, this could be one of the better scenarios. If it comes down to higher-ranked \"middle\" teams to eventually land one of the lowest-ranked teams in New Zealand, then maybe it adds even more pressure on the hosts. If they don't come out as winners of a group like this, it would be considered even worse than Qatar 2022.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last two weeks have been a full-speed sprint for James Franklin at Virginia Tech.The former Penn State coach still hasn't assembled an on-field staff, and with only a skeleton group of support staffers in the building, he's been grinding: recruiting nonstop, hosting visitors, and constructing a class almost entirely from zero. The payoff has been one of the most stunning turnarounds in recent recruiting memory. Franklin has lifted a class that once sat at No. 124 in the 247Sports Composite Team Recruiting Rankings all the way to No. 22 as night fell Wednesday, which was the first day of the three-day early signing period. How did Franklin and the Hokies pull it off? Relationships. And plenty of former Penn State commits.\"It's been a scramble,\" Franklin told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"Some of these coaches that took some of these jobs around the country, and none of the recruits decommitted. One of the coaches I saw landed his plane, and the No. 1 recruit in the country was waiting for him there.\n\"We had a very different experience.\"If you didn't know already, that coach is Lane Kiffin. He ditched playoff-bound Ole Miss for LSU on Sunday and was welcomed at the Tigers' facility by defensive lineman commitment Lamar Brown, who is not quite the nation's No. 1 recruit -- but No. 4 overall is close enough. Meanwhile, the chaos in Blacksburg has worked in Franklin's favor. Cast aside by Penn State on Oct. 12 after three straight losses -- including collapses as three-touchdown favorites against UCLA and Northwestern -- Franklin has capitalized on the market. He said he hosted 17 recruits last weekend alone.The results speak loudly. Franklin has flipped 10 Penn State commitments to Virginia Tech, sinking the Nittany Lions' class to No. 150 in the rankings, one spot below FCS South Dakota State. Twenty-three players have decommitted from Penn State since Franklin's firing, leaving only two signees in the class of 2026.\nEleven of those decommits reunited with Franklin at Virginia Tech, including four-star linebacker Terry Wiggins, who flipped Wednesday. \"People are saying, 'Oh, well, Franklin's flipping all these recruits,'\" Franklin said. \"Well, it's the kids that I know and have relationships with. It has nothing to do with a previous school. It has nothing to do with hurt feelings or any of those types of things. They're the players I know. They're the players that I have longstanding relationships. And although they committed for the academics and the school, it's also about the relationship with the head coach.\"\n        \n            \n                Penn State's botched coaching search turns signing day into unprecedented disaster\n                \n                    Cody Nagel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAdding to Penn State's troubles is the lack of movement with its coaching search. Of the 13 openings in the four power conferences this fall, only two remain: Penn State and Cal. Several coaches on Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft's list of candidates have pulled out of consideration over the last six weeks – Indiana's Curt Cignetti, Nebraska's Matt Rhule, Louisville's Jeff Brohm, Georgia Tech's Brent Key, and, most recently, BYU's Kalani Sitake. \nThere was real momentum Monday for Sitake, who is 22-3 the last two seasons, but BYU's donor base rallied. Crumbl founder Jason McGowan publicly offered support, and a day later Sitake signed a long-term extension, just ahead of the Cougars' Big 12 Championship matchup with Texas Tech.On Wednesday, Virginia Tech served Crumbl cookies to media during its signing day event -- a widely interpreted jab at Penn State's latest whiff on the coaching carousel. Franklin denied any such mischievousness.\"Everybody's just trying to create drama and connect the dots,\" Franklin told CBS Sports. \"If you go back and look at the last 11 years at Penn State, we had Crumbl cookies at every single event. I think a lot of people use them. They're in all these college towns.\"\nThe dots fans can connect: this is Virginia Tech's best recruiting class since finishing 21st nationally in 2013. The program had logged only one top-25 class in the previous 12 years.\"(Tight end signee) Pierce Petersohn is asking me, 'Who's the tight ends coach?'\" Franklin said. \"I don't know. 'Who's the offensive coordinator?' You've got to trust me. 'Who's the strength coach?' You've got to trust me. \"That was happening with all of these kids. The only answer I could say is you've got to trust me.\"\nNext for Franklin is building a staff. \"We've got to move quickly because all these other jobs are filling up or are filled,\" he said.The next stretch will be another blaze of activity for Franklin, who admitted Wednesday he was \"shocked\" when Penn State fired him.\"When these decisions get made, people don't realize this affects hundreds of people,\" he said. \"It affects the coaches and their wives and their children. It affects the off-the-field staff and their wives and their children. It affects the current players and their parents. It affects the recruiting class and their parents and people not even talking. We had the No. 1 recruiting class in the country for the 2027 class.\n\"Part of me taking this job is -- not only do I want to coach, obviously -- how do I help as many people who have been affected by this? Because I feel ultimately responsible for all these people.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff selection committee made a move that raised some eyebrows in its penultimate rankings by swapping Alabama and Notre Dame for the No. 9 and No. 10 spots, respectively. The Fighting Irish, despite walloping rival Stanford 49-20, slipped behind the Crimson Tide in a changing of places that left coach Marcus Freeman puzzled.Alabama won a rivalry game of its own but was not nearly as dominant in a 27-20 Iron Bowl victory over Auburn. The Crimson Tide won by a smaller margin than the Fighting Irish, and its caliber of opponent only marginally better than Auburn, which finished the regular season with just one more win than Stanford. How was that enough for the committee to be convinced that Alabama deserved a higher ranking than Notre Dame? That is the question Freeman is left pondering.\"Obviously you're disappointed, but more so because of a little bit of confusion,\" Freeman said Wednesday. \"You're confused in terms of what we could have done differently and why we fell when we won 49-20. I think we were up 42-6 going into the fourth quarter. I don't spend time talking about other teams, but it's just like, OK, what could we have done differently? I don't know.\"\n        \n            \n                A College Football Playoff bracket without Alabama, Notre Dame or any ACC team? How this scenario could happen\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt surface level, a one-spot difference in the top 25 is hardly sizable. But given where Notre Dame and Alabama stand in the race for inclusion in the 12-team playoff bracket, one spot could be the margin between competing for a national championship and watching the CFP from home.\n\"You always look for cause and effect,\" Freeman said. \"You look for a reasoning why you go up or you fall. For me, you didn't see a great explanation for why we fell when we had the performance we did last Saturday.\"If the favorites in this weekend's conference championship games win, Notre Dame will be in position to hold the final at-large spot in the bracket. But if No. 11 BYU defeats No. 4 Texas Tech in the Big 12 Championship Game and becomes a \"bid stealer\" of sorts, the Fighting Irish would likely be the team bounced from the projected bracket.CFP committee chair explains controversial rankingsArkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek, who stepped into the CFP selection committee chair position last month, offered an explanation for the swap at the No. 9 and No. 10 spots. Now in his second year on the committee, Yurachek said the debate in the room between Notre Dame and Alabama over the last three weeks has been among the strongest he has witnessed during his CFP service.\n\"I think this week, as we looked at those two teams and how closely they have been over the past three weeks -- Notre Dame went on the road and had a strong win at Stanford, but Alabama went on the road in a rivalry game, looked really good,\" Yurachek said on Tuesday's rankings show. \"I think that was enough to change the minds of a couple of committee members to push Alabama up ahead of Notre Dame in this week's rankings.\"\n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff bracket: What 12-team field looks like after fifth CFP Rankings released\n                \n                    Will Backus                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOne possible explanation for Alabama's climb to No. 9 is that the committee may have sought to protect the Crimson Tide from falling out of the bracket in the event it loses to No. 3 Georgia the SEC Championship Game. The committee set a precedent in previous years that it wishes not to punish title game losers for falling short in a 13th data point.Yurachek, however, said that was not a consideration for this week's rankings and instead would be discussed after the championship games are complete.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Chris Paul's second stint with the Los Angeles Clippers ended abruptly on Wednesday when the franchise announced it was parting ways with the future Hall of Famer. Paul, who re-signed with the team this summer on a one-year deal, appeared in 16 games and averaged just 2.9 points.Paul, 40, posted \"just found out I'm being sent home\" on Instagram around 2:40 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The team later confirmed its decision. Speaking for the first time since Paul was released, Clippers coach Ty Lue said the partnership between the team and Paul \"wasn't a good fit.\" \"I just think it wasn't a good fit for what he was looking for,\" Lue said. \"It is what it is. Do I want to see CP go out like this? No. I have a lot of respect for him. He's been a friend of mine over the years. You never wanna see a great go out like this. But I'm pretty sure he will find something because he's a great player. ...

After stints with the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs, Paul returned to where he spent six seasons of his career and departed as one of the most iconic players in franchise history. He hoped to return to the Clippers to finish out his career making a run at an NBA title. \n\"I don't like it,\" Lue said. \"It just didn't work out like we thought it would. I don't like it for CP, but it wasn't a good fit. We understood that. So, like (I) said, it was an organization (decision). They made the choice. We move forward. We got to see what we do. We will see.\"After appearing in all 82 games with the Spurs and logging 28 minutes per game -- the most since the 2022-23 season -- Paul was in and out of the Clippers' rotation. The Clippers are off to a 5-16 start and entered Wednesday's game against the Atlanta Hawks on a five-game losing streak\n        \n            \n                The Clippers did Chris Paul dirty: 'Legendary Clipper' sent packing in the middle of the night\n                \n                    James Herbert                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"This decision had nothing to do with one incident or one meeting that did or did not happen,\" Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank said. \"Some of our business, respectfully have to keep in-house, but this didn't come down to just a one incident and one meeting.\"\nPaul averaged just 2.9 points in 14.3 minutes on 32.1% shooting for the Clippers this season. He cannot be officially moved until Dec. 15 due to salary cap reasons. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. women's national team is settling in for a long winter's nap after capping off the year with a pair of wins. The Stars and Stripes closed out 2025 with two victories against Italy and plenty of growth to reflect upon. Under the guidance of head coach Emma Hayes, 2025 was a year of player pool expansion and intentional experimentation, laying the groundwork for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. The squad will have December as time off before reconvening in January for the annual New Year camp. The unofficial window may not include certain European club players at the time, as January camps often fall outside of an official international window. That opens the door to even more extended looks at players, or re-evaluation of those already regular cast members in the expanded pool. Now the page turns towards a new year, and the World Cup qualifiers are officially less than a year away with the Concacaf W Championship set to take place in November 2026. With so many new players integrated into the program at the senior level and the U23 team, who are the ones that will make the coaching decisions increasingly difficult? We've already have a 2027 World Cup roster projection, so for this exercise, most players from the 2024 Olympic squad will not be considered. Only athletes who either earned more caps, made their debuts, and earned first-time call-ups, or have not been with the squad for an extended period of time will be categorized.\nHere's who I think is a World Cup qualifier lock, on the bubble, or on the outside looking in, for now.Locks for qualifiersGoalkeepers: Phallon Tulis-Joyce, Claudia Dickey They're the only pair of goalkeepers to earn two consecutive starts during any of the international windows, and they're both coming off big club seasons. Tulis-Joyce recently sustained a fractured eye socket that kept her out of end-of-year camps and Manchester United's recent Champions League window, but she has seven clean sheets in the tournament dating back to qualifying rounds. Dickey earned NWSL second-best XI honors and was a finalist for goalkeeper of the year. Defenders: Tara McKeown, Avery Patterson A solid club season for Patterson, though the Houston Dash's slow start hampered playoff chances. Still, the fullback made a good impression whenever she earned minutes with the USWNT, and it can't all fall upon Emily Fox. The centerback position gets a little trickier. Here's the truth: if Naomi Girma, Tierna Davidson, and Emily Sonnett are all healthy and ready to go come November qualifiers, then McKeown's battle as a depth option is up against Emily Sams. \nMidfielders: Lily YohannesPart of 2025 has also been the hampering of any expectations for a young midfielder. Hayes has been vocal about taking off the pressure for the 18-year-old, but that's been difficult to do when Yohannes keeps showing off her vision and skillset.\nForwards: Alyssa Thompson, Catarina Macario If the door is open for the Olympic gold medal-winning \"triple espresso\" attacking line of Sophia Wilson, Mallory Swanson, and Trinity Rodman to return in 2026, then they have finally some added cavalry in tow. After missing out on time with the national team for nearly all of 2024, Thompson has become a constant starter for Hayes. Also coming off a discouraging 2024 is Macario, who removed herself from Olympic selection after making the roster due to injury concerns.Now, Macario is nominated for female player of the year after functioning as a false nine in Hayes' system with seven goals and two assists. It's her best year in a USWNT kit since coming back from an ACL injury; she started nine games with her goals scored against Colombia, Brazil, China, New Zealand, and Italy.\nOn the bubbleGoalkeepers: Mandy McGlynnMcGlynn began the year with starting minutes, but those dwindled over the year with the emergence of Tulis-Joyce and Claudia Dickey's form. She's still a regular call-in as part of the goalkeeper core and will likely remain if she keeps up consistent club performances. Defenders: Lilly RealeReale has only a limited number of senior appearances (six, per Opta), but her minutes (449) rival fullback Avery Patterson's (518), while Reale has fewer appearances (six) this year. This is a positive for the program, as the outside back role has often been a point of concern over a lack of depth, but now there are options.Midfielders: Jaedyn Shaw, Olivia Moultrie, Claire HuttonSome good problems are emerging for Emma Hayes and her staff. Both Shaw and Moultrie are players who began the year as part of the U23 squad, and were examples of player profiles by Hayes as players who could be ready now vs. players who could be ready later.\nForwards: Michelle CooperHow does one buy stock in Cooper? Let me know immediately. I rate her that highly. I think the USWNT coaching staff also rates her. Quite possibly the best example of the U23 integration, Cooper got time in January 2025 futures camps, earned a spot on the national team in February and never gave it back. A late-season injury kept her out of the Kansas City Current's playoff appearance and the final international window of the year, but she played 10 games for USWNT, with one goal and two assists, all while being a wrecking winger in the process. OutliersGoalkeeper: Jordan SilkowitzWhile Bay FC had a challenging season that led to an early elimination from playoff contention, goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz was a bright spot. The injury to Tulis-Joyce opened a spot, and if the Bay keeper maintains form, maybe Silkowitz will be that fourth depth chart keeper. \nDefenders: Kennedey Wesley, Gisele Thompson, Jenna Nighswonger, Crystal DunnFirst and last time Jenna Nighswonger made a camp roster was in January. Crystal Dunn was in March. Safe to say their moves to Europe have not panned out in terms of actual minutes played, despite the experiences of being overseas. It's good to see the U23 program work in both directions between senior call-ups and continued development. Wesley is a centerback who started in the U23s in 2025 but aged out later in the year. She eventually earned senior call-ups to close out 2025. Though that might look different now that Girma is healthier and back in the mix. Wingback Gisele Thompson had a promising start to the year but missed out on camps due to injury, and she might be one of those \"ready later vs. ready now\" type of players Hayes had referred to in the past.\nMidfielders: Ally SentnorA revamped U23 program means that players who could use more development have a place to do that outside of their clubs. After call-ups with the senior team, a midseason move from Utah to Kansas City changed the way Sentnor was utilized. It meant that a sophomore NWSL player was now on a club depth chart instead of the face of a team to end the NWSL season. She was part of the U23 side that recently defeated England, 4-2, and she scored a goal in the second half. Don't be surprised if her extra minutes and overseason experience boost her back into the senior mix.Forwards: Emma SearsI don't truly believe Sears is on the outside, so let's make that clear. There's just an abundance of attacking players in this program now, and only so many spaces on a World Cup qualifying roster. A lot will depend on the availability of \"triple espresso\" come November 2026, and even then, Thompson, Macario, and Cooper are forwards who might be in front of her on the depth chart. \n            ",

Right-hander Dylan Cease agreed to a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Blue Jays on Thanksgiving Eve. It's tied for the fourth-largest deal in terms of total money among active pitchers, and is a big boost for the reigning AL champs. While there's no Aaron Judge or Juan Soto on the market this winter, there's plenty of top talent still available. Kyle Tucker, a four-time All-Star who will turn 29 in January, leads the list, and though his second half left much to be desired, he could be a huge asset for any team. Alex Bregman was left on the market until late last winter but he showed no ill effects, putting up a 128 OPS+. On the pitching side, Framber Valdez and Ranger Suárez could frontline almost any rotation.Josh Naylor became the first notable hitter to ink a new deal this offseason, heading back to Seattle in the winter's first major free agency deal. He's re-signing with the Mariners on a five-year, $92.5 million deal.

    "body": "\n        The Giannis Antetokounmpo sweepstakes are here. Well, not here, here. We're still doing the \"meeting to discuss his future\" dance, according to ESPN, but to be frank, that song has been playing for months. The Bucks are 9-13. They just lost to the Wizards. They have very few future draft picks to trade. They have $20 million in dead Damian Lillard money for the next five years. This is not a team capable of genuine championship in the near future. If the Giannis era isn't dead in Milwaukee, it's at least on life support.So that's enough preamble. Yet again, Antetokounmpo has seemingly soft-launched his trade request. That can only happen so many times before a trade materializes. So what does the market look like if and when the move happens for real? Below, we're going to rank all 29 non-Milwaukee teams as possible Antetokounmpo destinations. Teams will be ranked on how much they have to give up for him, how interested he would be in playing for them (as he can become a free agent in 2027), and how interested these teams would be in acquiring him. So without further ado, let's begin.Tier XI: He's not re-signing there29. Sacramento Kings28. Charlotte Hornets27. Washington Wizards26. Utah Jazz25. Memphis GrizzliesWe won't waste much time here. Congratulations to the Kings on being the least desirable team for an MVP-caliber player in the NBA. It's a title they've held for much of the past two decades. They're bad, they're poorly run and they play in a small market. The Hornets are bad and in a small market, but they're at least seemingly operated like a normal franchise now. The same goes for the Wizards, but Washington is more desirable than Charlotte.\nIt's a shame about Utah and Memphis, because they're both pretty interesting basketball situations. Antetokounmpo and Lauri Markkanen would be fun teammates, and the Jazz have a bunch of draft picks to trade. Memphis has the infrastructure for an Antetokounmpo team: a stretch big (Jaren Jackson Jr.), defensive-minded wings (Cedric Cowards, Jaylen Wells) and guards who can shoot (Ty Jerome and Scotty Pippen Jr.). The Grizzlies could send back Ja Morant, Zach Edey and picks. Of course, if Kevin Durant and Jimmy Butler didn't want to go to Memphis, it's hard to imagine Antetokounmpo would either, especially in the West. Very few players ever want to relocate to Utah, though plenty find themselves pleasantly surprised once they've gotten there. Tier X: They don't have enough to trade24. Phoenix Suns23. Minnesota Timberwolves22. Denver Nuggets21. Dallas Mavericks20. Los Angeles ClippersThe Suns are probably comfortable sitting out of the star trade market for the next few years, considering how poorly their last few forays into it went. It's ironic. If they hadn't traded for Kevin Durant and just played out the last few years organically, they'd be a perfect fit for Antetokounmpo. He and Devin Booker make a lot of sense as teammates. As it stands, a team with no picks and few notable players just isn't getting into the mix here.\nMinnesota and Denver are slightly plausible teams when it comes to Antetokounmpo's own interest. I'm sure he'd love to play with Anthony Edwards or Nikola Jokić. But what are they giving up? There isn't another All-Star on either roster, and both teams have spent all of their picks. They're out.Okay, Dallas does have enough to trade. But the Mavericks aren't giving away Cooper Flagg, and without him, this is a team mostly devoid of youth and picks. Their best-case scenario would be trading Anthony Davis for a pile of assets they could then flip for Antetokounmpo, but who on Earth is eager to trade for Davis while Antetokounmpo is available? Davis just isn't worth enough to get this done. The Mavericks are yet another \"if only they hadn't made that other big trade\" team. If Nico Harrison was just a bit more patient, he might have been able to turn Luka Dončić into Antetokounmpo. That still would've been a bad trade, but it would have been slightly more defensible.The Clippers have meticulously cleared their cap space to pursue star free agents in the coming offseasons, but they've done that primarily because they have nothing to trade. Free agency is their only path to another star, and given their poor performance and the looming Kawhi Leonard investigation, they're probably not luring a player of this caliber there anyway. If Antetokounmpo wants to go to Los Angeles, why wouldn't he just sign with the Lakers? \nTier IX: Respectfully bowing out19. Oklahoma City ThunderThey're 21-1. They have the best net rating in NBA history. There's no reason to mess with this roster. Honestly, the best rationale Oklahoma City would have for trading for Antetokounmpo would be to keep him away from the field. They don't need him, but they don't want to play against him, either. That isn't a good enough reason to actually trade for him, but don't be surprised if they leak some minor interest to try to drive up the price. If a rival is going to get Antetokounmpo, the Thunder want to be sure they pay full price for him.Tier VIII: Facilitator tier18. New Orleans Pelicans17. Portland Trail BlazersNew Orleans controls the best possible outcomes for Milwaukee's 2027 first-round pick. That makes them a possible facilitator here, though there's no chance Antetokounmpo actually joins the Pelicans. Trades of this magnitude almost always involve three or more teams, so keep an eye on New Orleans as a supporting part of the deal.Portland is slightly more interesting. The Blazers control Milwaukee's first-round picks in 2028, 2029 and 2030 thanks to the Damian Lillard trade. The Bucks would probably love to get those picks back so they can tank properly and rebuild on their own timeline. That makes Portland an obvious facilitator, but the concept of the Blazers getting in the mix for Antetokounmpo himself isn't crazy either. They have multiple former teammates of his in Lillard and Jrue Holiday. Deni Avdija is growing into a star who would fit quite well beside Antetokounmpo, and the Blazers still have plenty of youth to deal in players like Scoot Henderson, Shaedon Sharpe and Donovan Clingan. It would probably be a tough sell for him to move to a Western Conference team that's currently far below .500, but they're an interesting sleeper.\nTier VII: How attached are you to your stars?16. Boston Celtics15. Philadelphia 76ers14. Orlando MagicIn a cold, rational world, Jayson Tatum for Giannis Antetokounmpo actually makes a ton of sense. The Celtics could immediately jump back into championship contention. The Bucks could get a true superstar with a long-term contract back for the one who's leaving, tank out the rest of this season, get the lesser of two pretty valuable picks (their own and New Orleans'), and then immediately try to trade that pick for more help for Tatum. But this isn't a cold, rational world. It's the real one. The Celtics wouldn't trade Tatum for anything. That's bigger than basketball. He's their guy. He's won them a championship. So a Celtics trade would have to revolve around Jaylen Brown, and it's just hard to imagine that would be enough to entice the Bucks. Maybe if Derrick White is attached as well, but that would leave the Celtics with two MVP candidates, one of whom is coming off of a torn Achilles, and a very thin supporting cast beyond them. That's just never been how they operate, so the Celtics are a long shot.Tyrese Maxey is going to get MVP votes. He and VJ Edgecombe have a remarkably bright future together. The albatross contracts Philadelphia gave to Paul George and Joel Embiid could very easily ruin that future. The 76ers are so deep at guard that they could plausibly talk themselves into building an offer around Edgecombe and picks (including some increasingly valuable Clipper picks) if it meant not only getting Antetokounmpo, but getting off of one of those huge contracts. Could a team built around Maxey, Antetokounmpo and Quentin Grimes, perhaps with George still on in a supporting role, win the East? Absolutely. But Daryl Morey cold threw cold water on a very hot seat by drafting Edgecombe in the first place. Does he really want to turn the heat back up by going all-in again? The answer is probably no. There will be easier ways to address those giant contracts, ideally when a bit more time has ticked off of them.A few weeks ago, the Magic might have been open to flipping Franz Wagner or Paolo Banchero for Giannis. They've since righted the ship, winning eight of their last 10. But man, the ingredients are here: a high-level scoring guard (Desmond Bane), a big man who can shoot (Wendell Carter Jr.) and an ace perimeter defender (Jalen Suggs). The Bucks would probably want Banchero, but his contract is far more difficult to move. It has a poison pill thanks to the extension he signed over the summer, whereas Wagner just has a big cap number that could cover most of the salary-matching requirements. Banchero would have to be dealt alongside several teammates. But Wagner has flat out been the better player of the two this season. If the Bucks see a potential future star there, maybe they'd be open to a deal centered around him, Orlando's last tradable first-round pick (in 2032) and rapidly ascending young guard Anthony Black. Would the Magic rather be the Eastern Conference favorites here and now, or keep their youth and flexibility for a longer run? That's the question. I expect the answer to be the latter.\nTier VI: Right market, wrong time13. Chicago Bulls12. Brooklyn NetsLast week, a report by ESPN suggested that the Bulls are trying to emulate the Pacers. They think they have their Tyrese Haliburton in Josh Giddey, and now they want their Pascal Siakam. Well, Antetokounmpo could be a supercharged version of Siakam, and Nikola Vučević's shooting would obviously pair nicely with a downhill force like Giannis. The Bulls have Matas Buzelis and all of their picks at their disposal. They could make a competitive offer. But would they really be contenders after a trade like that? Not with their current defense, and frankly, Antetokounmpo has always needed a better offensive teammate than Giddey as well. Giddey is a transition force, but like Antetokounmpo, isn't a traditional half-court creator for late in games. It's tempting, but the Bulls just aren't good enough.The Nets emphatically aren't good enough. That was never the point. Antetokounmpo has been linked to them for so long because they have two things: assets and the right market. The idea would be to land Antetokounmpo, use the remainder of your trade assets on another star and go from there. If this supporting cast had meaningfully developed any youth, that would be tempting. But the truth here is, this team isn't two stars away. There are still too many questions about the supporting cast, especially since so much of the meager incumbent talent would presumably be traded. If the Nets had drafted a star last year or done a better job of cultivating longer-term, starter-level depth, this would be a conversation. The timing just isn't right here. If Antetokounmpo wanted to wait a few more years, he wouldn't be rattling this cage in December. That this is happening now suggests that he wants to contend for the 2026 title. That isn't happening in Brooklyn.Tier V: And the gold medal in cap gymnastics goes to...11. Cleveland CavaliersIt would be functionally impossible for the Cavaliers to do this without gutting their team. They're $22 million above the second apron, and they can't aggregate salary unless they get below it. They'd have to do so because no one on their team makes as much as Antetokounmpo, and their first apron restrictions mean they can't take in more salary than they send out in a trade. They're not gutting their team for Anthony Davis or one of the guards floating around. But Antetokounmpo? That's at least worth the conversation, right? Say Evan Mobley, the 24-year-old reigning Defensive Player of the Year, would suffice as a return for the Bucks. He makes around $8 million less than Antetokounmpo does, so the Cavaliers would have to send out another $30 million or so to make the math work. That's two of Jarrett Allen, Max Strus and De'Andre Hunter, though they could take back some more salary, and they'd have to send someone to another team who could absorb the money. If the two sides are motivated enough here, there's a potential deal in which the Bucks send both Antetokounmpo and Turner to Cleveland for Mobley, take back two of the role players and send the third into Brooklyn's cap space. Immensely complicated, but doable. Cleveland probably isn't ready to take that sort of plunge, but hey, Koby Altman has made aggressive moves in the past. It's hard to imagine he won't at least consider something like this. \nTier IV: Are you willing to gamble on a rental?10. Toronto Raptors9. Indiana Pacers8. Atlanta HawksToronto was linked to Antetokounmpo for years when Masai Ujiri ran the team. He's now gone, but the team is playing better than it has in quite some time. Of course, that doesn't seem sustainable at least on a postseason level. The Raptors dominate in transition and with their bench units, two traits that tend not to translate especially well to the playoffs, and they've played the fourth-easiest schedule in the league to date. The Raptors won a championship renting Kawhi Leonard. Ujiri was the general manager who made that trade, but everyone in the building surely remembers it. Toronto has all of its picks to trade and a deep group of supporting pieces. They'd probably need to add more shooting either in this deal or a separate one, but this is the sort of team that should be considering a high-risk, high-reward rental. They have no championship upside otherwise.The Pacers obviously do. They also have bad blood with Antetokounmpo amid a rivalry that has developed over the past few seasons. But who cares? If Chris Paul can play for the Warriors, anyone can play for anyone. Aside from fitting into Indiana's up-tempo style, the concept of adding a high-usage star might actually appeal to the Pacers as a way to ease Tyrese Haliburton back into the lineup next year. Indiana could build a package around Pascal Siakam and a bunch of draft picks, including this year's pick, which looks very valuable at the moment, but becomes less so if Indiana traded for Giannis. A move like this would be pretty out of character for the Pacers, who are a fairly conservative organization, but how many chances do you get to trade for an MVP? A move like this could give them control of the Eastern Conference for several years. They have to at least consider it, especially with so much uncertainty in their front court following Turner's departure.The Hawks technically control Milwaukee's 2026 first-round pick, though they are far likelier to get the even better New Orleans pick in the upcoming draft. They also sort of control Milwaukee's 2027 pick. They get the lesser of Milwaukee's and New Orleans' picks next year, provided they aren't both in the top four. Considering both teams will probably be bad, but the odds of both picks winding up in the top four is low, that's going to be a pretty good pick if it conveys. The question here is what sort of timeline Atlanta wants to operate under. They're now 12-5 without Trae Young. This team of young, athletic wings is thriving, and that 2026 New Orleans pick gives them a shot at a franchise player on a rookie deal. There's a world in which the Hawks have a decade of contention ahead of them. Do they want to mess with that to potentially become Eastern Conference favorites for a shorter period? What would the trade even look like? Young has long-needed a star big like Antetokounmpo as a teammate to protect him defensively, but would Antetokounmpo want to play with someone so ball-dominant? Would the Bucks want Young? Would they demand that incredible Pelicans pick, and would the Hawks give it up? Jalen Johnson is the best player on the team. He also clashes stylistically a fair bit with Giannis, though his improvement as a shooter this year is notable. You could construct half a dozen viable trade packages here. It's just a matter of how interested Antetokounmpo would be in the Hawks, and how eager Atlanta would be to fast forward through the early portion of this (very promising) retool.\nTier III: Old Money7. Miami Heat6. Golden State Warriors5. Los Angeles LakersAgents love packaging their best clients. Antetokounmpo is represented by Alex Saratsis, whose second-best client happens to be Bam Adebayo. That means he would probably be off-limits, but anything else the Heat could offer would be on the table. Miami's pick situation is a tad complicated, as the 2027 pick they owe Charlotte rules out their 2026 or 2028 picks in trades thanks to the Stepien Rule. However, the Heat could dangle swap rights in 2026, 2028, 2030 and 2032 along with outright picks in 2029 and 2031. Not a bad start from a draft perspective, especially since the Bucks already owe swaps in three of those years. Kel'El Ware has All-Star upside, and Tyler Herro is an actual All-Star from Wisconsin. Is this the best trade package we've covered here? No. But what the player and agent want usually means quite a bit in these situations, and the Heat will probably be on Antetokounmpo's list.The Warriors have been eyeing Antetokounmpo for years. Well, the Warriors have been eyeing everyone for years. No team draws more \"is monitoring star X\" reports than they do, but hey, when you have Stephen Curry as a selling point, it makes sense to shoot for the stars. The Warriors have most of their picks to dangle. They'd have to work around the top-20 protected 2030 pick they owe the Wizards, but that's doable. The Warriors can still trade the valuable portion of that pick as well as all of their others, and the notion of deep future Warriors picks, which will presumably convey after Curry retires, is probably pretty appealing to the Bucks. The bigger question here is matching salary. The Warriors could easily match money with Jimmy Butler, who is conveniently a dollar-for-dollar match with Giannis. The Bucks wouldn't want Butler, though, so he'd have to go to a third team. If last year's saga taught us anything, it's that he'd be particularly about which teams he'd be willing to go to. There's another version of this deal built around Draymond Green, Jonathan Kuminga and more salary, but aside from giving away a franchise icon, it would mean gutting the team's depth. This would take some negotiation, but if Antetokounmpo wants the Warriors, they're a viable destination.The Lakers would have been a laughable Giannis destination a year ago. Two things have happened since. First, we were reminded of Lakers Exceptionalism when they swiped Luka Dončić for pennies on the dollar. Second, Austin Reaves has ascended into clear All-Star status. He is a viable centerpiece for a trade like this now, but there are still a few problems. The first is salary. He makes only around $14 million. That means the Lakers could have to add another $40 million or so just to make the money work. They have the contracts to do so, but it would cost them most of their depth. Second, Reaves is an impending unrestricted free agent who is basically impossible to extend given his low 2026 cap number. That means the Bucks would have to hope he'd be willing to re-sign over the summer, when several more desirable cap space teams could come knocking. Is that a risk they're willing to take? \nAnd then there's the matter of draft compensation. The Lakers can trade only one first-round pick now, in either 2031 or 2032. Over the summer, that figure jumps to three, but Reaves will be a free agent by then. He'd have to cooperate in a sign-and-trade, which he'd have no incentive to do. So really, the Lakers would have to hope that Reaves could be sold on a future in Milwaukee and that the Bucks would be amenable to a deal in which they received only one pick outright along with several swaps. Feasible? Only if Antetokounmpo forces the issue. Stars do that for the Lakers all of the time. We have no indication yet that he will be one of them. Remember, even if the Lakers don't actually get Antetokounmpo, they're still a meaningful player in these negotiations. They're the boogeyman, the team with 2027 cap space that Giannis would be able to point to in order to scare off unwanted suitors. \"Trade for me and I'll sign with the Lakers.\" That might not get him to Los Angeles or anywhere, but it's going to be a factor in how all of this plays out.Tier II: Nouveau Riche4. Detroit Pistons3. Houston Rockets2. San Antonio SpursThese are the teams that the Bucks want to trade with. They have the most assets. They are all capable of winning the championship with Antetokounmpo here and now, provided they can keep most of their current core. Considering the youth and picks all three have to trade, that shouldn't be a problem. The issue at play isn't whether or not they can trade for Giannis. It's whether or not they should want to. All three are so early into their windows. All three are positioned to win for a long time, to have more bites at the apple, and to perhaps take those bites in years in which Oklahoma City isn't quite this dominant, that they might prefer not to go all-in for a 31-year-old that has dealt with nagging injuries and has a playing style that is pretty reliant on athleticism.The Pistons have all of their own picks to trade, but how valuable would picks from an Antetokounmpo-Cade Cunningham team really be? They'd have to send substantial player value as well. Their two best assets, aside from Cunningham, are Jalen Duren and Ausar Thompson. Both, as non-shooters, are iffy fits next to Antetokounmpo anyway. But Duren is a 22-year-old possible first-time All-Star, and Thompson is one of the best athletes in the entire league. You could argue that they cumulatively have the potential to give the Pistons the same things Giannis would. Detroit is already a dominant rim team, scoring more points in the paint than anyone in the league while allowing the fourth-fewest. Could Detroit get away with sending one of them alongside former lottery pick Jaden Ivey, who's seemingly getting usurped in the pecking order by Daniss Jenkins? Maybe, but the Pistons still rank 28th in the NBA in 3-point attempt rate. They'd have to change a lot of what they do offensively to suit Antetokounmpo. Is that worth it for a 17-4 team with a long runway ahead of it?\nPretty much everything I just wrote about the Pistons applies to the Rockets. They even have a Thompson twin they'd prefer not to trade and a young star center in Alperen Sengun. They'd have an easier time trading for Antetokounmpo considering all of the valuable, external picks they control (most notably from Phoenix), but their salary structure is far less forgiving than Detroit's. The Rockets are pressed up against their first-apron hard cap, and unless Kevin Durant is in the deal, they'd have to include multiple big contracts to make the money work. Fred VanVleet's cap figure helps, but remember, he has the right to veto any trade. Jabari Smith has a poison pill that makes him difficult to trade, and Reed Sheppard would have to stay solely to give Antetokounmpo some shooting to work with. It would be an extraordinarily difficult trade to construct, likely centered around Sengun, and it would mean breaking up a team that currently ranks third in defense, second in offense and first in rebounding. Considering Durant's age, the Rockets would be pushing a ton of chips in for the next couple of years, when the Thunder will presumably be at their strongest. Is that really wise?Of these three teams, San Antonio is probably the best-positioned for balance. They have two possible star guards on rookie deals in Dylan Harper and Stephon Castle. They can probably afford to trade one, especially since neither of them nor De'Aaron Fox are star shooters. Victor Wembanyama might be the best player in the league for the next decade or more. He might have injury issues that compromise San Antonio's long-term plans. The Spurs have accumulated enough draft value, particularly in the form of swaps, to keep adding cheap youth even after making a trade of this magnitude. Wembanyama and Antetokounmpo would be the best rim-protecting duo in the NBA, maybe even in history. Their skill sets mesh reasonably well, and the Spurs probably wouldn't mind lowering Wembanyama's usage a bit to protect his body. The Spurs are below the tax and still two seasons away from Wembanyama's inevitable max extension. They're financially flexible, and they're 14-6. They clearly think they're ready to at least be competitive in the playoffs now. With Giannis, that ceiling only gets raised higher. The Spurs, like the Rockets and Pistons, could absolutely justify sitting these talks out and playing the long game. But they have more to gain in the short term, and thanks to the presence of arguably the best 21-year-old the league has ever seen, less to lose in the long term by making this deal.Tier I: The heart wants what it wants1. New York KnicksWhen Antetokounmpo explored a trade over the summer, his preferred destination was New York. The Knicks are the only team known to have discussed a trade with Milwaukee before the season started. When a star wants to go somewhere specific, he can make things very uncomfortable for other suitors. Remember how we covered the Lakers as a boogeyman? If Giannis wants to be a Knick badly enough, he'll use the Lakers to scare any other team off. The Clippers and Nets could serve that same function. He's not short on leverage, as Damian Lillard was with three guaranteed years left on his deal when he tried to force his way to Miami in 2023.So Antetokounmpo has control. The question is how much of it he's willing to exert. The Knicks don't come close to having the best trade package. Right now, they don't have a single, guaranteed first-round pick to deal. They have Washington's pick this year... except it's top-eight protected and becomes second-rounders when it inevitably doesn't convey. They can offer swaps in even-numbered years, which is again valuable as the Bucks owe swaps to other teams in 2026, 2028 and 2030 already. But that only gets them so far. The bulk of the value here would have to come through players.And that's where things get difficult. All of New York's best players are in their late 20s or early 30s. What would the Bucks really be building if they traded Antetokounmpo for Karl-Anthony Towns and Mikal Bridges? A 40-win team that could hang around the Play-In Tournament as they wait out all of the future draft picks they owe other teams? That's not exactly appealing. Maybe they could flip those veterans for picks elsewhere, but they wouldn't net close to the amount a player of Antetokounmpo's caliber typically should. There are minor negotiating points here. The Knicks would rather keep OG Anunoby than Bridges. They'd love to hold onto Deuce McBride. The Bucks would justifiably start negotiations by demanding everything the Knicks could offer. Even New York's best package would be pretty underwhelming. If Bridges is involved, it would also be pretty time-consuming. He isn't eligible for a trade until Feb. 1 thanks to the extension he signed over the summer.What would the Knicks be with Antetokounmpo? That's hard to say. They'd almost certainly be better. Having two of the 10 best players in the NBA is a pretty good starting point. But a lot of their role players, most notably Josh Hart and Mitchell Robinson, make more sense on a Towns team because of their limitations as shooters. Could the Knicks make follow-up trades to rebalance the roster? Or would their talent be overwhelming enough to win in spite of those weaknesses? Could they convince the Bucks to take the players they'd no longer need in exchange for different supporting pieces? Milwaukee likely won't be too eager to do New York any favors if this comes to pass.The Bucks don't want to trade with the Knicks. They want to trade with the Pistons, Spurs or Rockets. It just may not be up to them. If Antetokounmpo forces their hand and no viable rental alternative emerges, there's a good chance this ends with the Knicks getting a two-time MVP at a bargain-basement price.\n            ",

The civil suit involving an alleged incident at a 2023 NBA Finals game was dismissed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, according to ESPN.The female plaintiff voluntarily filed for dismissal on Tuesday. The voluntary dismissal was filed with prejudice, meaning no further litigation can be brought forward. McGregor had denied all allegations against him and no criminal charges were pursued by the Florida State Attorney's Office in the case.The woman, described in the lawsuit as a 49-year-old business executive, accused McGregor of sexual assault during Game 4 of the series between the Miami Heat and Denver Nuggets in June 2023 at the Kaseya Center in Miami. The alleged assault took place in the men's restroom near the Courtside Club inside the arena, which is the home of the Heat. The plaintiff filed a civil suit against McGregor and the Heat in January.Last November, a High Court jury in Ireland found McGregor civilly liable in a separate sexual assault case. McGregor was ordered to pay approximately $258,300 to Nikita Hand. Earlier this year, Ireland's High Court dismissed McGregor's appeal. \nMcGregor, a former two-division UFC champion, has not competed in mixed martial arts since sustaining a broken leg against Dustin Poirier in July 2021. McGregor is currently campaigning for a comeback fight at the White House card this summer.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Wide receiver Adam Thielen's representation approached the Minnesota Vikings about releasing him, as the 35-year-old wideout wanted to play a larger role in an offense in what will be his final NFL season. Thielen, after being waived Monday, will get a chance to do just that after being claimed by the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday.The Vikings traded for Thielen prior to the start of the regular season, as their wide receiving corps was hit hard by injuries. However, in 11 games played this year, Thielen caught just eight passes for 69 yards. He was made a healthy scratch this past week, as the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0.In Pittsburgh, Thielen joins a wide receiving corps headlined by DK Metcalf, although he is the only pass-catcher to cross 300 yards receiving this season. In Thielen, Aaron Rodgers acquires a veteran playmaker that can move the chains.\n\"I was joking with him, he said this is the best his body has felt because he hasn't been playing a whole lot in Minnesota,\" Rodgers said following Wednesday's practice. \"So I think he's got a lot left in the tank and a lot of impetus to go out there and put some good play on film.\"\n        \n            \n                Mike Tomlin on hot seat?

Thielen, in his 12th NFL season, was picked up by the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013 and ended up playing nine years for the team. He ranks fourth in franchise history in receptions (542), fifth in receiving yards (6,751) and third in receiving touchdowns (55).\nThe 6-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North race. The Baltimore Ravens, also at 6-6, own the tiebreaker, while the 4-8 Cincinnati Bengals are lurking in the background with Joe Burrow back in the fold. Pittsburgh has a 44.8% chance to win the division, and 45.1% chance to make the playoffs, according to SportsLine data expert Stephen Oh. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- After a full day of trade rumors, there are more immediate concerns about the future of Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo after he collapsed with a non-contact injury minutes into the team's 113-109 win over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. The Bucks announced that Antetokounmpo suffered a right calf strain and he did not return to the game. Bucks coach Doc Rivers did not have an update on Antetokounmpo's status after the game, but did say that he thinks the medical staff has \"ruled out\" an Achilles injury. \"He's doing an MRI right now, so we'll know more hopefully by the end of [Wednesday night],\" Rivers said. \"I didn't know what it was. I just wanted the trainers to tend to him. Right when they brought him in they took him to the hospital.\" Just under three minutes into the first quarter, Antetokounmpo drove along the baseline and found a cutting AJ Green for an easy layup. As he turned to run back up the floor, he suddenly fell and immediately motioned to the bench for help. He remained seated on the floor until Kevin Porter Jr. took a foul to stop play. \nAntetokounmpo was then helped to his feet and was able to walk off the court under his own power. He initially took a seat on the bench, but later made his way to the locker room. Footage from the Bucks' broadcast showed him walking through the tunnel on his own, but moving very slowly. It's too early to say how long Antetokounmpo may be sidelined, but his initial reaction was concerning. He will need to undergo imaging to fully assess the injury and establish a timeline. Regardless, this is a major blow for a Bucks team that, despite their surprise win Wednesday, is still only 2-5 without their two-time MVP this season and has sunk to 10th place in the Eastern Conference at 10-13. \n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo trade destinations: Ranking all 29 landing spots with Knicks as the clear No. 1\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAntetokounmpo missed nearly two weeks earlier this season with a left groin strain. He does have a previous history of calf issues. In 2024, he strained the soleus muscle in his left calf just before the end of the regular season and missed the team's entire first-round playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, which they lost in six games. Last season, he sat out the All-Star Game and missed nearly three weeks with a left calf strain. \nEntering Wednesday, Antetokounmpo was averaging 30.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 6.4 assists on 63.9% shooting. He was fourth in the league in scoring, fifth in rebounds and seventh in field goal percentage, and was on pace to average 30/10/5 for the fourth consecutive season (every other player in NBA history combined has eight such seasons). Antetokounmpo was well on his way to a 10th consecutive All-Star appearance and eighth consecutive All-NBA First Team honor. A lengthy absence could put both of those streaks in jeopardy. With the league's new 65-game threshold for major awards, Antetokounmpo would be ineligible for honors such as MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA if he misses 12 more games. Prior to Wednesday's game, ESPN reported that Antetokounmpo and his agent are in the process of discussing his future with the Bucks. A resolution was reportedly expected in the coming weeks, but this injury may disrupt any potential trade talks. \nBucks coach Doc Rivers refuted the idea that Antetokounmpo has asked out of Milwaukee. \"Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever. I can't make that more clear,\" Rivers said before Wednesday's game. \"The thing I keep saying is I go to the source. I talk to the source every single day. Every single day. He loves Milwaukee and he loves the Bucks,\" Rivers continued. \"I've heard guys say they've talked to sources. I talked to the source. If I've learned anything in life, the source usually knows.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.                 We can take some educated guesses based on coaches film, meaningful data, healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records, and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.                  We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to sit Elic Ayomanor). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

Detroit might try to counter that with its run game, but Dallas' run defense has been pretty awesome since acquiring Quinnen Williams: 3.3 yards per carry, zero touchdowns, and a skimpy 2.8% explosive rush rate allowed. That should make you nervous about David Montgomery (6.3 carries per game in his past three), but nothing should keep you from starting Jahmyr Gibbs. I would expect a heavy workload for Jared Goff, which would normally be great, but he figures to be without Amon-Ra St. Brown. That still shouldn't keep him from finding around 24 Fantasy points, something 10 of 12 passers have done against Dallas this season, including 30-burgers to Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes in their past two games.  The good news is that Isaac TeSlaa's route participation was already on the rise even without St. Brown's Week 13 injury; his 97% number in Week 13 was a career high. The bad news is that his added routes didn't result in a high target rate -- he's been under 7% in each of his past three, including Thanksgiving day when he ran clear-out routes on plenty of snaps. That's not good. Desperation due to injuries will push him into a larger role, but Tom Kennedy figures to also get more opportunities as the primary slot replacement for St. Brown. Kennedy seemed to be an easy short-area target that Goff wasn't shy to lean into last week: Kennedy didn't run as much as one route before Week 13, and his route rate was lower than TeSlaa's, yet he saw twice as many targets and proved he could run past defenders to earn a target. I kind of like Kennedy in deeper PPR leagues, and I like TeSlaa in all formats, but only in reasonable instances over any wideout that doesn't carry much upside and has a tougher matchup. Neither should be started with high expectations.   MUST STARTS: Jahmyr Gibbs, Dak Prescott, George Pickens, CeeDee Lamb STARTS: Jared Goff, Jameson Williams, Javonte Williams, Jake Ferguson (borderline TE) \nFLEX: Isaac TeSlaa and Tom Kennedy (both in sort-of desperation situations) SITS: David Montgomery (at best a non-PPR flex), Ross Dwelley, Malik Davis, Ryan Flournoy, Cowboys DST, Lions DST \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nMUST-STARTS: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Bijan Robinson STARTS: Kenneth Walker III, Kyle Pitts, Seahawks DST FLEX: Zach Charbonnet, Tyler Allgeier (non-PPR) SITS: Sam Darnold, Kirk Cousins, Darnell Mooney (desperation WR), Cooper Kupp, Rashid Shaheed, A.J.

Jackson's completion rate has gone off the rails (under 59% in four straight), and his catchable pass rate has gone under 80% in each of his past two games. The combined lack of accuracy, along with his lack of rushing dominance, has made him a Fantasy liability. Is it a silver lining that he had one touchdown called back by a penalty and another fumbled out of the end zone by Isaiah Likely last week? Or is it a real problem that Jackson has officially not thrown a touchdown since Week 10? The Steelers have long played aggressive defense against Jackson and figure to do the same thing this week with a lot of man-to-man coverage and a lot of blitzing. Since his return from injury in Week 9, Jackson has completed 42.5% of his passes against man-to-man for 6.8 yards per attempt with an egregious 35% off-target throw rate; the completion and yardage rates get even worse when he's pressured. This is a tough spot to trust Jackson, especially since there's a real chance the Ravens can run their way to victory, given the state of the Steelers run defense, which might have a sub-100 percent Patrick Queen at linebacker and definitely won't have Derrick Harmon on the D-line.  \nMUST STARTS: Derrick Henry STARTS: Jaylen Warren (borderline No. 2/3 PPR RB), Ravens DST, Steelers DST FLEX: Kenneth Gainwell (low-end flex), DK Metcalf (low-end flex) SITS: Lamar Jackson (high-end No. 2 QB), Aaron Rodgers, Kenneth Gainwell (desperation RB), Calvin Austin III, Adam Thielen, Pat Freiermuth, Darnell Washington, Roman Wilson,  \n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nIn the Bills' blowout wins this season, Khalil Shakir's route participation rate has never been higher than 71.4% and as low as the 51.9% rate last week. That doesn't preclude him from being bad for Fantasy -- he had a 6-88-1 stat line Week 8 at Carolina -- but three of his four single-digit PPR point games did come in Bills blowout wins. This week doesn't feel like a blowout win for Buffalo, not after how the Bengals came out last Thursday and throttled the Ravens. But it does feel like a really good matchup for James Cook and thus a lesser need for Josh Allen to throw all over the place. It is worth noting that Shakir's metrics are much better against zone coverage than man-to-man, and the Bengals have been playing more man-to-man coverage over their past three games. Shakir remains flex-worthy, especially in PPR, but that's it.

Some of that is a function of the weak offenses they've played, some of it can be attributed to an emerging pass rush that's scored 12 sacks in their past three games, even without blitzing a ton. Indianapolis should aim to manage those pass rush issues, given its O-line and Daniel Jones' recent efforts to get the ball out faster over his past two games. If Jones could connect several times with Alec Pierce on downfield throws against Houston, then he should be able to do the same against Jacksonville, especially since Houston was as good as Jacksonville at defending deep throws going into last week. Pierce's upside is what makes him a must-start in Fantasy, while Jones is more of a low-end starter because he should be able to match or slightly exceed the 20 Fantasy points he's had in his past two games against tougher matchups.  \nJakobi Meyers has led the Jaguars in target per route run rate versus man coverage since joining the team four games ago. Before his arrival, that title belonged to Parker Washington. (Brian Thomas Jr. narrowly led with a 22.5% target per route run rate versus zone coverage.) If the Colts stick with playing a good dose of man-to-man coverage like they did last week, even after Sauce Gardner's injury, then Meyers should have a shot at a good game. Indy began the year playing a good amount of zone coverage, but altered course midseason and then traded for Gardner. Additionally, defensive boss Lou Anarumo leaned on a sizable amount of man-to-man coverage in two career meetings against Trevor Lawrence, beating him both times. This should encourage you to trust Meyers as at least a flex, especially if Parker Washington doesn't play.  MUST STARTS: Jonathan Taylor STARTS: Daniel Jones (borderline No. 1/2 QB), Travis Etienne, Alec Pierce, Michael Pittman (low-end No. 2 PPR WR), Tyler Warren, Brenton Strange, Jaguars DST  FLEX: Jakobi Meyers, Brian Thomas Jr. (low-end flex) SITS: Trevor Lawrence (high-end No. 2 QB), Josh Downs (desperation PPR WR), Bhayshul Tuten, Colts DST \n\n                    \n                Start 'em\n            \n                \n            \n                10.0-7.00\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                6.99 - 5.01\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                5.00 - 0\n            \n        \n                    \n                Sit 'em\n            \n            \nIn six games with J.J. McCarthy, Justin Jefferson has topped 15 PPR points once (Week 9) and 12 PPR points twice (Week 1), thanks to touchdowns he's caught. McCarthy is clearly problematic, but at least he knows to feed Jefferson the ball, given the receiver's 26.2% target per route run rate with McCarthy. Since Dan Quinn took over the playcalling duties for the Commanders defense, he's dialed up a lot of zone coverage and thus given up fewer deep completions. Because it looks like left tackle Christian Darrisaw is going to play, I'm willing to overlook other Vikings O-line deficiencies in what is otherwise a great matchup for them. If McCarthy focuses on making quick and easy decisions, then at least Jefferson should get good volume and be usable as a No. 2 receiver (just not a No. 1).  Why start Chris Rodriguez if he's a TD-or-bust running back? Simple: The Vikings have allowed at least one rushing touchdown to a running back in six straight games (six RBs and seven touchdowns total). Of the six RBs who scored, four had at least 12 carries; Rodriguez has 11 carries in three of his past four and has seemingly earned a role as the team's lead running-downs back. Start him as a touchdown-based flex or low-end RB, making him better in non-PPR than PPR formats.

They mostly fixed it in Week 13, putting Mitchell on the Fantasy radar against an evolving Dolphins defense that's rapidly improved against the run and is slowly improving against the pass. Their metrics against deep passes to WRs are awesome because they've barely been tested (50 targets of 15-plus air yards are the second-fewest any team has seen this year; they've allowed six scores on deep throws, though, bottom-10 in the league). Mitchell has eight targets of 15-plus air yards in his past two with Taylor. I'd be shocked if the Jets didn't try more of them, especially if they don't have much success stopping the Dolphins run game and are forced to throw. Plus, it's not like Mitchell doesn't get short targets either, catching 8 of 11 throws inside of 15 air yards in his past two games for 76 yards. It makes Mitchell a flex worth rolling the dice on.

Thank goodness for the touchdowns ... and for the receiving skills (seven targets, six catches, 47 yards). Harvey had fewer hesitations in his runs last week than the week before, but dealt with a lot of bad blocking from his offensive line and still didn't win on outside runs. Despite it, I doubt Harvey is losing his grip on his share of the rushing workload. In Las Vegas' past two games against the Chargers and Browns, it has given up eight rushes of eight-plus yards (three went 20-plus yards) and four total touchdowns (three rushing) to RBs. Even if the Raiders give the Broncos a fight this week, there should be ample opportunities for Harvey to accumulate numbers, just maybe not with a lot of efficiency.  \nMUST STARTS: Brock Bowers STARTS: R.J.

That's always been the name of the game with him: If a defense can't pressure him, they won't be able to stop him. This will be Chicago's biggest problem because, on the season, they're second-worst in pass rush pressure rate (29.5%) and they're eighth-lowest in sacks, including just two sacks in their past three games. Their lack of pass rush should open the door for Love to throw freely and deeply, creating opportunities for his receivers against a defense that does play a lot of man-to-man coverage in the second half of close games. I don't think we've seen the last of the Packers receivers having good numbers; Watson has a huge 33.3% target per route run rate against man-to-man coverage in the Packers' past four games (since Tucker Kraft got hurt). He's my favorite receiver of the four, but Romeo Doubs and Dontayvion Wicks should also see some looks.  The Bears' run game has become a staple of their winning recipe, but this is a tough matchup. In their past five games, excluding garbage time, the Packers have allowed 3.9 yards per carry and a 7.9% explosive rush rate. That's good, not dominant, but it's impressive that that's what they've let up considering they've seen 28-plus RB rush attempts in four of those five games. That's a lot of running. The Bears will stick with their ground game as long as possible to control the clock and take pressure off of Caleb Williams, but if their defense can't do what it did last week, that plan will go out the window and Williams will have to play Superman against a Packers defense that brings a lot of pass rush pressure every week without having to blitz. That's problematic for Williams, who is among the league's least efficient passers when pressured, complete with a 37.2% completion rate, 4.6 yards per attempt, and a poor 1.8% TD rate.

Houston did well against Mahomes through the air in two games last season, holding him to no more than 260 yards and only one passing touchdown in each meeting; a rushing TD saved his stat line last December. Lately, the Texans have had a mean streak up front, blitzing more recently in competitive games. That's been affecting quarterbacks; only three quarterbacks have more than 21 Fantasy points against them all year, and none have more than 23.9. Mahomes hasn't been great versus pressure in years, but the make-up of his offense should help him since those pesky Texans outside corners might not venture inside the numbers to deal with Rashee Rice of Travis Kelce, and that's who he's leaned on since Rice's return from suspension. Mahomes is also a candidate to scramble when pressured, just as he did in his games against the Texans last year. All of the Chiefs studs are Fantasy worthy, but this isn't a great matchup for Kareem Hunt (the Texans just did a nice job against Jonathan Taylor last week) or Xavier Worthy (he'll see those cornerbacks a lot and hasn't delivered a good stat line in nearly two months).   MUST-STARTS: Patrick Mahomes, Rashee Rice, Nico Collins, Travis Kelce STARTS: Dalton Schultz, Texans DST (borderline DST) FLEX: Jayden Higgins, Kareem Hunt SITS: C.J.

Was the Chargers offensive line better coming out of the bye? Sort of -- they weren't great blocking up runs (even the long Vidal touchdown had some mistakes) and they wore down against the pass rush as the game went on. Going from the Raiders front to the Eagles front is a big step-up in class, especially if the Eagles get their act together versus the run after an embarrassing effort last week versus the Bears. We've seen bad play from the Chargers O-line before and it's led to weak stats from most everyone involved. As up-and-down as Philly has been defensively, they deserve the benefit of the doubt in this matchup. It could mean more weak numbers from many Chargers players.  MUST-STARTS: Patrick Mahomes, Rashee Rice, Nico Collins, Travis Kelce STARTS: Dalton Schultz, Texans DST (borderline DST) FLEX: Jayden Higgins, Kareem Hunt SITS: C.J.

You're still starting him in most formats, but he's struggling heading into Week 14 at the Chargers.Barkley has scored 13.1 PPR points or less in four games in a row against Green Bay, Detroit, Dallas and Chicago, and he only had 5.6 PPR points in Week 13 against the Bears. He failed to catch a pass against Chicago on two targets, and he hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 8.I'm hopeful Barkley will bounce back against the Chargers, but this isn't an easy matchup. Only five running backs this season have scored at least 15.3 PPR points, and that's the level of production we should expect from Barkley.But this version of Barkley has let us down lately, and I hope to see him back in the end zone in Week 14 or involved in the passing game. Or both, which would be ideal.\nUnfortunately, we just have to readjust our expectations for Barkley, and he should not be considered a top-10 Fantasy running back in Week 14. He's still good, but he might not be great against the Chargers.\nRBs to Start\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n

ideal. He had 13 carries for 35 yards and three catches for 27 yards on four targets, but thankfully he scored two touchdowns, including one in overtime. Harvey once again dominated playing time for the second game in a row without J.K. Dobbins (foot), and that should continue in Week 14 against the Raiders. And Las Vegas has allowed four running backs in the past two games against Cleveland and the Chargers to score at least 11.4 PPR points, with five touchdowns. I like Harvey as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CLE\n                    \n                         \n                        Cleveland\n                    \n                                            • #10\n                                            \n                                            Age: 22\n                                                                        • Experience: Rookie\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        TEN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    CLE -3.5\n                                    O/U 33.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                20th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                14.5\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                17th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    758\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    17\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    88\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.3\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Dylan Sampson (calf) missed practice Wednesday, and his absence could help Judkins' Fantasy outlook in Week 14 against the Titans. In Week 13 against San Francisco when Sampson was injured, Judkins had three catches for 18 yards on three targets, and it was his most receptions since Week 8 and most receiving yards since Week 5. He also added 23 carries for 91 yards, and Judkins has now scored at least 15.9 PPR points in each of his past two games against the Raiders and 49ers. Tennessee has allowed eight running backs this season to score at least 13.1 PPR points, and I like Judkins as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in the majority of leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        CHI\n                    \n                         \n                        Chicago\n                    \n                                            • #4\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 6 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        GB\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    GB -6.5\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                10th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10.4\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                19th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    774\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    25\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    237\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    14.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Swift had a dominant game in Week 13 at Philadelphia with 18 carries for 125 yards and a touchdown and one catch for 13 yards on two targets. He has now scored at least 14.8 PPR points in six of his past eight games, and he is worth using as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in the majority of leagues against the Packers, who will be without defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt (ankle) for the remainder of the year. Six running backs have scored at least 11.6 PPR points against Green Bay in the past five games, including a pair of teammates for the Giants in Week 11 (Tyrone Tracy Jr. and Devin Singletary) and the Lions in Week 13 (Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery), which bodes well for Swift and Kyle Monangai, who should be considered a sleeper. Monangai has scored a touchdown in four games in a row coming into Week 14.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SEA\n                    \n                         \n                        Seattle\n                    \n                                            • #9\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ATL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SEA -7\n                                    O/U 44.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                26th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                10.7\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                18th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    733\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    175\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    11.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Walker is playing well coming into Week 14 at Atlanta, and he has three games in a row with at least 10.4 PPR points, including two outings with at least 13.1 PPR points. His involvement in the passing game lately has been great with nine catches for 92 yards on 11 targets in his past three games, and he has at least three targets in each outing. The Falcons are No. 8 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and nine guys have scored at least 11.1 PPR points against Atlanta in the past seven games, including a pair of teammates for the Dolphins in Week 8 (De'Von Achane and Ollie Gordon II) and the Patriots in Week 9 (TreVeyon Henderson and Terrell Jennings), which bodes well for Walker and Zach Charbonnet, who should be considered a sleeper. Charbonnet has scored a touchdown in three of his past four games coming into Week 14.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        PIT\n                    \n                         \n                        Pittsburgh\n                    \n                                            • #30\n                                            \n                                            Age: 27\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        BAL\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    BAL -6\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                19th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                12.1\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                21st\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    639\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    27\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    228\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    5\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    13.1\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Warren didn't have a great game in Week 13 against Buffalo with 10 carries for 35 yards and two catches for 9 yards on four targets, but he scored a touchdown and finished with 12.4 PPR points. He's now scored a touchdown in two games in a row, and he has at least 11.1 PPR points in five of his past seven games coming into Week 14. The Ravens have allowed a running back to score at least 15.1 PPR points in six of their past seven games, and I like Warren as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in the majority of leagues in this

back in the majority of leagues. In four starts for Jones earlier this season, Mason averaged 14.5 PPR points, and he scored four touchdowns over that span. The Commanders are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and nine guys this season have scored at least 13 PPR points against Washington, including three in a row. I might use Mason as a flex even if Jones is active since he'll be playing at less than 100 percent.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n

have an easy matchup in Week 14 against the Rams, who are No. 4 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, but I still like Knight as a flex option in all leagues if Trey Benson (knee) and Emari Demercado (ankle) remain out. Knight has scored at least 13.2 PPR points in three games in a row, and he has at least 9.4 PPR points in six of eight outings since Benson was injured.

I would use him as a flex option in Week 14 against the Buccaneers, who are No. 7 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. Five running backs have scored at least 11.4 PPR points against Tampa Bay in the past four games, and the Buccaneers have allowed 14 catches for 212 yards and three touchdowns on 15 targets to the backfields in Buffalo, the Rams and Arizona in the past three games. That bodes well for Neal, who has eight catches for 65 yards on 10 targets in his past two outings.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        WAS\n                    \n                         \n                        Washington\n                    \n                                            • #36\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 3 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        MIN\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    MIN -1.5\n                                    O/U 42.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS RB\n                                \n                                13th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                7.6\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    RB RNK\n                                \n                                28th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    320\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REC\n                                    \n                                    1\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        REYDS\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    5.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Rodriguez will likely need a touchdown to boost his Fantasy value since he has one catch for 6 yards on two targets for the season. But he's scored a touchdown in three of his past four games, and the Vikings have allowed at least one rushing touchdown to a running back in six games in a row. Rodriguez also has at least 11 carries in three of his past four games, and he's become the primary running back for the Commanders ahead of Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols. But we need Rodriguez to find the end zone to be a quality flex option, so hopefully he gets another chance to score for Washington in this game.\n            \n            \n\nRBs to Sit\n

Marks as a flex option in Week 14 at Kansas City, but I can't continue to trust him as a No. 2 Fantasy running back in the majority of leagues. Even though he's taken over the Houston backfield ahead of Nick Chubb, Marks has scored 7.9 PPR points or less in three games in a row despite getting at least 17 total touches in each outing. His work in the passing game has disappeared with three catches for 5 yards on three targets in the past three weeks, and it doesn't help that the Chiefs are No. 6 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        KC\n

Hunt still led the Kansas City backfield with 14 carries for 58 yards and one catch for 22 yards on two targets. That said, he failed to score a touchdown for the first time since Week 7, and he only managed 9.0 PPR points against the Cowboys. Hunt should be considered a touchdown-dependent Fantasy running back when Pacheco is healthy, and the Texans have only allowed two running backs to score on the ground since Week 7. The Chiefs also have offensive line injuries with left tackle Josh Simmons (wrist) out, and left guard Trey Smith (ankle) and right tackle Jawaan Taylor (triceps) banged up. Hunt should be considered a flex option at best in most leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAC\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

Even if Vidal remains the leader of this tandem for now -- he's played at least 52 percent of the snaps in every game that Hampton was out -- this isn't an ideal situation for him. Justin Herbert (hand) will either be limited or out after having surgery Monday, and the offensive line for the Chargers remains a mess. Additionally, Vidal has mostly been good in games where the Chargers have won by double digits, and the Eagles are favored in this matchup in Los Angeles. Vidal should be considered a low-end No. 2 running back if Hampton remains out, and he's a flex at best if Hampton returns.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n

solid Fantasy outing in Week 13 against Green Bay with 12.8 PPR points because he scored a touchdown for the first time since Week 9. He finished the game with eight carries for 32 yards and two catches for 16 yards on two targets, and hopefully he can build on that performance in Week 14 against Dallas. I would use him as a flex option at best since the Cowboys run defense has been tough since acquiring Quinnen Williams and Logan Wilson via trade. In the past three games against Ashton Jeanty, Saquon Barkley and Kareem Hunt, that trio has combined for 30 carries for 87 yards and no touchdowns. And Dallas is actually No. 1 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to running backs over that span. Jahmyr Gibbs remains a must-start Fantasy running back because of his role in the passing game, but Montgomery could struggle if he fails to find the end zone.\n            \n            \n\n

    "body": "\n        The conference title is on the line, and so too is a potential College Football Playoff berth as No. 20 Tulane hosts No. 24 North Texas in the American Conference Championship Game. Both squads are led by departing coaches (Tulane's Jon Sumrall and North Texas' Eric Morris) who will continue to lead their respective programs through the end of the season, and neither wants this to be the final game for their headman before he exits for his new job.Considering where the American stands in the context of other Group of Five leagues, the longstanding assumption is that the league winner will be the fifth-highest ranked conference champion in the nation. With that designation comes an automatic bid in the CFP, likely as the No. 12 seed. And depending on what happens in the ACC, the victor could be held in even higher regard. Neither the Green Wave nor the Mean Green have ever played in the CFP, so history is on the table regardless of the result.The conference championship game is an on-campus affair in the American. Both teams went 7-1 in league play, but Tulane will host the title bout by virtue of being the highest-ranked American team in the Week 14 CFP Top 25. The Green Wave is unbeaten at home and posted the first 6-0 record in Yulman Stadium history.Tulane vs. North Texas: Need to knowLame-duck coaches: Sumrall and Morris have had their hands full of late, balancing tasks at two different schools. Both were announced as incoming coaches at Power Four universities with Sumrall bound for Florida and Morris set to take over at Oklahoma State. But unlike some coaches on the 2025 carousel (looking at you, Lane Kiffin), their schools permitted them to remain with their respective teams through the end of the season. It is a unique wrinkle in this matchup that brings into question how focused the coaches will be on the task at hand and how motivated their players will be to suit up for coaches who are on their way out.Class of the American: Although it came away victorious just once (2022), Tulane reached the conference championship game each of the last three years and on Friday will become the first program in American history to play in four consecutive title games. The Green Wave is also 29-3 in regular-season conference games dating back to 2022, good for the best winning percentage (.906) of any team in the FBS. It is a stretch of dominance for the Green Wave that spans multiple coaching staffs, which indicates an immense amount of program strength and suggests it will be able to reload once Sumrall departs for Florida.\nMean Green offensive machine: If North Texas defeats the perennial conference title contender and wins its first American crown, it will almost certainly be because of its offense. Redshirt freshman quarterback Drew Mestemaker leads the nation in passing with 3,835 yards, true freshman running back Caleb Hawkins paces the sport in rushing touchdowns (23) and total touchdowns (26), sophomore wide receiver Wyatt Young ranks third nationally with 1,203 receiving yards and the team as a whole is the highest-scoring operation in the country at 46.8 points per game. The Mean Green put up at least 52 points in each of their final three regular-season games.Where to watch Tulane vs. North Texas liveDate: Friday, Dec. 5 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Yulman Stadium -- New Orleans, LouisianaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Tulane vs. North Texas prediction, picks\nTulane is the more proven team against high-end competition. The Green Wave defeated a pair of Power Four opponents in Northwestern and Duke and did not lose to a team below .500. Meanwhile, let it not be forgotten that the last time (and only time) North Texas played a ranked team, it lost by 27 points to a conference foe in South Florida. While Mestemaker and his supporting cast could post a number that Tulane simply cannot match, the Green Wave is more battle-tested, familiar with the big stage and boasts home-field advantage. This might be a \"wrong team favored\" situation with Morris' unit laying a field goal on the road.

You can make Patriots vs. Seahawks picks well before the kickoff on Sunday, Feb. 8, and it's fitting these are the only two teams left to make NFL bets on. That's because they boast the two best spread records this year, with Seattle at 14-5 and New England at 13-6-1. However, that also means they aren't making it easy to make 2026 Super Bowl predictions which such a small ATS margin between them.Seattle is favored by 4.5 points (O/U 45.5) per the latest Super Bowl odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, with that NFL spread tied for the largest in the Super Bowl over the last 15 years. Favorites of 4.5 points or more in the Super Bowl are 5-6, straight-up, since 2000. Underdogs have covered 52.6% of the time in Super Bowl history, which is close to the flip of a coin, so that Super Bowl spread trend may not help much with your Seahawks vs. Patriots bets. Thus, seeking out some NFL betting advice is essential.

Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top Super Bowl expert picks from Micah RobertsRoberts, a former Vegas bookmaker, is 11-4 (+658) over his last 15 Patriots ATS picks. For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under on rushing yard, which he locked in at 77.5 (-125).\"New England's run defense is stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop at its current line (70.5) at DraftKings here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (45.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too. Our model has 44 points.\" See the rest of Severance's picks here, and bet the total here:\nHow to make 2026 Super Bowl picksSportsLine's team of experts also includes Brady Kannon, a former SuperContest winner who enters Super Bowl LX on a sizzling 29-15 run (66%) on NFL picks, returning over $1,200 for $100 players. You can find out who his NFL picks are for the Super Bowl 2026 here. If you are looking for NFL picks, NFL props, or NFL best bets for Super Bowl 60, SportsLine has you covered with its proven team of experts.

    "body": "\nWhether you've made Super Bowl DFS picks before, or this will be your first time playing NFL daily Fantasy for The Big Game, you're aware that someone will come out of nowhere to make a major impact. Thus, NFL DFS lineups should comprise more than just big names like Sam Darnold, Drake Maye, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Hunter Henry. The Championship Round saw Jake Bobo find the end zone for Seattle and Mack Hollins lead New England in receiving, so those could be the type of underrated options for your daily Fantasy football strategy and Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineups. Then, there are, of course, the kickers who always have big impacts in The Big Game.Who should you target from the Super Bowl DFS player pool, and who are the sleepers your NFL DFS strategy should consider to help differentiate your lineups when kickoff comes at 6:30 p.m. ET? Before making any NFL DFS picks or locking in Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel for Super Bowl LX, be sure to check out SportsLine's advanced NFL DFS lineup optimizer.\nThe DFS Optimizer uses info from the SportsLine Advanced-Data Projection Model and DFS Professional Millionaire Mike McClure to identify top DFS picks/plays for any slate on betting apps like DraftKings and FanDuel. It simulates every game 10,000 times to help DFS players optimize and build winning DraftKings and FanDuel lineups. Optimize, export, and enter lineups confidently with injury updates, floor and ceiling player projections, and Vegas lines and picks all with one winning tool.Now, SportsLine's NFL DFS Optimizer has turned its attention to Super Bowl LX and just locked in its top daily Fantasy football lineups. You can only see its optimal lineups at SportsLine.Top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of the optimizer's top Super Bowl DFS value picks is Seahawks receiver Rashid Shaheed. After a slow start to his Seattle tenure, Shaheed has come on strong as of late. Over his last seven games, he has at least 50 scrimmage yards or a touchdown in five contests. Also, New England is vulnerable to wide receivers finding the endzone against it as just five teams allowed more wideout touchdowns in the regular season than the Patriots. The Pats also gave up a punt return touchdown in 2025, adding to the DFS value Shaheed, who has three return scores this regular plus postseason. See who else to pick here.You can also bet Shaheed to go Over 22.5 total receiving yards at DraftKings:\nThe optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes building around Patriots quarterback Maye. While Seattle has the No. 6 total defense, Maye is the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat three top-5 total defenses in a single postseason. So, he won't be intimidated by Seattle's unit, and it was one which was just shredded by Matthew Stafford. In the NFC Title Game, the Seahawks allowed its most passing touchdowns (3) of the year, it's second-highest passer rating (126.5) and its third-most passing yards (370). Add in that Maye has 65-plus rushing yards in two of three postseason games, and Maye, who was the NFL MVP runner-up to Stafford, is poised to produce, Fantasy-wise, on Super Bowl Sunday. You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here.Bet Maye to go Over 264.5 passing plus rushing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to build Patriots vs. Seahawks DFS lineupsThe NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers in the 2026 Super Bowl. Those players could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who they are, and the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine. So what is the optimal NFL DFS lineup for Super Bowl Sunday, and which under-the-radar Seahawks vs. Patriots DFS picks offer huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, rankings, advice and stacks, all from an NFL DFS optimizer that simulates every game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final NFL DFS slate of the season arrives on Sunday at Levi's Stadium when the 2026 Super Bowl unfolds between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots (+4.5, 45.5 at DraftKings) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Some of the year's biggest daily Fantasy producers will be on display as Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was second among receivers in Fantasy points, while New England quarterback Drake Maye was third among quarterbacks. Meanwhile, Pats tight end Hunter Henry ranked fourth at his position in Fantasy points in the regular season.They'll be popular NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60, but who are the daily Fantasy sleeper picks who can create salary cap space to build a winning roster? Every Big Game sees a player come out of nowhere to make both real-life and Fantasy impacts. So, before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the 2026 Super Bowl, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.\nNow, McClure has turned his attention to the 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60 is Smith-Njigba, who is looking to cap a monster season where he led the NFL in receiving yardage at 1,793. After a relatively quiet week in the divisional round, he got back to his dominant ways against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, posting a 10-153-1 receiving line. By Super Bowl standards, the Patriots did not have an elite Fantasy defense against receivers this season, ranking 10th in Fantasy points allowed to that position group. They've also given up a touchdown to an opposing receiver in three of the past four games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Smith-Njigba to go Over 94.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp. The 32-year-old has become a secondary option this season, but he has seen his target share increase a bit in the NFL playoffs. That helped lead to a touchdown against the Rams in the NFC title game, and just five teams allowed more touchdowns to wideouts than the Pats in the regular season. With elite New England cornerback Christian Gonzalez likely shadowing Smith-Njigba for much of the game, there's a great chance that Kupp will get more opportunities on Sunday, all at a very affordable NFL DFS price. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Kupp to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in Patriots vs. Seahawks. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for the Super Bowl, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Super Bowl 60 wasn't the most thrilling game in NFL history, but at least the commercial breaks provided some entertainment as the Seattle Seahawks hammered the New England Patriots, 29-13. Like every Super Bowl, this one had its share of commercial duds, but we're here to talk about the standouts.On the whole, Super Bowl 60 commercials got off to a slow start. The ads during the first quarter elicited more groans and eye rolls than laughs. Fortunately for all of us, the quality picked up in the second quarter, and we got some memorable ones the rest of the way.This year's batch of commercials got the job done in a number of ways. Some leaned on star power and nostalgia, which didn't always work, while others yanked on heart strings to leave an impression.Bosch was a good example of the former category, employing Guy Fieri as you've never seen him before. On the other end of the spectrum, Redfin and Rocket Mortgage simply showed people coming together as a community during trying times. Both commercials cracked the top 10 with room to spare, but they arrived here via different paths.\nWith another round of (very pricy) commercials down, here are the top 10 from Super Bowl 60.10. Dunkin | Good Will Dunkin\nThe de-aging in this one was right out of the uncanny valley, and it very much relied on \"remember this?!\" for comedy. All that said, it was all worth it if the whole thing was a ploy to get Jennifer Aniston to say, \"How about these nuts?\" on national television.9. Bud Light | Keg\nLast year's Bud Light ad featuring the trio of Shane Gillis, Post Malone and Peyton Manning was a bit strong, but this wasn't bad by any means. The trail gag was good, and frankly, the anticipation cracking open the first cold beverage of the wedding reception is practically universal.\n8. T-Mobile | Tell Me Why\nThe Backstreet Boys are back for this Super Bowl 60 commercial. This one was just good fun seeing the reactions of all the customers in the store. The best part might have been Machine Gun Kelly performing for no one at the end.7. Bosch | The More You Bosch\nAs unsettling as it was to see Guy Fieri dressed and styled like a regular joe, it was a good bit, and this commercial was a big step up from the confused ad Bosch ran during Super Bowl 59 featuring a Randy Savage impersonator. The French Bulldog taking on Fieri's signature look was a nice touch.6. Hellmann's | Meal Diamond\nThis commercial felt like a skit that Andy Samberg and John Mulaney would have written during their \"Saturday Night Live\" days. A Neil Diamond impersonator cursed to remain in a deli, and he can only sing about mayo until the curse is broken. It's an off-the-wall premise that Samberg sells very well.\n5. Liquid I.V. | Take A Look\nThis commercial felt like a throwback to a different age of Super Bowl ads in the best way possible. The laughs didn't come from celebrity antics or nostalgia. It was a unique and creative premise that had you wondering where it was going until the very end.4. Budweiser | American Icons\nAn eagle riding a Clydesdale. \"Free Bird\" blaring as the majestic bird takes flight. There are some things that we can all admit are awesome, and two of them were in this commercial.3. Pepsi | The Choice\nA little bit of hatred and rivalry is good on the field. It's also fun to see off the field, which is why this spot from Pepsi ranks among the best of the night. Taking a swing at Coca-Cola and ending it with a reference to the viral Coldplay concert? Well done.\n2. Redfin | America Needs Neighbors Like You\nHeartfelt commercials take the top two spots. That strikes me as unusual, but they were simply a rung above the others. This spot from Redfin and Rocket Mortgage made community the primary focus, and I think that struck a chord with the audience.1. Lay's | Last Harvest\nI wasn't expecting the potato chip company to make the biggest impact of them all, but here we are. The father-daughter relationship worked in this one, and it tugged on the heart strings without overdoing the cheesy factor. This commercial was good enough to warrant consideration in our top 25 of all time.\n            ",

The award went to Seattle Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III following his performance in a 29-13 win against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX.Walker is the first running back to win the award since former Denver Broncos running back Terrell Davis rushed for 157 yards and three touchdowns in Super Bowl XXXII. Davis' performance led the Broncos to a 31-24 upset win over the defending champion Green Bay Packers that snapped the NFC's 13-year winning streak in the big game. He earned MVP honors despite missing nearly the entire second quarter with a migraine.The 25-year-old Walker has joined an exclusive fraternity of running backs that includes six Pro Football Hall of Famers.Running backs who have won Super Bowl MVP ** -- Members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Super BowlPlayerStatsLX (2026)Kenneth Walker, Seahawks27 carries, 135 yards XXXII (1998)**Terrell Davis, Broncos30 carries, 157 yards, 3 TDsXXVIII (1994)**Emmitt Smith, Cowboys30 carries, 132 yards, 2 TDsXXV (1991)Ottis Anderson, Giants21 carries, 102 yards, TDXVIII (1984)**Marcus Allen, Raiders21 carries, 191 yards, 2 TDsXVII (1983)**John Riggins, Washington38 carries, 166 yards, TDIX (1975)**Franco Harris, Steelers34 carries, 158 yards, TDVIII (1974)**Larry Csonka, Dolphins33 carries, 145 yards, 2 TDsThat list does not include former Washington running back Timmy Smith, whose 204 rushing yards in Super Bowl XXII remain the single-game record. It also does not include former Buffalo Bills running back Thurman Thomas, who likely would have won MVP of Super Bowl XXV if Scott Norwood had converted his 47-yard field goal attempt in the game's final seconds. Thomas rushed for 135 yards and a touchdown and totaled 190 all-purpose yards in Buffalo's 20-19 loss to the Giants.\nThe award instead went to the 34-year-old Anderson, a former All-Pro who became the oldest player to win Super Bowl MVP. He remains the oldest non-quarterback to earn the honor.Like the other seven running backs to win Super Bowl MVP, Walker's performance helped lead his team to victory. Walker's 94 rushing yards in the first half was the second-most in Super Bowl history behind only Smith's 131. His runs of 29 and 30 yards on Seattle's fourth drive helped set up Jason Myers' second field goal of the night while extending the Seahawks' lead to 6-0. Walker became the first player in the Super Bowl to record two runs of at least 20 yards on one drive.  \nWhile he was less productive in the second half, his 20-yard catch-and-run on the Seahawks' first drive of the second half set up Myers' fourth field goal. Walker and Myers were complemented by a Seattle defense that dominated the Patriots' offense all night. The Seahawks kept the Patriots off the scoreboard through three quarters and essentially put the game away when Uchenna Nwosu recorded a 45-yard pick-six with 4:27 left. \nThe Seahawks have now won two Super Bowls and evened their overall record in the big game at 2-2. Seattle's win on Sunday night also avenged its last-minute loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl XLIX.\n            \n    ",

What about inviting him to your wedding only for him to turn around and invite you to tie the knot during his Super Bowl 60 halftime performance? That scenario became reality for one lucky couple on Sunday night.Right before Lady Gaga made her surprise guest appearance at Levi's Stadium, an officiant wed two people. That left everyone wondering whether it was real or part of the show. Well, the answer is both.According to NBC Sports, that was a real wedding, and it came about after the couple invited Bad Bunny to their nuptials. Bad Bunny couldn't make it because he was busy performing at the Super Bowl halftime show, but simply brought the wedding to Levi's Stadium.\nIncluding the wedding, Bad Bunny's halftime show was quite the event. In addition to guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, countless celebs could be spotted within the production. Jessica Alba, Pedro Pascal, Karol G and Cardi B were among the A-listers on the set. It was a historic performance, and fans were raving about it when the festivities were over.\nThe performance provided some much-needed energy in the building as the game on the field lacked for fireworks in the first half. The Seattle Seahawks took a 9-0 lead over the New England Patriots into the locker room before Bad Bunny took center stage.\n            \n    ",

Philadelphia ended up winning that game 40-22. \nWith a halftime score of 9-0, that's one of the lowest scoring totals in a first half in Super Bowl history, but it's not the lowest ever. That record belongs to Super Bowl IX, a game where the Steelers led the Vikings 2-0 at the half before winning 16-6. The Patriots were involved in the second-lowest scoring first half in Super Bowl LIII when they led the Rams just 3-0 at the half of a game that they would win 13-3. This is the fifth lowest-scoring first half in Super Bowl history. This year's game was just the fifth Super Bowl in NFL history to feature zero touchdowns in the first half. Seahawks kicker Jason Myers scored accounted for all nine points with three field goals. \nThe reason the Patriots haven't been able to score is because they can't get anything going on offense. Drake Maye has been facing pressure on almost every play and that's led to three sacks for the Seahawks. Maye has thrown for just 48 yards in the first half and if you toss in the fact that Maye lost 30 yards on his three sacks, that means the team's passing total is at just 18 yards. The Patriots did drive into Seattle territory on each of their first two drives, but they ended up totaling -21 yards on the five plays they ran in Seahawks territory on those two drives. The Patriots totaled just 51 yards in the first half, but that wasn't the lowest total ever because it more than doubled what the Chiefs did last year against the Eagles (23 yards). What the offense struggling, the Patriots will now have to deft history if they want to win their seventh Lombardi Trophy. The could also make history if they don't score because no team has ever been shutout in the Super Bowl. \nIf you want to keep tabs on what happens during the second half of Super Bowl LX, be sure to follow along in our live blog here. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Jason Myers didn't win Super Bowl MVP on Sunday night, but he was definitely one of Seattle's most valuable players during their dominant 29-13 win over the Patriots. The Seahawks kicker set a Super Bowl record for most field goals by drilling five kicks. In the history of the Super Bowl, there had been four kickers who had hit four field goals, but no one had ever hit five. The record-setting kick came with just under five minutes left to play when he drilled a 26-yard field goal to put Seattle up, 22-7. \nThat kick followed four earlier conversions which came from 33, 39, 41 and 41. Not only did Myers set the Super Bowl record for most field goals, but he also etched his name into the NFL record book. With 17 points against the Patriots, Myers now has 206 for the season, which is the most that any player has ever scored in any NFL season ever. As a matter of fact, he's the only player ever to top 200 points in a single season. The regular-season record for most points is held by Chargers running back LaDainian Tomlinson, who scored 186 points during his MVP season in 2006. Tomlinson tacked on two touchdowns during the postseason that year to give him a total of 198, and until Myers came along, that was the record most points ever scored by a player in the regular season and postseason combined in a single year. \nMyers was able to top Tomlinson's record because the Seahawks used him often during the regular season. He hit a total of 41 field goals while scoring 171 points in 2025, which led the league. To catch Tomlinson's all-time scoring total, though, Myers need to have a huge postseason and that's exactly what has happened. He scored 11 points, including two field goals, in Seattle's 41-6 win over the 49ers during the divisional round. He then followed that up with seven points in the Seahawks' 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC title game. Going into the Super Bowl, Myers was at 189 points, so breaking Tomlinson's record wasn't a given. Myers didn't even have to wait long to tie the record, because he hit three field goals in the first half against the Patriots, which tied the Super Bowl record for most field goals in the first half of a game. In the third quarter, Myers hit a 41-yarder that tied the Super Bowl record for most field goals and made him the first player in NFL history to hit 200 points. \nYou could certainly argue that Myers should have been Super Bowl MVP, but in the end, the award went to Kennth Walker. Myers would have been the first kicker ever to win the award, but he doesn't have much to complain about after a record-setting night where he was one of the best players on the field. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        U.S. men's national team midfielder Weston McKennie scored yet again for Juventus on Sunday, continuing a well-timed career-best goalscoring run ahead of this summer's World Cup in North America.McKennie nabbed Juventus' first goal in a 2-2 draw against Lazio, the goal kicking off his side's comeback with a 59th-minute header that slashed the visitors' lead in half. The play started as Kenan Yildiz made his way into the penalty area but looked to play a pass, spotting Manuel Locatelli making a central run into the box. Before he entered the area, though, Locatelli spotted McKennie in front of him and the American acted quickly to take a shot, but the ball hit an opponent instead.The ball then drifted to McKennie's right and fell to Juventus substitute Edon Zhegrova, who took a shot that was met with a save by Lazio goalkeeper Ivan Provedel. The ball then rolled to the attackers' left, McKennie making a run towards the ball but smartly stopping as it whizzed out of reach. Andrea Cambiaso met up with the ball at the endline instead, McKennie aware of his teammate's movement and taking a few backwards steps before turning towards goal, leaping in the air and flicking the ball into the back of the net with his head, adding style points by kissing it off the post.Watch the goal below.\nMcKennie now has seven goals across all competitions for Juventus this season, officially making it his best goalscoring season in his club career. He scored all of his goals after ex-Italy boss Luciano Spalletti took over as the team's coach in November, Spalletti's tactical preferences paving the way for a new role that has allowed McKennie to flex his attacking skills. He has been a fixture for the new coach as an attack-minded player on the right, though he has the freedom to move centrally and play a large role in Juventus' goalscoring operation, a stylistic change the 27-year-old has seamlessly transitioned to.\nAttacking assignments are not unfamiliar to the versatile McKennie but since joining Juventus at the start of the 2020-21 season, he has been deployed in a wide variety of positions including as a deep-lying midfielder and as a wingback, roles that did not maximize his attacking strengths. Spalletti had a very different impression of McKennie's skillset, one that has benefitted the team and the player in equal measure.\"McKennie is a perfect central striker,\" Spalletti said following last month's statement win over Serie A champions Napoli. \"He fights, he's strong in the air and he can jump high. He plays to get results because he makes decisions. He would be a perfect striker.\"McKennie's current form offers USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino another option to find goals as he attempts to build an attack-minded version of the team in time for next summer's World Cup on home soil. How exactly Pochettino might deploy McKennie is currently a bit of an unknown – the player has been in and out of the national team over the last year, chiefly due to a lack of availability. He was ineligible for last June's Concacaf Gold Cup while competing at the Club World Cup with Juventus and Pochettino left him off the roster for the November friendlies, a 2-1 win against future World Cup group stage opponent Paraguay and a 5-1 win over Uruguay, so he could settle in after Spalletti's hire.\nJuventus currently sit in fourth place, 12 points adrift of Serie A leaders, but in the midst of a competitive battle to qualify for next season's edition of the UEFA Champions League.\n            ",

For the big game, Hollins showed up wearing handcuffs and leg shackles. \nNormally, I'd say that's an homage to Hannibal Lecter, but this is Hollins we're talking about, so it could just be something he had in his closet. That being said, there is a slight risk when it comes to wearing shackles to the stadium, because if you lose the keys to open them, then you're kind of screwed. The good news for Hollins is that he definitely didn't lose the keys and we know that because he made it out on the field for warmups. The quirky Hollins didn't wear his jersey during pregame warmups though, instead, he wore a throwback jersey. \nThat's right, he wore Mike Vrabel's high school jersey. The Patriots coach graduated from Walsh Jesuit in Ohio back in 1992, so that's quite the throwback. Hollins, who's in his first year with the Patriots, hasn't put up big numbers this year, but he has made several key plays. As a matter of fact, he's had at least one catch of 20 yards or more in seven different games, including the AFC Championship, when he caught a huge 31-yarder in New England's 10-7 win over Denver. So don't be surprised if he makes a big player or two against the Seahawks in the Super Bowl. \nOur team over at SportsLine came up with a list of best bets for the Super Bowl and a prop from Hollins actually made the list. You can check that out here. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Seahawks completed their transformation from being a recent NFL afterthought to becoming the 2025 NFL season's Super Bowl champions after a dominating 29-13 Super Bowl LX victory over the AFC champion New England Patriots. The 2025 Seahawks had the longest preseason championship odds (60-1) by a Super Bowl champion since the 2001 Patriots, New England's first Super Bowl title team that also had 60-1 odds. They're also the first team to win the Super Bowl a season after missing the playoffs entirely since the 2020 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a franchise that was transformed by the free agency arrival of Tom Brady. Seattle won it all with immaculate play on both sides of the ball: the Seahawks became the first Super Bowl champion ever without a turnover in the postseason, and Seattle's defense became the first to allow no points through three quarters of a Super Bowl since the 1974 \"Steel Curtain\" Pittsburgh Steelers defense. With Super Bowl LX now in the history books and blue and green confetti raining down at Levi's Stadium, let's take a look at some of the key narratives from the Seahawks' dominating victory and figure out if they are overreactions or reality. \nSam Darnold silenced his doubters with turnover-free postseasonOverreaction vs. reality: Reality  When people discussed the Seahawks throughout the 2025 season, it always felt like there was a \"yeah but\" around them because of quarterback Sam Darnold. That was fair given Seattle is his fifth NFL team, and he did lead the 2025 regular season in turnovers with 20, 14 off of interceptions and six off of lost fumbles. However, he silenced all his doubters by playing turnover free football in his three 2025 postseason games. That put him in elite playoff company, joining Drew Brees, Steve Young and Troy Aikman as the only four quarterbacks to win the Super Bowl and have no postseason turnovers in a postseason across the last 35 postseasons. He's also now the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl as a starter after playing for at least five teams.   Darnold's final 2025 playoffs stat line ended up as follows: 61.5% completion percentage (second-best this postseason), 672 pass yards (third-most this postseason), 7.5 yards per pass attempt (third-most this postseason), five passing touchdowns (third-most this postseason), no interceptions and a 102.4 passer rating (second-most this postseason). People can now say the following sentence without a hint of sarcasm, \"You can win a Super Bowl with Sam Darnold as your quarterback.\" \nCornerback Devon Witherspoon is a legitimate starOverreaction vs. reality: RealitySeahawks cornerback Devon Witherspoon is just the third defensive back in the past 40 years with a Pro Bowl selection in each of his first three seasons joining Hall of Famer Charles Woodson and 2010s All-Decade Team member Patrick Peterson. He backed up his early career accolades in Super Bowl LX by racking up a sack and two quarterback pressures, including THE key quarterback pressure in the Super Bowl. Edge rusher Uchenna Nwosu's pick six was forced by Witherspoon's pressure, and he took it all the way back for a 45-yard touchdown that put the game out of reach, 29-7, with 4:27 left to play. That gave him a case to be the game's MVP. Witherspoon will continue ascending in head coach Mike Macdonald's defense for years to come. \nJason Myers had the best kicking season ever capped off with Super Bowl history Overreaction vs. reality: Reality  If Seattle Seahawks kicker Jason Myers' five made field goals felt like a lot, it's because they were. His Super Bowl LX performance broke the Super Bowl's all-time, single-game made field goals record as his leg was responsible for all the scoring through the first three quarters of action on Sunday. Myers made the record-breaking kick from 26 yards out to put the Seahawks up 22-7 with 5:35 left to play. He's also become the first player in NFL history to score 200-plus points in a season, including the playoffs.\nMost field goals made in a game, Super Bowl historyMade Field GoalsSEA Jason Myers (2025)5PHI Jake Elliott (2024)4KC Harrison Butker (2023)4SF Ray Wersching (1981) 4GB Don Chandler (1967)4Edge rusher Derick Hall is a rising starOverreaction vs. reality: Overreaction  Seattle Seahawks edge rusher Derick Hall, a 2023 second-round pick out of Auburn, registered one of the best defensive performances in Super Bowl history. He became the 10th player with multiple sacks and a forced fumble in a Super Bowl since sacks became an officially tracked sack in 1982, per CBS Sports Research. His strip-sack helped set up the Seahawks' first touchdown of the game, a 16-yard play-action pass from Darnold to tight end AJ Barner. Milton Williams, a current New England Patriot, achieved the feat with the Philadelphia Eagles in their 40-22 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX last season. However, this performance is an outlier for Hall, who had just two sacks in the entire 2025 season after playing in 14 games and only starting three of them. However, this performance likely gives the Seahawks enough confidence to let edge rusher Boye Mafe walk in free agency and empower him to start down the road with DeMarcus Lawrence (33 years old) getting up there, relatively speaking for NFL edge rushers. \nWill Campbell needs to move inside to guard if he's to have a long NFL careerOverreaction vs. reality: Reality  New England Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, the fourth overall pick of the 2025 NFL Draft, experienced a rude awakening this postseason. His four sacks allowed, including one in Super Bowl LX, and his 12 quarterback pressures allowed were both the most this postseason. That's on top of six sacks allowed in the regular season in 13 games played, that's nearly a sack every other game. Some were worried about Campbell and his wingspan when he came out of the draft this spring, and he's proved those doubters right. Campbell, who is listed at 6-6, 319 pounds, was measured as having 32 5/8\" arms at the NFL Scouting Combine. Offensive tackles with longer arms have a better opportunity to prevent edge rushers from plowing into their chest because of better reachPatriots 2010s All-Decade Team left guard Logan Mankins' arm length was 33 3/8\" -- longer than Campbell's. Just like Campbell at LSU, Mankins was a left tackle at Fresno State. However, he moved inside to guard in the NFL. Campbell would be better served to protect Maye if doing so from the interior. Maye's 21 sacks this postseason are the most in a single postseason, and his seven fumbles are tied for the most in a single postseason. He was sacked at least five times in all four of New England's playoff games, which makes Maye tied for the third-most five-sack games in a career after just his first playoff run. Campbell's inability to protect his blindside played a major role in that statistic. \n            ",

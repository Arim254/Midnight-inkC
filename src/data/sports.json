There were plenty of surprises in this matchup, whether it was the 17 total points scored or how the weather went from beautiful to a nightmarish blizzard in the second half. It was actually a surprise that secured the game for the Patriots, as quarterback Drake Maye went rogue on a third-and-5 to move the chains and run out the clock late in the fourth quarter. According to The Boston Herald, Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels called an outside zone run for Rhamondre Stevenson on third down with 1:57 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Patriots held a three-point lead, and their defense was playing well -- holding Denver scoreless since the first quarter. Instead of handing the ball to Stevenson, Maye kept it and ran out to the left -- beating the Broncos defense for a first down. \"I hit my block, and all the defenders started running the other way,\" Patriots center Garrett Bradbury said. \"I'm like, 'What? Oh my God.'\"\nMaye told his teammates after the game that he debated telling them he was going to keep the ball. He decided against it. \n\"After the game, Drake's like, 'I debated telling you guys if I was gonna (keep) it or not. But I just decided not to,\" Bradbury said.Maye completed 10 of 21 passes for 86 yards on Sunday, becoming just the second quarterback since 1990 to win a conference championship game while throwing for under 100 yards, the other being Jimmy Garoppolo in 2019. However, Maye made an impact with his legs, rushing 10 times for 65 yards and the Patriots' lone touchdown of the game.\nThanks to Maye's gamble, the Patriots find themselves in the Super Bowl for the first time since 2019.\n            \n    ",

On Sunday, Feb. 8, the AFC champion New England Patriots will do battle with the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks for the right to raise the Lombardi Trophy.New England advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time since the 2018 season thanks to consecutive victories over the Los Angeles Chargers, Houston Texans and Denver Broncos. The Patriots won a sloppy, snowy AFC title game over a Broncos team starting its backup quarterback, emerging with a 10-7 win thanks to several Denver miscues, some well-timed runs from Drake Maye and an electric performance from a defense that has stepped up in a big way during this playoff run.Seattle is headed back to the Super Bowl for the first time since making it in back-to-back years in 2013 and 2014. The Seahawks earned a first-round bye and then defeated the division rival San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Rams in consecutive weeks. They won a thrilling, back-and-forth NFC title game on the strength of a fantastic performance from Sam Darnold, who slayed some demons by throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in the 31-27 victory.Which of these two teams will emerge victorious and hoist the Lombardi Trophy? We'll find out soon enough. But in the meantime, here's a look at how you can actually watch the game.Where to watch Super Bowl 2026Date: Sunday, Feb. 8 | Time: 6:30 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: NBC | Stream: fubo (try for free)Halftime performer: Bad BunnyFollow: CBS Sports App\nFind all of our Super Bowl LX coverage at CBSSports.com right here.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The matchup is set. It'll be the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots duking it out for the right to lift the Lombardi Trophy and call themselves Super Bowl LX champions. These clubs find themselves en route to Santa Clara for the big game after eking out wins on Championship Sunday, albeit in different fashions. Seattle had to throw its way to a Super Bowl appearance as Sam Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship. Meanwhile, New England churned out a 10-7 win during a snowy AFC Championship against the Denver Broncos at Mile High. The Patriots leaned on defense and Drake Maye's rushing ability to punch their ticket. While these are widely different versions of these clubs, this is a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX back during the 2014 season. That game is remembered most for Malcolm Butler's infamous goal-line interception to give Tom Brady and the Patriots their then-fourth Super Bowl title in franchise history, and spoil Russell Wilson and the Seahawks bid at back-to-back championships. That's the history. But what does the future have in store for us in this upcoming Super Bowl? What do the oddsmakers think of this matchup? Below, we'll comb over the initial lines for Super Bowl LX and also highlight some of the notable favorites for Super Bowl MVP. NFL odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.\nGameEarly LineEarly TotalEarly MoneylineSeahawks vs. PatriotsSeahawks -4.546.5Seahawks -230, Patriots +190While Lumen Field and Gillette Stadium are two of the better home-field advantages that the NFL has to offer, both Seattle and New England were superb on the road this season, which could help them on this neutral site at Levi's Stadium for Super Bowl LX. With their win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship, New England became the first team in NFL history to go 9-0 on the road. Mike Vrabel's team was also 7-2 ATS in those nine road matchups. As for Seattle, they did not go undefeated on the road like the Patriots, but were an equally impressive 8-1 on the road. They also come into this Super Bowl with an NFL-best 8-1 ATS road record. \nPlayerSuper Bowl MVP oddsSam Darnold+130Drake Maye+235Jaxon Smith-Njigba+550Kenneth Walker III+600Rhamondre Stevenson+2500Rashid Shaheed+2800Marcus Jones+5500Stefon Diggs+6000Naturally, both quarterbacks are going to be No. 1 and No. 2 in the odds to win Super Bowl MVP. With the Seahawks favored, it makes sense to see Darnold as the odds-on favorite for the award. Seven of the last 10 Super Bowl MVPs were quarterbacks. Two of the remaining three were wide receivers (Cooper Kupp in Super Bowl LVI and Julian Edelman in Super Bowl LIII), while Von Miller (Super Bowl 50) was the other non-QB MVP and lone defensive player to earn the distinction over the last decade. \nInterestingly, both Kenneth Walker III and Rhamondre Stevenson have favorable odds out of the gate. If either of them is named Super Bowl MVP, they'd become the first running back to earn the award since Terrell Davis after Super Bowl XXXII. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The bad weather in Denver appeared to have thrown off a key field goal attempt for the Broncos on Sunday, and it might have cost them the game.During New England's 10-7 win, Broncos kicker Wil Lutz missed two field goals, with the most critical coming in the fourth quarter. With just under five minutes left to play, the Broncos were facing a fourth-and-5 from New England's 28-yard line, so Sean Payton sent Lutz out for a 45-yard attempt.The kick missed after it was blocked by New England's Leonard Taylor. According to Lutz, Broncos holder Jeremy Crawshaw may have lined up a yard closer to the line of scrimmage than he should have.\"Unfortunately, you couldn't see the lines on the field and honestly, I think we were … we might have been a yard short on the snap,\" Lutz said via Denver Sports. \"Can't see the lines on the field and we had to kind of estimate, and a guy comes through, and it was blocked.\"With the snow making it difficult to see, Crawshaw essentially had to estimate his spot, and he ended up a yard off.\nAs you can see above, Taylor was only able to get his fingertips on the ball, so if Crawshaw had lined up another yard back, Lutz's kick likely would have had enough height to clear Taylor's hand. In the NFL, the holder is usually lined up about eight yards behind the line of scrimmage, but Crawshaw was only seven yards back.Lutz missed two field goals on what was a disastrous day for kickers. New England's Andy Borregales also missed two attempts. The four combined misses were the most in a conference title game since 1983, when San Francisco and Washington combined to miss six kicks in the NFC Championship.Besides the 45-yarder, Lutz also missed a 54-yard attempt in the first half before the weather turned. He was reliable for the Broncos this year, hitting 28 of 32 field goals, but he has a history of struggling in the playoffs. Over his career, Lutz has made just 68.2% of his postseason field goal attempts (15 of 22).\nIf the fourth-quarter kick hadn't been blocked, there's a good chance the game would have gone to overtime, because neither team moved the ball much in the second half. And if it had reached overtime, every field goal attempt would have been an adventure in those conditions. Instead, Lutz's kick was denied, and the Patriots are now headed to the Super Bowl for the 12th time in franchise history.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The Los Angeles Rams' season came to an end Sunday in a 31-27 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game, putting an unsatisfy",
    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Rams' season came to an end Sunday in a 31-27 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game, putting an unsatisfying end to what was otherwise an outstanding season. After hardly practicing ahead of the season amid back issues, Matthew Stafford played at an MVP level, leading the highest-scoring offense in the NFL. The defense, led by rising star coordinator Chris Shula had a deep, talented pass rush and forced 26 turnovers, fifth-most in the NFL.It wasn't quite enough. The Rams' linebackers and secondary, a combination of low-cost veteran acquisitions and in-house development projects, struggled in Seattle, a special teams blunder proved costly, and the offense came up just short in the red zone late.The Rams the Super Bowl in Stafford's first season in Los Angeles, the dream pairing between him and Sean McVay working wonders. After a down 2022, they've been in the playoffs each of the last three seasons, and they've been desperately close in all three season-ending losses. The Stafford-McVay combination remains outstanding, especially with Puka Nacua and Davante Adams on the outside and one of the league's top running games to boot.Still, McVay acknowledged that just because the Rams have gotten one step closer each of the last three seasons doesn't mean another Super Bowl trip is next. As with every offseason for every team, there are major questions, and the Rams have some of the biggest ones. Here's what's ahead for Los Angeles.\nWill Matthew Stafford return?Stafford turns 38 in two weeks. He might ring it in with an MVP trophy, and it would be well-deserved. He led the NFL in passing yards (4,707), passing touchdowns (46) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (46-8). It was the best season of his career from a statistical standpoint, and he showed he still has the absurd arm talent to make jaw-dropping throws all over the field. In the NFC Championship Game loss, he threw for 374 yards and three touchdowns, took just one sack and did not have a turnover against arguably the NFL's best defense, on the road.There's no doubt he can still play. The question is whether he will.Stafford has mulled his future before, including last year, when he returned to the Rams only after getting a revised contract. He was mum on his future Sunday after the game.If Stafford does not return, the Rams' outlook is completely different, one that's hard to even fathom at this moment. If he does return, it's \"Super Bowl or bust\" once again.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 Super Bowl odds: Seahawks favored over Patriots; Sam Darnold the early MVP favorite over Drake Maye\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill Chris Shula return?Shula has been in a handful of head coaching interviews, including two teams that are still searching: the Las Vegas Raiders and the Arizona Cardinals.Shula, 39, showed a deep, versatile defensive approach this season. He's the grandson of legendary former Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula, the son of former Cincinnati Bengals coach Dave Shula and the nephew of longtime offensive coordinator (and former Alabama coach) Mike Shula. The McVay coaching tree has borne plenty of fruit, and Shula could be next in line.If he is, McVay has a big call to make. Is it an internal promotion? What about Raheem Morris, who has experience on both sides of the ball and as a head coach and was the Rams' defensive coordinator from 2021-23? Speaking of that defense ...\nIt's time to inject the secondary with talentThe Rams have invested heavily (monetarily) in the offense, and they've invested heavily (draft-wise) in the defensive line. It's time to spread some of that investment to the secondary.Los Angeles pieced together its cornerback room with journeymen or castoffs such as Darious Williams, Emmanuel Forbes and Roger McCreary as well as recent homegrown products Cobie Durant and Josh Wallace. It was one of the cheapest cornerback units in the NFL, and it was on the cheapest defense in the NFL.The Rams need to change that. Los Angeles will have ample cap space to make a splash in free agency and also has multiple first-round picks. The Rams struggled against top-flight wide receivers -- Jaxon Smith-Njigba's 10-catch, 153-yard, one-touchdown NFC Championship Game was emblematic of a year-long issue -- and are due for significant personnel turnover at the position with several free agents upcoming.\nIt's past time to fix the special teamsXavier Smith's muffed punt was the only turnover of the NFC Championship Game, and the Seahawks scored a touchdown on the very next play. In a game decided by one possession, that turn of events loomed large. In the wild card win over the Carolina Panthers, the Rams had a punt blocked. In the Week 16 loss to the Seahawks -- a game in which a win would have put them in the driver's seat for the NFC's No. 1 seed -- the Rams allowed a punt return touchdown and missed a late go-ahead field goal attempt.This has been a problem for far too long. The Rams finished 31st in special teams expected points added this season. They were 24th last year and dead last the year before.If Stafford is back and McVay wants to earnestly give him his best shot to win another Super Bowl, fixing the special teams is a must.\nNotable Rams free agents, cap space, draft picksMost of the Rams' core remains under contract for 2026, but there are some notable names set to hit free agency, including ...CB Roger McCrearyS Kamren CurlCB Cobie DurantTE Tyler HigbeeWR Tutu AtwellRT Rob HavensteinMcCreary, Curl and Durant would likely be the top priorities for the Rams to keep; Curl in particular had a very strong season.The Rams are in line to have over $30 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap. That is the ninth-largest figure in the league.\nIt's worth noting, however, that Nacua, Kobie Turner, Byron Young and Steve Avila are all due for extensions. All four were part of the incredible 2023 draft class that breathed life into what was an aging, top-heavy roster at the time. Nacua could very well become the top-paid wide receiver in the NFL, and Turner, Young and Avila have been outstanding in the trenches. Right tackle Warren McClendon also emerged from that draft class, for what it's worth.Speaking of crucial draft classes, the Rams have another one upcoming. Los Angeles owns the 13th pick from the Atlanta Falcons thanks to last year's draft-night trade and its own first-round pick (29th overall). Les Snead has the chance to hit another draft home run, especially considering he currently has more first-round picks in 2026 (two) than he made from 2017-25 (one).Cornerback, safety and potentially linebacker will be top of mind. Offensive line and wide receiver could factor in, too. Maybe a Stafford succession plan plays a role. Regardless, Snead has the chance to make significant upgrades to his roster and, if Stafford is back, have them immediately slot into big roles for a title contender.\n            ",

Vine and UAE Team Emirates XRG teammate Mikkel Bjerg crashed into one of the animals after it hopped into the peloton. Bjerg and three other cyclists -- Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese -- were knocked out of the race because of the crash. The kangaroo was also injured and visibly struggled to make its way out of the road.Vine exchanged bikes with a teammate and rejoined the peloton multiple kilometers down the road. The incident occurred during a high-speed stretch of an eight-lap circuit outside of Adelaide.\nVine entered Stage 5 with a 1:03 lead over Switzerland's Mauro Schmid and won the tour by that exact margin despite the crash. He lost four of his six teammates throughout the tour because of multiple crashes, including the one with the kangaroos. His team announced that Jhonatan Narváez sustained several stable thoracic vertebrae compression fractures in one of those other accidents.\"Everyone asks me what's the most dangerous thing in Australia and I always tell them it's kangaroos,\" Vine said after the race. \"They wait and they hide in the bushes until you can't stop and they jump out in front of you. Point proven today.\n\"Two of them blasted through the peloton when we were doing probably 50 kph and one of them stopped and went left, right, left right, left right and I ended up hitting its backside.\"\n            \n    ",

Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams, with just one total touchdown allowed over this stretch. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The Denver Broncos' season ended just short of reaching Super Bowl LX after falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. This was the latest gut punch for a franchise that limped into this conference title matchup. The high of winning a divisional round thriller against the Buffalo Bills in overtime was almost instantly shattered once word got out that Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury. That thrust backup Jarrett Stidham into the limelight, and while the veteran had his moments, he couldn't get his team to pull off what would've been a miraculous upset. Now, Sean Payton's club is looking into the abyss of the offseason and on the precipice of doing a postmortem of the 2025 season. By most accounts, it was a wildly successful campaign, owning a 14-3 record over the regular season, which was good enough for an NFC West title and the No. 1 seed. As they look to begin preparing for the 2026 season, let's highlight what's on the horizon for the organization. Bo Nix's recovery takes center stage\nNix suffered a broken right ankle in the final moments of that overtime win against the Bills. The second-year quarterback has already undergone surgery to repair the ankle, with the procedure done this week. The early prognosis was that Nix is expected to be sidelined for 12 weeks. If he stays on that recovery timeline, Nix should only miss a small amount of OTAs (if any) and certainly be on track to participate during mandatory minicamp later this spring. That gives Nix plenty of time to get into form before Denver opens up training camp, so this injury is not debilitating enough that it'll bleed into 2026. Does the coaching staff lose key figures?Payton has been able to bring the Broncos back to relevance, but that success may soon result in key figures on his coaching staff being poached. With Denver now eliminated, teams looking for a head coach can now hold in-person interviews with Broncos staffers, including defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and offensive pass game coordinator Davis Webb. Both Joseph and Webb have been popular candidates this hiring cycle, and it would not be shocking to see one or both coaches depart in short order. \nWebb has interest from the Las Vegas Raiders and Buffalo Bills, and neither of those destinations has filled their vacancy to this point. Webb also interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, but the franchise recently hired former Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. While Payton calls the offensive plays, having someone of Webb's acumen departing is hardly ideal for a still-developing offense under Nix. As for Joseph, he has been requested by a large contingent of teams. While some of those organizations have since filled their roles, the Raiders and Arizona Cardinals are two clubs that have expressed interest in Joseph and are still on the hunt for a new coach. Joseph's potential exit could prove to be the biggest X factor of Denver's offseason. A big piece as to why the Broncos made it to the AFC Championship was due to Joseph orchestrating arguably the best defense in the NFL. Denver was fourth in the NFL in scoring and first in the NFL in sacks (including postseason). If Joseph leaves, there's the risk that the unit takes a slight step back. \nBolstering offense around NixA couple of the areas the Broncos should look to address this offseason come on the offensive side of the ball. Specifically, they need to continue surrounding Nix with talent at the skill positions. This season, the Broncos ranked 28th in the NFL in yards per reception from the wide receiver and tight end positions combined. Courtland Sutton was able to lead the team with 1,017 yards receiving, but Denver did struggle to find a top secondary pass-catching option, volleying from Troy Franklin to Pat Bryant to Marvin Mims at receiver. They also never truly got Evan Engram off the ground as Payton's \"Joker\" at the tight end spot. \nMoreover, Denver need to bolster the backfield. The rushing attack cratered after J.K. Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10. Rookie RJ Harvey averaged just 3.7 yards per carry on the year. Their inability to run the football effectively came back to bite them in the AFC Championship, where they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush as a team. With a backup quarterback under center and snowy conditions late in the contest, a capable ground attack could've helped them pull off the upset. Instead, that deficiency helped be their undoing. With Dobbins looking at free agency this offseason, along with a shaky injury history, Denver would be wise to add a back in some capacity this offseason. Offseason assets, free agentsNotable free agents:DL John Franklin-MyersLB Alex SingletonRB J.K. DobbinsS P.J. LockeJa'Quan McMillan (restricted)The Broncos are projected to have roughly $35.4 million in available salary cap space, which is the 12th highest in the NFL.  As for the NFL Draft, Denver has five picks inside the first four rounds, including their own first-round pick.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Championship Sunday began with four teams, but only two remain with tickets punched to Super Bowl LX. It'll be the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks who will battle for the right to hoist the Lombardi Trophy at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, in a couple of weeks.This Super Bowl matchup came together after another chaotic chapter in these NFL playoffs. In the AFC Championship, New England leaned on Drake Maye's legs and a stout defense to outlast the Jarrett Stidham-led Denver Broncos in a game that turned into a snowy affair at Mile High.As for Seattle, the Seahawks reached the Super Bowl after trading haymakers with the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship, where Sam Darnold and Matthew Stafford each threw for over 300 yards and three touchdowns.With Championship Sunday in the books, storylines from both conference title games will begin pouring out as we break down what just unfolded. Below, we're going to highlight some of the major takeaways from these two playoff showdowns and determine which should be taken at face value -- and which are mere overreactions.\nDrake Maye and the Patriots silenced the schedule skepticsOverreaction vs. reality: Overreaction\nThe Patriots are back in the Super Bowl after outlasting some remarkably tough defenses along the way. In fact, Drake Maye became the first quarterback ever to win three playoff games against top-five total defenses (yards allowed) in a single postseason. That puts a sizable hole in the argument from skeptics who have cited an easy schedule as a major reason for New England's success.Does it silence those doubters entirely? Probably not. While Maye and the Patriots offense have managed to outlast several elite units, New England's path also included facing Justin Herbert behind an injured offensive line, C.J. Stroud, who threw four interceptions in the divisional round, and Jarrett Stidham, a backup pressed into action after Bo Nix got hurt.Those circumstances may still leave some questioning just how good the Patriots really are, even though they are now one win away from a championship.\nJarrett Stidham was who we thought he wasOverreaction vs. reality: Reality\nFor a moment, it looked like Stidham was going to follow in the footsteps of Nick Foles and drive a dagger into the heart of the Patriots. After an opening three-and-out, he uncorked a 52-yard pass to Marvin Mims to get Denver inside the New England 10-yard line, then connected with Courtland Sutton for a 6-yard touchdown to take an early 7-0 lead.All the momentum was on Denver's side at that point, and the backup quarterback seemed to be rising to the occasion. But then things came crashing back down to earth.The Broncos went scoreless the rest of the game, and Stidham wasn't nearly as effective as he was on that lone touchdown drive. On that possession, he completed two of his four pass attempts for 58 yards and a touchdown. Outside of it, he went 15 of 27 for just 75 yards.\nHe also had two turnovers that proved to be the nail in Denver's coffin. The first came on a fumble on a backward pass that gave the Patriots possession at the Broncos' 12-yard line.\nTrying to tie the game or take the lead with just over two minutes left in regulation, Stidham threw an interception to Christian Gonzalez on an underthrown ball to Mims. \nComing into this game, there was growing optimism that Stidham would be able to keep things afloat, but that ultimately didn't come to fruition. \nAFC Championship was the bronze medal gameOverreaction vs. reality: Overreaction It's hard to watch the AFC Championship and the NFC Championship and not feel like one conference was a tier above the other. New England was able to come away with a win over Denver to advance to the Super Bowl, but it was by the skin of its teeth, even with the Broncos starting their backup quarterback.Meanwhile, both the Rams and Seahawks looked like championship heavyweights in their slugfest. I wouldn't fault you if your first impression after watching both games was that whoever came out of the NFC would end up winning Super Bowl LX, rendering the AFC Championship a bronze medal game of sorts.While that may be the knee-jerk reaction, it isn't the reality. Seattle does have the betting edge over New England in the early Super Bowl lines, but the Seahawks are only favored by 3.5. That's hardly a number that suggests one conference is heads and shoulders above the other.\nAnd as we've seen time and time again, you can't count out any team that reaches the Super Bowl, so New England shouldn't be viewed as a sacrificial lamb to the NFC champions.\nSean Payton lost Denver the AFC ChampionshipOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionOne of the monumental decisions of the AFC Championship came in the early minutes of the second quarter. Already holding a 7-0 lead, the Broncos were threatening to score after moving the ball to the New England 14-yard line.Faced with a fourth-and-1, Sean Payton elected to keep his offense on the field, and that decision blew up in his face. On the critical down, Stidham was immediately pressured, nearly threw an interception and turned the ball over on downs.\nPayton noted afterward that he kept his offense on the field because he believed his team had the momentum to convert, but it proved costly, particularly with Denver losing by a field goal. Going up 10-0 in a game that saw just 17 total points scored would have been the more prudent move.Still, while it loomed large in a 10-7 loss to New England, it wasn't the sole reason the Broncos came up short.Denver had multiple opportunities to draw even after that turnover on downs, but couldn't execute. On the following drive, Stidham fumbled the football, and the Patriots responded with a touchdown drive to tie the game at seven.\nLater in the contest, Will Lutz missed a 54-yard field goal and had a 45-yard attempt blocked, either of which would've tied the game at 10. So, while passing up the points in that spot will likely be a main talking point, other factors were working against Denver as well.Sam Darnold outdueled Matthew StaffordOverreaction vs. reality: Reality\nFolks have routinely looked at Darnold sideways and questioned whether this late-career resurgence would translate to postseason success. With each game, there's been a thought in the back of people's minds that he'll turn into a pumpkin, like he did with Minnesota in Week 18 and in the first round of the playoffs last year.However, that hasn't happened in his first season with Seattle. In fact, Darnold just outplayed Stafford, the favorite to win NFL MVP, in the NFC Championship Game.\nOn the surface, their numbers were nearly identical.Darnold: 25 of 36, 346 yards passing, 3 TDs, 127.8 passer ratingStafford: 22 of 35, 374 yards passing, 3 TDs, 127.6 passer ratingHowever, Darnold was far superior in key situations, particularly on third down. Stafford failed to complete any of his six pass attempts on third down in the loss. Meanwhile, Darnold completed 6 of 9 on third down for 102 yards and a touchdown.\nIf Darnold can keep that efficiency going, he'll have a great shot at completing his redemption arc with a Super Bowl title.Rams' special teams were their downfallOverreaction vs. reality: RealityAn Achilles heel for the Rams this season has been their special teams unit. Miscues on that side of the ball put them behind the eight-ball throughout the year, and it reared its head again in this playoff loss to Seattle.\nTheir deficiencies were put on full display on a Seahawks punt after the opening possession of the third quarter. Returner Xavier Smith fell backward trying to field the ball, muffed the punt, and Seattle recovered at the Rams 17-yard line.\nOne play later, Darnold connected with Jake Bobo on a touchdown to put L.A. in a 24-13 hole.\nHad the Rams played mistake-free on special teams, we could be talking about them heading to the Super Bowl instead of their season coming to a close.Sean McVay ended the season in a slumpOverreaction vs. reality: RealitySean McVay is widely regarded as one of the best coaches in the NFL, and that remains the case. Still, the Rams head coach did end the season in a relative slump.In the divisional round win over Chicago, McVay made a number of head-scratching decisions late, but it ultimately didn't burn L.A. as the team advanced. In the NFC Championship, however, those curious late-game calls persisted and did contribute to the loss.One of the puzzling decisions came when Los Angeles faced a fourth-and-4 at the Seattle 6-yard line. McVay decided to keep his offense on the field, even though a field goal would've cut the Seahawks' lead to one point with 4:54 remaining in regulation.The Rams were unable to convert and turned the ball over on downs, keeping the deficit at four points.\nOn the ensuing Seattle possession, Cooper Kupp appeared to come up short on a third-down catch, but the officials moved the chains with a first-down ruling. McVay did not challenge the spot, instead calling a timeout after the play.He should've simply challenged the ruling, which may have gone in his favor, and potentially retained his timeout to keep L.A. within range. Instead, the timeout was used, the challenge flag stayed in his pocket, and Seattle moved one step closer to victory.\nOverall, it wasn't a banner final two playoff games for McVay.\n            ",

The NBA announced two Sunday games have been postponed: Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies and the Dallas Mavericks at the Milwaukee Bucks.The Grizzlies game was originally scheduled for 3:30 p.m. ET, but was rescheduled due to inclement weather in Memphis. The Memphis Police Department asked residents to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary, as the city deals with a combination of snow, sleet and ice. The latest updates have Memphis seeing up to three inches of snow, as well as below freezing temperatures across the city. A make-up date for the game has yet to be announced.The Mavericks never even made it Milwaukee for their Sunday night game against the Bucks. Dallas was stuck on the tarmac at the airport for over four hours due to snow and ice in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The Mavericks were scheduled to leave late Saturday night after a 116-110 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. However, the team's flight had been rescheduled to Sunday because of the weather. The make-up game between Dallas and Milwaukee could reportedly take place either Monday, which would cause a back-to-back for Milwaukee, or after the All-Star break on Feb. 19, per the Dallas Morning News. The decision of when the game takes place will be dependent on if the Mavericks can get to Milwaukee later on Sunday or Monday morning. \nThough it wasn't a postponement, the Charlotte Hornets' game against the Washington Wizards on Saturday was moved up six hours because of inclement weather. The same has happened across college basketball.The start time of three ACC men's basketball games were moved up due to the weather on Saturday, including Wake Forest at Duke, North Carolina at Virginia, and Virginia Tech at Louisville. Xavier also moved up its start time against St. John's. No. 21 Georgia has also moved its game against Tennessee from Tuesday to Wednesday.\nOn the women's basketball side, No. 1 ranked UConn moved its matchup against Seton Hall from Sunday to Saturday. No. 14 Baylor's home game against Houston was pushed from Sunday to Tuesday. That's just a couple from an ever-growing list of games being pushed up, or altogether rescheduled due to this storm.\n            \n    ",

The team coached by Cristian Chivu, despite suffering and conceding two goals in the first half to Pisa, in the end managed to win 6-2 at San Siro on Friday, while both Napoli and AC Milan failed to win on Sunday. Antonio Conte's side faced another challenging match and lost 3-0 to Juventus in Turin, basically saying goodbye to their chances of winning the back-to-back Scudettos while AC Milan drew 1-1 against AS Roma. Despite avoiding defeat in their away match in Rome, AC Milan remain five points behind the Nerazzurri, but they could benefit in the coming weeks from the fact that Chivu's side are facing a crucial and demanding month in their Champions League campaign.Here's what to know:\nInter atop the standingsInter came out of the weekend as the leading candidates for the Scudetto and increased their gap on both AC Milan and Napoli. The side coached by Conte are now probably excluded from the chance of winning the Serie A title for the second season in a row, while Inter are now in the best position possible but will also likely have to face the Champions League playoffs next month, increasing the matches they will have to play in a key month for both Serie A and European campaigns. Chivu was able to rotate his team in the past weeks and some new faces emerged as crucial, starting with Italian young star Francesco Pio Esposito, who scored a key goal against Pisa and showed again to be an important player for Inter and potentially for Italy in the near future. The 18-year old was able to find his space in this team despite playing with some world-class stars such as Marcus Thuram, Lautaro Martinez and Yoan Bonny. Watch out for him. Napoli facing issuesConte is facing a difficult moment at Napoli, especially due to injuries. The Azzurri were not able to rotate as much as the Italian coach was hoping to and now Napoli are nine points behind Inter in the Serie A standings. That's a gap that will be difficult to overcome. The Italian manager was unhappy with the performance of the Azzurri that lost 3-0 in Turin against Juventus but also underlined once again how difficult the season is going. Conte was forced to play with new signing Giovane in the second half after the club decided to loan Noa Lang to Galatasaray and sold Lorenzo Lucca to Nottingham Forest. Speaking to DAZN after the match, Conte said, \"For the first time in my career, I had to play a player I had never even seen before. Now this has happened to me as well. I haven't trained him for even a single minute.\" Napoli will face Chelsea on Wednesday at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona live on Paramount+ in a key match that might also affect the future of the Italian coach as the Azzurri are at risk of being eliminated in the league phase.\nAS Roma help Chivu \nThe AS Roma draw against AC Milan helped Inter to increase their gap with the city rivals but also meant Gian Piero Gasperini's team are now in third place, tied on points with Napoli behind Inter and the Rossoneri. Week by week, AS Roma are improving, and new signing Robinio Vaz showed Gasperini's vision for this team in the long term -- young players who can adapt to his attacking style, something his team probably lacked during the opening months of his stint in Rome. It's too early to understand the impact of the new signing, but even if he only played a few minutes, he looks way more tactically involved than other attacking players that are set to leave the team in the summer, such as Artem Dovbyk or Evan Ferguson. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots tied an NFL playoff record on Sunday when they sent out Andres Borregales for a long field goal attempt just before halftime of the AFC Championship Game in Denver. With one second left to play in the second quarter and the Patriots sitting at Denver's 45-yard line, coach Mike Vrabel had two options: he could send out Drake Maye for a Hail Mary, or he could send out Borregales for a long kick. Vrabel ended up going for the 63-yard field goal, which was notable, because it tied the NFL record for longest field goal attempt in a playoff game. Going into Sunday, there had only been TWO attempts of 60 yards or longer in NFL postseason history. Rams kicker Greg Zuerlein attempted a 63-yarder against the Cowboys during a 2018 divisional round game (he missed).49ers kicker Mike Cofer attempted a 60-yarder against the Vikings during a 1989 divisional round game (he missed).Not only did the Patriots tie the record for longest field goal attempt, but Borregales could have set the NFL record for longest field goal, but he ended up sending his kick wide left. \nBorregales, who was a sixth-round pick for the Patriots in the 2025 NFL Draft, had a strong rookie year, and he was 4 of 4 during the regular season on kicks of 50 yards or longer. Trying a long kick in Denver definitely makes some sense, because some of the longest kicks in NFL history have been hit there. Of the 16 field goals of 63 yards or longer in NFL history, three of them have come in Denver. Although 60-yard field goals seem to happen every other week now, there still has NEVER been one in the NFL postseason. During the 2025 season, there were six kicks of 60 yards or longer, including an NFL record 67-yard field goal by Cam Little, but that hasn't translated to success in the playoffs. The longest kick in NFL postseason history is 58 yards, which has been done just twice. The Dolphins' Pete Stoyanovich set the record with a 58-yarder during a 17-16 win over the Chiefs in the 1990 wild card round. The Panthers' Graham Gano tied that mark in a 31-26 wild card loss to the Saints that was played back in January 2019. \nBorregales did hit a 23-yard field goal in the third quarter to give the Patriots a 10-7 lead. With a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line, we have a tight game in Denver. If you want to know the latest scores and stats, be sure to check out our live blog here. \n            ",

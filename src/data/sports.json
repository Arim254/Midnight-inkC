    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The lower-body injury that Canadian hockey star Sidney Crosby sustained in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics will have a significant impact on the NHL season. The Pittsburgh Penguins on Wednesday placed Crosby on injured reserve and announced that the center will miss a minimum of four weeks as a result.Crosby sustained the injury in the semifinals of the Olympic tournament. An awkward sequence along the boards in Canada's win over Czechia led to his departure from the contest, and he was unavailable for the gold medal game against the United States.Crosby took a hit from Radko Gudas and Martin Necas in the semifinal round that appeared to hurt him and required assistance from the Team Canada medical staff. After examination on the bench, Crosby departed for the locker room and carried a noticeable limp as he walked into the tunnel.A prolonged absence upon the resumption of the NHL season will force Crosby to watch the Penguins' playoff push from the bench. Pittsburgh will return to action Thursday against the New Jersey Devils at 29-15-12 on the year and in second place in the Metro Division. With the Penguins set to spend at least the next month without their leading scorer, they could fall out of the Stanley Cup picture entirely.\nYear 21 in the NHL has been yet another outstanding one for the future first-ballot Hall of Famer. He netted 27 goals and racked up 32 assists before the Olympic break, putting him on pace to potentially score at least 90 points for the fourth consecutive season. He has been far and away the most productive player on the ice for the Penguins at age 38.Not only could Crosby's absence have devastating ramifications for the Penguins over the final weeks of the season, but it also did nothing to help Canada in the final stage of Olympic competition. While his injury may have been a rallying moment for the Canadians in their comeback win over Czechia in the semifinals, they could have used his presence in the loss to Team USA.Crosby, a three-time Stanley Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist in 2014, said that Canada \"deserved better\" than its 2-1 overtime loss to the Americans. He also said it was his decision alone to sit out of the gold medal game.\n\"I was pretty close,\" Crosby said. \"I mean, ultimately I wasn't able to go out there and do what I needed to do in order to help the team, so at that point, you've got to make a decision that's best for the group. Not an easy one. But, you know, that's hockey.\"\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Cincinnati Bengals are in decision-making mode with edge rusher Trey Hendrickson, who will enter free agency if he's not franchise tagged before the upcoming March 3 deadline. Tagging Hendrickson gives the Bengals a chance at landing a return, potentially in the form of a draft pick or two via trade, or trying to sign the All-Pro end to an extension before the start of the 2026 season.The clock is ticking from the NFL combine for a franchise that already experienced last summer's holdout headache with Hendrickson coming off of his career-year in 2024 after posting 17.5 sacks. Hendrickson played in only seven games last fall due to injury, as his production diminished.\"All trades are difficult,\" Bengals director of player personnel Duke Tobin said this week from Indianapolis. \"You got to find a partner and you have to find somebody that you have to have some cooperation with your players that you're talking about this with. Trades can be complicated and that hypothetical scenario would be very complicated.\"Tobin said the Bengals have resources to \"attack the offseason\" and acknowledged all options are on the table with Hendrickson. If he's tagged and is not traded, Cincinnati would owe Hendrickson around $30 million next season, then could tag him again next spring for an enhanced cost if an extension is not signed.\nTobin has no interest in showing the Bengals' hand with their pending decision from the combine.\"He didn't have the year he wanted this year. We didn't have the year we wanted this year,\" Tobin said. \"Those are factors and we'll see where we go from there. But in terms of how we're gonna deploy the tag, if we are going to, that's not something I'm gonna talk about here.\"If Hendrickson is not tagged and becomes a free agent, that would provide the Bengals with considerable cap space to go add defensive help. The Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers are two teams projected to be potential landing spots if Cincinnati chooses to go that route.\n\"There's a connection with the Colts and their defensive coordinator, Lou Anarumo, who was the defensive coordinator when he was with the Cincinnati Bengals. History there with the coaching staff ... so that would make sense,\" CBS Sports' Tyler Sullivan said this month on CBS Sports HQ. \"You look at the 49ers, they had the fewest sacks in the NFL last season. Obviously, lot of that due to injury, but you continue to add (pieces) to attack the quarterback when you're in a division with Matthew Stafford and Sam Darnold. So to me, Trey Hendrickson in San Fran would make sense as well.\"\n            ",

He's scored at least 15 points in five of his last six games, not including the Lakers' contest, as the second-year guard and No. 4 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft appears to be feeling more confident in the offense. The Spurs play the Raptors, who could have tired legs in the second half of a back-to-back, as the model projects Castle for 15.9 points on Wednesday. Back Castle with the latest Kalshi promo code, which gives new users a a $10 bonus after $10 in trades:Kevin Durant, Rockets 6 or more rebounds ($0.45 per share)Amen Thompson, a 6-foot-7 guard, is out for the Rockets, and he averages 7.6 rebounds per game, which opens up more rebounding opportunities for Durant. Even with Thompson in the lineup, Durant has at least six rebounds in two of three games since the NBA All-Star Break, with five boards in the other. He's averaging 5.4 rebounds per game this season, but the model likes his chances at getting at least that sixth rebound with Thompson out in a matchup against a 13-46 Kings team. The Kings are 30th in the league in 3-point shooting and 29th in two-point shooting percentage, so there should be plenty of rebounding opportunities for Durant. The model projects Durant for 6.8 rebounds. Back Durant with the latest Kalshi promo code, which gives new users a a $10 bonus after $10 in trades:Celtics more than 116.5 points scored vs. Nuggets ($0.44 per share)The Nuggets have allowed at least 117 points in six of their last nine games, and the Celtics have broken the 120-point margin in two of their last four contests. Boston averages just below this total for the season at 115 ppg, and the Nuggets are allowing 116.3 ppg. Denver allowed 128 points to Golden State on Sunday, and even in two of the three games in which its opponents failed to reach 117 points, the Nuggets allowed at least 114 points. The model projects the Celtics to score 120 points on Wednesday, and especially given this price, it sees solid value in backing Boston to score more than 116.5 points. Back the Celtics with the latest Kalshi promo code, which gives new users a a $10 bonus after $10 in trades:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Over the weekend, the Los Angeles Lakers honored legendary coach and current Miami Heat executive Pat Riley with a statue outside of Crypto.com Arena. The eight-foot tall, 510-pound bronze sculpture captures Riley in a triumphant pose with one arm raised above his head and dressed in his iconic Armani suit. Few coaches in NBA history, if any, have been as stylish as Riley, who commanded the sidelines in an array of designer suits and alligator belts. It was no surprise, then, that he had some thoughts about the current fashion trends in the league. \"I wish it went back to coat and ties,\" Riley said of the NBA coaches' dress code. \"I think an audience wants to see somebody on the sidelines who looks like a leader, dresses like a leader, acts like a leader.\"\nRiley's comments quickly went viral and generated plenty of conversation across the sports media landscape. One of the more notable takes came from Stephen A. Smith, who said on ESPN's First Take that he was \"so happy\" Riley brought up the topic and called out the league's coaches and players for \"dressing like y'all shopping at Target or something.\"\nHistorically, coaches wore suits on the sidelines, but the dress code was relaxed in the NBA's COVID bubble in 2020 due to the heat and humidity in Orlando. Once the coaches were allowed to wear NBA licensed polo shirts the bubble, they haven't looked back. The current rules state that head coaches and assistants must wear \"business attire\" during games, which includes quarter-zip tops, a new favorite among staffs around the league. Would the coaches ever go back to suits? Current Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers, who became an NBA head coach in 1999 and wore suits on the sidelines for two decades, has heard a possible solution: Have coaches dress up in the playoffs.\"It's a tough one because quarter zips are so comfortable, you know? They're so easy to wear,\" said Rivers, who played for Riley for two-plus seasons with the New York Knicks, and credits the Hall of Famer with convincing him to join the coaching ranks instead of becoming a broadcaster.\n\"I will say this and I brought this up to someone (and) that's going to go through the chain, I do think it wouldn't be a bad idea during playoffs because the most you're going to travel for is two games and wearing suits in the playoffs shows the significance of the playoffs,\" Rivers added. \"Easy to travel (with suits). I would be in favor of that one, other than I would have to start working out again because none of my suits would fit anymore.\"The coaches' desire to remain casual is as much about avoiding the stress and logistical hassle of packing half a dozen different suits, shirts and ties for an extended road trip as it is about their comfort on game day. Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle, who stepped down as the head of the National Basketball Coaches Association earlier this season, told The Athletic last summer that the most recent vote among coaches on the dress code was \"well over 80% to 20% that is in favor of what we're doing presently, and it's closer to 85 or 90[%].\" Whether that changes remains to be seen, but it's clear that Riley's comments have everyone thinking. That includes Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who succeeded Riley in Miami in 2008, and has worked with him for nearly three decades. \n\"Pat and I debate about this all the time. We went to the Hall of Fame this year for (Heat owner) Micky Arison and so I had to wear back-to-back nights of suits, and I swear that was all Pat was talking about,\" Spoelstra said Tuesday. \"He's like, 'See, you like great, you look presentable.' And I said, 'Well, I had to go get these just for this weekend, and I don't plan on wearing them again until the next Hall of Fame event we get to go to.'\"\"But I can see the arguments both ways. I think as long as we look professional, look different than the players, that's great. I think it's becoming a little bit different anyways in corporate America. But then I also see Pat's point of view,\" Spoelstra continued. \"When I see the footage of him from the Lakers to the Knicks to the Heat, he did look sharp. But he wore suits differently than us mortals. We just didn't look the same as the way he looked. That was an iconic Armani look.\"Erik Spoelstra in the pre- and post-2020 world for NBA coach attire. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Spoelstra also joked that Riley gave him a few suits during his days as an assistant coach, which taught him an immediate lesson about fashion. \n\"I looked like the lead singer for the Talking Heads [David Byrne],\" Spoelstra said. \"I didn't realize I had to tailor the suits.\"Would current coaches make the same faux pas if they had to go back to wearing suits? Or would Riley's spirit inspire them? Heat guard Tyler Herro, one of the league's most adventurous dressers, would like to find out. \"I think they should go back to [suits],\" Herro said. \"Make the coaches do a little bit more, dress a little harder, put some swag into it. I want to see which coach really got some swag.\"\n            ",

Ferrelli re-entered the transfer portal and committed to Ole Miss after initially landing at Clemson.\"We have a broken system, and if there are no consequences for tampering, then we have no rules and we have no governance,\" Swinney said last month.Within a screenshot of the memo posted on social media, Duncan identified tampering as falling under the label of \"communications of any kind are not permitted with a student-athlete at another school -- or any other representatives of their interests, including agents -- before that student-athlete entered the NCAA transfer portal.\"\nSwinney said he previously warned the Rebels that he would blow the whistle on what he considered under-the-table recruiting if Golding and Ole Miss failed to back off the former California linebacker, who signed with Clemson on Jan. 7 and moved from the West Coast to South Carolina four days later.Swinney alleged that Golding texted Ferrelli a photo of a \"$1 million contract\" and asked about his buyout at Clemson.Previously, Golding and Ole Miss pointed fingers elsewhere and were concerned over tampering during the College Football Playoff with fear former Rebels coach Lane Kiffin was targeting players to join him at LSU. Numerous Ole Miss players left for LSU even after reportedly signing rev-share contracts, including pass-rusher Princewill Umanmielen.\nThese are not the only instances of tampering allegations since the end of college football's 2025 season, though certainly the most public.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL will be holding a total of nine international games in 2026 which is the most the league has ever held in a single-season. During his annual press conference before the Super Bowl, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell revealed that the league's eventual goal is to hold a total of 16 international games per year so that all 32 teams end up playing one game outside of the country each season. \"That's an important mark to shoot for and I think we're on our way.\" Goodell said.Although 16 is the target, we're not quite there yet. For the upcoming season, there will be nine games and we'll be tracking which teams are expected to play in those games. The 2026 slate will include three cities that will be hosting a game for the first time in Rio De Janeiro, Paris and Melbourne, Australia. The league will also be returning to both Mexico City and Munich, two cites that didn't host a game last year, but have hosted in the past.\nThe NFL revealed on Feb. 24 that Detroit will be playing in Munich. The Lions haven't played an international game since 2015, which is the second-longest drought in the NFL behind only the Cowboys, who haven't been sent out of the country since 2014. However, both of those streaks will be ending this year with both teams heading out of the United States for a game.For the fourth straight year, the NFL will also be scheduling one team to play back-to-back international games and this year, that team will be Jacksonville. The Jaguars will play at both Wembley Stadium and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2026. The Jags' had to play back-to-back games in London in both 2023 and 2024 and they went 3-1 in those games. The Commanders will also be hosting a game in London, the league announced on Feb. 25. \n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Top 100 NFL free agents for 2026: Market light on big-name talent, but some stars to be had\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith nine international games this year, that means there will be 18 slots to fill, and the NFL has slowly been filling those slots over the past few weeks.Here's what we know about the international schedule so far:Melbourne -- Rams vs. 49ers (Expected to be played in Week 1)Rio de Janeiro -- Cowboys vs. TBA (Likely to be played in Week 3, per SBJ)Paris -- Saints vs. TBA (Likely to be played in Week 7, per French media)Mexico City -- 49ers vs. TBA  (Will be played in Week 13 or 14)London -- Jaguars vs. TBA (Played at Wembley Stadium)London -- Jaguars vs. TBA (Played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium)London -- Commanders vs. TBA (Played at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium)Munich -- Lions vs. TBAMadrid -- TBA vs. TBAYou may have noticed that the 49ers are on their twice and that's because they're set to become the first NFL team ever to play two international games in the same season that won't be played in back-to-back weeks.When it comes to the game in Germany, the NFL announced that the Lions will be \"one of the participating teams,\" so it's currently unclear if Detroit will be the home team or the visiting team.\nAlthough there are nine spots still up in the air, we do know of at least one other team that will be playing abroad this year.Falcons. The Falcons announced in December that they would be playing an international game this year and that they would be serving as the home team in that game, so it looks like they'll either be the host team in Madrid or serve as the home team against the Lions in Munich. The Falcons were the visiting team against the Colts for the NFL's first game ever in Berlin last season.There are also some international rumors swirling around, so let's check those out.International rumorsIt's not guaranteed that these teams will be playing abroad, but there are some rumors floating around involving at least two different teams.\nGiants. There's a report that Giants will be playing an international game this year, so that will fill one more slot. It's not clear if that's a home game or an away game for New York. The Giants are scheduled to play the Commanders, Cowboys and Lions on the road, so they could certainly be the road team in an international game. The Giants could also end up being the home team for the Jaguars' game at Tottenham Hotspur. Browns. One French media outlet has reported that the the Browns will be facing the Saints in France. This is the outlet that originally broke the news of the Paris game back in January, so it's certainly possible that the Browns could be headed to France, but you probably shouldn't go booking any flights for this game until the NFL makes an official announcement.The NFL's international series started in 2007 with just one game in London. Now, nearly 20 years later, the league will be holding nine games that will be played all around the world. The NFL has truly turned into a global game.The full international schedule will be unveiled in May when the NFL releases the 2026 schedule. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Once again, NFL front offices and evaluators will descend upon Lucas Oil Stadium to take one of their first glances at some of the top prospects as the league gears up for the 2026 NFL Draft. This is an opportunity for prospects to flash their potential and highlight some elite traits that could help their stock shoot up before we land in Pittsburgh for the draft later this spring. One of the marquee events of this multi-day spectacle is the 40-yard dash. While straight-line speed isn't exactly indicative of whether these prospects will go on to have star NFL careers, this event does garner a ton of attention, and it certainly will again in 2026. Of course, we'll also be monitoring this year's crop of prospects to see if any of them can rival Xavier Worthy's record-setting 4.21-second 40-yard dash he registered back in 2024. That gallop by Worthy bested former record-holder John Ross by just .01 seconds, so these margins are razor-thin. \n        \n            \n                Who are the top offensive prospects entering the 2026 NFL combine? Top 5 by position\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs the 2026 class tries to write themselves in the record book, let's take a look at who currently resides inside the top 10 fastest 40-yard dash times, and chronicle how their NFL careers have panned out. T10. Henry Ruggs III, WR, 4.27 in 2020Ruggs ran the fastest time of his entire draft class in 2020, posting a 4.27-second 40-yard dash that has him tied for the 10th-fastest all-time. The Las Vegas Raiders then selected the Alabama product with the No. 12 overall pick at the 2020 NFL Draft. \nDespite being the first receiver off the board, Ruggs' career did not pan out. During his rookie season, he posted a modest stat line of 26 catches, 452 yards receiving, and two touchdowns over 13 games played. The following year, he had 24 catches for 469 yards and two touchdowns through seven games before being released by the Raiders in early November of 2021 following a fatal car accident that resulted in the death of a woman and her dog. Ruggs was later charged with driving under the influence, resulting in death, and reckless driving after rear-ending 23-year-old Tina Tintor at 156 miles per hour. Ruggs is currently serving three-to-10 years in a Nevada prison due to the accident. T10. Stanford Routt, CB, 4.27 in 2005Routt, a prospect coming out of the University of Houston and an All-American track athlete, ran a 4.27-second 40-yard dash during the 2005 NFL Scouting Combine. That helped the corner become a second-round pick (No. 38 overall) of the then-Oakland Raiders at the 2005 NFL Draft. Routt would go on to play seven seasons in the NFL, mostly with the Raiders (2005-2011). With the franchise, he started in 53 of his 110 games played and totaled 244 tackles and 10 interceptions. His final season in the NFL was split between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans, during which he started in seven of his nine games. T10. Marquise Goodwin, WR, 4.27 in 2013The former Texas Longhorn was another two-sport athlete, a standout in track and field who even competed in the 2012 Olympics. At the combine, his 4.27-second 40-yard dash was the third-fastest ever recorded at the time. Goodwin went on to be selected by the Buffalo Bills in the third round (No. 78 overall) of the 2013 NFL Draft. While he never leapt into superstardom, Goodwin proved to be a solid piece to various offenses throughout his career, making stops with six different franchises over the course of a decade in the league. His most productive season came in 2017 when he posted career highs in receptions (56) and receiving yards (962) with the San Francisco 49ers. Goodwin last played in 2023 and has 191 catches for 3,090 yards and 18 touchdowns over his career. \nT6. Jerome Mathis, WR, 4.26 in 2005Mathis recorded a 4.26 40-yard dash at the 2005 combine, which helped the Hampton receiver become a fourth-round pick (No. 114) of the Houston Texans. The Virginia native did burst onto the scene as a rookie, particularly for his prowess on special teams, earning first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors as a kick returner. However, a left foot injury during the Pro Bowl sidelined him for his entire sophomore season. Mathis then played just three games in 2007 before dealing with more injuries and did not play in the NFL again. After a quick offseason stint with Washington, he dipped into the CFL and Arena Football League. T6. Tariq Woolen, CB, 4.26 in 2022Woolen ran a 4.26 40-yard dash at the 2022 combine, which was tied for the third-best in Combine history and the fastest for a player over six feet. The UTSA product was then selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the fifth round (No. 153) of the 2022 NFL Draft. \nWoolen has gone on to be a highly productive player. As a rookie, the corner was the co-leader in interceptions, which helped him to a Pro Bowl nod after his first season in the league. More recently, Woolen helped Seattle win Super Bowl LX. Through 64 career regular-season games (53 starts), Woolen has 203 tackles, 53 passes defended, and 12 interceptions. \n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL combine: Garrett Nussmeier, CJ Allen among 10 prospects with something to prove in Indianapolis\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nT6. Dri Archer, RB, 4.26 in 2014Archer clocked in at 4.26 seconds during his 40-yard dash at the 2014 NFL Scouting Combine. The 5-foot-8 speedster out of Kent State was then selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the third round (No. 97) of the draft. As a rookie, the running back didn't factor much in the ground game, logging just 10 carries for 40 yards over 12 games. Primarily, Archer worked in the kick return game over his lone two seasons in Pittsburgh. He was waived in early November of the 2015 season and had cups of coffee with the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills, but did not play in the NFL again. T6. DJ Turner, CB, 4.26 in 2023The Michigan corner posted a blazing 4.26 40-yard dash at the 2023 NFL Scouting Combine, which helped him become a second-round pick (No. 60) of the Cincinnati Bengals. \nAfter a 2024 season that was cut short due to injury, Turner is coming off a career year with the Bengals in 2025. He started in 16 of the club's 17 games played, and the third-year corner posted 40 tackles, 18 pass breakups, and two interceptions. In coverage, he allowed a 47.9% completion rate and just a 75.6 passer rating against. \nT4. Rondel Menendez, WR, 4.24 in 1999At the time of his 40-yard dash, no one had run a faster time than Menendez, registering a 4.24-second time back in 1999. However, that record-setting 40-yard dash didn't do much to boost his draft stock, as he was selected in the seventh round (No. 247) by the Atlanta Falcons. Menendez tore his meniscus during the preseason leading up to his rookie year. He later would have short stints with Miami, Indianapolis, Washington, and Philadelphia, but did not compile any NFL stats. T4. Chris Johnson, RB, 4.24 in 2008Chris Johnson knotted himself with Menendez atop the combine record books with his 4.24 40-yard dash back in 2008. The East Carolina running back was then selected with the 24th overall pick by the Tennessee Titans, where he'd go on to have a stellar tenure. \nAs a rookie, Johnson rushed for 1,228 yards and nine touchdowns, earning him a Pro Bowl nomination and a second-place finish for Offensive Rookie of the Year. His second season in the league, however, lives in NFL lore as Johnson set the single-season rushing record with 2,006 yards, earning himself the nickname CJ2K. Johnson had 2,509 total yards and 16 total touchdowns from scrimmage that season, which led him to being named the Offensive Player of the Year. Johnson is fourth all-time on Tennessee's rushing yards list with 7,965 for his career. After six seasons with the Titans, Johnson had brief stints with the Jets and Cardinals before announcing his retirement in November 2018.\n3. Kalon Barnes, CB, 4.23 in 2022Barnes was just .01 away from tying himself with John Ross for the record, running a 4.23 40-yard dash in 2022. Still, his time remains the fastest for any defensive player in combine history. Despite that speed, the Baylor corner was drafted in the seventh round (No. 242) by the Carolina Panthers. \nBarnes was waived by Carolina during final roster cuts after his first training camp. He then signed with the Dolphins' practice squad and was later signed to the Minnesota Vikings' active roster. He played two games (on special teams) to end the 2022 season. From there, Barnes has been a practice squad player and, most recently, has been in the United Football League and Canadian Football League.  2. John Ross, WR, 4.22 in 2017In 2017, John Ross stood alone, breaking the 40-yard dash record with a 4.22 sprint at the combine. That record-breaking run helped lead the Washington receiver to become the No. 9 overall pick at the 2017 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. \nDespite that high draft billing and record 40 time, Ross turned into a bust. He was limited to just three games as a rookie due to injury and poor play. The following year, he played in 13 games (10 starts) and recorded 210 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns. Ross' third season in the league did look like it would prove to be his breakout, particularly after posting 11 catches for 270 yards and three touchdowns over the first two games of the regular season. However, he later landed on injured reserve due to a shoulder injury. After a stint with the Giants in 2021, Ross was effectively out of the league for two years. He signed with the Chiefs in the winter of 2023, then informed the team he was retiring, only to return months later. He last played for the Eagles in 2024, registering one reception. 1. Xavier Worthy, WR, 4.21 seconds in 2024Worthy lept over Ross and notched a new combine record with his 4.21-second 40-yard dash in 2024. The Texas Longhorn was then selected in the first round (No. 28) of the 2024 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs.\nAt the time he was drafted, Worthy was looked at as a possible replacement for Tyreek Hill, giving Kansas City back a true vertical threat in the passing game for Patrick Mahomes. While Worthy has been a solid player for K.C., he hasn't reached superstar heights through two seasons. As a rookie, he caught 59 balls for 638 yards and six touchdowns. In the playoffs, it looked like Worthy was starting to emerge, particularly during Kansas City's loss to the Eagles in Super Bowl LIX, where he had 157 yards receiving and two touchdowns on eight receptions. This season, however, Worthy's production was a bit more modest, finishing with 532 receiving yards and one touchdown through 14 games (missed time with a shoulder injury). \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mock drafts are surfacing in rapid succession ahead of the 2026 NFL Combine, a final opportunity for prospects to turn heads before April's landmark offseason event. Running Feb. 23 through March 2 in Indianapolis, the combine will host 319 players -- including 16 quarterbacks -- with NFL coaches, scouting types and front office staff looking on.Numerous players in recent years have used the week to rise in draft rankings through individual workouts and interviews and there are many athletes this cycle anxious to boost their stock. Testing results don't trump production and film, but they do give NFL franchises a more complete picture of a prospect's athletic profile and where they should be on the big board later this spring.Here are 10 players to keep an eye on inside Lucas Oil Stadium who could rise in pre-draft discussions:Garrett Nussmeier, QB, LSUOne of 11 former Tigers to receive a combine invite, Nussmeier has first-round ability when he's playing at his best. However, the level of inconsistency is the issue. Last season's regression from potential No. 1 overall quarterback billing to a probable Day 2 selection means he's going to need to convince evaluators he's worth moving into the first round with a stellar performance. Too often at LSU, Nussmeier's gunslinger mentality led to negative plays and poor decisions. He was roughed up behind an under-performing offensive front, too. Currently, Nussmeier ranks as the third-best quarterback available behind Fernando Mendoza and Ty Simpson.\nKC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&MPrimarily starring from the slot, Concepcion is one of those versatile playmakers offensive coordinators covet. Get creative, put the football in his hands and let Concepcion do his thing on the boundary. A high-volume receiver at NC State for two seasons before his lone campaign with the Aggies, he averaged a career-best 15.1 yards per catch as a junior. Carnell Tate, Jordyn Tyson, Omar Cooper Jr. and others have gotten more pre-draft buzz at wideout, but Conception may lock in first-round love over the next week and change.Kenyon Sadiq, TE, OregonWhen Oregon quarterback Dante Moore needed a big play last season on third down or in the red zone, Sadiq's number was called as the Ducks' most dependable threat. He caught a team-high 51 passes for 560 yards and eight touchdowns, showing a penchant for getting open at various levels. Sadiq is cut like an edge rusher and moves as well as any tight end in this class. A run in the low 4.5s should put Sadiq in guaranteed TE1 territory.\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026 is here: What to know about the schedule, draft order and top prospects\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJalon Kilgore, S, South CarolinaRemember former Gamecocks safety Nick Emmanwori's freakish showing at last year's NFL Combine? It was enough to motivate the Seattle Seahawks to take him at No. 35 overall in the second round, arguably the steal of the cycle, given his rookie season production. Kilgore's current projection is somewhere in the mid-round range and he's two inches shorter than Emmanwori at 6-foot-1, but his athleticism and ball skills are comparable. Kilgore is competing with South Carolina secondary mate Brandon Cisse at cornerback to be the Gamecocks' highest selection in April.\nDrew Allar, QB, Penn StateWhen it comes to tools, there's nothing missing from Allar's bag. Arm strength and size are top end this cycle, but the former five-star has plays on film that make some question his true ceiling. Allar threw 49 touchdown passes over his first two seasons as Penn State's starter before missing the second half of the 2025 campaign with an injury. Allar bypassed a potential first-round opportunity following his junior season after leading the Nittany Lions to the College Football Playoff semifinals in hopes of winning a title. It didn't happen and as it stands, Allar needs a memorable combine showing to justify early-round billing.Bud Clark, S, TCUClark's not a burner and isn't going to wow scouts with his speed, but his knack for ball-tracking and making plays in coverage is a flex NFL teams should covet in the later rounds of the draft. Clark followed 11 career interceptions from his spot in centerfield with the Horned Frogs with a notable week at the Senior Bowl, strengthening his stock. Clark is not ranked within the top 10 prospects at the safety position per CBS Sports, but that could change after the combine.CJ Allen, LB, GeorgiaThere's no player on Georgia's defense that coach Kirby Smart trusted more last season than Allen, a team captain and thumper at linebacker. Few are better this cycle at diagnosing plays and getting to gaps with fluidity. Hip tightness and minor struggles in coverage are the drawbacks for Allen, who can reverse some of those opinions with a commendable effort during combine drills.\nMikail Kamara, Edge, IndianaA high-value option after the first round, Kamara's best film with the Hoosiers came in 2024, following a 10-sack season with those numbers trailing off considerably (two sacks) during last fall's title run. He's not as physically impressive as most pass rushers this class, but moves well as a 'tweener of sorts' at 6-foot-1, 265 pounds. If his combine numbers are off the charts in Indianapolis, the narrative changes a bit.Taylen Green, QB, Arkansas While he would've liked a better overall showing in Mobile, teams did get a better understanding of Green's processing skills coming from the Razorbacks' RPO-heavy offensive scheme under Bobby Petrino. At 6-6, 225 pounds, there should be no worries with durability after Green rushed for nearly 800 yards last season in the SEC. Green is a bit of an unknown from a developmental perspective since he's never played in an NFL-style offense geared toward read progression, but there's enough to like athletically as a depth-chart option in the middle rounds.Davison Igbinosun, CB, Ohio StateA three-year starter for the Buckeyes after transferring from Ole Miss, Igbinosun did not allow a touchdown pass in coverage last fall, but got handsy at times. Penalty-avoidance is an area he'll need to clean up at the next level and certainly a coachable tactic. There's a chance to impress during individual drills in Indianapolis for a player with great size at the position (6-2, 200) and ample elite reps at college football's highest level.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ready or not, the 2026 NFL Draft is going to be here before you know it. With that in mind, let's get reacquainted with some of the names we could hear early on in the first round later this spring in Pittsburgh. That includes Arizona State wide receiver Jordyn Tyson, who could very well be the top player taken at his position. CBS Sports' Mike Renner has Tyson as his top wideout in this 2026 class, and it's not hard to see why. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound receiver has the ability to be a true No. 1 within an NFL offense and a lethal red zone threat. That said, Tyson does have quite a bit of variance when it comes to where he'll be taken at the draft, despite being a strong all-around prospect. While the ability is there, Tyson has a bit of an injury history, missing time in three-straight seasons. Questions about his durability could prove to be enough of a red flag for NFL front offices that could see Tyson's stock dip a bit lower than his talent would suggest. \nThat, in turn, creates a fascinating and wide window of potential landing spots for the receiver. Below, we'll dive into a handful of destinations that could make sense in the first round. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans Saints (No. 8)The Saints hit pay dirt when they selected Tyler Shough in the second round of last year's draft, and the rising sophomore quarterback does look like someone the franchise can begin building around. One way they can do that is by giving him another weapon opposite of Chris Olave with Tyson. After Olave, the receiver group for New Orleans is thin and unproven, so this offense is in dire need of some playmakers. Moreover, Olave himself is entering the final year of his rookie deal on the fifth-year option, so his future beyond 2026 is uncertain, making an addition like Tyson that much more vital for the young quarterback. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City Chiefs (No. 9)The Chiefs offense has started to look tired over the last few seasons and bottomed out in 2025. While all the attention is now being paid to Patrick Mahomes and his ACL recovery, the offense was sluggish even when he was going at full tilt. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love has been a popular selection at this spot, but there are no guarantees that he'll be available to Kansas City when they are on the clock. If he's not there, they'll need to pivot to another figure to push the offense's ceiling higher, and Tyson has that ability. He'd not only bring some much-needed talent to the receiver room, but he could be one of the central pieces for Andy Reid as they continue to prepare for the post-Travis Kelce era of the offense. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins (No. 11)Miami cleaned house recently, ridding itself of several notable players from the previous regime, including wideout Tyreek Hill. Not only are the Dolphins now without the likes of Hill, but fellow pass catcher Jaylen Waddle has been the subject of trade rumors as well. Even if Waddle stays aboard, the Dolphins need to improve the talent pool at the receiver position for whoever is going to be under center for them. It's unlikely they use this selection to bring in a quarterback, as there are no true viable options to take in this class. That said, Tyson would be a worthwhile addition to help boost the skill position group and make life easier for the QB-to-be-named-later. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Baltimore Ravens (No. 14)Baltimore has gotten into a rhythm over the last few years of bringing in big-name wide receivers who are on the last leg of their careers. Those efforts have largely been unsuccessful, most recently ranging from Odell Beckham Jr. to DeAndre Hopkins. Instead of going down that road again, the Ravens should turn to the NFL Draft to give Lamar Jackson another weapon, just as they did in 2023 when they selected Zay Flowers with the 22nd overall pick. Tyson would prove to be a solid complement to Flowers and give Baltimore some long-term stability at the position group that Jackson can build up chemistry with. The Ravens need to maximize Jackson's window while he is still in his prime, and adding more weapons like Tyson around him could go a long way in finally breaking through to the Super Bowl. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh Steelers (No. 21)The Steelers have been on the hunt for a No. 2 wide receiver for the last few years. For a minute, it looked like they had their dynamic duo after trading for DK Metcalf last offseason. However, after that blockbuster, Pittsburgh traded George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys, creating the need for a second pass catcher all over again. In 2025, Metcalf led the team with 850 yards receiving. The next most productive wide receiver on the Steelers was Calvin Austin III, who finished with 372 yards receiving. Landing Tyson, who falls due to his injury history in this scenario, could be a major coup for Pittsburgh, which finally gets its one-two punch at receiver for Aaron Rodgers or whoever Mike McCarthy pegs as his quarterback for 2026. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Everyone's definition of the term \"sleeper\" is different, but I like to have a standard: Anyone taken outside of the top-200 in ADP. There are certainly players being drafted earlier who could fit the bill for a sleeper -- Geraldo Perdomo is going about 60 spots later on average than his 2025 finish, a sign that Fantasy drafters are at least figuratively asleep at the wheel coming off his breakout -- but I like to focus more on late-round targets for my list. It just helps to narrow things down.Unfortunately, prices change, which means players who once qualified for the list no longer do. The best example of that is Pirates uber prospect Konnor Griffin, who was being drafted 230.4 on average in NFBC drafts back in 2025 but has jumped up to 193.4 since the start of February. And after he hit a couple of loud homers Tuesday in spring action, I suspect that price is only going to keep climbing. He might end up a top-150 pick or higher if it looks like an Opening Day lineup spot is his, but either way, he no longer fits the bill of a sleeper. By my definition, at least.So Griffin is out. And I've made a few other changes from my Sleepers 1.0 column since it came out nearly a month and a half ago. In my Sleepers 2.0, I've noted the players who have dropped off the list (and why), but there are mostly holdovers from that initial version of the list. But I do want to highlight one new name: Andrew Painter. There was a point where it looked like Painter was going to make his MLB debut as a 19-year-old, and even though he missed the entirety of the 2023 and 2024 seasons, he'll still be just 22 on Opening Day. He has gone through a lot since then, including Tommy John surgery and a miserable 2025 season that saw him stall out at Triple-A despite entering the season with every expectation that he would end up in the rotation. The truth is, he just never earned it, putting up a 5.26 ERA in 118 innings.\nPainter's mechanics got a bit out of whack, leading to struggles with his entire arsenal. But his prospect ranking didn't really take too much of a hit, and given his age and pedigree, betting on him figuring it out still makes a lot of sense. Especially give his current 328.2 ADP in February drafts. If we see him get on the mound and dominate this spring, that price will surely rise, but I've also seen enough comments (both from Fantasy analysts and players) that suggest people have some fatigue around Painter, which could serve as a counterbalance.Either way, he's certainly cheap enough that all we care about is the possible upside, and it's entirely possible he remains cheap all spring. And, for whatever it's worth, Painter is garnering positive reviews in Phillies camp so far. I'll be buying him at that price every time. The rest of my updated sleeper picks are below, and I'm sticking with NFBC ADP in the month of February for my picks. Where players are removed from Sleepers 1.0, I've noted who was taken out, why, and who is replacing them -- and we've got a deep sleeper for every position for those of you looking even later in your drafts for gems: \nSleepers 2.0Carter Jensen, C, Royals -- ADP: 201.4What happened to Francisco Alvarez? I still love Alvarez's profile and the gains he made after coming back from Triple-A last summer. But he graduates from this list with his ADP rising to 170.2 in the month of February. He's still pretty much my ideal No. 2 catcher, but if I'm being consistent, I have to push him off Sleepers 2.0 (and likely onto Breakouts 2.0).  Jensen has the tools to be a superstar. We saw that in his brief cup of coffee late in the season, but it's not like it came out of nowhere -- he hit .290/.377/.501 in Double-A and Triple-A in 2024, and he put up an average exit velocity north of 94 mph in both Triple-A and the majors. I worry the batting average could drag behind because there will be some strikeout issues here, but a .250 batting average with 20-plus homers will certainly play at catcher, and that definitely isn't the ceiling here. Jensen could hit 30 homers while playing nearly every day (he'll likely DH plenty when Salvador Perez is behind the plate) if all comes together. Deep Sleeper: Harry Ford, Nationals: Ford's development has kind of stalled out, and the presence of Keibert Ruiz will limit his early opportunities. But he's more than held his own in the high minors and could provide some out-of-position speed if the bat plays. \nKyle Manzardo, 1B, Guardians -- ADP: 232.5What's new: The Guardians signed Rhys Hoskins, which presents a small amount of risk for Manzardo's everyday chances. On the other hand, I'm not sure the Guardians have enough talent to stick these guys in a platoon -- they might just have to use Hoskins every day at DH. I'm still bullish on Manzardo. Here's why: The question for any talented, young left-handed hitter is inevitably, \"Can they hit lefties?\" In Manzardo's case, it's hard to say, because he got just 95 plate appearances against them in 2025, but I think he's got a chance. His .287 wOBA doesn't back it up, but look under the hood, and there are reasons to be optimistic, as he had a .315 expected wOBA, 90 mph average exit velocity, and a viable 26% strikeout rate against southpaws. At the very least, he showed enough last season to be worth a longer look against them. And I'm not sure the Guardians really have much of a choice. The offseason isn't over, but there isn't an obvious platoon bat to split time with him. Late last season, they did at least show a willingness to give Manzardo a chance – after starting just one out of 27 games against lefties from late May through mid-August, he started seven of their final 10 against them, including their playoff game against Tarik Skubal. Manzardo hit 27 homers last season despite being much less than a full-time player, so it doesn't take much projection to get him to 30-plus with a bump in playing time. That's not bad for a post-200 pick. \nDeep Sleeper: Coby Mayo, Orioles: This is kind of the last chance for Mayo, and it's not at all clear he's good enough to handle major-league pitching. At the very least, he hasn't really shown much reason to be optimistic -- even his .941 OPS last September came with a 29% strikeout rate and 82.6 mph average exit velocity. But he has nothing left to prove at Triple-A, and with Jordan Westburg on the IL to open the season (at least), Mayo is going to play every day to open the season. I'll take a cheap flyer on that late pop. Marcus Semien, 2B, Mets -- ADP: 244.1What happened to Matt McLain? McLain's spot at second base seems secure with the Reds announcing that Sal Stewart will primarily play first base. McLain still has to hit, but I haven't given up on McLain. However, Semien is even cheaper, and I think he's probably just the better hitter. So we pivot to Semien!If you look at the top-line numbers, Semien is in free fall as he nears his late 30s. He hit just .230 with 15 homers last season, his first season with fewer than 23 since 2018. Under the surface, it's less obvious that Semien has totally fallen off. His xwOBA in 2025 was .318, right in line with what he did in 2024 and actually slightly ahead of his 2022 mark. His strikeout rate did climb to the highest rate since 2021, which is one red flag, and it's entirely possible that Semien's profile (which relies heavily on making a lot of contact and directing a lot of balls just over the left field fence) just doesn't leave him with a particularly large margin for error. It's also possible that he just underperformed for a couple of months in a park that increasingly looks like a poor fit for Semien's swing. Citi Field isn't a great hitter's park, but it rates out as a better hitter's park for right-handed hitters than Globe Life Field did. Add in the excellent Mets lineup ahead of him, and expecting a return to usefulness from Semien is pretty easy at this price. \nDeep Sleeper: Edouard Julien, Rockies: Julien has real skills. He's a very patient hitter with legitimate pop for a second baseman. But his flaws (an overly passive approach and an inability to hit the ball in the air to the right parts of the field held him back from living up to the potential so many once thought he had. Those flaws haven't disappeared, but Coors Field could help cover up for them. I could see a return to a .250 average and 20-ish homers on the Rockies. Kazuma Okamoto, 3B, Blue Jays -- ADP: 230.6What's new: Okamoto's price has risen, but not nearly fast enough. Maybe a big spring will do it, but for now, he's still coming off the board about a round after Munetaka Murakami. I like both as sleepers, but Okamoto is definitely the safer pick. Here's what I liked about him in Sleepers 1.0: Okamoto's price is starting to rise, but not especially quickly in drafts since his signing. That's fine, I'll take the discount. I think he's unlikely to be a superstar, but I do think his playing time should be pretty secure, and I think there's a pretty good chance Okamoto ends up eligible at first base and in the outfield in addition to third base – and I wouldn't be totally shocked if he saw some reps at second base in a pinch, too. He won't be the consistent 30-plus homer guy he was in Japan, but his strong contact skills and ability to hit the ball in the air to the pull side should make him a viable source of power. The comp I've been going with is the post-Coors Field version of Nolan Arenado, like when he hit .266 with 26 homers and 93 RBI in 2023 and was a top-75 hitter in Fantasy. Not a superstar, but a very solid starting option, especially for a CI spot. \nDeep Sleeper: Jordan Lawlar, Diamondbacks: The fact that the Diamondbacks have never really embraced Lawlar as an MLB player is a bit concerning, but there have been injuries and playing time roadblocks in his way as an extenuating circumstance. He's struggled with breaking balls, but otherwise hits the ball hard with decent plate discipline and at least above-average power and speed. He's a perfect high-upside bench piece to draft in all categories leagues if he looks set to play every day in the outfield for the Diamondbacks. JJ Wetherholt, SS, Cardinals -- ADP: 251.8What happened to Konnor Griffin? In Sleepers 1.0, I said, \"I suspect by the time Spring Training rolls around, Griffin is going to cost too much to qualify for a \"sleeper tag.\" He's just inside of the top 200 right now because of concerns about his role, but I'd bet Tuesday's two-homer game alone is worth a couple of rounds in ADP over the next week or so. So, we'll go a few spots down the prospect rankings for Wetherholt, whose role is much less in question. In fact, I would be outright shocked if he didn't open the 2026 season as the Cardinals second baseman at this point (and that's part of why he's such a good target, seeing as 2B is much shallower than SS for Fantasy). Wetherholt doesn't have the incredible tools Griffin does -- his max exit velocity was just 108 mph last season, a below-average mark. What he does have is a very solid skill set, where he hits the ball hard pretty regularly -- his average exit velocity at Triple-A was 90.8 mph, an 84th percentile mark, for example -- and makes a lot of contact. And he's a good athlete who should chip in at least 15 steals, with the potential for more. The Cardinals are in a rebuilding phase, but I don't think their offense is going to be a disaster, and Wetherholt has a chance to hit pretty high up if he gets off to a good start. Coming off a 17-23 season in just 109 games, with a clear path to playing time, getting Wetherholt outside of the top-200 feels like stealing. \nDeep Sleeper: Colt Emerson, Mariners: Emerson is another prospect whose profile figures to rise this spring, as the Mariners are expected to give him a chance to win the second base job. Playing much of last season as a 19-year-old himself, Emerson hit .285/.383/.458 with 16 homers and 14 steals in 130 games and could grow into more power. Justin Crawford, OF, Phillies -- ADP: 278.3What's new: The Phillies haven't officially named Crawford their starting center fielder, but I don't really know who else it's supposed to be if not him. He's not an ideal fit there, but he's the best choice the Phillies have, and nothing out of camp suggests there's much risk of him starting in the minors. Here's what I like about Crawford:Crawford is a controversial player in real-life prospect rankings. Scouting reports tend to focus on what Crawford doesn't do: Despite plus-plus foot speed, Crawford doesn't project as an MLB-caliber centerfielder; despite at least above-average raw power, he doesn't project to hit for power in the majors because he swings at way too many pitches out of the zone and rarely elevates the ball. Those limitations put a real cap on how high the ceiling can be at the big-league level, and they are very fair concerns to bring up when discussing his real-life value.\nBut I don't know how much we should care about them for Fantasy. Despite poor swing decisions, Crawford still makes a lot of contact and still racks up very strong batting averages because of his ability to hit hard grounders and beat out throws with his plus-plus speed. You'd prefer there was a likelier path to double-digit homers, but this isn't necessarily a Chandler Simpson profile – Crawford will occasionally run into one, hitting 10 homers in 152 games between Double-A and Triple-A. He'll have every chance to emerge as an everyday player for the Phillies and could at least be a plus contributor in batting average and steals, with the potential for a bunch of steals if he can force his way into the mix near the top of the lineup. If I'm looking for a steals specialist, I think I'd rather bet on Crawford than Simpson 100 picks earlier. Chase DeLauter, OF, Guardians -- ADP: 317.3What's new: Nothing, really. DeLauter seems all but certain to open the season as the Guardians starting right fielder, and while there's a lot of injury risk here (that could lead to some load management days off), there's plenty of upside if the bat clicks. For as much time as he has missed over the years, prospect folks still universally seem to love DeLauter's swing:DeLauter's prospect standing has taken a hit since he was the 16th pick back in the 2022 draft, but it's not because of his performance. When DeLauter has been on the field, he has been very productive, hitting .302/.384/.504 in 138 games. Prior to 2025, the issue had been recurring foot injuries, but he was felled by sports hernia surgery and a broken hamate bone as he was on the cusp of making it to the majors last season. \nThe Guardians will almost certainly play it safe with DeLauter's playing time at least early on in 2026, and it's up to him to force the issue by staying healthy and emerging as the force in the middle of the lineup they've expected him to be for years. The smart money shouldn't be on DeLauter staying healthy, but when you're talking about a late-draft dart throw, you're never talking about high-probability bets. At least this one is on a guy who might still be a premium talent (he posted above-average quality of contact metrics with very good plate discipline in his brief time at Triple-A last season) who should have a job as long as he's healthy. Daylen Lile, OF, Nationals -- ADP: 208.4What happened to Anthony Santander? The shoulder injury that wrecked his 2025 season never went away, and Santander had surgery to repair a torn labrum at the start of Spring Training. He'll likely be out until the second half of the season and shouldn't be drafted in most leagues. Lile kind of came out of nowhere. He didn't rank as even a top-20 prospect in the Nationals' system according to BaseballProspectus.com entering 2025. But, while Lile has the feel of a late-career flash in the pan, he was just 22 years old all of last season as he took a huge step forward. He hit .328/.377/.503 across 47 games between Double-A and Triple-A (after just a .735 OPS in 2024, by comparison), and then he came up to the majors and hit .299/.347/.498 in 91 games. I don't necessarily think he's just a .300 hitter moving forward, but the contact skills here are real, and it's non-zero power -- a 35th percentile hard-hit rate and 33rd percentile average exit velocity can work with his bat control. The profile would look a lot better if Lile could turn his 92nd percentile sprint speed into something more like 30-steal potential, but we could be looking at a very cheap 15-homer, 20-steal guy who might be a true standout in batting average, as his .302 expected BA showed in 2025. Deep Sleeper: Carson Benge, Mets: The comp we've been throwing around for Benge is Brandon Nimmo, and as long as he doesn't totally flop this spring, we have every reason to believe he'll be in the Mets' starting lineup. There isn't a ton of present power, but some swing optimization could unlock 20-plus homers without sacrificing batting average. I don't think the market has quite caught up with the likelihood of Benge being on the Opening Day roster. Kris Bubic, SP, Royals -- ADP: 219.3What's new: There was some talk about the Royals possibly trading Bubic this offseason, but that never came to fruition. We haven't seen him on the mound yet this spring, but all indications are he's going to be in the team's rotation, so let's hope he gets into a game soon and shows no ill effects from last year's shoulder injury. Here's what I like about him: That Bubic is coming back from a rotator cuff strain that ended his breakout season early is likely what is keeping his price down, and that's a pretty big red flag … if he costs much at all to draft. However, with his price sitting outside of the top 200, much of the downside risk here is mitigated, and what we're left with is a pitcher who showed legitimate front-of-rotation upside last season.Bubic threw 116.1 innings with a 2.55 ERA, and while the peripherals don't quite back it up, they don't suggest it was some fluke either – you'd still take his 3.16 expected ERA, wouldn't you? Bubic missed plenty of bats with his four-seamer last season, and when he didn't, hitters still struggled to do damage against it, putting up a lowly .287 expected wOBA as they often just got under the ball with the barrel. An excellent changeup surely helped in that regard, and overall, as does an overall five-pitch mix without an obvious weak spot. Bubic isn't an ace when healthy, but he should be a must-start pitcher who isn't being drafted that way. Even accounting for the injury risk, I think he's one of the very best values in drafts right now. Joe Musgrove, SP, Padres -- ADP: 226.6What's new: It's no news so far, and I'd say that counts as good news. Musgrove is working his way back from Tommy John surgery, but he's been fully cleared for Spring Training and should get on a mound here soon. Here's why I'm in on Musgrove's comeback chance:If last season taught us anything, it's that we should be very cautious with pitchers coming back from Tommy John surgery. That obviously applies to Musgrove, who had the procedure back in October of 2024, though that timeline also makes it very likely he'll be good to go from the start of Spring Training. Will he be, you know, good? It's fair to be skeptical, and the market is, with his ADP sitting around 250 – compare that to Shane McClanahan and Sandy Alcantara this time last year, who were being drafted around 150 coming back from their own Tommy John surgeries. Musgrove dealt with injuries in 2023 and 2024 that limited him to under 100 innings in each season, but he has been very effective when on the mound, putting up a 3.20 ERA and 1.11 WHIP from 2021 to 2024. Getting a 100-pick discount on Musgrove compared to Alcantara and McClanahan this time last year. Parker Messick, SP, Guardians -- ADP: 316What's new: Messick is one of four pitchers fighting for three spots in the Guardians rotation, and I think most are assuming he won't be in at this point. There are reasons for that (he has options and some of the other contenders don't), but if the Guardians want to put their best five starters out there, Messick will be among them. And it'll only take one injury to someone ahead of him to guarantee a spot. Here's why I'm drafting him despite the uncertainty: For all the hype around this crop of exciting pitchers who debuted in the second half of 2026, it seems like everyone is just forgetting about Messick. Messick doesn't have even average velocity on his fastball, but the pitch has always punched above its weight, including with a 29% whiff rate last season, thanks to a low release point, excellent command, and the way it plays off his terrific changeup. Messick has never garnered a ton of hype as a prospect, but he has been very effective in the upper minors, routinely running 30% strikeout rates, which is one reason to think there might be some juice left to squeeze out of his average K rate from last season. There appears to be some concern in the Fantasy community that he may not have a rotation spot, but I really can't see the Guardians overlooking what he did down the stretch, so they can stick proven mediocrities like Slade Cecconi and Logan Allen in the rotation instead. Messick's gonna be in there unless something goes really wrong. Grayson Rodriguez, SP, Angels -- ADP: 296.6What happened to Jonah Tong? It just looks like Tong is a real long shot to make the Mets rotation -- even in a six-man configuration, he might need multiple injuries to have a spot. I still like Tong in the long run, but he's made just two starts above Double-A, so heading back to Triple-A for some seasoning isn't the end of the world. We'll see him before the All-Star break unless something goes really wrong. Coming off an entirely lost season due to another lat injury and then surgery to remove bone spurs from his elbow, Rodriguez entered Spring Training as one of the true unknowns in baseball. And, as of publication, he's still a big question mark. But we did get our first semblance of some answers when he made his spring debut, and while the results (1 ER on 1 H, 3 BB, 2 K in 1.2 IP) weren't great, the results really weren't what anyone cared about. What we cared about was seeing a glimpse of what Rodriguez looks like after all of the injuries, and for the most part, I thought it was pretty promising! Rodriguez sat at 96.1 mph with his four-seamer, right in line with where he was in 2024. It was down a bit from 2023, but seeing as it was his first start in over a year, it's not unreasonable to think there might be room to grow from there. That fastball has always been an effective pitch for Rodriguez, and his changeup has been too. It looks like Rodriguez was back to using his sweeper, which was an excellent pitch in 2023 before he ditched it for a harder slider, so that's nice to see. Rodriguez has a long way to go before we can view him as a trustworthy start, and I think smart money is probably betting against it. But if he keeps showing his pre-injury skills, Rodriguez will be hard to ignore in the later rounds. Deep Sleeper: Robby Snelling, Marlins: Snelling's price was supposed to rise after the Edward Cabrera and Ryan Weathers trades, and has profiled for a while as another one of these \"command-over-stuff\" lefties who have had so much success in recent years. Except he can also dial his fastball up to the 96-97 range. He was dominant in the minors in 2025, putting up a 2.51 ERA in 136 innings, including a microscopic 1.27 mark in Triple-A. He deserves to be on your reserve round radar in leagues of any size. Bryan Abreu, RP, Astros -- ADP: 211.5What happened to Edwin Uceta? Uceta is dealing with a shoulder injury this spring, and while he hasn't been ruled out for Opening Day, it just doesn't make much sense to pin my hopes to a pitcher who is already hurt. I'll pin my hopes to a pitcher backing up someone who is already hurt, instead. Josh Hader's status for Opening Day is in doubt with a biceps injury, which is pretty scary after his 2025 season ended early with a shoulder injury. It might be totally unrelated, but it's never a good sign when a pitcher gets to spring training and almost immediately starts dealing with an injury. The Astros are downplaying the injury, and it very well may mean nothing, but I do think Abreu has to be on your radar in basically all leagues now. He's a good enough reliever to matter in categories leagues even as a setup man (three straight seasons of 100 strikeouts is pretty impressive), and if he gets to close for any stretch of time, he's immediately a top-10 option at the position. In all likelihood, Hader doesn't miss enough time for that to matter for Abreu, but there are some tail-end outcomes where Abreu finishes as a top-five reliever in Fantasy if Hader's injuries get worse. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL is in a bit of a holding pattern. Following an epic playoff run that culminated in Super Bowl LX, we essentially drove off a cliff, with the action coming to a screeching halt once we left Santa Clara, Calif. Sure, we have the NFL Scouting Combine to momentarily satisfy our palates, but the league is largely twiddling its thumbs and staring at the clock until we get to early March. Beginning on March 9, the legal tampering window opens, followed by March 11 when the new league year begins, and free agents can officially ink new deals. While this period is largely focused on free agents and where those players end up, the start of the new league year is also when trades can become official. The parameters of those deals, however, can be struck at any point, meaning that some big names could be on the move at any moment. Below, we'll highlight a handful of notable NFL stars that could be thrust into trade talks in the coming weeks. \nIt feels like Tua Tagovailoa's time with the Miami Dolphins is up one way or another. The former first-round quarterback was benched toward the end of the regular season, and the firing of head coach Mike McDaniel all but ensures that the two sides will part ways. After all, new head coach Jeff Hafley and GM John-Eric Sullivan have no ties to Tagovailoa whatsoever, and have already begun stripping the roster down to the studs to rebuild it in their own image. Tagovailoa himself even admitted that a fresh start somewhere else would be welcome. \nThe question is how this divorce actually unfolds. If the Dolphins outright release Tagovailoa (with a post-June 1 designation), he'd account for $67.4 million in dead cap charges for 2026 and $31.8 million in 2027. That would be a historically costly avenue to go down, so it would seem like the preferred path for Miami would be to find a trade partner for Tagovailoa, while eating a large chunk of his contract. In that scenario, they'd still owe a sizable amount of his the $212.4 million extension he signed before the 2024 season, but they'd at least get some relief and a small asset or two coming back to them. \nSimilar to Tagovailoa above, Kyler Murray's tenure with the Cardinals has run dry. The franchise is undergoing a reset after firing Jonathan Gannon and hiring Mike LaFleur, and a split from Murray could be next on the offseason to-do list. This comes after Murray was effectively benched for Jacoby Brissett midway through the season, along with missing time due to a foot injury. Murray is due $42.5 million in 2026, and Arizona will likely be required to take on some of that money in order to facilitate a deal. Entering his age-29 season, Murray does have some trade value given the lack of talent at the position at the 2026 NFL Draft. \nMaxx Crosby may be the biggest name to move this offseason after his relationship with the Las Vegas Raiders fractured at the tail end of the 2025 season. To his chagrin, the franchise shut the star pass rusher down despite his desire to play out the string. That decision may prove to be the catalyst that sends him out of Las Vegas. From the Raiders perspective, moving on from Crosby could make sense even if he has been the fabric of the organization since he was drafted in 2019. The club possesses the first overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft and will likely use that selection to bring in Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza to pair with first-year head coach Klint Kubiak. Given what star pass rushers are going for on the trade market and Crosby not fitting in with the Raiders new timeline, they could look to sell high on the 28-year-old.  \nA.J. Brown is no stranger to having his name in trade rumors. His souring relationship with the Philadelphia Eagles over the last couple of seasons has only poured fuel onto these flames, which could come to a head this offseason. It feels as if this could be the moment the Eagles move on from Brown, particularly after a lackluster playoff showing during Wild Card Weekend against the San Francisco 49ers that also featured a sideline spat with head coach Nick Sirianni. Brown is on the back end of his prime as he's set to enter his age-29 season, but is still a productive receiver capable of being a true No. 1 option when he's firing on all cylinders, so there will be a market for him. However, Philadelphia shouldn't expect to receive a first-round pick in return like they spent to acquire him from the Tennessee Titans in 2022. The 2026 season is the final year that Brown has any guaranteed money ($29 million) on his contract, so any team looking to trade for him would likely also need to revise his deal, shrinking the asking price. Given the lack of impact free agent wide receivers, Brown could be one of the most impactful offensive skill position players to move this offseason.   \nThe San Francisco 49ers are reportedly reluctant to trade Mac Jones this offseason, but I wonder if they are just playing hard to get. After all, the club has Brock Purdy locked in as their franchise cornerstone at quarterback after inking him to a five-year, $265 million extension last May. That makes Jones merely a high-quality backup, and there's a case to be made that he holds more value to the franchise as a trade asset than Purdy insurance. That's especially true given how well Jones played filling in for Purdy last season, owning a 5-3 record over his eight games as the starter while completing 69.6% of his passes for 2,151 yards, 13 touchdowns, six interceptions, and a 97.4 passer rating. Given that the NFL has seen several castoff quarterbacks revive their careers in recent seasons, Jones could be earmarked as the next QB up in that movement. The former first-rounder has also expressed his desire to be a starter again. A team with a hole at quarterback could look to Jones, who is under contract for just $2.81 million in base salary next season, as an option with the hopes that he follows in the footsteps of Daniel Jones and Sam Darnold to enjoy a career renaissance. \nThe Dolphins have started to tear the roster down, moving on from former pillars like Tyreek Hill and Bradley Chubb. This comes after the team hired a completely new regime in head coach Jeff Hafley and GM Jon-Eric Sullivan, who are now looking to build Miami from the ground up. This will be a multi-year rebuild for the Dolphins, and while moving on from Tagovailoa may be the most likely transaction to come down, we also can't rule out other names departing like Jaylen Waddle. The 27-year-old receiver has been stellar when he's been healthy throughout his career and could command serious trade value if Miami were to put him on the block. \nFrom the Dolphins standpoint, Waddle will likely be looking for a revamped contract after this season. Despite currently being signed throughout the 2028 season, the guarantees in Waddle's contract run out after 2026 ($16.6 million). Instead of locking heads in a contract dispute, the Dolphins could continue purging the roster and trade Waddle, who other teams in a win-now window would look at as a highly skilled receiver who they'd be more than happy to bring aboard and adjust his deal. \nThe Jaguars are probably not going to shop Brian Thomas Jr., but I wonder if they stay on the line if prospective trade partners call up with offers instead of immediately hanging up the phone. Thomas lit the NFL on fire during his rookie season, catching 87 balls for 1,282 yards and 10 touchdowns. However, his sophomore campaign was much more muted, with 707 yards receiving. That uninspiring second season was the first under head coach Liam Coen and GM James Gladstone, neither of whom was with the team when Thomas was drafted. Jacksonville also has a bit of an overflow at receiver. Of course, they have Travis Hunter, whom they moved up to the No. 2 overall pick to make a combo receiver/corner. The Jaguars also traded for Jakobi Meyers midseason and inked him to a three-year, $80 million extension. Third-receiver Parker Washington also broke out in 2025 with a team-leading 847 yards receiving. Does all that make Thomas expendable if a team comes to them with a Godfather offer? A year ago, he would've been untouchable. Now, it could be a different story at the right (and high) price. \n            ",

American striker Folarin Balogun will be central to that after netting a brace in the first leg, helping Monaco play to their current one-goal deficit. How to watch Paris Saint-Germain vs. Monaco, oddsDate: Wednesday, Feb. 25 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Parc des Princes -- Paris, FranceLive stream: Paramount+Odds: PSG -400; Draw +550; Monaco +850Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

It has been a strange season with Balogun underperforming his expected goals despite his performances in these moments, but he's only 24 and not yet in his prime. With the 2026 World Cup drawing closer by the day, where Balogun is expected to lead the line for the United States men's national team, it's only a good thing for both Monaco and USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino to see Balogun performing at this level in the biggest matches. There will only be more pressure on him as the year goes on, but he's rising to the occasion.\nGreat at turning good chances into shooting opportunities, Balogun will be able to take advantage of PSG's injury issues to make things happen in the match.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Luis Enrique's Parisians will be without Ousmane Dembele and Fabian Ruiz, who are critical members of the side. Dembele has been in and out of the XI this season after securing the Ballon d'Or, and that is a large reason why PSG aren't leading Ligue 1 like they'd expect to at this stage. After winning the Champions League for the first time in their history last campaign, PSG are among the top contenders to do so again, but overcoming injuries to key players after a long season that saw them make the Club World Cup final isn't an easy task. \nFacing another Ligue 1 side, PSG have additional familiarity, similar to when they faced Brest in the knockouts last year, but it also means that Monaco know what to expect. Only time will tell if returning home will give PSG an advantage in the match, but if they give Monaco an inch, Balogun will score, and an early goal could change everything in the clash between these two sides.\n            ",

Three of the teams that Houston defeated during its win streak are current AFC playoff squads in Jacksonville, Buffalo and Indianapolis. Meanwhile, the single best unit on the field come Sunday, and arguably in all of the NFL, is Houston's defense. It has allowed both the fewest points and fewest yards, and the Texans are the only NFL team which hasn't allowed more touchdown passes than it has defensive interceptions. Just five teams have more sacks than Houston (34), and it gets to face a Chiefs squad that's allowed three-plus sacks in five straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Chiefs can coverOne can't ignore Kansas City's five straight wins over Houston, with the four of those at home all coming by at least eight points. This year's Chiefs have balance, as one of six teams to rank in the top 10 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, while Houston has the No. 21 scoring offense. Kansas City is also extremely efficient, as it's committed the second-fewest turnovers, and Patrick Mahomes is having one of his finest seasons. He ranks second in the league in QBR, third in passing yards and fifth in passing touchdowns. Mahomes has also carved up the Texans like no other over his career as across six games versus Houston, the two-time MVP owns a 15:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio. See which team to back at SportsLine.Missouri sports betting is now live.

    "body": "\n        Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday was almost more notable for what didn't happen than the chaos on the pitch. Benched for the third consecutive match, club legend Mohamed Salah went as an unused sub for the second time in the last three matches. Salah has now failed to register a goal contribution in seven consecutive matches in all competitions, and he only has five goals and three assists all season, while Liverpool have slipped, not just out of the title race, but out of the European places altogether.It's been a trying season for the Reds, and following the draw, Salah has opened the door to whether this could be the end of his time at Liverpool. While Salah has been a critical part of Liverpool's attack, scoring 29 goals and assisting 18 more en route to winning the title last season, being on the bench these past few games is getting to him, and the Egyptian sounded off following the loss to Leeds.\"It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,\" Salah said. While Salah didn't specify who is trying to get him out of the club, he did admit that his relationship with manager Arne Slot has deteriorated this season. \n\"I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship,\" Salah said. \"I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.\"Salah leaves for the Africa Cup of Nations to represent Egypt on Dec. 15, and if they advance to the final, he wouldn't return to Liverpool until after Jan. 18 of 2026, when the winter transfer window will be open. Despite just signing a contract extension with Liverpool at the end of last season, this could be the end of Salah at Anfield. He still has two games before AFCON, an away trip to Inter in the Champions League on Tuesday, followed by a home clash with Brighton on Dec. 13Comments like the ones made Saturday are tough ones to come back from, and they didn't end there for Salah. \n\"I said to [my family], come to the Brighton game. I don't know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it. In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now,\" Salah said. \"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup. I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.\"With previous interest from the Saudi Pro League, if Liverpool were to decide that it's time to move on, they could likely find a suitor to take the Egyptian. Even at 33, Salah has more to give, but Father Time is catching up to him in the Premier League, so a January move could benefit all parties.\"In football, you never know. I don't accept this situation. I have done so much for this club,\" Salah said when asked if this would be his last game for the club.\nIt seems like Salah is willing to fight for his place at Liverpool, but it has created quite a situation for Slot and the club. Playing Salah after this almost makes it seem like Slot is caving to him, but then not selecting Salah would deepen the spiral that is happening. When Slot took over for Jurgen Klopp ahead of last season, he was expected to face adversity, but with the Reds riding a smooth journey to the title, he avoided the worst of it.That all seems to be coming to a head this season, as with Liverpool not winning, cracks in the foundation of the club are there as they struggle to integrate Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak. Previously, this was Salah's team, and with the additions and decisions made, it has morphed into Slot's team. That'd be one thing if Liverpool were keeping pace with the title contenders, but if it comes down to Salah versus Slot in a power struggle, it's unclear what direction the front office would lean. Liverpool have rarely been a team to dismiss a manager in the middle of a season, especially when someone has built up as much goodwill as Slot did in his first year in charge, but something also will need to give here between the duo if the situation is fixed. If it doesn't get fixed, Liverpool's issues from this season will grow and they could find themselves looking at quite a long rebuild down the road.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the end, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee took the path of least resistance, bringing head-to-head into the conversation for the first time this season in their final placement of Miami over Notre Dame for the last at-large spot in Sunday's 12-team bracket.Ninth-ranked Alabama did not move despite a 21-point loss to Georiga in the SEC Championship Game, centering the discussion on the Hurricanes and Fighting Irish for the last spot. Miami entered the final rankings at No. 12, while Notre Dame was No. 10.Both teams were idle during conference championship weekend.\"We felt like the way BYU performed in their championship game, a second loss to Texas Tech in a similar fashion, was worthy of Miami moving ahead of them in the rankings,\" committee chair Hunter Yurachek said Sunday. \"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side-by-side comparison. … The one metric we had to fall back on was the head to head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"Yurachek said Duke's win over Virginia and the idea of the ACC being excluded from the bracket entirely \"had absolutely no impact\" on the decision to include Miami at No. 10.\n\"Our charge is to rank the top 25 teams, then you fill out the 5 highest-ranked conference champions and seven at-large spots for the bracket,\" Yurachek said.Miami ended the season on a four-game winning streak with a margin of victory at 27.5 points per game. The Cougars, after losing to Texas Tech on Nov. 1, had won three straight at a 21 points per game clip prior to Saturday's 34-7 beatdown at the hands of the Red Raiders. The metrics were extremely tight when it comes to Miami's case against Notre Dame (10-2) and BYU (11-2) on paper. Game control was this committee's preferred metric as we've seen the last four weeks of rankings and ranked wins are supposed to mean something -- and they did during final deliberations.\nIn terms of common opponents as it relates to Notre Dame specifically, Miami beat NC State 41-7, Syracuse 38-10, Stanford 42-7 and Pittsburgh 38-7. And the Hurricanes beat three of the four common opponents shared with Notre Dame by an even wider margin.Following Tuesday night's penultimate rankings, Yurachek left the door open for the Hurricanes. A loss for BYU placed Miami right behind Notre Dame for the first time during this playoff discussion and was the final data point needed for the boost.\"The management committee during the offseason provided some clarification to some comments that were made last year, and indeed idle teams can move following the results of the championship games,\" Yurachek said earlier this week. \"And how they impact the teams that are around those that play in the championship game and data such as strength of schedule, teams that may be idle. So yes, teams that are idle can move up or down.\"\nMiami will travel to seventh-seeded Texas A&M in the opening round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mike Tomlin wasn't asked about all of the outside noise following the Steelers' 27-22 win over the Ravens that propelled Pittsburgh into first place in the AFC North. But Aaron Rodgers was, and the veteran quarterback didn't mince works while addressing the recent speculation regarding his coach. \"Means maybe you guys will shut the hell up for a week,\" Rodgers said. Rodgers played a big role in Pittsburgh's win that should quiet some of the noise surrounding his coach, at least for now. He threw for 284 yards that included the game-winning, 38-yard score to running back Jaylen Warren. Rodgers, who turned 42 last week, also ran for his first touchdown since joining the Steelers. \nOn Sunday, the Steelers showed a resolve that has become synonymous with Tomlin's teams over the years. Despite its recent losses, the growing outside noise and facing a team that ran roughshod over them their their previous two meetings, the Steelers made enough plays on both sides of the ball to get a much-needed win that put them back into first place in the AFC North with four weeks to go. \n\"Awesome team win,\" Tomlin said afterward. \"I'm just appreciative of the effort of the men in that locker room. ... Big win for us, obviously, in a hostile environment, and we'll keep moving.\"Tomlin has received criticism for not having more success in the playoffs during his first 18 years as the Steelers' coach. A hallmark of Tomlin's tenure has been his ability to field competitive teams year in and year out -- regardless of the circumstances -- while never having a losing season. Pittsburgh's resolve undoubtedly played a role in Sunday's win, which has now put the 7-6 Steelers back in the driver's seat in terms of winning the North and the subsequent playoff spot that comes with it. Of the Steelers' final four opponents, only the Lions (whom they will face in Week 16) have a winning record. \nWhile Tomlin surely still has his detractors, the noise regarding him and his future with the Steelers should be dialed back this week as Pittsburgh readies itself for a prime time matchup against the suddenly-surging Dolphins. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Hideki Matsuyama has victoriously bookended 2025, following a season-opening win with another triumph in the Hero World Challenge, the last event of the campaign. Making his first appearance at the tournament in seven years, Matsuyama reigned victorious over Alex Noren in a playoff with a birdie on the first extra hole clinching his victory.Matsuyama utilised a final-round 64 to post a 22-under total for the tournament. He matched when Noren rolled in a birdie putt from just outside 18 feet on the 72nd hole. The two were featured in the penultimate group, yet they were able to skirt past 54-hole leader Sepp Straka, who finished the week at 21 under, and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler -- the two-time defending champion at this event -- who finished at 20 under alongside J.J. Spaun in a tie for fourth.First played in 2000, the Hero World Challenge now has six multiple-time winners. Matsuyama joins the list that includes Davis Love III, tournament host Tiger Woods, Graeme McDowell, Viktor Hovland and Scheffler. In the last nine playings of the event, Matsuyama, Scheffler and Hovland have combined for six victories.Despite not having eyes on the leader at the onset of the day, Matsuyama made his move early and often from three strokes behind. The man from Japan rattled home three birdies in a four-hole stretch from Nos. 3-6, taking advantage of the two early par 5s at Albany Golf Club.\nStraka did well to match the pace of his hottest pursuer as the Austrian reached 20 under for the tournament thanks to three birdies in his first six holes. He grabbed another birdie at the turn to post a front-nine 32 before making his way to the inward half of the golf course, where Matsuyama was already making an impression.From 116 yards on the left side of the fairway of the par-4 10th, Matsuyama manoeuvred a wedge just long and right of the pin, where it then took a couple of bounces and spun back into the hole. From two behind into a share of the lead, Matsuyama never looked back as he began to build on his advantage.\nA birdie on the long par-4 13th gave Matsuyama a two-stroke lead as it started to appear he would cruise into the winner's circle. However, just as the tournament began to look in hand, Matsuyama saw Noren appear quickly in his rearview mirror. \nWinning twice on the DP World Tour this fall, including the league's flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship, the Swede made his push late. As Matsuyama continued to pile up pars -- he made par on his final five holes -- Noren started to string birdies together.He found the surface in two on the par-5 15th to make a stress-free birdie before knocking in a 19-foot effort on the difficult par-4 16th to give himself a heartbeat. Both Noren and Matsuyama narrowly missed chances on the par-3 17th, setting the stage for the finisher where Noren ultimately came through with one last circle on his scorecard to force a playoff.\"I aimed left edge,\" Noren said. \"It was quite nice, clear putt, actually. Some other putts, you don't know exactly what it's doing, but this one we were pretty clear on it.\"\nBack to the tee box, the two went as neither Straka nor Scheffler was able to join the fun. Scheffler made a heroic par save on the par-4 16th to stay within two strokes of the lead, but once he missed a 14-foot birdie opportunity on No. 17, his chances were all but dashed. Straka, on the other hand, made birdie on his final hole to eke closer to the final winning score but was upended by a poor bogey on the par-4 16th just two holes prior.That meant the date was set for only two, and after both players found the short grass with a fairway metal, an approach contest materialised with Matusyama ultimately getting the better of Noren. Striking his second, twirling his club and barking at his ball to sit, Matsuyama stuffed his iron shot to near tap-in distance to give himself his second win of the year and his second win at Tiger's tournament.\n            ",

It was Daniels' first game back from dislocating that same left elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. After throwing an interception to Minnesota edge defender Andrew Van Ginkel, Daniels was trying to chase down Van Ginkel when Isaiah Rodgers (legally) came in and shoved Daniels to the ground.\nDaniels was in clear pain leaving the field, and Marcus Mariota came in on the ensuing drive; Mariota's first drive also ended in an interception. Daniels entered the medical tent and emerged with a towel over his head and without the arm sleeve he had been wearing over his elbow. Washington ruled him questionable to return.Daniels suffered a plethora of injuries this season. He sprained his knee in a Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed the next two games. He came back and helped lead the Commanders to a Week 5 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, but Washington lost in Week 6 to the Chicago Bears, and in Week 7, Daniels suffered a hamstring strain in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He missed one game before returning in Week 9, when he suffered the dislocated elbow.Despite entering Week 14 with a 3-9 record, Washington wanted Daniels to return when medically cleared to help him gain reps and build toward next season. Daniels had nearly a week and a half of limited practices before being a full participant Thursday and Friday ahead of the Vikings game.\n\"I think it's important as Jayden's ... learning to play this position at the highest level competitively, also doing it safely, and those are reps, you know, that you develop as well,\" Quinn said on Nov. 24. \"It's a skill, just like throwing and processing. And so, all those things are important.\"\n            \n    ",

Despite the loss, however, the Buckeyes did not fall very far from the top spot they previously held, as Ryan Day's team came in at No. 2.

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff selection committee was never going to please everyone with its 2025 bracket. The decision to hold Notre Dame out of the 12-team field was a move that left the Fighting Irish and much of the college football world stunned. Athletic director Pete Bevacqua said Notre Dame feels as though a playoff berth was \"stolen\" from its players after its controversial slide behind Miami in the final top 25 rankings.Hours after learning it would not be included in the 12-team CFP bracket, Notre Dame announced it will not participate in bowl season.\"As a team, we've decided to withdraw our name from consideration for a bowl game following the 2025 season,\" Notre Dame wrote in a statement. \"We appreciate all the support from our families and fans, and we're hoping to bring the 12th national title to South Bend in 2026.\" The Fighting Irish entered conference championship week on the right side of the projected cut line and two spots ahead of the Hurricanes in the rankings. Neither team played a game this week, yet the committee felt it had enough evidence from the season-long results to swap them and put Miami in the field as the No. 10 seed.\n\"There is no explanation that could possibly be given to explain the outcome,\" Bevacqua said to Yahoo Sports. \"As I said to Marcus (Freeman), one thing is for sure: Any rankings or show prior to this last one is an absolute joke and a waste of time. Why put these young student-athletes through these false emotions just to pull the rug out from underneath them having not played a game in two weeks and then a group of people in a room shatter their dreams without explanation? We feel like the playoff was stolen from our student-athletes.\"This marks the second time in as many weeks that Notre Dame dropped in the rankings in favor of another CFP contender. Alabama leaped over the Fighting Irish at the end of the regular season despite winning by a smaller margin over Auburn than Notre Dame did over Stanford. Marcus Freeman's team won 10 games in a row but fell out of favor with the committee down the stretch, leading to one of the most questionable snubs of the playoff era.\"My feelings and the feelings here are just shock and, really, an absolute sense of sadness for our student-athletes,\" Bevacqua said. \"Overwhelming shock and sadness. Like a collective feeling that we were all just punched in the stomach.\"\nMiami's head-to-head win over Notre Dame in Week 1 proved decisive in determining which of the two bubble teams earned the final at-large playoff berth. The question facing the committee is why it took until Dec. 7 for that result to matter. The Fighting Irish ranked ahead of the Hurricanes in every set of CFP rankings before Sunday.The committee's explanation was that the head-to-head comparison only came into effect once the two teams were separated by one spot.\"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side-by-side comparison,\" committee chair Hunter Yurachek said. \"The one metric we had to fall back on was the head-to-head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"\n            ",

Coaching changes late in the season undoubtedly played a role in the Cyclones' and Wildcats' decisions, but while the Big 12 acknowledged the \"difficult timing\" of those staff turnovers, it announced it will levy $500,000 fines to both programs for opting out of the conference's bowl pool.The Big 12 cited its responsibility to fulfill contractual obligations with its bowl partners as reasoning for the fines. The conference considers the matter resolved and will have no further comment.It has become more common in recent years for players to opt out of bowl games and instead begin their preparations for the NFL Draft or seek opportunities elsewhere through the transfer portal. It is far less standard for entire programs to decline postseason bids, but Iowa State and Kansas State are not the first to do so. Marshall opted out of the Independence Bowl last season after it lost tens of players to the transfer portal. It received a fine from the Sun Belt for doing so.The two openings pave the way for teams with losing records to squeak into bowl berths. When such opportunities arise, five-win teams with the highest APR ratings get priority in filling the vacancies. Rice projects to secure one of the spots, and according to CBS Sports' Brad Crawford, UCF is expected to land the other berth. Auburn has a higher APR rating than UCF, but the Tigers are not expected to pursue a bowl berth amid its own coaching turnover.\nIowa State found itself in an unfavorable situation this week after Matt Campbell departed to take the Penn State job. The Cyclones were tasked with replacing the most accomplished coach in program history and did so in short order when they tabbed Washington State's Jimmy Rogers as their next leader.Kansas State also made a change this week when Chris Klieman announced his retirement. The Wildcats turned to one of their own in filling the job, hiring program legend Collin Klein away from his position as offensive coordinator at Texas A&M.\nWith neither Iowa State nor Kansas State set to participate in the postseason, Rogers and Klein can begin preparations for their debut seasons as Big 12 head coaches. Among their first tasks will be to retain key players and scour available talent in the transfer portal when it opens Jan. 2.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The College Football Playoff Selection Committee this weekend had the unenviable task of deciding which team to exclude among three worthy options --Alabama, Miami and Notre Dame. All had favorable at-large cases, but one had to be squeezed out and this is where we stand with the the Crimson Tide and Hurricanes being the final two selections.The adage \"when you try to please everyone you will please no one\" rings true here. The fable of the old man, the boy and the donkey illustrates this point. A father and son are walking through town with a donkey and are immediately criticized for not using the animal as a ride. After the father lifts his son on the donkey, the child is scolded by onlookers for making his elderly parent walk.Tired of being scoffed at, the pair tied the donkey up and carried the animal the rest of the way. As they crossed a bridge, they lost their grip and the donkey fell into the water to peril. Nobody wins.The selection committee was never going to get this year's final bracket exactly right. The head-to-head argument involving Notre Dame and Miami along with Alabama's blowout loss to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game wouldn't allow it.\nThey're not going to receive a failing grade from me, not after their original committee chair stepped down two weeks into the rankings and Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek was thrust into a speaking role and tossed into the gladiator ring when he never saw it coming. Let's get into these final decisions and determine if the right calls were made.Notre Dame vs. MiamiThe committee made it painstakingly clear through their first five sets of playoff rankings that Notre Dame was viewed as superior to Miami despite the head-to-head result in the season opener. The Hurricanes closed the initial eight-spot gap in the first rankings on Nov. 4 to now and then leaped the Fighting Irish on Sunday.Did the ground swell of national support for Miami over the last 72 hours and change alter the committee's viewpoint on the Hurricanes? Surely, much of the noise emanating from coaching staffs who played Miami and Notre Dame this season along with Nick Saban's outcries and others was heard by those gathering in Grapevine, Texas.\n\"We felt like, the way BYU performed in their championship game, a second loss to Texas Tech in a similar fashion, was worthy of Miami moving ahead of them in the rankings,\" Yurachek explained. \"Once we moved Miami ahead of BYU, we had that side by side comparison. … The one metric we had to fall back on was the head to head. We charged the committee members to go back and watch that Miami-Notre Dame game.\"On one hand, the committee understandably assessed the head-to-head win for the Hurricanes and that was enough to push Miami to the final seed. That's the correct move when using a ranking \"process that distinguishes among otherwise comparable teams\" according to protocol. However, why was that not determined over these final five weeks of play? What was the data point gained during conference championship weekend that reflected this change when both teams were idle?\nThe narrative is that since Notre Dame and Miami were finally next to each other in the rankings following 11th-ranked BYU's loss to Texas Tech, head-to-head finally came into play. It's almost as if the committee was trying to correct a previous wrong for slotting Miami at No. 18 in its debut rankings back on Nov. 4 before the Hurricanes won four straight -- convincingly -- to end the campaign.If that's the case, it's time for a new selection process, or at least a better explanation of how these teams are tiered and power-rated each week, leaving nothing up to assumptions.Yurachek said Saturday morning that the committee would re-rank teams after conference championships were decided while factoring in potential strength of schedule and strength of record changes involving common opponents. Only one team -- Boise State -- was in action that played either Notre Dame or Miami this season, and beat UNLV in the Mountain West Conference Championship.\nHow much of an impact did that make on the Fighting Irish's final ranking? It appears not much at all. My verdict: The committee rightfully included the head-to-head metric in favor of Miami. However, this should've been a conclusion weeks ago, not on Selection Sunday due to a BYU loss.Alabama's late-season fadeThe Crimson Tide did not look like a playoff team the final few games of the regular season, much like Notre Dame failing to pass the eye test early with consecutive losses to start. However, these rankings are made through the scope of an entire schedule and various important metrics are taken into account including strength of record, schedule strength and game control.\nThe committee had a choice to make with their final rankings: was it time to drop a potential era-changing hammer and devalue conference championship games by omitting the SEC's runner-up from the field for simply playing a bonus game as a 13th data point? In last year's playoff, we saw SMU drop two spots as the last at-large selection in the final rankings after losing to Clemson in the ACC title game.Pushing Alabama out would've led to immediate discussion points on torching the idea of future championship games for the SEC, especially if there was a chance in an expanded playoff that a loss in Atlanta would lead to being outside of the bracket.Yurachek's comments leading up to the final reveal alluding to the possibility of a bubble team being left out following a loss in a conference title game generated unnecessary worry for the Crimson Tide. And it certainly made Sunday's selection show likely ESPN's most-watched finale in the playoff era.\nHowever, Alabama's multiple ranked wins during the regular season -- namely the 24-21 victory at eventual SEC champion Georgia, the beginning of a challenging gauntlet the Tide ran through -- trumped anything Miami and Notre Dame had on their respective resumes.My verdict: Alabama's regular-season success showed the Crimson Tide were worth of inclusion. Had the committee excluded Alabama, the SEC Championship Game would have been devalued. I do not agree that Alabama was not docked at all for the loss, though. Crimson Tide should've been ranked No. 10.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Selection Sunday has come and gone, and the 2025-26 College Football Playoff is set with an unprecedented team atop the field as the undefeated, top-ranked Indiana Hoosiers shockingly stand atop the sport entering postseason play. On the back of its thrilling victory in a Big Ten Championship Game that pitted the top two teams in the nation against one another, Indiana (13-0) completed an undefeated regular season, knocking reigning national champion Ohio State (12-1) from its pearch and earning the No. 1 spot in the CFP Rankings along with pole position in the 12-team field for the first time in program history.The Hoosiers -- the second-losingest team since the advent of the FBS -- are participating in the playoff for the second time in as many seasons under coach Curt Cignetti. They were a No. 10 seed in the 2024-25 field, falling to Notre Dame in the first round. Indiana has never completed in a national championship game, let alone been crowned the top team in college football.The Buckeyes will nevertheless have a chance to defend their national title as the No. 2 seed in this year's proceedings. Ohio State is seeking revenge on Indiana and a third CFP crown in its seven playoff appearances across 12 years of the bracket's existence.Fresh off a dominant performance in the SEC Championship Game, Georgia (12-1) earned the No. 3 seed, failing to supplant OSU despite beating the only team that had defeated it earlier in the season. Big 12 champion Texas Tech (12-1) slotted No. 4. The top four seeds all receive first-round byes in Year 2 of the 12-team format.\nWith Duke (7-5) knocking off Virginia (10-3) to take the ACC crown, a Power Four champion will not be represented in the playoff field for the first time since it expanded to 12 teams. Instead, given that the five highest-ranked conference champions all receive automatic bids, two Group of Five league winners have advanced.Tulane (11-2) of the American earned the No. 11 seed as the fourth-highest ranked conference champion; it will visit No. 6 seed Ole Miss (11-1) in a rematch from Week 4, which the Rebels won 45-10 over the Green Wave. James Madison (12-1) of the Sun Belt picked up the No. 12 seed and will open the first round playing at No. 5 seed Oregon (11-1).All first-round games will be held at the sites of the lower-seeded teams placed higher in the final CFP Rankings.\nRounding out the opening matchups, No. 8 seed Oklahoma (10-2) will host No. 9 seed Alabama (9-3) and No. 7 seed Texas A&M (11-1) will see No. 10 seed Miami (FL) (10-2) come to town. The Sooners beat the Crimson Tide, 23-21, less than a month ago.Alabama is the first three-loss team to qualify for the playoff, while Miami was ultimately chosen as the last at-large team over Notre Dame (10-2). Though the Fighting Irish were listed two spots ahead of the Hurricanes in the penultimate CFP Rankings -- and neither team was in action on conference championship weekend -- Miami's win over Notre Dame in Week 1 likely led the committee to make a switch on Selection Sunday.Quarterfinal and semifinal games will be held at traditional New Year's Six bowl sites with Indiana designated for the Rose Bowl, Ohio State for the Cotton Bowl, Georgia for the Sugar Bowl and Texas Tech for the Orange Bowl.\nLet's take a look at the 12 teams that are competing for the national championship.The 2025-26 College Football Playoff field may be set, but these 12 teams are not the only ones that matter entering the postseason. Check out CBS Sports' live bowl games announcements coverage as well as the entire 2025-26 college football bowl schedule.2025-26 College Football Playoff bracket* Automatic bid | ^ First-round bye | ~ First-round host\n                                                                    Michael Meredith, CBS Sports\n                                                            No. 1 Indiana*^ (13-0): Indiana coach Curt Cignetti has the Hoosiers in the CFP for a second straight season with the program's remarkable turnaround reaching even greater, unexpected heights. Led by star quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the Heisman Trophy front-runner, IU survived tight road games against Iowa, Oregon and Penn State while crushing virtually everyone else on its slate before beating Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game.\nNo. 2 Ohio State^ (12-1): The reigning champions now have the opportunity to defend their title after seamlessly replacing both coordinators, their quarterback and numerous other stars from last year's championship-winning team. The Buckeyes began with a 14-7 win over then-No. 1 Texas and never looked back, nearly going wire to wire in the No. 1 spot had it not been for Indiana just hours before Selection Sunday.No. 3 Georgia*^ (12-1): The Bulldogs enter on a nine-game winning streak after thrashing Alabama in the SEC Championship Game to secure their third league title in the past four seasons. Georgia isn't as dominant as it was in 2021-22, it's back-to-back national championship campaigns, but it is a balanced and battle-tested team led by QB Gunner Stockton.No. 4 Texas Tech*^ (12-1): Bolstered by billionaire booster Cody Campbell, Texas Tech went all in on roster spending in 2025, and it is reaping the rewards. The Red Raiders' only loss came at Arizona State when QB Behren Morton was out due to injury. They have outscored opponents 245-43 over the last six games entering the playoff.\nNo. 5 Oregon~ (11-1): The Ducks overcame a rash of offensive injuries yet beat quality foes USC and Washington to close the season and secure their spot in the field. Oregon ranks No. 13 in total offense and No. 4 in total defense as it has established a \"no fly zone\" with just three opponents surpassing 140 yards passing in 2025.No. 6 Ole Miss~ (11-1): Winning 11 regular-season games for the first time ever under Lane Kiffin, who has since bolted for LSU, the Rebels enter the postseason with Pete Golding elevated from defensive coordinator to permanent head coach. He will lead Ole Miss into the biggest postseason game in program history.No. 7 Texas A&M~ (11-1): After beating Notre Dame on the road in Week 3 to establish itself on the national stage under second-year coach Mike Elko, Texas A&M went unscathed until a loss at rival Texas in the final game of the regular season kept it out of the SEC title game. The Aggies boast the nation's best third-down defense and a dual-threat playmaker in QB Marcel Reed, who is great at avoiding sacks\nNo. 8 Oklahoma~ (10-2): OU overcame season-long offensive struggles to pick up critical back-to-back road wins over Tennessee and Alabama to begin November. The Sooners are ruthless defensively, especially against the run, and have mastered the art of producing timely turnovers.No. 9 Alabama (10-3): The Crimson Tide slid into the field as the final at-large team despite a 21-point loss to the Dawgs on Saturday. However, Alabama beat Georgia on the road in September -- ending UGA's 30-game home winning streak -- and earned double-digit victories over Vanderbilt and Tennessee in October. When it clicks, the offense plays a methodical, clock-bleeding style that can grind opponents down.No. 10 Miami (FL) (10-2): The Hurricanes started hot with wins over Notre Dame, South Florida and Florida to rise all the way to No. 2 in the AP Top 25, but midseason losses to Louisville and SMU dampened their playoff chances for a while. Miami closed with four straight dominant wins to narrowly slide in as an at-large team thanks in no small part to Alabama's 21-point loss to Georgia on Saturday.\nNo. 11 Tulane* (11-2): Securing its spot in the CFP as the fourth-highest ranked conference champion after winning the American, the Green Wave are competing under coach Jon Sumrall, who is staying for the playoff run despite taking the Florida job. The offensive star QB Jake Retzlaff, a BYU transfer who has more touchdowns rushing (16) than passing (14).No. 12 James Madison* (12-1): JMU snuck into the field as the fifth-highest ranked conference champion after claiming the Sun Belt and watching as Duke beat Virginia to knock the ACC champion out of the final CFP Rankings. James Madison has won 11 games in a row since losing to Louisville in Week 2. Like Sumrall, coach Bob Chesney will lead the team in the playoff despite accepting the UCLA job.\n            ",

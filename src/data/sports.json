    "description": "\n        TAMPA, Fla. – To borrow a line from Bill Hader's fictional Saturday Night Live character Stefon, the U.S. men's national team's year has had ",
    "body": "\n        TAMPA, Fla. – To borrow a line from Bill Hader's fictional Saturday Night Live character Stefon, the U.S. men's national team's year has had everything – routine wins, uninspiring defeats, fresh faces and a new tactical vision. Even if USMNT onlookers have been trained to expect the unexpected, their final match of 2025 threw something completely new at the masses – a 5-1 obliteration of Uruguay, delivered by a completely rotated side full of cuspy players eager to make their case for a World Cup roster spot.The match started in routine fashion and then the goals felt like they came all at once. Sebastian Berhalter put the USMNT up by the 17th minute with an impressive strike but by the time Alex Freeman completed a brace in the 31st minute, habits had set in. The U.S. were essentially scoring whenever they felt like it, Uruguay's defense crumbling time and time again. Freeman's second goal is perhaps the trademark example – the Orlando City defender torched Barcelona center back Ronald Araujo, perfectly encapsulating the vibe of the night.\nDiego Luna had a goal of his own before the half and even on a tough evening for Uruguay, delivered a moment of brilliance with Giorgian de Arrascaeta's bicycle kick. A calmer start to the second half did not mean the eventful portion of the evening was complete – Rodrigo Bentancur's second yellow card in the 65th minute and Tanner Tessman's strike four minutes later kept the party going, another banger on a night full of them. Raymond James Stadium was far from full but for all those in attendance, it was time well spent. That was especially true for an unfamiliar version of the USMNT, who notched the first statement win since head coach Mauricio Pochettino took over as the head coach little more than a year ago.\nPochettino said on Monday that he would rotate through his team, in part to account for the quick turnaround from Saturday's 2-1 win over Paraguay, but rare are the occasions where the head coach wholeheartedly embraces a spirit of experimentation quite like he did on Tuesday. He made nine changes to his starting lineup, the group almost exclusively made up of players who needed to make their World Cup cases. Those players wasted little time doing so – Freeman has been on the inside track for a World Cup roster spot for months now but bolstered his argument, as did Luna.\nLuna and Freeman are perhaps the poster children of the Pochettino experience – neither was truly on the USMNT's radar before the head coach's arrival but continue to earn invites back to the national team and minutes on the field. Luna ends 2025 as the national team's cap leader while Freeman was the surprise star of the show in his home state, a classic example of why the head coach has called upon fresh faces to shake things up.\"That is our job, our duty to see the projection of the player and for that, we need to give the chance and to see how they perform, how they act, the character, the mentality,\" Pochettino said post-match about Freeman. \"[At] some point, it is to recognize some talent, but in the same way, it's to be brave to give the possibility to play. … For me, it's not our credit. We [only] create the platform for him to show the quality, but the credit is [for] him.\"But I'm so happy, so happy that he scored twice,\"  Pochettino continued. \"You need to analyze in the way that he plays – he can play like a third center back, he can play forward on the side, go inside. In the time that he took the ball, how difficult it is for the opponent to stop him, go inside and play. When he has the ball, the team is like – it's like a relief. It's how easy [he] plays.\"\nFreeman and Luna's teammates followed their lead on Tuesday, rising to the occasion in more ways than one. It was a declarative night for Berhalter, who had a goal and an assist by the 20th minute. The Vancouver Whitecaps player thrust himself into a crowded midfield conversation in the process, pestering Uruguay to the point that Bentancur was sent off for going for his ankle. He deputized in midfield alongside Aidan Morris, the pair holding down the fort just fine while veterans like Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie missed out on this month's camp for varied reasons.\"We know we have the quality to have performances like that, but I think it was about the DNA and the mentality going into games,\" Luna said. \"That was the biggest shift there and I think finding that and I think with whatever player we have on the field, we have the quality. I think it's just making sure we bring that mentality and that hard work mindset to every game.\"Those two, though, merely scratch the surface on how well Pochettino's insistence on experimentation has gone, nor is it the first time. Results have been inconsistent in the year-plus since Pochettino took charge but the one constant has been an unwavering commitment to ripping it all up and starting from scratch. The team may have looked aimless at times along the way, forcing questions about whether or not Pochettino has cast his net far too wide and sacrificed chemistry during a truncated run-up to the World Cup. Next summer's tournament may still be seven months away but Pochettino just might be in as good a position as he's ever been to take a victory lap. His team is unquestionably unfamiliar to the one that lost 1-0 to Uruguay in the final game of Gregg Berhalter's time in charge of the team, better for just about all the changes that he has made.\n\"We never doubted because we saw the quality of the players,\" Pochettino said. \"[It] was only to trust them and to give the possibility to find a way, to perform, to behave, to be in the way that we feel what [it] means to be professional.\"Now on a three-game winning streak and unbeaten in their last five, the USMNT keep finding different ways to collect victories. Saturday's gritty performance against Paraguay gave way for remarkable success on set pieces on Tuesday. Pochettino's side scored four of their five goals during those chances, several players' special skillsets coming to the forefront. Berhalter was a bright spot on those dead ball opportunities during the Concacaf Gold Cup and was impactful again against Uruguay, while left wingback John Tolkin called back upon his New York Red Bulls heritage and whipped in the corner that led to Freeman's first goal.\"I feel like we do work on it,\" Freeman said. \"It's a chance to score, so I think for us, it's just to be able to know that it's an opportunity to score and we need to be 100 percent at it. We can't take a set piece half-assed or be halfhearted. We want to be 100 percent at it. … For us, it's very good to be able to score that way.\"\nThe performance, both collectively and individually, provides Pochettino with a good set of problems with just one international break left to go until his World Cup roster is set. It may have created an unpredictable race to the finish in the process – which is exactly what Pochettino has hoped for all along.\"Honestly it makes it very difficult for Pochettino, knowing that a lot of these guys are coming in and making a big impact on the team,\" Freeman said. \"They're going to come in and give 100 percent and … [try] to turn heads, which one to pick. I think it just gives our pool a big showcase to different people and I feel like it just makes us a good nation to play with because you know that other people are going to come in at 100 percent and we have so many talented players in the pool so it's just be about being able to try to pick the best ones, come in 100 percent and be able to perform and I think it just brings good trainings and good international breaks.\"\n            ",

The San Antonio Spurs will take the court without the phenom Victor Wembanyama, who is expected to miss multiple weeks with a calf injury, and he's been integral to San Antonio's winning start to the season. The Spurs are favored by 5.5 in the latest Tuesday NBA odds at DraftKings against the Grizzlies, but without Wemby on the floor, the SportsLine Projection Model views this as too many points to lay. Instead, the model is including the Grizzlies to cover as 5.5-point underdogs as one of its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The Grizzlies are 8-2 in their last 10 meetings against San Antonio, and Memphis' over/under for total points scored on Tuesday is 114.5.The model also sees value in MACtion, backing UMass to cover as massive 33.5-point underdogs against Ohio in a 7 p.m. ET college football matchup as one of its Tuesday best bets.

The reason this is kinda low, I'm guessing, is that BGSU is the only FBS program to start four different QBs this season (due to injuries, etc.). I don't care. It's Akron. On the road.\" Back Bowling Green at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:UMass (+33.5) vs. Ohio (-112)You could make the argument that UMass is the worst team in the FBS, but 33.5 points is a huge number to give against a fellow MAC opponent. This is the most points the Minutemen have been underdogs by since playing Missouri, of the SEC, and UMass covered that 44.5-point spread in a 42-6 loss. Ohio is the defending MAC champions and has a 4-2 record in the conference this season, but the Bobcats aren't anywhere near the level of an SEC program such as Missouri. The model views 33.5 points as simply too many points in a conference matchup, despite UMass being 0-10 this season. Ohio hasn't won a game by more than 27 points this season, and it is 0-3 against the spread when favored by 11 points or greater this year. The model projects the Minutemen to cover the spread in 56% of simulations for this matchup airing on CBS Sports Network. Back UMass at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Grizzlies (+5.5) vs. Spurs (-105)Both teams are without their superstar, with Victor Wembanyama out for the Spurs and Ja Morant out for the Grizzlies as both players deal with calf injuries. Wemby was off to an MVP-caliber start, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 3.6 blocks per game, so although both players' absences significantly affect their teams' outlooks, the Spurs playing without their superstar could be the harder of the two to overcome. The Grizzlies will rely more on their size with players like Jaren Jackson Jr., Cedric Coward and Zach Edey, and without Wemby in the paint, that could be a significant Memphis advantage on Tuesday. The Spurs are 3-6-2 ATS as the favorite this year, and the model projects the Grizzlies to cover the spread in 61% of simulations. Back the Grizzlies at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Tuesday college football and NBA picks?You've seen some of the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The WNBA has made a new collective bargaining agreement offer to the Women's National Basketball Players Association that would raise the minimum salary above the 2025 maximum, according to the Associated Press. Furthermore, the offer would include a max salary above $1 million for the first time in league history. The current CBA was originally set to expire on Oct. 31, but the two sides agreed to a 30-day extension that made Nov. 30 the new deadline. This note from the AP suggests that the league does not want another extension or the risk of a work stoppage:\"People familiar with the WNBA's latest proposal described the plan to the AP as a highly lucrative package providing substantial increases over prior years and designed to bring negotiations to a quick conclusion.\"As the negotiations between the sides continue ahead of Sunday's 2026 WNBA Draft Lottery, here's a look at how the WNBA's reported offer could alter the current stalemate. How would the WNBA's reported offer change the salary structure?Minimum SalaryMaximum SalaryAverage Salary2025$66,079 (0-2 years) / 78,831 (3+ years)$214,466 $102,249WNBA's reported offer$220,000+$1,100,000+$460,000+Here are a few more key notes from the AP's report:The $1.1 million maximum salary would be available to multiple players per teamThe reported salary numbers would begin with the 2026 season and increase over the length of the CBAWhat have the players asked for?The players have outlined a number of key demands over the past year, including improved benefits and codifying charter flights. They've also discussed roster sizes, the schedule, officiating and the prioritization rule, though it's unclear where each item ranks on the priority list. Ultimately, though, the players want more money, not just in the form of higher salaries, but via a new revenue sharing model. \"If me and you aren't set on going to the correct restaurant, who cares what we're ordering as an appetizer?\" WNBPA first vice president Kelsey Plum said earlier this year. \"First, second, third is rev share (and) salary. So when I say that we continue to propose and the counter proposals that are coming back are further away from where we thought we would be, that to me is -- and I think a lot of the players are in agreement as a union -- this is literally the meat and potatoes.\"Under the current CBA, however, the salary cap -- and thus, player salaries -- increases at a fixed rate of 3% per year. The players are pushing for a new model where salaries grow with the business. Currently, players reportedly only receive about 9% of all revenue, a far cry from the 49-51% of basketball-related income that NBA players receive. While the current CBA does have a clause to trigger revenue sharing if the WNBA hits certain benchmarks, they have never been met, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n        \n            \n                WNBA CBA negotiations: Everything to know after two sides agree to extension\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWould the players be willing to accept the league's proposal?The players have thus far stood firm on their demand for a new revenue sharing model and, based on the AP's reporting, this offer would not satisfy that requirement. Instead, it appears that it would maintain the current system, where salaries increase at a fixed rate each year. This proposal is going to test their resolve, however. The minimum salary would more than triple for players with 0-2 years of service and nearly triple for players with 3+ years of service. The regular maximum salary would more than quintuple and the average salary would more than quadruple. That's going to be hard to pass up, especially for the rank-and-file players who aren't making significant money off the court.There's also the fact that no one wants to risk a work stoppage or, worse, missed games. It behooves both sides to come to an agreement so the offseason can go ahead unimpeded and the 2026 season can start on time. Without a new CBA, the expansion draft, free agency and the 2026 WNBA Draft cannot be conducted. The league is more popular than ever and a protracted labor fight could halt that momentum. None of that is to say the players should accept an unfair deal, but this is a serious offer that will require real consideration. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NEW YORK — On the 25th floor of the team hotel Tuesday morning, Kentucky players went through their customary day-of film session. At the end of the 10-minute scouting report through Michigan State's roster, a brief hype video played. The words \"FIGHT NIGHT AT THE GARDEN\" accompanied Kentucky basketball highlights interspersed with boxing prize fights of yore at Madison Square Garden.Kentucky's coaching staff knew Michigan State was going to arrive looking for a brawl. Associate coach Mark Fox had the scout and offered succinct advice.\"Pack your switchblades,\" Fox told the team. \"It's gonna be a street fight.\"Nobody checked the cargo on the way to the bus. Kentucky forgot their weapons and showed up with lemons to a knife fight.Michigan State — a team that entered the day shooting 21.7% from deep, ranking 352nd out of 365 teams — sliced UK in a most shocking way, sinking 11 of its 22 3-pointers and rollicking to an 83-66 Champions Classic win. \n\"Did we make more 3s today than we made all year?,\" MSU coach Tom Izzo said. \"That's not meant to be funny.\"What Michigan State did to Kentucky and its roster worth a reported $20 million-plus was no joke. The 12th-ranked Wildcats were outshot, out-hustled, out-schemed and outplayed by the 17th-ranked Spartans. Mark Pope's had only a few head-scratching losses in his 41 games running the program. Tuesday night's defeat was alarmingly bad, the worst of his young tenure. It was also the first time Pope ever coached against a Tom Izzo team, and boy did it look like it. \n\"The No. 1 failure of communication is assuming you've done it,\" Pope told CBS Sports prior to Tuesday's loss, later adding, \"words mean different things to all of us. Experience to attach those words to, they mean something very different.\"  The words would prove prophetic, because Kentucky is out of sorts and Pope is taking on all the blame. His messaging is obviously not getting through. We're still more than a week from Thanksgiving. Kentucky has more than enough time to get itself right. But it is the most disappointing team in college basketball through the first two and a half weeks of the season.\n\"We're far away from a team that we aspire to be and we can't waste a second on trying to grow into that,\" Pope said. \"We're disappointed and discouraged and completely discombobulated right now.\"All that preseason hopefulness, the top-10 hype and visions of improving after a terrific Year 1? It all disintegrated Tuesday night. This kind of crisis is the exact reason why Kentucky and John Calipari had to split 18 months ago — making way for Pope to restore unbridled optimism at his alma mater. Five games into the season, Kentucky sits at 3-2 with an 0-2 mark vs. high-major opponents, including the shot to the jaw last week against hated rival Louisville.Michigan State, conversely, is 4-0 with a pair of wins against SEC opponents; the Spartans fended off Arkansas 69-66 on Nov. 8.\n\"I've clearly failed ... up until today. But we won't fail this season,\" Pope said. \"I'm doing [the job] poorly. I won't do it poorly for much longer.\"It doesn't help that Kentucky's starting point guard (Jaland Lowe) and its best defensive player (Jayden Quaintance) are both unable to play due to injury. But this is a team with deeper problems than not having two key pieces. It paid millions and millions and millions to have the depth to overcome injuries. That depth was irrelevant against Michigan State.Kentucky was an offseason portal champ, but that guarantees nothing. And the rotation probably needs pruning.\n\"Their talent is obvious,\" Izzo told CBS Sports after the win. \"We watched the Arkansas tape and I told my staff, we've got the Lakers coming in. Then with these guys, it looked like the Lakers-Plus.\"Despite the praise, Izzo and Michigan State clearly saw room to exploit Kentucky on defense. Its weaknesses were evident and laid bare on Tuesday night, with Sparty putting up 1.17 points per possession. MSU point guard Jeremy Fears had a career-high 13 assists, highlighting a massive deficiency with Kentucky not having Lowe to offset Fears' floor-general mastery. Beyond that, Jaxon Kohler put up 20 points and role player Kur Teng had a career-high 15 points for Michigan State. Izzo's team played together. Played like it knew each other, trusted each other. \nKentucky looked like a team of talented players who still didn't know each other's full names. Does retention mean a lot in 2025 when it comes to having a shot to be really good?\"How about 100 frickin' percent?\" Izzo said. \"People playing for the front of their jersey. People that care about the place they're at and players they're with. ... Transfer portal recruitment is almost bigger than winning games. Not at Michigan State.\"\nIzzo was by no means taking a dig at Kentucky (which has players back from last season), but his opinion on the portal and the transactional nature of college basketball is well-documented at this point. On Tuesday night, his philosophy won out again — definitively.\"Their loyalty to me has gotta be my loyalty to them and that still frickin' matters,\" Izzo said.You know what's worse than being a high-profile team that underperforms? Being a high-profile team that underperforms while being purportedly the most expensive roster in the sport. The problem with spending big money on players is, if it goes sideways, that can become a stigma. It can become the identity of a team. It can become the thing most people talk about when they talk about your team.\nRight now, it is the identity for Kentucky. Because nothing on the floor can counteract it.\"My messaging is not resonating with the guys right now, that's my responsibility,\" Pope said. I've never seen Pope like I saw him Tuesday night at the postgame dais. It took him almost 50 minutes from the end of the game to even show up to the presser. He looked quietly angry but stubbornly determined. He had respectful but short answers to legitimate questions. He seemed, frankly, a bit shattered. Five games in, it's as though this is already an inflection point for the season. The UK staff knew this game was going to be a key learning opportunity, it's just that nobody saw a pasting of this level coming. \nMichigan State wanted a boxing match and Kentucky refused to engage.\"We knew it was going to be, as coach Izzo put it, a football game on the hardwood,\" senior Jaxon Kohler said. For as shellshocked as Pope seemed afterward, he knew his team was vulnerable beforehand. Prior to the game, I asked him what one big area of improvement was needed. He pointed out Kentucky's huge room for growth with being a tough team, a team that knows how to play their guts out and finding how to push their limits against the best competition. \"These guys could be physical, but how do you get them to embrace it?\" Pope said. \"You have just got to sell it every day. You just have to have the same conversation every single day. And then you move by one degree at a time. ... We may have to go through some real hell before we actually turn into what this group can be. I know we can figure it out.\" About eight hours later, Pope had few answers but maintained his faith in finding them. He promised this season wouldn't be a failure. A promise like that will be kept to account at Kentucky. Pope knew this job would come with challenges and never shied away from the pressure and criticism that would await the moment the team underachieved. That moment has arrived.Now he gets his first true test to find out how to fix a problem that is entirely of his making — and an expensive problem at that. How he does it will not just define Kentucky over the next four months, but will be a telling story arc to how he handles the toughest job in college basketball. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker & Bronson Reed), Logan Paul, Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, TBA and TBA vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and TBA: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After rising three spots in last week's College Football Playoff Rankings, Miami has surged again with a two-spot move to No. 13 on Tuesday night, pushing closer to the \"last team in\" designation as an at-large selection. The playoff picture within the ACC is messy with two weeks left in the regular season, and for the Hurricanes to be in the hunt for an auto-bid, they're going to have to win out -- and get help -- the rest of the way.The Hurricanes (7-2) are the selection committee's favorite in the ACC for the second straight week, but probabilities suggest it'll be Georgia Tech and Virginia playing in Charlotte for a conference title -- not Miami -- the first weekend of December. Under playoff protocol, five highest-ranked conference champions receive auto-bids in the 12-team bracket, so Miami is vying for one of seven at-large spots. Still four spots behind Notre Dame this week, the Hurricanes could use some assistance from teams ahead of them, including Oklahoma and Alabama, with preferred losses over their final games.Miami's College Football Playoff pathCollege Football Playoff ranking: No. 13Playoff seed: No. 11 (committee's projected ACC champion)Best wins: No. 9 Notre DameLosses: Louisville, SMURemaining pathat Virginia Tech (Nov. 22)at No. 22 Pitt (Nov. 29)No playoff berth starts without convincing wins over the Hokies and Panthers over the next two weeks.

As the ACC's highest-ranked team, the Hurricanes were the spot-filler at No. 11 in the projected bracket if the season ended today -- but it doesn't and there's work to be done from others within the ACC who need to toss a few alley-oops in Miami's direction.

    "body": "\n        There's a new team in the top four of the College Football Playoff Rankings. After a big win against Texas in Week 12, Georgia joined the list of projected first-round byes at No. 4 in Tuesday night's CFP bracket. The Bulldogs are still behind No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Indiana and No. 3 Texas A&M as the top three remains unchanged after three weeks. Georgia benefitted from Alabama's loss to Oklahoma, which vaulted three spots to No. 8 -- firmly in the field as an at-large -- after downing the Crimson Tide. Alabama, meanwhile, dropped all the way to No. 10, putting the Tide firmly on the bubble as the 2025 regular season winds down. The rest of the 12-team bracket remains largely unchanged, with one major exception: Tulane now makes the cut as a Group of Six representative. Fresh off of a 35-24 win against Florida Atlantic that saw them improve to 5-1 in conference play, the Green Wave landed at No. 24 in the rankings. \nThis bracket is a projection heading into Week 13. Here is a look at how the College Football Playoff bracket looks after the third CFP Rankings release. \n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            Alabama plummets Alabama's fall is something to keep an eye on. The Crimson Tide are currently situated as the last at-large in the field, a stark difference from the Week 12 rankings that saw them snag a projected first-round bye. Their early season loss to Florida State likely plays a big role in this. It's easily the worst loss among at-large teams, since the Seminoles are 2-5 in a relatively weak ACC. Losing at home as the favorite against Oklahoma also hurts Alabama. The Crimson Tide still have the inside track to the SEC Championship Game, but they're going to have to be flawless to close the regular season. \nIt will also be interesting to see how the selection committee treats a potential SEC Championship Game loss, especially with a one-loss team like BYU and a glut of two-loss power conference teams right behind the Crimson Tide. SMU, Penn State and Texas were able to make it in last season after losses in their respective championship games, so there is some precedent on Alabama's side.  \n        \n            \n                College Football Playoff Rankings reaction: Miami's rise complicates Notre Dame's picture-perfect CFP case\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKeep an eye on Utah The selection committee seems to hold Utah in high regard. The Utes are hanging around as the second team out, right behind in-state rival BYU.  Utah doesn't have a realistic path to the Big 12 Championship Game -- though it hasn't been entirely eliminated from contention -- thanks to losses against conference frontrunners BYU and Texas Tech. But it does have an easy close to the regular season. \nThe Utes have to get past Kansas and Kansas State, who boast a combined conference record of 7-7. If they can do that, and if a couple other projected at-large teams stumble over the next couple of weeks, then they could find their way into the final 12-team field. Confidence in the American Conference This is the third week in a row that an American Conference team has ranked first among Group of Six programs, as Tulane follows in the footsteps of Memphis and South Florida. It's becoming quite apparent that, barring some unforeseen meltdown, the selection committee will give an advantage to the winner of the American Conference Championship Game over any equivalent competitors. That's bad news for a team like James Madison, which has a better record than Tulane at 9-1 -- with its only loss coming on the road against Louisville -- and remains undefeated against Sun Belt opponents. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LeBron James, who will make his season debut Tuesday night vs. the Jazz, has spent the better part of two decades playing Atlas for franchises that would collapse without him to keep them aloft. He's also spent a good chunk of that time making it clear he was ready for that to change. Heck, that was what motivated him to ditch the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in the first place. As far back as 2017, he talked about handing the Cavaliers over to Kyrie Irving. That was eight All-NBA selections ago. The Lakers made a point of supporting him with ball-handling from the moment he arrived in Los Angeles and, when that wasn't enough, he pushed for the disastrous Russell Westbrook trade. The moves kept failing. James kept playing Superman.In fairness, it's all he's ever really done in the NBA, save perhaps the brief moments of overlap with a healthy, peak Dwyane Wade in Miami and the best of Irving in Cleveland. James has talked a big game about sharing the workload, but when the games actually start, 20 years of habits kick in and he tends to control everything. And hey, he's LeBron James. Who's gonna stop him? Even after the Lakers acquired Luka Dončić last February, there was a push and pull between the two. Dončić led the team in shots and usage, but at lower clips than he'd posted since his rookie season. James deferred for most of the game, but cranked his usage and shot attempts back up above Luka's by a meaningful margin in fourth quarters in both the regular season and their first-round loss to Minnesota. Dončić joined James' team on the fly in the middle of a season. The torch never fully passed.If there is a silver lining to James' absence thus far this season, it's that it has allowed the Lakers to find themselves without that question hanging over their heads. Dončić is settled and playing like an MVP, but just about everyone else is thriving as well. Austin Reaves is trending towards his first All-Star appearance. Rui Hachimura is having a career year and Deandre Ayton is having the bounce-back season the Lakers needed. For so long, James played on teams that needed him to do everything. Now, he's on a team that, at least thus far, really hasn't needed much of anything. He's getting what he's wanted for so long. He's also entering a situation he's never really played in before.His injury may prove helpful in that respect. He'll be reintegrated somewhat slowly. He said himself after his first practice with the Lakers this season that his lungs feel like a newborn baby's and that he'll need to get his wind back with real minutes over time. A couple of games with somewhat limited minutes will go a long way towards figuring out where exactly he fits onto this new team. It certainly helps that the Lakers have reached the cupcake portion of their schedule. Between now and the stretch in mid-December in which their games are currently unscheduled due to the NBA Cup, they'll play the Jazz twice, the Clippers, the Mavericks, the Pelicans, the Suns, the Raptors and the Celtics. They'll be favored in all of those games as long as they're reasonably healthy. They can afford to get a bit experimental.James will never be a role player. He's too good for that, team needs aside. But there's a balance here the Lakers should strive for. They don't need him to average 25 points per game. Something like 18-20 will more than suffice, with the hope that most of them come within the flow of the offense so as not to disturb the rhythm Dončić and Reaves especially have developed.\nGetting there should be relatively simple. More and more of James' points have come in transition in recent years, not because he's getting out and running more often, but because he's been more aggressive about finding his own, easier shots there while setting up teammates in the half-court, where creating his own looks is more taxing. He's become a far more eager catch-and-shoot gunner over the past few years as well. In Cleveland, he peaked at 1.6 catch-and-shoot 3s per game. With the Lakers, he's gotten as high as 3.5, a figure the current team would love for him to match or exceed, as they're taking the fewest catch-and-shoot 3s in the NBA by a wide margin so far this season. James, to his credit, recognized this as a key area coming into the season.\"I spent a lot of time on my catch-and-shoot 3-pointers,\" James said at media day in October. \" ... Understanding how can I make the most of when I don't have the ball, either moving into space. Obviously, Luka and AR [Austin Reaves] going to do a lot of time handling the ball. …We have a lot of guys that can handle the ball, so how can I still be effective on a team where I don't have to handle the ball as much?\"\nThat quote notably came before the extent of his injury was known. Dončić didn't have to assert his place as team alpha on the court. James was seemingly prepared to willingly cede it and his return to action will be our first glimpse into what his newfound role as a supporting player really means for him. It's probably going to be bumpy. There will be hiccups as the Lakers figure out how to reintegrate one of the most ball-dominant players of all time. But he's also among history's most versatile stars. By skill set, he's equipped to do whatever the Lakers need. Mindset and circumstance were always going to be the barometers here. His return will be our first glimpse into how he's going to handle this. It's something he's said he's wanted for quite some time and now the Lakers need him to embrace it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dallas Mavericks All-Star guard Kyrie Irving has been sidelined to start the season as he rehabs from the torn ACL he suffered in March. The Mavericks haven't given a definitive timeline on his return, though January has been floated before as a possibility. Irving has been seen during recent Dallas practices helping rookie Cooper Flagg work on his game, and he's reportedly \"ahead of schedule\" in his recovery, according to ESPN's Marc Spears.Irving is rehabbing with the intention of returning some time this season, according to Spears, who said someone close to Irving told him the veteran guard could return right now if it were the playoffs. Spears listed late January or the All-Star break in mid-February as potential return windows for Irving, whose presence would provide a boost for with a 4-11 record through the first month of the season. Irving would especially make things easier for a Mavericks roster that is severely lacking in backcourt depth. But given where this team is right now, would Irving's return actually be detrimental to Dallas' big picture outlook for the rest of the season?Why the Mavericks should prioritize the 2026 NBA DraftThis isn't about taking minutes away from anyone. Let's be honest, the fewer minutes the Mavericks get from someone like D'Angelo Russell at this point, the better. The Mavericks aren't struggling to find enough minutes for everyone on this roster, instead they're starting Brandon Williams -- who,  as impressive as he's been, was just on a two-way contract a season ago. To this point, Williams has been the most reliable point guard on the team, and when Irving returns, Williams should become his backup.\nThe Mavericks need Irving out there, if for no other reason than to have someone who can organize the offense, not turn the ball over and draw attention from the defense to make life easier for the likes of Anthony Davis and Flagg. Beyond that, pairing Flagg with an elite guard will only make him better and ease some of the pressure that's persisted for the No. 1 pick in the first month of the season.\n        \n            \n                Tearing down the Mavericks: Finding a trade for every player who can legally move (except Cooper Flagg)\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBut Irving's return also means the Mavericks could contend for a play-in spot at the very least, something they really shouldn't be doing. Now that Nico Harrison has been given the boot just nine months after trading Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, there's no need to play out this foolish plan to compete for a playoff spot -- especially when the 2026 draft class is expected to have some of the best prospects in recent memory. It's a draft class that should make several teams want to bottom out with the hopes of improving their chances at landing a top pick. And the Mavericks should be one of those teams that has a one-way ticket on the tank express. But Irving's return may result in winning too many games to give them a legitimate shot at landing a top three pick. Given that the Mavericks don't control any of their own first-round picks between 2027 and 2030, prioritizing the 2026 draft should be the goal.\nIt's time for Mavericks to build around Cooper FlaggIt will be a difficult line for the Mavericks to tow when Irving returns. Assuming Davis also returns in the near future from a calf strain, Dallas will have a healthy roster that is capable of being far more competitive than it has been to open the season. That would have been good news a month ago when Harrison was still in charge, but he's not, and Dallas doesn't have to force this fake championship window Harrison deluded himself into. Now it's about building around Flagg for the long-term future, and the first step in doing so is ensuring they're able to land as high of a draft pick as possible in 2026.There's already been talk of the Mavericks exploring the trade market for Davis, but they should also be doing the same for Irving after he returns. If he returns in mid-to-late January, and is operating at the levels he was prior to the ACL tear, it'll build up enough of a trade market to generate some interest from rival front offices before the Feb. 6 trade deadline. \nThe Mavericks have to untangle the mess Harrison got them in, which means recouping assets that they've lost. The only way to do that is through trades. Between now and the trade deadline, the only player who should be off limits is Flagg. And if it means getting closer to a top draft pick next summer, the Mavericks have to consider trading Irving.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        College football's coaching carousel is spinning wildly in the SEC and elsewhere this season and Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz has been linked to various openings. Rumored to be a candidate for Florida and LSU (behind Lane Kiffin), as well as schools like Penn State and Auburn, Drinkwitz addressed the job noise Tuesday ahead of Saturday's game at Oklahoma.Missouri started 5-0 this season but has lost three of its last five games to drop to 7-3. The Tigers' season took a turn when starting quarterback Beau Pribula was injured in the loss to Vanderbilt. Without Pribula, Missouri lost at home to Texas A&M before rebounding over the weekend with a decisive victory over 49-27. With the Sooners visiting Columbia, Drinkwitz tried to deflect the attention away from the coaching carousel and toward Saturday's game.\"You know, I'm not going to comment on message board chatter, tweets, sources. I've maintained with you and our team that my complete focus is on the task at hand,\" Drinkwitz said. \"You know, last week, people were tired of me because I couldn't win the big game. People had me meeting with my team and telling them that I was going to another school, none of which were true. \n\"Now, this week, it's a different story, because we scored the second most points in the SEC this year at 49 (against Missisippi State). So you know, all of this stuff is just a distraction. You know, I would like to remind everybody, including our fans, we absolutely love Mizzou. We love what we're building. We've been to six straight bowl games. We got the sellout streak going. Our administration has been nothing but phenomenal to me.\"\n        \n            \n                Latest coaching intel: Lane Kiffin's decision a true soap opera, Auburn search focuses on four names\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDrinkwitz won 11 games at Missouri in 2023 and beat Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl prior to last season's 10-3 finish. He's 45-27 overall in six years, including a 25-23 mark in SEC play.The SEC's 2023 Coach of the Year, Drinkwitz is signed through the 2029 season and trails only Kirby Smart, Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian for most overall wins in the conference over the last three years.\n\"Since I've been here, I've signed multiple extensions. In fact, I signed one this past summer. So all the speculation is really a tribute to [the administration], and it's a tribute to our team success and their commitment to our team,\" Drinkwitz said. \"And that's where my focus is going to remain, on our team and our current situation. And I'm not going to get into all that stuff, because, again, it's just a distraction.\"The book on Drinkwitz is impressive -- he's consistently been one of the SEC's best at his job who does more with less and has a penchant for finding gems in the transfer portal. Missouri signed 22 players out of the portal in the 2025 cycle and landed the seventh-best transfer class nationally per 247Sports.Former Louisiana-Monroe ballcarrier Ahmad Hardy leads the SEC in rushing this season with 1,346 yards and 15 touchdowns while former Division II Truman State running back Cody Schrader became the program's single-season rushing record holder in 2023 after registering 1,627 yards on the ground. Last season, former Appalachian State star Nate Noel rushed for 818 yards with the Tigers.\nWhile the NIL situation has improved at Missouri in recent years, including the signings of five-stars Luther Burden III and Williams Nwaneri, Drinkwitz has acknowledged his program falls behind the SEC's elite in terms of resources and funding.\"There's teams that we're playing with larger NIL budgets than we have,\" Drinkwitz said this week. \"Doesn't mean we're not doing the absolute best we can. Doesn't mean that we haven't put together a really, really good football team, and there's a lot of people helping us, but more is still more, and until there's a cap on it, we want every advantage that we can possibly get.\"During the broadcast of Missouri's win over Mississippi State in Week 12, commentator Tom Hart mentioned Drinkwitz's yearning for help from the eight Fortune 500 companies in Missouri. Any way the Tigers can find more pieces of the pie, they're going to do it, Drinkwitz said.\n\"If we want to get more and more opportunities for our student-athletes, then that's something that we need to lean into,\" Drinkwitz said. \"I'm always going to be pushing and trying to create whatever advantages we can for the University of Missouri in the NIL space.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the many who have laid the foundation for the rise of women's soccer, validation comes thick and fast these days. The NWSL and its clubs are not only willing, but able, to share key performance indicators that quantify the growth that was destined to come with adequate investment. The days of worrying about the league's general ability to survive are a thing of the past. There's a degree of normalcy that comes with that stability, but as concerns about durability subside, they pave the way for a new round of existential questions every league faces about supporting the flywheel of growth and maintaining relevance.The NWSL's batch of existential questions, naturally, make up an eclectic mix, especially in a year marked by instability. The foundation of the league may be set but in a year of transition, the road has been unusually bumpy, the prospect of losing the league's top star, which Berman has already addressed, essentially light fodder compared to the other events of 2025. The NWSL has had to contend with two on-field medical emergencies, a heat delay that reportedly inspired tension over a lost broadcast slot, discriminatory attacks on players – one time by another player – plus an investigation into a head coach for fostering a toxic workplace.Commissioner Jessica Berman has been busy, not only keeping up with a year's worth of unexpected events but also forcing her to explain herself time and time again. Perhaps a sign that she has made it as the commissioner of a major U.S. sports league, she has received the ire of fans, who have brought signs to matches asking for her removal and even booed her during a trophy presentation. The outrage may be something she survives -- she has reportedly already received a three-year contract extension, her current deal up this season -- but 2025 has forced Berman to apologize and defend herself more than once.\"I have said that it wasn't good enough and other than taking accountability for it and assuring people that we understand where we could have been better and that we're committed to being better, there's not much more I could say to make sure that they have confidence in in how we're going to show up,\" Berman said in an exclusive sit down with CBS Sports.\nThe trials and tribulations of 2025 leave the NWSL in a curious predicament and at an inflection point. Are these merely growing pains for a young league, or was this year a signal that the NWSL needs some recalibration to capitalize on the undeniable momentum of women's sports?'A league that is growing as quickly as we are'Berman and the league's decision-makers have admittedly not gotten every call right in a testing year but they have shown signs of progress, even if it was belated. Between the medical events experienced by Angel City's Savy King in May and Racing Louisville's Savannah DeMelo in September, the league has improved its procedures and finally implemented a process to suspend matches. The commissioner has also preached for a \"collective kindness\" for the league's players, a comment inspired by transphobic remarks directed towards some players, while admitting the process is ongoing to establish policy on the topic. Statements like these may have been hard to predict before the season started but the NWSL has had to learn to roll with punches.\"I think you have to expect the unexpected,\" Berman said. \"Certainly, in my role and for the league, it's our responsibility to be ready to meet those moments and to navigate through them. We won't always get every single thing right but hopefully we get the most important things right and in those situations, thankfully – I'm thinking about the medical ones in particular – the things that had to go right went right and so I'm very thankful for that and that's not an accident. Those are the systems and the medical protocols and the medical staff that our teams have hired that were able to show up in the way that they needed to be and in the face of crisis.\n\"With every season that we grow and become bigger and have more attention on us and more pressure, it requires that we also continue to invest in the foundation that supports the ecosystem. Some of that is governance. Some of that is reform and health and safety. Some of that is operations, policies and protocols and we're continuing to hire and make sure that we have the appropriate expertise and resources to confidently be able to navigate the things that we can't anticipate.\"Berman also said the improvement process is ongoing, some of it baked into the natural upgrades a young league would make during a period of rapid growth.\"We, of course, have analyzed a minute-by-minute of every situation that was challenging this year,\" she said, \"and made changes to communication protocol and how those decisions get surfaced and made in real time when there isn't a second to to regroup and and that's the best we could do for for a league that is growing as quickly as we are.\"\nSome of the unexpected events of 2025, though, feel somewhat unresolved. Take, for example, Albertin Montoya, the now ex-Bay FC head coach who was cleared of wrongdoing after a player alleged \"emotional distress,\" or a sexual assault case involving an employee of the San Diego Wave in which an NWSL investigation reportedly revealed that the club \"could have done more.\" The Montoya investigation may inspire issues around encouraging players to report their accounts through the NWSL's processes, while the Wave investigation may leave the alleged victims feeling unresolved and underserved.\"Without specifically commenting on those particular situations, I think I've said this before,\" Berman said. \"We're always looking at our policies to make sure that both drafted and being implemented in the best way possible and specifically consistent with the intent and we do that both internally and we do that with our Players Association in some instances and we'll always continue to do that. I think as an evolving organization, it's our responsibility to always have a mentality of in the aftermath of any situation, to have a practice of reviewing where we can improve and that is our culture at the league office. We come at the growth of this league with both confidence and humility, knowing that we have a strong responsibility to make sure that professional women's soccer is positioned to thrive in this country for the long term and that's going to require a lot of iteration and evolution and self-reflection about how we can show up in the best possible way.\"NWSL's mix-and-match business approachEven outside of the heightened attention of Women's World Cup and Olympics years, the NWSL's growth has trended upwards in a handful of categories – viewership on linear television, for example, is up 20% year over year and digital viewership increased 30% during that time frame. There's a sense of traditionalism to the NWSL's business approach, especially in broadcast – the $240 million deal it agreed with CBS Sports, ESPN, Amazon Prime Video and Ion is a mix and match of exposure of linear television and streaming, a varied package that mirrors most U.S. sports leagues.\nThe league seems to be casting as wide a net as possible in its pursuit of attracting new fans. While streaming broadcast slots are obviously flexible, the NWSL's linear television slots are almost always during the afternoon hours. Berman attributed that to the availability from the networks as well as individual clubs' attempts to bring fans to stadiums.\"There's a bunch of factors that go into making our schedule,\" Berman said. \"One of them is broadcast availability and the windows, but it's also our clubs and when they want to play their games and we try to have a strategic mix shift of game times and days for our teams. You can imagine that for young families, [the clubs] in some markets really prefer and enjoy having day games and in other markets, maybe less so but most often, those are the games that are more family-friendly. Those are the games that a lot of young kids come to and those are important community relationships for us to invest in and build and cultivate and then at night, you'll probably get a slightly different crowd and we are in this hyper-growth stage where we really want to give as many people an opportunity to discover and sample the NWSL, both on TV and in person, and that means we have to be nimble and flexible and provide a lot of optionality in terms of when and where and how they can attend and watch.\"The traditional approach extends to the expansion strategy in some ways. The NWSL granted Atlanta an expansion team last week, continuing a habit of slowly building a presence in the U.S.' top 10 media markets. Existing in those metropolitan areas specifically is a top priority for Berman, even if the situations are somewhat unideal -- 2026 entrant Boston Legacy will not move into their new stadium in time for their inaugural season, resigned to play their opening matches at the suburban Gillette Stadium. The Atlanta team, meanwhile, will also play at an NFL venue with artificial turf in Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which may have a cavernous vibe with the capacity reduced to approximately 28,000 when the team kicks off in 2028.\n\"It's definitely one of the considerations, and I would say it is a primary consideration, but it's not the only consideration,\" Berman said. \"We are keenly aware of the fact that we're going to be in media negotiations as this four year cycle concludes and the base of our geographic footprint being driven by where our teams are located is going to be a key factor in that, so being able to land Atlanta right now in 2025, knowing they're going to be playing in 2028 when our new media cycle becomes effective, is strategic. It's very important, but it isn't the only factor, and thankfully with Atlanta and Arthur Blank, there's lots of boxes that they check and we're really excited that we were able to get that done when we got it done.\"The foundation may be imperfect, but it is not unimpressive, though it may all hinge on the NWSL's primary value proposition -- its players. No matter the league's popularity, it has always been right to claim that it is the home of the best athletes in its sport, but Trinity Rodman's potential departure as a free agent magnifies the new realities of the women's game. Rodman will be a free agent at the end of the season, and the Washington Spirit may reportedly be hamstrung by the NWSL's salary cap in their attempts to retain her, prompting arguments that the league is resting on its laurels rather than meeting the moment.\n        \n            \n                NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman addresses Trinity Rodman's contract talks and defends salary cap structure\n                \n                    Pardeep Cattry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe NWSL's teams are more deep-pocketed than they used to be, which seems opportune as transfer fees grow exponentially, American and European clubs smashing the record on the regular. Berman, who has been at the helm as the league inked its greatest-ever broadcast deal and has watched expansion fees and team valuations skyrocket, was surprisingly conservative in her view of the salary cap.\n\"We want to make sure that this league is thriving and is the best league in the world, not just in 2026 but in five, 10, 50, 100 years,\" she said. \"There needs to be a long-term lens on how you think about those things and if you look back in history over the last few years, we've quadrupled our salary cap so we're investing. Our owners are investing hundreds of millions of dollars and we want to do that in a way that's smart and supported by revenue growth and is done strategically.\"\n            ",

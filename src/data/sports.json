    "body": "\nTottenham Hotspur, in some sense, are testing the limits of what it means to be a team in crisis. They sit just three points out of a top four spot in the Premier League and enter Matchday 5 of the UEFA Champions League in 10th place, everything seemingly in order for a team with their means and under new management in mid-November. Spend any amount of time watching Spurs, though, and that form does not meet the eye test at all – Thomas Frank's side has racked up a series of drab performances, one of the few throughlines in a season full of disappointing inconsistencies.Three months into the job, it is difficult to parse out what exactly Frank wants Spurs to look like on the pitch. Frank does have a default mode – he oftentimes anchors his midfield with the duo of Joao Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur, preferring to almost exclusively play the ball forward through his fullbacks, usually some combination of Pedro Porro, Djed Spence and Destiny Udogie. The ex-Brentford manager has tinkered with the rest of the team in an attempt to take his team out of first gear, finding few fixes and instead muddying the tactical vision in the process.Default mode or otherwise, the plans have not exactly panned out. Frank feels like an antidote to his predecessor Ange Postecoglou, under whom Spurs were remarkably porous in defense, his overreliance on Palhinha and Bentancur almost self-explanatory given the team's needs and the new manager's reputation. Yet, Frank's side have just one clean sheet in their last eight Premier League matches, their ultra-conservative approach still leading them to concede four goals at Arsenal on Sunday.How to watch Paris Saint-Germain vs. Tottenham Hotspur, oddsDate: Wednesday, Nov. 26 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Parc des Princes -- Paris, FranceLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Paris Saint-Germain -290; Draw +420; Tottenham Hotspur +800Pick: PSG 2, Tottenham 0On top of that, Frank seems to have sacrificed the one thing that was working under Postecoglou in the process – the team's offense. Spurs may rank fourth in the Premier League for goals scored with 20 through 12 games but they have dramatically overperformed in that category. They rank 17th in the league in expected goals with 11.19, posting more than one expected goal in just three league games this season. The end product was especially paltry in recent defeats to Arsenal and Chelsea, posting 0.07 xG and 0.12 xG , respectively, in those matches.Frank apologized to Spurs fans after Sunday's loss in the North London Derby but he coupled that with an attempt to distance himself from some of the team's problems, several of which were not of his creation.\"I think there's definitely a lot to work on still,\" Frank said on Sunday. \"I think it's fair to say that we are very disappointed and unhappy with the performance today. I don't want to run away from that. I apologise to the fans. I think it's also fair to say where we're coming from. We finished 17th last year. And we've tried to build something, which today didn't look like we tried to build something.\"He is not necessarily wrong to point out how poorly Spurs fared last season. Despite winning the UEFA Europa League and booking a spot in this season's edition of the UEFA Champions League as a result, their injury-plagued season and Postecoglou's approach doomed them to a finish one spot above the relegation zone. Years of poor squad-building has not helped, either – Frank's approach to bypass midfield in building attacks was perhaps his only solution to inheriting a team with very few natural passers, especially with James Maddison on the sidelines after tearing his ACL in August. It may feel harsh to say but Spurs might have assembled a midtable squad over the years, something Frank seemed resigned to in his pre-match comments ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at Paris Saint-Germain.\"Performances can always be a bit up and down,\" Frank said on Tuesday. \"In a 60-game season, there will be 10-12 perfect games, 30 or so [in the middle] and then the rest below that. You can be defeated [against Chelsea and Arsenal] but the others we were still competitive … we will keep working at it.\"That, though, almost absolves him of too much responsibility. Spurs' defense has improved since Frank took charge, but that is faint praise for a team that conceded nearly two goals a game in Premier League play. The team's attack is undoubtedly worse, going from an average of 1.6 xG to one of 0.9 xG per game in the league. Frank is missing Maddison and Dominic Solanke, who has essentially missed the whole campaign so far with an ankle injury, but his Brentford team last season also averaged 1.6 xG last season, much better than his Spurs team so far.It makes the encouraging performance against PSG in the UEFA Super Cup feel like a very long time ago, though it may also act as a perfect source of inspiration as Frank once again goes back to the drawing board. They will not have the benefit of playing a PSG side that was fully in preseason mode but there was a dynamism to Spurs that felt like the best of Postecoglou's and Frank's tactical worlds. Wednesday's trip to Paris may not be a make-or-break game for Frank, who still has the opportunity to turn things around. He will need to do so sooner rather than later, though, before he runs the risk of becoming a manager who was not ready for the demands of being amongst Europe's elites.\n            ",

I ran a lot, I scored a lot of goals but above all, I've always had pretty good vision of the game and since I was a little kid.\"I don't know, watching Messi especially, he made different passes because I've seen a lot of players who are very good at passing who made long passes but Messi made passes that were almost a goal and I would learn from that. I've seen [Luka] Modric make passes with the outside of the foot. Those are things I really liked and found more interesting than dribbling because they're somewhat more clever.\"\nYamal is also renowned for his goalscoring ability, currently standing at 37 goals in 144 games for club and country in his short career. The 18-year-old said there are four goals that stick out in his mind as favorites but he singled out two, the first being his goal in Spain's 2-1 win over France in the semifinals of Euro 2024, a tournament his side went on to win.\nThe second was just this month in Barcelona's 3-3 win at Club Brugge in the UEFA Champions League, a stellar strike taken with the inside of his foot.\n\"If I had to choose only one, I think in terms of importance and beauty, it'd be the goal against France at the Euros and I also really like the one against Brugge.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Davis is No. 2 on the Fanspo NBA trade machine's list of trending players, but I do not recommend trying to come up with realistic deals for him. It is a frustrating exercise, and there's a decent chance it will bum you out.In theory, Davis' situation should be simple: He's turning 33 in March, and the Dallas Mavericks aren't set up to succeed on his timeline. Both sides would be better off with a trade that sends him to a win-now team in exchange for a package of younger players and draft picks.Every expert agrees, though, that the Mavericks can't expect anybody to give up all that much for Davis. It doesn't matter that he was the centerpiece of the Luka Dončić trade less than 10 months ago, and it doesn't matter that he made Second Team All-NBA 17 months ago. \"There's not a lot of teams that are lining up\" to acquire Davis, ESPN's Tim Bontemps said on Monday's episode of the Hoop Collective. In the immediate aftermath of the Nico Harrison firing, The Ringer's Zach Lowe said that the difference between what the Mavs gave up for Davis and what they'll eventually get for him \"will set the world record for the biggest delta in trade returns for one single player in the history of professional sports.\"The big issue is not that Davis arrived at training camp well above his normal playing weight. It's not that he strained his calf a week into the regular season, either. It's his contract.\nDavis is making $54.1 million this season, is owed $58.5 million next season and has a $62.8 million player option in 2027-28, the season in which he will turn 35. Next August, he'll be eligible to sign an extension that would pay him as much as $275 million over four years and as much as $76 million in 2030-31, the season in which he will turn 38.The first hurdle is finding a team that is mechanically capable of putting a trade package together. That front office not only needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention; it needs to believe it's a Brow away from championship contention even after taking into account the loss of the players it is trading away. Those players' 2025-26 salaries must total at least $43.1 million, and that team's post-trade payroll cannot exceed the first apron.The second hurdle is finding a team that isn't scared of what it will have to pay Davis down the road. It doesn't necessarily have to be willing to offer him a four-year max extension next summer, but it must be confident that it can extend him on a more team-friendly deal or be comfortable with Davis either hitting free agency in 2027 or picking up his 2027-28 option. Negotiating with future Hall of Famers in their mid-30s can be difficult.\nAnd these obstacles are just about one side of the equation. Let's say Davis returns to face his old buddies in Los Angeles on Friday, plays at an All-NBA level for the next few weeks and motivates a few teams to try to trade for him. Will these hypothetical suitors be willing to -- or even have the ability to -- trade multiple first-round picks for him? If not, will the Mavericks be interested in the young players that are on the table? It's easy to say that the Mavs \"should\" trade Davis, but I have yet to see a fake trade involving him that seems both plausible and a no-brainer for them. It is not clear what bar must be cleared for them to find an offer acceptable.If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it's essentially the same story that we've seen with a number of stars under the NBA's latest collective bargaining agreement. There was not a robust trade market for Jimmy Butler, and the Miami Heat ended up accepting a package of Andrew Wiggins, Davion Mitchell, Kyle Anderson, a 2025 first-round pick (that landed at No. 20 and turned into Kasparas Jakučionis) in exchange for Butler, Josh Richardson and two second-round picks. The Phoenix Suns traded Kevin Durant for a fraction of what they'd given up to get him. The trade that ended Brandon Ingram's tenure with the New Orleans Pelicans wasn't strictly a salary dump -- they got a protected first-round pick out of it -- but it felt a lot like a salary dump, didn't it?In Jake Fischer's latest newsletter at The Stein Line, he writes that the Charlotte Hornets aren't interested in moving LaMelo Ball in part because they are \"unlikely to get the sort of offers for Ball they'd be hoping for,\" which he describes as \"somewhat reminiscent of the situation Anthony Davis faces in Dallas.\" He also writes that the Sacramento Kings are \"unlikely to bring back a significant haul\" for Domantas Sabonis, Zach LaVine or DeMar DeRozan. All of these players are former All-Stars, and it's not as if the whole league has decided they're bad. DeRozan is the only one making less than $38 million this season, though, and, in this landscape, acquiring any of them is complicated.\nGenerally speaking, good teams are not looking for complicated. They don't want to blow up what's working, reorient everything in the middle of the season or set themselves up to be in salary-cap hell a couple of years from now. As trade season approaches -- it unofficially begins on Dec. 15, the day that most players who signed new contracts last summer will be eligible to be traded -- big names like Davis are bound to get the most attention, but they're not the ones who will have the most suitors.If you're a buyer, your ideal target is probably a younger player who complements your core players on both ends, can defend multiple positions, doesn't need tons of touches and is on a relatively cheap contract. This is why the only player ahead of Davis on the Fanspo's NBA trade machine's trending list is a fourth-year guard who is making $2.3 million this season: the Kings' Keon Ellis. According to The Stein Line, more than half the league has called about him.\n            ",

Despite signing a two-year, $13 million deal with New Orleans in free agency, the 32-year-old was never a focal point in Kellen Moore's offense, catching 19 passes for 165 yards and zero touchdowns in 10 games played.Cooks is used to changes of scenery as he has played for five different franchises over his 12 NFL seasons: the Saints, New England Patriots, Los Angeles Rams, Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys. That number increases to six with Buffalo. The former No. 20 overall pick out of Oregon State has six 1,000-yard receiving campaigns. He even became the first player in NFL history to cross 1,000 yards receiving in three consecutive seasons with three different teams from 2016-18 with the Saints, Patriots and Rams.\n\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: Who's in, who's out and who's in the hunt as the NFC and AFC races heat up\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt remains to be seen what Cooks can provide as a playmaker in this stage of his career, but he did catch 54 passes for 657 yards and eight touchdowns two years ago with the Cowboys. While the Bills statistically have a top-10 passing offense with 234.6 passing yards per game, an addition to Josh Allen's arsenal was needed. Khalil Shakir is the Bills' leading receiver with 564 yards, but that ranks No. 32 in the NFL. Curtis Samuel missed the Week 12 upset loss to the Texans with elbow and neck injuries, Mecole Hardman missed that same game with a calf injury and then former No. 33 overall pick Keon Coleman has been made a healthy scratch in each of the last two weeks. \nEntering a Week 13 road matchup with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Bills are 7-4 and 2.5 games back of the New England Patriots in the AFC East standings. \n            \n    ",

If his suspension stands, he will miss Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams. Jennings has not yet been reprimanded for his punch. \"I'll take that one,\" Moehrig said after Monday's loss to the 49ers, via ESPN, refusing to provide more context for his actions. \"He wanted to do a little dirty stuff, so it is what it is, man.\" \n\"The TV is gonna tell you what happened,\" Jennings said following the game, via The Athletic. \"To me, I was just responding to some childish behavior.\"      \n        \n            \n                49ers' Jauan Jennings throws postgame punch at Panthers player in retaliation for 'cheap shot' low blow\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n49ers coach Kyle Shanahan defended Jennings, arguing that he was level-headed in his response relative to what could've happened.\"The guy took a cheap shot and hit him in the balls,\" Shanahan said following the game. \"I was real proud of Jauan for not losing his mind out there.\"  \nThe Panthers fell to 6-6 with Monday night's loss while the 49ers improved to 8-4. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lamine Yamal's star power is such that the spotlight is permanently fixed on him, earning his role as the focal point of Barcelona's attack and the attention of an audience, both in a stadium and in front of a screen, when he takes to the pitch. It makes complete sense, then, that Chelsea would fixate on the 18-year-old as he arrived at Stamford Bridge for a high-stakes UEFA Champions League encounter, a win thrusting either side back into the conversation for a top-eight berth in the league phase and direct passageway to the round of 16. The Blues' focus was not misguided – the hosts successfully neutralized Yamal en route to a 3-0 win over Barcelona on Tuesday, their most impressive result of their Champions League campaign.Barcelona can point to different anomalies that worsened the deficit – Jules Kounde's comical first-half own goal kicked off a bad day that only got worse with Ronald Araujo's second yellow card just before halftime. The astounding thing about Chelsea's performance, though, is that those abnormalities merely accentuated the difference between the two sides. By the time Araujo's 44th-minute red card had permanently given the Blues a personnel advantage on the field, the damage was already done.\nChelsea played a fairly even first half with Barcelona, only slightly behind them in terms of possession, touches and attempted passes. There was one key difference – the Blues' high-intensity approach was built with limiting Barcelona's high-caliber attack in mind, especially with Robert Lewandowski returning to the fold after a months-long injury spell. The visitors had just three shots by the time the halftime whistle blew, their lowest first-half shot total all season long.Unsurprisingly, limiting Yamal was instrumental in unraveling Barcelona. The 18-year-old had just 64 touches, the fewest he has had in a single match between LaLiga and the Champions League this season, completely limiting his capacity to launch Barcelona's attack. He had a below-average passing night with a 72.2% passing accuracy from 36 passes, far below his season average of 80.8%. Again, this was not merely a result of playing down to 10 in the second half – his 32 first-half touches were on par with his season average and the same goes for his 18 passes before the break. The Blues were not simply trying to push him off the ball; a handful of players took turns marking him in groups, closing off his passing lanes. His passing accuracy stood at 66.7% in the first half, though, making it one of his worst halves this season from that perspective.There was another teenager who stole the spotlight instead – Chelsea's Estevao, three months' Yamal's senior and in the midst of a breakout season. He nabbed the Blues' second in the 55th minute, dribbling past Barcelona's Alejandro Balde before making his way into the box and scoring from a tight angle, the latest in a month full of stellar finishes. The Brazil international notched his ninth goal for club and country in a month and became the second youngest player to score in each of his first three Champions League starts, behind only Kylian Mbappe.\nThe comparisons to some of the game's greats do not end there. Estevao earned the praise of Thierry Henry and Jamie Carragher post-match, who whittled off names like Diego Maradona and Robert Pires in their analysis. Carragher also compared the 18-year-old to Henry in his ability to dazzle, the pair impressed by Estevao's ability to dribble past whichever player is in front of him on the wing.\n\"Even if you watch football, even great teams, they'll only have one player on the team who can really dribble,\" Carragher said on the UEFA Champions League Today post-match show. \"I think most players will get it and pass it and when you've got someone who can do it – that's why we love Maradona … Even though we've all played at the top level, we know how difficult it is to dribble through players. That's why [Henry is] revered as the greatest player to play in the Premier League, because you've scored goals and you've done things that no one else can do. People can score a great goal or could be lucky or could be quick or could defend or could play a nice pass. We can all do that. We've all done that on occasions but if you can't dribble, you can't dribble. You can't go past players and that's [why] I think it's so special so see somebody have that.\"Estevao and his teammates may have had the benefit of playing against Barcelona's perennially leaky defense but Tuesday's goal was not a one-off. He scored a very similar strike in the Club World Cup against Chelsea, shortly before the Blues' 2-1 win in Philadelphia would mark Estevao's final game for his boyhood club Palmeiras.\n\"The first quality of the kid is to dribble. Why are you going to take that away?\" Henry said. \"If I don't make you run and I pass the ball all the time, it's an easy job for you as a right back or a left back. Let him cook. Let him play. We need to enjoy these types of players or these types of games.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS — When a sporting event's format becomes a bigger story than the actual games, you've got a problem.And for the moment, the Players Era has a problem. An image problem at least. A comprehension problem. After two days of some really good basketball, here's what awaits on Wednesday:No. 7 Michigan vs. No. 12 Gonzaga (championship game)No. 17 Tennessee vs. Kansas (third-place game)That's a terrific doubleheader, of course. The championship game will be for $1 million in additional NIL money, with $500,000 going to the loser. The Tennessee-Kansas winner will get another $300,000, with the loser getting $200,000.Those four teams went 2-0 over the past two days.But so did No. 15 Iowa State. But because of two plays and four points in two games 24 hours apart, Kansas will play for more money, while Iowa State will be boxed out. What's the Cyclones' reward? A game against 4-2 Syracuse at 10 a.m. local time on Wednesday.\nHere's why that's happening. Late buckets mattered On Monday, St. John's Dillon Mitchell had a put-back as time expired to make Iowa State's win over the Red Storm 83-82 instead of 83-80. Then, on Tuesday, Kansas' win against Syracuse was well in hand and surely decided. With less than 30 seconds to go, KU's Kohl Risario threw down a slam to increase the lead from 69-60 to 71-60. Kansas' point differential after two games was 21. Iowa State was 19. That's why Kansas has an opportunity in a money game, while ISU gets what may well be a Quad 2 result vs. a Syracuse team that has played well here but still failed to win a game. There are more reasons for teams to have gripes. Consider how Tennessee had to bludgeon its way past No. 3 Houston in what was almost certainly the most physically punishing game of the first two days. But the Vols don't get to play in the championship game for the most money because they were matched up with the highest-ranked opponent in the 18-team Players Era field.\nIt's all happening because of a statistical tiebreaker that's traditionally kept to the likes of high-profile soccer tournaments, where scoring is at a premium in that sport and pool play typically includes round-robin competition.The Players Era doesn't apply to either of those scenarios, though. \"We do something different so actually you're not just watching the same thing you've been watching every November, just with more teams,\" co-founder Seth Berger said. \"We're trying to bring November basketball to more casual fans, so clearly one of the things we have to do is continue educating about why our format is unique and it's exciting. In this format every shot matters, every basket matters, every minute matters.\"I'll admit: Having every game and every basket matter is a concept that has some positives. It's different from traditional bracket play and brings on-court relevance to more games. But casual fans associate college basketball tournaments with brackets. It is the very essence of November basketball, let alone what March Madness is literally built upon. \nBracket play works.And even though this is Year 2 for Players Era, it's effectively Year 1 because last season's eight-team event really didn't pierce the public consciousness.So the PR rollout has been mixed. Most fans can't easily follow what's happening, even if the games have been good. (And plenty of them have.)There's nothing that will be done about this year. The matchups were determined at 12:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday morning/9:30 p.m. PT, and if you've made it this far into my column wondering just who the heck is playing each other, this is Wednesday's schedule: \nSyracuse vs. No. 15 Iowa State1 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNotre Dame vs. No. 3 Houston3:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaThird-place: Kansas vs. No. 17 Tennessee7 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaNo. 14 St. John's vs. No. 21 Auburn8 p.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden ArenaChampionship: No. 13 Gonzaga vs. No. 7 Michigan9:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaBaylor vs. San Diego State10:30 p.m. (truTV) at Michelob Ultra ArenaMaryland vs. No. 8 Alabama12 a.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaWe'll write, talk and react to all of Wednesday's games on Wednesday. Format in fluxI want to stay on the larger issue, which is what to do about the format in the years ahead. Next year the event is going to 32 teams. It will be the biggest regular-season event in the history of college basketball. Those 32 teams will be split into four eight-team pools. From that, the four teams that win their pool play (against three other teams in predetermined matchups that will be made next offseason) will do so based on best record ... and then point differential/margin of victory as the decider. \"Those four teams will each play in one more game, a first-place game and a third-place game,\" Berger said Tuesday at a press conference here. \"The system, over time, I think will be pretty simple and understandable to fans. What we're trying to do here, and I think it's an interesting question because for basketball fans or parents or coaches who have played in AAU events, this is relatively standard, this kind of happened every single weekend when you go to an event.\"Berger and co-founder Ian Orefice have faced a lot of skepticism and backlash over their event because of its expensive and unprecedented nature. But they're doing good things for the players. More than 200 Division I athletes involved in this event are going to be paid significant money in NIL opportunities. It's a positive for the sport.\nThe next step is making sure the event can bring in fans and have a format that isn't hard to follow. Keeping options openA silver lining for anyone hoping the current format can switch to something more traditional: Orefice told me Tuesday night that it's not a certainty that the future of the event will be pool play that has to include point-differential tiebreakers. \"We're open to all feedback,\" Orefice said. \"Nothing is 100% set moving forward. We're committed to four eight-team pools next year, almost definitely, but we'll see.\"\nOrefice said they'll take in the opinions from every team in the event as they look to planning in 2026 and beyond. Orefice added that the primary goal — what they refer to as a \"North Star\" — is to make Players Era good as possible. Orefice made a point to say he Berger aren't going to act like they have all of the answers and be resistant to any type of change. They've created something that has upended the sport's November calendar — and it stands to be a behemoth in the years ahead, provided it put on an event that's TV-friendly, fan-friendly and easy to follow.Asking fans to stay up late to find out matchups for every team less than 16 hours before the games will be played isn't great for fans — or coaches. I had one staff in this year's field text me after 8 p.m. local on Tuesday to ask if I had the scoop on who they were playing. You never want that.  It's only Year 2 and the event will continue to evolve, but if it wants to reach its maximum potential as a sports entity, it would probably be best to determine a way to make bracket play the skeleton of Players Era moving forward. Make the wins and losses matter most — and not leave the style points as tiebreakers. If the event can get to that place in the next year or two, then it will truly be what the founders envisioned: a tournament that embodies the spirit of March Madness and all the good that comes with it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If No. 7 Ole Miss beats Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl on Friday to finish its regular season at 11-1, the Rebels are headed to the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history as one of the selection committee's seven at-large picks.They've earned it -- even if that means taking the field for the first round without the coach who helped lead them there.Don't buy the doomsday scenarios suggesting Lane Kiffin's potential departure to LSU will keep Ole Miss out of the 12-team bracket. While that would be a new \"data point,\" according to committee chair Hunter Yurachek. An 11-win SEC team isn't getting tossed aside.It would be unfair to penalize the players after a terrific three-month stretch. The reward is a playoff appearance.\n\"We didn't have any discussion about Ole Miss and their coach,\" Yurachek said, while acknowledging it could factor into seeding if Kiffin leaves. \"That was all about Oregon and their performance against USC. Their strength of schedule continues to climb. The committee's been waiting for them to have a signature win.\"Kiffin deflecting the spotlight and boosting his players ahead of the widely projected conclusion that he's on the way out. While his offensive acumen is notable -- and he has schematically set transfer quarterback Trinidad Chambliss up for tremendous success -- he hasn't thrown a touchdown pass, made a tackle or raced to the end zone.\"They're the ones making the plays, not me,\" Kiffin said during an appearance on ESPN last week. \"All this success, all this credit and these things, it's because of the players and the assistant coaches putting it all together and making this stuff happen.\"\nThat covers every base in describing Ole Miss as one of the nation's \"best teams,\" which is the committee's mission during deliberations. However Ole Miss' seeding could be impacted by Kiffin's exit, a source close to the committee told CBS Sports last week.Among the four principles the committee uses to split otherwise comparable teams, \"other relevant factors\" can include the \"unavailability of key players and coaches that may have affected a team's performance during the season or likely will affect its postseason performance.\" That could be viewed as a negative for the Rebels.The Florida State precedent was set in 2023 when the committee excluded the unbeaten Seminoles after Jordan Travis suffered a season-ending injury.\n\"I feel they aren't nuked like FSU,\" the source said.The final voting process includes seven rounds of ballots. Members first select a pool of six teams to evaluate, then rank them in groups of four across four rounds before finishing the final three rounds in groups of three. In the second round of voting, the four teams slotted at Nos. 5-8 -- the first-round home-game seeds -- are determined. This is where a potential Kiffin departure could come into play.Ole Miss isn't jumping No. 5 Texas Tech or No. 6 Oregon if those two win out. No. 8 Oklahoma could strengthen its case to push ahead of the Rebels if it throttles a bowl-bound LSU -- a common opponent for both.The plot thickens if Ole Miss loses at Mississippi State and joins the logjam of 10-win teams in the at-large mix. Here's a look at both scenarios for the Rebels based on intel we've received and what could unfold.\nIf Ole Miss beats Mississippi StateA source close to the committee says the Rebels can punch their playoff ticket in Starkville with a win, though seeding could be affected if Kiffin leaves afterward and takes his coordinators with him. That concern becomes moot if Ole Miss announces Saturday that Kiffin has signed an extension -- first-round home game secured.If Ole Miss loses at Mississippi StateThe Rebels would finish 10-2, along with Oklahoma, Notre Dame and Alabama if those teams win as favorites entering conference championship weekend. Toss in BYU and Utah and there's two more additions to that at-large grouping with Cougars being an 11-win team.Entering rivalry week, CBS Sports projects five locks in the 12-team playoff bracket — Ohio State, Indiana, Texas A&M, Georgia, the Big 12 champion (Texas Tech or BYU), Oregon, the Group of Five champion (Tulane or North Texas) and either the ACC champion or a second Group of Five conference champion. That leaves four spots for others.Final projectionNo matter Kiffin's final decision, we're expecting the Rebels to find a spot in the 12-team bracket with an Egg Bowl victory. Continuing hypotheticals here, Oregon beating Washington on the road would assure the Ducks are ahead of Ole Miss in the final rankings and the Rebels could move further down the top 10 if Alabama upends Auburn and then beats Texas A&M in the SEC Championship Game. We project the final seed for a first-round home game to come down to Notre Dame (10-2) and Ole Miss (11-1).\n            ",

The Hurricanes and Wolverines are the only squads within that group still in contention for an auto-bid as potential conference champions, albeit slim.None of these aforementioned top-20 teams control their own destiny and need the chaos route to unfold to be in the mix. During a season of parity, however, who's to say that doesn't happen this week?Texas hosts unbeaten SEC frontrunner No. 3 Texas A&M on Friday night, while No. 1 Ohio State vs. No. 15 Michigan and No. 11 Miami vs. No. 22 Pittsburgh kick off at noon ET Saturday, giving way to No. 14 Vanderbilt vs. No. 19 Tennessee in the afternoon. By Saturday evening, we'll know how many of these bubbles have burst and where things stand in the playoff conversation.Let's get into best-case scenarios and paths for teams on the bubble to make the playoff.\n\n    \n                                        \n    MiamiUnlike at-large hopefuls Vanderbilt or Texas, the Hurricanes can still get to their conference championship game with a shot at a potential auto-bid, but they're going to need assistance this weekend.A win over Pittsburgh coupled with losses by Virginia (to Virginia Tech) and SMU (to California) clinches an appearance in the ACC title game. Then, a win in that one on Dec. 6 would push Miami to, at worst, the No. 11 seed in the final bracket.If the unlikely ACC Championship Game scenario does not come to fruition for the Hurricanes, a win over Pittsburgh coupled with three losses from the following grouping -- Oklahoma (to LSU), Notre Dame (at Stanford), Alabama (at Auburn), BYU (to UCF), Utah (at Kansas) -- would be enough to warrant an at-large berth. This is where the head-to-head win over the Fighting Irish, for the first time this season, could come into play.If Miami fails to win the ACC, the Hurricanes need to get to No. 10 in the final rankings to garner the \"last team in\" designation and there's currently three teams ahead of them for that -- realistically five if you consider the No. 11 and No. 12 seeds as placeholders for the ACC and Group of Six champions.\n    \n                                        \n    VanderbiltAs terrific as Diego Pavia and the Commodores have been this season, the road losses to Alabama and Texas will likely keep them out of the playoff unless there's chaos involving the handful of teams ahead of them on the bubble.If Vanderbilt squashes Tennessee and adds another ranked win to its season total, they would need losses from Utah, Alabama and BYU to have a legitimate shot at appearing toward the front end of the \"last team in\" conversation. Like Miami, Vanderbilt needs to get to No. 10 in the rankings to reach the bracket since the Nos. 11 and 12 are going to conference champions. It would boost Vanderbilt's chances if Miami beats Pitt and somehow reaches the ACC Championship Game and wins.We don't think it would happen, but there's a chance the committee would rank Texas higher than Vanderbilt should both win this weekend despite the Longhorns finishing 9-3 and the Commodores 10-2. That's due to Texas beating Vanderbilt earlier this month and holding a 24-point lead in the contest entering the fourth quarter.\n    \n                                        \n    TexasAnyone think Texas regrets scheduling Ohio State this season? That opening loss coupled with the road gaffe at Florida is why the Longhorns are on the outside looking in with no real path to reach the bracket. As the preseason No. 1, missing out on a 12-team playoff following consecutive semifinals appearances is a bitter pill to swallow on the Forty Acres.\nIf Texas beats Texas A&M and disrupts the SEC Championship Game picture this weekend, Steve Sarkisian will improve his record with the Longhorns to 2-5 against top-6 opponents. That'll provide the committee with another data point involving Texas -- a third ranked win -- but it's likely not enough after the 25-point loss at Georgia this month tanked the Longhorns' stock in the top 25.If Texas beats Texas A&M, Tennessee beats Vanderbilt, Auburn beats Alabama, Pitt beats Miami, Kansas beats Utah and UCF beats BYU, there's a chance to get the No. 10 seed. The rest of rivalry weekend would need to go chalk, but a Stanford win over Notre Dame would help, too. Unfortunately, there's not going to be a three-loss team in the playoff this season unless Alabama beats Auburn then loses the SEC Championship Game.\n    \n                                        \n    MichiganA win this weekend over the top-ranked and unbeaten Buckeyes would be college football's single-most impressive feat of the season and would give the committee something to chew on when stacked against other potential 10-2 finishers, namely Oklahoma, Notre Dame, Utah, Miami and others.A win over Ohio State coupled with an Oregon loss at Washington put the Wolverines in the Big Ten Championship Game and represents a bid-stealing opportunity of sorts for what we project will be a fifth SEC team. If Michigan fails to play for a Big Ten title but beats the Buckeyes, that's going to hold serious weight during the committee's final meeting. Michigan's lone losses came to ranked Oklahoma and USC on the road, but the Wolverines would need to jump more than a half-dozen spots in the at-large conversation to get into the bracket. We think they would with a win over Ohio State.Oklahoma's the only team in the at-large grouping the Wolverines could not pass with a win over Ohio State if the Sooners beat LSU this weekend by virtue of a head-to-head result from September. That leaves Notre Dame, Alabama, Utah, BYU, Ole Miss, Utah and Vanderbilt as the teams Michigan would be compared to -- and potentially leap. Losses by several of those teams this weekend would certainly help Michigan's case and make it easier on the committee.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        There were no changes within the top five of this week's College Football Playoff Rankings, but there was still notable movement. Oregon climbed one spot to No. 5 after its statement win against USC. That pushed Ole Miss down to No. 6 despite the Rebels maintaining a strong résumé.Further down the list, Miami rose to No. 12, keeping its postseason hopes alive. However, that still leaves the Hurricanes on the outside looking in for an at-large bid, meaning their most realistic path to the playoff likely requires winning the ACC Championship Game, even though the chances of getting to Charlotte are slim. Meanwhile, Utah slipped to No. 13 following a narrow escape against Kansas State -- a game in which the Utes surrendered a staggering 472 rushing yards, raising concerns for the selection committee despite the victory.At the top, nothing has changed regarding the four programs currently projected to earn first-round byes in the new 12-team playoff format: No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Indiana, No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 4 Georgia remain firmly in place.This bracket is a projection heading into Week 14. Here is a look at how the College Football Playoff bracket looks after the fourth CFP Rankings release. \n\n                                                                    CBS Sports design\n                                                            There are still two more sets of CFP Rankings to come: next Tuesday's release ahead of conference championship week, followed by the final Top 25 and official 12-team playoff bracket, which will be unveiled on Sunday, Dec. 7.Who will represent the ACC?Although Miami is the highest-ranked ACC team in the eyes of the selection committee, plenty must break the Hurricanes' way for them to even reach the conference championship game. They would then have to win it to claim the league's automatic bid. As it stands, both SMU and Virginia control their own destiny entering the final week of the regular season. If they hold serve, they'll meet in Charlotte, with the winner expected to move into the projected No. 11 seed.For Miami to have a real shot at reaching the title game, it needs outside help. In the ACC race, the Hurricanes are rooting for at least two of the following three teams to take a loss before the dust settles: Duke, SMU and Virginia. Only then would a path open for Miami to claim the league's automatic berth.\nStill, by jumping ahead of Utah in the latest rankings, Miami has moved closer to at-large contention. But chaos elsewhere remains essential -- scenarios such as Alabama losing to Auburn in the Iron Bowl, Ole Miss falling to Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl or an LSU upset of Oklahoma. Even one of those may not be enough, especially with BYU sitting at No. 11 and positioned to grab the final at-large spot.Ole Miss in danger of losing first-round home gameWith Ole Miss slipping to No. 7 in the latest rankings, the program now sits uncomfortably close to falling out of the No. 5-8 range needed to host a first-round College Football Playoff game. A loss in the Egg Bowl to Mississippi State -- or movement around them in the rankings -- could easily push Ole Miss into road-game territory for the opening round.What complicates everything is the uncertainty surrounding Lane Kiffin. His future has become the most talked-about storyline of the season, as he remains linked to both LSU and Florida in what has become a high-stakes coaching pursuit. Kiffin has dodged questions publicly, but the situation has turned into a full-blown saga.\nThat instability matters. The selection committee has historically taken late-season uncertainty into account -- just ask Florida State in 2023. With the Egg Bowl looming, Ole Miss has little margin for error. A misstep on the field or further off-field distractions could not only cost the program a coveted first-round home game but, in a worst-case scenario, even jeopardize its spot in the 12-team playoff altogether.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A college football program accustomed to losing hit a new low on Tuesday.Massachusetts completed its worst season in program history with a 45-14 loss to Bowling Green to finish 0-12 on the year. The Minutemen became the 23rd FBS program since the turn of the century (excluding the shortened 2020 COVID season) to finish the year winless. Tuesday's loss sealed the sixth winless season in program history -- but the previous five featured schedules with eight games or fewer. According to CBS Sports research, UMass went 0-4 in 2020, 0-7-1 in 1927, 0-4-1 in 1896, 0-2 in 1882 and 0-1-1 in 1880. The Minutemen posted five 1-11 seasons since beginning FBS play in 2012, but had never gone 0-12 before 2025. With UMass finishing this season without a win, it marked the second consecutive year that a MAC program finished 0-12. Kent State endured the same misery just last season. Excluding 2020, the last time different teams from an FBS conference went winless in consecutive seasons happened in the late 1990s and also involved the MAC. Northern Illinois finished 0-11 in 1997, Kent State went 0-11 in 1998 and Ball State and Buffalo both went 0-11 in 1999.UMass, in its first season under coach Joe Harasymiak, began the season with a 42-10 loss to Temple before losing its next game in heartbreaking fashion. UMass led by as many as 17 points against Bryant, an FCS program, before squandering a late lead. Bryant kicked a 25-yard field goal with no time remaining to seal a shocking 27-26 comeback win.\nWinless FBS seasons since 2010YearTeamRecord2025UMass0–122024Kent State0–122019Akron0–122017UTEP0–122015UCF0–122015Kansas0–122013Miami (OH)0–122013Georgia State0–122012Southern Miss0–12That game was the closest loss UMass had all season. In total, 10 of UMass' 12 losses were by double-digits. Eight of those losses were by at least 20 points and the team's average margin of defeat was 27.2 points. UMass also had a chance to secure its first win against Buffalo. After intercepting a pass while leading 21-20 with just over a minute remaining in regulation, UMass was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct, which moved the ball back to its own 10-yard line. Buffalo forced a punt and scored a go-ahead touchdown with 19 seconds remaining to seal a 28-21 win.This season was full of change for UMass. This marked the program's second stint as a member of the MAC after spending the previous nine seasons operating as an FBS independent. The Minutemen fired former coach Don Brown after he went 6-28 and replaced him with Harasymiak, who spent the previous three seasons as the defensive coordinator at Rutgers and had a 20-15 record in three seasons as the head coach at Maine from 2016-18.Heading into the offseason, UMass will have to retool its roster to avoid another disastrous season. Since leaving the MAC the first time back in 2016, the Minutemen have won at least four games only twice. The last season with four wins was in 2018, which marked the final year of Mark Whipple's tenure at the school.\nUMass has the No. 103-ranked 2026 recruiting class in the 247Sports rankings heading into the week before the calendar flips to December. The Minutemen currently have 16 commitments in that class after finishing the 2025 recruiting cycle ranked No. 118 in the team recruiting rankings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The fourth edition of the College Football Playoff Rankings was released Tuesday night with undefeated Ohio State maintaining its grip on the No. 1 spot ahead of Indiana for the third straight week. While the top of the playoff field held firm, there is no telling what upsets may be in store for the top teams in the nation with Rivalry Week and conference championships ahead over the next 11 days.Past the Buckeyes and Hoosiers, Texas A&M and Georgia remained in the top four, which would guarantee those programs first-round byes.The most notable decisions from the penultimate week of the regular season were Oklahoma beating Missouri and Oregon rolling past USC in the lone matchups between top 25 opponents. While the Sooners held their No. 9 position, the Ducks jumped Ole Miss to become the new No. 6 team in the CFP Rankings.The reigning national champion Buckeyes are seeking their seventh playoff appearance in 12 years of the postseason bracket's existence (2014, 2016, 2019-20, 2022, 2024). Ohio State's final game against a ranked opponent comes in its regular-season finale against Michigan.\nEight of the 11 teams ranked No. 1 in a season's initial CFP Rankings ultimately reached the playoff, an effort now made easier with the expanded 12-team field, which is being contested for a second season.Currently projected to meet OSU in the Big Ten Championship Game is Indiana. The Buckeyes demolished Rutgers, 42-9, with Michigan -- jumping Texas while moving up three spots -- awaiting. The Hoosiers enjoyed a late off week with Big Ten basement dweller Purdue ahead in Week 14.Miami (FL), despite being ranked No. 12, takes the 11th projected bid from the CFP Selection Committee as the highest-rated team from the ACC. However, with the Hurricanes unlikely to play in the ACC Championship Game -- projected as SMU vs. Virginia -- they will likely need to earn a spot as an at-large team.\nTulane claims the last of the 12 committee-projected playoff spots as the highest-ranked Group of Five team in Tuesday's release at No. 24. With the 12-team playoff model granting automatic bids to the five highest-ranked conference champions, the Green Wave are presently expected to win the American and grab the final spot in the field. Should a Group of Five team not make the final rankings, the CFP Selection Committee would choose which champion deserved the last bid.    College Football Playoff Rankings, Nov. 25* First-round bye | ~ First-round host | ^ Highest-ranked Group of Five teamOhio State (11-0) *Indiana (11-0) *Texas A&M (11-0) *Georgia (10-1) *Texas Tech (10-1) ~Oregon (10-1) ~ Ole Miss (10-1) ~Oklahoma (9-2) ~Notre Dame (9-2)Alabama (9-2)BYU (10-1)Miami (FL) (9-2) | No. 11 seedUtah (9-2)Vanderbilt (9-2)Michigan (9-2)Texas (8-3)USC (8-3)Virginia (9-2)Tennessee (8-3)Arizona State (8-3)SMU (8-3)Pittsburgh (8-3)Georgia Tech (9-2)Tulane (9-2) ^ | No. 12 seedArizona (8-3)Committee shows hand a bitThe top 12 could've remained unchanged from the previous week with no losses by a team in that range over the weekend; however, the committee made a pair of significant changes as Oregon pushed ahead of Ole Miss at No. 6 and Miami moved to No. 12 ahead of Utah. Now, the Rebels are in danger of losing the opportunity at a first-round home game if they fall two more spots by the final vote. The Lane Kiffin questions will come into play in next week's rankings, too. If Oregon beats Washington to close at 11-1, the Ducks will be ahead of Ole Miss in the final bracket regardless of the coaching situation; that would give Oregon two wins over quality opponents in November alone, while the Rebels would have played South Carolina, The Citadel, Florida and Mississippi State -- teams that are a combined 16-29 overall.Thanksgiving table set for chaosSince the playoff era began in 2014, never has rivalry weekend included this many matchups with significant implications both in conference championship races and the postseason discussion. In fact, there's still a dozen teams outside of the committee's current top 10 vying for a spot in the bracket, according to our estimation within the at-large conversation or a potential auto-bid qualification -- BYU, Utah, Miami, Vanderbilt, Texas, Michigan, Virginia, Tulane, North Texas, Navy, SMU and Pitt. Friday and Saturday is a viewer's paradise thanks to a litany of scenarios for those still in the discussion, which is why the decision was made a couple years ago to invite more teams to the dance. \nThe most chaotic scenario possible would be Michigan taking out Ohio State, Texas upending Texas A&M, unranked Duke reaching the ACC title game thanks to a chain reaction of needed results and unexpected losses as heavy favorites by BYU, Utah and Notre Dame. That would be absolute mayhem for the committee to try and solve entering conference championship weekend.Pressure's on AlabamaIf the Crimson Tide lose at Auburn this weekend, there's no playoff trip for the second straight season at Alabama. A win locks in an appearance in the SEC Championship Game, where Kalen DeBoer's team would play Texas A&M or Georgia and likely be a betting underdog against each. If Alabama were to lose in Atlanta and finish 10-3, we're still projecting a playoff appearance as the \"last team in\" at No. 10, but there's certainly going to be argumentative points made by a potential 11-win BYU as a Big 12 title game loser, 10-win Miami and others.If the committee were to keep the Crimson Tide out of the bracket after a potential loss in the league title game, the entire second week of December nationally would be spent on playoff expansion speculation and why the SEC was jobbed in the final rankings for a fifth bid. League championship games matter most in auto-bid situations, but if playing in them becomes potentially detrimental to a playoff hopeful's resume in a 12-team bracket, their days are likely numbered.\nThere's precedent here in the expansion era and past playoffs. Last season, SMU lost in the ACC Championship Game to Clemsonvbut was picked as the final at-large selection. The Tigers were a bid-stealer of sorts, keeping a couple other two-loss hopefuls out of the mix. In 2022, unbeaten and third-ranked TCU lost the Big 12 Championship Game to Kansas State but still made the playoff. Over the course of the four-team era over a 10-year stretch, there were five teams who lost in a Power conference title game and missed the bracket as result -- 2023 Georgia, 2019 Georgia, 2018 Georgia, 2017 Auburn and 2015 Iowa. Alabama would become the first in a 12-team bracket if it beats Auburn, loses in Atlanta and gets skipped over by the committee. Committee believes in TulaneFor the second straight week, Tulane is the Group of Five's only ranked team. The Green Wave will play in the American Championship Game against North Texas or Navy with a win over Charlotte on Saturday. James Madison is a neat story, but Louisville's late-season tank has damaged the Dukes' already weak strength of schedule, and it's clear they're not on the committee's radar. Had JMU beaten the Cardinals in September, it would likely be inside the top 20 right now with a real shot as the Sun Belt's projected champion. North Texas remains our projected Group of Five playoff representative at CBS Sports. With Drew Mestemaker at quarterback, we expect the Mean Green to beat Temple, take out Tulane for a conference title and play at fifth-seeded Texas Tech in the opening round.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Twenty years ago, Mike Gundy took over Oklahoma State and built one of the most electric programs in the sport. For years, Gundy's teams were defined by dynamic quarterback play and high-flying receivers. During the descent that ended his career, Gundy lost his way. The greatest coach in program history was fired on Sept. 23 in the midst of an 11-game losing streak against FBS opponents. In his final two games, Oklahoma State scored 15 points. By hiring Eric Morris, the Cowboys have found the perfect successor to bring the program back. Morris, the coach at North Texas, was named the next coach at Oklahoma State on Tuesday. He will reportedly stay with the Mean Green through a potential College Football Playoff appearance after leading them to a historic 10-1 campaign. \nMorris's offensive innovation echoes the best of the Gundy era. He's won at multiple levels despite facing resource disadvantages. This year, he has the Mean Green at the top of the competitive American Conference. And based on his track record, Morris has a case as the best pound-for-pound quarterback developer in college football. Early in his career, Morris worked under fellow Texas Tech legend Kliff Kingsbury in Lubbock, including a five-year stint as Patrick Mahomes' offensive coordinator. As a coach at tiny FCS Incarnate Word, Morris led the Cardinals to a conference championship in his first year. Then, he discovered Cameron Ward -- a future No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft -- as a zero-star out of a run-based high school offense. In recent years, Morris identified John Mateer as a little-known recruit out of DFW. He helped reboot Chandler Morris's career and earn him a major offer from Virginia. Drew Mestermaker is his newest success story, and maybe his greatest. \n\n        \n            \n                Meet Drew Mestemaker: North Texas QB enjoying breakout after never starting varsity game in high school\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe redshirt freshman had never been a full-time starter since freshman year of high school, but Morris brought him in as a preferred walk-on. Now, he leads the nation in passing with 3,469 yards, 26 touchdowns and four interceptions on 9.7 yards per attempt. Mestermaker was already poised to become one of the hottest names in the transfer portal. Now, after his massive breakout season, Oklahoma State will get the first crack. And by the way, Mestermaker isn't the only player with Power Four upside that Morris can bring with him to Stillwater. True freshman running back Caleb Hawkins has already rushed for 1,030 yards and 19 touchdowns; he's from Shawnee, Oklahoma. Receivers Wyatt Young and Miles Coleman have multiple years of eligibility remaining. On an Oklahoma State roster with plenty of holes, having an offense to import brings plenty of excitement. \nOklahoma State has not produced an NFL draft pick at receiver since Tylan Wallace in 2021. They haven't produced a drafted quarterback since Mason Rudolph in 2018. The Cowboys are dead last in the Big 12 in offense, and haven't even been top half in the league since 2020. Against FBS opponents in 2025, North Texas leads the nation in points per drive (3.88) and yards per play (7.4). They're top-five in success rate (55.1%), yards per pass (9.6) and explosive play rate (16.6%). Fireworks are coming back to Boone Pickens Stadium. However, there's one thing that really sets Morris apart -- his ability to do more with less. Across his coaching career, Morris has never spent time at an advantaged program. North Texas ranks among the lowest in the American in revenue sharing, and UIW is one of the lowest-funded programs in the FCS. Yet, he still won. \nAt Oklahoma State, he will feel something brand new: an advantage. The Cowboys are fully funding revenue sharing and will enter the market as buyers. The facilities and stadium are strong. Pairing those resources with his Texas ties should immediately overhaul recruiting. North Texas general manager Raj Murti has already emerged as a star for building a championship-level roster on a shoestring budget.There are still complications. The Big 12 is littered with offensive-minded coaches who never figured out the defensive side. First-year defensive coordinator Skyler Casity has stabilized the unit at UNT, but Morris faces difficult decisions there. Additionally, the Big 12 is uniquely equipped to defend the Air Raid after decades of exposure dating back to Mike Leach. Morris will have to find the next wrinkle. But across stops, he has always found a way.Eighteen years ago, Gundy became a national star when he beat his chest and delivered the famous line: \"I'm a man, I'm 40.\" Now, at the same age, Morris arrives in Stillwater with a strong résumé and a clear-eyed view of the modern sport.\nNo one will ever replace Gundy, but Morris brings many of his greatest qualities, with a contemporary understanding of college football that can push Oklahoma State into the future.\n            ",

The Lions remain one game back of the Bears (yes, really) for first place in the NFC North, and they'll also have revenge on their minds for this game, as the Packers destroyed them back in Week 1. The game is part of a tough three-week stretch for the Lions, who play the Cowboys and Rams in the two games following this one.Green Bay also captured a win last week, improving to 7-3-1 with a comfortable victory over the Vikings. Green Bay has won back-to-back games since being somewhat embarrassed in games against the Panthers and Eagles a few weeks ago, and will surely be looking to lay the hammer down on the Lions here and knock them even further back in the division race. The Packers have their own chance to stake claim to the division down the stretch, with games against Detroit and Minnesota and two against Chicago.Will the Packers make it three wins in a row, or will the Lions finally stack back-to-back victories for the first time since early October? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.\nWhere to watch Lions vs. Packers liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Lions -2.5, O/U 48.5 via DraftKings SportsbookBet Packers vs. Lions and other NFL Week 13 games at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl or bust: Biggest reason why these 11 contenders will miss out on hoisting the Lombardi Trophy\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKey storylinesRevenge game. The Packers absolutely destroyed the Lions back in Week 1. Their defensive front totally dominated the game to the point that the Lions were essentially unable to function offensively. Micah Parsons played a limited role after sitting out for most of the offseason program prior to his trade to Green Bay, but he was phenomenal in his limited snaps. Players like Lukas Van Ness, Devonte Wyatt and more showed out, and the secondary was extremely sticky in coverage throughout the game. The Lions will surely want to prove that the game was an aberration, and they have shown throughout this season that they can still be as explosive as any team in the league when they are on their game.NFC North standings. Chicago has surged into first place in the division on the strength of a four-game winning streak, but both Green Bay and Detroit are right behind the Bears. Chicago sits at 8-3, but the Packers are 7-3-1 and the Lions are 7-4. The Packers currently own the tiebreaker over the Lions thanks to their head-to-head victory, but Detroit can even that up with a win. The Lions also own the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Bears, and don't play them again until the final week of the season. The Packers have yet to play against Chicago, and have two games coming up against the Bears in Weeks 14 and 16. This round robin of games will go a long way toward determining the NFC North champion.Injuries galore. Both teams are incredibly banged up coming into this game, with a spate of injuries affecting each team. Both teams will be without their star tight end, as Tucker Kraft and Sam LaPorta remain on injured reserve. And then on Monday's injury report, an incredible 31 players were listed. That includes Packers No. 1 cornerback Keisean Nixon, pass-rusher Lukas Van Ness and interior defensive lineman Karl Brooks, along with Lions center Graham Glasgow and safety Kerby Joseph, none of whom practiced in any capacity. (Joseph is not expected to play, per Dan Campbell.) The Packers could get back one or both of Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed, who each got in limited sessions on Monday, as did Matthew Golden. Marcus Davenport, meanwhile, could return for Detroit, but the Lions limited a whole bunch of other players (including most of their offensive line, along with Brian Branch and Terrion Arnold) on Monday as well. Thanksgiving history. This will be the 23rd all-time meeting between the Lions and Packers on Thanksgiving, the most such matchups in NFL history. (They played every year from 1951 through 1963.) The Lions are 12-9-1 in the Thanksgiving day series against Green Bay despite being just 38-45-2 all time. This will be Green Bay's 39th time playing on Thanksgiving overall, and the Packers are 16-20-2 in those contests. The last time these two teams played on Thanksgiving was actually two years ago, with the Packers winning 29-22.Prediction\nDetroit is a different team on the fast track at Ford Field than it is outdoors. That game back in Week 1 was a long time ago, and it was played at Lambeau Field. The Lions simply have more explosive playmakers on offense than do the Packers, and I therefore trust them to put up more points -- even against this Green Bay defense. \nPrediction: Lions 27, Packers 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Matt Norlander is on the Vegas Strip and bouncing back and forth between the two arenas hosting this year's Players Era Championship. He'll be providing frequent updates and insider information throughout each day of the event, so check back in regularly. You can read his Monday notebook here. LAS VEGAS — Among the many things the Players Era will give college hoops this week, some additional crystallization on which teams have the goods ranks near the top.And on Tuesday, we learned Tennessee is again one of the most physical and impressive defensive teams in the country. The biggest matchup of Day 2 played out at MGM Grand Garden Arena: No. 17 Tennessee 76, No. 3 Houston 73. The Vols atoned for their 19-point Elite Eight loss to the Cougars last season.Tennessee was able to rip the dub thanks to holding Houston scoreless over a seven-minute span in the second half while also gaining 10 points during UH's drought. \nThe game was as good of an environment as any through the first two days of Players Era. Tennessee got 22 points from Ja'Kobi Gillespie, who led an all-around inspiring effort for Rick Barnes' crew. It the definition of a grown man's game. \"These guys figured it out themselves, and they were very talkative, very active in the time-outs, and got some good play with our post guys,\" Barnes said. \"Just being with them and hearing them talk, coach each other, hearing them talk about adjustments that need to be made is a step in the right direction.\"\nKelvin Sampson couldn't hide his frustration afterward, however. Tennessee shot 29 free throws to Houston's 11. The Cougars typically control the conversation from a physicality standpoint, but the Volunteers unquestionably got the better of the Coogs on Tuesday night. The game was also a breakout one for Bishop Boswell, a 6-4 sophomore combo guard who was a key cog in helping Tennessee keep Houston just enough at bay over the final five minutes. Boswell finished with 10 points, four rebounds and three assists. His on-ball defense was a beacon for Tennessee overall.\"He's becoming one of the best defensive guards in the country and there's no doubt that it's a hard role to put a player to want to buy into, to want to do it, but he's all about team,\" Barnes said of Boswell. \"He wants to win more than anything else, and we knew during the whole recruiting process he was a winner and he would do whatever it would take. We're asking him to fill a major role and he's embraced it.\"\nISU's Otzelberger says Players Era about wins more than moneyThe Players Era Championship has caused more conversation, buzz, criticism and intrigue than anything else so far this season.Some of that is because it's got some obvious flaws. Let's address the biggest one right now. On Tuesday, No. 15 Iowa State beat Creighton with aplomb, 78-60. The Cyclones are 2-0 in the event after winning a riveting battle over No. 14 St. John's on Monday.\nBut in the immediate hours after this win, they had no idea when they'll play on Wednesday nor who their opponent will be. That's because Players Era's 18-team format isn't built upon a bracket. When you don't have bracket play AND you don't have all matchups predetermined, you're left to rely on game scores to settle the rest of the schedule. The primary tiebreaker is average margin of victory (with a cap of 20 points to avoid incentivizing teams heedlessly running up the score). Iowa State's average margin of victory after two games is 9.5. It won't be enough to qualify for Wednesday's championship game — and might not be good enough to even make the third-place game, because we could have five of the 18 teams go 2-0. If ISU's plus-19 point differential is fifth-best, the Cyclones won't play for any additional NIL money. \nThe event's abnormal format isn't lost on some fans who flew out here to take in hoops on the Strip. As final seconds died out Tuesday, an Iowa State backer sitting in Section 220 was shouting to ISU's Milan Momcilovic, \"YOU NEED TO MAX IT! SHOOT IT!\" He knew one more basket could be the difference between playing for first place or playing in the third-place game. Momcilovic opted not to shoot.I did a walk-and-talk with Cyclones coach TJ Otzelberger after the win to chat about the unusual (and criticized) tiebreaker scenarios in play. The situation on Tuesday was muddled all the more by the fact that Otzelberger says he owes his career to Creighton coach Greg McDermott, who gave him his first break in 2006 by bringing him on staff at Iowa State (when McDermott was in his first season coaching that program).\"Going into it, you know that point deferential is a part of this,\" Otzelberger told CBS Sports. \"The respect I have for Coach McDermott and his program, we're not going to put the game in position where we're trying to run up the score and get extra points late to win by a greater margin. To me, the relationship and the character of our program is more important than that. The easy solution would have been if we would have been up by [20], then it would have been fine, but that wasn't the case. We want to do the right thing.\"\n\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Players Era needs a bracket, not complicated tiebreakers to determine finalists\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPlayers Era's margin-of-victory rule has made it vulnerable to easy criticism. And that noise has also overshadowed a more important element of the entire experience: winning games. Players are already getting paid to play in this event, so the tiebreaker is really about who gets a chance at the most money. But, as Otzelberger told me, the more valuable thing for his team is the Quad 1 wins for the taking.\"You're here to win games, you're here to get better as a team and a program,\" Otzelberger said. \"The main thing is to come out and give it your best to win the game. And I understand there's other factors and variables that go into this event, but we're just gonna focus on being at our best to come out win the game.\" By the way, ISU won without starting point guard Tamin Lipsey, who sat due to a sore groin. His availability for Wednesday is questionable, Otzelberger said. \nThe Cyclones are off to their first 6-0 start since 2021-22 and averaging a sizzling 90.5 points. It's looking like a top-10 team in the country.Will it be enough to play for the championship on Wednesday? Sit tight. There could be as many as five 2-0 teams battling for two spots in the championship game. I'll update this story throughout the night with the latest as we learn more here in Vegas. St. John's bounces back strongFor as frustrating as Monday's 83-82 outcome was for St. John's, a good sign for Rick Pitino's team. The Red Storm handed Baylor its first loss of the season with a cruise-control 86-81 win. Both teams will find out their Wednesday opponents at the end of Tuesday night. \n\"I think what I enjoyed the most last night was the devastation in the eyes of our players,\" Pitino said. \"And you really know a team with class. I don't mean the way they act off the court, which they act great, but a class team really, really focuses in, doesn't hang their heads and brings it, and these guys did. I think for the first seven, eight minutes, we could have given the Knicks a game before losing by 40. So it was a brilliant first eight minutes of the game.\"Bryce Hopkins had 26 points and Oziyah Sellers added 22, providing the type of offensive firepower that Pitino and his staff were hoping to acquire in the portal. \"I haven't begged very often about players shooting the ball, but I begged these two guys to take more shots, and they did tonight. They were both brilliant,\" Pitino said. \nThe Big East has been rickety league-wide through the first three weeks of the season, and with Creighton starting 0-2 at Players Era, St. John's getting out of Vegas at 2-1 would be ideal to help offset the 18 total losses across the conference.2025 Players Era scores, scheduleMonday's scoresNo. 17 Tennessee 85, Rutgers 60RecapBaylor 81, Creighton 74 RecapKansas 71, Notre Dame 61RecapNo. 15 Iowa State 83, No. 14 St. John's 82RecapNo. 3 Houston 78, Syracuse 74 (OT)RecapNo. 21 Auburn 84, Oregon 73RecapNo. 12 Gonzaga 95, No. 8 Alabama 85RecapNo. 7 Michigan 94, San Diego State 54RecapMaryland 74, UNLV 67 RecapTuesday's scores, scheduleNotre Dame 68, Rutgers 63 RecapNo. 15 Iowa State 78, Creighton 60RecapKansas 71, Syracuse 60RecapNo. 14 St. John's 96, Baylor 81RecapNo. 17 Tennessee 76, No. 3 Houston 73RecapNo. 7 Michigan 102, No. 21 Auburn 72RecapNo. 13 Gonzaga vs. Maryland9:30 p.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden ArenaOregon vs. San Diego State11 p.m. (TNT) at Michelob Ultra ArenaUNLV vs. No. 8 Alabama12 a.m. (truTV) at Grand Garden ArenaWednesday's schedulePremiere Four (Field determined after Tuesday's games)Third-place game7 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaChampionship9:30 p.m. (TNT) at Grand Garden ArenaConsolation games, TBDThursday's scheduleConsolation games, TBD  \n            ",

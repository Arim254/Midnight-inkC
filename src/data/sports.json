It was reported that James was ramping up his workload to prepare for the Lakers' season opener against the Golden State Warriors on Oct. 21. However, his timeline to return has been pushed back, meaning he will miss his team's first game of the season for the first time in his 23-year career.\n        \n            \n                LeBron James injury ripple effects: Luka Dončić's MVP case gets stronger, Bronny in Lakers' rotation?\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIf James is indeed out until mid-November, it's possible he would miss the first 10-15 games of the season. The Lakers have a five-game road trip starting in Atlanta against the Hawks on Nov. 8 and don't play back in Los Angeles until Nov. 18 against the Utah Jazz. That game against the Hawks will be L.A.'s 10th game of the season.\nNotably, NBA awards such as MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA require players to play in at least 65 games. James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 70 games played during the 2024-25 season, en route to earning Second-Team All-NBA honors.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        NASCAR spotter Joe White shared Wednesday that he has been fired following a major accident involving Ty Dillon, the driver for whom he spotted, and Cup Series playoff contender William Byron late in Sunday's race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. White worked for Kaulig Racing as the spotter for their No. 10 Cup Series team as well as their No. 11 Xfinity Series team.With 31 laps to go in Sunday's opening race of the Round of 8 at Las Vegas, Dillon -- who had been running laps down with a car that he had been struggling with -- was called to pit road for a green flag stop just after the leaders finished their cycle of stops. Normally, there is an expectation for a team coming to pit road to alert traffic behind them that they are slowing down to come to pit road, whether it be by the spotter alerting the spotter for the car running behind them or by the driver delivering a hand signal to traffic behind them. This is especially true in cases where a lap down car is coming to pit road in front of lead lap cars.\nDillon was called to pit road just after being put a lap down by race leader Kyle Larson, and he began to slow in Turns 3 & 4 in order to make the entry to pit road a short distance ahead of William Byron, who just lost the lead and remained second. But apparently, Byron's team had not received a message from Dillon's team that they were going to pit: Byron had only been informed to expect Dillon to run in either the second or third lane, leaving him completely unaware that the No. 10 in front of him was coming to pit road.\nThe result was a violent collision that took both Dillon and Byron out of the race, and one which has severely hampered Byron's championship hopes. Prior to the crash, Byron had possessed a 23 point advantage over the cut line to make the Championship 4, and still had a chance of earning a spot in the final round outright by winning. Instead, and despite having led 55 laps, Byron left Las Vegas with a 36th place finish that has left him 15 points below the cut line. Byron will now have to either overcome his points deficit or win at either Talladega or Martinsville to advance to the final round of the playoffs and have a chance to win the Cup Series championship in the season finale at Phoenix.\n\"I never saw him wave. I didn't see any indication that he was  pitting, and it was probably 12 to 15 laps after we had pitted, so I  thought the cycle [of green flag stops] was fully over,\" Byron told USA upon exiting the infield care center.  \"Nobody said anything to my spotter from what I know. I had zero idea.  ... I was watching him thinking 'okay, he missed the bottom a little bit  here' and then he just started slowing, and I had no idea what was  going on.\"I'm just devastated. I had no indication, so I obviously wouldn't have just driven full speed into the back of him like that.\"\nOn Wednesday afternoon, White shared that he had been fired upon arriving in Talladega for this weekend's race and that he was heading to the airport to return home. While White had not been slated to return as Dillon's spotter in 2026, it was expected that he would remain with Kaulig prior to his mid-week dismissal.\nWith White no longer with the team, Frank Deiny Jr., who had been the spotter for Kaulig's No. 16 team and A.J. Allmendinger, will move over to the No. 10 team to be Dillon's spotter for the final three races of the season. Former NASCAR driver T.J. Bell will take over as spotter for Allmendinger and the No. 16 team.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Through six weeks of the NFL season, it's hard to find a team who doesn't have a serious question mark. Two weeks ago, we would've been raving about the undefeated Eagles and Bills. Now both teams have lost two straight games. How about Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, one of the preseason favorites? With Jackson having been out each of the last two weeks, Baltimore enters its bye week 1-5 and is in serious danger of missing the postseason. Even the three-time defending AFC champion Chiefs aren't immune. They sit 3-3 heading into a Week 7 home date with AFC rival Las Vegas, though Kansas City is the largest favorite of the week at -11.5.Which teams would you take today to make the Super Bowl?

The Eagles struggled mightily on defense last week, and it's uncertain if cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (hamstring) will be back this week. \"I think it's fair to call this game a must win for Philadelphia coming off two straight losses. We've already seen one Eastern Pennsylvania team fire a successful head coach (Penn State, James Franklin), and while I don't think Nick Sirianni's job is in imminent danger considering he most recently won the Super Bowl, a third straight loss will turn up the heat a bit. Coming off a bye week and with a brutal stretch ahead, this game might be a must win for Minnesota as well. This is the type of game where I would bet both sides +7.5 at something like -125 odds and prepare for a close game no matter who wins. My coin flip says Philly's misery continues for another week. Vikings 23, Eagles 21\". See his other Week 7 football score predictions at SportsLine.How to make Week 7 NFL score predictionsIn addition, Cohen is picking one game to fly over the projected total. You can see who it is at SportsLine, and use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for just $1.Who wins every Week 7 NFL game, and which game is a must bet for the over?

And again.\nGame 4 predictionToronto's offense woke up in Game 3 and they hit Luis Castillo hard twice during the regular season. Max Scherzer hasn't looked so hot himself lately.

For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football,' Patriots (-7) vs. Titans and Broncos (-7) vs. Giants.Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

    "body": "\n        Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy missed his entire rookie season due to a knee injury. He already missed three games this season due to an ankle injury.\"It's getting there. I wouldn't say it's 100 percent,\" McCarthy said.If it was up to McCarthy, who returned to practice on Monday and was a limited participant Wednesday, he would play when the Vikings (3-2) host the Philadelphia Eagles (4-2) on Sunday.\"We've got to be smart and understand there's a lot of things that go on. I'm just going to do what I'm told and try to get better,\" McCarthy said.\nThe Eagles, who are on a two-game losing streak, would go up against Carson Wentz if McCarthy can't play. Wentz, who the Eagles picked No. 2 overall in the 2016 draft, started in place of McCarthy the last three weeks. Both McCarthy and Wentz, who was a full participant practice while nursing a sore shoulder, can expect plenty of work in practice. \"I'm having a blast coaching [McCarthy],\" coach Kevin O'Connell said. \"It started last week, when he was able to really start ramping up a little bit. That 1-on-1 work, and then obviously the work he does with [quarterback coaches Josh McCown and Jordan Traylor] is going to be critical.\"O'Connell previously said McCarthy would need to practice for a full week before he gets clearance to play. In three games, Wentz leads Minnesota in passing with a 69% completion rate, 759 yards, five touchdowns and two interceptions. McCarthy's two appearances feature a 58.5% passing clip, 301 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions.\n\"I think the big thing is just getting him back on the grass, in uniform, practicing, getting real live reps of a pass rush and taking drops and applying some of the things that he's worked really hard on as of late, as he's kind of gotten to that phase of his rehab,\" O'Connell said.\n            ",

Tagogvailoa said that, while those comments were well-intended, he realizes now that it created an unneeded distraction for a Dolphins team that enters this Sunday's game against the Browns with a 1-5 record. \"I made a mistake, and I'm owning up to that right now,\" Tagovailoa said. The Dolphins' former Pro Bowl quarterback said that he has spoken to the team's other leaders about his comments while adding that they \"know that my intent was right.\" \n\"The intent can be right,\" he said, \"but when things get misconstrued or however the media wants to portray it, that leaves a void of silence and a lot of questions for the guys on our team now.\" In addition to adding to the outside noise, Tagovailoa also acknowledged that he didn't protect the locker room by airing the team's business publicly. \"I felt like I let the emotions of the game get to me after the game,\" he said. \"That's something that I can learn from as a leader on this team. What happens in-house should be protected, and none of that should have gotten out. And so want to publicly apologize about that. Want to move forward and focus on the Cleveland Browns.\" \nAs Tagovailoa surely knows, winning can cure a lot of things for a struggling team. Fortunately for the Dolphins, their next opponent has also won just one game and has had a similarly tumultuous start to the 2025 season. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Jets are in free fall, off to an 0-6 under first-year coach Aaron Glenn.New York's 2025 0-6 start is just the third such winless beginning to a season in team history along with the 1996 season (0-7) and the 2020 season (0-13). The Jets will certainly be in the midst of a rebuild next offseason or two, which puts the future of talented, 24-year-old running back Breece Hall up in the air. The 2022 second-round pick is set to become a free agent next offseason, and the team drafted promising Wisconsin running back Braelon Allen in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL Draft a year ago. New York is projected to have the seventh-most effective cap space ($58.2 million) in the NFL next offseason, according to OverTheCap.com, but there's a decent chance the franchise won't prioritize that money on a running back next year with plenty of other holes to address. That's why it would make sense for the Jets to at least shop Hall around to see what they could get for the talented, well-rounded back. Which teams would make the most sense for Hall? Here is a look at five possible landing spots for the young running back ahead of the NFL's Nov. 4 trade deadline.\n\n        \n            \n                Alvin Kamara to Chiefs? New WR for Giants' Jaxson Dart? 10 NFL trades that should happen before 2025 deadline\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kansas City ChiefsThe Chiefs could use more juice on offense, including an upgrade at running back since quarterback Patrick Mahomes is currently Kansas City's leading rusher with 222 yards this season. Isiah Pacheco has rushed for under 55 yards in every game this season, and he's gone 12 consecutive games without a rushing touchdown. He's second on the team in rushing with 214 yards this season. New York would certainly be happy to absorb as many draft picks as it can get amid a rebuild, and the Chiefs are obviously in win-now mode. Following an encouraging 30-17 victory over the Detroit Lions on \"Sunday Night Football\" in Week 6, this is a deal that Kansas City should look to make.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersThe Chargers offense is as beaten down with injuries as it gets with offensive tackle Rashawn Slater (torn patellar tendon, out for the season), offensive tackle Joe Alt (ankle), running back Omarion Hampton (ankle, on injured reserve) and wide receiver Derius Davis (knee) all wounded. Quarterback Justin Herbert could use some assistance, especially a reliable checkdown release valve out of the backfield given his ragged offensive line.\nHall could aid Herbert and the Chargers both in the ground game and through the air. Hall's 150 catches and 1,224 yards receiving since 2023 are both the second most in the entire NFL among running backs in that span while his seven receiving touchdowns in that time are tied for the fifth most at the position with Saquon Barkley. Los Angeles needs to inquire about Hall, especially since Hampton is on a rookie deal. Plus, he could be a nice mentor for their first-round rookie back.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers are all in on the 2025 season after signing 41-year-old quarterback Aaron Rodgers, signing 34-year-old cornerback Darius Slay, trading for soon-to-be 31-year-old cornerback Jalen Ramsey and trading for 30-year-old tight end Jonnu Smith. This is a team in win-now mode, and that approach is working for Pittsburgh thus far with the Steelers out to a 4-1 start and in first place in the AFC North. \nHowever, the Steelers currently have the fourth-worst run game in football, averaging just 84.0 yards rushing per game through six weeks. That's surprising considering Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Arthur Smith can typically scheme up a capable run game no matter who is in the backfield. Perhaps he and the Steelers are missing the between-the-tackles consistency Najee Harris provided them the prior four seasons when he went for over 1,000 yards each year from 2021 to 2024. Hall could complement the speedier Jaylen Warren to beef up the Pittsburgh rushing attack. Plus, the Steelers also have an extra third-round pick for 2026 thanks to trading wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys in the offseason. Not necessarily saying a third-round pick is the right price for a rental running back, but the Jets would likely be interested in that offer.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsThe Arizona Cardinals are off to a tough 2-4 start to the 2025 season, but their record is somewhat deceiving. All six of their games have been decided by seven points or fewer this season: they won their first two and are currently on a four-game losing streak. Pro Bowl starting running back James Conner suffered a season-ending ankle injury and 2024 third-round pick Trey Benson is now on injured reserve with a knee injury. \nThe Cardinals don't have much time to right the ship. If they want to get their run game back on track and potentially give Hall an extended tryout to be a part of their future plans, the trade makes sense given he is only 24 years old. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston TexansThe Houston Texans are 2-3 this season, but it's not their defense's fault. Coach DeMeco Ryans' unit is the NFL's No. 1 scoring defense, allowing just 12.2 points per game. That's the fewest points per game allowed by a team with a losing record through five games in the Super Bowl era (since 1966), per CBS Sports Research. On the other hand, Houston's offense is averaging just 21.6 points per game, 22nd in the league this season. They've been league average on the ground, averaging 116.2 rushing yards per game this year. Their offense sorely lacks juice with just 31 explosive plays this season, tied for the fifth-fewest in the NFL, per TruMedia. The Texans' nine explosive runs are tied for the seventh-fewest in the league in 2025. Quarterback C.J. Stroud is still on his rookie deal, and with Joe Mixon out and Nick Chubb not looking the same after multiple, serious knee injuries throughout his career, Houston should pursue Hall in an attempt to salvage its season. \n            ",

Both teams pulled off two consecutive road wins to open the LCS round of the 2025 MLB playoffs.In the ALCS, the Toronto Blue Jays hitters finally showed some life as the offense powered the team to a 13-4 blowout Game 3 win Wednesday night as the series moved to Seattle. They'll look to continue that momentum into Game 4.The Dodgers are up 2-0 against the Milwaukee Brewers after Yoshinobu Yamamoto threw a complete game gem in Tuesday's Game 2 win. The Dodgers, now 7-1 in the playoffs, allowed just two runs to the Brewers in the first two games of the NLCS.The Mariners punched their ticket to their first ALCS since 2001 last week by eliminating the Tigers in 15 innings in a winner-take-all ALDS Game 5. The Blue Jays knocked out the Yankees in the ALDS. The Dodgers, meanwhile, took out the Phillies in four games in the NLDS, and the Brewers got past the Cubs in five games.\nThe LCS round could wrap up as early as this weekend, and the 2025 World Series begins on Oct. 24.

    "body": "\n        In case anyone needed a reminder, Aaron Rodgers—the 41-year-old Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, vet of 21 seasons, four-time NFL MVP and future Hall of Famer—attended his press conference after the Steelers' 23-9 win over the Browns on Sunday while wearing a black baseball cap with the following words emblazoned on the side: NOT MY FIRST RODEO.So when he was asked about whether he believed his team is trending toward being a contender in the AFC, Rodgers' words carried extra weight.You can bet Bengals vs. Steelers at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\"Well, that's where we want to be, and we're putting ourselves into position to start entering the conversation,\" he said. \"But a lot can happen.\"SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and Projection Model agree with Rodgers that it's time to start taking Pittsburgh seriously in the AFC. The Steelers (4-1) already lead the AFC North by 2.5 games over the Cincinnati Bengals (2-4) and can increase their lead with a victory over the Bengals on Thursday night at Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati. The injury-ravaged Ravens and Browns sit at the bottom of the division at 1-5 each.According to the projection model, no team in the AFC has a better chance to win its division than the Steelers (87.8%). Only the Buccaneers of the NFC South have a better chance in the entire league, at 93.5%. Only the Bills (22.4%) have a better chance of winning the AFC than Pittsburgh (16.5%) according to the model. The numbers are more remarkable when you consider the model projects the Steelers to finish with just the third-best record in the conference behind both Colts (5-1) and Bills (4-2). AFC teamProjected winsWin divisionReach playoffsWin AFCWin Super BowlColts11.471.1%93.2%15.3%6.3%Bills11.268.1%91.7%22.4%11.7%Steelers10.787.8%92.5%16.5%7.4%Broncos10.737.5%81.8%12.9%6.7%Chiefs10.334.4%76.4%15.7%8.7%Patriots9.831.6%65.5%3.1%0.9%Chargers9.828.0%70.7%5.9%2.5%Jaguars9.419.6%56.7%2.7%1.0%Texans8.79.3%44.3%3.8%1.8%So for the Thursday Night Football game against Cincinnati, keeping pace with Buffalo and Indianapolis will be what's on the line for Rodgers &. Co. The Bills have an easier remaining strength of scheduled than Pittsburgh down the stretch, while the Colts have the advantage of an extra win and a bye week remaining over the Steelers.Pittsburgh enters Thursday's game on a three-game winning streak, while the Bengals have dropped four in a row since losing starting quarterback Joe Burrow indefinitely due to a turf toe injury. Defense has led the Steelers during their hot stretch. Over the last three games, they have allowed just 14.7 points per game while forcing seven turnovers and registering 17 sacks. Pittsburgh has sacked the quarterback at least five times in three straight games and in Sunday's win over Cleveland, the Steelers hit Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel 16 times, the second most by any NFL team in a game this season.The defense has forced 10 turnovers this year, which is tied for third most in the NFL. That's bad news for a Cincinnati team that has turned the ball over 11 times, which is tied for the most in the league.The Steelers are 5.5-point favorites over the Bengals.\nBut Thursday games on the road haven't been friendly to Pittsburgh. The Steelers have lost eight of their last nine Thursday road games under coach Mike Tomlin, including four in row. Given the roll Pittsburgh is on, that trend seems to be in jeopardy.\"Thursday is all about the league and making money, and we understand that,\" Rodgers said. \"It used to be just Thanksgiving Thursdays, and they added obviously Thursday games. And then Amazon coming in with a nice chunk of change. So we know what it's all about. But it's the same; everybody's got at least one of these, so we just suck it up. We go on the road and take care of business, and we get a little break.\"No one would know better than Rodgers.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Seattle Mariners look to move within one victory of the first World Series appearance in franchise history when they host the Toronto Blue Jays at T-Mobile Park on Wednesday for Game 3 of the 2025 American League Championship Series. Seattle, which entered the AL as an expansion team along with Toronto in 1977, is the only current MLB team that has yet to play for the Commissioner's Trophy.After winning a 15-inning classic to get past the Detroit Tigers in five games in the AL Division Series, the Mariners went into Toronto and posted 3-1 and 10-3 victories over the top-seeded Blue Jays to take a 2-0 lead in the ALCS. Seattle sends George Kirby to the mound in Game 3, while Toronto counters with Shane Bieber.Four games are on Wednesday's NHL schedule, including an Atlantic Division showdown that sees the Detroit Red Wings hosting the two-time reigning Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. The Red Wings (2-1-0) are seeking their third consecutive victory after sweeping a home-and-home series with the Toronto Maple Leafs, while the Panthers (3-1-0) look to bounce back from their first loss of the 2025-26 season -- a 5-2 road setback against the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday.Meanwhile, Week 8 of the 2025 college football season continues with a pair of Conference USA matchups, one of which has UTEP (1-5, 0-2) facing Sam Houston (0-6, 0-3) at Shell Energy Stadium in Houston on the CBS Sports Network.The Mariners are -130 betting favorites (wager $130 to win $100), while the Blue Jays are priced at +109 (wager $100 to win $109) in the latest MLB betting odds for Blue Jays vs. Mariners. The Panthers are -142 favorites versus the Red Wings, and UTEP is favored by 3 points in its showdown with Sam Houston.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on for Wednesday, Oct. 15. All times EasternMLB best bets, where to watchBlue Jays at MarinersTime: 8:08 p.m. | Location: Seattle | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 7 (-123) | Expert: Mariners -130 (Matt Severance)Seattle's Jorge Polanco is the frontrunner for ALCS MVP as he went 4-for-9 with a homer and five RBI over the first two games, snapping a tie to put the Mariners ahead for good in both contests. Kirby is making his third career playoff start and second this postseason after allowing only three runs and recording 14 strikeouts over 10 innings against Detroit in the ALDS. Bieber, who went 1-0 with a 2.03 ERA in two starts for the Cleveland Guardians in the 2022 postseason, lasted only 2 2/3 innings in his turn against the New York Yankees in the ALDS but escaped with a no-decision despite yielding three runs on five hits and a walk. The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see Game 3 being a pitchers' duel, as the Over hits in well over 54% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Matt Severance, who is 26-9 on his last 35 MLB picks, likes the Mariners to take a commanding 3-0 series lead as they have posted the best home record in the majors since the trade deadline while the Blue Jays are a game under .500 on the road (41-42) in 2025.More MLB best betsBest apps, promos for MLB playoffs\nNHL best bets, where to watchPanthers at Red WingsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Red Wings +1.5 (-213)Even though the Panthers have been without Matthew Tkachuk (groin) and captain Aleksander Barkov (knee), they opened the season with a three-game winning streak and rallied from a 2-0 deficit against the Flyers to tie the contest last time out before allowing the go-ahead goal with 4:10 remaining in the third period. Detroit bounced back from a season-opening 5-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens by scoring a total of nine goals in back-to-back wins against the Maple Leafs. The SportsLine Projection Model believes the Red Wings will at least keep it close versus Florida, as its simulations have them covering the puck line 70% of the time.Blackhawks at BluesTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: St. Louis | TV: TNT | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Blues -239 | Expert: Blues -1 (Matt Severance)Like Detroit, the Blues are seeking their third consecutive victory after road wins against the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks in which they outscored the opposition by a combined 9-4 score. Chicago is coming off its first win of 2025-26, a 3-1 triumph over the Utah Mammoth that ended its season-opening three-game slide (0-2-1). The SportsLine Projection Model's simulations have the Blues winning 70% of the time, and Severance likes St. Louis to rebound from a 5-0 loss in its home opener against the Minnesota Wild and cover in its second contest of the campaign at Enterprise Center.CFB best bets, where to watchDelaware at Jacksonville StateTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Jacksonville, Ala. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Jacksonville State +125 | Expert: Delaware -2.5 (Sia Nejad)Delaware (3-2, 1-1) was denied a third straight victory last time out as it squandered a halftime lead by allowing 17 points in the third quarter and dropped a 27-24 decision to Western Kentucky for its first loss during Conference USA play. Quarterback Nick Minicucci set a season high with 314 passing yards and ran for three touchdowns for the second time this season in the loss. Jacksonville State (3-3, 2-0) is looking to post back-to-back wins for the first time this year after edging Sam Houston 29-27 on the road last Thursday. Cam Cook rushed for 218 yards and a pair of TDs as the Gamecocks won on a 52-yard field goal as time expired. The SportsLine Projection Model feels Jacksonville State will emerge victorious, as the team wins in 71% of its simulations, but SportsLine expert Sia Nejad believes Delaware will cover the spread as the Blue Hens defend the run fairly well, are coming off a bye and are getting healthier on offense.UTEP at Sam HoustonTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: CBS Sports Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Model: Sam Houston +3 (-115)Both teams are struggling mightily as they have a 1-11 combined record. UTEP is coming off its fourth consecutive loss, a 19-8 home setback against Liberty in which it was outgained 403-167. Sam Houston rallied from a 10-point deficit versus Jacksonville State last week and took the lead on a Hunter Watson's 19-yard touchdown pass to Chris Reed with 52 seconds left in the fourth quarter before falling 29-27 on the game-ending field goal and remaining winless. The SportsLine Projection Model sees the Bearkats covering the spread against the Miners in 65% of its simulations, which also have them posting their first victory of season 61% of the time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Sacramento Kings have reportedly signed forward Keegan Murray to a five-year, $140 million rookie extension, per ESPN's Shams Charania. The fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft was set to become a restricted free agent next summer, but this new deal locks him in with Sacramento through the 2030-31 season.The hope is that Murray can return to the version of himself that averaged 15.2 points on 35.8% from 3-point range in his sophomore season. He looked like a solid 3-and-D threat that season, but his numbers took a dive last season (12.4 points, 34.3% from deep), in part due to all of the changes around him on the roster with the additions of DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine, and the departure of De'Aaron Fox. There was also the firing of Mike Brown and promoting Doug Christie to the lead position, which certainly contributed to Murray's third-year slump. But with a full offseason with this roster and coaching staff, Murray could certainly return to form. Unfortunately, though, he'll be starting the season on the injured list after suffering a torn ligament in his thumb which will keep him sidelined for 4-6 weeks. That's a massive loss out the gate for the Kings. But in the long-term, locking Murray into an extension is a win for a franchise that has seemed directionless over recent years.\n        \n            \n                Kings remain directionless with Russell Westbrook signing: How Sacramento can escape pit of mediocrity\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMurray's extension comes on the heels of the team signing veteran guard Russell Westbrook to a deal on Wednesday, adding him to an already overcrowded backcourt. It's unclear how Westbrook will fit on this roster, or what minutes he'll get given the team already employs Dennis Schröder, Malik Monk and Keon Ellis. But that's small potatoes when you consider all the bad moves the Kings have made over the years (like trading Tyrese Haliburton).\nSigning Murray to an extension was the smart move. Either the Kings can see how Murray continues to develop, or he becomes a valuable trade chip for a contending team looking for size on the perimeter who is a career 37.2% 3-point shooter. Murray holds the Kings record for most 3s made in a single game (12), according CBS Sports research. He also broke the NBA rookie record for most 3-pointers in a season (206) and is one of just three players to post at least 500 3-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals over the last three seasons. The other two players in that category are Anthony Edwards and Derrick White, pretty good company to be in for the fourth-year forward. \n            \n    ",

Bet it at bet365 here:\nUnder 59.5 in Alabama vs. TennesseeAlabama is riding the longest home winning streak (15) in the nation, and this is going to be a tricky environment for Tennessee's offense. The Vols have only played one road game this season, which was an overtime win at Mississippi State at the end of September. This will be a significantly louder environment against a much better defense. Alabama has gone Under in nine of its last 13 games, and the model has the Under cashing in 64% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:Notre Dame -10.5 vs. USCNotre Dame allowed 98 points in its first three games combined this season, but it has been outstanding defensively since then. The Fighting Irish have allowed just 27 total points across their last three games, while quarterback CJ Carr has 1,622 passing yards, 13 touchdowns and three interceptions this season. Running backs Jeremiyah Love and Jadarian Price have combined for nearly 1,000 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. USC lost to Illinois in one of its two road games this season, and it also failed to cover the spread at Purdue last month. The model has Notre Dame covering 56% of the time. Bet it at bet365 now:BYU +4.5 vs. UtahThis is the second Big 12 meeting between these rivals after BYU picked up a 22-21 win last year. Cougars freshman quarterback Bear Bachmeier has been named the Big 12 Freshman of the Week three times this season. The latest example came after BYU's 33-27 double-overtime win at Arizona last week, as Bachmeier threw for 172 yards while rushing for 89 yards and two touchdowns. He is a big reason why BYU is covering the spread in 55% of simulations. Bet it at bet365 here:\nLooking for Week 7 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Saturday.

Alabama won 34-20 in 2023 and then Tennessee managed to grind out a 24-17 victory in 2024. Meanwhile, the Under has hit in nine of Alabama's last 13 games and there have only been more than 52 points scored in a Crimson Tide game once this season.

Meanwhile, USC is third in the nation in scoring (45.5 ppg) and ranks second in total offense (552.3 ypg). These two teams have combined to score at least 65 points in each of the last three seasons and the model predicts that the Over hits in 60% of simulations. Back the Over at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Missouri -115 vs. AuburnAuburn fought hard in losses to Oklahoma, Texas A&M and Georgia to start its SEC season, but the offense ultimately failed to make enough plays. Hugh Freeze's squad only managed to score 37 points while losing those three contests by a combined 23 points. Now Auburn draws another ranked opponent and Missouri will have a point to prove after a hard-fought 27-24 loss to Alabama, its first of the season.

    "body": "\n        Sunday's NFL schedule features four games in the 4 p.m. ET window, including the Indianapolis Colts looking to continue their shocking, dominant start to the season on the road against the Los Angeles Chargers. The Colts improved to 5-1 with a 31-27 win over the Cardinals last week, and the Chargers improved to 4-2 with a 29-27 win over the Dolphins. However, the Chargers are 0-4 against the spread in their last four games as the favorite in all four contests. The Chargers (-1.5) are favored once again in the latest Week 7 NFL odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5. The SportsLine model is backing the Colts to continue their winning ways and the Chargers to suffer another ATS loss, with the Colts covering the spread in 54% of simulations, while winning straight-up in 51% of the time.The model is also backing the Broncos (-7) to cover at home against the Giants, while the Over (54.5) hits 65% of the time in Cowboys vs. Commanders.

Bet it now at FanDuel:Broncos (-7) vs. GiantsThe Denver defense dominated in London last week, holding the Jets to 82 total yards while recording nine sacks. The Broncos are second in defensive scoring (15.8 ppg) and yards allowed (254.2 per game), while allowing the fewest yards per play (4.3) in the NFL. That isn't all due to the Jets game or inferior opponents, as Denver also held the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles to 17 points two weeks ago. The Broncos (4-2) have won three straight games, and although the Giants are coming off the high of a 34-17 win over the Eagles on Thursday Night Football at home, Jaxson Dart is 0-1 on the road with a 26-14 loss to the previously winless Saints. The model projects the Broncos to cover the spread in 56% of simulations for this 4:05 p.m. ET start.Colts (+1.5) vs. ChargersNot even the biggest Colts fans would have predicted this before the season started, but Indianapolis enters Week 7 with the No. 1 scoring offense at 32.3 ppg in the NFL this season. They've scored at least 29 points in five of six games, while scoring at least 20 points in all six contests, and are coming off a 31-27 win over the Cardinals. The Daniel Jones resurgence continues as the 28-year-old is seventh in passing yards (1,502 yards) this season, while Jonathan Taylor lead in rushing yards (603) and touchdowns (seven). The Chargers have been favored in four straight games but have failed to cover the spread in each contest. The model projects the Colts to cover in 54% of simulations for this 4:05 p.m. ET start.Cowboy vs. Commanders: Over 54.5 pointsCommanders vs. Cowboys has the largest over/under on the Week 7 NFL schedule, but the model doesn't believe the number is nearly enough. The Cowboys have the ideal combination for an Over to hit with the No. 3 scoring offense (29.7 ppg) and No. 31 scoring defense (30.7) in the league this season, with those averages surging past 54.5 points. The Over has hit in three straight Dallas games. The Cowboys have scored 40 points twice this season, and at least one team has scored 30 points in each of the last five Cowboys games. Washington has the No. 7 scoring offense (26.3 ppg) and the model expects plenty of scoring in this Dak Prescott vs. Jayden Daniels matchup, with the Over hitting in 65% of simulations in a 4:25 p.m. ET start.Want more Week 7 NFL picks?You've seen the model's Week 7 NFL best bets for Sunday.

However, New York's defense was disruptive in its 13-11 loss to the Denver Broncos last week, and Carolina has struggled mightily on the road, losing 18 of its past 20 road games. The model is projecting the Jets to record a 24-21 victory on Sunday, helping New York cover the spread in 59% of simulations. Vikings (+1.5) vs. EaglesThe Philadelphia Eagles have lost back-to-back games after winning their first four matchups of the season. The Eagles' recent struggles can be directly attributed to their ineffectiveness on offense. Philadelphia is averaging 274.5 yards per game on offense, which ranks 30th in the NFL. Now, the Eagles will go to a hostile environment in Minnesota, where the Vikings are 6-1 in their last seven games at home. SportsLine's model is backing Minnesota to cover the spread in 54% of simulations, targeting the Vikings as one of its top Week 7 NFL picks. Raiders vs. Chiefs: Over 45.5 pointsDon't look now, but the Chiefs have won three of their last four games after opening the season 0-2. Kansas City's offense has come to life in recent weeks, especially at home. The Chiefs have scored 30 or more points in each of their last two games at Arrowhead Stadium, and the total has gone Over in seven of Kansas City's last 10 meetings with Las Vegas. SportsLine's model is projecting these teams will combine for 49 points on Sunday, helping the Over hit in 57% of simulations.Want more Week 7 NFL picks?You've seen the model's Week 7 NFL best bets for Sunday.

Instead, the Cardinals will start backup Jacoby Brissett for the second consecutive week.Murray was listed as questionable due to a foot sprain after missing last Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts and has been limited in practice throughout the week. Coach Jonathan Gannon said Friday that Murray's status for Week 7 would be determined in the 48 hours leading up to Sunday's game. Murray was seen working with the Cardinals' scout team pass-catchers while Brissett worked with the primary receivers. Brissett put together a strong performance against the Colts last week, completing 27 of 44 passes for 320 yards and a pair of touchdowns. The Cardinals even held the lead on multiple occasions in the second half before the Colts eventually came away with a 31-27 win at home.Murray last played on Oct. 5 when he went 23 of 31 for 220 yards and a rushing touchdown in a 22-21 loss against the Tennessee Titans. On the season, the veteran signal-caller has completed 68.3% of his passes for 962 yards to go along with six touchdowns and three interceptions.\nThe Cardinals enter Sunday's game with a 2-4 record as they look to get back on track after losing their last four games.\n            \n    ",

Georgia is 5-1, including 3-1 in the SEC, and its lone loss came at home this season, falling to Alabama, 24-21, despite being the favorite. Georgia is 1-3 against the spread at home this season, with its only ATS victory coming by barely covering a 20-point spread in a 21-point victory over Kentucky. Meanwhile, Ole Miss is 6-0, including 3-0 in the SEC. Ole Miss has covered the spread in three of its last four games, but Saturday will be its first time as the underdog this season. The Rebels have a top 25 scoring offense (37.8 ppg, 12th in the nation) and defense (19.2 ppg, 24th in the nation), and the model projects Ole Miss to cover the spread in 64% of simulations. Back Ole Miss at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Under 59.5 in Alabama vs. Tennessee (-110)These two programs have gone Under this total in each of their matchups over the last two seasons, with Tennessee defeating Alabama, 24-17, last fall.

The Vols are coming off a 34-31 victory last week, but even that contest finished below its over/under of 68.5 points. This matchup pits one of the best scoring offenses in the nation against an elite defensive unit, with Tennessee ranking third at 43.4 ppg, while Alabama has the 15th-best scoring defense at 17.3 ppg allowed this season.

    "body": "\n        The game's greatest player turned in maybe the greatest single-game performance in baseball history Friday night. Shohei Ohtani, the singular star of the Dodgers, hit three home runs in his team's pennant-clinching win over the Brewers (LA 5, MIL 1), and also struck out 10 in six shutout innings. It would be cheesy if it were a movie, but it happened in real life.\"That was probably the greatest postseason performance of all time.   There's been a lot of postseason games, and there's a reason why he's  the greatest player on the planet,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the win. \"What he did on the mound, what he did at the bat, he created a  lot of memories for a lot of people.  To do it in a game-clinching game at home, wins the NLCS MVP, pretty  special.  I'm just happy to be able to go along for the ride.\"Our Matt Snyder called Ohtani's Game 4 the greatest postseason performance in history. Not only do I agree with him, I'll take it a step further and call it the greatest single-game performance period, regular season or postseason. The excellence at the plate and on the mound, the stakes, it all adds up to the best performance ever. An unbelievable player doing unbelievable things.In honor of Ohtani's Game 4 masterpiece, let's go back and relive 10 of the greatest single-game performances in baseball history. These are in chronological order.\n1916 World Series Game 2: Babe Ruth, Red SoxBefore he was the Sultan of Swat with the Yankees, Ruth was a terrific pitcher with the not-yet-rival Red Sox. In Game 2 of the 1916 World Series, Ruth threw a 14-inning complete game against the Brooklyn Robins, allowing just one run on four hits and three walks. He threw 145 pitches. The Babe went 0 for 5 at the plate, though he did drive in one of Boston's two runs. The 14 innings are still the record for a postseason game. The Red Sox went on to win the World Series in five games.1956 World Series Game 5: Don Larsen, YankeesThe only perfect game in postseason history, and, at the time, only the sixth perfect game in baseball history. Larsen went 27 up, 27 down against the Jackie Robinson/Duke Snider era Brooklyn Dodgers and struck out seven, a pretty high total in those days. He did it on two days' rest, too. The series was tied 2-2, so the perfect game gave the Yankees a 3-2 series lead. They went on to win the World Series in seven games.1967 World Series Game 7: Bob Gibson, CardinalsGibson started three times against the Red Sox in the 1967 World Series and threw three complete games, all wins. Game 7 was actually his worst pitching performance because he had the audacity to allow two runs. Gibson made up for it by hitting a home run of his own. \nGibson struck out 10 in the title-clinching win and is the only pitcher in history to throw a complete game and hit a home run in Game 7 of any series, let alone the World Series.June 23, 1971: Rick Wise, PhilliesThis is about as close to single-handedly winning a game as a player can get in this sport. Wise no-hit the Reds on this date and also hit two home runs. He drove in three of his team's four runs. Wise is the only pitcher in history to hit two home runs in a no-hitter. Yeah, it happened in June, and yeah, neither the Phillies (67-95) nor the Reds (79-83) were going anywhere that season, but still, it was a remarkable individual performance by Wise.1977 World Series Game 6: Reggie Jackson, YankeesJackson cemented his place as Mr. October with this legendary three-homer performance against the Dodgers in the 1977 World Series clincher. He also hit a home run in his final at-bat of Game 5, so Jackson hit four home runs in four consecutive at-bats off four different pitchers. \nIt was only the third three-homer game in the World Series at the time (Ruth did it in 1926 and 1928), and it ended what was at the time the longest World Series drought in Yankees' history (14 years).1988 World Series Game 2: Orel Hershiser, DodgersShutout on the mound, perfect day at the plate. Hershiser, having seen his record 59-inning scoreless streak end a few weeks earlier, tossed a three-hit shutout against the Athletics (all three hits were singles), plus he went 3 for 3 with two doubles as a hitter. It was Hershiser's second of three straight complete games that postseason. He also went the distance in the World Series clinching Game 5 win a few days later. May 5, 1998: Kerry Wood, CubsThe case can be made that this is the most dominant pitching performance in baseball history. In his fifth career start, the 20-year-old Wood struck out 20 Astros in a one-hit complete game shutout. The one hit was an infield single. Those 1998 Astros were a powerhouse -- they went on to win 102 games and scored 29 more runs than the next best team in the league. So it was a transcendent performance by a rookie pitcher against a dominant offense.\nAt the time, it was the third 20-strikeout game in history (Roger Clemens did it in 1986 and 1996). My favorite fun fact about this game: Houston's 3-4-5 hitters (Jeff Bagwell, Jack Howell, Moises Alou) went a combined 0 for 9 with nine strikeouts.Sept. 19, 2024: Shohei Ohtani, DodgersYou could argue Ohtani owns the greatest single-game performance in both the regular season and postseason. Last Sept. 19 in Miami, Ohtani went 6 for 6 with two doubles, three home runs, two stolen bases, and 10 RBI. The first stolen base was No. 50 on the season and the second home run was No. 50 as well. With this monster game -- it was only the second six-hit, five-extra-base hit performance in history (Shawn Green did it in his four-homer game in 2002) -- Ohtani became the first and still only member of the 50-50 club.July 25, 2025: Nick Kurtz, AthleticsRemember when I said Ohtani had the second six-hit, five-extra-base hit game in history last Sept. 19? Kurtz had the third this July 25. He went 6 for 6 with a double and four home runs against the Astros, and that double very nearly left Daikin Park for what would have been the first five-homer game in baseball history:\nKurtz also scored six runs, which is a shockingly exclusive club. Only nine times has a player scored six runs in a game (Mel Ott did it twice). There have been more than twice as many perfect games (24) as six-run games (nine).2025 NLCS Game 4: Shohei Ohtani, DodgersThree home runs at the plate, 10 strikeouts in six shutout innings on the mound. Only one other pitcher in baseball's Modern Era has hit three home runs in a game (Jim Tobin in 1942), and Ohtani did it in a pennant-clinching win. And to think, everyone was wondering what was wrong with him leading into this game because he had struggled at the plate this postseason. Ohtani more than earned the NLCS MVP with this one single game.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe've got another loaded college football Saturday in store for Week 8, with a pair of ranked SEC clashes among the top games of the day. The action begins right away when Vanderbilt hosts LSU, and when that's over, Georgia will look for revenge for last year's loss against Ole Miss. Some of the other top college football games on Saturday include Georgia Tech at Duke, Texas Tech at Arizona State, Tennessee at Alabama and USC at Notre Dame.College football isn't all that's going on across Saturday, as there are also 13 NHL games, including the Seattle Kraken at Toronto Maple Leafs, Boston Bruins at Colorado Avalanche and the Carolina Hurricanes at Los Angeles Kings. We're also just a day away from a huge Week 7 NFL slate. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet at the top sportsbooks on Saturday, Oct. 18. All times Eastern. CFB best bets today, where to watchNo. 10 LSU at No. 17 VanderbiltTime: 12 p.m. | Location: Nashville | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: LSU money line +103 | Expert: Vanderbilt -2.5 (Jeff Hochman)\nVanderbilt is coming off a bye week after losing to Alabama, while LSU recovered from a close loss to Ole Miss with a 20-10 win over South Carolina. It's rare to see the Commodores as favorites in SEC play after years of futility, but that's the case Saturday afternoon when they welcome the 10th-ranked Tigers to town. Vandy's offense is humming behind Diego Pavia, but LSU's defense has been stellar this year, which has helped mask an underperforming offense led by Garrett Nussmeier. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times, is backing LSU on the money line with the Tigers winning in nearly 70% of simulations. SportsLine expert Jeff Hochman, however, likes Vanderbilt to win and cover against the Tigers. \"The Commodores have significantly improved their scoring margin, offensive efficiency, third-down performance, and defensive consistency compared to last year's squad,\" Hochman said. \"With an impressive 82.5 QBR (ranked 14th), Diego Pavia and company look to end their 10-game skid against LSU.\"No. 5 Ole Miss at No. 9 GeorgiaTime: 3:30 p.m. | Location: Athens | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Ole Miss money line +219 | Expert: Ole Miss +7.5 (Emory Hunt)\nGeorgia doesn't get too many \"revenge games\" under Kirby Smart since the Bulldogs don't lose very often, but this week is just that as Ole Miss won this contest 28-10 last year. The game is in Athens this year, where Smart and Co. have been stellar in recent years. The Rebels are undefeated but have not looked all that great of late, winning closer than expected games against lesser competition. The Bulldogs' lone loss this year was to Alabama. The Rebels are underdogs here, but the SportsLine model has them winning in over 50% of simulations. SportsLine expert Emory Hunt likes Ole Miss to at least cover on Saturday. \"Maybe last week was a bit of a lookahead trap game spot, but expect (Ole Miss) to be razor focused heading on the road against Georgia,\" Hunt said. \"On top of that, I don't believe Georgia is playing all that consistently to be favored by this much vs this particular team.\"More CFB best bets:Bruce Marshall's weekend betting guideThomas Casale's spots to targetChinmay Vaidya's Week 8 bold betsBrandon Gustafson's Week 8 upset picksBrandon Gustafson's Week 8 totals picksNHL best bets today, where to watchKraken at Maple LeafsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Toronto | TV: NHL Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Seattle +1.5As the Mariners and Blue Jays fight for the American League pennant in MLB, the two cities' hockey teams also face off this weekend north of the border when the Kraken visit the Maple Leafs. Seattle, now in its fifth season as the NHL's newest franchise, is off to a 2-0-2 start, dropping each of its last two games in overtime. The Maple Leafs are 3-2-0 and are winners of two in a row. The SportsLine model likes Seattle tonight, and it has the Kraken covering +1.5 in over 70% of simulations.Looking ahead: Falcons vs. 49ersTime: 8:20 p.m., Sunday | Location: Santa Clara | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 47 | Expert: Falcons +3 (R.J. White)\nThe Falcons are coming off their biggest win of the season as they handed the Buffalo Bills just their second loss of the 2025 campaign. As for the 49ers, they fell in Tampa Bay on Sunday as the Bucs moved to 5-1 and the 49ers are now one of three NFC West teams with a 4-2 record. The SportsLine model likes the Under here, as Under 47 hits in nearly 60% of model simulations. NFL expert R.J. White thinks the 49ers' injuries, especially on defense, will lead to an Atlanta cover on Sunday Night Football. \"The 49ers have been walking wounded all year, with the offense scraping together a passing game on a weekly basis,\" White said. \"They'll have to face the second-best defense in net yards per pass attempt. Don't expect the 49ers' 32nd-ranked run game to bail them out either. I would've still thought about playing San Francisco at home if I thought the defense could dictate this game, but with Fred Warner joining Nick Bosa on the sidelines, I don't have much hope for that unit.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It was always going to end this way. Not because Nottingham Forest are the Premier League's most chaotic club, though they probably are. It doesn't really matter in this case. No matter how effective the organization around him, Ange Postecglou could never have made it work at Nottingham Forest. One of the sport's most didactic coaches, at the helm of a squad as ill suited to his philosophy as any? If anything it is remarkable he even got to game eight, a 3-0 defeat at home to Chelsea for which Postecoglou's presence at the post match press conference was not required.\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that after a series of disappointing results and performances, Ange Postecoglou has been relieved of his duties as head coach with immediate effect,\" read a statement posted so briskly that there was not even time to include the customary somber corner flag picture. Evangelos Marinakis marched into his box in the 67th minute and it was obvious that that was that. He didn't need to see Reece James add a third to know what was coming. Nor did the City Ground, who have never really taken to the man who replaced the beloved Nuno Espirito Santo. \"You don't know what you're doing,\" was the cry when Callum Hudson-Odoi was substituted on after Chelsea's opener. Postecglou must have known what he'd be doing tomorrow though. He departs on his 39th day in the job, the shortest tenured permanent manager in Premier League history. It seems appropriate that that record should belong to this particular iteration of Forest, a team who entered the Premier League club having headily overindulged at the pre-drinks. They've barely sobered up since.\nBarely into their fourth season in the top flight, Forest have cycled through 80 permanent new signings, two head coaches beloved by the City Ground and a string of controversies that could probably stretch the length of the River Trent. They are a club indelibly in the image of their owner, for good as well as ill. Few are as demanding as Marinakis, even fewer are rewarded with a rise from Championship to Europa League. The eight years since Marinakis bought into the English game have delivered highs that Forest fans have not seen since the days of Brian Clough and his immediate predecessors. The price to be paid for that is continual turbulence, the sense of a club pirouetting on the edge of a volcano. It is less than half a year since the owner bawled out Nuno on the City Ground pitch. A further 160 days earlier it would have been unimaginable that Forest would be in the mix for Champions League qualification at the time.Marinakis seems combustible. His club certainly is. Nuno lost his job not because of his bust up with the owner but with the head of football. Anyone who knew Edu from his time at Arsenal would speak glowingly about his ability to bring colleagues together, to create a family atmosphere across a club. Nuno himself was hardly known to blow his top without provocation. This was a head coach who had dealt quite ably with tempestuous ownership at the highest level of the Saudi Pro League but who felt compelled to blow up his position inside three games.\nSources with knowledge of the situation at Forest have argued that Nuno's behaviour in his final weeks left Marinakis with no choice. One thing that can certainly be said to the owner's credit is that he does not dally over decisions. Postecoglou had to go. The cavalier high line that is his calling card was always going to be a challenge for the likes of Nikola Milenkovic. Forest may have been out over their skies in terms of results last season but much of the reason for their rapidity was in the aggressive countering wing play personified by Hudson-Odoi, who has not seen a Premier League starting XI since Postecglou's first game. The chopping and changing of lineups would have continued but, even after a summer of acquiring younger, more technical players, Forest's squad was still one poorly designed to play the Aussie's football.The fans weren't having him and Postecoglou's ever more spiky approach under questioning was not going to ingratiate him. It is now 31 defeats in his last 50 Premier League matches. His style of play demands a talent imbalance but he has not proven himself capable of dealing with the spotlight that comes with such squads. His time in the Premier League may be over.For Forest to avoid following him out of the top flight then they will surely need to revert to an approach closer to Nuno's. That is reflected in their thinking over who might step in. Sources with knowledge of Forest's thinking expect former Burnley and Everton boss Sean Dyche to receive serious consideration. He is as good an insurance policy against relegation as exists on the managerial market right now, something which must seriously enter Forest's thinking. They are 18th in the table with all three promoted sides above them. Their expected goal difference suggests they could dragged into the mire with West Ham and Wolves at a time when Sunderland, and perhaps Leeds as well, look capable of breaking the failure streak of the newly promoted clubs.\nIf it is to be Dyche you can rest assured that it won't be for the long term. Emerging links with Roberto Mancini are much more reflective of the sort of club their owner expects Forest to be. Marinakis' actions have made clear that he will not simply tolerate ongoing Premier League football at the City Ground. He demands more from Nottingham Forest, no matter the chaos that getting his will brings.\n            ",

Ole Miss is coming off a 24-21 win over Washington State last weekend, while Georgia downed Auburn 20-10. The Rebels (6-0, 3-0 SEC), who are looking to win the SEC title outright for the first time since 1963, are 1-0 on the road this year. The Bulldogs (5-1, 3-1 SEC), who last won the SEC title outright in 2022, when they also were national champions, are 3-1 on their home field. Ole Miss lists running back Logan Diggs and receiver Devin Price as probable. Offensive linemen Earnest Greene III and Juan Gaston have the same designation for Georgia. Kickoff from Sanford Stadium in Athens, Ga., is at 3:30 p.m. ET.

In a 44-41 overtime win over Tennessee, he connected on 23 of 31 passes for 304 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing 13 times for 38 yards and one score.Junior wide receiver Zachariah Branch is among Stockton's top targets in the passing game. In six games, he has caught 27 passes for 291 yards (10.8 average) and two touchdowns. In a 45-7 win over Marshall in the season opener on Aug. 30, he caught three passes for 95 yards and one touchdown.

Since taking over for an injured Austin Simmons, Ole Miss hasn't missed a beat. Chambliss has completed 85 of 130 passes for 1,286 yards and seven touchdowns with one interception and a 164.7 rating. He also is second on the team in rushing, carrying 61 times for 281 yards (4.6 average) and three touchdowns. In the win over Washington State, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 253 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for another score. Simmons is not on the injury report, and should be available if needed in this one.Sophomore running back Kewan Lacy is the main weapon in the ground attack. In six games so far, he has carried 126 times for 587 yards (4.7 average) and eight touchdowns. He also has 13 receptions for 87 yards. He has surpassed 100 yards rushing in three games, including last week when he carried 24 times for 142 yards against Washington State.

    "body": "\n        When the Washington Commanders, a team with a legitimate shot at winning the Super Bowl heading into the 2025 NFL season, wanted to trade Brian Robinson, a proven, veteran running back, due to the presence of a seventh-round rookie running back, many were surprised and wondered why Washington would take an unnecessary risk like that. But it didn't take long for the Commanders to showcase they knew exactly what they were doing when Jacory Croskey-Merritt rushed for 82 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries against the Giants in Week 1. The rookie has scored at least one touchdown in three of six games, including two touchdowns two weeks ago, making him one of the SportsLine Machine Learning Model's top picks for Week 7 anytime TD scorer bets at -125 odds. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 7 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Dolphins running back De'Von Achane (+105) and Chargers wide receiver Quentin Johnston (+180) at online sports betting sites.Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 7 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 7 NFL picks.

With Tyreek Hill (knee) out for the season, Achane will become even more important to Miami's offense, and after putting up those numbers against a stronger defense like the Chargers last week, the model likes his value at finding the end zone on Sunday. Achane has a touchdown in five of six games this season, including at least one in each of his last three games, heading into a matchup against the Browns. Cleveland has allowed the opposing team's RB1 to score in three straight games. There are reports of winds up to 50-60 miles per hour on Sunday, which could lead to a larger role for Achane in both the rushing and receiving game, increasing his chances of scoring a touchdown.Click here to bet on Achane as a Week 7 anytime touchdown scorer at DraftKings, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 wins and three months of NBA League Pass free.Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Commanders (-125)Croskey-Merritt played a season-high 66% of snaps last week, as the seventh-round rookie has seen his snap count rise in each of the last three weeks. The 24-year-old has led the Washington backfield in each of the four weeks since Austin Ekeler's season-ending Achilles injury, and after surpassing the 60% of snaps mark of the first time all year last week, that's a trend that seems likely to continue, He has at least one touchdown three of six games this season heading into a matchup against the Cowboys, who have the second-worst scoring defense (30.7 ppg) in the NFL this season. Dallas has allowed a touchdown to the opposing team's RB1 in two of the last three games, and with this game having the highest over/under on the Week 7 NFL schedule, the model projects plenty of scoring opportunities for Croskey-Merritt.Click here to bet on Croskey-Merritt as a Week 7 anytime TD scorer with the latest Caesars Sportsbook promo code CBS20X, which gives new users 20 100% profit boost tokens with their first $1 bet.Quentin Johnston, Chargers (+180)Johnston missed last week with a hamstring injury, but after a full week of practice, the 24-year-old receiver should be good to go for Sunday. With 26 receptions and four touchdowns over five games, Johnston has shed the image of him dropping passes in games and practices and is playing toward his potential as a first-round pick. Johnston, the No. 21 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has at least one touchdown in three of five games this season heading into a matchup against the Colts, who are dealing with a bevy of injuries in their secondary. The model gives Johnston a 48% chance of a touchdown, compared to his implied odds of 35.71%, making him a top Week 7 anytime touchdown scorer value.Click here to play Johnston at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Want more Week 7 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 7.

One of his top prop picks this week is going Over 52.5 receiving yards (-110) for Carolina receiver Tetairoa McMillan.\"We're going to buy the dip as we're getting a hefty discount on this receiving line from Tet McMillan who is operating as a clear cut WR1 and has performed well in this role despite low volume and inconsistent QB play,\" PropStarz said. \"This is a good matchup against a Jets pass defense that ranks 30th in DVOA, 30th in EPA Per Dropback, and 28th in Coverage Grade. They've also been extremely generous to opposing number 1 WRs as they are currently dead last in 1st Read EPA. Bryce Young is attempting a first-read throw on 65% of his dropbacks, which is the fifth-highest rate in the league. He's trying to get the ball where it is supposed to go and its designed to go to McMillan.\" You can see all of PropStarz's NFL picks here.You can also use the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets instantly:Top Week 7 NFL expert picks from Eric CohenCohen has hit 65% of his straight-up NFL picks this season, and now he's locked in his picks and exact score prediction for each game during the Week 7 NFL schedule.

I do,\" Cohen said. \"Second year QB Drake Maye is playing at a high level and the poor Titans defense isn't going to slow him much.

    "body": "\n        Two AFC teams battling to get out of a 1-5 hole face off in NFL Week 7 as the Cleveland Browns host the Miami Dolphins on Paramount+. Miami suffered another close loss in Week 6, falling at home 29-27 to the Los Angeles Chargers. Meanwhile, the Browns continued to struggle generating offense in a 23-9 Week 6 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kickoff from Huntington Bank Field is set for 1 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. Cleveland is a 2.5-point favorite in the latest Dolphins vs. Browns odds from SportsLine consensus, while the over/under for total points scored is 40.5. The Browns are -150 money line favorites (risk $150 to win $100), while the Dolphins are +126 underdogs.

Tua Tagovailoa threw three interceptions in that game and will now face one of the toughest defenses in the league. The Dolphins offensive line has been porous and the defense has allowed 389.3 total yards per game, which could leave room for Dillon Gabriel to have his best NFL career start.  Gabriel only completed 29-of-52 passes and was held without a touchdown against Pittsburgh, but also threw for 221 yards and avoided throwing any picks. Fellow rookie Quinshon Judkins was held out of the endzone in Week 6 but could have a rebound game against Miami's league-worst run defense. The Browns are holding opposing offenses to 79.7 rushing yards per game, which will make it difficult for De'Von Achane to get the ball downfield.Click here to bet Dolphins vs. Browns at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Dolphins vs. Browns score prediction, picksThe Browns are 2-4-0 ATS this season and haven't covered the spread since Week 3. Plus, they had to rely on field goals to get on the scoreboard last week. However, Cleveland's superior defense can stymy a struggling Dolphins offense in a low-scoring -- and possibly quite ugly -- AFC matchup.

    "body": "\n        Penn State's firing of coach James Franklin was a move that reverberated throughout college football, and championship coaches Nick Saban and Ryan Day are the latest to react. The Nittany Lions, who owe Franklin a hefty buyout, ranked second in preseason polls after reaching last year's College Football Playoff semifinal. Penn State logged five top 10 finishes under Franklin.\"It's unfair as hell,\" Saban said on College GameDay. \"For you to go to the Rose Bowl, the Fiesta Bowl, get in the final four, come out and being ranked No. 1 this year ... an expectation you created, by which you accomplished at Penn State. And for those people not to show enough appreciation for that and gratitude for all the hard work that you did, I'm saying, it's unfair.\"Seated next to Franklin on set, Saban asked him if high-end expectations before the year played into his team's lackluster start.\"I think, Coach, you understand this better than anybody, right? You've used the phrase rat poison,\" Franklin said. \"The negative is rat poison that you've got to get everybody to tune out and the positive is rat poison. That creates a ton of pressure, pressure we've earned. We've created that pressure.  And I think that's the thing I'm most proud of, the point that you said. When I took over the program 12 years ago, it was in a very different situation than it is now. That's something I take great pride in.\"\nOhio State coach Ryan Day, who went unbeaten against Franklin, described recent changes in college football and the return on investments needed. \"To say the amount of money we make nowadays doesn't play into it would be naive,\" Day said Saturday on CBS Sports HQ. \"That really plays into it. We sign great contracts. There's a lot expected on us, so we have to perform. But at the end of the day, what we have to make sure we focus on is our people. It's the coaches in the building and their families, but more importantly, it's our players. Winning just allows us an opportunity to continuing having an impact on people. that's why you get into coaching.\n\"We can't lose focus on that, as hard as that is. The amount of pressure that can come on all of us, it's easier to lose that type of focus. But we cant. To me, that's what it's all about. Easier said than done.\"\n            ",

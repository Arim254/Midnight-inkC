With these types of  promotions, you generally need to place a bet of at least a certain  amount to receive a certain amount of bonus bets, but in this case, there is no condition of winning the initial bet, as is the case at some sportsbooks. These welcome promos are  considered to be geared towards beginners or smaller bettors, and they're a great way to maximize the winnings and satisfaction of the user's initial experience. These welcome promos are considered to be geared towards beginners or smaller bettors, and they're a great way to maximize the winnings and satisfaction of the user's initial experience. The FanDuel promo code, DraftKings promo code, Caesars promo code and bet365 bonus offer all follow this format.The BetMGM bonus code  follows the \"first bet offer\" style of promo. You can bet up to $1,500  on your first bet and get it back as bonus bets if you lose.The Fanatics Sportsbook promo code  has its own unique structure. Bet insurance is FanCash back if your wager loses, but instead of having the insurance only apply to your first  bet with the sportsbook, Fanatics gives you bet insurance in FanCash on one wager each day for 10 consecutive days after account creation, up to $200 in FanCash per day. That's up to $2,000 in total FanCash after 10 days.  How to sign up for Borgata Sportsbook and claim the promo (Note: Borgata Sportsbook is currently only available to users in the state of New Jersey.)

    "body": "\nLenny Wilkens, the most prolific coach in NBA history who won a league championship and got inducted three times into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, died at his home on Sunday. He was 88 years old. Initially a legendary player for the Hawks, SuperSonics and Cavaliers, Wilkens continued his career as the winningest (and losingest) coach in NBA history at the time of his retirement. While Wilkens has coached more games than anyone else in NBA history, he has since been passed in the career wins category by Greg Popovich and Don Nelson.\"Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA – as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game's most respected ambassadors,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"But even more impressive than Lenny's basketball accomplishments, which included two Olympic gold medals and an NBA championship, was his commitment to service – especially in his beloved community of Seattle where a statue stands in his honor.\"He influenced the lives of countless young people as well as generations of players and coaches who considered Lenny not only a great teammate or coach but also an extraordinary mentor who led with integrity and true class.\" Wilkens -- who served as a player-coach for Seattle from 1979-72 -- led the SuperSonics to the franchise's only NBA title in 1979. He coached Team USA when the men's basketball team won the gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, previously serving as an assistant on the famed \"Dream Team\" squad that captured gold at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Wilkens, whose No. 19 was retired by the Sonics, received his first Hall of Fame induction in 1989 for his 15-year playing career, which included nine All-Star selections and an All-Star Game MVP in 1971. He was named to the NBA's 50th and 75th All-Anniversary teams.The pinnacle of Wilkens' coaching career was Seattle's five-game series win over the defending champion Washington Bullets in the 1979 NBA Finals. The Sonics extracted revenge after falling to the Bullets in seven games during the 1978 NBA Finals.Wilkens continued his career with the Cavs, then won NBA Coach of the Year honors in 1994 after leading the Hawks to a 52-27 regular-season record. He finished his career with short coaching stints with the Raptors and Knicks, taking both teams to the playoffs. In 2021, Wilkens was named one of the 15 greatest coaches in NBA history. He received his second Hall of Fame induction for his coaching in 1998 and his third in 2009 for his Olympic career.A two-time All-American at Providence, Wilkens was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. \n            ",

However, the no sweat bet is paid in bonus bets, so if that second bet hits, the player will not receive the stake, only the winnings.Crab Sports' introductory offer most resembles Caesars, where a 100% profit boost is available to new customers. The difference is that Caesars offers 20 100% profit boosts (with a max. stake of $25 each) while Crab Sports gives new users one chance to go big up to $500.How to sign up for Crab Sports and claim the promo codeThose looking to sign up for CrabSports and claim this offer can follow these outlined steps:1.   Click on the link in this article to begin the process.2.   Click the SIGNUP button to start registration.3.   Fill in your personal details including name, email, address, and date of birth.4.   The next screen will ask for your address and last four digits of your Social Security number.5.   When prompted on the third screen, enter Crab Sports promo code CBSSPORTS.6.   Configure 2 Factor Authentication.7.   Make your first deposit. You can use the various deposit methods including debit card, credit card, or bank transfer.8.   Place your first wager up to $500 to redeem your 100% profit boost. How to place a bet on Crab SportsPlacing a straight wager is relatively straightforward on Crab Sports, with the user needing to click on the sport, game, and market of their choosing before selecting the dollar amount and placing the bet. For parlays and round robins, tabs appear in the betting slip making this process easy. For SGPs, it's a bit trickier compared to most other sportsbooks. A user must click on the game of choice, followed by the Same Game Parlay option, select multiple plays, and click Add to Betslip before placing the wager. Multiple SGPs are able to be combined into parlays. Get started now:Crab Sports promo and bonuses for existing usersLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports features promotions for existing users that can enhance the value of their bets. With both profit boosts and no sweat options, there is plenty for Maryland users to enjoy after the initial welcome bonus.Best Crab Sports promos this weekEvery day SGP 50% bet insurance – users can place a $50 or greater bet on a three-or-more-leg SGP (+500 odds or longer). If that first eligible bet each day loses, the player will receive a 50% free bet up to $50. This promotion is unique to Crab Sports on a daily basis and most sportsbooks will offer a similar promotion occasionally at best.Crab Parlay Boost – With qualifying bets, a percentage boost will be added for each leg of the parlay up to 50% for the 15th leg.Social giveaway – Players who win the Crab Sports social media giveaway will receive a $25 Lottery Ticket Free Bet that must be used within four days of issuance.Refer a friend – New referrals and those who refer a friend will each receive a $10 Lottery Ticket Free Bet upon using a unique code given by the existing member.Deposit matchesOccasionally, sportsbooks offer deposit matches in which the user must deposit a required amount or more before receiving additional funds via cash or bonus bets. Most sportsbooks will require the deposit + bonus amount to be wagered before requesting a withdrawal. For Crab Sports, after the first bet, all cash winnings may be withdrawn as any no sweat bets aren't considered cash.No Sweat Bet tokensUsers can apply a token where if the selected bet loses, the player will get a refund in the form of a free bet, which is not redeemable for cash.Boosted OddsGenerally two leg Same Game Parlays where the sportsbook will enhance the odds to make it more enticing to bettors.Profit boosts / SGP profit boostsLike most sportsbooks, Crab Sports offers profit boosts for parlays and occasionally straight wagers. Some profit boosts incentivize adding more legs to the parlay for a greater boost.Crab Sports user experienceThe user experience at Crab Sports is friendly as the sportsbook relies on a simplistic design where the odds pop due to a different color scheme than the rest of the text. The menus are easy to follow and choosing a sport or game is no more difficult than at any other sportsbook. User InterfaceThe design of the site is appealing with several variations of blue mixed with a grey color scheme, with black, white, and blue text. I like that the odds pop on the site, with a larger font and navy-blue text against a grey background. While the design looks a bit antiquated compared to the national competition, I can't say that it's a deterrent by any means from playing on the site.Crab Sports Home Screen LayoutOn desktop, the home screen features rotating banners with promotions and top games for that night. Live betting is prominently featured in the center with the games from around the world currently in play. On the left side, Links, Popular, and All Sports give the user plenty of menu options, as does a bar with each sport's icon towards the top. The My Selections tab on the right is visible throughout so you can see which picks you have selected. Overall, Crab Sports provides a clean look and is easily navigable on computers.On mobile, the home screen shows the sport icons at the very top, followed by rotating banners, and the live games. The menus at the bottom include Home, A-Z Sports, an icon to view your selections, Live, and My Bets. Once again, a very clean design for users and easy to navigate for both new and experienced players.Sportsbook app design, speed, functionalitySimilar to the desktop site, the odds pop on the app with larger navy-blue text against a lighter background. The functionality works similarly to the desktop site and lag doesn't seem to be an issue in my testing. But it's hard to compare Crab Sports' app to the feature-rich national brands such as DraftKings and FanDuel.For players who know what they want to bet when coming to the site, Crab Sports provides a fine experience. But if you're looking to browse random odds and categories, you have to go game-by-game at Crab Sports vs. menu items showing all games on several other sites.Geolocation issues can be common on any sportsbook app but in most cases has not been a major complaint of Crab Sports customers thus far.

When it comes to props though, the selections are much fewer compared to the larger sportsbooks, which allow more customization as compared to just over/under a set yardage or hits total for example.The Same Game Parlay builder seems like a first-generation version of what we see on the likes of DraftKings, FanDuel, and Fanatics now and can be tedious. You must click on the builder before adding SGP picks which is a feature of the past on most books. There have been customer reviews stating that live betting cashout offers don't compare favorably to most other sportsbooks, with early cashout offers seemingly lower than other books.Crab Sports key betting featuresCrab Sports offers many of the same betting features found in most apps including:Early CashoutWhile its offers are not as financially friendly as some of the larger sportsbooks, Crab Sports does offer the ability for users to get out of eligible bets before their conclusion with a profit or loss.Live BettingCrab Sports gives Maryland users the opportunity to bet during just about any sporting event while in progress. Odds changes are easy to note with green and red arrows upon any line movement.SGP generationNot only can users create SGPs, they may parlay multiple SGPs, albeit each one must be created separately. For eligible games, a Same Game Parlay button appears which must be selected before options are chosen.How to track your bets on Crab SportsOn desktop, the My Selection tab on the right side of the page makes it easy to follow along with your bets. The My Bets tab allows you to view your existing wagers. On the app, the icon of a ticket in the center at the bottom makes it easy for players to make their selections. To track selections on the app, My Bets on the bottom right is the place to click.Crab Sports customer supportIn addition to comprehensive help, rules, and FAQ pages, users with an issue may email support@crabsports.com, with the response time usually within an hour or two. Crab Sports does not feature a live chat as most other sportsbooks offer.Betting on Maryland sports teamsCrab Sports is a sportsbook exclusively for Maryland sports bettors. All championship odds are for the 2025-26 seasons and from Crab Sports (updated 10/10/25).Baltimore Ravens (NFL) (+1700)With superstars (quarterback) Lamar Jackson and (running back) Derrick Henry, the Ravens were expected to be a Super Bowl contender again in 2025. Baltimore seeks its third Super Bowl title, having won in the 2001 and 2013 seasons. As long as Jackson is healthy and leading Baltimore, the Ravens should remain a threat in the AFC playoffs.Washington Commanders (NFL) (+1900)Led 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year, QB Jayden Daniels, Washington D.C.'s team is capable of making another sustained run in the playoffs. Daniels looks like an elite quarterback as he was projected to be after winning the Heisman Trophy in college.Washington Wizards (NBA) (+49900)As the team with the worst odds to win it all per Crab Sports, this doesn't appear to be a year of promise for the rebuilding Wizards franchise.Baltimore Orioles (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)At 75-87, the Orioles finished last in the American League East Division, which produced three playoff teams. They will look to bounce back in 2026 with a young core including shortstop Gunnar Henderson and second baseman Jackson Holliday.Washington Nationals (MLB) (2026 odds: TBD)The 2019 World Series champions are in rebuilding mode for the next few years, as evidenced by a 66-96 campaign in 2025. Outfielder James Wood is the team's brightest star with some additional promising prospects in need of more MLB seasoning.Washington Capitals (NHL) (+2900)The NHL's all-time leading goal scorer, Alex Ovechkin, looks to close out his career in style, adding a second Stanley Cup championship to his resume. Washington most recently won sports' greatest trophy in 2017.Crab Sports responsible gaming toolsAt the bottom of the page on both desktop and mobile, users can click on the Responsible Gambling section.The sections on that page's FAQ include:How to play responsiblyWhat is Problem Gambling?What support is available?What tools can you use to manage your gambling?Voluntary ExclusionUnderage GamblingLinks on the page for gambling help resources include:MD Gambling HelpMD Problem GamblingMD LotteryMaryland State Lottery & Gaming Control AgencyNational Council on Problem GamblingGamblers AnonymousGam-AnonInternational Center for Responsible Gaming988 Suicide & Crising Lifeline Crab Sports banking methodsCrab Sports offers a number of ways for customers to deposit and withdraw money.Deposit methodsThese deposit methods are available for most users.Quick deposit methodsFeesProcess timeMin. depositOnline Banking (via Plaid)$0Instant$10Debit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Credit Card ((VISA, Mastercard, Discover)$0Instant$10Withdrawal methodsHere are the primary ways to withdraw money at Crab Sports.Withdrawal optionProcess TimeMax withdrawalOnline Banking (via Plaid)1-2 business daysUnknownDebit Card (VISA, Mastercard, Discover)1-2 business daysUnknownCrab Sports review: Final verdictFor Maryland users, Crab Sports is a fine alternative to the national sportsbooks. The design is simplistic but the interface is easy to use. If you're looking for the bells and whistles of additional menus, a search function, and more individual player betting options, then this isn't the right sportsbook for you. But if you're located in the state and want to take advantage of the generous signup offer, Crab Sports is worth a long look.The app works well and betting pregame or during the live action is easy. Betting SGPs is slower than at other sportsbooks, but at least it is still possible. There are limited options for deposits / withdrawals and the customer support is only via email. This sportsbook does not offer a rewards program as of now. Nonetheless, I recommend giving Crab Sports a shot if you're in Maryland.Honest feedback for how Crab Sports can improveEnhance Same Game Parlay betting: Compared to other sportsbooks, betting SGPs is slow. Clicking on multiple lines / props from the same game should automatically trigger an SGP, whereas now it only works if you press a specific button.Offer more menus for betting selected markets: Similar to BetMGM who also falls short in this category, Crab Sports should create menus so users don't have to click on each game separately to add a certain market.More deposit and withdrawal options: It seems almost standard that options such as PayPal and Venmo, which allow seamless money transfers, should be allowed at every sportsbook. This is a necessary addition in due time for Crab Sports.Crab Sports FAQHow do you get the Crab Sports promo?Use promo code CBSSPORTS on the third page of the registration screen and deposit up to $500 to receive a 100% profit boost on your first wager.How long do Crab Sports withdrawals take?Generally 1-2 business days, if not faster for withdrawals via debit card and online banking.Can you cash out bonus bets on Crab Sports?No, all bonus bets must be played through before attempting to redeem them for cash.How do you contact Crab Sports?Email support@crabsports.com with any questions or inquiries.Do you need a promo code for Crab Sports?Yes, use promo code CBSSPORTS when initially signing up.Does Crab Sports have a good rewards program?To date, there has been no mention of a rewards program for Crab Sports.Where is Crab Sports available?You may only play on Crab Sports if you're physically located in Maryland and are 21 years of age or older.\n            ",

The 49ers will host the Rams at 4:25 p.m. ET, with Los Angeles listed as a 5.5-point road favorite. Elsewhere, the Seahawks are seven-point favorites against the Cardinals and the Chargers are three-point favorites against the Steelers on Sunday Night Football in a game with an over-under of 44.5.SportsLine's proven computer model is backing the Under (49.5) in 49ers vs. Rams and is also targeting the Seahawks and Steelers to cover the spread in their respective matchups. Claim the latest bet365 bonus code here:Check out our bet365 promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, has generated a betting profit of over $2,000 for $100 players on its top-rated college spread football picks.

Bet it at bet365 here:\nUnder 49.5 in 49ers vs. RamsThese division rivals have gone Under in nine of their last 12 meetings in San Francisco, including a 12-6 final last December in a game that had an over/under of 48.5. They combined for 49 points when they met in Los Angeles on Oct. 2, but the total closed at 43.5 points in that matchup, and it took overtime to get to 49. Given the 49ers' slew of injuries on both sides of the ball and the inflated total compared to their first meeting of the year, the model has the Under cashing in 63% of simulations. Bet 49ers vs. Rams at bet365 here:  Seahawks -6.5 vs. CardinalsSeattle has dominated this rivalry in recent years, going 9-1 straight up and 8-2 against the spread in the last 10 meetings. The Seahawks have won the last three games at home by 10 points, and they are riding a three-game winning streak entering this contest. Arizona continues playing without starting quarterback Kyler Murray (foot), so the model has Seattle covering 56% of the time. Bet Seahawks vs. Cardinals at bet365 here:  Steelers +2.5 vs. ChargersThis has been another lopsided series of late, with Pittsburgh winning 11 of the last 15 matchups and covering the spread in seven of the last eight meetings hosted by the Chargers. Los Angeles could be without three starters along the offensive line, which does not bode well against a Pittsburgh defense that racked up 19 total pressures and five sacks in a win over Indianapolis last week. The Steelers rank second in the NFL in turnover differential, and Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert has thrown an interception in three straight games, which are all reasons why the model has Pittsburgh covering the spread in 54% of simulations. Bet Steelers vs. Chargers at bet365 here:  \nLooking for more Week 10 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Sunday.

    "body": "\n        The No. 18 USC Trojans are playing this season without star JuJu Watkins, who tore her ACL in the NCAA tournament last spring, but their first big test resulted in a gusty 69-68 win against No. 9 NC State on Sunday. The game was by no means perfect, but it showed the potential of Lindsay Gottlieb's squad and could be a confidence builder as USC takes on South Carolina next weekend.The Wolfpack is a very young group with no seniors on the roster, but it came into the 2025 Ally Tipoff game against USC on the coattails of an 80-77 win over No. 8 Tennessee in its season opener on Tuesday. Gottlieb knows the Trojans are still adjusting to the absence of Watkins and other key players from last season. However, the coach likes what she sees from her players so far.\"Everybody's sort of in a new role,\" Gottlieb said on Sunday. \"We just think it's a great opportunity for others. This is the way we want to play. We want to play fast and fluid. We're trying to play a more open, pro-style offense, where there's a lot of reads and options and putting people in different spots. We're always going to play hard and tenaciously on the defensive end and want to play fast and all the different things. \n\"And I think that's what the players bought into. But there's also different people in new roles and opportunities and that's a lot to take on. From someone in their first college game, to someone in their first time in a USC uniform being asked to take on a lot more, which is a great, awesome opportunity. I love coaching us, but I think we've got a lot of growing to do as well, which is exciting.\"After an 87-48 win against New Mexico State in their season opener and the AP Top 10 win over NC State, the Trojans are 2-0. This might not be a team ready to compete for a national championship yet, but there are some good things we have seen from the Trojans so far.Jazzy Davidson is as good as advertisedDavidson, the No. 3 player of the class of 2025, arrived in Los Angeles with high expectations due to her high basketball IQ, quickness and versatility. She has the skills of a guard, while her 6-foot-1 height helps her as a defender on the perimeter.\nShe went just 5 of 26 from the field in her first three halves as a Trojan. However, she continued helping in other ways while her shots were not falling. She properly introduced herself to college basketball in the second half against NC State, when she started 4 of 4 from the field while still maintaining her defensive intensity. The freshman, who is mentored by Watkins, did a little bit of everything in the Trojans' win against the Wolfpack. She scored a team-high 21 points, along with four rebounds, four assists, three steals and five blocks. \"I'm just blessed with amazing coaches and teammates,\" Davidson said on Sunday. \"They really keep me grounded in situations like that, when my shots are not falling as much as I'd like it to, and I'm just really grateful for them.\"\nLondynn Jones might be an X factorX factor, spark, call it whatever you want. The fact is that UCLA transfer Londynn Jones has been impactful in her first two games as a Trojan. Against NMSU, Jones went 0 for 3 from beyond the arc but still shot over 54% from the field to contribute 16 points. On Sunday, she scored 19 points while being the spark that kept USC competitive in the first half when hardly anybody else could buy a shot.Jones was a starter with the Bruins but has so far come off the bench for the Trojans. During the 2023-24 season, Jones set UCLA's single-season record for 3-pointers made with 87. She hasn't been the most efficient shooter in her college career --- she hasn't had a season in which she shoots over 37% from the field or averaged more than 12 points per game -- but the potential for her to make a significant impact on this roster is certainly there. \"I think practice is never enough,\" the senior said on Sunday. \"I think that what you do in practice, you kind of see what you can work on, what you need to get better at. I think just film, we have a lot of film sessions, so just understanding that he work that's being put in. When you're putting it in work, getting the reps, it comes naturally and you don't really have to think about it.\"\nKennedy Smith is still impactful Smith started 28 games for the Trojans last season and was expected to be the team's key returner in this rebuilding year. She shot over 41% from the field as a freshman while averaging 9.5 points per game and leading the team in steals. The shots haven't been falling for her early in her sophomore year, as she has gone 7 of 26 in the first two games. Despite those struggles, she was still one of the top contributors on Sunday with 10 points and 8 rebounds. She made back-to-back layups halfway through the fourth quarter while USC was coming back from a double-digit deficit. She also got the assist for Davidson's game winner. \"I think what makes Kennedy such an elite player is that she can impact the game without scoring,\" Gottlieb said. \"We know she's capable of scoring, and I think she had a couple of really critical buckets down the stretch. But she's unique in that she makes other elite players better. She could have the ball in her hands and feel the defense and spray it. \n\"She can score inside and out and we know she's capable of making shots, and those shots will fall. But she's taking on a lot more in only her sophomore year, trying to get the ball to be a playmaker and a shot distributor and scorer. But she's elite defensively, she's all over the boards. And just a competitiveness about her that I think other people are like, 'okay, we can get a stop. We can make a play no matter what's happening on the offensive end.'\"\n            ",

Stroud (concussion), Davis Mills and company were struggling, and the Jaguars were cruising; Mills had been intercepted on the third play from scrimmage, and after Travis Etienne punched in a 6-yard touchdown late in the third quarter, it looked like it would be a straightforward win for Jacksonville.Then the tides turned. Mills threw touchdowns to Jayden Higgins and Dalton Schultz, and the Texans forced three and outs following both drives. Down 29-24, Mills produced a 14-yard touchdown run to give the hosts an improbable 30-29 lead. It was his first touchdown run since 2022.Things got even crazier. The Jaguars got the ball back with 31 seconds left, and Trevor Lawrence appeared to move Jacksonville into field goal range with a completion to Parker Washington inside Houston territory. But Chuma Edoga was called for hands to the face, putting the visitors in true dire straits: at their own 35-yard line with seven seconds left.Then this happened:\nRankins is the only player 300+ pounds to score a touchdown in franchise history, and he's now done so twice; he also had a scoop and score with Houston in 2023.\n            \n    ",

He won the Wyndham Championship in August 2004 for his first PGA Tour title.Rory McIlroy started the back nine at Yas Links with five straight birdies and closed with a 62, matching his low score on the European tour. He wound up one shot behind, but expanded his lead in the Race to Dubai that concludes next week.Fleetwood was aiming for a third title worldwide in what already has been a memorable season that included a 4-1 record in a winning Europe Ryder Cup team. He holed a 15-foot birdie putt on the 16th and made a 15-foot par putt to stay tied with Rai on the 17th.\nBoth narrowly missed birdie chances in regulation on the par-5 18th. Fleetwood shot 66 to join Rai on 25-under 263.They finished one shot ahead of McIlroy and Nicolai Hjogaard of Denmark, who just missed a 15-foot eagle putt on the final hole to join the playoff. He closed with a 66.\"It's hard to put into words how this feels,\" Rai said. \"It's amazing to be here.\"\nIt was a tight battle on a day for low scoring, and the 30-year-old Rai fell out of the lead when his 3-foot par putt on the 14th spun hard out of the cup. Then, he had to scramble for par on the 15th, making a 6-foot putt.But he hit 5-iron to 8 feet on the 16th for birdie to stay within one shot of Fleetwood, who holed a 15-foot birdie. Rai made from 18 feet on the par-3 17th to reach 25 under, and Fleetwood had to make his 15-foot putt for par to stay tied.The playoff became a pitch-and-putt contest as neither had the length to reach the 616-yard in two shots. Fleetwood's birdie chance missed to the right, and Rai converted.\nRai came into the week at No. 55 in the Race to Dubai and the victory moved him to No. 9 to qualify for the season-ending DP World Tour Championship next week in Dubai for the top 50. Matthew Jordan tied for 15th to earn the 50th spot.McIlroy, the defending champion next week, will be going for his seventh title as Europe's No. 1 and created a bigger cushion with his runner-up finish in Abu Dhabi.Marco Penge of England closed with a 63 to tie for ninth, but he is now 767 points behind, with 2,000 points to the winner in Dubai.\n\"I just tried to keep my foot down and make as many birdies as possible knowing that, OK, I'm trying to win this tournament but also give myself the biggest cushion possible going into Dubai next week, as well,\" McIlroy said.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 'Sunday Night Football' matchup in NFL Week 10 is a potential AFC postseason preview as the Pittsburgh Steelers visit the Los Angeles Chargers. Pittsburgh (5-3) sits atop the AFC North and is coming off upsetting the Indianapolis Colts, 27-20, on Sunday. Los Angeles (6-3) is second in the AFC West and won by the same 27-20 score over the Tennessee Titans in Week 9. These teams have alternated wins and losses over each of their last six matchups. Safety Jabrill Peppers is inactive for Pittsburgh, while L.A. will be without starting lineman Bobby Hart.Kickoff from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., is set for 8:20 p.m. ET. Pittsburgh won their last meeting in 2024, taking the home game, 20-10. Los Angeles is a 3-point favorite in the latest Steelers vs. Chargers odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 45. L.A. is at -173 on the money line (risk $173 to win $100), with Pittsburgh at +143 (risk $100 to win $143).

Their +9 turnover differential is second-best in the league, while just six teams have a worse turnover differential than the Chargers (-4). Pittsburgh's defense also stepped up in a big way in its defeat of the Colts, holding the league's top-scoring team to 13 points fewer than their season average on Sunday.On offense, Aaron Rodgers is having his best season in years as his 68.7 completion percentage is the third-best of his career, with only a pair of his MVP seasons ranking higher. He has 17 touchdown passes, compared to just five picks, and he's thrown for 10 scores across just three road games. Additionally, Pittsburgh excels on the margins as it has the best average starting field position in the NFL, and just three teams have been assessed for fewer penalty yards that the Steelers. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can winThe NFL has evolved into a passing league over the years, and few teams are as proficient, on both sides of the ball, in the air game than Los Angeles. It has the No. 6 passing offense as Justin Herbert ranks second in both passing yards and passing touchdowns. Meanwhile on defense, the Chargers rank No. 3 in defending thru the air, and only Buffalo has allowed fewer passing touchdowns.The Chargers can also take advantage of deficiencies with the Steelers, namely Pittsburgh's struggles in the ground game. The Steelers rank 30th in rushing offense and are 28th in yards per carry. However, that 30th ranking is still better than what Pittsburgh's pass defense has, as the team has been anything but a Steel Curtain. Pittsburgh is dead last in defending the pass, and it has given up at least 313 passing yards in three straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest BetMGM bonus code to get up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:How to make Chargers Steelers picksWhite has analyzed Steelers vs. Chargers   from every angle and he's leaning Under on the point total.

    "body": "\n        The second half of the 2025 regular season is officially underway in the NFL. As the calendar dives deeper into November, now is about the time when teams either sink or swim. In Week 10, we started to see a little bit of separation in some pockets of the league. In Minnesota, the Baltimore Ravens continue to claw themselves back into the playoff conversation, winning their third straight game, with the latest coming against the Vikings. Meanwhile, New England extended its lead in the AFC East not only with a win on the road over Tampa Bay, but with Buffalo's stunning loss to the Dolphins. Miami's improbable victory wasn't the only upset of the week, however, as the Saints took down the Panthers.There was plenty to digest from Sunday's action, but what are the developments that we should take seriously, and what are some that are more fluky? Below, we'll figure out which overreactions from Week 10 are just that and which are legit.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 10 winners and losers: Mike Vrabel has Patriots rolling; Panthers, Vikings sink again\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJonathan Taylor is the runaway NFL MVP favoriteOverreaction or reality: OverreactionJonathan Taylor has been sensational in 2025. Otherworldly even. He just tallied 244 yards and three touchdowns (including the game-winner in overtime) against the Falcons in Germany. Those 244 yards rushing were the most by any player in a game this season. It's also his fourth three rushing touchdown game of the year (tied for the second-most in NFL history). Speaking of touchdowns, his 15 rushing touchdowns through his first 10 games are the most since LaDainian Tomlinson did it in 2006 when he went on to win MVP. Like we said, insane. \nHowever, let's not get lost in the moment. Like it or not, the NFL MVP award is really the MV-QB award, so Taylor has a massive uphill battle to break those norms. Even if it's close, the tie will go to the quarterback.  Matthew Stafford is the true MVP favoriteOverreaction or reality: RealitySpeaking of quarterbacks and the MVP race, it's Matthew Stafford who should be looked at as the favorite coming out of Week 10. The Rams signal-caller has been nothing short of prolific. In a 42-26 bludgeoning of the 49ers, Stafford completed 24 of his 36 passes for 280 yards, four touchdowns, and zero interceptions. That is the third straight game Stafford has thrown at least four touchdowns with zero picks, making him the first quarterback to accomplish that feat in NFL history. Stafford is currently on a streak of 22 passing touchdowns without an interception, which is the second-longest streak all time. He's only looking up to Tom Brady in 2010 (26 straight), who he went on to win MVP that year. Buffalo's Super Bowl window has closedOverreaction or reality: OverreactionMaybe the most stunning result from Week 10 was the Buffalo Bills being blown out by the Miami Dolphins, 30-13. This loss was compounded by the Patriots defeating the Buccaneers on Sunday, which extended their lead in the AFC East. Now, Buffalo trails New England by two games in the win column for first place in the division, and is currently losing in the head-to-head tiebreaker. Beyond where Buffalo currently sits in the standings, the jarring result does bring questions about whether or not this team has missed its window for a championship. That would be a bit of a stretch, however. Yes, Buffalo has its deficiencies -- including at wide receiver -- but with Josh Allen under center, this team still has a championship ceiling, even if that comes via a wild-card entry. \nJaxson Dart needs to change his play style Overreaction or reality: RealityIf you watch Jaxson Dart this season, it's both entertaining and frightening whenever he tucks it and runs. The Giants' first-round rookie can dazzle with his legs, and he rushed for 66 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday. However, he also takes far too many hard hits, and once again left the contest after suffering a concussion. That put Russell Wilson under center, and New York ended up blowing a double-digit fourth-quarter lead to the Bears with him under center. This should be a lesson for the young signal caller. While his dual-threat ability makes him a tantalizing prospect, he needs to pick and choose his spots better in order to be available to his team from wire to wire. Tyler Shough is franchise QB  for SaintsOverreaction or reality: OverreactionNew Orleans notched its second win of the season on Sunday and the first under rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, logging a 17-7 victory over Carolina. In the winning effort, Shough completed 19 of his 27 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns. Those are solid numbers for the second-round pick, but is it enough to have the Saints balk at the chance of selecting a quarterback prospect atop the 2026 NFL Draft? We're not there yet. If Shough strings together a few more of these performances, the conversation can be had. Until then, however, New Orleans should continue to scout the nation for its possible QB1 of the future. Brian Daboll will be the next coach fired Overreaction or reality: RealityEntering Sunday, you may have had Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel atop the bingo card of the next NFL coach to be fired. After the upset win over Buffalo, however, he'll live to coach another week. The same may not be said for Brian Daboll. The New York Giants coach was already sitting on the hot seat, and the temperature has only continued to rise after his club's Week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears. This was yet another blown fourth-quarter lead by the Giants. Not only have they lost back-to-back games when leading by 10 or more points in the fourth quarter, but the club is now 0-4 on the road in games when leading by 10-plus points on the season overall. That's a recipe to get fired, no matter if Jaxson Dart left with an injury or not. \nSan Francisco has left the playoff conversationOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Niners were blown out by the Rams at home, and are now behind both L.A. and Seattle in the division race, along with falling to the No. 8 seed in the conference. While that's a grim picture, San Francisco is still very much in the playoff conversation. That's largely thanks to a cupcake schedule over the next month-plus where they should be favored in most, if not all, of their contests. The 49ers visit the Cardinals next week, host the Carolina Panthers in Week 12, and then face the Browns in Cleveland in Week 13. After the bye, they host the Tennessee Titans. That's a pocket where a four-game winning streak is very possible, which would suddenly put San Francisco at 10-4 heading into the final three weeks. Baltimore has entered the playoff conversationOverreaction or reality: RealitySuddenly, the Baltimore Ravens have won three games in a row and sit just a game under .500 exiting Week 10. At 4-5, they are just a game behind the Steelers for first place in the AFC North after Pittsburgh fell to the Chargers on Sunday night. They're also only a game behind Jacksonville for the final wild-card spot. Looking ahead, the Ravens face the Browns in Cleveland before back-to-back home games against the New York Jets and Cincinnati Bengals. The Ravens will likely be favored in all three of those contests and, provided they take care of business, you're looking at a 7-5 squad riding a six-game winning streak as they gear up to face the Steelers for the first time this season in Week 14. As surprising as it may have sounded when they dropped to 1-5 earlier this year, the Ravens are firmly in the playoff conversation. Steelers at risk of missing the playoffs entirelyOverreaction or reality: RealityFurther emphasizing that point above, Pittsburgh is now 5-4 and suddenly barely hanging on to first place in the AFC North. While their narrowing lead to the Ravens in the division will be the focus, there's a real threat that Mike Tomlin's club misses the playoffs entirely. They currently have a worse record than the Chargers (7-3) and the Bills (6-3). Pittsburgh has already lost the head-to-head tiebreaker with Los Angeles and will play Buffalo in Week 13. On top of that, the Kansas City Chiefs are a team currently on the outside looking in on the playoff picture that will likely jump into the fray down the stretch. With K.C. coming in, a team will need to go out, and that could end up being the Steelers, especially if Baltimore leapfrogs them in the division.\n            ",

The loss dropped the Giants to 2-8 on the season that includes an 0-6 record on the road. Dart went 19 of 29 for 242 yards against the Bears prior to leaving the game. He also made NFL history on Sunday, becoming the first quarterback to ever rush for a touchdown in five consecutive games. He ran for 66 yards and two scores prior to getting hurt. \nThe 25th overall pick in April's draft, Dart entered Sunday's game with 10 touchdown passes against just three interceptions this season. He's won two of his six starts for the Giants since replacing Wilson in the starting lineup. \nDart left Sunday's game with the Giants ahead, 17-10. The lead swelled to 10 points before the Bears rallied behind Williams, whose game-winning score came on a 17-yard touchdown run with 1:47 left.\nThe Giants lost when the offense turned it over on downs following four straight incomplete passes from Wilson, who went 3 of 7 for 45 yards in relief of Dart. He was also sacked twice as the Giants' offense gained just seven yards during Wilson's three full series of work. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NWSL will reportedly award Atlanta with an expansion team for a league-record-fee of $165 million in a bid fronted by AMB Sports and Entertainment, the owners of MLS' Atlanta United and the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, according to The Athletic,A formal announcement is expected on Tuesday, which would make the Atlanta team the 17th franchise in the NWSL. The club would begin play sometime after the 2026 season and are set to stage their home matches at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of both United and the Falcons, with a soccer capacity of 42,500. Further specifics about the team's inaugural season are not public information at this time.Mercedes-Benz Stadium has an artificial turf surface and would not be the first NWSL venue not to have a natural grass field – the Portland Thorns' and Seattle Reign's respective homes, Providence Park and Lumen Field, have artificial turf and the Boston Legacy will play their first season at Gillette Stadium. The Atlanta team, though, would be the first expansion team to receive the green light from the NWSL despite a permanent plan to play on turf.The $165 million entry continues a steady rise in expansion fees for the NWSL, who reportedly received $110 million in January from the group that owns the Denver Summit, who will join the league in 2026 alongside the Legacy. The Boston club and Bay FC, which began play in 2024, reportedly paid around $53 million each to join the NWSL.\nAtlanta's soccer historyAtlanta has emerged as a hub of American soccer in recent years, first with the introduction of Atlanta United in 2017 and now with the opening of the U.S. Soccer National Training Center next year in the suburb of Fayetteville. Much of the recent growth was fueled by Arthur M. Blank, the Home Depot co-founder who leads AMB Sports and Entertainment and made a $50 million contribution for the U.S. Soccer training center, which will bear his name.The city's professional soccer team, though, was a women's team. The Atlanta Beat played in the Women's United Soccer Association, the U.S.' first professional women's league, from 2001 to 2003, and then in Women's Professional Soccer from 2010 to 2011.The usual gathering place for soccer in Atlanta these days is at Mercedes Benz Stadium, the home of both MLS' United and the NFL's Falcons. The stadium has hosted both the U.S. men's and women's national teams on multiple occasions and most recently welcomed the USWNT in April 2024 for a 2-1 win over Japan in the SheBelieves Cup. The USWNT set their attendance record for a friendly on home soil that day, with 50,646 filling Mercedes Benz Arena to take in the victory.\nMercedes Benz Stadium will also host several games at next year's World Cup including one of the semifinals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MANCHESTER -- Maybe it won't click for Liverpool. At the very least, it is hard to see how it is not too late for this season to coalesce into a sustained defense of the Premier League crown. It isn't just the eight-point deficit to the league leaders, a gap only one less than that which looked unbridgeable for Arsenal at this stage of last season. That isn't even the half of it.The profound problem for Arne Slot now, even after a 3-0 loss at Manchester City, is that the early-season skirmishes are over, the time to work oneself into the season long since past. Most of his squad will jet off to Europe and beyond for the final international window of 2025. When they return, they will do so to a team that has not addressed the issues that have been apparent since the Community Shield. This team cannot defend its flanks. If Mohamed Salah does not play well, neither do Liverpool, who spent $100 million-plus on three attacking players to ready themselves for a new era. From front to back, those who have kept to the standards established last season number in the minority.It would be easy for Slot to point to the decisions that went against his side, chief among them the baffling decision to disallow Virgil van Dijk's well-placed header because Andrew Robertson had been making what PGMOL termed \"an obvious action\" in Gianluigi Donnarumma's vicinity. He might also ponder how different this game would have been if Cody Gakpo had turned in at the back post five minutes before Jeremy Doku got the goal this performance of the season deserved.To do so would be to focus on the discolored leaves on one tree while around him the forest burns. This game might have been different if Liverpool scored their best chance or if Michael OIiver had had a different view of Robertson's positioning. It might have been worse if Erling Haaland had taken a bit more time over an early penalty, if Doku's leg had been a little longer to meet Nico O'Reilly's peach of a cross. Four or more wouldn't have flattered City, even if the expected goals suggest otherwise. \nScrub out the missed penalty and this game looks even in xG terms. It didn't feel it in the slightest, even in a second half where Pep Guardiola was far less impressed. The hosts might not have padded out their shot stats with the Haaland and Nico Gonzalez goals, but they were breezing into the penalty box in the first half, 10 entries to Liverpool's four. A late chance for Salah might have balanced out the xG but the game had long since tilted away from this shadow of their best selves.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            And yes, Liverpool had looked like the team of old on Tuesday night in a deserved win over Real Madrid. Perhaps, in retrospect, that game would have looked very different if Conor Bradley hadn't played out of his skin or if Vinicius Junior had been a little more purposeful in his attacking. It was Bradley's misfortune Sunday to run into Doku at his most devastating, the City No. 11 completing seven take-ons (it felt like more) in the 74 minutes before Guardiola opted to call time on the bully ball. Liverpool ended this match with four.The problem wasn't Bradley. There are maybe a handful of fullbacks in world football who could have dealt with Doku in his current form. Liverpool threw two at him, but Dominik Szoboszlai was no more effective a shield. On the rare occasions where Salah did track back, you could see why Slot was so prepared to let him shade the defending last season.\nThat came with a presumption of output that can probably be parked for now. Like Liverpool as a whole, he seemed to be whirring back into life with dribble-heavy games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid, but after this match, it is still worth asking if those are the exceptions rather than the norm. Salah wasn't bad per se, he ended this game with a hand in six of Liverpool's seven shots and 0.44 of a meager 0.71 xG. He just wasn't the best footballer on the planet. That has been a problem for Slot ever since the Champions League elimination at Paris Saint-Germain's hands.He is not the only one to have dropped off. It was clear on Tuesday how effective the old midfield of Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister can be when all three were humming, but it only took Mac Allister looking leggy again for the center to lose its hold on proceedings. Meanwhile, Ibrahima Konate is not exactly having a Salah-esque contract year. If his mind has already begun drifting to the Bernabeu, he might want to consider that Real Madrid will be watching his performances this season.This, then, was a lot. And it was a lot that should be familiar to Liverpool. Opponents flying in behind their fullbacks had been a game-by-game occurrence before those back-to-back wins. Eighteen games into the season, though, those controlled and authoritative performances look like the exception, rather than the rule. They are a sign that this team can reach heights to match the best in Europe, as they could last year. What has changed in their title defense season is their ability to plumb depths no contender should be able to reach. If they are to have even a scintilla of a shot at the Premier League, this cannot happen again. The problem is, however, that it keeps on happening right now.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOS CABOS, Mexico (AP) -- Ben Griffin avoided the mistakes that slowed his two challengers Sunday and rolled in three long birdie putts for a 9-under 63 to win the World Wide Technology Championship for his third PGA Tour title of the season.Griffin two-putted for birdie on the par-5 18th at El Cardonal at Diamante for a two-shot victory. He joined Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy as the only players with at least three wins, with one of those for Griffin a team event in New Orleans.Griffin, playing for the second time since his Ryder Cup debut, ran off five straight birdies starting at No. 8. That included a 40-foot putt on the par-3 11th to tie the lead, a 25-foot putt on the 12th for his first lead and a 25-foot putt on the par-3 16th that all but sealed it.He made birdie on all four of the par 3s.\"After making a few birdies early, I kind of pushed myself a little bit harder than the past few weeks when I was in contention to kind of keep the pedal down,\" Griffin said. \"Fortunately, the putter heated up, made a lot of putts on the back nine. It was fun feeling the nerves down the stretch trying to hold things off. It was nice to make a couple down the stretch.\"\nGriffin moves to a career-best No. 9 in the world ranking.Sami Valimaki (64) and Chad Ramey (65) tied for second and picked up a valuable consolation. Valimaki started the week at No. 103 in the FedEx Cup and moved to No. 76, assuring a full card for next year. Ramey went from No. 123 to No. 89 and is likely safe to keep his card.Two tournaments remain before the top 100 in the FedEx Cup keep full status for 2026.\"These last three tournaments, only goal was to kind of keep the playing rights for the next year, so I think they should be a done deal with this finish,\" Valimaki said.\nGriffin's biggest challenge came from Garrick Higgo and Carson Young, who shared the lead going to the back nine on another day of virtually no wind.Higgo's came undone with a tee shot into a bush on No. 12 that required him to take a penalty for an unplayable lie, leading to a double bogey. He shot 68 and finished three behind.Young made a 15-foot birdie putt on the 12th and was tied with Griffin at 27 under.\nBut his approach on the 13th went left down a slope, across a cart path and into the native area. He made bogey, hit a pedestrian pitch on the par-5 14th that kept him from a good look at birdie, and then three-putt for bogey on the 15th. He shot 68 and tie for sixth.Griffin had no such issues aside from a three-putt bogey on the fifth hole. He was rock solid from there and finished at 29-under 259.And his year is not over. He is getting married next month to Dana Myeroff.\"Crazy, three wins and getting married in the same year, hard to beat,\" Griffin said.\nHiggo moved to No. 52 in the FedEx Cup, which at least locks up a spot for him to play Pebble Beach and Riviera early next season, both $20 million signature events. He has finished no worse that a tie for seventh in his four starts during the FedEx Cup Fall.\"A lot of good stuff,\" Higgo said. \"I've been in contention the last four events, so I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On Sunday, Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis L. Ortiz were indicted on charges stemming from connections to gambling. Specifically, the Department of Justice has charged the pitchers with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy.   The allegations are that each pitcher on multiple occasions manipulated pitch outcomes for the benefit of gamblers, taking money in return. Each bet in question was either regarding the velocity of a specific pitch or a ball or strike call.\n        \n            \n                Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase, Luis L. Ortiz indicted for allegedly rigging pitches in MLB betting scheme\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe pitchers, who were already suspended and under MLB investigation, are facing up to 65 years in prison if convicted on all counts.In terms of MLB moving forward, the league will face plenty of questions with its gambling partnerships and how to try and prevent something like this ever happening again.\nHere are some solutions. 1. Let this case serve as a deterrent Clase was set to make $4.9 million this season, $6.4 million next season and had $20 million worth of options for the 2027 and 2028 seasons. He allegedly took kickbacks of roughly $5,000 at a time. His MLB career is likely over and he's facing a long prison sentence. Was it really worth it to risk your livelihood and freedom for a small fraction or your future income? How ridiculous to just flush your life down the toilet like that.One would help any players thinking of future gambling entanglements would be smarter than this. MLB already banned or suspended four players last year for illegal gambling, but none were accused of throwing their own games. Surely reverberations are felt throughout baseball with this case and any player even thinking about doing something similar will think twice.2. Continue to stay vigilant Something that could get lost in the shuffle here is that MLB has strict protocols and players getting caught means the system worked. If this was rampant and a bunch of players were getting away with it, we could suggest the league was asleep at the wheel and needs to wake up. Instead, the guardrails in place did their job. \nCasey Brett, Major League Baseball's senior vice president of business operations, told CBS Sports the following in 2023 and said the following: \"[Sports books] are required to help us with investigations and notify us if they feel like some sort of fishy information is happening. Like if a large amount of money was placed on this event that doesn't make sense, they are required to exchange that information,\" he said.\"...Are we ever going to get comfortable? No. If we get comfortable, we leave ourselves susceptible. I feel like we've built a really, initially, good platform to protect the integrity of the game, and it's solid, but we're going to continue to invest in the space. I don't think there's ever any amount of investment that is too much to protect.\" \nIf anything, the cases of Clase and Ortiz will only make MLB more vigilant in monitoring gambling activity along with the sports books. 3. Work with sports books to eliminate betting on pitchesGiven that this is a team sport with a litany of individual plays pieced together over the course of roughly three hours, 162 times per team per season, team-level fixing is incredibly difficult nowadays. Individual battles, however, can be thrown. A player could pretty easily strike out on purpose, for example.   Or, as is alleged in this case, a pitcher could control his velocity and throw balls on purpose. It's a pretty easy argument to say that there's simply no need to allow betting on whether or not a pitch will be a ball or a strike. Compare the upside (fan entertainment, making money, etc.) to the downside (what just happened with these two pitchers) and it seems like a no-brainer for MLB to urge all the sports books to simply not offer bets on individual pitches.\n4. Eliminate prop bets altogetherThis takes it one step further. Just eliminate all bets on individual players and limit things to team-level wagers like which team will win and/or how many runs will be scored.5. Sever all ties with gambling communityThere will be calls for this. There already have been, which means a scandal only makes the complaints louder. It is not happening, at least not now. Like it or not, a dozen or so pitches with bad gambling activity is a black eye, not the type of scandal that would get to the point of the league needing to do something so drastic, especially given that the players got caught and no games appear to have been adversely affected. Will it get worse? We can't know that. Plenty of people will say, yes, it's only going to get worse and MLB needs to cut this thing off before it does. As things stand, though, everyone is making too much money with high fan engagement to consider this option.\n            ",

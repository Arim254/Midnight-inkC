    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule begins on Saturday with Boise State vs. Washington (-10). Even with the postseason landscape rapidly changing, college football bowl confidence pools remain popular, and there are 39 matchups to make college football bowl confidence picks on this season. The two biggest spreads are in the CFP First Round as Oregon is favored by 21.5 points over James Madison, while Ole Miss is a 17.5-point favorite over Tulane. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting an upset could help you separate from the pack.Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-4.5), Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4.5), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+4.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). The Wolverines will operate under interim head coach Biff Poggi after dismissing Sherrone Moore. The college football odds give you an idea of what sportsbooks deem as favorites and underdogs, but you'll need more than just those when making bowl confidence bets.

Not only is this game in Texas, but it's in Houston, providing the obvious home-field advantage for the Cougars, as LSU has lost its last four games outside of Tiger Stadium. Meanwhile, the Cougars are 5-1 straight-up when favored this season, and the Tigers' offense limps into this matchup as it has a total of four touchdowns over the last four games and won't have quarterback Garrett Nussmeier. That's the same number that Houston had in its last game, alone, as the model has the Cougars winning in 80% of simulations. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: No. 16 USC (-5.5) gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing nearly 70% of the time. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game. There are 11 teams that win at least 70% of the time, so you need to go big on those matchups, as well as 15 underdogs that win outright. You can get all the model's picks at SportsLine.So who wins every college football bowl game, and which matchups should you assign the most confidence points to?

    "body": "\n        It's the most wonderful time of the year. That time, of course, is College Football Playoff season, and the 12-team bracket kicks off on Friday, Dec. 19, with an all-SEC matchup: No. 9 seed Alabama at No. 8 Oklahoma squaring off for a spot in the quarterfinals.The game is a rematch of one played in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Nov. 15. In that matchup, the Sooners overcame a punchless offense by forcing three turnovers to pull off a 23-21 upset. That victory helped Oklahoma (10-2) end the season on a four-game winning streak, which included three wins over ranked teams. Meanwhile, Alabama (10-3) is coming off a listless 28-7 loss to Georgia in the SEC Championship Game and had to sweat out the CFP selection committee's bracket reveal.Bet the College Football Playoff, including Oklahoma vs. Alabama, at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets. Click here to sign up:The winner of Friday's rematch between the Sooners and Crimson Tide will advance to the Rose Bowl for a CFP quarterfinal matchup against the No. 1-ranked Indiana Hoosiers.Top sportsbooks have made Alabama a 1.5-point favorite over Oklahoma. The line originally opened as a pick 'em.So what should you make of that line movement? Is it a market correction or an overreaction? Here's a look at the Sooners-Crimson Tide point spread, as well as the line movement of the three other CFP games. All times Eastern.No. 9 Alabama at No. 8 Oklahoma (8 p.m. Dec. 19)Open: Pick 'emCurrent: Alabama -1.5The season's first College Football Playoff game opened as a pick 'em at Circa but has remained steady after some initial betting. Considering that Sooners beat the Crimson Tide one month ago in Tuscaloosa, the fact that Oklahoma is an underdog in this game is telling. Alabama outgained Oklahoma 406 yards to 212 and had a 95% win expectancy in that game but was done in by three turnovers. What are the odds the Sooners will force three turnovers again? This line movement seems like a reasonable market correction.Bet College Football Playoff games at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets. Click here:No. 10 Miami at No. 7 Texas A&M (noon Dec. 20)Open: Texas A&M -4Current: Texas A&M -3.5This line opened at -5.5 in some places but has moved in favor of the Hurricanes (10-2). This likely is a reaction to the Aggies' last game, a 27-17 loss at No. 16 Texas, which really put A&M's season in a different light; the Longhorns were the only SEC team in the top half of the conference standings that the Aggies (11-1) played. A&M's best win this season, by far, came against Notre Dame, but Miami beat the Irish, too. The -3.5 seems fair, but Hurricanes backers shouldn't delay as betting trends don't suggest this line will return to its opening line barring an injury. Bet College Football Playoff games at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens. Click here to get started:No. 11 Tulane at No. 6 Ole Miss (3:30 p.m. Dec. 20)Open: Ole Miss -16Current: Ole Miss -17.5This is another rematch of a game played earlier this season. On Sept. 20, the Rebels blew out the Green Wave 45-10 in Oxford in a game that wasn't as close as the final score suggests. Ole Miss outgained Tulane 548 yards to 282 and led 45-3 that day before giving up a meaningless touchdown with 3:42 left in the game. That 35-point margin is certainly a major reason why the early money came in on Ole Miss (11-1) despite the Rebels losing coach Lane Kiffin to LSU. Obviously bettors don't believe Kiffin is worth 19 points on the point spread over new coach Pete Golding. If you agree with the bettors that Ole Miss will not regress without Kiffin, you should jump on this number now as it's only likely to go up.No. 12 James Madison at No. 5 Oregon (7:30 p.m. Dec. 20)Open: Oregon -20Current: Oregon -21.5This is the kind of game in which the Ducks usually roll. Since Dan Lanning took over as coach in 2022, Oregon is 10-0 against non-major conference teams with an average margin of victory of 36.3 points per game. However, this game may be a little different. First, James Madison is not your run-of-the-mill Group of Five team. The Dukes can run the ball (245.8 rushing yards per game, sixth in the country) and stop the run (76.2 rushing yards allowed per game, second in the nation). Also, even if this game gets out of hand, will the Ducks want to keep running their starters out there knowing they have a quarterfinal matchup against Texas Tech ahead? Oregon deserves to be a big favorite, but a backdoor cover is a possibility.\n            ",

Yahoo Sports was first to report the news on Friday night. A final decision on the move is expected in the next few weeks.\"To date, the RedBird ecosystem has delivered over $145 million of contracted revenue to the Big 12 and its member institutions,\" the Big 12 said in a statement to Yahoo. \"This partnership would provide the Conference with a world-class strategic and capital partner, while preserving 100% of the member institutions' equity in the Big 12.\"Earlier this week, Utah, a member of the Big 12, finalized a landmark private equity partnership with New York-based firm Otro Capital that will help generate an estimated $500 million for the school. That deal, which would be the first of its kind in college athletics, is expected to be finalized in early 2026.Last year, CBS Sports reported that Big 12 members were considering a first-of-its-kind private equity investment to ensure the league's long-term financial and competitive security. On the table was a possible cash infusion of $800 million to $1 billion from Luxembourg-based CVC Capital Partners in exchange for a 15% to 20% stake in the league.\nThe Big 12 isn't the only conference considering private equity. CBS Sports confirmed in October that the Big Ten is considering an enormous equity deal, potentially worth upwards of $2 billion. The deal would also extend the Big Ten's grant of rights until 2046.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Angel Reese is taking part in training camp with USA Basketball this weekend, and during her media session on Friday she stated that she will remain with the Chicago Sky despite a tumultuous end to the 2025 WNBA season. \"I'm under contract, so yes, I plan on returning to the Sky,\" Reese told reporters during her first interview since September. \"I'm continuing to talk to Tyler and building that relationship with Jeff and Tyler,\" she added, referring to Sky head coach Tyler Marsh and general manager Jeff Pagliocca. Reese is under contract through 2027, when the Sky have a team option, but there has been plenty of speculation about her future. The two-time All-Star did not play in the team's final four games due to a combination of injury and suspensions (both team and league issued), and gave a controversial interview to the Chicago Tribune, in which she aired her frustrations with the front office, coaching staff and roster construction, and called for major moves in free agency. \n\"I'm not settling for the same shit we did this year,\" Reese said. \"We have to get good players. We have to get great players. That's a non-negotiable for me.\"I'm willing and wanting to play with the best. And however I can help to get the best here, that's what I'm going to do this offseason. So it's going to be very, very important this offseason to make sure we attract the best of the best because we can't settle for what we have this year.\"Reese also made comments about specific players, and at one point expressed concern about Courtney Vandersloot's age. \n\"We can't rely on Courtney to come back at the age that she's at,\" Reese said. \"I know she'll be a great asset for us, but we can't rely on that. We need someone probably a little younger with some experience, somebody who's been playing the game and is willing to compete for a championship and has done it before.\"\n        \n            \n                Sky fall: How Angel Reese has been pushed to her limit in two seasons and what's next in Chicago\n                \n                    Lindsay Gibbs                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nVandersloot responded publicly, saying her \"age is absolutely not a factor\" and stated her plan to return to the Sky in 2026. Reese later apologized, both privately and publicly, to her teammates and said her comments were \"taken out of context.\" The organization eventually suspended Reese for the first half of the team's game against the Las Vegas Aces on Sept. 7; she had already been suspended by the league for the game on Sept. 5 against the Indiana Fever for accumulating too many technical fouls. \nReese sat out of the second half on Sept. 7 due to a back injury and missed the team's final two games of the season due to the issue. She later opted out of her exit interview, as did Vandersloot and Ariel Atkins. \"I am very vocal about what we need and what I want,\" Reese said in her interview with the Tribune. \"I'd like to be here for my career, but if things don't pan out, obviously I might have to move in a different direction and do what's best for me.\"While that comment inititally seemed like a nod at leaving in free agency one day, the events that transpired after the interview led many to wonder if she would request a trade this offseason. Reese made it clear Friday that she will not force her way out of town. \n\n        \n            \n                Chicago Sky offseason outlook: What's next for Angel Reese and Co. after a disastrous 2025 campaign\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's great news for the Sky, who are trying to forge a path forward after a disastrous 2025 season. Despite making a number of win-now moves -- most notably, trading the No. 3 pick (Sonia Citron) and a 2027 first-round swap to the Washington Mystics for Atkins -- the Sky went 10-34, tied the single-season losses record and missed the playoffs for the second season in a row. The Sky have the No. 5 pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft and, like every team, will have plenty of cap and roster space to make moves this offseason once a new collective bargaining agreement is in place. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Utah coach Kyle Whittingham is stepping down from his post, the school announced on Friday. Whittingham, 66, has been Utah's coach since 2005 and has been with the program as a position coach since 1994.\"The time is right to step down from my position as the head coach at the University of Utah,\" Whittingham said in a statement. \"It's been an honor and a privilege to lead the program for the past 21 years, and I'm very grateful for the relationships forged with all the players and assistant coaches that have worked so hard and proudly worn the drum and feather during our time here.\"The opportunity to guide so many talented young men as they pursued their goals -- both on and off the field -- has truly been a blessing. Thank you to the university, the Salt Lake community, all of Ute Nation and most of all my wife and family for your unwavering support that has helped make Utah Football what it is today.\"Whittingham, who began his tenure at Utah 32 years ago as defensive line coach under Ron McBride, took over for Urban Meyer in 2005 after the Utes completed a 12-0 season and won the 2005 Fiesta Bowl in dominant fashion over Pittsburgh. He went 177-88 overall across 21 seasons, overseeing Utah's transition from the Mountain West into the Power Five when it joined the Pac-12 in 2011 and again transitioned into the Big 12 in 2024.\nThough there were disappointing seasons, Whittingham led the Utes to eight double-digit win campaigns, including four of the last seven seasons. The Athletic reported that Whittingham is not retiring from coaching and could seek other coaching opportunities. The Utes are set to face Nebraska on Dec. 31 in the Las Vegas Bowl, which will be the final game of Whittingham's coaching career with the program. Under Whittingham, Utah finished with a winning record in 18 of his 21 seasons as the coach.Scalley set to take over for Whittingham CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported that Whittingham has informed some internally at Utah that the program is set to name defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley as the school's new coach. Scalley, 46, has been with the Utah program since 2007, when he started his coaching career as a graduate assistant.\nScalley has been the defensive coordinator/safeties coach at his alma mater since 2016. Last summer, Utah officially named Scalley as the head coach in waiting. Scalley was a finalist for the 2019 Broyles Award, given annually to the top assistant coach in college football, after Utah boasted the nation's top run defense.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For at least one day, Liverpool were able to look past their turmoil after defeating Inter 1-0 in Champions League play on Tuesday. Fans chanting Arne Slot's name showed a shift from backing Mohamed Salah in his current power struggle to supporting the manager who is tasked with leading the Reds through this rough patch in their form. They've shown glimpses in the Champions League, but sitting 10th in the Premier League behind rivals Everton and a newly promoted Sunderland, this hasn't followed the Reds into the Premier League.How to watch Liverpool vs. Brighton, oddsDate: Saturday, Dec. 13 | Time: 10 a.m. ETLocation: Anfield -- Liverpool, EnglandLive stream: PeacockOdds: Liverpool -150; Draw +320; Brighton +370As the team returns to domestic play on Saturday, focus shifts back to Salah as this could be his final game for Liverpool, and there's no guarantee that he'll even feature. Salah will be released for the Africa Cup of Nations to compete with Egypt on Dec. 15, following this match facing Brighton, and with a run that could take him to Jan. 18 if Egypt makes it to the final of the competition, the transfer window could be wide open upon his return.Slot didn't offer much clarity as to whether Salah would get to make an appearance against Brighton, but that also does make sense as this is a developing situation by the hour, let alone the day.\"Salah in our out against Brighton? I will speak to Mo in the next few hours, and this conversation will determine all next steps,\" Slot said in his prematch press conference before facing Brighton.While it's hard to see a way back for Salah after he went on record stating that someone at the club wants to push him out and that he's been thrown under the bus, it's also true that Liverpool wouldn't have many suitors for the Egyptian star in January. According to the Athletic, those discussions were positive and will see Salah return to the Liverpool squad for facing Brighton before departing for AFCON.\nConsidering potential transfers, if San Diego FC can't enter the picture, it could be a trip to the Saudi Pro League or bust for Salah. It'd be a tall task for another European side to meet Salah's salary demands, but there's also the case that Liverpool would want a transfer fee for Salah. With the 33-year-old on the wrong side of the aging curve and only having five goals and three assists all season while failing to register a goal contribution in seven consecutive matches, it's hard to see why someone would see that and decide to roll the Brinks truck up to Anfield to secure his signature -- not to mention that Salah put all his cards on the table, far from the best transfer strategy.Liverpool were going to need to eventually think about life without Salah, but it wasn't something that was the plan one year removed from winning the title; however, this season does provide them with an opportunity to plan for that. Even if Salah doesn't depart in January, Liverpool are already 10 points off the pace of Arsenal atop the league, the title race may not be over for Liverpool, but this is also a time when their best opportunities for silverware will come in the Champions League and cups.Knocking off Inter and Real Madrid in European play, there's no reason that Liverpool can't win the Champions League despite their domestic struggles. The Premier League can be a ground for figuring out what the best configuration is to do that as while they'll want to get back into a European place in the table, even with rotation, there's enough talent in the squad to do it. The Inter win saw Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak lead the line together, and more experimentation will be needed. \nLast season, Salah running hot and scoring 29 goals and assisting 18 more was enough to lead Liverpool to the title, but with that form out of the equation, Slot has a big question to answer on how to replace them. The expectation was that Isak would continue his own Premier League form after consecutive seasons of scoring 20 or more goals with Newcastle United but it has actually been Ekitike who has been the more effective of the forwards with seven goals and two assists in all competitions. It's far too early to say that Isak won't be a good fit at Liverpool, but the time is now for Slot to figure out how to get the best out of the Swedish striker.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Pat Spencer fits the Hollywood blueprint for an underdog sports story. Little (by NBA standards). Un-drafted. The guy didn't play college basketball until he was a fifth-year senior following a legendary lacrosse career. He played overseas. Worked his way through the Warriors' system from the ground up -- summer league to the G-League to, now, a two-way contract with the big club, for which he has turned into something of a cult hero. Over his last four games, Spencer is averaging 16 points, 5.8 assists and 4 rebounds on 59% shooting. He's made six of his last eight 3-pointers and is at 44% for the season. Not bad for a guy who couldn't shoot a lick from deep in his lone college season. Spencer has obviously put in a ton a work to get to this point. You don't have to know the fine-print details of his journey to know that he surely could've given up at many points. He never did. And now here he is, a driving force behind Golden State salvaging a 3-2 record -- which was seconds away from being 4-1 -- over a five-game stretch without Stephen Curry.  Warriors fans are losing their collective mind over this guy, and it's understandable. Spencer is on his own little version of a Linsanity run at the moment, barking out \"I'm that motherf---er\" in Philadelphia one night:\nWaving goodbye to the Cleveland crowd the next:\nSpencer is understandably feeling himself, and his game, and more importantly so is Steve Kerr, the man in control of the minutes. Kerr put Spencer into the starting lineup against the Cavs, and he responded with 19 points, seven assists and three rebounds in what was a huge win over an expected title contender without Curry, Jimmy Butler or Draymond Green in uniform. The Warriors were, and for all intents and purposes still are, treading water for their playoff life in what is, as expected, a murderous Western Conference. When Curry found himself sidelined for two weeks, there was a real chance he was going to come back to a sub-.500 team. Instead, he's expected back on Friday night vs. the Timberwolves and suddenly the 13-12 Warriors, after a much-needed three-day break without a game, feel like a team with some juice behind them again. Give Spencer his flowers. He played a major part in this little turnaround, and he's going to keep playing a part (we'll see how major it is) even as the Warriors' stars return to full health. \n\"We'll have to find out,\" Kerr said earlier this week on 95.7 The Game when asked what Spencer's role will look like with Curry back. \"I'm not going to take away all his minutes, I can tell you that. I'm definitely going to play him with Steph some. Some of it will depend on matchups. How well we can hold up defensively. ... But the way Pat is playing, the way he's impacting winning, the way he's impacting just the competitive spirit of the team, I have to keep playing him.\"Here's where it gets interesting, because up until these past few weeks everything Spencer has given the Warriors has been gravy. For the most part, he was a cheerleader with a mustache. Now he's set a higher standard, and that comes with expectations. Expectations, as a league scout said to me a few years back, are the root of frustration. I loved that line. I use it all the time. It's so true. Particularly for NBA role players. Just look at a guy like Brandin Podziemski, who has become the punching bag of Warriors Twitter. People make it like the Warriors are a Little League team and Podz is only playing because Kerr is his dad. Like he doesn't even belong on an NBA court. \nIt's ridiculous. Podziemski has been a winning player pretty much from the that instant he arrived in Golden State. As a rookie, the Warriors outscored their opponents by 5.3 points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor, per Cleaning the Glass. Last year, that number rose to plus-6.8, and when you filter out the small-sample stuff and look at only the Podz lineups that logged at least 50 possessions together, the Warriors were plus-22.6 with Podz playing. This year the inclusive number doesn't look so great but it's still a positive at plus-0.8, and again, the nine lineups with which Podziemski has logged at least 20 possessions are, on average, plus-10.5 per 100. \nThis is not a coincidence. Podziemski isn't perfect, but at his best he's a Josh Hart type of player to which all the things that add up to winning can be tied. On energy alone he's super valuable. He's an elite positional rebounder. He's always at the top of the league in charges taken. On a team that, collectively, struggles to create downhill pressure, he actually gets into the paint. Every season Podziemski's scoring numbers have gotten better on almost identical minutes. He's currently shooting 40% on five 3-pointers per game. This is a guy who makes things happen, plain and simple. If you think he hasn't put together stretches like this one Spencer is on right now, you're crazy. \nThe problem is the heightened expectations that have been placed on Podz, in part because of showings like this, There's also the commitment Kerr has shown to letting him to play through mistakes when other young players haven't been afforded the same freedom, which annoys fans when they watch him dribble himself dizzy and head-fake his way into bad shots and turnovers.\nAnd let's not forget the absolutely crazy expectations Podziemski put on himself when, prior to the season, he basically told Nick Friedell of The Athletic that he wants, and on some level expects, to be the player to whom Curry eventually hands the keys to the franchise. There's confidence and there's delusion, and if Podziemski honestly thinks he's the next franchise player, he's leaning heavily toward the latter. But that's just perception stuff. The reality is this: If Spencer were to put up Podziemki's numbers over a 100-plus-game sample, it would be regarded as a massive success. For Podziemski, even as he has had plenty it leaves you wanting more. Expectations are the root of frustration. Let Spencer play real minutes in a lot of real games. Let him feel the heat of postseason possessions with the ball in his hands. This isn't suggest that what Spencer has achieved these past few weeks has been a fluke. Any time he's gotten any minutes he has shown, increasingly, that he can play. He has almost surely made himself millions of dollars on his next deal. He might actually be better suited to initiate offense than Podziemski, who is at his best off the ball, attacking gaps against defenses in motion and can get himself into trouble trying to create too much chaos on his own. \nSpencer knows his role in this way. He organizes. Keeps the ball and flow moving. That's why Kerr wants to play him alongside Curry, because he's a natural for possessions designed to run through a maze of off-ball movement until the greatest shooter ever eventually pops into the open, whereas Podz is sometimes apt to get a little impatient if he's give control of the ball. In a perfect world the fans won't need to pit these guys against one another, but it's true that they do serve some of the same functions and may, if Spencer keeps this up, be in competition for minutes. Against OKC, Kerr subbed out Spencer, who was playing brilliantly as Golden State was in position to pull off a major upset without Curry and Butler (who left the game in the first half) against the best team in the league, at the 3:56 of the fourth quarter for Podziemski, and from that point forward the Warriors went from a four-point deficit to a 12-point loss. Kerr talked about the decision afterward and noted that it was a tough call because \"both guys really played great games.\" \nIt's true. Both Podziemski and Spencer finished with 17 points. Spencer added six assists. Podziemski hit three of his five 3s and was 6-of-11 overall. And yet, fans were fuming that Kerr would dare put Podz back in the game. Spencer is their guy right now. Half of them wanted Podz traded a long time ago and remain annoyed by the organization's two-timeline approach, of which Podziemski is a core part. Spencer, meanwhile, can do no wrong at the moment. Give it some time. With enough exposure, all role players show their flaws. That's why they're role players. The only difference here is that Spencer knows he's a role player. Hell, it took a potential career-changing four-game run to even be considered that. He hasn't shouldered any real expectations yet, but they're coming. Let's see what he does with them. \n            ",

The Midshipmen (9-2) and Black Knights (6-5) each beat Air Force this season to set up a winner-take-all showdown as the annual round-robin between the service academies concludes with the 126th edition of the Army vs. Navy Game.Navy won last year's battle 31-13 to take hold of the trophy and snap a two-game losing streak against Army. The Black Knights will be hankering for revenge and entering with some momentum after bouncing back from a 1-3 start to win five of their past seven. Navy also enters with some wind at its back after beating AAC stalwarts South Florida in Memphis in its past two games. Another victory would give the Midshipmen back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time in program history with a bowl game still ahead. Navy is led once again by star quarterback Blake Horvath, a multi-dimensional senior who has already surpassed 1,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing. Army's attack is led by quarterback Cale Hellums, who enters with 1,078 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. \n        \n            \n                2025 Army vs. Navy Game uniforms: Black Knights, Midshipmen will honor 250 years of service in 126th meeting\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn the NIL era and mass transfer era, this storied rivalry has become even more distinct than ever before.

Navy quarterback Blake Horvath totaled more than 300 yards and four touchdowns, shining as both a runner and passer while putting an exclamation point on a breakout season. His 52-yard touchdown pass midway through the third quarter to Eli Heidenreich put Navy ahead 21-10 and proved to be a critical blow.Army's tribute: Army is commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's existence by wearing special uniforms that will include purple streaking through the numbers and helmet. It's meant as a tribute to the sacrifices of those who served. The uniform's color will be a marble tint that is designed to symbolize \"the enduring foundation of strength that the American people have provided for the Army.\" The helmets feature the year \"1775\" spelled out on the back.\nNavy's uniform story: Navy's uniform was inspired by the USS Constitution, which is the only remaining frigate from the Navy's original fleet. The vessel known as \"Old Ironsides\" was once used as floating classroom space in the 19th century. It has been out of service since 1881. The \"Old Ironsides\" nickname cam in the War of 1812 when the USS Constitution went undefeated in battle.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- The murkiness surrounding Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs (knee) and the Dallas Cowboys amid his extended injured reserve stint is beginning to clear. He spoke to the media for the first time in weeks, and the 2021 NFL interceptions leader said he is ready to play and expects to play on \"Sunday Night Football\" against the Minnesota Vikings. Dallas officially lists Diggs as questionable to play on Sunday after being limited in practice all week. \"I'm ready though,\" Diggs said. \"I think our intensity level to make this playoff push and play for each other [led to a great week of practice]. ... \"I feel really healthy. I feel really healthy this time around, so I'm just going to go out there, give it 100% that I can and we'll see what happens.\"Dallas ruled Diggs out the Friday before Week 7 against the Washington Commanders after the cornerback suffered a concussion in an accident at his home. When Diggs was in concussion protocol, the Cowboys placed him on injured reserve because of his knee being reaggravated, and he hasn't played since, missing the last seven games. \nThe team opened Diggs' 21-day practice window to work his way back to a return from injured reserve on Nov. 30, and he has until Dec. 20 at 4 p.m., the day before the Cowboys' Week 16 home finale against the Chargers, to be activated. Otherwise, Diggs would remain on IR and not return to play this season. His situation began to take an intriguing turn with the team not activating him from IR last week or indicating throughout the direction of this week that Diggs would be ready to play. For the last two weeks, he has looked as spry as another Cowboys cornerback in the media viewing portion of practice. Diggs playfully chased a teammate across Dallas' locker room after a practice this week with plenty of speed. \"It's hard, it's definitely been hard,\" Diggs said when talking about his extended absence. \"People feel how how they feel. You just got to roll with the punches and keep pushing forward.\"Head coach Brian Schottenheimer's Friday comments on Diggs' situation were the most upbeat they've been across the last few weeks. \"Consistency\" and doing \"everything the right way\" have been Diggs' prescribed keys to return to action the last two weeks. \n\"Doing well, having a good week. We'll see how today goes, and again excited to see how he finishes the week,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said before practice on Friday. ... \"Well number one, I don't just talk about that [consistency] with Trevon. I talk about the word consistency in a lot of things. It's my favorite word that I use with you guys. Why? Because to sustain success and win in this league, you need to be consistent. So, it just means doing things right all the time, and that's everybody. It's not just about Trevon.\"The 27-year-old began fully trusting his knee as recently as last week, but given the emphasis on consistency from Schottenheimer, defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus and the rest of the coaching staff, he understood why he didn't get activated for Week 14 at the Detroit Lions. \"Last week. Yeah, last week I felt good to play. I didn't get a lot of practice though, so that could also be the issue,\" Diggs said. \"I feel like I got a lot of reps in this week and a lot of practice in. It's going to be a good week.\"\nQuarterback Dak Prescott served as the conduit between Diggs and the coaching staff at times, providing him both words of encouragement and direct feedback from the coaches about what they would like to see from him in order to return to the active roster.  \"I would say my role that's come in is more of just being optimistic, being the motivator in that sense. Knowing what he's been going through, knowing how much he wants to play and thinking that he may have been called up or got back last week and then didn't, for whatever the reason,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"Just being able to talk to him, being a sounding board and honestly giving him real, honest feedback. Not just what he wants to hear, but probably 'this is what the coaches are thinking, this is what you've presented, this is what you've given them and this is the best way that I can see it.' He's growing. He's growing each and every day in every aspect of it. Excited for him just to continue to get healthy and get back to the guy that he's confident in being and going and making those plays.\"  Diggs' change of direction and reintegration into a defense with a number of different players -- linebacker DeMarvion Overshown, third-round rookie cornerback Shavon Revel, All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and linebacker Logan Wilson -- factored into his prolonged layoff.   \n\"I think the other thing to realize is the ramp up portion of this is real. You don't play football for four weeks, you don't forget how to play, but you also haven't moved and had to change direction,\" Schottenheimer said. \"The thing that's so crazy about our sport, you guys know this, it's not just you. It's the working alongside 10 other guys, and there's calls and communication. Things that have to be better. Once we feel like that's where we're at, then certainly we know what kind of player Trevon can be.\"\nWhen Diggs went down entering Week 7, the Cowboys were averaging 30.7 points per game, the second-most in the NFL at the time. Since Dallas acquired Williams and Wilson at the trade deadline and activated both Overshown and Revel off of IR in Week 11, the Cowboys are averaging 27.3 points per game, ranking 27th in the league in that span. Perhaps the biggest change that's come in that span is Dallas' run defense: they were allowing 142.2 rushing yards per game through the first six weeks of the season, and they are allowing just 79.5 rushing yards per game since Week 11, the second-lowest mark in the league. \"Yeah, really good. Everything's been looking like it's coming together really well, how it's supposed to,\" Diggs said of how the defense has looked of late. \"Momentum is going really well, flowing how it's supposed to. Momentum is going really well.\"\nReturning to the football field with his Cowboys teammates served as the main driver of motivation for Diggs to become healthy enough to play again in 2025. \"Just being able to go back out there with my brothers. Being able to play with those guys,\" Diggs said. \"Run around, fly around, hit people, take the ball away. Just doing everything together as a team. I feel that's the most fun part that I've missed. Just, I miss that truly.\"He acknowledged these last four games of the regular season are \"very important\" for the 6-6-1 Cowboys' dwindling playoff hopes, which currently sit at 11.9% according to CBS' SportsLine model. He \"of course\" wants to aid Dallas' playoff push. \nThe stretch run of the season could also heavily color his reputation not only in the Cowboys' organization but throughout the rest of the NFL, which could potentially matter if Dallas decides to part ways with him in the offseason. If the Cowboys opted for an offseason divorce, Dallas would save around $12.6 million in cap space if he is released before June 1 in 2026. A post-June 1 release would free up $15.5 million. Diggs' $19.4 million average per year salary on his five-year, $97 million contract is tied for the 10th-highest at the cornerback position, according to OverTheCap.com. Diggs has missed 28 games since 2023 because of knee injuries, including a torn ACL in practice in 2023. However, he isn't currently sweating the future. \"No, not really because I know who I am. I know what I'm capable of. I'm not having a crisis of not knowing. I know how to play football. I know what skillset I have, so it's just all about showing it, putting it out there and making the plays that I always make. If it's up to Diggs, he would like to remain a Cowboy for the foreseeable future. Weeks 15-18 will certainly be quite illuminating for a player whose 20 career interceptions since entering the league as a second-round pick in 2020 are tied for the second-most in the NFL.\n\"Yeah, of course. I love Dallas. But, you know, at the end of the day, it's a business. Whatever happens, happens. I'm prepared, I'm ready for it. I would love to be here. I love everything that comes with Dallas, the fans, the relationships I've built here. But if that's not what it is, that's just not what it is.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With one game already in the books, Week 15 of the NFL season is off to an interesting start. Because all of the bye weeks are now in the rearview mirror, there are another 15 games on tap for Sunday and Monday. Luckily for football fans, most of the key players for the 30 teams still yet to take the field will be in action for those contests. But there are some who will be out and others whose statuses remain up in the air. In the space below, you'll find detailed injury reports for all 14 contests that will take place on Sunday, as well as an initial update on the key Monday night game between the Dolphins and the Steelers.All Week 15 NFL betting lines via DraftKings Sportsbook.Cleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (-7.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSBrownsDavid NjokuTEKneeOutDylan SampsonRBCalf/HandOutAdin HuntingtonDTQuadOutWyatt TellerOGCalfOutDenzel WardCBCalfOutDeshaun WatsonQBAchillesOutJoel BitonioOGKnee/BackQuestionableZak ZinterOGBackQuestionableCedric TillmanWRConcussion/RibQuestionableBearsKyler GordonCBGroinOutTravis HomerRBAnkleOutRome OdunzeWRFootQuestionableNjoku was injured while catching a touchdown pass last week but has fallen behind Harold Fannin Jr. in snaps. Sampson's absence will mean a larger role for Jerome Ford. Teller's absence and Bitonio's potential absence could hurt the Browns up front against a poor Bears defense. Ward is a key piece in the secondary and will be missed. Tillman hasn't been as large a part of the offense recently as he was early in the season but is still a valuable part of the receiver rotation.\nGordon has played in only three games this year and missed last week against Green Bay. Odunze was limited in practice throughout the week after also missing last week's game against the Packers.Baltimore Ravens at Cincinnati Bengals (+2.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSRavensRashod BatemanWRAnkleQuestionableTavius RobinsonOLBFootQuestionableAr'Darius WashingtonSAchillesQuestionableBengalsTee HigginsWRConcussionOutPJ JulesSAnkleDoubtfulShemar StewartDLKneeDoubtfulBateman was a late-week addition and then downgraded to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign. Washington practiced fully all week could be be gearing up to return from his extended stay on injured reserve.Higgins will miss his second game in the last three weeks due to a concussion. Trey Hendrickson was placed on IR and is out for the year, so missing Stewart as well would be a blow to Cincinnati up front.\nArizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSCardinalsMarvin Harrison Jr.WRHeelOutJalen ThompsonSHamstringOutParis Johnson Jr.OLKneeOutMax MeltonCBHeelOutDadrion Taylor-DemersonSAnkleOutEvan BrownOLPersonalOutBilal NicholsDLKneeOutXavier WeaverWRHamstringOutWalter NolenDLKneeQuestionableChristian JonesOLKneeQuestionableElijah HigginsTEIllnessQuestionableEmari DemercadoRBAnkleQuestionableL.J.

SpeedLBKneeQuestionableHarrison BryantTENeck/ShoulderQuestionableJustin WatsonWRCalfQuestionableHarrison is out for the second week in a row and fourth time in the last five games. The Cards are beset by injuries in the secondary and potentially along the defensive line. If Demercado misses again, they'll also remain shorthanded in the backfield after they did not activate Trey Benson from injured reserve earlier this week.If Chubb can't go, Woody Marks will again carry the load for the Texans. Bryant and Watson fully practiced on Friday while Speed was limited.New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-13.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSJetsJustin FieldsQBKneeOutFrancisco MauigoaLBNeckOutMason TaylorTENeckOutTyrod TaylorQBGroinOutAzareye'h ThomasCBShoulderOutStone SmarttTEConcussionQuestionableCam JonesLBHipQuestionableJaguarsParker WashingtonWRHipQuestionableWalker LittleOTConcussionQuestionableBrady Cook will start for New York with both Fields and Tyrod Taylor out.

Molden's potential absence could hurt on the back end while Pipkins' could force the Chargers deeper into their tackle depth. Johnston did not practice on Friday after being a full participant all week prior to that.The Chiefs have had issues getting open in recent weeks, and the absence of Brown won't help their offense get back on track. Kansas City is again incredibly banged up along the offensive line. And McDuffie's potential absence would be huge if he can't go. He was limited after suffering a knee injury during last week's game.\nBuffalo Bills at New England Patriots (+1.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSBillsChristian BenfordCBToeQuestionableTerrel BernardLBElbowQuestionableJosh PalmerWRAnkleQuestionablePatriotsTerrell JenningsRBConcussionOutRobert SpillaneLBFootQuestionableBenford was downgraded from limited on Thursday to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign for player availability. Both Bernard and Palmer were limited throughout the week.Jennings' absence will leave the backfield work to TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson. If Spillane can't go, that could hurt against a Bills offense that loves to run the ball and use multi-tight end sets to hit defenses with play-action passes.Washington Commanders at New York Giants (-2.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSCommandersJayden DanielsQBElbowOutDrake JacksonDEGroin/KneeOutJonathan JonesCBRibOutChris Rodriguez Jr.RBGroinQuestionableDeebo SamuelWRIllnessQuestionableGiantsBeaux CollinsWRNeck/ConcussionOutVictor DimukejeOLBKneeOutNic JonesCBShoulderOutRakeem Nunez-RochesDLAnkleOutKayvon ThibodeauxOLBShoulderOutJamie GillanPLeft KneeDoubtfulD.J.

The Commies could be even more shorthanded if Rodriguez and/or Samuel can't play. Rodriguez was limited throughout the week and Samuel did not practice on Friday.\nThe Giants have all kinds of issues up front on defense, which could be exacerbated if Lawrence, in particular, can't play. Lawrence was a late-week addition to the report, which is usually not a good sign. They could also be shorthanded in the special teams department without their punter and possible their primary return specialist.Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSRaidersAlex BachmanWRThumbOutKolton MillerTAnkleOutGeno SmithQBRight Shoulder/BackOutJeremy ChinnSBackQuestionableJordan MeredithC/GFootQuestionableIan ThomasTECalfQuestionableEaglesJalen CarterDLShouldersOutLane JohnsonOLFootOutKenny Pickett will start in place of Geno Smith.

McGlinchey was a late-week add and didn't practice on Friday. Bryant's absence will thrust Troy Franklin and potential Lil'Jordan Humphrey into larger roles as outside receivers.Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (-5.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSLionsBrian BranchDBAchillesOutKerby JosephSKneeOutKayode AwosikaGFootQuestionableTaylor DeckerTShoulder/RestQuestionableThomas HarperSConcussionQuestionableChristian MahoganyOLFibulaQuestionableKalif RaymondWRAnkleQuestionableSione VakiRBThumbQuestionableShane ZylstraTEKneeQuestionableRamsDavante AdamsWRHamstringQuestionableDetroit has a number of injuries in the secondary, specifically at safety, which could be a big liability against the Rams. The injuries along the offensive line could be damaging as well, against L.A.'s strong defensive front. All of their questionable players save for Decker, who didn't practice, were limited throughout the week of practices. \nAdams is listed as questionable, but Sean McVay said he expects the receiver to play.Carolina Panthers at New Orleans Saints (+2.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSPanthersN/ASaintsAlvin KamaraRBKnee/AnkleOutAsim RichardsOTAnkleOutJustin ReidSKneeQuestionableThe Panthers have a clean injury report, with zero players listed as questionable, doubtful or out. Kamara will miss his third consecutive game.

They'll also be without their right tackle in front of either Philip Rivers or Riley Leonard, whomever makes the start under center.\nIf Seattle is without both Arroyo and Saubert, that could hamper its ability to use favored multi-tight end sets. Sundell has been out since early November but got in full sessions late this week, a potential good sign for his return.Minnesota Vikings at Dallas Cowboys (-5.5)TEAMPLAYERPOSITIONINJURYSTATUSVikingsTy ChandlerRBKneeQuestionableChristian DarrisawOTKneeQuestionableCowboysTyler GuytonOTAnkleOutJadeveon ClowneyDEHamstringQuestionableTrevon DiggsCBKneeQuestionableJake FergusonTECalfQuestionableChandler is still in the 21-day window to return from injured reserve.

    "body": "\n        This week Michigan's board of regents authorized a law firm to expand its investigation into the athletic department's handling of the Sherrone Moore situation, a person familiar with the decision told CBS Sports on Friday.The law firm Jenner & Block has been tasked with the review, which the source described as an \"open-ended\" inquiry into the athletic department. CBS Sports granted the source anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation.Moore, 39, was fired with cause during a one-on-one meeting with athletics director Warde Manuel on Wednesday afternoon after evidence of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. Information on that relationship was turned over to the department that morning, sources told CBS Sports. Hours later, Moore was sitting in jail after allegedly breaking into a female staff member's home and threatening to harm himself with butter knives and scissors, according to the Washtenaw County (Mich.) Prosecutor's Office and Pittsfield Township police. \nThe Detroit News first reported Friday that Michigan's board authorized an expanded probe into the athletics department. The development follows a letter from university president Domenico Grasso to students and faculty, encouraging anyone with additional information related to Moore to contact Jenner & Block.\"This breach of trust by coach Moore is painful for many in our community, first and foremost, the individuals directly involved in this situation,\" president Domenico Grasso wrote in the letter obtained Thursday by CBS Sports. \"Yet our swift and decisive action reflects the university's staunch commitment to a campus culture of respect, integrity and accountability.\"\nMoore was detained by police Wednesday and formally charged Friday with felony home invasion, along with misdemeanor charges of stalking and breaking and entering or entering without breaking. He was released Friday afternoon on a $25,000 cash surety bond. A judge ordered the continuation of mental health treatment, imposed a GPS tether, restricted Moore from leaving the state of Michigan, and barred him from any contact with the alleged victim.Moore appeared in court Friday afternoon via video conference, wearing a white jail-issued shirt and pants, seated alone in a small room. A prosecutor said during the arraignment that Moore told the alleged victim: \"I'm going to kill myself. I'm going to make you watch. My blood is on your hands. You ruined my life.\"The prosecutor later added that the alleged victim \"was terrorized\" by Moore's behavior.\nMoore is due back in court Jan. 22 for a probable cause conference.Moore was 16-8 in two seasons leading the Wolverines. He was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach after Jim Harbaugh left for the NFL following the school's first national title since 1997. Associated head coach Biff Poggi was named interim head coach Wednesday as the university searches for Moore's replacement. Michigan (9-3) is scheduled to play Texas in the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Eve.Richard Johnson contributed to this report.\n            ",

Curry's return has one of SportsLine's top experts backing the Warriors to win as a part of Friday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook for online sports betting.The SportsLine's advanced computer model also has a Friday best bet on the NBA slate, backing the Cavaliers to cover as 14.5-point favorites against the Wizards, and another one of SportsLine's top experts has a play on No. 5 UConn vs. Texas in college basketball action. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 15 on a 50-35 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Friday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookCavaliers (-14.5) vs. WizardsTexas (+13.5) vs. UConnWarriors (-125) to defeat the TimberwolvesCombining the model's three picks into a Friday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +566 (risk $100 to win $566). Bet it at DraftKings here:\nCavaliers (-14.5) vs. Wizards (-115)The Wizards are once again one of the worst teams in the league, entering Friday with the worst record in the NBA at 3-19. The Wizards have lost three straight games, all by at least 15 points, and they are 1-4 over their last five games, with all four losses coming by at least 15 points. Even though Cleveland hasn't been as dominant as it was last year, the Cavaliers are still 14-11, and each of their last five wins has come by double-digit margins. The model views this as a significant mismatch, projecting the Cavaliers to cover even a spread this large in 68% of simulations. Back the Cavaliers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Texas (+13.5) vs. UConn (-102)\"I think we have an obvious letdown spot for UConn coming off a tremendous win against the reigning national champion Florida Gators on Tuesday night in Madison Square Garden,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"Here they get a visit from Sean Miller's first Texas team, and while the Longhorns have not fared well against top competition, they are athletic enough to do some damage with a well-executed game plan. Speaking of game plan, Miller's Xavier team played UConn tough last year and peeled off a couple wins against the eventual national champs in 2023. This spread considers Texas way too much of a pushover, given the spot and the familiarity in the coaching matchup.\" Back the Texas at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Warriors (-125) to defeat the Timberwolves\"I'm gonna take a shot here,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"Again, the NBA lines are so backward right now that I want to take any reasonable ones. Anthony Edwards is iffy for Minny. If he sits, then I believe this for sure cashes. It may anyways with Steph Curry back for the Dubs, although Draymond Green being out is not ideal. I always enjoy seeing him and Rudy Gobert just ready to rumble.\" Back the Warriors at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:\nWant more Friday NBA and college basketball picks?You've seen some of the model's Friday best bets.

For Week 15, let's go with two guys in Travis Etienne and Woody Marks. I expect both to go off in this scoring period.Let's start with Etienne, who is $6,500 on DraftKings and $7,500 on FanDuel. He's facing the Jets, who are No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. And in their past four games against the Patriots, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins, the Jets have allowed 10 total touchdowns to running backs, and six guys have scored at least 13.5 PPR points. Etienne has scored at least 15.7 PPR points in five of his past six games. He should be dominant in Week 15, and he's a great bargain at his cost.Marks is $5,600 on DraftKings and $6,500 on FanDuel. And he should have a big game against the Cardinals, who are No. 4 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs. In the past five weeks, the backfields for Seattle, San Francisco, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay, and the Rams have combined for 133 carries for 712 yards and eight touchdowns, and 19 catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns on 23 targets. \nOver that span, six running backs have scored at least 14.3 PPR points against Arizona. And Marks just scored 15.6 PPR points in Week 14 at Kansas City.I plan to play both of these running backs in several lineups this week. And I'm expecting both to go off in this scoring period.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 15, click on this link to SportsLine.

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.             What do the numbers mean?            \nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                        To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard), and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Wild have acquired superstar defenseman Quinn Hughes from the Vancouver Canucks, the teams announced on Friday. After weeks of speculation about Hughes' future, the Wild have swooped in and landed one of the NHL's best defensemen.In exchange for Hughes, Minnesota sent center Marco Rossi, winger Liam Ohgren, rookie defenseman Zeev Buium and a 2026 first-round pick back to Vancouver. That's quite the haul,  but it may be a worthwhile risk for Wild general manager Bill Guerin, who is trying to help his team hit the next level.The No. 7 overall pick in the 2018 NHL Draft, Hughes has become a top-two defenseman in the league, alongside Cale Makar of the Colorado Avalanche. Hughes can get it done in all three zones as an elite playmaker on offense, a strong puck carrier through the neutral zone and an intelligent defender who plays bigger than his 5-foot-10 frame.In his 459 career games with the Canucks, Hughes has totaled 61 goals and 371 assists. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, Hughes leads all defensemen with 285 assists, and he ranks second in points with 335. After posting 92 points in 2023-24, Hughes won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's best defenseman.\nHughes has one more season remaining on his contract at $7.85 million per season, a bargain at his current value. Next summer, Hughes will become eligible for a contract extension, and he'll get a staggering raise.Now last in the league standings, the Canucks may have gotten the sense that it would be difficult to sign Hughes to a long-term extension prior to the summer of 2027. As trade rumors became an increasingly large distraction, president of hockey operations Jim Rutheford chose to kickstart the rebuild.To that end, he was relatively successful. Rossi is an undersized but extremely skilled center who is under contract for the next two seasons at a reasonable $5 million cap hit. Rossi, the No. 9 overall pick in 2020, just posted 60 points last season.\nBuium is another former first-round pick -- the No. 12 overall selection in 2024 -- and he's managed to flash a lot of upside in just 31 career games. Buium has struggled with consistency, as all young players do, but he could develop into a top-pairing defenseman for the Canucks.If all goes according to plan for Minnesota, that 2026 first-round pick won't be very high, but it's another asset Vancouver can use to stock its prospect pool as the franchise enters a new era.The Canucks also got Ohgren, yet another first-round pick, who has yet to show much at the NHL level.\nTrade gradesMinnesota WildGuerin likely winced when finalizing this deal. Rossi and Buium could be very good players for a long time -- and first-round picks are also valuable -- but the juice is worth the squeeze on this one. Teams can search for years and not find a defenseman of Hughes' caliber, and the 26-year-old is still ascending toward his peak.To put it simply, the Canucks were a dominant team when Hughes was in the game. Since the start of the 2023-24 season, Vancouver owned a 54.1% expected goals share and a plus-40 goal differential when Hughes was on the ice at five-on-five, per Natural Stat Trick. Now consider his offensive production and an extremely heavy workload, and those numbers only look even more impressive. Hughes is a rare player, and Minnesota capitalized on a golden opportunity.As for what Hughes will look like with the Wild, I would love to see him play alongside fellow American Brock Faber. While Faber has shown the potential to become a great shutdown defenseman, he doesn't provide enough offense to be a high-end No. 1. Pair him with Hughes, however, and Minnesota could have a top-five pairing on its hands.\nIf there's any drawback at all for the Wild, it's that the loss of Rossi makes them relatively thin at center in the short-term. Maybe Danila Yurov develops into a quality replacement for Rossi, but he's not there just yet. Still, Rossi probably has a second-line ceiling. While it's not necessarily a breeze to find those players, it's much easier to acquire them than superstar defensemen. Grade: AVancouver CanucksIt seemed like the Canucks were resigned to the fact that Hughes wouldn't sign an extension with them before hitting free agency in 2027. Maybe that was the message they got from Hughes, but I'm surprised they didn't make a couple more runs at persuading him over the next 18 months. Hughes was the face of the franchise, and this deal will obviously trigger a big step back.In terms of the return, let's just be blunt. It's nearly impossible to recoup the value of any superstar in a trade. Vancouver would have been hard-pressed to find an even deal, and it didn't. That said, it could have been much worse if the Canucks simply got tired of trade rumors and dealt him to the New Jersey Devils for a lesser package.\nBuium is the big get here, in my opinion. The 20-year-old still has a lot of developing to do, but he has a ton of upside. Buium led the University of Denver to a national championship in 2024, and he posted 48 points in 41 games last season. Putting Hughes-level expectations on Buium would be unfair, but he could be a key piece of Vancouver's blue line for a long time.Rossi can be a quality second-line center, and he would be a good fit with the Canucks if Elias Pettersson manages to get back on track after an underwhelming last 92 games. Rossi flashed his playmaking ability in 2024-25 while notching 24 goals, 36 assists and 60 points. Again, Rossi may not be a future superstar, but he could be a key contributor for the next decade.Ohgren seems like more of a throw-in here because he hasn't quite hit his stride at the NHL level. He has yet to tally a point in 18 games this season. He might be a lottery ticket for Vancouver.\nThe first round pick will help the Canucks add more talent to their pipeline, which might get a major influx of talent with the team on track to get the No. 1 pick in 2026. The loss of Hughes will sting for a while, but this deal does lay the groundwork for a strong future. Grade: C+\n            ",

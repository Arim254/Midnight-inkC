    "body": "\n        Two NFC South rivals square off in Week 10 action when the New Orleans Saints visit the Carolina Panthers. It's been a rough start to Kellen Moore's tenure as New Orleans' head coach as the Saints are 1-8 and are in contention to have the No. 1 overall pick in April's NFL Draft. The team recently made a change at quarterback, benching Spencer Rattler in favor of rookie Tyler Shough. As for the Panthers, they're 5-4 and are quietly playing good football. They beat the Green Bay Packers last week and have gotten a big boost offensively behind running back Rico Dowdle, who has 652 rushing yards over his last five games.Kickoff from Bank of America Stadium is set for 1 p.m. ET, and the Panthers are 5.5-point favorites at home, according to the latest Saints vs. Panthers SportsLine consensus odds. The over/under for total points scored is 39.5. The Panthers are -254 money line favorites (risk $254 to win $100), while the Saints are +205 underdogs (wager $100 to win $205).

Florida State was held to 13 points at Stanford two games ago, and it finished with 22 points against Miami in early October.

    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim and Randy Brown took very different paths to their first UFC Fight Night main event. Bonfim is a relatively new addition to the UFC roster; meanwhile, Brown celebrates a decade with the promotion in January. They collide on Saturday night at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.Bonfim (18-1) is defending his ranking, but arguably has more to prove than his opponent. Bonfim became a top 15 welterweight off a controversial decision win over longtime contender Stephen \"Wonderboy\" Thompson. Two years ago, nearly to the day, he was knocked out by Nicolas Dalby. A close decision win over Brown, an unranked fighter approaching 10 years with the promotion, won't do him much good. Bonfim needs a standout performance.\"If I let Brown control the distance and keep the fight standing, he has an advantage, that's his game. But not with me,\" Bonfim told CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter. \" I'm very comfortable exchanging punches. I know he's afraid and weary of my ground game.\"\n        \n            \n                Jon Jones rips Tom Aspinall's skills after UFC 321: 'His wrestling and jiu-jitsu are incredibly overrated'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrown (20-6) is determined to make the most of his first main event. He's a promising contender, but every time he builds steam, his momentum gets cut short by guys like Belal Muhammad, Jack Della Maddalena and Vicente Luque. But all that experience has given him a level head. Brown is coming off a KO win over Dalby, the only person to beat Bonfim, but he isn't putting much stock in it. Brown knows exactly what Bonfim did wrong, but he can't guarantee he'll make those mistakes again. \"I know exactly what he lost that fight and what happened. I can't assume he's in that same place. He was pushed, overwhelmed, got tired, and was stopped...\" Brown told CBS Sports. \"I can't bank on him making those same mistakes. For all I know, he's in the best shape of his life, and when he shows up he'll be ready to do 10 rounds.\" \nBelow is the rest of the fight card for Saturday, with the latest odds before we get to a prediction and pick on the main event. UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavorite Underdog Weight classGabriel Bonfim -190Randy Brown +160Welterweight  Joseph Morales -420  Matt Schnell +330  FlyweightUros Medic -150  Muslim Salikhov +125  WelterweightIsmael Bonfim -195Chris Padilla +165  LightweightRicky Simon -180Raoni Barcelos +150BantamweightMarco Tulio -185  Christian Leroy Duncan +155  Middleweight UFC Fight Night viewing information Date: Nov. 8 | Start time: 7 p.m. ET (main card) Location: UFC Apex -- Las Vegas TV channel: ESPN+ Prediction Gabriel Bonfim vs. Randy Brown: Don't let Bonfim's ranking fool you; he has something to prove. Many believe \"Wonderboy\" beat Bonfim. Dalby knocked him out. They were Bonfim's two most experienced opponents. Brown is another such veteran, having faced world-class competition for over a decade. He's fully capable of exploiting whatever holes Bonfim gives him, especially should he wilt over five rounds. Skill-wise, I lean towards Bonfim. He has fantastic submissions, judicious wrestling, and responsible striking defense. Thompson outstruck Bonfim in totality, but their significant strike outputs were almost identical. \nLast year, Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos took down Brown four times. The year before that, Della Maddalena submitted Brown -- one of only two submission wins in the champ's 20-fight pro career. There are conditions we should acknowledge in those two fights: Brown still beat Dos Santos, and Della Maddalena locked in the rear-naked choke off a knockdown. The fight benefits Brown the longer it goes. Ultimately, Bonfim shines more where Brown struggles. The inverse isn't quite as true. I'll take Bonfim, hesitantly, by submission. Bonfim via SUB2\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        It has been one week since the Dodgers beat the Blue Jays in a thrilling Game 7 to capture their second straight World Series. We're still waiting for the offseason's first significant move, but now that qualifying offers have been issued, that should come soon. Here are the latest hot stove nuggets now that Munetaka Murakami has been posted for MLB teams.   Blue Jays want to re-sign Bichette \nNot surprisingly, the Blue Jays want to re-sign star shortstop Bo Bichette, GM Ross Atkins told reporters (via Sportsnet). Atkins added that Toronto has a \"good bit of versatility\" on its infield in case Bichette signs elsewhere. We ranked Bichette as the third best free agent available this offseason and project him to receive a seven-year contract worth $189 million. The Blue Jays could play Andrés Giménez at short, Addison Barger at third, and Ernie Clement at second should Bichette leave, though they would be losing a significant bat and a beloved homegrown player. Still only 27, Bichette is one of the youngest free agents on the market this offseason. He posted a 120 OPS+ for the sixth time in seven MLB seasons in 2025. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     \tPadres expected to extend Preller Padres POBO A.J. Preller is expected to sign a contract extension in the coming days, reports The Athletic. San Diego will introduce new manager Craig Stammen at a press conference Monday and Preller's extension should be finalized by then. Preller, 48, has been the club's lead baseball operations executive since August 2014. The Padres have been to the postseason four times in the last six seasons after reaching the postseason five times in the franchise's first 51 years. \n \tBraves re-sign Carrasco \nThe Braves have re-signed veteran righty Carlos Carrasco to a minor-league contract, according to Baseball America. Now 38, Carrasco made three ineffective starts for Atlanta this past season after beginning the year with the Yankees. He is far removed from his prime -- Carrasco has a 5.50 ERA since 2021 -- though the Braves continue to value him as a depth starter, and Carrasco wants to continue playing, so the two sides reunited early this offseason. \n            \n    ",

CBS Sports Golazo will be your place to see the action as league leaders Cruz Azul host Pumas UNAM and Toluca hosts Club America. While all four teams have qualified for the playoffs, the race for the elusive top spot is on the line. Already ahead by a point, all Cruz Azul needs is a victory to take the top spot, but if they fail to win, that's when things can get interesting. Toluca and Club America only trail by a point, and they have superior goal difference, so a Cruz Azul loss and a draw in that game would see Toluca win the league, while if Cruz Azul loses, the winner between Toluca and Club America will take the top spot. If Cruz Azul fail to win while America and Toluca finish in a draw, then Tigres can even rise from fourth in the league to take the top spot. It has been a closely contested battle atop the league, and that's only highlighted by the fact that any of the four teams can come out on top heading into the playoffs. Pumas will have added motivation to upset things as with a win over Cruz Azul, not only can they impact the title race, but that would also be enough to make the final spot in the playoffs. Given that 10 of the 18 teams in the league qualify for playoffs, missing out would be quite a disappointment for Pumas, but they'll have a tough road to climb.Liga MX scores and scheduleFriday, Nov. 7Juarez 1, Queretaro 2Mazaltan 1, Necaxa 1Club Tijuana 2, Atlas 0Saturday, Nov. 8\nTigres UNAL vs. San Luis, 6 p.m. (Universo)Chivas Guadalajara vs, Monterrey, 6:07 p.m. (Telemundo)Club Leon vs. Puebla, 8 p.m. (Vix)Toluca vs. Club America, 8 pm.

    "body": "\n        When the Portland Trail Blazers traded for Jrue Holiday, and the $104 million remaining on his contract that is on the books through his age-37 season, few people regarded it as anything more than a very expensive mentorship for Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe. But the Blazers saw it as something more. General manager Joe Cronin declared this year \"winning time\" and saw the Holiday acquisition as a means to that lofty end. He had done it before, after all. Holiday put Boston over the top. Ditto for Milwaukee. Now here he is, doing it again in Portland. Nobody is saying the Blazers are going to compete for, let alone win, a championship any time soon. But along with the 6-2 Bulls, they are the surprise story of the young season at 5-3 with wins over the Lakers, Warriors, Nuggets and Thunder. I had them at No. 5 in the latest Power Rankings and they have earned every inch of that recognition. Holiday isn't doing this alone. But that was the point. Portland already had good players comprising a top-five defense over the latter third of last season. Something, or someone, just had to put them over the top, relatively speaking. Holiday, thought to be on the decline after a down campaign with Boston last year, is doing that and more with his highest scoring output (17.6 PPG) since his last season with the Bucks and 7.6 assists, his best mark in over a half decade. \nIt's arguable whether Holiday has been Portland's best player so far. That honor probably belongs to Deni Avdija, who's on an All-Star track. But this is Holiday's team. The winning culture and confidence pulsating through Portland right now is no coincidence. Holiday brings that with him everywhere he goes. That and his defensive prowess, which is still elite, are like carry-on bags. But it's been his scoring aggression and overall license to initiate offense that has made what became an increasingly peripheral role in Boston feel like a forgotten time. With the Celtics, Holiday was support staff for Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. He spaced the floor. Played defense. Made plays and shots when they came his way, but even those contributions eventually became a secondary schtick to Derrick White. In Portland, Holiday is back in the pilot's seat of a plane that is flying at the league's second-fastest pace. Usage%Touches/GMDrives/GMFGA/GM3PT/GM2024-25 w/Celtics16.846.54.89.24.92025-26 w/Blazers24.377.811.6147.1Pay particular attention to that 11.6 number. That's more drives than Giannis Antetokounmpo. As a unit, the Blazers are averaging 60 drives per game, tied with Charlotte for tops in the league. Avdija's 17.8 drives per game rank fourth league-wide. Now pair that with Portland's defense, which is forcing a league-high 20.8 turnovers per game, which is then turning into 24.6 points per game (second only to OKC's 24.7), and you come to a common theme: Pressure. \"I feel like the way we play, the energy that we come with every game, it's not going to be an easy night for anyone who plays against us,\" Holiday said after Portland overcame a 22-point deficit to beat OKC. \"That's part of our identity, to make it tough on teams.\" Indeed, this is a team that attacks. And they do it together. Pressuring and swarming to the ball with packs of defenders led by Holiday and Toumani Camara, taking it from opponents, and getting out in transition -- where they spend 23.5% of their possessions (90th percentile league wide, per Synergy) while scoring 18.9 fast break points per game, the fourth-highest mark in the league. \nThe following clip is a perfect distillation of the two-way pressure Portland puts on you. Drive into a crowd, get stripped, push the other way, make a bunch of quick, decisive passes that ends in a lob dunk for Donovan Clingan (who, incidentally, is the backend protector that allows Portland to apply all this pressure on the perimeter). That kind of passing flow is not a one off for these Blazers. It's what they do. They've gone from bottom 10 in passes per game last year to top 10 this year, and they are passes that slowly increase the pressure of a possession. That's what is really setting Portland apart. It's not just that they drive a lot; it's that they pass out of those drives 27.1 times a game, the highest mark in the league. They don't rely on one-man attacks from start to finish as much as they do inclusive, chain-reaction sequences. Drive. Cut. Pass. Each action stressing the increasingly leveraged defense until it finally breaks the seas part. When it works, it looks like this. Half-court possessions, combined with all the time they spend in transition, is how Portland is taking 33.1% of its shots at the rim, second only to the Bulls' 36.5. Add in the 42.1 3-pointers a game, which ranks fifth league-wide, and over 75% of Portland's total shots are coming from either inside the restricted area or outside the 3-point line. Cleaning the Glass tracks who gets the best shots from the best spots based on location-specific league averages, and only the Bulls have a healthier shot diet than the Blazers. Sure, they could stand to make a bit more of those shots (their 52.0 effective field-goal percentage ranks 24th, per CTG), but shooting and their own turnovers on offense are the only things that resemble a flaw on this team right now, so let's not get too picky. Besides, the Blazers are so good defensively and create so many extra possessions with turnovers and offensive rebounds (Clingan is second only to Jalen Duren with 35 so far) that even with the inconsistent shooting they are currently scoring more points per game than all but six teams. Put that together with a top-eight defense, and, well, you've got yourself a pretty damn good team. A team that is a lot closer to competing for real with the big boys than the many critics of the Holiday deal ever would've guessed. So kudos to Cronin and company for taking the swing on Holiday. Again, he's probably not the best player on this team (Advija is kind of awesome, so is Jerami Grant, and if Sharpe ever gets his shooting dialed, watch out), but he is without question the most important right now. He has taken a talented group and turned it into an actual good team that has started out 5-3 against by far the toughest schedule in the league. That's no small feat, even as early season results go. Does any of this mean we should now be holding the Blazers to a playoffs-or-bust standard? Absolutely not. The Western Conference is a bloodbath. Frankly, if this Portland team does grab a top-six seed, it'll qualify as a small miracle. But make no mistake, the Blazers can play with, and beat, anyone on any night. Holiday is right. You are going to have your hands full when you step on the court with this team, and there's every reason to think they will only get stronger. Henderson is yet to play. If you look beyond this season, Damian Lillard is back in the fold, and a Lillard-Holiday backcourt is a pretty damn intriguing tandem. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fernando Mendoza is back in the driver's seat on the road to the Heisman Trophy. The Indiana quarterback delivered a game-winning drive for the ages in the Hoosiers' electric 27-24 win at Penn State and in turn climbed back into betting favorite status in the award race.Indiana's undefeated season was in extreme peril in the fourth quarter of the road trip to Beaver Stadium. A loss to a reeling Penn State team would have taken the Hoosiers out of full control of their Big Ten championship destiny. It was for moments like this why Curt Cignetti hand-picked Mendoza as his quarterback of choice in the transfer portal. And, man, did he prove worthy of every cent of NIL money it took to bring him to Bloomington.Trailing by four with 1:51 to play and no timeouts in his back pocket, Mendoza bounced back from a drive-opening sack and picked apart the Nittany Lions over the course of a clutch, 80-yard march down the field. He eventually hit Omar Cooper Jr. in the back of the end zone for his first touchdown pass of the day and one of the most eye-catching completions of the college football season.Cooper's remarkable play on the ball was a landmark moment in his star teammate's Heisman campaign.\nWhile he was far from his best for much of the day against a Penn State defense stacked with NFL talent, Mendoza elevated to prime form when the Hoosiers needed a hero. Over the first nine drives of the game, he was a modest 14-of-22 passing for 131 yards with an interception. With Indiana needing a touchdown, he went 5 of 8 for 87 yards and the game-winning strike.\nHeisman Trophy oddsOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook. PlayerTeamOddsFernando MendozaIndiana+150Julian SayinOhio State+200Ty SimpsonAlabama+470Marcel ReedTexas A&M+850Gunner StocktonGeorgia+2000Jeremiah SmithOhio State+2500\"Late in the game, I threw a pick,\" Mendoza said postgame. \"That's on me. The team still had belief. The defense had belief. The special teams had belief. [Cooper] believed. He was open, I missed him a couple times, but it all came around in the end with the glory of God and with such amazing teammates and coaches. We were able to rally and get the win here in an awesome environment against a great team.\"Mendoza has been in favorable positions in the Heisman race effectively all season. This is not his first time as the betting favorite, but it could be his last. Such a campaign-defining statement this late in the season may be all it takes to launch Mendoza in front of Alabama's Ty Simpson, Ohio State's Julian Sayin and the other contenders for good.Mendoza already had the season-long numbers necessary to contend for the Heisman. Now, he has the signature moment. The junior entered the day with a Big Ten-leading 25 touchdowns on the year, a sparkling 72.3% completion rate, one of the most efficient stat lines in the nation and a perfect record.\nHe closed the afternoon with a string of plays that will endure in Indiana football lore for years to come.\n            ",

McCarthy's return from an ankle injury. The Ravens cruised past the Dolphins, 28-6, and are now 3-5 on the season after a 1-5 start.

Jackson leads the NFL in passer rating this season, and if the past is any indication, he should have another big performance Sunday. Jackson is 24-3 against NFC teams, the best interconference mark by a starting quarterback since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger, and he has thrown 20 touchdown passes and just one interception in his last seven starts against NFC teams. Jackson's return also provided a boost for Derrick Henry, who had 119 yards rushing against the Dolphins, so the Minnesota defense will have its hands full.J.J. McCarthy looks to build on big win. McCarthy has experienced plenty of ups and downs to start his NFL career. After missing all of his rookie year due to a knee injury, he struggled for much of his NFL debut against the Bears before rallying the Vikings to an unlikely win. He then struggled again in a Week 2 loss to the Falcons and suffered a high ankle sprain. He missed Weeks 3-8 with that injury and returned in Week 9 with his best and most consistent performance. Though the 143 yards passing aren't that impressive, he made multiple big throws -- including two touchdowns -- and also ran for a score. He has multiple passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in two of his three career NFL games.Both defenses are improving. The Ravens were one of the NFL's worst defenses early in the season, but a pair of recent developments have helped. First, they've gotten healthy, with Roquan Smith, Marlon Humphrey and others returning from injury. Second, the acquisition of Alohi Gilman has allowed the Ravens to play with three safeties more often and move Kyle Hamilton closer to the line of scrimmage. The Vikings uncharacteristically struggled in consecutive losses to the Eagles and Chargers but got back on track in Week 9, by limiting the Lions' potent rushing attack to just 65 yards and sacking Jared Goff five times.Vikings vs. Ravens pick, prediction\nEven with improvements last week, the Vikings are allowing the sixth-most yards per play since Week 6, and now they're facing an offense back at full strength with Jackson in the fold. McCarthy looked more comfortable and confident in his return from injury, but the lack of explosiveness will make it hard for Minnesota to keep up with Jackson, Henry & Co. Pick: Ravens -4.5; Under 48.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

The win was engineered by veteran quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who will remain Arizona's QB1 for at least the next four games after the team recently placed Kyler Murray on injured reserve. Bet Seahawks vs. Cardinals at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boost tokens with the promo code CBS20X. Click here to get started:Arizona (3-5) is facing a red hot Seahawks team that bolstered their roster just before the NFL trade deadline when they acquired former Saints receiver/returner Rashid Shaheed. At 6-2, the Seahawks are trying to keep pace with the also 6-2 Rams in the NFC West standings. \nWhere to watch Cardinals vs. Seahawks liveWhen: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 4:05 p.m. ETWhere: Lumen Field -- Seattle, Washington TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Seahawks -6.5; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Cardinals vs. Seahawks: Need to know The Cardinals \"new\" QB1. The 32-year-old Brissett has embraced his role as a veteran quarterback that is more than capable of stepping in at a moment's notice. In three games this season, Brissett has completed an impressive 65.2% of his passes with six touchdowns and just one interception. Tom Brady's former backup in New England, Brissett has 92 games and 56 career starts under his belt. Seahawks to work in new receiver. In Shaheed, the Seahawks are getting a 27-year-old playmaker who is still very much in his prime. This year, despite shaky quarterback play in New Orleans, Shaheed still managed to catch 44 passes for 499 yards and two touchdowns. He caught 6 of 9 targets for 33 yards during the Saints' Week 1 loss to the Cardinals. Seattle's \"other\" receiver. Shaheed should help open things up for new teammate Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who currently leads the NFL with 948 receiving yards. The former Ohio State standout has been on a tear lately; he averaged 136.5 yards per game and caught eight passes in each of the Seahawks' last four games. Speaking of receivers. Arizona has its own dynamic pass-catching duo in Marvin Harrison Jr. and tight end Trey McBride. Harrison's production has steadily picked up this season; he had seven catches for 96 yards and a score against the Cowboys. McBride also had a touchdown in Dallas and is the team's leader with five touchdown receptions. Defense, anyone? We've talked a lot about offense, but both teams have pretty good defenses, too. Arizona is currently 11th in the NFL in fewest points allowed and is also 10th in third down efficiency. Seattle's defense has been even better, as it is fifth in the NFL in points allowed, third in interceptions recorded, first in average yards-per-carry allowed and ninth in red zone efficiency. Cardinals vs. Seahawks prediction, pick \nArizona was competitive in each of its first eight games, and I expect that to again be the case on Sunday. But as was the case in five of their first eight contests, I'm picking the Cardinals to come up short once again. Seattle's defense is the main reason why I'm going with the home team. Specifically, Seattle's formidable pass rush may prove to be a big factor in Sunday's game. The fact that the Seahawks also boast the league's fifth-ranked scoring offense doesn't hurt, either. Pick: Seahawks -6.5; Under 44.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        In a two-minute situation with no timeouts, Indiana relied on Heisman candidate Fernando Mendoza to deliver the most clutch drive of his collegiate career during Saturday's 27-24 victory at Penn State.The Hoosiers' hurry-up in front of 100,000-plus at Beaver Stadium culminated with Mendoza's 7-yard toss to Omar Cooper Jr. in the back of the end zone, who dazzled despite solid coverage and came down with the football with his left toe inbounds to push Indiana ahead.\"It was the most improbable victory I've been apart of and there couldn't have been a better place to make it happen,\" Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said after the game, noting Indiana's first win in program history at Penn State.The Nittany Lions had the unbeaten Hoosiers on the ropes following Nick Singleton's second touchdown of the fourth quarter to give Penn State a 24-20 lead after Indiana had once held a 13-point advantage.\n\n        \n            \n                No. 2 Indiana survives upset bid from Penn State thanks to insane Omar Cooper Jr. touchdown catch\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSacked on the first snap of the final drive, Mendoza picked himself off the turf and moved the chains with a completion to Cooper for a 22-yard gain to get the possession going for the Hoosiers.\"We refused to lose in the bleakest, most dire moments when it looked impossible,\" Cignetti said. \"Barely a minute to go and haven't gotten anything offensively in quite awhile, quarterback taking a lot of shots and to all the sudden start making plays like we made, incredible plays. \"To score at the end like that ... it's a game of inches, it truly is. This team refused to lose and I'm proud of this football team.\"\nIntercepted on a previous fourth-quarter pass attempt that gave Penn State a change-of-possession at Indiana's 44-yard line and led to a touchdown, Mendoza shook off the mistake and showed pinpoint accuracy in the final moments.\"The best thing I can say is we refused to lose,\" Cignetti said. \"We had that one last big run left in us. I guarantee you when Fernando got sacked on first down, how many people in this room counted us out? Right? Great drive.\"What's next for IndianaCignetti's now 21-2 at Indiana and pushed this season's record to 10-0 after debuting behind Ohio State in Tuesday night's first College Football Playoff rankings. With a win over Wisconsin next week, the Hoosiers lock in their first Big Ten Championship Game appearance in program history.\nIndiana reached the playoff for the first time last fall, but fell flat at Notre Dame in the first round, who eventually reached the national championship. This time around, getting to Indianapolis likely cements an opening-round bye for the Hoosiers, who would play in the Orange Bowl as the No. 3 seed behind the Buckeyes and projected SEC champion unless they're able to topple Ohio State.Indiana's strength of schedule ranks at the bottom of the teams currently inside the selection committee's top 4 and entering Saturday's win at Penn State, had the easiest slate remaining among playoff contenders based on the combined records of remaining opponents.Indiana had no Power Four opponents in its nonconference slate this season, while Ohio State played Texas, Alabama lost to Florida State and Texas A&M beat Notre Dame.\n\"Yeah, the schedule is the schedule,\" selection committee chair Mack Rhoades said earlier this week. \"We don't talk about scheduling philosophy and how any team scheduled. We just looked at hey, this is who they have on the schedule. This is the outcome of those games. Then looking at all of the metrics at our disposal.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fernando Mendoza authored his Heisman moment on Saturday afternoon, marching the Hoosiers 80 yards down the field in 1:15 for the go-ahead touchdown to Omar Cooper Jr. to give Indiana a thrilling 27-24 win on the road at Penn State. Indiana found itself in unfamiliar territory on Saturday afternoon as Penn State erased a 13-point deficit to take a 24-20 lead on the No. 2 ranked team in the country late in the fourth quarter. After burning all three of its timeouts, Indiana was able to force a Penn State punt with two minutes to play to give Mendoza and the offense one more chance to avoid their first loss of the season.  A sack on first down was an inauspicious start, but then Mendoza began to string together some key completions. A seam shot moved them into Penn State territory and then he found the game's unlikely hero Charlie Becker for his ninth catch of the day to set up a goal-to-go situation. On third-and-goal, Mendoza threw one high to Cooper Jr. in the back of the end zone, who somehow got his left toe to tap inbounds as his right foot hovered over above the paint out of the end zone for the go-ahead and eventual winning score with 36 seconds left. \nPenn State moved the ball out to midfield, but could not push it into field goal range to try to force overtime, as Ethan Grunkemeyer's Hail Mary on the final play got knocked down. Mendoza finished the game with one of his worst statistical performances of the season, completing 19-of-30 passes for 218 yards, one touchdown and one interception. However, that one touchdown came on the backs of an incredible drive that, despite a rough game otherwise, will be remembered for a long time in Indiana football lore. Becker didn't catch the game-winning touchdown, but stepped up in a big way for injured star receiver Elijah Sarratt all game, totaling 117 yards to nearly match his career receiving yards in one game.The path to that final drive was a winding, meandering road that took a number of twists and turns before ultimately landing on an Indiana win. The Hoosiers got off to a sluggish start, but took a 20-7 lead midway through the third quarter thanks in large part to a pair of turnovers forced by their defense. \nDespite that advantage, the Indiana offense had never truly hit their stride and the Nittany Lions' defense was able to keep Penn State in the ball game. Thanks to that defensive performance, Penn State was able to trim the lead to 10 going into the fourth quarter when momentum swung the Nittany Lions' way. Early in the fourth quarter, Nick Singleton finally broke loose for a 59-yard run -- aided by an accidental block from the umpire in the secondary -- that set up a Penn State touchdown to cut the deficit to three.  \nOn the ensuing Indiana possession, Mendoza tried to hit a deep corner route on second down, but under-threw his man who got undercut by Penn State safety King Mack for an interception that gave the Nittany Lions the ball back in plus territory. \nThe Nittany Lions capitalized on that quick change of possession with another solid drive that Singleton capped off with an exclamation point, taking a screen pass and making three Indiana defenders miss on his way to the end zone for the go-ahead score. Unfortunately for Penn State, for as spectacular as their defense performed all afternoon, they could not get the final stop they needed to pull off the shocking upset. With the heartbreaking loss, Penn State falls to 3-6, and in a season full of disappointments, Saturday's may have been the most gut-wrenching of them all. For Indiana, the win keeps them undefeated at 10-0 and on a collision course with Ohio State for the Big Ten Championship later this year. They will certainly have some things to clean up on tape, as the defense got gashed on the ground late and the offense was not nearly as consistent as they'd like to be. Curt Cignetti will be happy to let his team learn those lessons in a win rather than a loss and keep all of the one-loss Big Ten teams behind them in the standings. \n            ",

Carolina just sprung a huge upset against the Green Bay Packers in Lambeau Field, and New Orleans just got shelled by the Los Angeles Rams.Anyone who thought about writing off the Panthers as playoff contenders can forget it because they just pulled off one of the most surprising results of the season with their 16-13 win over the Packers. Running back Rico Dowdle, who wrestled the starting job from Chuba Hubbard, has given the offense a little more juice. He went for 141 total yards and two touchdowns against a stout Green Bay defense. After an 0-2 start, the Panthers have rattled off five wins in their last seven games.Bet Panthers vs. Saints at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS: Click here to get started:On the other sideline, the Saints have been written off for a while now, and for good reason. They have one of the worst quarterback situations in the NFL, and that showed last week. In his first career start, Tyler Shough threw for 176 yards, one touchdown and one interception against a very good Rams defense. Shough faces a less difficult test this weekend, but he is down a key weapon after the Saints dealt receiver Rashid Shaheed to the Seattle Seahawks at the trade deadline.\nWhere to watch Saints vs. Panthers liveDate: Sunday, Nov. 9 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North CarolinaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Panthers -5.5; O/U 39.5 (via DraftKings)Saints vs. Panthers: Need to knowPanthers favored for this first time this season. The Panthers are the favorite in this matchup, and that marks the first time that has happened all season. In fact, Carolina hasn't been favored in this matchup since 2017 with New Orleans snapping a streak of 15 straight meetings as the favorite. It will be interesting to see how the Panthers handle a game that most everyone expects them to win.Saints' struggles against winning teams. The good news for Carolina is that New Orleans has been miserable against teams with winning records dating back to 2021. Since the start of that season, the Saints are 6-23 in 29 games against teams that are above .500. That includes an active nine-game losing streak.Rico running wild. Since Hubbard missed time with a calf injury earlier this season, Dowdle has seized the role and put up some monster numbers. In his three games as Carolina's starting running back, Dowdle has averaged 173 yards per game and 6.7 yards per attempt while finding the end zone three times. Dowdle's three games with 130 or more rushing yards are tied for the second-most in franchise history.Saints vs. Panthers prediction, pick\nThe Panthers haven't been a favorite all season, so there's no track record there. That makes me a little nervous, but how can I possibly bank on the Saints in this spot? Shough will be making his second career start, and the offense will be worse with the loss of Shaheed. Add in the fact that Dowdle should shred the New Orleans defense, and I could see the Panthers winning this one by a touchdown.

    "body": "\n        The Dallas Cowboys took a calculated risk by trading a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick to the Pittsburgh Steelers for wide receiver George Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick in May. Pickens had worn out his welcome in Pittsburgh because of his attitude and immaturity despite his immense talent. The Steelers trading the equivalent of a second-round pick to the Seattle Seahawks for wide receiver DK Metcalf in March and giving him a a four-year contract extension, averaging nearly $33 million per year in the process, spoke volumes about Pittsburgh's frustrations with Pickens.The 2022 second-round pick is exceeding expectations in Dallas. Pickens is performing at an All-Pro level in his contract year, which pays him $3.656 million for 2025. His 908 yards receiving are not only second in the NFL but the most any Cowboys player has ever had in his first 10 games with the team. Pickens' seven receiving touchdowns, a career high, are tied for third in the league while ranking seventh with 15.7 yards per catch. His 58 receptions fall just outside of the top 10 at 11th in the NFL. Pickens is on pace for 99 receptions, 1,544 yards receiving and 12 touchdowns.Pickens demonstrated that he can be a true No. 1 wide receiver while CeeDee Lamb, his Cowboys receiving counterpart, missed the better part of four games with a high left ankle sprain. Lamb and Pickens arguably have become the NFL's best receiving tandem.Equally important, Pickens has been on his best behavior this season outside of being benched along with Lamb for the opening offensive series in a disciplinary action during Monday night's game against the Las Vegas Raiders. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called Pickens an exemplary teammate earlier this season.\nDuring Jones' weekly Tuesday radio interview on 105.3 The Fan, he didn't have any qualms about having two high-priced wide receivers on a go forward basis in addition to the significant financial commitment he is making on the interior of the defensive line. Jones replied \"yes\" when asked whether Lamb and Pickens are the best receiving duo the Cowboys have ever had.Lamb is the NFL's third-highest-paid wide receiver with the four-year, $136 million extension, averaging $34 million per year, he signed in August 2024. The deal has $100 million in guarantees, of which $67 million was fully guaranteed at signing. At the time, both marks were the second most ever in a wide receiver contract. The $67 million fully guaranteed at signing included a wide receiver-record $38 million signing bonus.Pickens said he wouldn't mind staying in Dallas about a month ago. He put winning as his top priority. The Cowboys are fighting an uphill battle to make the playoffs with a 4-5-1 record. A strong finish to the season would help in this regard.\nCowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer is already publicly lobbying for Pickens to remain in Dallas. He said on Tuesday, \"I'm very in favor of George having a long-term future with us.\"Absent a new deal before early March, Pickens will be designated as a franchise player given Jones' thoughts about roster construction. The deadline for teams to use a franchise or transition tag is March 3 at 4 p.m. ET.The 2026 non-exclusive franchise tag for wide receivers projects to 9.016% of the 2026 salary cap. It's 8.581% in 2025. If the 2026 salary cap is set at $300 million, a 7.45% increase over 2025's $279.2 million salary cap, the wide receiver figure should be $27.047 million.\nSome salary cap gymnastics will need to be performed to accommodate a Pickens franchise tag. Dallas has the NFL's most 2026 salary cap commitments at $362.832 million with 44 players under contract, according to NFLPA data, after acquiring Pro Bowl defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, who is making $21.75 million in 2026, at the Nov. 4 trade deadline. The top 51 salaries (i.e.; salary cap numbers) matter under offseason accounting rules. There is $21.54 million of existing cap space that can be carried over to 2026.\n        \n            \n                Did Monday's dominant win show the Cowboys can make a playoff run? Now comes the real test\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Cowboys routinely push current cap obligations into the future by restructuring contracts. Quarterback Dak Prescott has the NFL's fourth highest 2026 salary cap number at $74,068,430. Lamb's $38.6 million 2026 cap hit is second among wide receivers. Offensive guard Tyler Smith has the league's fifth highest 2026 cap number for an offensive lineman. It's $27,502,300. The Cowboys can create approximately $67.5 million of cap space by restructuring their contracts. That would be a good start to addressing the 2026 salary cap overage.The Cowboys essentially have two No. 1 wide receivers and will likely have to pay accordingly to keep Pickens long term. The range for a Pickens deal is probably between Tee Higgins' $28.75 million per year, which sets the bar for No. 2 wide receivers, and Lamb's $34 million per year. Higgins signed a four year, $115 million contract from the Cincinnati Bengals in March after being designated as a franchise player for a second straight year. The deal is worth up to $121.8 million through incentives. Higgins is currently the NFL's 11th-highest-paid wide receiver.\nDallas will be reluctant to put Pickens above Lamb in the wide receiver salary hierarchy. Lamb was coming off the greatest receiving season in Cowboys history when he signed his deal. He had 135 catches for 1,749 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2023 while earning first-team All-Pro honors. His 135 receptions not only led the league but were the sixth most ever in an NFL season. Lamb was second and third in the NFL, respectively, in receiving yards and touchdown catches.Pickens and Lamb have played six complete games together this season. Lamb has 40 receptions for 557 yards and two touchdowns while being targeted 61 times. Pickens has caught 34 passes for 481 yards with two touchdowns. He has been targeted 48 times in those six games.It wouldn't be surprising for Athletes First's Trevon Smith, who is Pickens' agent of record, according to the NFLPA, to seek top five wide receiver money for his client. Garrett Wilson is the league's fifth-highest-paid wide receiver at $32.5 million per year. The Jets signed Wilson, who is 25, to a four-year, $130 million extension with $90 million of guarantees where $38,324,819 was fully guaranteed at signing in July. He got the deal after career highs of 101 receptions, 1,104 yards receiving and seven touchdowns in 2024. \nWilson was in the same draft class as Pickens. He was 2022's 10th overall pick. Wilson is a few months older. Pickens turns 25 next March one day after the franchise tag deadline.The Metcalf deal, at nearly $33 million per year, could be an important data point for Pickens since that's what his former team was willing to pay another wide receiver instead of him. There are $80 million in guarantees, of which $60 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The last $20 million of the guarantees in 2027 are for injury only. Metcalf's contract is slightly backloaded. The first three new years average just under $32.175 million per year since there is $35.5 million in 2029, the last year of Metcalf's deal.The NFL's 10 highest-paid wide receivers are signed to contracts with just over $1.212 billion of new money collectively for 37 new contract years to average approximately $32.75 million per year. This is in line with Wilson and Metcalf's deals. These 10 wide receiver contracts average slightly more than $83 million in guarantees and approximately $55.725 million fully guaranteed at signing.\nThere is an interesting dynamic looming over any Pickens negotiations. Smith works closely with David Mulugheta at Athletes First. Jones' penchant for trying to circumvent the agent process by dealing directly with players was a catalyst for the bitter contract dispute that led to All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, a Mulugheta client, being traded to the Green Bay Packers shortly before the start of the regular season. Jones has downplayed the notion that there will be any residual effects from the Parsons ordeal that will negatively impact the ability to get a deal done with Pickens' camp. Athletes First also represents Smith. The Cowboys didn't have any problem signing Smith to a four-year, $96 million extension, which made him the league's highest-paid offensive guard at $24 million per year, about two weeks after Parsons was dealt.The Bengals have the most money devoted to a wide receiver duo with a combined $69 million per year for Ja'Marr Chase and Higgins. Chase is the NFL's highest-paid wide receiver. He received a four-year, $161 million extension, averaging $40.25 million per year, at the same time Higgins signed. Chase's deal has $109.8 million of guarantees where $73.9 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The Cowboys won't be too far behind the Bengals in combined average yearly salary for a wide receiver tandem if a long-term agreement can be reached with Pickens in the next few months.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        J.J. McCarthy has been the worst starting quarterback in the NFL this season, by almost every metric you want to look at. Of every QB who has played in at least five games, only Russell Wilson has thrown for less passing yards than McCarthy. He's also thrown eight interceptions, has the worst EPA per play among every qualifying QB even when you adjust for drops, and only Dillon Gabriel has a lower Success Rate as a QB. On top of that, the Minnesota Vikings, who came into this season with high hopes of building on a magical 2024, are on the brink of starting their 2026 NFL Draft scouting. Justin Jefferson is throwing helmets on the sidelines and head coach Kevin O'Connell is talking about letting cement dry when asked about developing McCarthy's fundamentals:\nMind you, we're in week 12. Not exactly the things you want to hear.McCarthy and the Vikings are free falling, with many fans wondering why the QB hasn't panned out yet despite being with one of the most affluent QB whisperers in the NFL and the best wide receiver in the league. The QB they traded up for in the 2024 Draft has looked like the worst first round QB of the bunch. So I went and dug through some numbers and tape from Sunday's loss to the Chicago Bears, to find out what's wrong and what the Vikings can do to fix their young QB.By now, you've probably seen this throw by McCarthy:\nAnd this throw:\nAnd this throw:\nThe first thing that stands out about McCarthy's poor play this season is quite simple: he's been one of the most inaccurate QBs in the NFL. Of all first round QBs drafted since 2015, McCarthy has the third-highest Off-Target rate, only behind Trey Lance and Anthony Richardson. \n\n        \n            \n                Week 12 NFL QB Power Rankings: Broncos' Bo Nix nears top 10; Browns' Shedeur Sanders debuts\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNow most times, when a QB is inaccurate you look at mechanics, and that's where we start with McCarthy. When he drops back to pass, especially throwing to his left, you can tell that he overstrides and opens up his shoulder far too quickly, causing a lot of passes to sail. On the first incompletion shown at the top of the story, McCarthy is putting his entire body into throwing this speed out, and opens up far too much to throw this ball. Tom Brady actually made a YouTube video on throwing a football, and he spoke about how he used to rotate around his left arm, causing himself to open up far too much and the accuracy would spray. When watching McCarthy throw to his left, it almost looks like he's trying to throw this ball through a wind turbine, and notice he rotates all the way around to throw this ball and it ends up sailing inaccurately out of bounds.On this deep incompletion to Jordan Addison, it looks like McCarthy is trying to throw his whole body into this pass, which is what causes him to lose accuracy in hopes for just raw power. It's like he's recoiling after every pass, which is never what you want to see from an NFL QB. From the end zone angle, you'll notice the left shoulder overrotate, and his back leg comes up off the ground, causing this ball to go in the direction of his rotational force: too far to the left and short about five yards.\nThe footwork also gets really murky in these situations, and when O'Connell talks about getting the cement to dry with McCarthy's fundamentals, I think that's what he's talking about. Throwing a football is a rotational action, with power being generated up off the ground, through the hips and into the shoulder. When your base is compromised, it throws off your accuracy. Often, McCarthy will either stride too much or click his heels together throughout his process of throwing the ball, wasting movement and making himself less efficient throwing the football. It's almost like his brain knows where he wants to go with the ball, but his body is trying to do far too much and he ends up sinking the play overall. This is during the two minute drill, where the Vikings run a screen and go with TE T.J. Hockenson getting wide open. McCarthy knows where to go with the ball, but he rushes his process and dirts this pass. Look at his feet in the pocket; never quiet, lots of wasted motion. Like a puppy with the zoomies.\nThe worst part of this all: these were all issues coming out of Michigan for McCarthy. The footwork problems, the over-rotation in the upper body, sailing passes throwing to his left, all problems that were listed on various scouting reports in the 2024 NFL Draft. The fact that none of it has improved yet is the most alarming thing. Yes, I know he had the knee injury that basically ended any year of live reps he could've gotten, but not showing some improvement on those mechanical issues is a big problem. McCarthy isn't athletic enough to overcome some of the issues that his mechanics cause him in a way that QBs like Josh Allen were able to during the early portion of his career. McCarthy's rushing through and sometimes just negligence of his foundation saps his arm and hurts him in the long run, which is where everything starts as a QB. His eyes are in the right place; it's everything else that's the big problem.So how do the Vikings mitigate these issues to try and get the most out of what is becoming a lost season? In the short term, I think running more tempo in the offense could help clean up his footwork. Giving him less to think about so he can focus on his feet being quiet and cleaning up his mechanics has paid dividends for the Vikings so far this season, and it could help McCarthy slow down, by speeding up. These are all of his passes during the final drive against the Bears, but I want to focus on the pass at the :45 second mark, a completion to Justin Jefferson. Look at how little wasted movement there is, and how the overrotation is ironed out. Pass is on time and completed, one of the better throws he made on Sunday.\nIn the long term, I think what J.J. McCarthy needs to chill out. Every throw he's missed this season has looked the same: he's so amped up and tight as a passer that he's throwing his entire body into passes that don't need to set records on the radar gun. His mechanics are bad because he's rushing through them, as if the game is moving too fast for him. Which is fascinating because he looks like he knows where to go with the ball, it's just his mechanics and body slowing him down. He's trying to play catch up, having been the only 2024 QB to miss his rookie season for a team that won 14 games last season without him. For McCarthy to truly succeed in Minnesota, he has to take advice from a former Packer QB, Aaron Rodgers: R-E-L-A-X.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New Orleans Saints have agreed to release veteran wide receiver Brandin Cooks, according to multiple reports. With New Orleans firmly in rebuilding mode and the 32-year-old Cooks potentially looking for a more impactful role on a more competitive team, this move serves as an easy break for both parties.It's also nothing new for Cooks, who has been on five different teams throughout his 12-year career -- though this is the first time he's been released. This season, Cooks had 19 receptions for 165 yards in 10 games (three starts) for the Saints, who will get a better look at younger receivers such as Devaughn Vele, Mason Tipton alongside standout Chris Olave down the stretch. New Orleans is 2-8, starting rookie second-round pick Tyler Shough at quarterback and in the clear early stages of a teardown and rebuild on both sides of the roster. New Orleans traded away Rashid Shaheed and Trevor Penning at the trade deadline.Cooks could be an intriguing candidate for teams in the playoff mix. Though his production is down this year and has been down for several seasons, he could still mix in as a speedy and reliable (one drop over the past three years) depth option with plenty of postseason experience for a receiver-needy team. These five teams could fit the bill.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo BillsThe easiest connection to make here is Buffalo. The Bills enter their Week 12 \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup without wide receivers Curtis Samuel and Mecole Hardman and tight end Dalton Kincaid. Buffalo also recently made Keon Coleman inactive for being late to meetings ahead of its Week 11 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Coleman, Josh Palmer, Khalil Shakir, Tyrell Shavers and Elijah Moore are in line to be Josh Allen's only available receivers in Week 12.\nBuffalo has been willing to take chances on later-career wideouts midseason, including Amari Cooper last year and Hardman this year. Perhaps, given the injuries, inconsistencies and other issues at the position, the Bills would consider bringing Cooks into the mix.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tampa Bay BuccaneersTampa Bay has similarly been hit hard by receiver injuries. Mike Evans (collarbone) is out until at least the final weeks of the season, Chris Godwin (fibula) hasn't played since Week 5, and Jalen McMillan (neck) hasn't played since a scary fall in the preseason. The Buccaneers have relied on rookies Emeka Egbuka and Tez Johnson and veteran Sterling Shepard for most of the last few months.Cooks could fit the Shepard mode in terms of an undersized veteran, but he could also add some downfield presence as well. Tampa Bay has lost three of four and suddenly finds itself just a half-game up on the Carolina Panthers in the NFC South. It could be worth kicking the tires.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersIt's been a bit of a stop-and-start year for Aaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh offense, which ranks 28th in yards per game and 22nd in passing yards per game. The team's receptions leader is DK Metcalf at just 37 catches this season. The next four players in that category -- Kenneth Gainwell, Jonnu Smith, Jaylen Warren and Pat Freiermuth -- are running backs or tight ends. Calvin Austin's 22 receptions are the second-most of any wide receiver. For reference, 22 receptions is tied for 122nd in the NFL this season.The Steelers have needed a secondary receiver all year. Austin and Roman Wilson, the younger options, haven't filled that void. Perhaps a veteran like Cooks -- the type of player Mike Tomlin tends to give the benefit of the doubt -- could be of use.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles RamsReunion time! Cooks played for Sean McVay's Rams in 2018 and 2019, and more than half a decade later, he could prove a helpful addition for another ring-chasing McVay team. Los Angeles has two tremendous receivers in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, but the returns have been disappointing further down the depth chart. Tutu Atwell is on IR and Jordan Whittington has 13 catches in 10 games. The Rams lean heavily into formations with three tight ends, but McVay could want more formational flexibility and more reliability from his depth receivers. Cooks could provide that.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New England PatriotsCould a different reunion be in the works? Cooks played for the Patriots in 2017, and Mike Vrabel is plenty familiar with Cooks' time with the Houston Texans, when Vrabel was coaching the AFC South-rival Tennessee Titans. New England's offense is soaring thanks to Drake Maye making a huge leap and a vastly upgraded supporting cast led by Stefon Diggs. Mack Hollins provides size and physicality, Kayshon Boutte is a speedy downfield threat, and DeMario Douglas is a crafty slot option.But Boutte has battled a hamstring injury recently, and rookie Kyle Williams hasn't quite made the early impact the Patriots may have hoped for with just three receptions. The Patriots have arrived earlier than expected, and perhaps a veteran option in the room could help down the stretch and into the postseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In a year of ups and downs, it has been hard to know what exactly to expect from the U.S. men's national team at times but at long last, things finally appear to be settling in for the World Cup co-hosts. They capped off 2025 with their first statement win under head coach Mauricio Pochettino, a 5-1 drubbing of Uruguay, extending their winning streak to three matches and closing out the year on a five-match unbeaten run.The most obvious turning point is Pochettino's switch to a back three, though it is not a \"full on, stick with it three with the back,\" per defender Tim Ream. The USMNT are undefeated since Pochettino introduced the approach in the second half of a 2-0 defeat to South Korea, acting as the foundation of the team's newfound identity. With each passing game, though, the USMNT seem to add a new complementary layer to their look, rooted in an intensity that allowed the U.S. to capitalize on just about every mistake Uruguay made on Tuesday. The fact that the USMNT continued their upward trajectory without a handful of high-profile players, though, is perhaps the strongest indicator yet that the group's hard work is finally beginning to pay off.Underneath the tactical switch is a year's worth of work Pochettino and his staff have put in to rebuild the national team, which is virtually unrecognizable from the last time the USMNT faced Uruguay, a lifeless 1-0 defeat that marked the conclusion of ex-head coach Gregg Berhalter's time in charge. A host of fresh faces are starting to become national team regulars, creating an uber-competitive race for World Cup roster spots, while the high-tempo style of play is a new constant regardless of who is on the pitch.As the long wait begins for March's international break, the final one before the World Cup, the USMNT finally seem to be peaking at just the right time.\nA fully bought-in national teamPochettino has taken a surprisingly aggressive approach to expanding the player pool, calling in around 70 players over the course of his year and change in charge. It is an approach that is beginning to pay off in a big way, Tuesday's win over Uruguay acting as the greatest source of validation the head coach could ask for. The victory highlighted one thing in particular – the group is fully bought in, the player pool's size making the feat all the more impressive. Pochettino's coaching style has made it easy for a handful of players to rise up the ranks, including Alex Freeman, who scored a brace against Uruguay.\"I feel like he's very passionate and I feel like as a coach, if you have trust in your coach and he has trust back in you, I feel like it just builds a good bond and you're able to go 100% and you're able to be the best,\" Freeman said on Tuesday. \"To have that confidence from a coach, I think that's the most confidence you can have as a player, to know that a coach can trust you, that a coach is always going to be there, even if you mess up. Also to have the coach that's intense, not afraid to tell you what's true or what's not so I feel like having a coach like that, it's going to get you bought in. It's going to get you bought into the system. It's going to make you want to do your best, so I feel like that just means a lot to the players to have a coach like that.\"Freeman felt Pochettino's trust in him from his very first day with the national team.\n\"Right when I met him, you could just tell,\" he said. \"He brought me aside the first day when I was in Gold Cup and just told me right away what I need to improve on, what I did good so I think having that trust and having that person who was going to tell you – it's not going to be black and white. He's going to tell you straight up so it's very good to have a coach like that. It just tells you that whatever happens, he's just going to tell you straight up if you pay bad or good but also he's going to tell you that you have quality. You can be very good so I think that means a lot.\"Pochettino's tactical approach – and specifically his strong desire to create a flexible game plan – creates an ideal environment for players, stylistically speaking.\"The freedom to go out there and solve problems, the freedom to impose our creativity, to make things happen, depending on the context of the match,\" defender Mark McKenzie said, \"but I think that freedom also comes with the responsibility to do the dirty work really, really well, to make sure defensively we're really strong, moving cohesively as a unit, sliding, shifting and preventing opportunities for the opponent and then once we get to the final third and the attacking half, then it's about finding those opportunities, especially get our creative players on the ball and to hurt teams.\"\nFlexibility in tactics and personnelRecruiting players with wide-ranging skillsets is a tried-and-true roster-building approach for the World Cup and is something that Pochettino has leaned on recently, especially as the live auditions for next summer's tournament continue. Diego Luna, for example, was listed on November's roster as a forward for some of his natural attacking habits, while Joe Scally's versatility earned him a starting spot in Saturday's 2-1 win over Paraguay. On Tuesday, Freeman slotted in more centrally on Tuesday while John Tolkin took up a position as a left wingback. It only bolstered Freeman's case for a World Cup spot.\"For me, it's not our credit,\" Pochettino said. \"We [only] create the platform for him to show the quality but the credit is [for] him but I'm so happy, so happy that he scored twice. I think you need to analyze in the way that he plays – he can play like a third center back, he can play forward on the side, go inside. In the time that he took the ball, how difficult it is for the opponent to stop him, go inside and play. When he has the ball, the team is like – it's like a relief. It's how easy [he] plays.\"A newfound professionalismWith each passing day, new layers of seriousness take shape in the USMNT's environment, the looming deadline of their World Cup opener quickly approaching. The tone shift may seem natural and to some degree, it is, but Pochettino suggested that a lot of behind-the-scenes work went into creating an ideal working environment.\n\"The way that we are working – the staff, the players, the naturality of the trainings, the way that we live inside the dynamic of the group, it's all very natural,\" Pochettino said. \"If you describe a group of professionals, when you say 'professional,' that is the [what the] last week or 10 days [were like]. … Not one thing happened – small thing, silly or stupid. The focus, the concentration to perform and to train and to do everything that we propose and the way of the feedback of the players, the staff, I think was amazing. I am really, really happy because the reality is much better [than] what you think, much, much better – and before was much, much, much different. [It] was completely different.\"Focus has been a theme of the week for the USMNT, Pochettino issuing a constant demand to maintain concentration for 90 minutes. That even applied after the U.S. went up 4-0 against Uruguay, the head coach upset with the goal they conceded shortly before halftime.\"I told in the halftime [break] to the players – number one, I was so disappointed in the way that we conceded and I said that we can put [the game] in danger only [if] we drop, a little bit, our focus, our concentration,\" he said. \"I said, if you accept my challenge, we need to win the second half and I told [them] we won 1-0, the second half, and I think that is in the way that we need to be.\"\nPochettino continues to try to instill an intentionality no matter the task, including a set-piece strategy that allowed them to score four times off those opportunities on Tuesday.\"I feel like we do work on it,\" Freeman said. \"It's a chance to score so I think for us, it's just to be able to know that it's an opportunity to score and we need to be 100% at it. We can't take a set piece half-assed or be halfhearted. We want to be 100% at it. … For us, it's very good to be able to score that way.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fresh off of making his NFL regular season debut, Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders will make his first career start when Cleveland faces the Raiders on Sunday in Las Vegas, coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed on Wednesday. Sanders will take all first-team reps this week, Stefanski said.Sanders is starting in relief of fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel, who is currently in the league's concussion protocol after he sustained a head injury during the Browns' Week 11 loss to the Ravens. \"I know our fans have a lot of expectations and hope, and I would be doing a disservice to myself and a disservice to the organization if I didn't feel like I am the guy,\" Sanders said on Wednesday. \"I'm doing everything I need to do; trying to be the best version of myself. With the circumstances, everything got sped up, and that's great. I like pressure in life.\"I'm just excited for everything. I feel like I'm the guy. I know I'm the guy, but you know, the game's got to speak.\" \nSanders, who played the entire second half last Sunday, largely struggled against a Baltimore defense that is currently ranked 24th in the NFL in passing yards allowed. He went 4 of 12 passing for 47 yards and an interception while not directing a single scoring drive. \nSanders and the Browns' offense did make things interesting during the game's final three minutes. On Cleveland's final drive, Sanders completed a 25-yard pass to tight end Harold Fannin Jr., a 10-yard pass to wideout Jerry Jeudy and took off on a five-yard run that put the Browns in scoring position. The game ended, however, with Sanders throwing three straight incompletions as Cleveland fell to 2-8 on the year after relinquishing a 16-10 halftime lead. \n\"Really the positives from that game was just being able to go in there,\" Sanders said. \"I don't think a lot of people understand how challenging that is for a rookie going into a game. ... As the game went on, I settled in.\" Sanders is confident that the the increased reps this week will pay dividends this weekend in Las Vegas. \"I'm more of a feel type of person,\" he said. \"That's how I learn. That's how I do everything. ... I gotta be out there. I gotta move around ... to feel my best and play my best, and I'm doing everything my power, and the team's doing everything to help me get prepared.\" \nSanders -- who referred to himself as his biggest critic -- gave an honest assessment of how he played against the Ravens. \"I think I handled the blitz pretty good,\" he said. \"I think there were some certain scenarios where I could have been tighter, my footwork and other things. But all that's about feel, and getting the reps and doing everything like that. But as time went on, you saw the comfort, the juice behind it. So I know I can get to that place.\" While it was a humbling start, Sanders' NFL debut created a buzz from fans who have been anticipating his first regular season action. Sanders, after all, was one of college football's most popular and polarizing players during his time at Colorado where he played for his father, Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. \nSpeaking of Deion, Shedeur said he isn't sure if his father will be in attendance for Sunday's game (Colorado hosts Arizona State on Saturday night). His focus has solely been on preparing for his first NFL regular season start. \"I have the opportunity to go out there and do the best I can,\" Sanders said. \"It's gonna be fun going out there, doing what I've got to do, and the fact that we are up against time. ... People want to see how quickly it is gonna take for us to have success. And I truly believe it won't be long.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\nSan Diego Padres Hall of Famer and 1976 National League Cy Young winner Randy Jones died on Tuesday, the team announced. He was 75.\"With  deep sorrow and heavy hearts, the Padres mourn the passing of our  beloved left-hander, Randy Jones,\" the Padres said in a statement. \"Randy was a  cornerstone of our franchise for over five decades, highlighted by  becoming the first Padres pitcher to win the Cy Young Award. Inducted  into the Padres Hall of Fame in 1999, his impact and popularity only  grew in his post-playing career, becoming a tremendous ambassador for  the team and a true fan favorite. Crossing paths with RJ and talking  baseball or life was a joy for everyone fortunate enough to spend time  with him. Randy was committed to San Diego, the Padres, and his family.  He was a giant in our lives and our franchise history.\"We  extend our heartfelt sympathy to his wife Marie and the entire Jones  family during this difficult time. RJ will be greatly missed.\"Jones, a Southern California native, was selected by the Padres in the fifth round of the 1972 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut the next year and was immediately impactful, throwing 139 ⅔ innings with a 3.16 ERA as a rookie. Jones stepped into San Diego's rotation in June 1973 and was a mainstay through the 1980 season, after which he was traded to the New York Mets.In 1976, Jones was a 22-game winner who led baseball in starts (40), complete games (25), and innings (315 ⅓). He had a 2.74 ERA and at one point tied Christy Mathewson's National League record by going 68 innings between walks. That earned him the first Cy Young in Padres history. Jones was arguably even better one season prior, when he threw 285 innings with a league-leading 2.24 ERA. He finished second to Hall of Famer Tom Seaver in the Cy Young voting that year.A nerve issue in his elbow required surgery in 1977 and sapped Jones' effectiveness. All told, he went 92-105 despite a 3.30 ERA with the Padres from 1973-80, and he remains the franchise's all-time leader in innings (1,766), starts (253), complete games (71), and shutouts (18). His 92 wins are second most behind Eric Show's 100.Jones finished his career with two seasons with the Mets and a spring training audition with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1983. He retired with a 100-123 record, a 3.42 ERA, two All-Star Game selections (1975-76), and the Cy Young. Jones recorded the save in the 1975 All-Star Game and then started and won the 1976 All-Star Game.Following his playing career, Jones mentored young pitchers, most notably Barry Zito. He had a restaurant and a car wash franchise in San Diego, and was active in charities that helped developmentally disabled children.Jones was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2016.\n            ",

Within the last few days we've seen the winter's first significant free-agent signing (Josh Naylor back to the Mariners) and trade (Grayson Rodriguez for Taylor Ward), and there's plenty more on the way. Here now are Wednesday's hot stove rumors.  \tYankees the favorite for Bellinger? \nIt is no secret the Yankees want to retain Cody Bellinger, and they are currently seen as the clear favorites to land him, according to MLB.com. At least week's GM Meetings, GM Brian Cashman said the Yankees would continue to pursue Bellinger even if Trent Grisham accepted the $22.025 million qualifying offer, which he did at Tuesday's deadline. \"We're comfortable. This is a very thin outfield market. If he turns it down, that means the market is flush with teams that have the need,\" Cashman said about Grisham and the qualifying offer at the GM Meetings (via SNY). \"He had a hell of a year for us, was one of the big reasons we had the level of success we did, and we'd be happy if he accepted and came back.\" The Yankees have a full outfield with Grisham flanked by American League MVP Aaron Judge and erstwhile top prospect Jasson Domínguez, though they rotated Bellinger, Domínguez, and Grisham most of 2025, plus DH will be available at times. Re-signing Bellinger could also make Domínguez a trade candidate. We ranked Bellinger as the sixth-best free agent available this offseason.  \nPeralta trade not a given for Brewers\nThe NL Central champion Brewers do not see Brandon Woodruff accepting the qualifying offer as a prelude to a Freddy Peralta trade, owner Mark Attanasio told The Athletic. \"Independent decisions (president of baseball operations Matt Arnold) and his group will make. We're certainly excited about our rotation now,\" Attanasio said.Woodruff's $22.025 million salary in 2026 will be the highest for a pitcher in team history. \nPeralta, 29, is a year away from free agency and that is usually when Milwaukee trades its best players (Corbin Burnes, Devin Williams, etc.), though not always. The Brewers kept Willy Adames through the end of his team control years and then took the draft pick when he left as a free agent. We ranked Peralta as one of the offseason's top trade candidates. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 12 commences with the Buffalo Bills visiting the Houston Texans on 'Thursday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud (concussion) has been ruled out. With Stroud out, those involved in NFL DFS contests will gravitate towards making a Josh Allen and James Cook NFL DFS stack with the Bills being top-heavy, while under-the-radar options include Khalil Shakir and Ty Johnson. As for Houston, its top daily Fantasy football pick is Nico Collins, who has thrived no matter who has thrown him passes, but the Texans' running back pairing shouldn't be overlooked.Veteran Nick Chubb may not be what he once was, but he can still move the chains and is a nice complement to Woody Marks. The rookie back is a good bet for double-digit touches every week, and he also won't set back your NFL DFS salary cap too much, thus allowing you to still include higher-priced players in TNF DFS lineups. Before making any NFL DFS picks for Bills vs. Texans on 'Thursday Night Football,' be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

The reigning MVP nearly single-handedly won many NFL DFS contests for whomever rostered him last week with 317 yards and three touchdowns through the air, plus 40 yards and three scores on the ground. Allen has multiple total touchdowns in all but one game this season and leads all quarterbacks in Fantasy points for the fourth time in his career. While Houston has an elite defense, it is susceptible on the ground to quarterbacks as each of the last three it faced had at least 33 rushing yards, despite each being less mobile than Allen. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Texans tight end Dalton Schultz. He's come on strong as of late with Davis Mills under center. Schultz has at least six catches and 51 yards in each of the last three weeks, with one total touchdown. He's averaging 60.5 receiving yards over his last six games and is on pace to have career highs in both catches and yards this season. Buffalo hasn't faced many top-tier TEs this season, but Travis Kelce -- who has fewer targets and catches than Schultz in 2025 -- had 66 yards and 2-point score versus the Bills in Week 9. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Texans vs. BillsMcClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football.'

Davis Mills will stay under center in place of C.J. Stroud (concussion) for Houston, while reigning MVP, Josh Allen, is coming off a three-passing TD, three-rushing TD masterpiece. NFL expert R.J. White is on a 113-89 roll (+2078) on his last 204 NFL picks and is backing Houston (+4.5) at home.\"Davis Mills has been effective filling in for Stroud the last two games (both wins), and he could have success at home against a Bills defense that has allowed 399 rush yards the past two games, taking the pressure off the opposing QB. The Bills' passing attack came alive last week but now they face the best pass defense in the league, and I expect Buffalo won't be able to run up the score in this matchup. The lookahead line was Bills -2.5 with the expectation Stroud would play, but it should be 3 with Mills.\" Get more 'Thursday Night Football' picks at SportsLine.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Will Stein's realization of his football mortality arrived quickly as a player. A non-typical 5-foot-10, 185-pound quarterback who was described in his Louisville bio as \"heady\" and a \"student of the game,\" Stein ascended to starter ahead of the Cardinals' 2011 campaign. He played well through two games but suffered a shoulder against Kentucky. He went to the sideline and out came a true freshman. It took a throw or two for Stein to know Teddy Bridgewater wasn't going to give the job back. \"I knew right when he went in the game,\" Stein says with a laugh. \"There's a reason he's a first-round pick.\" Stein once told Lake Travis (Texas) High School head coach Hank Carter, who he worked under as offensive coordinator for two seasons, \"Not only is (Teddy) a better guy than me, but he's a way better player. I'm just totally screwed.\" \nThat self-deprecating humor and generally positive outlook is why UTSA head coach Jeff Traylor bestowed a Remember the Titans-coded nickname on Stein. \"He's one of the brightest stars in college athletics,\" Traylor said. \"There's a reason he's called Will 'Sunshine' Stein.\" Stein may not be a first-round pick like Bridgewater. But he sure produces them as Oregon's offensive coordinator. \nAhead of a key matchup with No. 15 USC, the seventh-ranked Ducks rank third nationally in yards per play. Stein's quarterback, Dante Moore, is projected by scouts -- if he chose to leave -- to be Oregon's third straight Day 1 or Day 2 pick following Bo Nix and Dillon Gabriel.WATCH: No. 7 Oregon vs. No. 15 USC | 3:30 p.m. ET Saturday, CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App (free), Paramount+ PremiumA 36-year-old Kentucky native who spent most of his coaching infancy in Texas, Stein is a coach on the rise. He's a name to know in one of the wildest coaching cycles in recent memory and the author of four top-20 offenses in four seasons as a play-caller between UTSA and Oregon. \n\"Dude tries to score,\" Traylor said. \"I know you're thinking, 'Everyone tries to score.' No. Will Stein tries to SCORE. He ain't scared.\" \n        \n            \n                College football odds, picks, predictions: USC vs. Oregon, Pitt vs. Georgia Tech deliver Week 13 playoff buzz\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA play-calling experiment in Austin  After a brief flirtation with law school or a career in real estate, Stein stayed with Louisville as a GA following his playing career. Then Charlie Strong got the Texas job. He and offensive coordinator Shawn Watson asked Stein to come with them as a quality control coach. Stein arrived around the same time as Traylor -- Texas' tight ends coach in 2015 and 2016 -- and they ended up living together in Traylor's uncle's house. Traylor was away from his family. Stein was a broke kid a few years out of college. They became so close Traylor considers him like a son. \nWhen Texas fired Strong, Tom Herman opted to keep Stein on staff. The Longhorns played in the 2017 Texas Bowl in Herman's debut. During bowl prep Tim Beck -- now the head coach at Coastal Carolina -- granted Stein's request to call plays for the scout team during their scrimmage portion of practice. \"I had an itch to call it,\" Stein said. After that season Stein had a decision about what was next. He'd been an off-field coach for five years. He wanted to take the next step. His girlfriend, now wife, Darby also loved Austin and didn't want to leave. So, Stein turned down a position job at Northern Iowa. Nothing really called him to leave the Longhorns.That is until Lake Travis had an offensive coordinator opening. For those unversed in Texas high school football lore, Lake Travis is a quarterback mecca. Everyone from Baker Mayfield to Garrett Gilbert and Todd Reesing have come through the annual state power located in the Austin suburbs. \nCarter interviewed at least 10 people for the job. He didn't love any of them. That's when he got a call from two friends: Former Texas High School Relations director Hardee McCrary and Traylor, who both recommend Stein. \"I sat down with him and not a minute in I was like, 'This is our guy. There's no doubt,'\" Carter said. Stein described his time as the offensive coordinator at Lake Travis as one of experimentation. High school coaches teach in Texas. Stein would sneak into his office while teaching PE to watch tape and script practice. The next year he was assigned the in-school suspension class (ISS), and he'd grind tape while the kids sat in silent punishment for the day. \nThose Lake Travis teams did not lack talent. His triggerman was eventual Texas and Purdue quarterback Hudson Card, who threw to NFL superstar receiver Garrett Wilson. But you don't pick your all your players in high school, and there were times Lake Travis was overmatched in 6A football and Stein found out how it felt to \"get our asses kicked.\" \"It taught me how to be creative with our players,\" Stein said. \"You've got what you got in high school football.\" Carter loved working with Stein. The pair are still good friends, and Carter will never forget how he lost him. Traylor called Carter, amid a playoff run, with some news: \"Brother, you're not going to believe it, but I'm about to get the UTSA job.\" \nCarter was thrilled. He'd known Traylor for years. Then Traylor hit him with the bad news. \"I'm taking Will,\" Traylor said. \"I was like, 'Eff you, you sorry motherf---er,\" Carter remembers with a huge laugh. \"It was great.\" Oregon quarterback Dante Moore could become the third Day 1 or Day 2 NFL draft pick developed by Ducks offensive coordinator Will Stein. \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Stein the play caller Stein served as UTSA's pass game coordinator for two years before being elevated to offensive coordinator in 2022. Here's how his offenses have ranked in points per game over the last four years:\n2022 (UTSA): 14th 2023 (Oregon): 2nd 2024 (Oregon): 17th  2025 (Oregon): 7thScore Stein does. Now, here's his starting quarterback's completion percentage every year he's been a college play-caller: 2022 (Frank Harrs): 69.6%  2023 (Bo Nix): 77.4%  2024 (Dillon Gabriel): 72.9%  2025 (Dante Moore): 72.8%That's a career high for each of those passers. In Nix's case it's the single most accurate season in college football history. Gabriel and Moore, if his season ended today, would rank in the top 30 all time. Those are four different quarterbacks with different skill sets -- Stein would be quick to add \"high-level\" skill sets -- who all hit their accuracy zenith under Stein. Part of that is Stein's guiding philosophy as a coordinator: \"We play common sense football.\"  \nYou play Cover 2 with the safeties set deep, Stein is probably going to call a run or teach his quarterback to take the underneath throws that allow Oregon's playmakers to create yardage in space. If opponents press with a single-high safety, Stein is going to call a shot over the top.Stein completed 70% of his passes under his high school offensive coordinator Andrew Coverdale. Teddy Bridgewater led the ACC in completion percentage his final two years under Watson. Carter's Lake Travis offenses prioritize accuracy. It's a foundational element of Stein's football education and what he thinks contributes to winning football. \"He understands the (quarterback) position,\" Traylor said. \"He asks kids to do what they do naturally do well. He's not going to make his quarterbacks do what they don't like to do. His scheme is quarterback friendly.\" Oregon is a big-play offense. The Ducks have the second-most plays of 20-plus yards in the country this year. It's a product of the Ducks' overwhelming speed and explosiveness. Stein is proud of that production. What might explain Oregon's offensive production best, however, is the relentless down-to-down efficiency. Stein likes to think of play-calling as a batting average. The more first downs you get, the higher chance you have of winning the game. Nobody does that better than Oregon.The Ducks rank first in the Power Four in three-and-punt percentage (6.5%), first in drives without a first down (15.7%) and fifth nationally in offensive success rate.Stein said everyone views second-and-short as a shot down. He can't help but think: Why not just get another set of downs? \"It's the commonsense approach for me,\" Stein said. \"That's something we preach. Keep us in the green mentality and we have another set of four downs.\" \n        \n            \n                Meet the candidates -- 88 of them: The only list you need for college football's wildest coaching carousel\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA head coaching future? Oregon is amid another playoff push and Moore is on the cusp of emerging as the Ducks' next drafted signal caller. People notice that success, and often that will create opportunities for the coordinators on staff. And Stein is often thrown out as a head coaching candidate this cycle.Those who know him well view it as only a matter of time. \"As soon as Coach Traylor stole him from me and took him back to college, I knew he'd be a head coach before long,\" Carter said. Stein admits being a head coach is a goal of his just like he had the itch to call plays as a QC eight years ago. That doesn't mean he'll take the usual or obvious path. Stein didn't want to leave Austin, leading to a two-year high school detour that changed his career. Stein loves being in Eugene and is in no rush to leave, so he can be selective about future head coaching opportunities. \"Winning solves a lot, and when you win, there's enough for everybody,\" Stein said. \"When you lose, there's not enough for anybody. That's an old Jeff Traylor quote, and it's so true. \"My singular focus is this team and the next steps. If I'm fortunate enough to get there in my career, it will be great. But I'm in an unbelievable spot and have the best support in the country, and work for the best head coach in the country, getting to coach the best quarterbacks in the country, with the best line, receivers and running backs. And there's a lot that is good about that situation. It allows me to just be where my feet are, and the focus on this and the focus on this process and let the results take care of themselves.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 coaching carousel has quickly become one of the most dramatic and unpredictable cycles in recent memory, with multiple blue-blood programs making seismic moves in search of stability, identity, and a path back to national relevance. LSU, Florida, Penn State, and Auburn all enter the market with differing agendas but a shared reality: each believes its vacancy is the kind of job that can -- and should -- attract top-tier candidates capable of winning immediately. But the truth is that even the sport's biggest brands need legitimate contingency plans. With competition heating up, political forces shaping searches, and several schools targeting the same top names, identifying the right \"Plan B\" may ultimately determine which programs regain their footing and which ones fall further behind.Below is a breakdown of the most logical secondary options for each major opening, a closer look at which names offer the best fit if a program's top target doesn't come through.\n    \n                                        \n    LSUPresumed Top Target: Lane Kiffin, Ole MissPlan B: Jon Sumrall,  TulaneThe Bayou Bengals and their circle of decision-makers wasted little time cutting ties with Brian Kelly after an embarrassing loss to Mike Elko and Texas A&M in Death Valley. But nearly a month later, LSU's coaching search has been anything but conventional. The college football world has been given a front-row seat to just how intertwined Louisiana politics and LSU athletics can be when it comes to hiring and firing a head coach.\n\n        \n            \n                The Politics of Purple and Gold: How Gov. Jeff Landry's power play took down LSU's AD -- and what comes next\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith a new University president and athletics director in place since Kelly's dismissal in October, the Tigers have shifted their attention toward Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin, hoping the once-embattled coach will be the one to lead their program into its next era. But with Kiffin steering a talented Ole Miss roster toward what could be the program's first College Football Playoff appearance -- and with Florida positioned as a legitimate contender for his services -- LSU must begin exploring alternatives.One of those intriguing alternatives resides just 80 miles down the road, where Tulane head coach Jon Sumrall has posted a 17–7 record in his two seasons leading the Green Wave. At age 43, the former Kentucky linebacker is no stranger to the SEC, cutting his teeth with the Wildcats as both a player and graduate assistant before later spending time as a position coach in both Lexington and Oxford.Now four years into his head-coaching career, which includes a brief but highly successful stint at Troy, where he led the Trojans to back-to-back double-digit win seasons for the first time since 2018, Sumrall embodies the type of youth and upside LSU hasn't tapped into since hiring a 48-year-old head coach from Michigan State named Nick Saban.\nWhile there's a sensible case for Sumrall to make the short jump from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, his limited Power Four head-coaching experience means he'd need significant support -- a strong player-personnel infrastructure, aggressive NIL backing, and full administrative alignment -- to build a roster and staff capable of competing for national titles while continuing to grow on the job.All areas where LSU is more than capable of delivering. And if the Tigers swing and miss on Lane Kiffin, Sumrall becomes a far more compelling alternative so long as the school can swallow \"hiring the Tulane coach.\" Sumrall understands the internal dynamics of Louisiana, the realities of the SEC footprint, and brings the kind of long-term stability and upward trajectory LSU's decision-makers and fanbase have been chasing through a revolving door of head coaches. For a program searching for a sustainable answer rather than another short-term patch, Sumrall presents a credible, forward-facing vision for the future in Baton Rouge.\n    \n                                        \n    FloridaPresumed Top Target: Lane Kiffin, Ole MissPlan B: Brent Key, Georgia TechAfter hiring Billy Napier out of the Group of Five just a few years ago, it now appears increasingly likely that Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin will shift his attention toward a more experienced and established presence to lead the Gators back to national prominence. And much like LSU, Florida is expected to be a major player in the rapidly developing sweepstakes for Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin.\nWith Kiffin weighing multiple opportunities -- including the possibility of continuing to build his legacy in Oxford -- Stricklin needs to thoroughly evaluate alternatives outside of this cycle's most coveted coaching candidate. Florida's short list will almost certainly feature names like Missouri's Eli Drinkwitz, Washington's Jedd Fisch and Georgia Tech's Brent Key.Unlike the play-calling pedigrees of Drinkwitz and Fisch, Key has built his reputation in the trenches, dating back to his playing days as an offensive lineman at Georgia Tech and his early coaching tenure under George O'Leary at UCF. After assuming interim leadership following Geoff Collins's dismissal during the 2022 season, Key steadied a spiraling Yellow Jackets program, guiding them to a 4–4 finish and earning the removal of his interim tag.Since then, Key has delivered back-to-back 7–6 seasons while methodically reshaping Georgia Tech's roster, culture, and expectations -- progress that helped lay the foundation for the Yellow Jackets' current 8–1 start and legitimate push toward the College Football Playoff.\nFor Florida, Key represents the type of no-nonsense presence and cultural stabilizer Stricklin thought he landed with Napier but could ultimately find in the Georgia Tech head coach. In short order, Key has shown he understands how to build in the modern era of roster turnover, squeeze more out of less, and create a trench-first identity that aligns with what's required to compete at the highest level of the sport. And although he may not be the flashiest name in this coaching carousel, Key -- not unlike Texas A&M's hire of Mike Elko -- has shown a clear understanding of what winning looks like and how to elevate a program that traditionally operates with fewer built-in advantages. That blueprint translates cleanly to Gainesville.\n    \n                                        \n    Penn StatePreferred Top Target: TBDPlan B: Clark Lea, VanderbiltThe Nittany Lions elected to part ways with James Franklin after three consecutive losses -- all in games where Penn State entered as the betting favorite against Oregon, UCLA, and Northwestern. Only a year removed from a College Football Playoff semifinal appearance, athletic director Pat Kraft now faces the difficult task of moving on from a longtime program anchor and identifying a leader capable of delivering the national championship Penn State has spent decades chasing.With Penn State alumnus and Nebraska head coach Matt Rhule signing an extension to remain in Lincoln for the foreseeable future, Kraft's search for Franklin's successor has grown more ambiguous, leaving the direction of the Nittany Lions' coaching hunt increasingly difficult to predict.\nCan we again interest Penn State in hiring the Vanderbilt head coach? Enter Clark Lea.Now in his fifth season at the helm of the Commodores, the 44-year-old Nashville native has guided Vanderbilt to an 8–2 record this year, just a season removed from delivering the program's first bowl victory in more than a decade. After enduring two 2–10 campaigns in his first three years, Lea has elevated Vanderbilt from SEC bottom-dweller to one of the league's most respectable and well-run programs.Re-energized by the additions of veteran quarterback Diego Pavia, offensive coordinator Tim Beck and chief consultant Jerry Kill, Lea has shown a rare ability to diagnose shortcomings within his program and address them head-on. His willingness to adapt and evolve -- in an era defined by roster turnover, portal volatility, and razor-thin margins -- represents exactly the traits required to build and sustain success in modern college football. Lea has the conviction and steadiness of a coach uniquely equipped to meet Penn State's expectations and build a sustainable championship contender in Happy Valley.\n\n    \n                                        \n    AuburnPreferred Top Target: Jon Sumrall, TulanePlan B: Eli Drinkwitz, MissouriAfter assembling a highly talented roster that continued to fall short of expectations year after year, Auburn athletic director John Cohen made the swift decision to move on from Hugh Freeze midway through his third season. Once again, the Tigers find themselves searching for a head coach capable of restoring a storied program to national relevance.Much like Florida, Auburn offers one of the most attractive \"win-now\" opportunities in this cycle, highlighted by a talented core of young defenders who have logged invaluable reps over the past two seasons under the direction and development of defensive coordinator -- and now interim head coach -- D.J. Durkin.And when surveying the field beyond Tulane's Jon Sumrall and in-house candidate Durkin, Missouri head coach Eli Drinkwitz presents Cohen with the rare comfort of a strong offensive résumé and established SEC experience. Over the last three seasons in Columbia, Drinkwitz has guided the Tigers to a 27–8 record, highlighted by an 11-win campaign and a Cotton Bowl victory over Ohio State in 2023.\nAlthough skeptics will point to Missouri's inability to beat a Top 25 SEC opponent over the past two years, Drinkwitz has undeniably elevated the Tigers' overall talent profile since taking over in 2020. Missouri is now positioned for a potential third consecutive nine-win season for the first time since joining the SEC and could have been in the CFP mix if not for injuries to its first- and second-string quarterbacks. Of the current head-coaching vacancies, none may be more primed for immediate success than Auburn -- and the possibility of retaining a coordinator like Durkin only strengthens the job's appeal for an opportunistic Drinkwitz. The Tigers offer a familiar recruiting footprint, a competitive NIL infrastructure, and a roster far closer to contention than recent results suggest. For a coach who has already shown he can elevate a program without the geographical advantages he'd inherit on the Plains, the opportunity to establish instant credibility -- both with the fanbase and inside one of the country's most fertile recruiting regions -- could be a powerful pull.\n            ",

But he should get back on track against the Colts.Mahomes was bad against the Bills in Week 9 and the Broncos in Week 11, but those were two tough opponents on the road. At home, Mahomes has scored at least 24.1 Fantasy points in each outing, and he should do well against Indianapolis.\nThe Colts have struggled against every quality quarterback they have faced this season, including Bo Nix (26.2 Fantasy points), Matthew Stafford (33.4), Jacoby Brissett (24.7) and Justin Herbert (33.9). Mahomes should follow suit, and he's a top-five quarterback in the majority of leagues for Week 12.\nQBs to Start\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n                            Sportsline\n                        \n                    \n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        LAR\n                    \n                         \n                        L.A.

I expect him to get back on track in Week 12 against the Buccaneers, who just allowed Drake Maye and Josh Allen to combine for 70.7 Fantasy points in the past two games. Prior to facing the Seahawks, Stafford scored at least 31.6 Fantasy points in three consecutive home games, and Tampa Bay's defense should struggle to contain the Rams passing attack in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        ARI\n                    \n

Kyler Murray (foot) in Week 6. He's attempted at least 44 passes in three of those games, and he has two outings with at least 320 yards. This week, Brissett faces a Jaguars defense that has allowed at least 21.7 Fantasy points to six of their past seven opposing quarterbacks, including four guys scoring at least 28.7 points. I like Brissett as a top-10 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues in Week 12.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        SF\n                    \n                         \n                        San Francisco\n                    \n                                            • #13\n                                            \n                                            Age: 25\n                                                                        • Experience: 4 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        CAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    SF -7\n                                    O/U 48.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                24.6\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                10th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    786\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    23\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    4\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    22.8\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Purdy looked great in his return from a six-game absence with a toe injury in Week 11 at Arizona with 25.3 Fantasy points on 19-of-26 passing for 200 yards and three touchdowns. He's now scored at least 20.8 Fantasy points in all three starts that he's made this season, and he should have another solid outing against the Panthers. Carolina is No. 11 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, but Drake Maye, Tua Tagovailoa, Dak Prescott and Josh Allen all scored at least 26.1 Fantasy points against the Panthers. Purdy should follow suit, and he has top-10 upside in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        DAL\n                    \n                         \n                        Dallas\n                    \n                                            • #4\n                                            \n                                            Age: 32\n                                                                        • Experience: 10 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    vs\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        PHI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    PHI -3.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                8th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                17.9\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                9th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2587\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    117\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    22\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    6\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    23.5\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Prescott only scored 7.8 Fantasy points at Philadelphia in Week 1, and the Eagles have limited Jordan Love and Jared Goff to a combined 21.9 Fantasy points in the past two weeks. This is a tough defense, but Prescott has scored at least 26.1 Fantasy points in three of four home games this season. He also scored at least 21.9 Fantasy points against Philadelphia in five games in a row prior Week 1, and Prescott is averaging 27.3 Fantasy points against the Eagles in his past three meetings against them in Dallas. I trust Prescott as a No. 1 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        TB\n                    \n                         \n                        Tampa Bay\n                    \n                                            • #6\n                                            \n                                            Age: 30\n                                                                        • Experience: 8 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        LAR\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    LAR -6.5\n                                    O/U 49.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                6th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                19.6\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                11th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2365\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    197\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    18\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    3\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    21.4\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Mayfield is coming off a down game at Buffalo with just 18.8 Fantasy points, and he's been under 20 points in three of his past four games, all on the road. The Rams also just held Sam Darnold to 4.3 Fantasy points and rank No. 6 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks. So why are we starting Mayfield? He has done well in tough matchups this season at Houston (23.9), vs. Philadelphia (22.9), at Seattle (30.7) and vs. New England (28.9), and this feels like a shootout between Mayfield and Matthew Stafford. I'm still going to trust Mayfield as a No. 1 quarterback in this game.\n            \n            \n\nSleepers (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n                        \n

Williams, and that duo combined for just 28.9 Fantasy points, which included only one passing touchdown and each quarterback throwing for less than 200 yards. Love scored 21.7 Fantasy points at the Giants in Week 11, but prior to that, he combined for 16.8 Fantasy points in two games against Carolina and Philadelphia. Love is also averaging just 15.7 Fantasy points in five home games this season, and he should only be started in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in Week 12.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        IND\n                    \n                         \n                        Indianapolis\n                    \n                                            • #17\n                                            \n                                            Age: 28\n                                                                        • Experience: 7 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        KC\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    KC -3.5\n                                    O/U 49.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                10th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                18\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                15th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2659\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    143\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    20\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    7\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    22.2\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Jones went into his bye in Week 11 having scored 17.5 Fantasy points or less in consecutive games against the Steelers and Falcons.

Jones should only be started in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues.\n            \n            \n\n\n    \n                    \n    \n                                        \n        \n                 \n                        JAC\n                    \n                         \n                        Jacksonville\n                    \n                                            • #16\n                                            \n                                            Age: 26\n                                                                        • Experience: 5 yrs.\n                                                \n        \n    \n    \n        \n                            \n                                                                                                                    \n                            \n                                \n                                    Weekly Breakdown\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                        \n                                                                                                                                \n                                                                    \n                                        MATCHUP\n                                    \n                                                                \n                                    @\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        ARI\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                                    JAC -2.5\n                                    O/U 47.5\n                                \n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    OPP VS QB\n                                \n                                7th\n                            \n                                                        \n                                \n                                    PROJ PTS\n                                \n                                20.2\n                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                \n                                    QB RNK\n                                \n                                18th\n                            \n                                            \n                \n                    \n        \n                \n                                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    YTD Stats\n                                \n                            \n                        \n                                            \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        PAYDS\n                                    \n                                    2151\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        RUYDS\n                                    \n                                    181\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        TD\n                                    \n                                    16\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        INT\n                                    \n                                    8\n                                \n                                                            \n                                    \n                                        FPTS/G\n                                    \n                                    18\n                                \n                                                    \n                                    \n                    \n                    \n                Lawrence scored 17 Fantasy points in Week 11 against the Chargers, and he's now been under 20 Fantasy points in three of his past four games. We'll see if Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle) and Brenton Strange (hip) play for the Jaguars in Week 12, but this is a tough matchup against the Cardinals. Arizona is No. 7 in fewest Fantasy points allowed to opposing quarterbacks, and the only guys with more than 20 points against the Cardinals were Bryce Young, Daniel Jones and Brock Purdy, which also includes matchups against Sam Darnold twice, Jordan Love and Dak Prescott. I would only start Lawrence in Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in Week 12.\n            \n            \n\nBust Alert (Start/Sit)\n                        Projections powered by\n

Fantasy points, and it was the third time in his past five games where he failed to score a touchdown. The Steelers defense has also improved greatly of late in holding Daniel Jones, Justin Herbert and Joe Flacco to 16.7 Fantasy points or less in three games in a row. Williams will hopefully be productive enough to be trusted as a low-end starter in the majority of leagues, but I would sit him if you can. Pittsburgh's defense will harass Williams enough to where he should have another down game in Week 12. I would prefer to start him in just Superflex and two-quarterback leagues in this matchup.\n            \n            \n\n            \n    \n\n        \n\n    \n            \n    \n            \n\n

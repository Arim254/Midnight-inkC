Both teams have overwhelmingly favored the Under this season, as it is 9-4 for Carolina and 8-5 for Florida State. The Tar Heels have failed to reach the total in six of their last seven games, while the recent matchup history has also been taken into account. The team's last five meetings have seen under 160 points scored in four of them as they've averaged 155.4 combined points.As the heavy favorites, UNC is expected to dictate the style of play, and the Heels are a defense-first team this season. They rank 16th, nationally, in points allowed per game but sit outside the top 100 in points scored per game. As for FSU, it leads the ACC with 9.8 steals per game, so many of its defensive possessions don't even end with a shot attempt by the opponent. With these factors, the Under hits well over 60% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time. You can only see that pick at SportsLine.So who wins UNC vs. FSU, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Major League Baseball offseason is ongoing and, with the new year just around the bend, we're working our way deeper into the sport's offseason calendar. Among other things, the winter in baseball means a steady supply of rumors regarding free agent signings, trades, and the like. Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's roundup just below. Hazen expects end to Marte trade rumors 'shortly'Mike Hazen, the Diamondbacks' top baseball operations executive, is ready to move on from trade talks involving second baseman Ketel Marte. Hazen said Tuesday that he anticipates putting \"an end\" to negotiations \"shortly.\" How shortly? \"I haven't figured that out yet,\" Hazen told MLB.com. \"But this isn't going to continue to linger. We need to focus on our offseason. Again, my gut this whole time was that [a Marte trade] wasn't going to happen, and I think it seems likely that that's the case and we want to focus on other things we need to do.\"Marte, 32, is a three-time All-Star who is under contract through at least the 2030 season. He's been subject to trade rumors this winter after raising the ire of his teammates last season. The Diamondbacks have been tied to free-agent third baseman Alex Bregman, with some reports suggesting Arizona would be open to keeping Marte even if they land Bregman.\nReds still hoping to add outfielderThe Reds have already this offseason added outfielder JJ Bleday via free agency and outfielder Dane Myers via trade. Even so, Cincy is still in the market for outfield help, the Athletic reports. The Reds are likely to do that via trade, and more specifically they'll look to deal from the rotation in order to get another outfielder to put in their mix for 2026 and beyond. The Reds are coming off a 2025 campaign in which they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in a full season since 2013. However, they claimed the third and final wild-card spot in the National League despite an offense that ranked 26th in the majors in OPS+. Marlins, Dodgers pull off minor tradeThe Marlins have acquired outfielder Esteury Ruiz from the Dodgers in exchange for right-handed prospect Adriano Marrero, Miami announced on Monday evening. To make room for Ruiz on the 40-player roster, the Marlins designated infielder Eric Wagaman for assignment. \nRuiz, 26, has a .639 OPS and a -1.2 WAR across parts of four MLB seasons. In 2023 as a member of the A's, he led the American League with 67 stolen bases. Marrero, 18, worked 33 innings in the Dominican Summer League last season, his first in professional baseball. Okamoto in U.S. as posting window nears endJapanese first baseman Kazuma Okamoto, in keeping with the rules of the MLB-NPB posting system, must sign by 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Jan. 4., when his 45-day posting window closes. With the clock running out, Okamoto is now in the U.S. to visit interested teams in person, Yahoo Japan reports. The Pirates, Padres, and Angels have previously been reported to have some level of interest in Okamoto.We ranked Okamoto, 29, as the 22nd-best free agent available this offseason. He's spent his entire career with the Yomiuri Giants and hit .322/.411/.581 with 15 home runs in 77 games around an injury to his non-throwing elbow in 2025. Okamoto has played third base most of his career, though he's seen more action at first in recent years, and is expected to stay there long-term.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Golden State Warriors celebrated Christmas in style with a 126-116 win over the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 25. But while picking up a victory in front of a large television audience was a prime opportunity for the Warriors to prove that they are still one of the NBA's top teams, Draymond Green said it was also a double-edged sword.Green lamented the human element of playing on Christmas Day, saying that it \"f----ing sucks\" to be away from family for most of the holiday. Few active players are as qualified to speak on the reality of Dec. 25 games than Green, who played his 11th Christmas game this year.\"Yes, it is an honor to be considered one of the great draws that is in the NBA,\" Green said on his podcast, \"The Draymond Green Show.\" \"To play on a day where everybody's watching is incredible. All of those things are great. But two things can be true at once. Playing on Christmas Day also f---ing sucks. The reason it sucks is, number one, it can affect your mood. Number two, we are human beings and, just like everyone else, enjoy Christmas Day with their families. That kind of gets messed up for us.\"Green is not the only NBA star to speak up about the reality of Christmas games this year. Before he appeared in his record 20th Dec. 25 game, LeBron James said he would \"much rather be at home with my family.\" That honesty raised eyebrows and generated pushback from some fans who noted that playing on the holiday is essentially a badge of honor.\n\"I hate when people are like, 'It's an honor to play on Christmas Day. People should shut up,'\" Green said. \"No, you should shut up.\"Green posted seven points in the win over the Mavericks and was outscored by even of his Warriors teammates. It was his fourth consecutive game with single-digit points.\"For all of those who are like, 'You should be honored' -- honored to miss your family time?\" Green said. \"Honored to miss your kids opening gifts? Honored to leave your kid and go to work? Because no one works on Christmas Day. We're going to work. Everybody says it's this great honor. I just want to give you a little perspective. It's a great honor to go to work on Christmas Day?\"\nThere were five games on the NBA's 2025 Christmas Day schedule, and they delivered the high entertainment value that typically comes with the league's holiday slate. The most significant result of the day was the San Antonio Spurs' 117-102 statement win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, which asserted Victor Wembanyama and his squad as championship contenders. And in the nightcap, Nikola Jokić and Anthony Edwards combined for 100 points in a 142-138 overtime thriller between the Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- In the afterglow of this exceptional triumph, it is perhaps worth reflecting on how implausible such a result might have seemed a quarter hour through. Given that so many of Arsenal's recent wins by one-goal margins have been batterings in disguise, perhaps it is appropriate that obliterating a paper tiger of a title contender should see the Gunners dodge a rather nasty paper cut.It is not so much that Aston Villa were necessarily better than Arsenal in the Gunners' 4-1 win on Tuesday. Their win wasn't inevitable. It certainly seemed, however, that Unai Emery had Mikel Arteta's number. Villa would absorb the strength of the first press, find a way of drawing Arsenal out of position and spring their transition threats.Ollie Watkins continued to torment his boyhood club, his ability to spin out of duels making for a forward who can get as much joy against William Saliba as anyone else. As they had three and a half weeks ago, Villa found ways to get Watkins quick ball in behind and he found ways to get shots away. Before the weirdness of garbage time, Arsenal had only allowed one shot worth over 0.5 xG in a Premier League game this season. That had gone to Watkins at Villa Park and he followed that up with an almost as frustrating miss early on, contriving to skew wide after brilliant work to get him into a scoring position.The muscularity with which Ezri Konsa stripped possession from Viktor Gyokeres and the precision of the pass that followed exemplified the excellence of Villa's start. Emery knew which duels his team were going to dominate and this game had a way of funnelling itself into the positions ,that would allow them to impose themselves. There are few players even in the Premier League who Mikel Merino bounces off. In the first half he could get no purchase on Amadou Onana, the press beater in chief. He was at his dynamic best and Arsenal were without the one player who might have been able to stop him, Declan Rice sidelined with a minor knee injury. Even if Rice had been blown by, he would have had the recovery pace to win the second duel. When Merino was taken out of a move, he was not coming back.\nPerhaps if Onana had been able to make it back out for the second half, this game would have been different. \"Maybe it didn't help us that Onana is injured,\" said Emery. \"He is important for us in set pieces and in the middle.\" That loss of fizz through the middle, already lessened due to the suspension of Boubacar Kamara, hit hard. Before Onana's exit there was a very real risk that the verticality of Villa's passing would rip through the Arsenal backline. \nThe hosts found themselves in an almighty bind. They are a very good pressing team and it is the right thing for very good pressing teams to push for those high regains. That much would be apparent in the second half, but in the first, the margins were razor-thin.  Gabriel chased Morgan Rogers right into the heart of the Villa area. He was inches away from a steal that would surely have led to Martin Odegaard's opener. Instead, he couldn't quite nick the ball, and in a flash, Onana was driving up the field. Had he not sold himself short with a blatant dive, he might have been able to create an even better chance for Villa than the ones they spurned.Arteta knew the danger his team were in. \"The moment you allow them to attack your back is a big problem because they have runners from inside, they have people that can pick up passes from deep positions, they have players in the last line that are excellent at making the runs, pulling shoulders and attacking your backs. And you have to control that because every time you give the ball away, they have the capacity to do that,\" he said. With 45 minutes played, it rather felt like Arsenal were playing with fire. In the second, they strode purposefully onto the coals. There were adjustments to the press, what Arteta termed some \"behaviors\" changing. There was no consideration given, however, to what might have seemed the most natural response of any coach in that position. No dialling down. No stepping back. Arsenal would chase the ball with even more intensity, commit even more in pursuit of the regains. \n\"I really like that,\" said Arteta, \"because you're going to go through different patches and periods against top opposition like Villa and then you still have the ability to come out on the game and deserve to win it.\"The opener might not have come from Arsenal's chasing -- set piece again, set piece again as they say 'round these parts -- but the killer second was a vindication of their aggression. Youri Tielemans might have thought he had broken through the lines but slamming into Jadon Sancho like a toddler in a bumper car came Odegaard, who recovered possession more frequently than anyone on the pitch tonight. Dancing feet took him away from John McGinn and suddenly those gaps up the gut that Villa had been exploiting were opening up for them. Martin Zubimendi cruised through.\n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            All that was needed from then on was to restore some xG balance to the world. For most of December, Arsenal couldn't hit a barn door from six yards out. Of course, the month ended with Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Jesus bending them in from the edge of the area. Scoring returns from range that even Steph Curry couldn't keep up propelled Villa on a title tilt, they ended this game scoring one of the three <0.8 xG shots they took.\nEven with those unmissable chances Villa found a way to spurn, they still somehow ended up outperformed on the xG front. Rarely does a statistic so compellingly speak to the difference between two teams. Even when Arsenal indulged their madness, they couldn't make themselves the inferior team. Even when their plan seemed so ill-suited to their opponents, they were simply able to do it better and prove themselves to be greatly superior.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The story in college basketball over the past week hasn't been the incredible number of quality teams at the top of the polls this season. Instead, everyone has turned their focus to Baylor adding James Nnaji to their roster. Nnaji was the 31st overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft -- the first pick of the second round -- but never signed an NBA contract. He appeared in Summer League with the Charlotte Hornets but opted to stay and play professionally overseas rather than make the leap to the NBA. Nnaji's addition created quite the stir, as some legendary coaches decried the state of college hoops that would allow him eligibility, while Scott Drew defended and detailed his decision to add Nnaji to CBS Sports' Matt Norlander recently. Amid all of that outcry, NCAA president Charlie Baker released a statement on Tuesday confirming the NCAA will not allow any players who have signed an NBA contract -- including a two-way deal -- to have college eligibility, while detailing why the NCAA isn't fighting Nnaji's case. \nThe NCAA has not and will not grant eligibility to any prospective or returning student-athletes who have signed an NBA contract (including a two-way contract). As schools are increasingly recruiting individuals with international league experience, the NCAA is exercising discretion in applying the actual and necessary expenses bylaw to ensure that prospective student-athletes with experience in American basketball leagues are not at a disadvantage compared to their international counterparts. Rules have long permitted schools to enroll and play individuals with no prior collegiate experience midyear.  While the NCAA has prevailed on the vast majority of eligibility-related lawsuits, recent outlier decisions enjoining the NCAA on a nationwide basis from enforcing rules that have been on the books for decades -- without even having a trial -- are wildly destabilizing. I will be working with DI leaders in the weeks ahead to protect college basketball from these misguided attempts to destroy this American institution.The ending of the statement offers a glimpse into why the NCAA has weakened its stance recently and been more reluctant to draw some of the hard lines long-time coaches are calling for. The NCAA's great fear is having a court case completely undo longtime rules and the organization's entire structure. As players have become increasingly successful getting injunctions against the organization that allow them to play, the NCAA has been forced to pick its battles more carefully to avoid a disastrous court outcome. The real change for college basketball is that they are now a competitor with overseas leagues for talent who would've otherwise stayed professional in Europe or elsewhere for financial reasons. Now that players can get paid to play college hoops, more players are considering the option to come stateside before trying to move on to the NBA. \nNnaji being 22 years old and a former No. 31 overall pick makes his case stand out from other former overseas pros who have made the move to college ball, but he will almost assuredly not be the last. The real concern for the NCAA is if a young player who had a brief NBA career and signed an actual contract wants to challenge the eligibility rules via the courts. That's where the NCAA is willing to draw the line for now, but at some point someone will try to be the first to make that move. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL scriptwriters have done it again. This was supposed to be a rebuilding or retooling year for the 49ers. They went 6-11 last year, succumbing to injuries and the all-too-familiar Super Bowl loser hangover, as they were mentally drained from another heartbreaking finish. They lost over a third of their starters in one of the biggest offseason exoduses in NFL history after giving Brock Purdy a five-year deal worth $265 million.Nobody would have blamed them for hovering around .500 this year. Purdy missed eight games with turf toe. Brandon Aiyuk has not played. George Kittle missed a handful of games, and Nick Bosa and Fred Warner suffered season-ending injuries (well, maybe not for Warner).Instead of folding, the 49ers can earn the top seed in the NFC with a win on Saturday against the Seahawks. Kyle Shanahan is in his bag and a contender for NFL coach of the year. Christian McCaffrey could win Offensive Player of the Year and Comeback Player of the Year. And perhaps most importantly, Purdy is playing the best football of his career.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 18 Power Rankings: Kyle Shanahan coaching the season of his life as 49ers keep winning without stars\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe script around Purdy's career is just brilliant. The character arc is fascinating, and the narratives have gone something like this:\n2022: Holy crap, Mr. Irrelevant is good!2023: I can't believe he's an MVP candidate BUT he's also a game manager and a YAC merchant.2024: See, I told you he was only a game manager.2025: Holy crap, he's actually really, really good (but still struggles like all great players do).The debates (and scrutiny) around Purdy have been about as polarizing as those around Jalen Hurts, Dak Prescott and Justin Herbert in recent years. But Sunday night was something of a mic drop (with a Dougie). It was a critic silencer, a debate ender.\nThere have been two sides to the Purdy \"game manager\" narrative in recent years. Either you thought he was only good because of an all-world supporting cast and Shanahan's system. Or you thought he excelled in Shanahan's system because he was an elite processor with accurate, anticipatory throws who could occasionally put the team on his back when needed.I've been on the fence at times and a Purdy believer on other occasions, but I think these sides can come together and hash out what Purdy is, and what he is not.\nPurdy is not a game manager\nPurdy is the first quarterback in 49ers history (one with a few decent quarterbacks!) with at least five total touchdowns in back-to-back games. All of a sudden, it doesn't seem so undeserved that he is the NFL's all-time leader in passer rating (104.8) among quarterbacks with 1,000-plus attempts. It's actually pretty legit that he leads the NFL in EPA per dropback (0.21) since he was the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft. Sure, Shanahan was riding on cloud nine Sunday night, but this is not the way someone talks about a game manager.\"I thought Brock had a hell of a game, again,\" Shanahan said after the win. \"Brock's been playing his ass off, made some huge plays in this game, kept some drives alive with his legs, made some off-schedule plays, and was an assassin out there throughout the whole day.\"I never thought I'd hear someone call Purdy an \"assassin,\" but I was in agreement as my jaw dropped to the floor following his touchdown pass to Kyle Juszczyk against the Bears.\nPurdy missed eight games with turf toe this year, but he still has enough plays to qualify on the NFL's passing leaderboards. His ranks are astounding. He's second in EPA per dropback (0.24), behind Drake Maye (0.27), and he leads the NFL in success rate (56%).The 49ers are 6-0 since he returned from injury, and they lead the NFL in points per game (35.7), points per drive (3.39) and third-down conversion percentage (59%) during that span. As you can imagine, Purdy (71% completion rate, 19 total touchdowns, 111.9 passer rating in the past six games) has a lot to do with it.It's an incredible rebound for a player who was understandably doubted in the past year and a half as he struggled to put the 49ers on his back while injuries and adversity mounted. What a difference a month makes in how an athlete can be perceived. What we are seeing now is simply a really good quarterback playing the best football of his career.\nHe's doing everything the detractors said he couldn't do. He's elevating a team when the deck is stacked against him. The 49ers have a really bad defense (last in the NFL in sacks and 26th in defensive EPA). They are undermanned (fourth-most games missed due to injury this season). Yet Purdy is coming up clutch, airing it out, extending plays despite all of that, and doing it with bravado.Purdy can win without a superstar supporting castIt's understandable why Purdy was a polarizing figure in 2023. He nearly won MVP while leading the NFL in YAC per completion. He was a play away from winning a Super Bowl. Yet how much of it was because of Purdy? McCaffrey, Kittle, Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel could take any screen pass to the house.Purdy entered the season with a 10-11 career record when any of his old \"big five\" did not play (that's McCaffrey, Aiyuk, Samuel, Kittle and Trent Williams). Obviously, the band broke up, yet Purdy has still answered a lot of questions this year by winning seven of his eight starts.\nOnly 37% of his passes have gone to his old bandmates this year (McCaffrey, Kittle, Aiyuk and Samuel), compared with 78% in 2023.Purdy's percentage of attempts to McCaffrey, Kittle, Aiyuk or Samuel202274%202378%202449%202537%Sunday night was one of the biggest statements of Purdy's career. He put the team on his back and delivered a five-touchdown performance without perhaps the best left tackle (Williams), tight end (Kittle), pass rusher (Bosa) and linebacker (Warner) in the league. Jauan Jennings, Ricky Pearsall and Jake Tonges have proved to be solid options in the 49ers' revamped arsenal, but they are still not in the same tier as Purdy's old castmates.\nPurdy can elevate in the clutch without the perfect game scriptNot too long ago, the 49ers were looked at as a team that couldn't play from behind, for obvious reasons. Shanahan's quarterbacks have looked like MVPs playing with the right game script. San Francisco's run game would dominate with Shanahan's zone-blocking scheme, and his quarterbacks would thrive with play-action, misdirection, quick passes and screens. When they had to play from behind late in games and air it out, things got wonky.Prior to their comeback in the 2023 playoffs against the Packers, the 49ers had been 0-31 under Shanahan when trailing by at least five points entering the fourth quarter. Then Purdy led them to a big comeback there and a 17-point comeback in the NFC championship game against the Lions. Those were among the crowning achievements of Purdy's career, but they started to feel more like a fluke after 2024.Purdy entered this season with nine touchdown passes and 15 interceptions in his career when tied or trailing in the second half. The 49ers converted on only 3 of 15 game-tying or go-ahead drive chances in the fourth quarter or overtime last season with Purdy under center. He consistently fell short in the clutch with his supporting cast crumbling around him.So far this year, he's converted on 3 of 6 drives in those late, close situations, including delivering this game-winner to Jennings on Sunday night.\nPurdy is not a 'YAC merchant'I'll admit I'd never heard the term \"YAC merchant\" before critics used it to detract from Purdy's MVP case in 2023. He's come a long way from \"it's easy to play quarterback when every screen pass gets taken to the house.\"Purdy is averaging 4.5 yards after catch per completion this year, the third-lowest rate in the NFL. He had the highest average just two years ago (6.6).Purdy's career yards after catch per completionNFL Rank20226.2Third-most20236.6Most20245.514th20254.5Third-fewestPurdy is one of the reasons the 49ers are thriving without such an explosive offense. He is turning in a historic season in terms of moving the chains, and he's doing it without YAC. He leads the NFL in the percentage of attempts going for first downs on all throws (48%), third- and fourth-down passes (63%) and third-and-long throws (54%). Those are all the highest rates by any quarterback in a season in the past 35 years.Nobody comes close in terms of his effectiveness on critical downs without the help of YAC. He is by far the most efficient quarterback in the NFL on third and fourth down this year (0.77 EPA per play) despite averaging an NFL-low 2.7 YAC per completion on those plays. That's tied with Drew Brees (2011) for the most efficient quarterback play on those downs this century. \nPurdy is the best chain mover in the NFL and he doesn't need YAC \n                                                                    TruMedia Sports\n                                                            Purdy is a fantasy MVP (and good off schedule)All of it has added up to an explosion over the past three weeks. Purdy has racked up 116.0 fantasy points during that stretch, the most by a quarterback ever in the fantasy playoffs (for those who play in formats counting passing touchdowns as six points). He's totaled 13 touchdowns in that span, and he's been doing it with plays that are the exact opposite of a game manager.He's extending plays with ease despite battling turf toe earlier this year. He leads the NFL in touchdowns (seven) and passer rating (140.8) with at least three seconds to throw during this three-week stretch.Brock Purdy with 3+ seconds to throwFirst 5 gamesPast 3 gamesCompletion percentage49%73%Yards per attempt5.49.2TD-INT1-67-0Passer rating36.8140.8It wasn't long ago that people were wondering if Mac Jones was going to \"Wally Pipp\" Purdy. Well, Purdy has reminded us why Shanahan dispelled that possibility. His mobility is the biggest thing that separates him from Garoppolo and Jones, who tasted success with Shanahan.\nPurdy's athleticism in and out of the pocket is underrated and Joe Burrow-esque. Only 7.7% of the pressures against Purdy have resulted in sacks this season, the best rate by any quarterback in the NFL.Cris Collinsworth's reaction to Purdy's touchdown on the NBC Sunday Night Football broadcast was sensational: \"I mean, if this were Patrick Mahomes, we'd be screaming, 'Oh, Patrick Mahomes!' ... But that's the way it works, because he has made those kinds of plays all night long and just been carrying the 49ers.\"\nPurdy has swagThe cherry on top of Purdy's recent success is his confidence. I don't remember him being a quarterback who lacked confidence, but I don't ever remember him showing this kind of swag. He's now breaking out the Dougie on touchdown celebrations. What's better than that, you ask? Stats that show his performance before and after breaking out the dance.\nPurdy debuted the Dougie for the first time after a touchdown run against the Browns last month. He has 15 touchdowns, three turnovers and a 129.5 passer rating since that play, compared with eight touchdowns, eight turnovers and an 87.0 rating earlier this year.George Kittle was among the 49ers who enjoyed the celebration when Purdy first used it. \"I just -- he's really good at it,\" Kittle said. \"And I was more just surprised. God forbid a white guy has a little bit of motion.\"\nPurdy has helped reopen the 49ers' Super Bowl windowThe vibes around the team after Purdy's Dougie are palpable. The energy is electric, and dare I say this could be a \"team of destiny.\"Going into the year, it was going to take a miracle for the 49ers to contend for a Super Bowl. A lot of people said the 49ers' Super Bowl window was closed this past offseason -- even Puka Nacua.Thanks to Shanahan, McCaffrey and Purdy, the Super Bowl window is cracked open. There's no Mahomes on the other side of the bracket, the NFC is wide open, and the 49ers will clinch the top seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs with a win Saturday. If they win out through Super Bowl LX (which is at their home stadium), they will not have to play another game away from Levi's Stadium this season.That's pretty much the 49ers' only formula for winning the Super Bowl, but the stars could be aligning. They need the energy from the crowd, and Purdy needs to keep playing like a superstar because the 49ers' offense has no margin for error. They have no pass rush after Bosa and their 2025 first-round pick, Mykel Williams, suffered season-ending injuries. They are last in the NFL in sacks (18.0), and no team has ever finished last in sacks and even reached a conference title game.They are 26th in defensive efficiency this season (-3.77 EPA per game). The 2006 Colts are the only team since 2000 to finish with a mark that low and win the Super Bowl. They got defensive stud Bob Sanders back from injury for that playoff run. The 49ers are going to need Warner back for the NFC title game.It's not going to be easy, but if Purdy keeps playing like this, it's possible.\n            ",

Without Stowers, QB Diego Pavia loses his primary safety valve, forcing him into difficult 3rd-and-long situations against Iowa’s top-10 secondary. Iowa is nearly at full strength. While Vanderbilt’s path to 10 wins depended on volatile, high-risk plays, Iowa’s four defeats came by a mere 15 points combined—with no single loss exceeding 5 points—demonstrating the Hawkeyes are stronger than their 8-4 record suggests. In a low-scoring, physical game, getting 5.5 points with the better defense is simply too much value to pass up. The Hawkeyes went 7-0 ATS vs winning teams this season.

Duke QB Darian Mensah explored a jump into the NFL draft before deciding to return to Durham for another season. Arizona State WR Jordyn Tyson, perhaps the top pro prospect at his position, elected to close out his college career. The Blue Devils enter with momentum, having ambushed Virginia in the ACC title game for their third straight win outright. The Sun Devils managed just seven points in their latest test, a smashing from rival Arizona. ASU already was down a standout with a late-season injury to QB Sam Leavitt, who intends to transfer. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Larry Hartstein\n            \n            \n                                    \n        \n            +500\n        \n        \n            (100%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            5-0 in Last 5 VATECH ATS Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAB\n                                                UVA @ VATECH • Wed 2:00pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                VATECH +5.5\n                            \n                            \n                                -110\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Spread\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 30 @ 11:47pm\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            Virginia Tech 6-9 freshman Neoklis Avdalas (14.6 ppg, 5.0 apg) is set to return from an illness after missing the team's last game, while senior forward Tobi Lawal (12.8 ppg, 10.3 rpg) and center Antonio Dorn are questionable. Another starter, Tyler Johnson, is out. But getting the distributor Avdalas back is huge as the Hokies prepare for this rivalry game. UVA won't have senior guard Jacari White (10.9 ppg), a 50 percent 3-point shooter. Even short-handed, I like the Hokies to keep it close behind Amani Hansberry (16.3 ppg, 8.4 rpg).\n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Matt Severance\n            \n            \n                                    \n                    \n                                        \n        #1\n    \n                                    \n        \n            +1205\n        \n        \n            (61%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            65-41-1 in Last 107 NCAAF Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAF\n                                                MICH @ TEXAS • Wed 3:00pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                TEXAS -6.5\n                            \n                            \n                                -115\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Spread\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 11 @ 1:18pm\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            Curious what the books would do with this game with the utterly stunning Sherrone Moore news (spread rose 2), although there had been some rumors something was going on behind the scenes in Ann Arbor. But wow. I would think a mass player exodus is coming for U-M and that's the only reason I will play this game now. I will honestly be surprised if star freshman QB Bryce Underwood plays on New Year's Eve, for an example. Lot of chatter he's on the way to LSU. There is no chatter that Arch Manning won't play for Texas. Otherwise, don't expect to see bowl picks from me until hours before the game unless I get concrete evidence of a QB out or the like. \n                                    \n            \n    \n\n                    \n                                                                \n\n    \n            \n            \n            \n                Bruce Marshall\n            \n            \n                                    \n        \n            +517\n        \n        \n            (55%)\n        \n    \n                \n                                            53-43-4 in Last 100 NCAAF Picks\n                                    \n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                                        \n                    \n                                                    NCAAF\n                                                MICH @ TEXAS • Wed 3:00pm\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                    \n    \n                                                \n                    \n                                            \n                    \n                        \n                            \n                                MICH +7.5\n                            \n                            \n                                -118\n                            \n                        \n                                                    \n                                Spread\n                            \n                                            \n                \n            \n                            \n                    Picked: Dec 31 @ 3:06am\n                \n                    \n                \n                    Analysis\n                \n                \n                                            The Wolverines are used to distractions, as now-dismissed HC Sherrone Moore was already suspended for a couple of game earlier this season, and of course Jim Harbaugh missed several games due to suspension a few years ago. Former Charlotte HC and longtime Ann Arbor aide Biff Poggi, who stepped in for Moore earlier this season and won both games, reassumes command for the Citrus Bowl. The personnel is much different from early last season when Texas rolled 31-12, and there are opt-outs to consider, but this spread looks too high, as we suspect Arch Manning will have issues.  If Bryce Underwood can make a few plays vs. a Texas D that just dismissed coordinator Pete Kwiatokwski, Michigan has a chance.

The Pistons lead the NBA in blocks and rank third in steals, which will make a Lakers team missing two starters in Reaves and Hachimura -- who combine for nearly 40 ppg -- struggle to put points on the scoreboard. Add in that both teams rank among the bottom 10 in both 3-point percentage and made 3-pointers per game, and there should be lots of rebounds to grab on both ends.

USC quarterback Jayden Maiava is playing, but he won't have his top three targets as receivers Ja'Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon and tight end Lake McRee have all opted out. TCU's most notable absence is quarterback Josh Hoover, who is heading to the transfer portal.Kickoff from the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas is at 9 p.m. ET.

The total has dropped since opening at 58.5, with absences such as Hoover and Lemon factoring into that. USC, however, should still be able to move that ball with Maiava leading the charge. Freshman receiver Tanook Hines should be able to step up and be a top target, while USC's run game remains in good shape with King Miller leading that way. The Horned Frogs have a capable backup quarterback in Ken Seals who can step in.

    "body": "\n        A light four-game slate makes up Tuesday's NBA schedule, so you can narrow your focus with an NBA parlay. The four contests are 76ers vs. Grizzlies (-1), Celtics vs. Jazz (+8.5), Lakers vs. Pistons (-2.5) and Clippers vs. Kings (+9.5). Many may focus on the games with the two Los Angeles teams when searching for NBA best bets for their basketball parlay. No team has a longer active winning streak than the Clippers, who have won four in a row. Meanwhile, the Lakers were swept in the season series by Detroit last year, which ended a seven-game win streak by the Lakers in their matchups.While you could make money line, spread or over/under picks on any of these contests, you can also make predictions on NBA props, whether they be for a team, a player or a game.

These teams have inverse records, with Boston at 19-12 and Utah at 12-19. However, the Celtics have been playing better than their record indicates recently as one of the hottest NBA teams. Following a middling 5-7 start, Boston is 14-5 over its last 19 games, going 13-6 against the spread over this stretch.Jaylen Brown has performed like an All-NBA player as of late as he's riding a nine-game streak of 30-plus points, which is tied with Larry Bird for the longest in the illustrious history of the Celtics franchise. With Utah missing Walker Kessler (shoulder), and the Jazz allowing more points per game than any other team, Brown has a great chance of pushing his streak to 10 games.

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule features an SEC vs. Big Ten matchup in the Liberty Mutual Music City Bowl 2025. Tuesday's contest has the Tennessee Volunteers facing the Illinois Fighting Illini, with both teams at 8-4. The Vols are coming off a 45-24 defeat to Vanderbilt in its last outing, while the Illini knocked off Northwestern, 20-13, when they last took the field. The 2025 Music City Bowl will be the first-ever meeting between the programs. Tennessee's opt-out list includes receiver Chris Brazzell II, linebacker Arion Carter, cornerback Colton Hood and edge Joshua Josephs. Offensive lineman J.C. Davis and Linebacker Gabe Jacas have opted out for Illinois. Kickoff is at 5:30 p.m. ET from Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn. The Volunteers are 3-point favorites in the latest Illinois vs. Tennessee odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for total points is 62.5.

Now, though, that commitment will, according to the Athletic, \"be deferred in the range of three-to-five years,\" with an unknown payout structure. The arrangement with Rendon will theoretically allow the Angels to be more active on the free-agent market or in assuming salary commitments via trade. The Angels initially signed Rendon prior to the 2020 season to a seven-year, $245 million free-agent contract coming off a strong tenure with the Nationals. While Rendon was highly productive during the abbreviated 2020 campaign, injuries and broad-based decline took firm hold thereafter. Through the first six years of Rendon's Angels tenure he put up a total WAR of just 3.9 at a cost of more than $200 million. Prior to joining the Angels, Rendon amassed a WAR of 34.2 in parts of seven seasons with Washington. As well, Rendon didn't play at all in 2025 after undergoing a second hip surgery in the spring, and he also appeared unlikely to play in 2026. Since 2021, Rendon has averaged just 41 games played per season. \nFrom the team standpoint, Rendon's Angels contract stands as one of the worst in MLB history. He's expected to retire once the buyout is complete, ESPN previously reported.As for the Angels, they presently have Christian Moore penciled in as their third baseman, but they may now pursue an upgrade at Rendon's former position. Available free agents include Eugenio Suárez and Alex Bregman, although the latter appears more likely to go to team better positioned to contend in 2026. On the trade market, the Cardinals are trying to find a home for Nolan Arenado, who's a native of Newport Beach. \nThe Angels are coming off a 72-90 season in 2025, and overall they've endured 10 straight losing seasons. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Teams coming off byes but going in opposite directions will meet in the 'Sunday Night Football' NFL Week 13 matchup as the Denver Broncos visit the Washington Commanders. Denver (9-2) has won eight in a row and defeated Kansas City, 22-19, in its last game. Meanwhile, Washington has lost six in a row, most recently falling to Miami, 16-13, in the first-ever NFL Madrid Game on Nov. 16. Jayden Daniels (elbow), who has been out since Week 9, has been ruled out. Kickoff is at 8:20 p.m. ET from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md. The teams have alternated wins and losses over their last eight matchups, with Washington prevailing in the last meeting in 2023. The latest Commanders vs. Broncos odds have Denver as 5.5-point road favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 43.5 via SportsLine consensus. Before making any Broncos vs. Commanders picks, check out the NFL predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 13 on a 49-33 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, the model has set its sights on Commanders vs. Broncos.

That contrasts with Washington which has not only lost six in a row straight up, but the Commanders have also lost versus the spread in all six of those. The Broncos possess an elite defense, leading the NFL in sacks, having allowed the fewest passing touchdowns, and holding opponents to a league-low in yards per rush. The defense gets another boost with cornerback Pat Surtain II (pectoral) cleared to play. At the other end of the spectrum is Washington's defense, which has bottom-five rankings in points allowed, yards allowed and turnovers forced. Washington has allowed an average of 34 points over its last five games, while the Broncos haven't given up 34 points in any game this season. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Commanders can coverWashington HC Dan Quinn took over defensive play-calling duties prior to the team's last game, and the results were instant as the Commanders gave up just 16 points and a season-low of 142 passing yards. That's a promising sign heading into SNF, especially facing a Broncos offense that does not travel. The Broncos are averaging just 18 points over their last four road games, and they've failed to rush for more than 100 yards in three straight games overall. While Daniels' return is in doubt, receiver Terry McLaurin (quad) has been cleared to return after being out since Week 8. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Broncos vs. Commanders picksSportsLine's model has simulated Commanders vs. Broncos 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 45 combined points. It also says one side of the spread hits in over 50% of simulations.

    "body": "\n        Ten more games are set for the Week 13 NFL DFS 'main slate' on Sunday, consisting of all the games that kick in the afternoon windows. The highest total on the board is Bills vs. Steelers at 45.5, making players like Josh Allen, James Cook and DK Metcalf potential targets for NFL lineups. With injuries impacting many rosters and the weather turning colder, however, offense could be tougher to find as the regular season winds down.Which players should you target for your NFL DFS picks, and who are the daily Fantasy football sleepers that can differentiate your roster in tournaments on daily Fantasy sites like FanDuel or DraftKings? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Week 13 Sunday, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to the Sunday NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Week 13One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks is Seattle running back Kenneth Walker III at $5,300 on DraftKings and $6,900 on FanDuel. Walker was limited in practice earlier in the week, but got back to full participation and does not carry an injury designation. He's provided a high floor for DFS players this season, taking at least 10 carries in every game. He's cleared 65 rushing yards in all but four games this season as well. As a bonus, he's been more active in the passing game the past two weeks, combining for six catches and 74 yards in that span. He has a great matchup against the Vikings, a team with a poor run defense. Seattle's status as an 11.5-point favorite could play in his favor as well in terms of game flow. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Chargers tight end Oronde Gadsden II at $4,300 on DraftKings and $5,900 on FanDuel. The rookie out of Syracuse has been a breakout star this year with a 37-507-2 receiving line that few saw coming. Big plays are his speciality as he ranks third among tight ends in average yards per catch at 13.7. McClure has him rated as one of his top tight ends this week against the Raiders, but Gadsden is just the fifth-most expensive tight end on both FanDuel and DraftKings, making him a steal in Week 13.

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 13 features a a number of key divisional matchups. In an important AFC South battle, the Houston Texans look to pull within one game of the division lead when they meet the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts are favored by 3.5 points as both C.J. Stroud and Daniel Jones have been battling injury concerns. Both, however, carry no injury designation heading into the game.A non-divisional matchup with heavy AFC playoff race implications will be played on Sunday afternoon when Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills (-3) take on Aaron Rodgers, who missed last week's game, and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Buffalo has won four of the past five meetings, with the Bills pulling out a 31-17 win in the last meeting on Jan. 15, 2024. Sunday's largest spreads are Vikings vs. Seahawks (-11.5), Rams (-10.5) vs. Panthers and Raiders vs. Chargers (-9.5).Before making any Week 13 NFL picks or NFL score predictions on those games or others, you need to see the NFL against the spread, over/under and money line predictions powered by the self-learning SportsLine AI.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Built using cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques by SportsLine's Data Science team, AI Predictions and AI Ratings are generated for each game.

    "body": "\n        The Week 13 NFL schedule has already seen four upsets over the course of Thanksgiving and Black Friday. There's plenty more to come over the weekend, however. The other standalone games to make Week 13 NFL picks on are both Super Bowl rematches. Broncos vs. Commanders saw Washington prevail in The Big Game back in 1988, and the Week 13 NFL odds have Denver as 5.5-point road favorites on Sunday night, with Jayden Daniels (elbow) ruled out. Then on Monday, Giants vs. Patriots (-7.5) is a matchup we've seen twice in the Super Bowl, with New York winning each time.Sunday afternoon's slate features a couple of matchups where time and travel could be factors with your Week 13 NFL picks. Cardinals vs. Buccaneers (-4.5) and Rams vs. Panthers (+10.5) both see the NFC West teams flying to the East Coast for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs. Historically, this is known to favor the home teams, thus making the Bucs and Panthers, perhaps, a bit more appealing than the NFL spreads suggest. All of the updated Week 13 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 13 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Kirk Cousins had two passing touchdowns in Sunday's win over New Orleans, and having two passing scores, plus getting a win, is something that Michael Penix Jr. did once across his 12 NFL starts. Meanwhile, the Jets also had a QB change, but Tyrod Taylor dropped to 0-2 this season in a Week 12 loss to Baltimore. Taylor has nearly as many turnovers (three) across his pair of starts as Justin Fields had (four) across nine starts, so it's hard to call the change an upgrade. The Falcons are undefeated ATS over their last three outside of Atlanta, while the Jets are just 1-3 ATS over their last four at MetLife Stadium. The model has Atlanta prevailing versus the spread well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 13 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-6, 41.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations. The Jags have won five of their last six versus the Titans, as Tennessee is now 1-16 over its last 17 games overall. Cam Ward hasn't thrown more than one touchdown in any game as a pro, and only J.J. McCarthy has a lower passer rating this season. Ward won't find much help in the ground game on Sunday as Jacksonville has the No. 1 run defense, while the Jags also control the trenches on offense as they rank eighth in rushing yards. The Jaguars are projected to have over 120 rushing yards, while the Titans have under 80 and average less than 3.8 yards per carry. The model has the Jags covering and says the Over hits in almost 60% of sims. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 13 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 13 NFL schedule and just revealed four teams projected to outright win in at least 70% of simulations, potentially giving you a huge payday by betting the money line. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 13 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which four teams should you lock in now?

Ohio State is -10.5 against Michigan as the Buckeyes look for their first win in this rivalry since 2019. Other Rivalry Week college football lines of note include No. 19 Tennessee (-3) vs. No. 14 Vanderbilt, No. 18 Virginia (-8.5) vs. Virginia Tech and No. 17 USC (-21.5) vs. UCLA.

However, last week the Razorbacks got blown out by Texas and interim head coach Bobby Petrino questioned their effort. That's a big deal for me. These kids were battling all season but after so many close losses, I wonder if they are more concerned about the transfer portal than playing Missouri. Another factor here is Missouri and Arkansas are rivals. That may not mean a lot for most of the country but the boosters who pay all that NIL money like to beat their rivals. I expect Eli Drinkwitz to have his kids ready to play on Saturday even after a tough loss at Oklahoma. Missouri's offense can sputter at times but it should have little trouble against an Arkansas defense that allows 185 rushing yards and 37 points per game. The Razorbacks are finishing up a tough season and I think Missouri will be the more motivated team here.

Not only can you make picks on those conference matchups, but a number of non-conference contests could factor into your college football betting strategy. South Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite over Clemson, per the latest Week 14 college football odds, in an SEC vs. ACC battle.Others of that ilk include Florida vs. Florida State (+1.5) and Kentucky vs. Louisville (-1.5). Meanwhile, no team has performed better in college football picks against the spread than Texas Tech, which is 10-1 versus the line. The Red Raiders are 23.5-point favorites over West Virginia as the former seeks a win to secure its first-ever trip to the Big 12 Championship Game.

The Gators have been much more competitive since firing Billy Napier as the team has as many ATS wins (two) in four games under interim Billy Gonzales as it had in seven games under Napier. Florida won last year's matchup -- by 20 points on the road -- and it hosting this year's contest gives it a massive advantage. The Seminoles have not won or covered in an away stadium since 2023 as they are 0-8 both straight-up and against the spread over that run. In addition to Florida covering, the model forecasts the Under to hit in over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Virginia Tech (+8.5, 52.5) covers on the road versus No. 17 Virginia at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. It's impossible to ignore the outright dominance of the Hokies over their in-state rival in this series, as Virginia Tech has won 19 of its last 20 games versus Virginia Tech. The last few matchups haven't even been close, as Virginia Tech won by 20 points at home last year and prevailed by 38 points the last time UVA hosted in 2023. This year, the Hokies have played much better under interim coach, Philip Montgomery, as they've both outright won and covered three times under him, compared to being winless both straight up and ATS under former coach Brent Fry. UVA has dropped two straight at home ATS as the model forecasts this as a one-score game. The model projects the Hokies to cover well over 50% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 14The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 14, and it's identified several A-rated picks involving major games. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you jump on?

Alabama and Auburn meet for the 90th time, and although the two teams have inverse SEC records as one another, with the Crimson Tide at 6-1 and the Tigers 1-6 in SEC play, this still figures to be one of the best games of the Saturday Week 14 college football schedule.

Notre Dame has the offensive firepower to go Over this number by themselves, but Stanford has a capable offense, averaging 18.7 ppg this season, including scoring 31 points last week against Cal.

    "body": "\nThere are a lot of things that make college football so great, and rivalries are certainly at or near the top of the list. If you love seeing teams with bad blood going up against one another, Saturday is a good day for you as Rivalry Week is in full swing. Week 14, the final week of the college football regular season, sees archrivals square off in games with massive implications. In some cases, we've got trophies and bragging rights on the line. In others, there's the potential for making or missing the College Football Playoff depending on the game's result. And then there's The Game between Ohio State and Michigan. These two foes have no shortage of bad blood, with the Wolverines winning this matchup each of the last four years, with last year's win in Columbus setting off a massive postgame skirmish after a Michigan player planted a team flag at midfield. That will all surely be front of mind for both sides when the 11-0 Buckeyes visit the 9-2 Wolverines, the latter of whom could punch a CFP ticket with another win in this rivalry.The rivalry action hardly stops there, with 9-2 Vanderbilt facing 8-3 Tennessee, 8-3 Washington hosting 10-1 Oregon, and, of course, the annual Iron Bowl between 9-2 Alabama and 5-6 Auburn. All three of these games are among the more heated rivalries in the nation, and all three could drastically shake up the CFP field ahead of the final selection process. In addition to Rivalry Week in college football, Saturday has no shortage of other action across the NBA, NHL and college basketball. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on at the top sportsbooks on Saturday, Nov. 29. All times Eastern. CFB best bets today, where to watchNo. 1 Ohio State at No. 15 MichiganTime: 12 p.m. | Location: Ann Arbor | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Michigan ML +311 Expert: Michigan +10.5 (Matt Severance)\nThe Buckeyes are in good shape when it comes to making the CFP, but they surely will look to get the monkey off their back as it pertains to this rivalry. Michigan has beaten Ohio State four years in a row, taking back a rivalry that was pretty one-sided since the turn of the century. Even amid a down year last season, Michigan was able to upset the Buckeyes in Columbus. While the result was stunning enough, what occurred postgame was talked about just as much, if not more, as a Wolverines player planted a team flag at midfield on the OSU logo, setting off a skirmish that resulted in police presence and pepper spray. While that all didn't impact the Buckeyes' CFP run as they won it all, OSU needs to get over its Michigan problem. The Buckeyes have hardly had to sweat this year, but it's worth monitoring the statuses of star receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate, who both missed last week. Additionally, the Wolverines are 5-0 at home this year. The SportsLine Projection Model sees value backing the underdog Wolverines on the money line as they win in 33% of simulations, and SportsLine expert Matt Severance thinks Michigan will, at the very least, cover at +10.5.\nNo. 10 Alabama at AuburnTime: 7:30 p.m. | Location: Auburn, Ala. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Alabama -5.5\nThe Crimson Tide rolled to eight wins in a row after falling to Florida State in Week 1, and it looked like Alabama was going to have no problem making the CFP after missing out last season. Well, the Tide surprisingly lost to Oklahoma a few weeks ago, giving them their second loss of the year. A loss to in-state rival Auburn would put the Tide at 9-3, and that may keep them out of the playoff for the second year in a row. Auburn has had a strange year, as the Tigers enter Week 14 at 5-6 and having fired head coach Hugh Freeze. This Auburn team is excellent at keeping things close and uncomfortable, as five of its six losses this year were by one score, and the other was by 10 to Georgia. The Tigers will obviously be playing for pride and for the ability to potentially knock their rival out of the CFP, but a win over Bama would also get Auburn to 6-6 and make the team bowl eligible. The SportsLine model, however, sees Alabama taking care of its rival, as the Tide win in the vast majority of simulations and also cover the 5.5-point spread 55% of the time. More CFB best bets:Thomas Casale's power ratingsBruce Marshall's Week 14 spread tips and trendsNBA best bets today, where to watchBoston Celtics at Minnesota TimberwolvesTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Minnesota | TV: NBA TV | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Boston ML +233\nTwo playoff contenders face off to kick off the NBA slate on Saturday with the Celtics visiting the Timberwolves. Boston is 10-8 and has won two in a row and seven of its last 10 games, while Minnesota has dropped three in a row but has still won six of its last 10. These foes met three times last year, and the Celtics won all three contests. The Celtics this year are dealing with life without star forward Jayson Tatum, who is rehabbing from a torn Achilles. In his absence, Jaylen Brown has been the go-to guy, averaging 28.2 points per game. Anthony Edwards once again leads the way for the Timberwolves, averaging 28 points per game. Minnesota is favored at home, but the SportsLine model prefers backing the Celtics on the money line as they win in 43% of simulations, returning value at +233. Looking ahead: Bills at SteelersTime: 4:25 p.m., Sunday | Location: Kansas City | TV: CBS and Paramount+  | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Steelers ML +150 | Expert: Pittsburgh +4 (R.J. White)\nOne of the top games of the Sunday NFL slate is a battle of two playoff contenders as the Bills visit the Steelers in what very well could be a playoff preview of sorts. Both teams are looking to get back on track after some recent struggles, with Buffalo having dropped two of its last three, including last week to Houston, while Pittsburgh has also dropped two of three. While the Bills are trying to get catch up with the Patriots, who have won nine in a row entering the weekend, the Steelers enter Week 13 with a slim lead in the AFC North race at 6-5 thanks to the Bengals beating the Ravens on Thursday. What makes this matchup extra interesting is the Steelers should have Aaron Rodgers back this week after he missed last week's loss to Chicago due to a left wrist injury. The Bills are favored here even with the game in Pittsburgh, but the SportsLine model sees more value backing Pittsburgh as plus money underdogs on the money line. SportsLine's R.J. White is also backing the Steelers, but against the spread, noting a potential mismatch in Pittsburgh's favor against a weakened Buffalo offensive line. \"The Bills struggled offensively last Thursday when facing an elite defensive front, and while the Steelers aren't on that same level anymore, they certainly still have defenders who can get after the passer,\" White said. \"The Bills have major injury concerns on the O-line with both tackles missing practice to begin the week, including Dion Dawkins being in concussion protocol, and they might be held under 20 points for the third time in four weeks.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter, Juventus and AC Milan will compete with the team coached by Antonio Conte to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as AS Roma, Atalanta, Lazio, Fiorentina, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments.This weekend's Serie A slate features some huge battles, highlighted by AS Roma facing Napoli on Sunday: Here's what to know: Gasperini's strong start of the season AS Roma started off the 2025-26 season really well under the new coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, who joined the Giallorossi in the summer 2025 after a decade spent at Atalanta, where he achieved some incredible results including the 2023-24 UEFA Europa League win in the 3-0 final against Bayer Leverkusen. Despite his strong background, there were some concerns about his impact at the club, considering the issues AS Roma faced in the recent years. However, Gasperini was immediately able to restore the right mentality and won nine of the 12 Serie A games played so far, and lost three. It's difficult to predict if Roma will be among the title contenders until the end of the season, but considering this is only his first season at the club, there are plenty of positives to take ahead of the future. After the 2-1 victory over Midtjylland on Thursday in the UEFA Europa League, Gasperini spoke to Sky Italy ahead of the big game on Sunday, as they currently have a two-point margin on both AC Milan and Napoli. \"We didn't play a great game. We took an early lead and I thought we could have done better technically. It's also true that we play a lot, we moved the ball slowly and made a lot of mistakes. We need to do much better for Sunday against Napoli. Paulo Dybala is back. He's recovered, he has no problems, he could have continued until the last minute.\" Dybala is expected to start against Napoli at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday. How to watch AS Roma vs. Napoli, oddsDate: Sunday, Nov. 30 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Olimpico -- Rome Live stream: Paramount+Odds: AS Roma +156; Draw +186; Napoli +208How to watch Serie A Matchday 13All times U.S./Eastern\nFriday, November 28Como 2, Sassuolo 0Saturday, November 29Parma vs. Udinese, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Genoa vs. Hellas Verona, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Juventus vs. Cagliari, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AC Milan vs. Lazio, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, November 30Lecce vs. Torino, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Pisa vs. Inter, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Atalanta vs. Fiorentina, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Napoli, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, December 1Bologna vs. Cremonese, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of WWE's signature events is back with some of the biggest stars imaginable. WWE Survivor Series goes down on Saturday night in San Diego with the imaginative format taking center stage once again in WarGames. There will be two WarGames matches taking place at Petco Park -- the fourth straight year the stipulation has been used -- in the men's and women's divisions, and will have names like Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, Cody Rhodes, CM Punk, AJ Lee, Rhea Ripley and Charlotte Flair in action.The teams could provide some interesting drama, both internally and externally. Reigns, Rhodes and Punk have their own storyline developing as Reigns has his eyes on getting back in the world title scene while being joined by his cousins, The Usos, to form the five-man team. Meanwhile, Paul Heyman has assembled a powerhouse unit, headlined by Lesnar, who is joined by Drew McIntyre, Logan Paul, Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed.On the women's side, Lee, Ripley, Flair, Alexa Bliss and Iyo Sky will have their hands full with Nia Jax Lash Legend Asuka, Kairi Sane and Lynch.\nSurvivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion wrestles his last pay-per-view match, granting Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins. On the last Raw before Survivor Series, McIntyre and Paul won a match, earning their team the advantage.\nRhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch. On the final SmackDown before Survivor Series, Flair defeated Asuka to win her team the advantage.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.Women's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs (3-1) got a 139-136 road win over the Denver Nuggets to take Group C.

    "body": "\n        It's the end of November in the NBA, and lately, that has meant one thing: the culmination of group play for the NBA Cup. The format was once again altered this season, with the group stage of the tournament held until the end of November. The week of Thanksgiving was instead stacked with three days of NBA Cup action to give fans with a bit more time on their hands some marquee basketball to watch.Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday all featured group stage games for the Cup, and Friday's slate concluded that round of the tournament. We now know the eight teams that will advance to the knockout stage: the Knicks, Magic, Raptors and Heat in the East, and the Thunder, Lakers, Spurs and Suns in the West.Quarterfinal games will still be played in home venues, which is good news for the Lakers, Thunder, Magic and Raptors, who will be hosting. After that, the final four shifts to Las Vegas for the semifinal and championship game. Those games are still to come, but for now, let's look at some of the big-picture winners and losers of the now-completed group stage.\n        \n            \n                2025 NBA Cup bracket: Knicks, Magic, Thunder, Spurs win group stages to advance to knockout rounds\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner: Orlando MagicIt's no secret that the beginning of the season was shaky for the Magic. The last thing anyone wants after trading four first-round picks for a player who has never made an All-Star Game in Desmond Bane is a 4-6 start that raises questions about the team's fit. The turning point came in Game No. 11, in which Bane hit a game-winning 3-pointer that sparked the turnaround. The Magic are 8-2 in their last 10, with Friday's win over the Eastern Conference-leading Detroit Pistons clinching their group and sending them to the knockout stage.\nA win like that can be validating. Yes, the first couple of weeks were tough for the Magic, but they've seemingly put those struggles behind them. They've had both a top-10 offense and defense in this 10-game stretch, a rarity for a Magic team that has spent 13 years in the bottom 10 offensively. Just getting to Vegas would be proof of concept for Orlando, a chance to show that this is a team built for big games. There aren't many of those this early in the season, but the Magic took their first on Friday, and now they have at least one more ahead of them.Loser: Milwaukee BucksA seventh straight loss for the Bucks is obviously the bigger story. The feel-good vibes of their 8-5 start have seemingly passed, and a team that's desperate to win to appease Giannis Antetokounmpo ahead of his extension-eligibility is probably going to start feeling the heat soon.But that's not the only disappointment. The defending NBA Cup champion Bucks have now been eliminated from their repeat bid. Meanwhile, the 2023 champion Lakers stormed through their group with a 4-0 record. Now, the Lakers still have a long way to go as they seek a second Cup championship, but if they manage to win their next three tournament games, they'll have claimed two of the first three NBA Cups. If that happens, Milwaukee's 2024 trophy probably gets forgotten and the early stages of Cup history, much like overall NBA history, get written by the Lakers. \nWinners: Toronto Raptors and Phoenix SunsEvery NBA Cup features a breakout from a surprise team. The inaugural event was the world's introduction to Tyrese Haliburton as the Indiana Pacers went on a Cinderella run to Las Vegas that would eventually prove to be the beginning of something much bigger. A year later, it was the Houston Rockets bullying their way to Vegas and ultimately losing a semifinal rock fight to the Thunder before ultimately emerging as a Western Conference contender later in the year.We have two candidates this year: the Raptors and Suns. Toronto is 14-5 so far this season and won their group with an undefeated 4-0 record. The Suns pushed the Thunder to the brink on Friday and otherwise swept the rest of their group as they've emerged as as a far more balanced team than last year's star-driven disaster. Both have drastically exceeded expectations, but both come with real questions.The Raptors have tied for the NBA's sixth-easiest schedule thus far this year, and that doesn't include opponents' injuries that they've benefitted from. They've beaten Cleveland three times, for instance, but Darius Garland played in none of those games and Jarrett Allen played in one. The Suns have faced an even easier slate. In fact, only the Thunder had played worse opponents as of Friday. Both of these teams need some marquee wins against true contenders to earn real respect across the league. Well, the NBA Cup is a chance to do that. Make it to Vegas and suddenly you're playing top teams on the biggest regular-season stage available. So let's see it. If either of these teams is for real, let's see them get to Vegas like the Rockets and Pacers did.\nLoser: Houston RocketsThe Rockets have lost four games all year. Half of them have been in the NBA Cup. One was a road loss to Victor Wembanyama's Spurs. The other was a three-point loss to Nikola Jokić and the Denver Nuggets. That's all it took to knock Houston out. Tournaments like these always have a group of death. This year, it was West Group C, which also featured the plucky Portland Trail Blazers and the grizzled Golden State Warriors. There wasn't an easy win to be found in that group. Someone good was going to miss out -- it turned out to be Houston. Fortunately, the Rockets at least got their Vegas trip last winter. At this point, they're focused on a different trophy.Winner: Los Angeles LakersWe've already covered the concept of a possible Laker dynasty in the NBA Cup, but there's something a bit more meaningful to watch here. The Lakers haven't lost since LeBron James returned last week, but they haven't exactly faced a murderer's row of opponents. Two wins over Utah followed by victories over the Clippers and Mavericks feel more like a way to ease James back into the fold than any sort of meaningful statements.The Lakers need a measuring stick. The Spurs without Wembanyama may not qualify (more on them in a moment), but a trip to Vegas that would almost certainly include a date with the 18-1 Thunder certainly would. The last time the Lakers faced the Thunder, they got absolutely walloped. James didn't play in that game. He presumably would in a Vegas showdown. That's the best possible game this bracket can give us, and it's the best chance the Lakers will have to size themselves up against the competition early in the season. \nLoser: The NBALook, the NBA has no official preference when it comes to which teams advance in the tournament or in the playoffs for that matter. But before we even get into market-related conspiracies, we can at least acknowledge a league-wide desire for healthier teams to advance into these marquee games. This is the dilemma San Antonio's advancement has created.If Wembanyama were healthy, everyone would be thrilled to have the Spurs in the quarterfinals. Everyone wants to see him play high-profile games. But Wembanyama is sidelined with a calf strain. There is no telling at this point whether Wembanyama will be available to play when the quarterfinals commence a bit more than a week from now. The Spurs could obviously win without him -- they did against Denver on Friday. But come on, the world wants to see Wemby in Vegas, not the Wembyettes. Had Denver won on Friday, it would be the Nuggets advancing to the quarterfinals and setting up a fascinating Western Conference foursome featuring three title contenders and the upstart Suns. Instead, we're all left hoping that Wembanyama can make it back in time to face the Lakers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are one win away from the first MLS Cup appearance in their history, and at 38, the Argentine shows no signs of slowing down. The Herons will host New York City FC in the Eastern Conference final at Chase Stadium on Saturday as they look to secure a trophy to end their season on a strong note. Adjustments by Javier Mascherano have the team riding a shutout streak of more than 200 minutes, but during these playoffs, one thing has been made clear: Miami will go as far as Messi can take them. This is obviously no surprise. Even at his age, Messi was far and away the best player in MLS this season. He led the league in goals, with 29, five more than anybody else, assists with 19 (tied with Anders Dreyer), and shots with 157. Of those goals, 28 were non-penalty goals an MLS record. He did this all while only playing in only 28 games in a 34 game regular season schedule. Messi may be 38 years old, but he remains Lionel Messi, an unstoppable force the likes of which the world, let alone MLS, has never seen.And then the playoffs started, and things got even better. How to watch Inter Miami vs. New York City FC, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 6 p.m. ETLocation: Chase Stadium -- Fort Lauderdale, FloridaLive stream: MLS Season PassOdds: Inter Miami -210; Draw +360; NYCFC +490With 12 goal contributions during the playoffs, no player has more in MLS history, and Messi's six goals lead all members of the playoffs, and so do his six assists (including secondary assists). He's done this in just four games, but it's unheard of for one player to have been involved in every goal for their club during a playoff run. But that's just what Messi has done during his time in MLS. He has made the unheard of seem regular, and this run is no different.No team has ever won MLS Cup with one player contributing to all of their goals, so if Miami can accomplish that with Messi keeping up what he has been doing, they can make even more history during this postseason. Taylor Twellman, himself an MLS legend, contributed to every goal on the run New England Revolution made the final in 2007, but they fell to the Houston Dynamo in the MLS Cup. Also, that was a grand total of three team goals, Miami is already at 12.\nPlayers to be involved in every goal contributionMinimum four games playedSeasonPlayer TeamGoalsAssistsContributionsTeam Goals Games2025Lionel MessiInter Miami66121242018Daniel RoyerNew York Red Bulls224442007Taylor TwellmanNew England Revolution30334You can already see clear differences in how many goals Messi has been involved in compared to others on this list, and while the league MVP hasn't been announced yet, it'd be a surprise for anyone other than Messi to win the award, as he's arguably having the best season of anyone to ever come through MLS.Messi may not have a trophy to mark what he's done yet, but with Miami becoming the first MLS team to ever defeat a team from a European top-five league when they triumphed over Porto during the Club World Cup, this is a team showing what the possibilities are for MLS, and a large reason for that is Messi's impact so let's take a deeper look at some numbers that have defined the season so far.48: Goal Contributions during the MLS regular seasonWith 29 goals and 19 assists during the season, only one player has had more, and that's Carlos Vela in 2019. Vela had a whopping 49 goal contributions with 34 goals and 15 assists, being involved in more than a goal per game. Those two stand alone, and even with the league including secondary assists in their numbers, this is an astounding figure. It's worth nothing that excluding secondary assists Messi jumps ahead of Vela on the goal contribution front as 16 of Messi's 19 assists were primary assists while only 10 of Vela's 15 were. Then there's the question of penalties. Vela scored a whopping nine goals from the penalty spot, Messi scored one.\nNo one has been able to stop Messi when he's on the pitch, and even when he has to pick his spots to get forward, the Argentine's ability to float into space is unmatched. Having a player like this on the team also opens up opportunities for those around them, which should bring no surprise that Miami's 12 goal contributions during this playoff run are the most of any team.7: Consecutive matches with a goal or an assistTo have so many goal involvements, a player needs to be consistent, and of course, Messi has done just that. You ahve to go back to September 30, facing the Chicago Fire, to find he last time that Messi hasn't been involved in a goal. Since then, he has had 11 goals and 11 assists. Quite some balance, but in the 32 MLS matches that Messi has featured in this season, including the playoffs, he has only failed to register a goal contribution in five matches. Miami has also failed to win any of those matches, losing four and drawing one. So it's simple: if NYCFC stops Messi, they can win the match. Just statistics say that it'll be quite hard to do.0: Trophies this seasonWhile the Messi era has brought Miami a Supporters' Shield and Leagues Cup trophy, this is one number that the Herons are trying to change, and New York City FC will stand in their way of doing that. NYCFC is the only team remaining in the playoffs that have won the MLS Cup before, but that doesn't mean Miami won't have enough experience to get them through the match in front of their home fans. Looking to not only send Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets into retirement on a high note but also close out Chase Stadium with a trophy, all of the pressure will be on the Herons to get the job done. \nThat's part of why the playoffs have had a different intensity for them. Last season's first round exit to Atlanta United is firmly in the past, but this season also isn't a successful one without a trophy. Just having Messi in the side raises expectations for Inter Miami above what has ever been expected from any MLS side, and they can reach those but not winning MLS Cup will only bring more questions to the side.\n            ",

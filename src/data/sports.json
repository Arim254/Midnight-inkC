    "body": "\n        Could a third straight Thursday Night Football upset be in the cards for this week? The Cincinnati Bengals are 2-4 and losers of four straight games, but look to take a step forward as they host the 4-1 Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 7. With quarterback Joe Flacco recently acquired from Cleveland at the helm, the Bengals are looking to keep the slim playoff hopes alive with an important AFC North victory. According to the latest NFL odds, Pittsburgh is favored by 5.5 points, and Flacco's over/under for total passing yards is 232.5.

By rule, if a player suffers an injury and his team wishes to replace him, MLB must approve the transaction and the player can't be re-activated in either the current round of the playoffs or the next round. Given that the World Series comes next, this is it for Santander in 2025. Outfielder Joey Loperfido has replaced Santander on the Jays' ALCS roster.Santander was a late scratch from the Blue Jays' Game 2 lineup due to his back issues. He returned to the lineup in Game 3, but was replaced in the lineup after three plate appearances.  \"Yeah, I think just the game in general did,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Thursday when asked if Santander had aggravated something in his back during Game 3. \"He was pretty stiff, sore after. Checked in with him this morning and still felt it, so wanted to hold off as long as we could. But just in talking to him and after getting some treatment, it still felt like it wasn't the right thing to do to put him out there.\"\nLoperfido in the regular season hit .333/.379/.500 in just 104 plate appearances. Santander, 30, signed a five-year, $92.5 million deal with the Blue Jays last offseason after a 44-homer, 102-RBI season with the Orioles in 2024. His first season in Toronto was marred by injury and poor play. He hit .175/.271/.294 (57 OPS+, after a 131 OPS+ in 2024) with six home runs and 18 RBI in 54 games. He posted a -1.0 WAR. In five playoff games, he was 3 for 15 (.200) with two RBI.\nThe Blue Jays are down 2-1 in the ALCS to the Seattle Mariners with Game 4 scheduled for Thursday night.\n            \n    ",

The Brewers' youngster has been battling a right hamstring injury and appeared to re-aggravate it. Blake Perkins entered the game in place of Chourio after this: \nPerkins swung through strike three, but since Chourio was down two strikes in the count, he was charged with the K. That means in Game 3, he went 0 for 4. Prior to the game, he was hitting .320/.333/.640 with two doubles, two home runs, eight RBI and three runs in seven playoff games this season.After the game, the Brewers announced that Chourio had \"continual cramps\" in his hamstring and that they were hopeful he'd be ready to go for Game 4.\"He feels like he's going to be okay,\" manager Pat Murphy said. \"So I'm hopeful. He's got an IV going right now, and we'll hope he's OK.\"\nChourio was out from July 30-Aug. 29 due to a right hamstring injury before returning for the last few days of August and all of September. He tweaked his right hamstring again in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Cubs, forcing him to leave the game after just two innings. He returned for Game 2 and has started each game since, but he's been visibly hampered running the bases. He still managed to hit a leadoff home run in Game 2 of the NLCS on Tuesday. \n            \n    ",

After dominant starts from Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow couldn't quite go the distance in Game 3, but the offense put up enough runs to get the job done. They'll go for the clinch Friday in Game 4.The Brewers, the top overall seed in Major League Baseball's postseason, became the fourth and final team to advance to the league championship round on Saturday night. The Brewers advanced to their first NLCS since 2018 when they defeated the Chicago Cubs in Game 5 of their NLDS matchup to take the best-of-five series by a 3-2 margin.Whereas the Dodgers are making their fourth NLCS appearance in six years, the Brewers have reached this stage just twice since moving to the NL in 1998: back in 2018 (when they met the Dodgers) and in 2011, when they were knocked off by the St. Louis Cardinals. The Dodgers are attempting to become MLB's first repeat World Series champions since the New York Yankees won three in a row in 1998-2000.\nDodgers vs. Brewers scheduleDateStart time/scoreTVLive streamGame 1Mon., Oct. 13LAD 2, MIL 1TBSHBO MaxGame 2Tue., Oct. 14LAD 5, MIL 1TBSHBO MaxGame 3Thur., Oct. 16LAD 3, MIL 1TBSHBO MaxGame 4Fri., Oct. 178:38 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxGame 5 (if nec.)Sat., Oct. 188:08 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxGame 6 (if nec.)Mon., Oct. 205:08 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxGame 7 (if nec.)Tue., Oct. 218:08 p.m. ETTBSHBO MaxDodgers vs. Brewers: Game 4 infoTime: 8:08 p.m. ET | Date: Friday, Oct. 17Location: Dodger Stadium -- Los AngelesTV channel: TBS | Live stream: HBO MaxStarting pitchers: RHP Shohei Ohtani (LAD) vs. TBA (MIL)Odds: Dodgers -187, Brewers +152 (via DraftKings)\nGame 4 storylinesDodgers: Well, this one's pretty easy. One win and they're in. Normally, we'd say easier said than done, but given how the Dodgers have breezed through this series so far, it might be just that easy.Brewers: The Brewers have scored a combined three runs in the first three games of this series. Suffice to say, that won't get it done. It doesn't matter who's on the mound. The offense simply has to figure it out if they want to stand any chance at winning a game, let alone four.\nGame 4 predictionThe Dodgers have Ohtani on the mound and a well-rested bullpen to back him up. On the Milwaukee side, the pitching staff is in much worse shape, the offense can't score runs, and Jackson Chourio might not be 100%. The Dodgers close it out 4-2 and advance to the World Series again. -- Dayn Perry\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nThree teams remain in contention for two playoff spots when Week 20 of the 2025 CFL season takes place this weekend. One of those clubs is the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, who kick off the week by hosting the West Division champion Saskatchewan Roughriders at 8 p.m. ET on Friday at Princess Auto Stadium.Winnipeg (8-8) can clinch a postseason berth with a victory against Saskatchewan (12-4) and a loss by the Edmonton Elks, who visit BC Place to take on the BC Lions at 10:30 p.m. ET on Friday. The Blue Bombers have struggled of late as their 25-20 setback at Edmonton last week was their fourth loss in six games.The Roughriders defeated the Toronto Argonauts 27-19 in Week 19 for their second straight win and are 2-0 against Winnipeg this year despite having trailed by 10 points in each meeting. With nothing at stake, Saskatchewan likely will begin preparing for the playoffs and rest some of its starters.Edmonton (7-9) has a difficult road to a playoff spot, as it needs to win its final two games of the season and either Winnipeg or the Calgary Stampeders lose both of theirs. The Elks have posted back-to-back victories but are 0-2 against BC this year and have lost 10 of their last 11 meetings with the Lions.BC (9-7), which already has punched its ticket to the postseason, is coming off its final bye of the campaign but enters this matchup with a four-game winning streak. Quarterback Nathan Rourke was superb in both of the Lions' triumphs over the Elks this year, throwing for at least 320 yards in each contest while throwing for a combined five touchdowns.Saturday also features a doubleheader that begins at 3 p.m. ET, when the Ottawa Redblacks host the Montreal Alouettes at TD Place. Ottawa (4-12) is coming off its fourth consecutive loss and sixth in seven games, a 30-10 setback at Montreal last week.The Alouettes (9-7) have clinched a playoff berth but still can capture the East Division title, as a victory against the Redblacks would move them into a tie with the idle Hamilton Tiger-Cats for first place. Montreal then would need to defeat Winnipeg in the final week of the season and have Ottawa knock off Hamilton.Since suffering a 38-24 loss against the Redblacks in Week 13 of the 2022 campaign, the Alouettes have won 10 consecutive meetings between the teams - including two this year. Montreal now will be looking to sweep the season series and extend its overall winning streak to five games.Week 20 concludes when Toronto visits McMahon Stadium to battle Calgary at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. The Stampeders (9-7), who ended their four-game losing streak with last week's 37-20 triumph at Hamilton, will secure a spot in the postseason with a victory.This is the season finale for the reigning Grey Cup champions Argonauts (5-12), whose loss at Saskatchewan last week was their fourth in a row. Toronto hopes to go out on a high note and complete a sweep of the season series after having defeated Calgary 29-19 at home in Week 2.Winnipeg is a 7.5-point favorite against Saskatchwan at FanDuel Sportsbook, while Edmonton is a 5.5-point underdog versus BC. Meanwhile, Montreal is favored by 10.5 points in its matchup with Ottawa and Calgary is -9.5 against Toronto.SportsLine football expert Emory Hunt is 39-34 on his CFL picks this year and has revealed his selections for Week 20 of the 2025 CFL season, including against-the-spread predictions and leans on the total of every game.Hunt is the founder and CEO of Football Gameplan, which has been supplying analysis of all levels of football since 2007. He is a former running back for the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns and knows the game from a player's perspective. Hunt's dedication to analysis of all levels of professional football helped him crush the CFL, XFL and USFL in 2023, posting a combined ATS record of 98-73 in his SportsLine articles.Saskatchewan Roughriders at Winnipeg Blue Bombers (Friday, 8 p.m. ET)Pick: Saskatchewan +7.5Lean: Under 48.5The Roughriders will be resting a bevy of key starters and contributors in this game since they've already secured a spot in the postseason. Predicting how reserves will perform in a matchup against starters on a team that needs to win to stay alive in the playoff hunt always is a challenge. I will take the safe approach and side with the squad that would love to keep a division rival out of the postseason. That's the Roughriders. Edmonton Elks at BC Lions (Friday, 10:30 p.m. ET)Pick: Edmonton +5.5Lean: Over 56.5We haven't seen these two square off since July, when the Elks were a totally different team. Now, this Edmonton club is vying for a playoff spot. We saw the Elks take care of business against Winnipeg last weekend and they can move closer to their goal with a great showing against the Lions, who already have clinched a postseason berth. Expect Edmonton's best effort as its playoff hopes are fading but still alive.Montreal Alouettes at Ottawa Redblacks (Saturday, 3 p.m. ET)Pick: Montreal -10.5Lean: Over 50.5Last week's performance was an ugly one by the Redblacks, and it's tough to see how they can turn things around quickly enough to avoid a similar result. In fact, expect more of the same from the Alouettes, especially considering how chippy the game was late in the fourth quarter. With Montreal likely using its reserves, the intensity of the rivalry remains.Toronto Argonauts at Calgary Stampeders (Saturday, 7 p.m. ET)Pick: Calgary -9.5Lean: Over 52.5The Stampeders are in the driver's seat in the race for a playoff spot, but they haven't really played particularly well down the stretch if we're being honest. In comes a Toronto team that hasn't had a quarterback come up with an impressive performance all season. Look for Calgary to treat this as a \"Get Right\" game as it hopes to punch its ticket to the postseason.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nineteen-year-old Spanish center Awa Fam showed why she is the potential No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 WNBA Draft, and the best international player in the class, with a strong showing against Fenerbahce in EuroLeague Women action on Thursday. This was the first major test for Fam this season, and she passed with flying colors. The Turkish giants Fenerbahce, a perennial powerhouse in the competition, pulled off a 13-point comeback to take down Valencia in an overtime thriller, but Fam's performance was the main headline -- certainly from a WNBA perspective. Fam finished with 17 points, seven rebounds and three steals on 7 of 11 from the field, including 2 of 2 from 3-point range, in 33 minutes. Even though Emma Meesseman did not play due to the passing of her grandfather, Fam still went up against a WNBA-caliber frontcourt of Monique Billings and Iliana Rupert and more than held her own. The 6-foot-4 Fam is an extremely fluid athlete, and her versatility at her size on both sides of the ball is the major reason she's such a highly rated prospect. While she didn't do much playmaking against Fenerbahce, her full scoring arsenal was on display. Let's take a run through some of the tape. \nRunning the floorFam's first basket came late in the first quarter -- she doesn't start, but she checks in for former WNBA veteran Kayla Alexander late in the first and third quarters and usually plays the remainder of the half -- when she sprinted in transition and beat everyone down the floor. \nPick-and-roll finishingIn the halfcourt, Fam is a willing and active screener, which not only helps her teammates get open, but also frees her up to roll to the basket. Notably, she had three different pick-and-roll finishes against Fenerbahce: A dive to the rim with a full head of steam, where she avoided the defense to finishA short roll where she stopped and hit a mid-range jumperA traditional roll where she caught the ball under the basket in traffic and finished\nShootingOne of the few question marks about Fam is whether she'll develop a consistent outside shot. Against Fenerbahce, she had a few jumpers that looked a bit rushed, but her 3-point shooting was on point. She made both of her 3-point attempts from catch-and-shoot opportunities. \nPost scoringMany young players get bullied in the post by veterans, who are often stronger and know the tricks of the trade. Fam, however, already has the physicality and footwork to succeed down low. Late in the fourth quarter, she made that abundantly clear with a brilliant possession against Billings, where she backed her down to get to her spot, then pivoted all around until she was clear for a little jump hook. \nThis was only one game, but if Fam is already doing this at 19 years old against WNBA competition, it's easy to envision a future in which she's one of the best players in the world. There's still a long way to go until next spring, but Fam has a real chance to become the first international player to go No. 1 overall since Lauren Jackson in 2001. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- For the first time in over a month, Joe Burrow is in attendance to watch his team play. The Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback hasn't been to a game since injuring his toe in Week 2, but he's in the building at Paycor Stadium for the team's huge Thursday night showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Burrow has been sidelined since Sept. 14 when he suffered a Grade 3 turf toe injury during the first half of a 31-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. The superstar quarterback underwent surgery just five days later and he's been rehabbing ever since. The Bengals had a home game in Week 5 that Burrow could have attended, but he decided to stay home, which might have been for the best, because Ja'Marr Chase didn't want him there. \"Hell no. He needs to get ready,\" Ja'Marr Chase said when asked if Burrow should attend the Week 5 game against the Lions. \"They don't need to see Joe's face. Just get healthy, come around later.\" \n        \n            \n                Steelers vs. Bengals prediction: Can Aaron Rodgers keep rolling as Cincinnati fights to stay alive?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Bengals hit the road in Week 6 for a game against the Packers and Burrow obviously didn't go to that, but he was on the field during pregame on Thursday. \nBurrow was in a boot, but he was able to walk on his own, which is definitely an encouraging sign for the Bengals. \nSo when will Burrow return? When Burrow underwent surgery on Sept. 19, he was staring at a timeline of roughly three months and that still seems to be the case. According to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport, Burrow is targeting a mid-December return and he \"absolutely intends\" to comeback. \"He is on track, has had no setbacks,\" Rapoport said Thursday, \"If this continues in that direction, he should be back on the field in mid-December and has told people close to him that he absolutely intends to be back, just needs the team to stay alive until then.\"That last sentence is the key part here; Burrow is likely only going to return if the Bengals are still in the playoff race and that might explain why he decided to attend the game on Thursday. At 2-4, the Bengals' season is essentially on the line against the Steelers. If they win, they'll be 3-4 and right back in the thick of the AFC North, but if they lose, they'll drop to 2-5, and at that point, it's hard to envision a scenario where they'd still be in playoff contention come December. \nIf he returns in mid-December, that means he'd likely be back on the field in either Week 15 (vs. Ravens) or Week 16 (at Dolphins). For the Bengals to stay in playoff contention, they'd likely need to go 5-2 or 5-3 before getting to mid-December, so Joe Flacco will need to keep the team afloat if the Bengals are hoping to get their other Joe back. \n            ",

Tkachuk suffered the injury in the Senators' home-opener against the Nashville Predators on Monday.In the first period of the Sens' home-opener, Tkachuk was cross-checked into the boards by Predators defenseman Roman Josi, who was assessed a minor penalty on the play. Tkachuk returned to the game in a limited capacity, but he was noticeably absent when Ottawa pushed to tie the game late.\nAfter further evaluation, it was determined that Tkachuk needed surgery to repair the thumb. He now faces an extended absence, and the Senators have to stay afloat without one of their best players.The No. 4 overall pick in the 2018 NHL Draft, Tkachuk evolved into one of the best players in the league. From 2021-24, Tkachuk eclipsed the 30-goal mark in three consecutive seasons. Last year, Tkachuk 's offensive numbers dipped, but his five-on-five impacts were quite strong as he led Ottawa back to the playoffs for the first time since 2017.\nWith Tkachuk out for up to two months, the rest of the roster will have to pick up the slack in order to remain in the thick of the playoff race. Star center Tim Stützle will obviously be key to that, but how much can the Sens get out of players like Dylan Cozens and Shane Pinto? Their depth will be tested in a competitive Atlantic Division.\n            \n    ",

Through three quarters against the Steelers, Chase has caught 12 passes for 109 yards. That makes Chase just the second receiver in NFL history to have a 100-yard receiving game with three different starting quarterbacks through the first seven games of a team's season. The only other receiver to pull it off was Jimmy Smith, who accomplished the feat with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1997. (His quarterbacks were Rob Johnson, Steve Matthews and Mark Brunell.) As for Chase, he hit the 100-yard mark with Flacco on Thursday night against the Steelers. Before hitting 100 yards, Chase opened up the scoring for the Bengals in the second quarter with a short touchdown catch. \nBesides Flacco, Chase has also had a 100-yard receiving game with both Joe Burrow and Jaken Browning as his starting quarterbacks this season. In Week 2, Burrow was the starter and although he didn't finish the game, Chase went off for 165 yards in a 31-27 win over the Jaguars. In Week 5, Browning was his starter and he finished with 110 yards in a 37-24 loss to the Lions. The Bengals' season started with Burrow at quarterback, but after Burrow suffered a toe injury in Week 2, they were forced to turn to Browning. However, the Browning experiment only lasted three weeks before he was sent to the bench in favor of Flacco, who was brought in to save the season after Cincinnati made a trade with Cleveland. \nIt doesn't matter who's under center for Cincinnati, as long as they can throw a forward pass, Chase will put up big numbers with them. \n            \n    ",

Given all of the injuries Washington has seen at receiver recently, Burks, who spent his entire career with the Tennessee Titans before being waived earlier this month, could be elevated quickly.Commanders star wideout Terry McLaurin has missed the last three games with a quad injury, and did not practice on Thursday after being limited on Wednesday. Deebo Samuel is also dealing with a heel injury that has held him out of practice this week, and Noah Brown was recently placed on injured reserve. \n        \n            \n                Predicting overreactions for NFL Week 7: Trey Hendrickson done with Bengals?

He caught four passes for just 15 yards. Chris Moore was actually the Commanders' leading receiver in Week 6 with 46 yards and a touchdown on three receptions. Moore, Luke McCaffrey and rookie Jaylin Lane have been called upon to step up in the past few weeks.\nDespite the thin receiver corps, the Commanders, now 3-3 on the year, are 1.5-point road favorites (via FanDuel) against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. Burks reportedly visited with Washington this week. The former No. 18 overall pick cleared waivers earlier this month after Tennessee parted ways with him following three unproductive seasons. He has played just 27 career games, and caught 53 passes for 699 yards and one touchdown. Burks has struggled to stay on the field, having never played more than 11 games in a single season. He tore his ACL in practice late last season, then broke his collarbone in training camp just three months ago. \nThe 25-year-old pass-catcher certainly needed a change of scenery, and could potentially get his career on track in Washington. Burks has legitimate size at 6-foot-2, 225 pounds, and was a versatile playmaker during his days at the University of Arkansas.\n            \n    ",

The Blue Jays have tied the ALCS with a Game 4 win Thursday, the second straight victory after dropping the first two games to the Seattle Mariners. That essentially turns this into a best-of-three series, with one more game in Seattle before returning to Toronto.The Blue Jays haven't been to the ALCS since 2016 and haven't been to the World Series since 1993. The Mariners haven't been to this round since 2001 and have never won the AL pennant. They remain the only team of 30 in MLB to have never played in the World Series. They'll have their chance to advance here, but they have to deal with a hungry Blue Jays team.Mariners vs. Blue Jays scheduleDateStart time/scoreTVLive streamGame 1Sun., Oct. 12SEA 3, TOR 1FoxfuboGame 2Mon., Oct. 13SEA 10, TOR 3FoxfuboGame 3Wed., Oct. 15TOR 13, SEA 4FS1fuboGame 4Thurs., Oct. 16TOR 8, SEA 2FS1fuboGame 5Fri., Oct. 176:08 p.m. ETFS1fuboGame 6 (if nec.)Sun., Oct. 198:03 p.m. ETFS1fuboGame 7 (if nec.)Mon., Oct. 208:08 p.m. ETFoxfuboMariners vs. Blue Jays: Game 5 infoTime: 6:08 p.m. ET | Date: Friday, Oct. 17Location: T-Mobile Park -- Seattle, Wash.TV channel: FS1 | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Starting pitchers: RHP Bryce Miller (SEA) vs. RHP Kevin Gausman (TOR)Odds: Blue Jays -116, Mariners -105 (via DraftKings)\nGame 4 storylinesMariners: We've got ourselves a ballgame, boys and girls.

Seattle still has the pitching advantage and Bryce Miller looked excellent last time out. Can they find that magic again?Blue Jays: The Blue Jays, on the other hand, have the momentum and what sure seems like a strong urge to remind everyone why they were the best team in the American League during the regular season. The bats have gotten them this far.

    "body": "\n        Penn State quarterback Drew Allar underwent successful surgery on Wednesday to address his broken left ankle, according to ESPN's Pete Thamel. Allar sustained the injury -- the extent of which had not been divulged -- last Saturday in the Nittany Lions' 22-21 loss to Northwestern, and former coach James Franklin announced at the time that the fourth-year quarterback would miss the rest of the season.Allar is reportedly on track to make a full recovery, and he could be cleared to return to workouts in the coming months.The injury occurred in the closing minutes of Penn State's third straight loss, one that led the program to fire Franklin in the highest-profile and most surprising coaching change of the 2025 college football season. Allar tucked the ball for a scramble with just over three minutes left in the fourth quarter, and he fell awkwardly upon contact with two Northwestern defenders. He spent several minutes on the turf before trainers assisted him to the sideline and eventually carted him into the locker room.\n        \n            \n                The failure to develop QB Drew Allar sealed James Franklin's fate at Penn State\n                \n                    Brian Dohn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAllar, a three-year starter who led Penn State to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season, finished the year as a 64.8% passer with 1,100 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions. He ran into trouble in the final weeks of his season with a string of underwhelming performances in losses to Oregon, UCLA and Northwestern. The Nittany Lions, in turn, fell from national title contention to afterthoughts in the Big Ten with losses to a pair of conference bottom-dwellers.\nWhat are Drew Allar's next steps?Given that 2025 is Allar's final year of eligibility, the ankle injury almost certainly brought an unfortunate end to his college career. He could submit a medical hardship waiver application to seek a fifth year of eligibility, but given that he participated in more than 30% of Penn State's regular-season games, it is unlikely the waiver would be approved. Unless the NCAA changes its eligibility rules to add a fifth year, Allar will now turn his attention toward the NFL Draft.Though Allar considered leaving for the NFL after last season, this was supposed to be a year for Allar to both lead Penn State to a national title and further boost his pro prospects. His stock took a tumble during his career as Penn State's starter as he struggled to deliver on the lofty expectations placed on him as a former five-star recruit. Allar displayed ample promise in his debut season in the role when he led the Big Ten with 25 touchdowns and threw just two interceptions, but he failed to replicate those numbers in the years since.NFL teams will be tasked with weighing Allar's still-tantalizing physical tools with his up-and-down production. They must also determine how much of his ceiling was capped by Penn State's lackluster run of wide receivers -- or to what extent those receivers underwhelmed because of Allar.\nThe Nittany Lions, meanwhile, will turn to redshirt freshman Ethan Grunkenmeyer as they continue their season on the road against Iowa on Saturday under interim coach Terry Smith. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        An old-school AFC North rivalry kicks off NFL Week 7 with the Pittsburgh Steelers visiting the Cincinnati Bengals on 'Thursday Night Football.' Pittsburgh (4-1) has won three straight, including a 23-9 victory over Cleveland on Sunday, and the Steelers are 2-0 on the road this season. Cincinnati (2-4) has lost four in a row since losing Joe Burrow to injury, and the Bengals suffered a 27-18 loss to Green Bay in Week 6. These teams split their two matchups last season, with the road team winning each game. Cincinnati's Trey Hendrickson (hip) is out as the Bengals will be missing the reigning sacks leader. Calvin Austin (shoulder) is out for Pittsburgh.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh has won each of its last three trips to Cincy. The latest Bengals vs. Steelers  odds have Pittsburgh as the 5.5-point favorite. The over/under for total points is 45. Pittsburgh is at -257 on the money line (risk $257 to win $100), with Cincy at +208 (risk $100 to win $208). Before making any Steelers vs. Bengals picks, be sure to see what the SportsLine projection model has to say. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Aaron Rodgers' 105.4 passer rating is the sixth-highest of his career, and of the five years in which he had a better rating, he won NFL MVP in four of them. Rodgers also has the third-highest completion percentage and touchdown rate of his career, while his pairing with DK Metcalf has hit its stride. The former Seahawk has touchdown receptions in four straight games, as he's just one touchdown catch away from matching his total from last season (five).The Steelers' +7 turnover differential is the second-best in the league, and even if they don't notch a takeaway, the defense can still produce elite performances. That's what occurred on Sunday as Pittsburgh's nine points allowed to Cleveland were the fewest the Steelers have given up all year. Another dominant defensive effort can be expected on Thursday versus a Cincinnati team which ranks in the bottom four in the key stats of points scored, yards gained, rushing offense and passing offense. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bengals can coverCincinnati is coming off a road loss to Green Bay, but there were some promising signs for the Bengals. One is that the team covered, after losing three straight ATS, and another was the performance of Joe Flacco, just days after being acquired by the team. Flacco provided a spark for the offense as he had two touchdown passes and no turnovers, compared to Jake Browning, who failed to have more touchdowns than turnovers in any of his four games. Ja'Marr Chase had a 10-94-1 stat line as his 12th career game with 10-plus catches and a touchdown are now tied for fourth-most in NFL history.Cincy is a perfect 4 for 4 in red-zone scoring over their last two games, and it ranks second in the NFL in red-zone conversion percentage this season. That could be a bad omen for Pittsburgh, as its defense isn't quite on par with prior seasons. The Steelers are 26th in total defense, 27th in passing defense and haven't experienced much recent success in flustering Flacco. The 40-year-old has played turnover-free ball versus the Steelers over his last three games versus them. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Steelers vs. Bengals picksFor the NFL Week 7 Thursday Night Football game of Bengals vs. Steelers, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 46 total points.

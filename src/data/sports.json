    "body": "\n        Brett Favre has no interest in coaching college football. He expressed understanding as to why seven-time national champion Nick Saban made the same choice by retiring retired at Alabama. Asked hypothetically what he would implement as the leader of a college football program in 2025, Favre immediately turned the conversation to the sport's predicament.\"Really, I think the state of college football or college athletics is one of the major reasons, if not the only reason, why Nick Saban left,\" Favre said on this week's \"4th and Favre.\" \"It's not necessarily about, really, it isn't about recruiting a player, signing him, developing him throughout his four years, maybe he gets five years with a redshirt. ... It's not about that anymore. It's about you go in and you recruit a kid and he says, 'How much are you going to pay me, coach?' And that's a different game than I'm used to. I'm not saying it's right, I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying that's the way it is right now. And I wouldn't know where to start, to be honest with you.\"If you're tough on your team and your players, they may just leave and go somewhere else and play. So, do you keep your style and the way you want to coach, or do you alter it because of the state of the game today? I don't know. I think the older coaches certainly have a harder time with it, I would think, than the younger coaches because they're entrenched in the old school mentality and it's hard to shift gears and back off.\"Before announcing his retirement following a playoff loss to Michigan, Saban revealed that a majority of his Alabama players were worried about an increased role on the team the following season or financial gain through NIL initiatives, with talk of the transfer portal looming as a sort of leverage. That bothered Saban, though he said at the time it wasn't the exclusive reason he walked away.\nIronically, Saban brought up player entitlement earlier this season following Mike Gundy's firing at Oklahoma State. Like Favre, Saban alluded to coaches of yesteryear struggling to come to grips with the new norm.\"Some people have a tougher time embracing the whole idea of paying players, especially some of us old timers,\" Saban said. \"It's a little more difficult. Mike Gundy has been a great coach for a long time. Coaching is teaching, and teaching is the ability to inspire learning. For those of us who kind of get that and that's been our self-gratification for so many years, embracing paying the players has been a little bit harder, and I think that ultimately is what got them at Oklahoma State.\"\nSaban has long been an advocate for revenue sharing, but never wanted \"players to be employees\" and has balked at loosely-regulated NIL collectives in the public space.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After his team blew out the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel seemingly felt like rubbing salt in the wound. Bills fans that gathered at a local watering hole in Miami got a visit from someone who looked an awful lot like McDaniel.In the most surprising result of the NFL's Week 10 slate, the Dolphins hammered the Bills for a 30-13 win. It was just Miami's third win of the season, and it seems McDaniel might have been feeling himself in the aftermath.After the game, someone who bore a striking resemblance to McDaniel pulled up beside Elbo Room, a favorite bar for Bills fans when their team is in town. The McDaniel look-alike (or perhaps the man himself) then trolled Buffalo fans before driving away.\nAt his Monday press conference, McDaniel expertly sidestepped questions about whether that was him outside Elbo Room, although he admitted to living in the neighborhood.\"That's why I like the good old days when you could trust the internet and the images because that is pretty detailed,\" McDaniel said. \"I do live in that area. I mean, AI, right?\"\nWhen it was pointed out that McDaniel never really denied the allegations, he remained coy.\"I live in that area,\" McDaniel said. \"AI is real. That's what I got for ya.\"\nDolphins star receiver Tyreek Hill, who is out for the season with a knee injury, seems to think it was his coach. Hill went on social media and praised McDaniel (or whoever it was) for twisting the knife.\nRegardless of whether that was actually McDaniel, it's hard to blame the Dolphins for basking in the glow of that win. It's been a trying season in Miami, and general manager Chris Grier has already been fired. With the future of McDaniel and his staff in the air, the Dolphins showed some fight and blew out a bona fide Super Bowl contender.\nWith the Washington Commanders coming to town next week, McDaniel or his impersonator may have another chance to swing by Elbo Room to celebrate a win.\n            ",

While the top six teams remained the same, with reigning national champion UConn on top, there was movement elsewhere.Baylor and USC were the biggest winners and have earned their ticket to the top 10. Baylor climbed nine spots to No. 7 after opening the season in Paris with a 58-52 win against then-No. 7 Duke. Neither team shot the ball particularly well, but that win can still give the Bears confidence as they move forward. The Blue Devils found more offense in their 91-48 win against Holy Cross on Sunday but still went down to No. 15.Meanwhile, the Trojans entered the 2025-26 campaign in rebuilding mode after losing key players to the WNBA and transfer portal, and star player JuJu Watkins to a torn ACL. Regardless, they showed their potential on Sunday with a gutsy 69-68 victory over NC State -- a team that beat Tennessee in its season opener. Lindsay Gottlieb's squad moved up 10 spots to No. 8. While that was not the result NC State had hoped for, Wes Moore's Wolfpack only dropped one spot to No. 10. USC can't relax because its next opponent will be No. 2 South Carolina. They will face off at the iconic Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Saturday night. Another key game this week is on Monday night, when No. 3 UCLA takes on No. 6 Oklahoma. Cori Close said her Bruins came out flat in their season opener against San Diego State, but are 2-0 after an 87-50 win against UC Santa Barbara while showing that they are a lot deeper than star Lauren Betts.\nAP Women's Basketball Top 25RankTeamRecordPointsPrev.1UConn2-0798 (30)12South Carolina2-0761 (2)23UCLA2-073234Texas2-070845LSU3-067256Oklahoma1-061467Baylor2-0509168USC2-0500189Marylad3-04981010NC State1-1479911North Carolina2-04711112Tennessee2-1420813Ole Miss2-04111214Michigan2-03981315Duke1-1390716Iowa State3-03771417TCU2-02951718Notre Dame 2-02851519Vanderbilt1-02031920Oklahoma State4-01672221Iowa2-01552122Louisville1-11492023Kentucky3-01192424Michigan State2-01112325Washington1-058NROthers receiving votes: Ohio St. 27, Princeton 19, Richmond 16, West Virginia 15, Kansas St 11, Minnesota 10, South Dakota St. 6, Kansas 5, Stanford 4, Columbia 4, Nebraska 2, Fairfield 1.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Cooper Flagg's NBA career hasn't started the way many anticipated it would. When you carry the weight of being the No. 1 overall draft pick and titles like \"generational talent\" are attached to your name, there's an expectation that you're going to set the league on fire as soon as you suit up for your first game. That hasn't happened in Dallas. Instead, it's been a pretty ugly start with the Mavericks.Through 10 games, the Mavericks are just 3-7 and have the worst offense in the league. They have a top-5 defense but can't capitalize on the other end for it to matter. Flagg has spent most of the first 10 games playing out of position, as Jason Kidd's experiment to have his 18-year-old rookie be the team's point guard has gone about as bad as it possibly could go. He's averaging 13.9 points, 6.6 rebounds and three assists, but his efficiency has cratered from what many saw from him at Duke. Flagg's shooting just 40.3% from the field and 27% from 3-point range. A lot of that is to be expected from a rookie still feeling out the flow of a pro game, but some of it is because of Dallas' poorly run offense, regardless of what role Flagg's playing.On 38 pick-and-roll possessions, Flagg's generating just 0.658 points per possession, which ranks in the 20th percentile. He's still figuring out how to make the best reads based on what the defense is giving him, which is completely normal for a kid who doesn't turn 19 until just before Christmas. But having Flagg run point to begin with seems like a massive ask this early in his career, especially when the results have been this poor to start out. He's never played point guard in his life, and while it may help him down the line, to throw him into the fire immediately instead of playing to his strengths seems like an ill-fated plan.But even when Kidd made the adjustment to start D'Angelo Russell, whom they signed this summer to handle the point guard duties until Kyrie Irving returned, things haven't gone much better.\nOver the last three games with Russell in the starting lineup alongside Flagg, PJ Washington, Max Christie and Daniel Gafford, the Mavericks' offensive rating is 78.4. For comparison, the 2002-03 Nuggets hold the record for the lowest offensive rating in NBA history at 92.2.An obvious asterisk could be applied to that number, given Anthony Davis has missed the last five games with a calf strain. But it's not as if Davis is a cure for the Mavericks' current issue. They've actually performed better offensively when he's on the bench, scoring 2.0 points more per 100 possessions. And thinking that Irving will be the superhero who can save Dallas' season would be unrealistic for a 33-year-old guard working his way back from an ACL tear. And that's assuming he's able to return soon enough for it to matter.Irving can mask a lot of issues for the Mavericks, giving them an elite playmaker who can create space and draw attention from the defense to make things easier for his teammates. But being the sole ball handler -- just as Luka Doncic was for several seasons in Dallas -- has not been a successful way to win games. \nThe issue isn't just that the Mavericks don't have a quality enough point guard on the roster to make everyone's life easier. It's that this roster is void of any quality shot creators, playmakers, shooters or simply anyone who can force the defense to second guess anything. Despite an abundance of forwards and centers, the Mavericks generate just 20.3 paint touches a game. They're averaging 48.8 points in the paint, but are giving up 55.6 points inside per game. What was supposed to be a point of strength for the Mavericks this season has been a non-factor. So many of Dallas' possessions stall out on the perimeter because they don't have anyone to penetrate the defense and get inside. Brandon Williams is the best at getting to the rim, and he's only playing 16.5 minutes. Dallas is taking the most mid-range shots since the year before they traded for Dončić on draft night in 2018. Right now it's the only shot they can make, as they rank 30th in 3-point shooting and 26th in shots at the rim, per Cleaning the Glass.\nMavericks' shot profileShot typeFrequency (League rank)Accuracy (League rank)Rim31.4% (17th)63.5% (26th)Mid-range34.4% (5th)44.3% (9th)3-pointers34.2% (25th)30.4% (30th)Nothing is coming easy offensively for the Mavericks. You have Washington averaging a career high in turnovers (2.8) because he's being asked to create and score off the dribble, which isn't his strong suit. Flagg is struggling to find a rhythm because he's playing out of position. Klay Thompson's efficiency and production, two pillars of his Hall of Fame career, have completely fallen off a cliff. His shot selection has been questionable at times and completely off mark the rest of the time. He's shooting a surprising 26.4% from 3-point range, far below his career average of 41.4%. Some regression was expected from one of the best shooters in NBA history, but not this bad.This isn't an easily fixable problem for the Mavericks; it's an issue that only seems repairable through a trade (or several). Seeing what they can get for Anthony Davis is worth considering, though that would take Nico Harrison admitting any wrongdoing in the disastrous trade from February 2024. Davis could net the Mavericks some help in the backcourt, so could trading Daniel Gafford, who continues to draw interest around the league, mainly from the Lakers.The irony of the situation is that the solution to this issue is currently averaging 37 points on the Lakers. The answer is a guy the Mavericks front office deemed wasn't good enough to lead them to a championship. The even more ironic aspect of all this is that had the Mavericks got Austin Reaves in that Dončić trade, these problems also wouldn't be as glaring.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles will visit the Green Bay Packers on 'Monday Night Football' to conclude NFL Week 10. Big names like Jalen Hurts, Jordan Love, Saquon Barkley and Josh Jacobs will likely populate NFL DFS lineups in this matchup of Super Bowl contenders. When these teams last met in the Wild Card Round last season, Jahan Dotson and Dallas Goedert found the end zone, so your daily Fantasy football strategy shouldn't just focus on the big names when searching for NFL DFS picks.Deep threat Christian Watson is averaging 71.5 receiving yards in his two games since being activated off IR and has seemingly leapfrogged rookie Matthew Golden, who is questionable (shoulder) for this game, on the depth chart. Watson could be one of those Monday Night Football DFS picks whose production far exceeds his NFL DFS price tags.

The reigning Super Bowl MVP is having the most efficient year of his six-year career, with career highs in passer rating, completion percentage and touchdown-to-interception ratio. His best two games of the season have been his last two, in which he combined for seven touchdown passes and no turnovers.On SNF, he'll face a Packers defense which has the second-fewest takeaways, so you likely don't have to worry about Hurts losing you any Fantasy points. He should also rack up plenty of points, considering Green Bay has allowed four of the last five QBs it has faced to pass for multiple touchdowns. Also, Hurts has a positive history versus the Packers as he had a pair of two-touchdown games versus Green Bay in last year's regular plus postseason. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Packers tight end Luke Musgrave. He becomes Green Bay's No. 1 tight end with the season-ending injury to Tucker Kraft, and Kraft entered Week 10 as the Fantasy TE1 which shows how important this position is to Green Bay's offense. Musgrave and Kraft were both drafted by the Packers in 2023, and Musgrave was taken earlier, which indicates how highly the team thinks of him.Playing in just 46.2% of snaps last week, Musgrave had three catches for 34 yards. He could see twice as many snaps going forward as Kraft routinely played over 90% of snaps in games this year. With the Eagles holding their last two opponents to under 90 rushing yards, Green Bay may lean more on the pass, raising Musgrave's NFL DFS value.

    "body": "\n        Joe Burrow returned to practice in a limited capacity on Monday, less than two months after the Bengals placed their Pro Bowl quarterback on injured reserve with turf toe. The Bengals opened Burrow's 21-day window to be activated off of injured reserve. During this period, Burrow can practice without counting against Cincinnati's 53-man roster. Burrow, who specifically suffered a Grade 3 turf toe during Cincinnati's Week 2 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, underwent surgery on September 19. The expectation has been that he could return by mid-December. \"I'm excited to get him out here,\" said Bengals coach Zac Taylor, who added that Burrow would start his reclamation process to practice by throwing routes \"on air\" to Cincinnati's pass-catchers. \nCincinnati has gone just 1-6 since Burrow's injury. Despite averaging nearly 38 points per game over the past three games, the Bengals went 1-2 over that span as defense remains an Achilles heel. Cincinnati's defense allowed an average of 39 points per game over that span that included 47 points during the Bengals' Week 9 loss to the Bears. While the Bengals' defense continues to search for answers, their offense enjoys the steadiness of 40-year quarterback Joe Flacco, whom Cincinnati acquired via a trade with the Browns after Jake Browning floundered. In four starts with the Bengals, Flacco completed 64.7% of his passes with 11 touchdowns and just two picks. \nThe top overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl in 2021, his first full season as the team's starting quarterback. He led Cincinnati to within a game of the Super Bowl the following season while gardening serious MVP consideration. Last year, Burrow won NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time after leading the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns. \nWhile Burrow is clearly progressing from a health standpoint, his team will once again rely on Flacco this week against the Steelers, a team against which Flacco has significant success throughout his 18-year-career. \nCincinnati may be without Pro Bowl pass rusher Trey Hendrickson for Sunday, though. Taylor characterized Hendrickson as doubtful for Sunday's game as he continues to deal with a hip injury that was aggravated during Cincinnati's Week 8 loss to the Jets. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        With a handful of teams searching for answers, there are a couple of intriguing position battles taking place, notably in New Orleans and Dallas. Trying to get ahead of any potential breakouts is always tough, so perhaps we can get you on the front foot.Week 4 brings with it a balanced slate, with 15 teams suiting up four times and 14 teams taking the court three times, leaving the 76ers as the only team with two games.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players during the home stretch.Four Games: ATL, CHA, CLE, DAL, GSW, LAC, LAL, MIL, NOP, ORL, PHO, POR, SAC, SAS, UTA\nThree Games: BKN, BOS, CHI, DEN, DET, HOU, IND, MEM, MIA, MIN, NYK, OKC, TOR, WASTwo Games: PHIHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the fourth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format. GuardsConsider starting: Brandon Williams, DALOpponents: MIL, PHO, LAC, PORWhile we aren't there yet, we could be nearing a situation where Williams supplants D'Angelo Russell as the starting point guard in Dallas. Williams was a popular waiver wire pickup down the stretch last season, following the season-ending injury to Kyrie Irving. After a slow start to the 2025-26 campaign, Williams has started to put things together on both ends of the floor. In his past three games, Williams has averaged 11.7 points, four assists, and 2.7 steals in 22 minutes per contest. His numbers haven't thrust him onto the standard league radar, making him not only a sneaky pickup but also a possible starting option.\nConsider starting: Collin Gillespie, PHOOpponents: NOP, @DAL, IND, ATLGillespie was red-hot to begin the season, playing a sizeable role off the bench, with Jalen Green sidelined due to a hamstring injury. The return of Green put a damper on things, with Gillespie's recent production trending in the wrong direction. However, Green re-injured his hamstring in the Suns' most recent game, an injury that could very well cost him multiple weeks. Gillespie went on to play 27 minutes in said game, finishing with 13 points, six rebounds, four assists, and four 3-pointers. This could be a situation for managers to try and get ahead of, especially if Gillespie was dropped in your league. Make sure he isn't still available, following which, consider getting him into your starting lineup.Consider sitting: Quentin Grimes, PHIOpponents: BOS, @DETGrimes has picked up where he left off last season, playing a meaningful role for the 76ers, despite continuing to come off the bench. He currently sits inside the top 110 in standard fantasy formats, averaging 17.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.4 assists, one steal, and 2.5 3-pointers in 31 minutes per game. However, Philadelphia has only two games this week, while 15 teams play four times. This could mean that Grimes is playing only half the amount of games as others on your roster. Simple math tells us this could be a case of quantity over quality, making Grimes a tough but realistic bench candidate.ForwardsConsider starting: Derik Queen, NOPOpponents: @PHO, POR, LAL, GSWThe Pelicans are going nowhere fast, beginning what could be another disappointing campaign. Coming into the season, the center rotation was far from encouraging. Nine games into the season, and it is no clearer. What is clear is that Queen is arguably the most promising option at either center or power forward. In three appearances over the past week, he has averaged 12 points, 6.7 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 2.3 steals, and 0.7 blocks in just 22.8 minutes per game. He continues to come off the bench, but it should be noted that he has been in the closing lineup on four straight occasions. There is obviously some risk here, given the current lack of direction in New Orleans, but giving Queen a shot in your starting lineup should at least be on the table.\nConsider sitting: Josh Minott, BOSOpponents: @PHI, MEM, LACMinott's roller coaster season continues, having played one of the more inconsistent and unpredictable roles in the NBA. We need only look at his past four games to see how frustrating it has been, logging 15, 34, 25, and 16 minutes. Although he will likely remain a rosterable player for the majority of the season, the uncertainty regarding his playing time from one night to the next makes him a viable bench candidate whenever the Celtics play three or fewer games.Consider sitting: Kelly Oubre Jr., PHIOpponents: BOS, @DETMuch like the Grimes situation, this is simply a matter of games played. Oubre has once again taken advantage of a favorable situation in Philadelphia, given the fact that the roster is rarely healthy. Unlike Grimes, Oubre has started in all 10 games, making this arguably a harder decision. While his numbers have been more than adequate, an argument can be made that Oubre doesn't necessarily contribute to winning basketball. The 76ers have lost three of the past four games, with Oubre being a -14 during that span. Perhaps that small piece of information is enough to convince you to give him the week off.CentersConsider starting: Kyle Filipowski, UTAOpponents: MIN, IND, ATL, CHIThis is definitely a situation where we are looking to the future and what might be, rather than what has transpired thus far this season. With Walker Kessler gone for the season due to a shoulder injury, it has been Jusuf Nurkic who has stepped into the starting center role. Filipowski, on the other hand, has seen a small bump in playing time only, averaging 8.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, one 3-pointer, and 1.4 combined steals and blocks in 20.4 minutes per game in his last three appearances. Managers would need to count on some sort of common sense from the Utah coaching staff here. Nurkic is a viable starting center, but it would make sense for Filipowski to be the priority. This is likely a situation we see at some point this season, with the question being, will that happen in the next seven days?\nConsider sitting: Isaiah Jackson, INDOpponents: @UTA, @PHO, TORJackson has done just enough in recent times, making him a worthwhile addition to standard league rosters. Over the past five games, he has averaged 11 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 1.2 steals in 22 minutes per game. While this has been encouraging, it still doesn't appear as though the coaching staff is ready to fully unleash him as a true starting center. He has played fewer than 22 minutes in three straight games, despite managing to avoid foul trouble, which plagued him earlier in the season. With some uncertainty remaining regarding his upside, shifting him to the bench during a three-game week makes sense.\n            ",

The legendary tight end is set to sign a one-day contract with the New England Patriots, allowing him to retire with the franchise that helped him win three of his four Super Bowls and establish himself as one of the greatest players to ever suit up at the position. The Patriots announced that Gronkowski will sign his short-term deal at 12:15 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\"I am signing a one-day contract with the Patriots this week coming up to retire as a Patriot and be a Patriot for life,\" Gronkowski said.The conclusion of Gronkowski's one-day stint with the Patriots marks the second time he retires in New England. The four-time first-team All-Pro stepped away from football in March 2019 at the end of a nine-year run with the Patriots, citing his injury history and the mental toll of a lengthy NFL career as reasoning for a somewhat surprising retirement at age 29.Just over a year later, though, Gronkowski came out of retirement to rejoin forces with Tom Brady as a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Patriots still held the tight end's rights at the time and traded him to the Buccaneers, allowing him to reunite with his old quarterback and make one final run to the Super Bowl. Gronkowski played two years in Tampa Bay and, for the most part, looked like his old self as a premier receiver at the tight end spot.\nIt is only fitting that Gronkowski hangs up his cleats for good as a member of the Patriots. It was in New England that the former second-round pick wrote the vast majority of his legacy as a future Hall of Famer.Among the countless accolades Gronkowski compiled with the Patriots were three Super Bowl titles, five Pro Bowl selections, an NFL Comeback Player of the Year honor and the 2011 receiving touchdowns crown. He accumulated a bevy of team and league records and became the first tight end in NFL history to lead the league in receiving touchdowns and to reach 1,000 career postseason receiving yards.\nGronkowski is eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2027. He could be inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame as soon as 2026.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        To many NFL players, random drug tests from the league are an inconvenience that sometimes don't feel so random. To Denver Broncos linebacker Alex Singleton, it's something that he's glad happened to him. On Monday, Singleton publicly announced that the findings of an NFL drug test helped him learn that he had testicular cancer. Singleton said that the test revealed he had elevated levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin, which raised a red flag that something was wrong. From there, he made an appointment with a doctor, received his diagnosis and underwent surgery to remove the cancerous tumor this past Friday following the Broncos' Week 10 Thursday night victory over the Las Vegas Raiders.Singleton urged those reading his statement to listen to their bodies and get checked. He hopes to return to the field soon.\n\"This morning, I stood before our team as a lucky man. I shared with my teammates and coaches that I underwent successful surgery on Friday for testicular cancer after being diagnosed last week. Thankfully, we believe the cancer was caught early with a great prognosis for me and my family. While we are still awaiting some additional test results, I fully expect to return to the field in the coming weeks.A little over two weeks ago, following a random test as part of the NFL's Drug Testing Program, I received a notice that I had elevated levels of the hormone hCG in my system.Without a doubt, I knew with how diligent I am with what goes into my body that this was not from anything external I may have taken. After speaking with my agent and wife, we decided to book an appointment with a urologist. On Monday, I visited Dr. Andrew Zilavy who determined that, in fact, I had signs of a testicular tumor. I immediately contacted the Broncos, and they put me in contact with Dr. Geoff Ledgerwood, who was able to conduct an ultrasound immediately to confirm the diagnosis.And then Friday, after playing in the Raiders game the previous night, I underwent surgery to remove the cancerous tumor and begin the road to a full recovery. I wrestled with sharing such personal information publicly. But the fact is, if it helps one person decide to pay closer attention to their body, then it is well worth it.Early detection and regular screenings save lives and can save loved ones from a lot of grief. Heck, I have a wife, Sam, and daughter, Tallyn, along with an amazing family back in California.Not to mention, I'm a part of a great organization here with my Broncos family.\"The 31-year-old Singleton is in his fourth season with the Broncos, and has recorded 89 tackles and one sack through the first 10 games of the season. He played in all 60 of Denver's snaps in the 10-7 victory over the Raiders, the night before his surgery. Singleton began his career with the Philadelphia Eagles and put together two straight 120-tackle seasons before landing a one-year deal with Denver in 2022. Singleton turned in an impressive season in which he recorded 163 tackles, leading to his first big NFL extension the following year -- a three-year, $18 million deal. Singleton responded by racking up a career-high 177 tackles and two sacks in 2023. \nIt's unknown how much time Singleton is going to miss, but he said he has a \"great prognosis\" that could have him back on the field in the \"coming weeks.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas Tech coach Joey McGuire is standing on business when it comes to the Big 12 in the College Football Playoff picture and said one-loss BYU is worthy of merit in the discussion following Saturday's 29-7 win over the Cougars.Without mentioning Notre Dame by name, he skewered the Fighting Irish and their road to the postseason as an Independent.\"I have so much respect for BYU. I do,\" McGuire said after Saturday's win. \"I was really excited whenever they joined the Big 12 because I think that they carry a lot of weight and a lot of respect. I think that I have a lot of respect for them entering a conference and not playing an independent schedule like other people -- y'all already know who that is. \"So, I have a lot of respect for that. I mean, they're earning their right just like everybody, but a couple of people in the nation, are earning their right through conference play and playing in some really tough places.\"\n\n        \n            \n                A triumphant 72 hours in Lubbock: Inside Texas Tech's historic win against BYU, a moment 17 years in making\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs the new frontrunner in the Big 12, Texas Tech replaced BYU in this week's updated CBS Sports playoff bracket projection. The Cougars are expected to fall several spots in Tuesday's second rankings release from the selection committee, potentially behind two-loss Notre Dame.Should both teams win out the rest of the way, BYU would face off with the Red Raiders again in the Big 12 Championship Game while the Fighting Irish would await their fate.As it stands, the Cougars' lone win over a team inside the committee's top 25 is Utah. For Notre Dame, the recent victory over USC stands as its best during its seven-game winning streak, but another opportunity awaits this weekend at Pittsburgh.\nBYU concludes the regular season against TCU, Cincinnati and UCF, needing wins in all three games to reach the Big 12 title game.During Notre Dame's open week last month, coach Marcus Freeman was asked if he thought the Fighting Irish would ever join a power conference.\"The future of college athletics is always uncertain,\" Freeman said on Bussin' With The Boys. \"With private equity, with what's going to happen with these conferences, if there's a time that Notre Dame has to join a conference to ensure they can have the same opportunities to make the Playoff as everybody else, then I'm sure our administration would do it. \n\"Currently, the administration and myself and all of us feel confident that if we win the games we're supposed to win, we take care of the business we're supposed to take care of, we have just as good of a chance to make the playoffs as anybody else.\"To McGuire's point about Notre Dame playing an \"independent schedule,\" the Fighting Irish can play games against opponents without a tie to a major conference and with considerable flexibility. Under its current agreement with the ACC, the Irish must play five games per year against league opponents, but the school can schedule as many -- or few -- elite-level opponents as it wants.Since losing to nationally-ranked Miami and Texas A&M to open the season, Notre Dame has won seven straight games and is three wins from a 10-2 finish and probable invitation to the playoff for the second straight season.\nNotre Dame, despite losing to the Hurricanes, was ranked eight spots higher than Miami in the first playoff top 25 at No. 10.\"We had a lot of conversation, obviously, about Notre Dame,\" committee chair Mack Rhoades said last week. \"I think it starts with two losses, total of four points, against two very, very good teams. Obviously one of them ranked third in the country and one ranked 18th. We talked about I think early on defensively, maybe they weren't as good as what we thought they would be, but certainly most recent, it seems like they've been much, much better defensively.\"We think Notre Dame is a really -- when we look at the tape, we think Notre Dame is a really solid football team, both sides of the ball.\"\nThe Big 12's in danger of being a one-bid league with that honor going to its champion if the Big Ten and SEC gobble up most of the at-large spots along with Notre Dame. That would leave two auto-bids to the highest-ranked conference champions out of the ACC and American, most likely.BYU's current strength of record ranks No. 8 nationally, while Notre Dame is five spots lower. The Fighting Irish are ninth overall in game control and the Cougars are 21st -- two critical metrics in the voting process.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cleveland Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders served as the backup quarterback in the team's Week 10 loss to the New York Jets. It was Sanders' return to the active roster after battling a back injury that kept him sidelined in an Oct. 26 loss to the New England Patriots. Sanders was initially announced as the No. 2 option in October after Cleveland traded veteran Joe Flacco to the Cincinnati Bengals. Sanders will remain behind fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel on the depth chart -- for now, at least -- and ahead of veteran Bailey Zappe, who was active when Sanders was out. With Gabriel starting, Sanders has yet to receive any game action, even in garbage time.The Browns selected Sanders, who was the 2024 Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year while playing for his father, Deion, at Colorado, with the 144th overall pick in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. While Sanders has yet to make his regular season debut, he did get some run in the preseason as he battled for a spot on the depth chart. He impressed with two touchdowns and 138 yards through the air in his preseason debut. \nSanders was one of college football's most prolific passers during his time at Colorado. He guided the Buffaloes to a 9-4 record in 2024 while throwing for a career-high 4,134 yards on a 74% completion percentage. He also had 37 touchdowns passing, 15 of which went to Heisman Trophy winner and 2025 first-round pick Travis Hunter. When could Shedeur Sanders make his NFL debut?Sanders' position as No. 2 on the depth chart means that he's one play away from potentially taking significant reps for the Browns. Gabriel hasn't exactly lit the world on fire in his first five starts, either. He has eclipsed 200 yards passing just once -- and that was when he threw the ball 52 times in a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers -- and he's gone two out of the four games without a touchdown passing. His completion percentage in that span is also below 60% (58.6%) and he's averaging just 5.0 yards per attempt. \nCleveland has exceeded 20 points just once in Gabriel's five starts, a 31-6 win over the Miami Dolphins. The Browns are also 1-4 under his direction. Against the Jets on Sunday, Gabriel completed 17 of 32 passes for 167 yards and two touchdowns. He also had a career-high 54 yards rushing.Given that Cleveland (now 2-7) is in last in the AFC North and, as things stand, well out of contention for a wildcard playoff spot, the Browns could try and shake things up further by giving Sanders an opportunity to run the offense at some point. At the very least, it would allow the franchise to accurately evaluate Sanders' future in the league and potential with the team. In a press conference on Monday, coach Kevin Stefanski was asked about when Sanders might get a chance to start and declined to say anything either way about the status of his young QBs. \n\"I don't think it's fair to speculate,\" Stefanski said. \"We're committed to getting better as an offense. Dillon is certainly committed to improving every which way he can, and all the while all of our players -- young players -- are developing and working so hard behind the scenes to make sure that they're getting better on a daily basis.\"Browns fans are, unsurprisingly, growing impatient with Gabriel's struggles, and even though he threw two touchdowns on Sunday, a loss to the hapless Jets only furthers the frustration from the Cleveland faithful. Whether Sanders is an upgrade or not, Browns fans are being given little reason to believe Gabriel is the answer and want to at least find out what the Colorado product could do. Stefanski won't comment firmly on if or when that could happen, but the questions won't stop any time soon. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants fired coach Brian Daboll on Monday, following a 24-20 loss to the Chicago Bears in Week 10. It marked the fourth time this season the Giants blew a double-digit lead, and the loss knocked New York down to 2-8 -- bad enough for last place in the NFC East. Daboll went 20-40-1 during his four seasons as lead man. Now, the Giants will again take a spin on the coaching carousel. With Daboll out, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports that Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka will take over as interim coach. Kafka was hired away from the Kansas City Chiefs when Daboll landed the Giants job in 2022. This offensive-minded duo got off to a hot start by going 9-7-1 and winning a playoff game in their first season together, but the Giants then regressed from that point for multiple reasons.Who is Mike Kafka, and what has the 38-year-old former quarterback been through in his career? Let's take a look at the man who is auditioning to be the Giants' new lead man.A Chicago kidIt's ironic that a loss to the Bears ultimately led to a promotion for Kafka, as he was born in the \"Windy City,\" went to St. Rita on the Southwest Side and played his college football at Northwestern. \nAs a senior, Kafka was statistically one of the best quarterbacks in the Big Ten, as he completed 319 of 492 passes (64.8%) for 3,430 yards, 16 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. In the 2010 Outback Bowl vs. Auburn, which the Wildcats lost in overtime, 38-35, Kafka completed 47 of 78 passes for 532 yards, four touchdowns, five interceptions and rushed 20 times for 34 yards and a touchdown. There are no typos in that statline, Kafka actually attempted 78 passes and scored five touchdowns with five turnovers. His 4,265 career passing yards still rank No. 11 in Northwestern history. A fourth-round pick of the Philadelphia EaglesKafka was selected by the Eagles with the No. 122 overall pick in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was the fifth quarterback taken behind Sam Bradford, Tim Tebow, Jimmy Clausen and Colt McCoy. Philly is where Kafka became acquainted with Andy Reid. As a rookie, he was the third quarterback behind Michael Vick and Kevin Kolb.\n        \n            \n                Brian Daboll fired: Giants coaching candidates, plus one big name already ruled out\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKafka appeared in just four NFL games with zero starts for the Eagles, all of which came in his second NFL season, and completed 11 of 16 passes for 107 yards and two interceptions. After being released in 2012, Kafka had brief stops with several different organizations, such as the New England Patriots, Jacksonville Jaguars and Minnesota Vikings before turning his attention to coaching in 2016.\nKafka the coachKafka returned to Northwestern to begin his coaching career as an offensive grad assistant, but after just one year, coach Reid came calling to bring Kafka on as an offensive quality control coach with the Chiefs. Kafka then began to work his way up the ladder, serving as Kansas City's quarterbacks coach for three seasons, and added on the title of passing game coordinator for his final two years in Kansas City. With the Chiefs, Kafka saw one of the best quarterbacks of all time develop in Patrick Mahomes, and won Super Bowl LIV, which was the first of this new Chiefs' dynasty. Head coach in waiting?Despite Daboll being a former offensive play-caller with the Buffalo Bills, Kafka shared play-calling duties during his four seasons in New York. Daboll actually announced that Kafka would be the play caller for the 2025 season. \nNaturally what the Giants have accomplished -- or failed to accomplish during Kafka's time in New York is not impressive, but that hasn't stopped Kafka from receiving head coach interest. Over the past few years, Kafka has interviewed for several head coaching jobs, including with the Carolina Panthers, Tennessee Titans, Seattle Seahawks, Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts. Just this past cycle, Kafka interviewed for the New Orleans Saints and Bears' head coaching jobs, and was selected to be a head coach for the 2025 Senior Bowl. Kafka will likely continue to receive head coach interest moving forward, and the next eight weeks will be his most important job interview yet. The \"Kafka era\" kicks off this Sunday, when the Giants host Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers at MefLife Stadium. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        When Trey McKenney committed to Michigan last November, he provided new Wolverines coach Dusty May with a big win for several reasons. First, just five days after his first game coaching the maize and blue, May had secured the services of a player whose recruitment had begun under the program's previous coach, Juwan Howard. Second, he had added an in-state product, with McKenney hailing from Flint, just an hour north of Michigan's campus in Ann Arbor.Third, and most importantly, May landed a player who can contribute to Michigan right away. McKenney, the 21st-ranked player in 247Sport's 2025 high school recruiting class, is the Wolverines' third-best high school commit in the 247Sports era (since 2000), behind only Caleb Houstan and Moussa Diabate.McKenney was a two-time Michigan Gatorade Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American and a key part of Team USA's gold medal-winning squad at the FIBA U18 AmeriCup.Plus, he's adding to a family heritage that runs deep in Flint. His aunt, Linnell Jones-McKenney, was an All-America basketball player at Kentucky State University and is a member of the school's Hall of Fame, the Greater Flint Area Hall of Fame and the Greater Flint African American Hall of Fame. She made Team USA's 1980 Olympic women's basketball team, though the US ultimately boycotted the Games. Regarded as the first professional women's basketball player from Flint, she played in the Women's Professional Basketball League and then in Europe.\nFurthermore, McKenney's grandfather, Woodrow Stanley, was the mayor of Flint from 1991-2002.\"Being from Flint means a lot,\" McKenney said. \"It's really shaped who I am today and the way I approach every day with my work and go about stuff in the classroom and just life in general. I'm close with a lot of the guys from Flint who have made it, like Miles [Bridges], Mateen Cleaves. They always try to give me some tips and some pointers to give back, try to help me, because that's where I want to be one day.\"At 6-4 and 225 pounds, McKenney is a \"unique backcourt match-up\" who's \"powerful, physical, crafty, has a great left-hand, and is also very adept at scoring over top of contesting defenders in the mid-range area,\" 247Sports director of scouting Adam Finkelstein wrote in his scouting report.\nMcKenney joins a Michigan team with high hopes. Buoyed by 247Sports' second-ranking transfer class, featuring top overall transfer Yaxel Lendeborg, as well as a solid returning core, the Wolverines are +1900 to win the national championship at FanDuel Sportsbook, tied for the seventh-shortest odds in the country.The No. 6 Wolverines face Wake Forest on Tuesday and opening their season with a 121-78 win over Oakland on Friday, with McKenney coming off the bench to score 21 points on 7-for-10 shooting, including 6 for 8 from 3-point range. Ahead of his debut, McKenney sat down with CBS Sports to discuss several aspects of his basketball career, past, present and yet to come.\nNOTE: This interview has been edited for clarity.CBS Sports: What's your earliest memory realizing you can be a good basketball player?\nTrey McKenney: \"Really, during COVID, when everybody was in lockdown, I just kept trying to perfect my cap and keep working at it, and I just progressively got better every year. So I think during COVID I tried to really work hard, because I knew people were gonna stop working.\"CBS: What did that look like? Obviously a lot of gyms were closed. How you'd you make that work?TM: \"There was actually a gym that I had to use during COVID, so I would go up there and get shots up and stuff with my dad. But, you know, everybody didn't have a gym to go to during COVID, so I definitely had to take advantage of that.\"\nCBS: What are the biggest differences you've noticed between high school and college, whether it's on the court or off the court? TM: \"Practice. It's very intense, and every second, it means something. Time is very precious in college. And, really, I think my routine has really stuck out. I think really trying to build a routine and have a foundation for what I'm doing every day has really helped me.\"CBS: Have you always been a routine-based guy, or is that something you realized you had to have when you got to Michigan?\nTM: \"No, I think I've been like that since high school. I think I've always prioritized getting better every day and having a routine that just helps map it out and make everything easier.\"CBS: What are some things you've focused on these first few months at Michigan, and what progress have you seen in those areas?TM: \"I'm really just trying to improve my shot off the catch and [my movement] without the ball. I think being able to move without the ball and being effective off the ball can help me get inside, use my body and stuff like that. I really think off the ball, my shooting, it's taken a leap from the summer and some of the fall.\"\nCBS: What did Dusty May do to win you over after your recruiting started under the previous staff?TM: \"Really, they just spent a lot of time with me throughout when they first got a job., One day, when college coaches could come see you at your high school, they were literally there the whole day. It just meant a lot to spend time with them, and he's a real genuine person, down to Earth. I had a relationship with him, and, ultimately, trust is what builds relationships in this game, so I think that really helped me, and that really won me over with him, for sure.\"CBS: What's your relationship like with your aunt? She could really play.TM: \"One of my first basketball memories was me going to one of her camps when I was little little, so she's definitely had an influence on me and an influence on me even picking up the basketball to begin with.\"\nCBS: Any early impressions of your teammates so far? Anyone who you think is going to have a strong season?TM: \"[UCLA transfer] Aday Mara. He's really surprised me a lot. He's like 7-3, and he can move. He can pass the ball like a point guard. So, I mean, he's really surprised me.\"CBS: What are your goals for this year?TM: \"We have a really talented team this year and a lot of guys that can play a lot of different spots on the court. We just have a really egoless team that wants to see the next man succeed, so anything less than a national championship for us, man ... That's definitely been the goal ever since we stepped into the gym in the summer, and, you know, Final Four, we want to be there on the last Monday. Ultimately for me, I just want to prove that I'm one of the best freshmen in the country, impact-wise, offensively and defensively.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's the end of the line for Brian Daboll in New York. In the wake of another fourth-quarter collapse, this time blowing a 10-point fourth-quarter lead to the Bears in Week 10, the New York Giants have fired the head coach. This ends a turbulent tenure for Daboll and the Giants, owning a 20-40-1 regular-season record, which includes their 2-8 campaign in 2025. With Daboll shown the door, the next question is who'll replace him. Offensive coordinator Mike Kafka will serve as the interim head coach, but a larger search is upcoming this offseason. If you are hoping that it could be current Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin, however, you might not want to get your hopes up. Given the emergence of rookie sensation Jaxson Dart as a franchise cornerstone at quarterback, folks have drawn the logical line to giving Kiffin a call to see if he'd want to reunite with his former quarterback and return to the NFL. While it makes sense on paper, judging by what Brandon Dart, Jaxson's father, had to say about that possible reunion, it doesn't sound like a realistic option. \n\"As we were texting on our Kiffin-Dart family text thread, because I think Boomer Esiason had said something in the media today that maybe they should throw out a potential coaching (offer) to Kiffin, and he just sent it over with a smirk and just said, 'It's too cold in New York for me.' It's just kind of funny,\" Brandon Dart recently told the \"Bleav in Ole Miss\" podcast, via the New York Post. \"But we have our weekly interactions with him and his family, and Jaxson holds high regard. I think Kiffin is one of his most trusted allies, and I think he uses him for advice in a lot of different ways, so there's constant communication between them, even today, and there's a lot of that between our families. I don't think we could have asked for a more special coach relationship between our family and our son, so we're very, very grateful for coach Kiff.\"\nKiffin coached Dart for three years at Ole Miss, which included a stellar senior season in 2024 with the quarterback throwing for 4,279 yards and 29 touchdowns while completing 69.3% of his throws. That tutelage helped him become a first-round pick at the 2025 NFL Draft, and, given the close ties they share, it would make sense for New York to see if he'd be interested in the job. \nWhile weather might be a factor for Kiffin, so is the current landscape in college football. There are a number of high-profile jobs open, including at LSU, Penn State, and Florida, where he could be a leading candidate. He could also simply stay put at Ole Miss, where he currently has the Rebels in contention for the College Football Playoff. If that proves to be the case and Kiffin isn't an option for New York, let's highlight three other possible options. Jesse MinterCurrent role: Defensive coordinator, Los Angeles ChargersOwnership and fans alike may want an offensive-minded head coach to further cater to Dart's development, but don't sleep on a guy like Jesse Minter, either. New York has invested heavily along the defensive line by acquiring the likes of Brian Burns, signing Dexter Lawrence to a big-money extension, and drafting Abdul Carter and Kayvon Thibodeaux inside the top five of the NFL Draft in recent years. That unit has the potential to be among the best in the NFL, and could reach that with someone like Minter at the helm, which would, in turn, help Dart and the offense. \nMinter, who was the defensive coordinator at the University of Michigan and followed Jim Harbaugh to the Los Angeles Chargers in the same role, has presided over some dominant defenses. In 2024, the Chargers ranked No. 1 in points allowed and are No. 6 in the league in yards allowed in 2025 (entering Week 10). Kliff KingsburyCurrent role: Offensive coordinator, Washington CommandersLast offseason, we saw former Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson accept a head coaching job in the division with Chicago, so maybe Kingsbury could be the latest to follow that track. Kingsbury has done wonders for the Commanders offense with a young Jayden Daniels, and could bring a similar boost to Dart's development in New York. On top of being one of the top offensive minds in the NFL, he also comes with prior head coaching experience, leading the Arizona Cardinals from 2019 to 2022. Kingsbury went just 28-37-1 over that tenure, but it did include an 11-6 record in 2021. Klint KubiakCurrent role: Offensive coordinator, Seattle SeahawksKubiak is expected to be a popular name this upcoming hiring cycle, especially after he has turned the Seattle Seahawks offense into one of the best in the league. Entering Week 10, Sam Darnold is playing at an MVP level and averaging 9.6 yards per attempt. Meanwhile, Jaxon Smith-Njigba currently leads the NFL with 948 yards receiving and is on pace to be the league's first 2,000-yard receiver. Could he work similar magic with Dart and a healthy Malik Nabers with the Giants?\nRobert SalehCurrent role: Defensive coordinator, San Francisco 49ersDon't sleep on Saleh, who should be a familiar face to the region after serving as he head coach of the New York Jets from 2021 up until early October of last season. He could get another kick at the can as an NFL head coach, and recently showered Jaxson Dart with praise, calling the rookie \"uber-talented\" leading up to their Week 9 matchup. Saleh even spoke with Dart following the contest, per ESPN's Jordan Raanan, further signaling his affinity for the young quarterback. Saleh's demise with the Jets was the team's inability to get it right at quarterback. The Giants already have their guy, so Saleh could make sense, especially leading an emerging defense. Steve SpagnuoloCurrent role: Defensive coordinator, Kansas City ChiefsSpags is a very familiar figure for the New York Giants. Already, he's had two stints with the organization, with the latest seeing him serve as the interim head coach in 2017. Since then, he's been with the Chiefs and emboldened his reputation as arguably the best defensive coordinator in the NFL. As we've noted, the development of Dart is paramount, but New York also has fantastic pieces on defense that Spagnuolo could certainly get the most out of. With the right offensive coordinator, this reunion could make some sense if Spagnuolo feels he's done all he can do with Kansas City. Bill BelichickCurrent role: Head coach, University of North CarolinaIt's the GOAT-sized elephant in the room. It's no secret that Belichick holds the New York Giants in high regard. He worked as an assistant coach and defensive guru with the organization from 1979 all the way through the 1990 season, helping the Giants to two Super Bowl championships. He remains close with the Mara family, so we can't rule out this reunion entirely. Of course, Belichick would need to trigger his $1 million opt-out clause with UNC to pave the way for a return to New York, and would need to have that job secured before making such a move. If he wants back into the NFL, this is an ideal storybook way to do so, but do the Giants want to hire a Belichick, who turns 74 in April? That's the question. \n            ",

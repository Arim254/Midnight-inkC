The Tide are coming off their best offensive performance of the season, scoring their most points (34) on the road when they defeated Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff first round, and that was against an Oklahoma defense which ranks No. 8 in the nation in points allowed per game.The Over is 5-2 for Indiana over its last seven, and it's 8-5 overall for the season. The Hoosiers have the No. 4 scoring offense in the country as Mendoza is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns, while IU's ground game piles up nearly 150 yards. Bama's Ty Simpson is expected to keep pace, with him actually throwing for more yards than the Heisman winner.

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 18 could be considerably lucrative for players with incentive-based contracts, including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, Aaron Rodgers of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers standout Keenan Allen.Darnold could hit a $1 million jackpot with three touchdown passes and 150 yards passing against the San Francisco 49ers in a battle for the NFC West. Darnold has 3,850 yards through the air and 25 touchdowns with notable escalators in his contract.Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle is active for the finale against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which means he cashes a $1 million bonus. He could tack on another $250,000 to that with a touchdown. For the Buccaneers, wideout Sterling Shepard needs one reception for $125,000 and just 29 receiving yards for an additional $125,000.Rodgers' one-year deal with the Steelers is laced with incentives to a total of $5.85 million if he hits them all. Only one of those — make the playoffs — can be accomplished this weekend with a win.\nRodgers makes $500,000 if the Steelers beat the Baltimore Ravens to win the AFC North. Among other incentives, Rodgers take homes $600,000 if the Steelers win a wild-card game and he plays at least 50% of the offensive snaps and another $1 million should Pittsburgh win the AFC Championship.NFL's Week 18 incentive notablesPotential total earningsNeedHow it happensKeenan Allen, Chargers$1.25 million6 catches; 9+ yards; 2 TDsImpressive statsRico Dowdle, Panthers$1.25 millionActive; TDPlay and scoreSam Darnold, Seahawks$1 million3 passing TD; 150 yardsUsual effortAaron Rodgers, Steelers$500,000WinBeat Baltimore Tony Pollard, Titans$500,00066 rushing yards; 2 TDsBest season avg.Dawson Knox, Bills$500,0007+ yards; TDFind red zone TDSaquon Barkley, Eagles$500,00087 scrimmage yardsHeavy touchesCaleb Williams, BearsFuture max270 yards for 4,000Explosive playsFor Allen, there's a $1.25 million bonus on the line against the Denver Broncos. Six catches would give him a $750,000 check, while nine or more yards receiving and two touchdowns would net him another $500,000. Allen has 74 receptions for 741 yards and four scores this fall.For 49ers wideout Jauan Jennings, a seven-reception game would give him a $666,666 bonus. Washington Commanders playmaker Deebo Samuel could get to $1.5 million with at least 10 catches, 93 yards receiving and two touchdowns to hit everything.Commanders pass rusher Von Miller needs one sack of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts to hit a $1 million bonus.New England Patriots tight end Hunter Henry could pocket a $250,000 incentive with five catches against the Miami Dolphins. And Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, the MVP frontrunner, is expected to play.While there's no contract language in the form of a bonus for Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams, the former No. 1 overall pick looks to become the franchise's first 4,000-yard passer. That would push the second-year pro closer to a max deal when the times comes. Williams needs 109 yards against the Detroit Lions to break Erik Kramer's team record of 3,838 set in 1995 and 270 yards to eclipse 4,000.\"For me, it would be cool just in the sense there's never been one here,\" Williams said. \"I was brought here for those types of things and those types of moments, the things that haven't been done here, to try and be able to accomplish. But the self-goals and all of that always get swept under when you go for team goals and that's winning ballgames. That's first and foremost on my mind. That's first and foremost for this team because the most important thing is winning ballgames and heading into the playoffs with some momentum and some good energy.\"And in another milestone department, 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is 110 receiving yards away from hitting the 1,000-yard mark in both rushing and receiving this season, which would mark the second time that's happened in his NFL career.Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett needs one sack to set NFL record and he gets his opportunity against one of the NFL's weakest offensive fronts.\n            ",

Top-ranked and unbeaten Indiana's showdown with Alabama in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals appears set to be a wet one.Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected throughout the morning in Pasadena, California followed by fewer showers in the afternoon during the game, according to AccuWeather. Thursday's high in 64 degrees and Pasadena's Rose Parade was under a flood watch through noon local time.Rain is expected to stop around 1 p.m. local time for a brief period, but there is a 50% chance for more precipitation thereafter during the first half of the Rose Bowl through 6 p.m.Heavy rains Thursday morning forced organizers to tarp the field inside the Rose Bowl as working crews rushed to move standing water off the playing surface by pushing it toward the stands.\n\"You know, if it's a deluge, that's one thing. I don't expect that tomorrow, and I don't expect it to be a real critical factor in the game, and I don't see it changing our game plan very much,\" Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said at his final press conference ahead of the contest.For Alabama, the game plan will not change unless there are heavier rains.\"I think you just gotta see what it is in the moment,\" Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said. \"You know, it could be heavy at times. I don't know. It could be light. You just have to adjust. For us, we haven't played a lot in those elements this season. You try to prepare in practice with a wet ball and things like that, whether it's snapping the football, catching the football, throwing it, whatever it is. \n\"But in the end, you've just got to adapt, and we talked about those things on the staff, whether it's offense or defense, it kind of affects how you go about.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe fourth and final game of the College Football Playoff quarterfinal round sees two SEC rivals square off for the second time this season with Ole Miss taking on Georgia in the Sugar Bowl Thursday night. The winner of this matchup faces Miami in the CFP semifinal with a trip to the championship game on the line. The last time Georgia and Ole Miss faced one another, it appeared the Rebels were on their way to a big win. However, a 17-0 fourth-quarter run by the Bulldogs gave Georgia the win and handed Ole Miss its only loss of the season to date. The Bulldogs would also lose just one game this year, and they wound up winning the SEC Championship. Both teams have a slightly different look right now, with Georgia really clicking on both sides of the ball over the last two months while Ole Miss has a new head coach. Lane Kiffin left the Rebels for rival LSU after the regular season ended, and he wasn't allowed to coach Ole Miss in the CFP. Instead, the Rebels are now led by Pete Golding, formerly the program's defensive coordinator. He kicked off his head coaching tenure with a blowout win over Tulane in the CFP's first round, while Georgia enjoyed a first-round bye. Kickoff from the Caesars Superdome is set for 8 p.m. ET on New Year's Day. The Bulldogs are 6.5-point favorites in the latest SportsLine consensus Ole Miss vs. Georgia odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 55.5. Georgia is a -240 money line favorite (bet $240 to win $100), while the Rebels are +197 underdogs (wager $100 to win $197). Before you make any Ole Miss vs. Georgia picks of your own, make sure you see the top college football picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college football game 10,000 times.\nWhere to watch Ole Miss vs. Georgia on ThursdayWhen: Thursday, Jan. 1Time: 8 p.m. ETTV: ESPNStream: Fubo  Follow along: CBS Sports AppOle Miss vs. Georgia betting previewOdds: Georgia -6.5, Over/Under 55.5\nA lot of focus entering the CFP was on the Big Ten given Indiana is the No. 1 seed in the field and Ohio State won it all last year, though the Buckeyes lost Wednesday night to Miami, meaning the winner of Ole Miss-Georgia faces the Hurricanes in the next round. There's a strong case that Georgia -- not any Big Ten team -- is the most dangerous team in the field. The team's offense has been dynamic and efficient behind first-year starting quarterback Gunner Stockton, who finished seventh in Heisman Trophy voting with a 70.7% completion rate and 23 touchdowns to five picks. Stockton is also coming off maybe his best overall performance of his career as he completed 20 of his 26 passing attempts with three touchdowns against Alabama in the SEC title game a few weeks ago. Georgia also finished the year ninth in scoring defense at 15.9 points per game after allowing 35 to Ole Miss and 41 to Tennessee earlier in 2025.The Rebels kicked off the Pete Golding era in resounding fashion, dominating Tulane 41-10 in the CFP's first round for Ole Miss' second win over the Green Wave this year. It was expected Ole Miss would win that game and win rather thoroughly, but this matchup with Georgia is Golding's first major test as the Rebels' head coach. Ole Miss' offense has been incredibly dynamic over the years when Kiffin was the head coach and calling plays, and that side of the ball scored 35 against Georgia's elite defense. But with Kiffin gone and many of the current Ole Miss offensive staff members soon to depart for LSU, how will that side of the ball look? Golding's defense found a groove in the second half of the year after some high-scoring affairs in September and October, so quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and Co. will have more pressure on them if the Rebels want to pull off the upset.Despite the 12-1 record, Georgia is just 6-7 against the spread this year. Ole Miss is also 12-1 and is better ATS at 8-5. Both teams have played more games that finished Under the total as opposed to Over, with eight of Georgia's 13 games finishing Under and seven of Ole Miss' 13 doing the same. An Under finish may be in play here as the total is very high at 55.5, per the latest SportsLine consensus odds.Model's Ole Miss vs. Georgia score prediction, picksThe Bulldogs win in the majority of the SportsLine Projection Model's 10,000 simulations, but the model instead would rather back the Rebels as they win in 44% of simulations at plus money while also covering the 6.5-point spread nearly 60% of the time. The model also has the Over on 55.5 hitting in 51% of simulations despite both teams leaning Under this season. Four of Ole Miss' last five games have finished Under, and each of Georgia's last four games have also gone Under the total.Ole Miss vs. Georgia score prediction: Georgia 30, Ole Miss 27Want more college football picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Ole Miss vs. Georgia.

Olave was hospitalized for the issue, but he is expected to be discharged today, Underhill reports.Olave missed New Orleans' Wednesday practice with an illness. He has no history of blood clots and is expected to make a full recovery within a month, ESPN reported.Olave, 25, finishes the season with 100 catches for 1,163 yards and nine touchdowns, all career highs. This came just one year after he played in just eight games due to multiple concussions and he contemplated retirement. Before developing the blood clot, Olave said it was one of his goals to play all 17 games this season.\n\"I think it's going to be my first time in my NFL career playing 17,\" Olave said Sunday, via ESPN. \"It means a lot, man. One of my goals, one of my main goals for this year is trying to play all 17. Playing through injuries, playing through all that. So I'm super grateful, like I said. Got to give all glory to God to be in this position. We just got to finish next week.\"Even though he will not achieve that goal, it was a terrific year for the 2022 first-round pick out of Ohio State. He was the top target for rookie quarterback Tyler Shough and had 18 catches for 267 yards and three touchdowns in the past two weeks alone.\nThough both New Orleans and Atlanta are out of the playoff picture, the game could have significant ramifications. If the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay still needs a Saints victory Sunday to go to the playoffs. If Carolina loses, it would still make the playoffs if the Falcons win.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nAll of your Week 18 NFL picks will come on divisional contests as the league moved to this scheduling format a few years ago. Many of these matchups carry meaning for playoff seeding such as Panthers vs. Buccaneers (-2.5) and Seahawks vs. 49ers (+1.5) on Saturday, plus Broncos vs. Chargers (+12.5) and Ravens vs. Steelers (+3.5) on Sunday. Then there are games to make Week 18 NFL predictions on where one team is fighting for seeding while the other has already been eliminated from postseason contention. Some of these include Texans vs. Colts (+10.5) and Patriots vs. Dolphins (+10.5).Motivation and incentive shouldn't be overlooked with your NFL best bets and when scouring the latest Week 18 NFL odds. The largest of the NFL spreads has Jacksonville as 12.5-point favorites over the Titans as the Jags could still land the No. 2 seed in the AFC. Meanwhile, one of the slimmest lines has the Bears favored by 3 points over Detroit as Chicago can clinch the No. 2 seed with a win. All of the updated Week 18 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 18 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 18 on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 18 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 18 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 18 NFL picks is that the Packers (+6.5, 36.5) cover at Minnesota on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET. Green Bay is locked into the No. 7 seed and could rest its starters, including a banged-up Jordan Love, but it should still have enough to stay within a touchdown versus an imbalanced Vikings team. Minnesota had 3 passing yards in its Christmas win over Detroit, which is the fewest by any team in a win in 19 years. The Vikings rank 29th in total offense, 30th in turnover differential and dead last in giveaways. Also, since Matt LaFleur became coach in 2019, Green Bay owns the NFL's third best spread record (19-10) as a road underdog. The model has Green Bay prevailing versus the spread nearly 70% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Packers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 18 NFL predictions: the Jaguars (-12.5, 47.5) cover versus the Titans in over 50% of simulations in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. The Jags have won seven straight, can wrap up the division with a Week 18 win, and have a shot at the AFC's No. 1 seed if they get some help. So, motivation won't be a question for Jacksonville, which is 6-1 straight up and 5-2 ATS over its last seven matchups versus Tennessee. The Jaguars also boast the league's best home spread record (6-1) in 2025, while the Titans are one of two teams to rank in the bottom five in both scoring offense and scoring defense. SportsLine's model predicts Jacksonville to cover, as well as the over hitting 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Jags to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 18 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 18 NFL schedule and just revealed six teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines.

    "body": "\n        No. 3 Georgia will seek redemption in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday, when it takes on No. 6 Ole Miss inside the Superdome in New Orleans. The Bulldogs were in an identical situation a year ago in the College Football Playoff semifinal when they were eliminated by a surging Notre Dame team that finished as the national runner up.Back then, UGA was relying on unproven quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was making his first career start in a high-stakes showdown against one of the nation's best defenses. This time around, Stockton is a seasoned veteran who emerged as one of the nation's top QBs while guiding the Bulldogs to an SEC championship.On the other side, Ole Miss will also be seeking some redemption after the Rebels lost 43-35 at Georgia on Oct. 18. Head coach Lane Kiffin has since departed for LSU, leaving Ole Miss in the care of new coach Pete Golding for the program's first-ever CFP appearance.Despite the strangely timed coaching transition, the Rebels looked strong in a 41-10 first-round beatdown of Tulane. With star quarterback Trinidad Chambliss spearheading a dynamic offense, Ole Miss remains a force to be reckoned with.\nGeorgia is entering off a bye, but the Bulldogs were dominant in a 28-7 SEC title game win over Alabama. The UGA defense has gone four straight games without allowing more than 10 points.Georgia vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Sugar BowlKewan Lacy's status: The top injury-related storyline entering the Sugar Bowl appears to be the health of Ole Miss star running back Kewan Lacy. The Missouri transfer exited the Rebels' first-round win over Tulane in the third quarter with an apparent shoulder injury. Though he returned, he appeared to be less than 100%, which has cast his status for the quarterfinals into doubt. Lacy is second nationally among all players with 21 rushing touchdowns. Though he tallied just 31 yards rushing on 12 carries in the Rebels' October loss at Georgia, he did score two touchdowns against the Bulldogs.The last meeting: Georgia scored on every offensive possession against Ole Miss in its 43-35 win over the Rebels on Oct. 18 until it was time to take a knee. It was an unbelievable performance from the UGA offense and quarterback Gunner Stockton. But that doesn't mean the victory came easy for the Bulldogs. Ole Miss proved unstoppable for three quarters and took a 35-26 lead into the fourth inside Sanford Stadium. Finally, when the game was on the line, Georgia's defense stepped up and came up with critical stops to hand Ole Miss its only loss of the season.\nNew coaching rivalry: Add another chapter to college football's long-running saga of former Nick Saban assistants coaching against each other. Georgia coach Kirby Smart and new Ole Miss coach Pete Golding each share the distinction of being former Alabama defensive coordinators who are now running their own SEC programs. Smart is the most-accomplished branch of the Saban tree, whereas Golding is just one game into his head coaching career and has a lot to prove. While they didn't overlap at Alabama, they learned under the same teacher, and both helped the Crimson Tide win national titles.  Where to watch Georgia vs. Ole Miss live  Date: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 8 p.m. ET  Location: Caesars Superdome -- New Orleans, Louisiana  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Georgia vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks  \nSince giving up 35 points against Ole Miss in a 43-35 home victory over the Rebels on Oct. 18, Georgia has grown into one of college football's premier defensive outfits. The Bulldogs' last four opponents have averaged a paltry 7.25 points per game as coordinator Glenn Schumann's unit has developed the teeth needed to make UGA a legitimate national championship contender. It's hard to imagine Ole Miss playing as perfectly offensively as it did through the first three quarters of the first meeting. Look for Georgia's defense to come up with enough key stops to help Georgia pull away and reach the semifinals. Pick: Georgia -6.5\n\n                    \n    \n

    "body": "\n        When the calendar flipped from 2024 to 2025, neither of the teams that ultimately played in the national championship game were ranked in the top-five of the AP Top 25 poll. Florida began the new year at No. 6, and Houston started the new year at No. 14.That they ended up being the last two teams standings inside the Alamodome on April 7 shows that the saying, \"new year, new me\" can apply to college basketball teams. As 2026 arrives, so does the heart of conference play and a line in the sand.Didn't accomplish what you wanted to in November and December? January and February bring a shot for redemption. Houston started slow a year ago before ratcheting up the intensity with the start of Big 12 play to go 19-1. It's almost as if the Cougars resolved anew to be the nastiest, grittiest team in college basketball.\n        \n            \n                Top 25 college basketball stories of 2025, ranked: Florida wins title; Duke, Cooper Flagg fall in Final Four\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAgainst that backdrop, we are setting out to make New Year's resolutions on behalf of some of college basketball's 2025-26 contenders for this week's Dribble Handoff.\nKansas: Keep being patient with Darryn PetersonI hope Peterson plays Saturday for the first time in three weeks; I gather that's the plan. Either way, my hope is that everybody can find a way to stay reasonable even if the five-star freshman misses what would be his 10th game of the season at UCF, because, as I've said many times on recent episodes of the Eye On College Basketball Podcast, some of the hysteria connected to Peterson's absence has seemed a little overblown, at least from my perspective.Has it been frustrating for KU fans? Certainly. Has it been frustrating for KU coach Bill Self? How could it not be? But here's the truth: basketball players missing multiple weeks, or even multiple months, with injuries and issues like the injuries and issues Peterson has reportedly been dealing with isn't all too uncommon in the NBA, nor is a player, or his family/advisors, having a say in any plan for a return to the court. From that perspective, all of this has been more normal than it might appear to some. But, yes, it would be awesome if it were a big college basketball story that soon becomes an old college basketball story, because we're only going to get one year of Peterson in the Big 12, and it would be a shame if the memories from it were mostly tied to the possible No. 1 overall pick of the 2026 NBA Draft sitting on a bench in street clothes watching a season unfold without him . -- Gary ParrishTennessee: Give Nate Ament a full-time green lightAs this 2025-26 freshman class has grown into maybe the strongest in the sport's history, one top-10 prospect has drifted into the background a bit. Nate Ament has been productive (15.4 ppg, 6.9 rpg) but hasn't been in that upper-echelon conversation with the likes of Cam Boozer, AJ Dybantsa, Darryn Peterson, Darius Acuff Jr., Mikel Brown Jr. and even Kingston Flemings. \nI do think Ament could have a stronger second half of the season vs. what we saw in November and December. His shooting splits have to improve, and while Ja'Kobi Gillespie running the point is going to be UT's most important factor in pushing for the top of the SEC, Ament displaying his array of offensive skills will be nearly as necessary if the Vols are going to be a 4-seed or better for a fifth straight season. I think this is the SEC team with the widest gap between ceiling and floor. The 10-3 Volunteers open up league play this weekend at Arkansas, a spicy test to get January going. Rick Barnes' team has two high-quality wins (vs. Houston in Las Vegas in November, home against Louisville in December), with losses to Kansas, Syracuse and Illinois also on the docket. Ament hasn't been his best against the best teams. Time for him to level up, and time for Barnes to scheme up his best talent, because we'll be seeing the same elsewhere in that league at schools like Arkansas, Kentucky, Alabama and Auburn. -- Matt NorlanderFlorida: Stay in the gym until shooting improvesAmong the more perplexing early-season developments is defending national champion Florida's inability to shoot at even a Division I average from 3-point range. It is shooting 6.8% below the Division I average on above-the-break 3-pointers per CBB Analytics data, which last season was one of its many strengths. And its 3-point shooting percentage amid a 9-4 start is 28.2%. That ranks 340th among 344 teams. That is abysmal for a Gators team that ranked No. 3 in the preseason and was fifth nationally in scoring per game just a season ago. \n\n                                                                    Credit via CBB Analytics data\n                                                            The Gators have a roster worth millions of dollars and the staff targeted players who'd previously shot it well -- among them Boogie Fland and Xaivian Lee -- but the numbers thus far have been ugly. Fland is shooting 22.2% on 3-pointers and Lee is at 25.3%. And even returning players who previously shot it well from distance like Alex Condon and Thomas Haugh are below their percentages from last season. It's been ugly all the way around. Florida as a team should make a resolution to hold an open gym and lock its doors until this improves. There are bubbling reasons why it has not perhaps been better -- the guard play has been inconsistent, turnovers have been an issue and depth (or lack thereof) is a problem. But it's almost inexplicable that this team is not only the worst among all SEC teams in 3-point percentage -- but also the worst among all major conference teams in 3-point percentage. That has to improve, and dramatically, before Florida can even begin to start daydreaming about a repeat. -- Kyle BooneKentucky: Shoot fewer 3-pointersKentucky is 2-1 against high-major opponents when shooting 16 or fewer 3-pointers and 0-3 against high-major opponents when shooting 30 or more 3-pointers. For this UK team, less is more when it comes to outside shooting. In theory, Kam Williams, Jasper Johnson, Collin Chandler and Trent Noah were meant to comprise a solid nucleus of perimeter marksmen. In practice, they are role players who have struggled mightily to find anything resembling a rhythm against quality opponents. UK is at its best when playing in transition, attacking the basket and crashing the glass. \nSecond-year coach Mark Pope is tactically brilliant and might prefer an artful style built around a bunch of 40% 3-point shooters. But he needs to acknowledge this Kentucky team won't be winning an offensive beauty contest this season. The Wildcats should resolve to shoot less from beyond the arc and attack more for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. -- David CobbProvidence: A recommittment to doing the hard things  It's soul-searching season for a 7-6 Providence club that was one of the big-money spenders in free agency. Providence can't go anywhere in the Big East without finding the gumption to settle in and play defense, box out and stop playing \"after me, you come first\" offense. This defense needs an intervention. The Friars have allowed 1.23 points per possession in six games against top-100 teams, per hoop-explorer. That rates 347th (!) nationally. Whenever big man Oswin Erhunmwunse checks out, Providence's defense rates 365th nationally against top-100 teams. That's dead last in America. As usual, everything in basketball is interconnected, and it's hard to watch Providence and not feel that this group is playing unconnected, selfish basketball. The defensive effort is uninspiring at best and horrific at worst. The lack of ball movement offensively and the amount of quick-trigger jacks consistently put this transition defense in bad spots, too. \nThis team is unquestionably talented, but something has to give in a hurry. Jason Edwards' heaters are unstoppable. When he gets his feet set, freshman Stefan Vaaks is a net-shredder. Jaylin Sellers is a freakshow in transition. If rims could talk, they'd be terrified of Sellers' lefty drives. Jamier Jones looks like a senior linebacker trapped in a freshman's body. There's a good team in here somewhere, but it's getting late early.We'll learn a ton about the Friars' mental fortitude and whether they want to make something of this season in the next six days. Providence travels to St. John's on Saturday before hosting No. 4 UConn in an enormous tilt on Wednesday.  -- Isaac Trotter\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There is nothing in the sport of boxing that quite resonates to the masses like a thunderous knockout punch. Whether we are talking heavyweights or even the smallest of weight divisions, the criteria is typically a mix between the importance of the punch, the aesthetic (and violent) beauty of the finish and whether the knockout has that truly viral quality to it. Our panel of CBS Sports experts sat down, debated and cast our votes for knockout of the year in 2025. Let's take a look at the results: More Best of Boxing in 2025: Fighter of the Year | Fight of the YearWinner: Brian Norman Jr. def. Jin SasakiNorman, the former WBO welterweight beltholder from Atlanta who lost his title to Devin Haney in their much-hyped November showdown, helped take his name to the next level back in June when he defended his title in Tokyo against Jin Sasaki. The 25-year-old slugger, who kicked off 2025 with a third-round TKO of Derrieck Cuevas in March, returned just three months (and 7,000 miles) later to leave his mark inside the Ota City General Coliseum with an absolutely nasty one-punch knockout of Sasaki in Round 5. \nNorman built an early lead in the fight by scoring a pair of knockdowns in the opening round as he routinely exposed Sasaki's defensive gaps with powerful hooks. The action continued at close range as the fight progressed, with Sasaki unable to hurt Norman as the two continued to exchange punches in an increasingly exciting fight. But Sasaki's aggressive style caught up with him by Round 5. After Sasaki reached for a jab to the body, leaving his head exposed, Norman countered perfectly with a brutal left hook that dropped him in the center of the ring. The audible sound of Sasaki hitting the back of his head on the canvas could be heard on the broadcast as the impact knocked him out cold. Norman began instantly bowing to the crowd in celebration while standing in the neutral corner. Referee Gustavo Oliveiri, who picked up the count at five from the ringside timekeeper, suddenly realized there was no need to continue and waved off the bout at 46 seconds of the round. Norman showed good sportsmanship by dropping to his knees and bowing toward his fallen foe as medical responders rushed into the ring to attend to Sasaki. \nHonorable mentionsJai Opetaia def. Huseyin Cinkara: Opetaia defended his IBF and Ring Magazine cruiserweight titles against unheralded Cinkara in early December. While it would be difficult to get too excited about any win for Opetaia in a fight he was so heavily favored to win (upwards of +10000 at bell time), the champ found a way to make headlines in an expected victory. In the eighth round, Opeteia backed Cinkara toward the ropes before unloading with a left hand from his southpaw stance. The punch sent Cinkara crashing to the canvas, but not before he bounced off the ropes.\nDespite the resounding knockout, Opetaia was critical of his performance, saying, \"I feel like I just fought like shit, to be honest. You get these nights. We go back to the drawing board. I'm very disappointed in myself. I feel like I've let some people down with that performance. I made a lot of mistakes. I'm so pissed off.\"\nFabio Wardley def. Justis Huni: Heading into the 10th round of his fight with Huni, it looked like the momentum had run out of Wardley's time as an undefeated fighter. Huni, himself undefeated entering the bout, dominated the fight with slick, technical boxing. Not known as a tactician, Wardley proved that his power is the great equalizer in any fight as he landed a bomb of a right hand that dropped Huni to the canvas and brought the fight to a close midway through Round 10.Wardley would need to dig deep again in his next fight, scoring another late comeback knockout, this time against Joseph Parker to capture the interim WBO heavyweight championship in the biggest win of his career. Wardley has since been promoted to full champion after Oleksandr vacated the title. 2025 was a year that proved you can never count Wardley out at any point in a fight.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Happy New Year! While redraft managers are entering into the quiet time of year, one of my favorite things about Dynasty Fantasy Football is that there is no offseason. We are rapidly moving into 2026 NFL Draft prospect analysis and will soon start delivering our prospect profiles to get you ready for your rookie drafts. But first, it's time to update my Dynasty rankings at each position, and in this first installment of 2026, I am also including a look at my top three tiers at each position. At the wide receiver position, the top three tiers include my top 10 wide receivers, who will all be 27 years old or younger to start the 2026 season. While this was a difficult season at the position in Fantasy Football, the future still looks very bright.Tier 1Ja'Marr Chase, WR, BengalsJaxon Smith-Njigba, WR, SeahawksPuka Nacua, WR, RamsChase is the mainstay in this tier. He has been my WR1 in these rankings since Week 5 of the 2024 season. He has been top three in these rankings since October of 2021. And he doesn't even turn 26 years old until March 1st. That being said, Smith-Njigba is two years younger and outscored Chase this year, so it would not be that surprising if Chase's reign at the top ends soon.Tier 2Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR, LionsMalik Nabers, WR, GiantsCeeDee Lamb, WR, CowboysJustin Jefferson, WR, Vikings\nLamb and Jefferson have long been a part of that top tier with Chase. But they are the oldest wide receivers in my top 10, and they are both coming off down years. For Lamb, it will be very important to see whether the team is able to hold on to George Pickens. Pickens is a problem for Lamb's touchdown upside and the biggest target threat he has played with. Jefferson just needs better quarterback play and a better connection with his quarterback. Hopefully, they figure that out this offseason, because if Jefferson's 2026 looks like his 2025, then he won't be in the top 12 much longer.On the most recent episode of FFT Dynasty, I had Dan Schneier on to offer his takes on what we saw in 2025 and what it means for 2026. We talked Jaxson Dart, Marvin Harrison Jr., Harold Fannin, and more. Check it out:Tier 3Drake London, WR, FalconsRashee Rice, WR, ChiefsNico Collins, WR, TexansThis is the most interesting tier to me, because all three of these guys could go either direction. London flashed the top five upside we all believed he had for about six weeks in the middle of the 2025 season. But once again, the Falcons will enter 2026 with QB questions that could derail London's ascent to stardom. Rice was once again remarkable in another small sample size. In his last 17 games, including the playoffs, Rice has 114 catches for 1,307 yards and 8 TDs. But that has come across three seasons in a very unique role, and his QB may not be ready for Week 1. Collins is enormously talented, but coming off a down year with some young target competition emerging in the second half. Any of these guys could be in Tier 2 or Tier 4 by September.\nHere is the first edition of my 2026 Dynasty WR rankings:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After 12 months of exciting fights and even bigger moments, it's no surprise that so many big names would find themselves in contention for boxing's fighter of the year award to close 2025. The only thing left to debate is the actual criteria for such an award, especially when comparing campaigns like Terence Crawford, who scored only a single win over the past 12 months yet it was the defining one of his career and so impressive that it stands on equal footing with someone like fellow pound-for-pound stalwart Naoya Inoue, who defended his undisputed junior featherweight crown four times, albeit against lesser competition. While boxing endured a largely transitional year in 2025, especially from the standpoint of legacy promotions finding themselves at a crossroads just as TKO prepares to launch its new league, breakthrough performances were still plentiful. But which boxer stood out as the best overall for the year? Our panel of CBS Sports experts sat down, debated and cast our votes for boxing's fighter of the year. Let's take a look at the results.More Best of Boxing in 2025: Fight of the Year | Knockout of the Year\nWinner: Terence CrawfordEarning an honor as prestigious as this with only a single victory in any calendar year is difficult but there was simply nothing ordinary about the performance put forth by the unbeaten, 38-year-old Crawford in the final and most impressive bout of his 17-year pro career. The native of Omaha, Nebraska, who would retire from the sport just two months later, moved up three divisions in September from his welterweight prime to challenge undisputed super middleweight champion -- and Mexican legend -- Canelo Alvarez. Not only did Crawford look like anything but the smaller man after using his 13-month layoff to properly put on the muscle for his 168-pound debut, he ended up being the faster and even stronger boxer of the two throughout 12 brilliant rounds in a competitive unanimous decision. Watching Crawford land the bigger punches against the sturdy Alvarez was remarkable enough to see but he also left his fellow future Hall of Famer without answers as Crawford, who opened as a southpaw and never changed back to his natural orthodox, dictated the terms of the fight and instantly responded any time Alvarez built momentum. The victory made Crawford a five-division champion, joining an exclusive club that includes Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao. He also became the first three-division undisputed champion of the four-belt era and a four-division \"Ring\" champion. Crawford scored the biggest victories of his career during his final years at an advanced age, fully cementing himself as not just 2025's best and most impressive boxer but one of the truly greatest in the history of the sport. \nHonorable mentionsNaoya InoueTalk about bad luck having to go up against Crawford. Regardless, the reigning P4P king and Japanese \"Monster\" put on a tour de force in 2025 as he became the first boxer since Larry Holmes in 1983 to make four defenses of his \"Ring\" championship. The undisputed king of 122 pound continued to dominate his fourth weight division by beginning the year with a knockout of late replacement Ye Joon Kim in January before rising from the canvas to finish heavy underdog Ramon Cardenas in May, in a fight that was one of the year's best. But to close out the year, Inoue relied much more on his pure boxing ability and speed in September to completely dominate former unified champion Murodjon Akhmadaliev over 12 rounds before doing the same in December to mandatory challenger David Picasso. The only thing Inoue lacked in terms of his resume was a slate of dominant opponents but he made up for it with consistency and a true showcase of what makes him great. \nJesse \"Bam\" RodriguezThe 25-year-old phenom from San Antonio, who closed the year as a promotional free agent, put forth a pair of dominant performances that only further proclaimed the southpaw slugger as one of the most versatile and P4P best. In July, Rodriguez unified 115-pound titles by stopping unbeaten Phumelala Cafu in a 10th-round TKO. But \"Bam\" saved his best performance for four months later in Saudi Arabia when he unified junior bantamweight titles a second time against unbeaten WBA titleholder Fernando \"Puma\" Martinez, who had been considered by many as the king of the division for years. Rodriguez dealt with the awkwardness of the aggressive Martinez well before putting on a virtuoso display of footwork and well-crafted combinations. A perfect counter left hand in Round 10 dropped and finished Martinez for good as Rodriguez added yet another impressive name to his growing resume at such a young age.\nLamont Roach Jr. In what likely should have been a breakout year for the 30-year-old from just outside of Washington, D.C., turned out to be bittersweet following a pair of bad-luck majority draws against top competition. Those who truly know the sport, however, can realize just how impressive the pair of performances from the former 130-pound titleholder truly were as Roach twice moved up in weight to headline pay-per-view bouts as B-side, appearing to pull the upset in both cases despite the controversy and disputed scorecards. In March, Roach challenged lightweight champion and former amateur rival Gervonta Davis in Brooklyn, New York. Not only did Roach stand up to the crushing power of \"Tank,\" he landed some big shots of his own to wobble Davis in a fight that truly heated up in the second half. Roach would've scored a monster upset decision had it not been for a missed call from referee Steve Willis who chose not to rule a voluntary knee taken by Davis in Round 9 as a knockdown in a fight most felt Roach had already done enough to win. Nine months later in San Antonio, Roach moved up to 140 pounds and rose from the canvas in Round 3 to outslug Mexican star Isaac Cruz on the inside and force the aggressive \"Pitbull\" to back pedal and circle away. Instead of being given the breakthrough win of his career, the judges once again couldn't declare a winner. The biggest crime of it all is that none of the six judges scored either fight for Roach despite the fact that he used 2025 to build his star and reputation while showcasing both his toughness and adaptability at higher weight classes.  \n            ",

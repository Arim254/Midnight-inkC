On Wednesday, FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the charges against Wedding, and the FBI is offering $15 million for information that leads to Wedding's arrest.Earlier this year, the FBI added Wedding to its Ten Most Wanted list and initially offered $10 million for information on his whereabouts. On Wednesday, Bondi called the former snowboarder \"one of the most prolific and violent drug trafficking organizers in the world,\" according to USA Today.Wedding, 44, is accused of trafficking drugs, primarily cocaine and fentanyl, between Mexico, the United States and Canada. Bondi stated that Wedding is the largest distributor of cocaine in his native country of Canada as he imports 60 metric tons of the drug from Mexico into the U.S. every year for a billion-dollar operation.\n        \n            \n                Ryan Wedding, ex-Olympic snowboarder, added to FBI's Ten Most Wanted amid drug trafficking, murder accusations\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBondi also alleged that Wedding is aided by the Mexican Sinola cartel, which is protecting him as the FBI continues its search.\nWedding is accused of killing a U.S. federal witness in Colombia. Authorities say the witness was murdered before he was able to testify against Wedding, and a $2 million reward is being offered for more information about the witness' murder. Prior to the witness' death, law enforcement recovered $15.2 million between physical assets and cryptocurrency.Here is the complete list of charges against Wedding, per USA Today.Conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaineConspiracy to export cocaineConspiracy to commit murder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crimeMurder in connection with a continuing criminal enterprise and drug crimeConspiracy to tamper with a witness, victim, or informantTampering with a witness, victim, or informantConspiracy to retaliate against a witness, victim, or informantRetaliation against a witness, victim, or informantConspiracy to launder monetary instrumentsWedding allegedly has a lengthy list of aliases.

    "body": "\n        New York Jets cornerback Kris Boyd, 29, was upgraded to stable condition Wednesday after he was shot in the abdomen early Sunday morning in New York. Boyd was previously listed in critical but stable condition, police said. CBS News reported Monday that a bullet was lodged in Boyd's lung and he underwent surgery.Boyd posted on his Instagram story on Wednesday that he was starting to breathe on his own.\"I'm sorry I have no words at the moment,\" Boyd wrote. \"Just grateful! I'm coming along, starting to breathe on my own now. Sincerely appreciate everyone!\"Jets coach Aaron Glenn addressed the incident for the first time on Wednesday and said Boyd is in good spirits.\n\"That's what eases my mind is that he's in good spirits,\" Glenn said. \"His wife and his kid, they're in good spirits and he'll walk away from this just fine.\"The investigation is ongoing after NYPD received a 911 call on Sunday at 2:09 a.m. ET. On Monday, the police released images of a potential suspect wanted in connection with the shooting. Boyd was with a group on West 38th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway when an argument took place with another group. Boyd was then hit by gunfire. Police released surveillance footage and pictures of the person of interest in the shooting, but no arrests have been made.\n\"We are aware of the situation involving Kris Boyd and will have no further comment at this time,\" a Jets spokesperson told CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. The NFL did not offer further comment, telling CBS Sports it has been in contact with the franchise.Boyd has not suited up for the Jets this season. He was placed on injured reserve in August after suffering a shoulder injury during a team scrimmage.Several players reacted to the frightening news on Sunday, including Jets defensive end Jermaine Johnson II:\n\"It's tough news to hear,\" Jets tight end Jeremy Ruckert said on Monday. \"You know, one of our guys, and you know we're all thinking of him and wishing him well, and his family. So other than that, we're going to keep everything in-house about what's going on. Just thinking of him and his family.\"Boyd, who played his college football at the University of Texas, was originally a seventh-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings in 2019, also playing for the Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans. Boyd has spent most of his NFL career on special teams, racking up 105 tackles, three pass defenses and two forced fumbles in 81 career games. The Jets did not play on Sunday after falling to the New England Patriots on Thursday night, 27-14. They will face the Baltimore Ravens on the road in Week 12. \n            ",

Netflix will air the standalone Opening Night game, the Home Run Derby, and the Field of Dreams Game.\"Our  new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix provide  us with a great opportunity to expand our reach to fans through  three powerful destinations for live sports, entertainment, and marquee  events,\" commissioner Robert Manfred said in a statement. \"Following  our last World Series game that averaged more than 51 million viewers  globally, these partnerships build on MLB's  growing momentum that includes generational stars setting new standards  for excellence, new rules which have improved the game on the field,  and increases in important fan engagement metrics like viewership,  attendance, participation and social media consumption.  We're looking forward to tapping into the unique areas of expertise  that ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix each bring to the sport for the  benefit of our fans.\" The New York Yankees and San Francisco Giants are scheduled to play in next year's Opening Night game on March 25. That is the only game on the schedule that day and it will be a Netflix exclusive. The Minnesota Twins and Philadelphia Phillies will play in the Field of Dreams Game on Aug. 13 in Dyersville, Iowa.Sunday Night Baseball will air only on Peacock, NBC's streaming service, when there are conflicts with the NBA and NFL. Peacock broadcast Sunday morning games from 2022-23 before those games shifted to Roku in 2024.\nESPN, meanwhile, gains rights to the popular MLB.TV service, which allows fans to watch out-of-market games for all 30 teams. ESPN also has in-market rights to six teams (Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks, Cleveland Guardians, Colorado Rockies, San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners) and the option to add more if they become available. ESPN will also carry 30 exclusive weeknight games.\"This fan-friendly agreement allows us to showcase the great sport of baseball on both a local and national level, while prioritizing our streaming future,\" ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement.It is not yet clear how ESPN will sell MLB.TV, though the price is expected to remain the same, reports The Athletic. An agreement allowing T-Mobile customers to receive MLB.TV for free is expected to continue as well.\nMLB and ESPN mutually opted out of their previous agreement in February. At the time, Manfred said it \"wouldn't be beneficial to accept a smaller deal to remain on a shrinking platform,\" adding he was unhappy with ESPN's coverage of baseball.ESPN was set to pay MLB $1.65 billion from 2026-28 as part of the previous agreement. National television money is split equally between the 30 teams.Fox will continue to broadcast the All-Star Game, Division Series and Championship Series games, and the World Series.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The hits just keep coming for the Florida Panthers, and now they're suffering injuries away from the rink too. On Wednesday, coach Paul Maurice announced that forward Eetu Luostarinen is expected to miss time after what he described as a \"barbecuing mishap.\"Maurice said that Luostarinen suffered burns in the incident, but it wasn't serious enough that he had to stay overnight in the hospital. Still, Luostarinen was burnt badly enough that Maurice labeled him \"week-to-week,\" and his return timeline may depend on when he's comfortable wearing pads again.\"I'm gonna list him as week-to-week because we don't have a lot of experience with this,\" Maurice said. \"Some of it's when he comes back and feels comfortable putting the equipment on. He wasn't in the hospital overnight. He did get seen by doctors in that vein.\"\n        \n            \n                Connor Bedard, Macklin Celebrini and Leo Carlsson have arrived as the NHL's next wave of superstars\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLuostarinen joins a laundry list of Panthers on the shelf due to injury. At this point, Florida, currently 10-8-1 on the season, could field quite the starting lineup with its injury report.F Aleksander Barkov (knee)F Matthew Tkachuk (abductor)D Dmitry Kulikov (labrum)F Eetu Luostarinen (burns)F Jonah Gadjovich (upper-body)F Cole Schwindt (arm)With seven players out of the lineup, the Florida lineup will look very different in the coming weeks and months. Maurice said his team, the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion, is just trying to \"survive\" for now, and admitted that missing that number of bodies is \"trouble\" for any team.\nBetween Barkov, Tkachuk, Kulikov, and Luostarinen, the Panthers are down four players who were pivotal in them repeating as Stanley Cup champions last summer. The three forwards combined for 19 goals and 47 assists last postseason, and Kulikov played a key role in the team's shutdown defense.The Panthers will now have to adapt to keep their heads above water in a very competitive Eastern Conference. If they can stay in the fight until reinforcements arrive, they may be better for it.\"We won't be dominant in a lot of games because of the personnel that's out, but we're staying in them,\" Maurice said. \"I think we're getting better in some areas we weren't even great in. We're forced to adapt our style of hockey to the players that are in. Some of that adaptation we'll get to keep. That's the idea. We're trying to do some things differently than we've done in the past.\"\nIf there's any good injury news for the Panthers, it's that Tkachuk could start skating in the next couple of weeks before making his return in December.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks are a franchise in turmoil after firing general manager Nico Harrison as the team failed to live up to his vision follow",
    "body": "\n        The Dallas Mavericks are a franchise in turmoil after firing general manager Nico Harrison as the team failed to live up to his vision following the disastrous trade sending Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. With Harrison gone, the Mavs desperately need to create a new vision for the team that they can sell to fans, and the obvious way to do so is to shift the focus to the future and build around No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg. To do so, they will need to unload high-priced veterans, most notably the centerpiece of the return for Dončić, Anthony Davis. Ever since Harrison was fired, the expectation has been that Davis' days in Dallas are numbered, and on Wednesday we got our first strongly reported confirmation of that from ESPN's Tim MacMahon. MacMahon cites multiple team sources who said the team will \"explore the trade market\" for Davis ahead of the February deadline. However, minority owner Mark Cuban (once the team's majority owner) told The Athletic that the Mavs would not be trading Davis, saying simply, \"We won't. We want to try to win.\" \nThat call won't be Cuban's to make alone, as he does not have final say in personnel decisions anymore but does have considerably more input now than he did under Harrison's front office -- as evidenced by him being blindsided by the Dončić trade like everyone else. Cuban is now serving as an adviser to majority owner Patrick Dumont as part of a committee that is leading the Mavericks' basketball operations division after Harrison's ouster. \n        \n            \n                Anthony Davis trade rumors: Ranking every NBA team as a possible landing spot for Mavericks' star big man\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt would make sense for the Mavericks to state publicly their intentions to keep Davis while still exploring the market for him. If the rest of the league believes Dallas is in a hurry to move off of Davis, they'll struggle to field strong offers. The biggest challenge in moving Davis was already going to be that there is no chance they get back anything close to what they gave up to bring him to Dallas. At this point it seems like they are treating the Dončić trade as a sunk cost. That can't be the bar a Davis trade is held to, and if they go in with a realistic expectation, then a deal could get done. Even so, they'll want to maximize their return and that means doing their best to negotiate from a place of strength rather than apparent desperation.\nEven being more realistic, the Mavs will need Davis to eventually return to the floor and play like the All-Star caliber center he long has been. His latest calf strain has forced him to be held out for multiple weeks. And given his injury history, teams acquiring the 32-year-old will have their concerns about giving up a haul to bring him in given the injury risk. As for which teams could be interested in Davis, if the Warriors are serious about going all-in on trying to win another title with Stephen Curry, they have a glaring need for frontcourt reinforcements to aid Curry and Jimmy Butler. Davis would give them another high-end veteran to chase another title, and Dallas could finally be a landing spot for Jonathan Kuminga, giving him a fresh start on a team with a more future-facing timeline alongside Flagg. If Davis is on the market, it's fair to wonder if we'll be headed down a mini-fire sale route in Dallas come February. They could look to sell off a number of their veteran pieces, like PJ Washington, Daniel Gafford and Klay Thompson, not to mention Kyrie Irving, who is hoping to return to the court at some point this season. It might be difficult maximizing return for Irving if he hasn't played before the deadline, but he could certainly be on the table this summer if they want to fully shift focus to a youth movement around Flagg. \nEverything will be on the table now that Harrison is gone. The first order of business for many would be finding a way to undo as much of the Dončić trade as possible by trading Davis, but the team is, at least publicly, insisting they aren't ready to hit the reset button just yet. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- For much of the 2025 season, the Dallas Cowboys' (4-5-1) defense (29.3 points per game allowed, the second-most in the NFL) has been the team's problem child in comparison to the offense, a unit that is the league's No. 2 scoring offense (29.6 points per game). However, that wasn't the case in Week 1 in Dallas' narrow 24-20 road loss at the defending Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles. The Cowboys limited running back Saquon Barkley to just 3.3 yards per carry (60 yards rushing and a touchdown on 18 carries), and they held quarterback Jalen Hurts to just 152 yards passing. All-Pro wide receiver A.J. Brown wasn't even able to be targeted until late in the fourth quarter. What made the difference in the game's final score margin was how Hurts created plays with his feet. He totaled nine scrambles for 63 yards rushing: those nine scrambles stand as second-most in a game of his career while the 63 yards after those aforementioned scrambles mark his fourth-most in a game off of scrambles. Both his 4-yard rushing touchdown in the first quarter and his 8-yard rushing touchdown in the second quarter came off of Hurts' scrambling after escaping the pocket. His seven rushing first downs in Week 1 against the Cowboys stand as his 2025 season high, and almost all of them, five to be exact, came on third down. These plays made the difference in the narrow Eagles victory. \"I think Jalen is an incredible player. He can beat you throwing and can beat you running. We have to do a great job of keeping him in the pocket. We learned that in the last game that he can extend plays,\" Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said on Wednesday. \"I think you could put their two receivers up there with DeVonta [Smith] and A.J. [Brown] against anybody in the league. They're very, very talented. At any moment, they could strike. They're explosive. ... Again, I think everybody finds their flow at different times. This is a tough, tough league. At the end of the day, I'm not looking at the film and saying these guys are struggling. I'm looking at this film and saying these guys are dangerous.\"\nThe addition of All-Pro defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, whom Dallas acquired in a trade deadline deal from the New York Jets, could be the X factor in limiting the damage Hurts can do on the ground given his firsthand experience with the reigning Super Bowl MVP quarterback. He and Hurts came to the University of Alabama in the same recruiting class and were Crimson Tide teammates going head to head in practice for three seasons from 2016 to 2018 before Williams became the 2019 NFL Draft's third overall pick. \"I've played with him at Bama, probably one of the strongest quarterbacks in the NFL,\" Williams said on Wednesday. ... \"The main thing is just rushing the passer man. Being efficient, rushing with togetherness and chemistry, especially in the defensive line room. Just being effective.\" The chemistry is looking strong early on with Williams being integrated into Dallas' defensive line: the Cowboys allowed a season low in points (16) and tied their season high in sacks (5) in their 33-16 \"Monday Night Football\" win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 11. He led the team with 1.5 sacks while also totaling a career-high five quarterback hits. That led fellow Dallas defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa to say postgame that he \"immediately\" felt Williams' impact Monday night. \n\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: George Pickens' breakout season with Cowboys puts Jerry Jones on the clock for another mega deal\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I wasn't surprised about their [the defensive line's] or my performance in general because in the two days we had to practice together [after the bye], everybody in that defensive line room works extremely hard,\" Williams said. \"Even the [position] coach works extremely hard trying to get themselves right to be able to be effective, dominate and do their job to the best of their ability. So going out with them, I was super confident in everybody because I got a chance to see everybody working and how everybody carries themselves week in and week out.\" That early chemistry with Williams could make the difference against Hurts on Sunday afternoon at AT&T Stadium. \"He's [Williams] going to impact the quarterback in different ways,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Again, it's going to come down to our rush-lane discipline and our eyes and things like that. Again, you're caught when he gets out because he has the ability to beat you throwing the ball or running the ball. We were able to look at the game and talk about some different answers and things like that to try to contain him. He's [Hurts] hard to contain.\"\nThe initial reviews of how the three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle impacts the game even on the Cowboys' practice are nothing but sparkling, so perhaps Williams' production will continue to soar to All-Pro-caliber heights with a second full week of work in Dallas before facing the Eagles. \"Obviously, he's [Williams] a very talented interior rusher. ... So just going up against him has definitely made me pick up a few things, be a little bit more savvy,\" Cowboys Pro Bowl left guard Tyler Smith said on Wednesday. \"I think it's great work. I think we have one of the most, real talk, talented interior D-line rooms in the league right now. Definitely one of the most expensive, but I think it's a lot of talent in the trenches. I think it does nothing but make us get better each and every day being able to work against guys like that.\"It's not just Williams that will provide a different picture for Hurts at the snap in Week 12: Dallas also added veteran linebacker Logan Wilson at the trade deadline and now has two more young talents at linebacker in DeMarvion Overshown and at cornerback in third-round rookie Shavon Revel Jr. -- both of whom returned from torn ACLs in Week 11. \n\"I think that's still just an 11-man thing. It's going to be more than a one or two-person thing. That goes from as far as like if there's a play call where somebody is asked to spy, or just a [pass] rush front. You're asked to contain. It's just different players assigned to that job,\" Overshown said Wednesday. \"So I'm pretty sure we're going to be more dialed in on it this game. That's really one of the only things that hurt us last game. We'll definitely be on it this game.\"The belief in what the Cowboys defense can be with its overhauled personnel is sky high, and now Dallas has a true chance to test that belief with games against the Eagles (8-2), the three-time defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs (5-5) and at the Detroit Lions (6-4), last season's top seed in the NFC, over the next 12 days. It starts with slowing down Hurts and Co. on Sunday. \"We got new guys like Q [Quinnen Williams], Logan [Wilson], Rev [Shavon Revel] and guys like [starting safeties] Hook [Malik Hooker] and Dono [Donovan Wilson] coming back from injury. You're like 'OK, these are elite talents in the NFL. Any team goes without this type of caliber of guys, they are going to deal with some issues throughout the season,\" Overshown said. \"So I think now that 'Flus [defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus] has his guys in there, and we've worked together through the bye practicing together and now we got a game under our belt, it's really only up from here. I feel like the energy is there, and everybody is excited to be out there.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon and Auston Matthews are all still in the prime of their respective careers, but the next wave of NHL superstars aren't content to wait their turn. Connor Bedard, Macklin Celebrini and Leo Carlsson have announced their arrival with authority this season.In the 2023 NHL Draft, Bedard and Carlsson were the top two picks, respectively. One year later, Celebrini was the prize of the draft lottery, going No. 1 overall. None of them can legally drink in the United States, but they're already holding their own against the best players in the world.Celebrini, after his second hat trick of the season, is up to 30 points. That puts him in a tie with the Oilers' McDavid for second in the league. Bedard, following his second hat trick already this season, ranks fourth. That leaves Carlsson, who is really slacking, in eighth place with 26 points. That's impressive for a trio of players aged 20 or younger, but their impact goes much deeper than simply filling up the scoresheet.Each player is the crown jewel of his respective franchise's rebuild, something that brings the hefty weight of expectations and pressure. To this point, they've borne that burden extremely well and flourished in the process.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks, Anaheim Ducks and San Jose Sharks have been moribund franchises for years now, but these young superstars have instilled hope as all three teams aim to throw a wrench into the 2026 Stanley Cup Playoffs picture.Young stars delivering on the hypeIn the case of Bedard, he was billed as the best prospect since McDavid entered the league in 2015. He certainly looked the part as a rookie in 2023-24, posting 61 points in 68 games and winning the Calder Trophy. Last season, however, Bedard regressed on a horrific Blackhawks team. He totaled 67 points in 82 games, and his defensive metrics were cause for concern.Now in his third season, Bedard, 20, has taken a clear leap and looks like a far more confident player than at any point in 2024-25. It's just another reminder that development, even for the best prospects, is rarely linear.\nThis season, Bedard is making opponents look foolish on a consistent basis. His 4.33 points per 60 minutes are seventh in the NHL, per Natural Stat Trick, and he's tied for fifth in the league with 16 five-on-five points. He isn't simply feasting on big power play minutes.Bedard's combination of intelligence, vision and his elite shot make him a threat to make a play from anywhere on the ice. When it comes to his playmaking, Bedard is somewhat reminiscent of Patrick Kane in the way he can almost freeze opposing defenders while he scans the rink to find the best play.Then, of course, there is the skill when he senses blood in the water. Poor Morgan Frost had no chance once Bedard realized he had him dead to rights.\nCelebrini, 19, finished second in Calder Trophy voting last season, but that was only because Lane Hutson was on another planet down the stretch. As an 18-year-old last season, Celebrini was asked to carry the Sharks. He did so admirably and put up 63 points in 70 games.If anyone was worried about a sophomore clump for Celebrini, they can put those fears to bed. He is producing at a rate of 4.39 points per 60 minutes and has equaled Bedard with 16 five-on-five points, per Natural Stat Trick. Again, Celebrini is doing most of the heavy lifting for a Sharks team that lacks any kind of meaningful depth up front.Similar to Bedard, Celebrini has a high hockey IQ and plenty of skill to accompany that, but his compete level jumps off the screen every night as well. Take this game-winning play against the New York Rangers earlier in the season. After a quality scoring chance of his own, Celebrini pursues the puck, wins a battle along the boards and keeps his head up to place a one-timer on a tee for teammate Will Smith.\nOf the three players, Carlsson might be the most well-rounded right now. In addition to a staggering 4.21 points per 60 minutes (good for seventh in the NHL), Carlsson is driving play far better than his two peers. With Carlsson on the ice at five-on-five, the Ducks are controlling 56.1% of the expected goals, per Natural Stat Trick. That's a great number for any player, let alone for a young man who still can't buy himself a drink in any U.S. establishment. (He turns 21 the day after Christmas.) In all fairness to Bedard and Celebrini, some of that discrepancy can be explained by the team around Carlsson, which is filled with a nice mix of veterans and up-and-coming players.Bedard and Celebrini do have Carlsson beat in terms of raw five-on-five production as the young Ducks star has just eight points in that situation. However, Carlsson should close that gap if Anaheim keeps dominating scoring chances and expected goals when he's in the game.\nAt 6-foot-3 and 208 pounds, Carlsson has a clear size advantage over the other two young guns, and he is learning how to use his frame more frequently. In perhaps his nastiest goal of the season, Carlsson showed that he is the full package.Against the Golden Knights, Carlsson gave defenseman Noah Hanifin all he could handle on the forecheck, forced a turnover with a physical play on Brett Howden, got to open ice and finished with one of the smoothest backhands you'll ever see.\nCan they crash the playoff party?It's still very early in the season, but all three players have their team firmly in the playoff mix. Carlsson's Ducks are leading the Pacific Division with 25 points, Bedard's Blackhawks occupy the West's first wild card spot with 24 points, and Celebrini's Sharks are right in the wild card race at 21 points.\nSo, what are the chances that those teams can stay in the race for 82 games? It's tough to say, but it does seem like the Ducks have the best shot of the three. Here are each team's playoff chances, according to MoneyPuck:Ducks: 80.8%Blackhawks: 49.9%Sharks: 13.5%Anaheim is the more complete team, as I mentioned earlier. It has been building toward this longer than the other two, and Carlsson seems like he is the biggest piece to that puzzle.Chicago, while it's certainly improved around Bedard, still has a lot of questions. Spencer Knight is excellent in goal, but the Blackhawks have holes all throughout their defense, and the forward depth is very suspect. On top of that, most of Chicago's underlying numbers indicate that this start is unsustainable.\nThe Blackhawks have a PDO -- which simply adds team shooting and save percentages -- of 1.050. The next closest team is the Pittsburgh Penguins at 1.034. Think of PDO as a temperature gauge in a car. Right now Chicago is running dangerously hot, and it's due for a cool down.You can copy and paste most of that for the Sharks, which have one of the worst defensive groups in the league, although Celebrini probably has more help than Bedard at forward. It's just going to be hard for San Jose to keep opposing teams out of its net enough to stay in the wild card race all season.All that said, we've seen young superstars drag teams kicking and screaming into the playoffs before. Just look at what the Montreal Canadiens did last season. Besides, the most important thing for all three teams is that they're finally making an ascent with their young cornerstones leading the way.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        CINCINNATI -- For the first time in more than two months, Joe Burrow was a full participant at practice for the Cincinnati Bengals. The team's star quarterback actually returned to practice last week, but he was a limited participant in each session. The fact that he's now fully able to participate in practice means that he's just taken one giant step closer to a possible return. One thing Burrow wasn't able to do last week was participate in 11-on-11 drills, but he did that on Wednesday. It's still unclear when Burrow will be able to return to game action, but Bengals coach Zac Taylor did add some intrigue to the situation during his press conference on Wednesday. The Bengals' current starting QB, Joe Flacco, is dealing with a shoulder injury and Taylor gave an interesting answer when he was asked if Flacco would be the starter on Sunday against the New England Patriots. \"We'll keep working through it and see how we go through the week,\" Taylor said. Flacco was a limited participant in Wednesday's practice due to the shoulder injury, but that's not anything new. Since suffering the injury in Week 8, the Bengals have basically been giving Flacco each Wednesday off. Taylor was asked if there was any scenario where Burrow might play against the Patriots, and once again, he wasn't willing to offer a definitive answer. \n\"Until we get through some practices, there's no reason for me to even speculate on that,\" Taylor said. With Flacco sitting out of practice on Wednesday, that gave Burrow a chance to get some reps with the first team. \"I think you can certainly get a lot of work in with Joe Burrow today because Joe Flacco isn't practicing because the plan has been get [Burrow] into 11 on 11, so it works well,\" Taylor said. \nBefore Wednesday, Burrow hadn't fully participated in a Bengals practice since Sept. 12, and then, just two days later, he suffered a Grade 3 turf toe injury in a 31-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Burrow was placed on injured reserve shortly after that and that's where he's been ever since. The Bengals activated his 21-day practice window on Nov. 10 and they now have until Dec. 1 to decide whether to move him to the active roster. Based on the fact that he's now fully practicing, it seems like it's only a matter of time before they activate him. Burrow has missed a total of eight games so far and the Bengals have gone 1-7 in his absence. \n        \n            \n                Where does Browns' Myles Garrett rank among NFL's all-time pass rushers amid historic 2025 pace?\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill Burrow actually play on Sunday? This is now the big question and although we don't have a definitive answer from Taylor, the guess here would be that he doesn't play this week against the Patriots. If the Bengals were to play him on Sunday against the Patriots, that would mean Burrow would have to play two games in five days -- the Bengals play the Ravens on Thanksgiving in Week 13 -- and it's highly unlikely that they would ask him to do that. Basically, although the door is apparently open for him to play this week, it would be a total surprise if he did. The more likely target for a Burrow return is Thanksgiving. Burrow has only spoken with the media once since his injury and that came back on Nov. 10. During that interview, the Bengals QB gave a one-word answer when asked how meaningful it would be for him to return against the Ravens on Thanksgiving night. \n\"Very,\" Burrow said. \nBurrow has been targeting a Thanksgiving return and now, that seems even more likely. If that doesn't happen it could also be pushed to Week 14. CBS Sports sideline reporter Melanie Collins talked to the Bengals on Sunday morning and was given two possible dates. \"I was told by the Bengals this morning that Week 13 against the Ravens is a possibility, as is Week 14 against the Bills. But as of now, no definitive return date for Joe Burrow,\" Collins said during the Bengals' 34-12 loss to the Steelers on Sunday. Of course, even if he's healthy enough to play, the Bengals need to figure out if it even makes sense to put him back on the field. CBSSports.com NFL writer Tyler Sullivan doesn't think the Bengals should bring Burrow back under any circumstance this year due to the fact that their season is already lost (You can read his full reasoning here). The season would go from bad to worse if Burrow returned only to get injured again. \nBack on Nov. 10, Burrow was actually asked if the team's record would factor into his decision to possibly return and he mostly sidestepped the question. \"We'll see how these next couple of weeks go,\" Burrow said. \"We'll see how it feels. We'll make a decision when the time comes.\"If Burrow wants to play, it's hard to imagine the Bengals stopping him, especially if he's fully cleared and 100% healthy. And now that he's back at practice, it only seems like a matter of time before he's back on the field and don't be surprised if he's on your television Thanksgiving night. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin's career has transformed into a reality show, a soap opera packed with so many twists and turns that forecasting the next move for the hottest coach in college football is a fool's errand.Whether he stays at Ole Miss or bolts for Florida or LSU is anyone's guess. No. 6 Ole Miss (10-1) is on the cusp of its first-ever College Football Playoff, and yet the coach who has led the Rebels to unprecedented success -- three consecutive 10-win seasons -- seems unfazed by the frenzy he helped spark in Oxford. As speculation of his interest -- or lack thereof -- in Florida and LSU's job openings spread, the coach again refused to tip his hand Wednesday.\"I'm saying the same thing for six years,\" Kiffin said on an SEC teleconference. \"I'm not talking about speaking on other jobs. I'm focused on this one.\"\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss wants clarity from Lane Kiffin. He's not in a position to give it.

His family, however, has not stayed put. His ex-wife, Layla, and other family members flew to Gainesville, Florida on Sunday to visit the city, sources told CBS Sports, and on Monday they caught another flight to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nOn Wednesday, Kiffin didn't advance the plot, but he he absolutely stirred the pot. When asked if he felt flattered that three SEC schools are pursuing him as head coach, he responded: \"It doesn't feel good on this call.\"Somehow it's got spun really negatively. I said it before: if programs want your coach, that should be looked at as an amazing thing and a great thing by your fans. So if programs want your coach because you're 10-1 and whatever -- three 10-win seasons in a row, which has never been done in Ole Miss before -- is that a good thing that other programs want your coach because your program's experienced success it's never had? Or would you rather be 5-6 or 6-5 or something right now and no one wants your coach? I would look at it from that perspective.\"The administration understands exactly what's at stake. Gratitude for historic success doesn't erase urgency, and Ole Miss officials hope to secure a commitment from Kiffin by week's end, sources told CBS Sports. The Rebels begin preparations Sunday for the regular-season finale against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl.\nAthletics director Keith Carter and Kiffin's representatives have been negotiating for more than three weeks, with sources describing late-October conversations -- soon after Florida fired Billy Napier -- as \"positive.\" But that was nearly a month ago, a lifetime in the wild world of college athletics.\"Keith and I have a great relationship. We communicate daily on a lot of things and I love it here,\" Kiffin said. \"it's been amazing. We're in the season that's the greatest run in the history of Ole Miss at this point, having never been at this point. So I think it's really exciting. I think Saturday night (against Florida) was amazing.\"I'm just living in the moment -- it's amazing -- and our players are too. I see their joy about the practice season, where they're at and have so much on the line. It's just awesome to be a part of.\"\nEven so, Kiffin sounded flummoxed when asked by a reporter whether he would coach the Rebels in the Egg Bowl, and fired back with rhetorical questions on Wednesday.\"Do I expect to coach next week?\" he said. \"Why would I not expect to coach next week? I mean, I expected to coach against Florida (last week), too. So I don't even understand the question of how I would not expect to coach next week. Why would I be at work?\"But a clock is still ticking. If he intends to accept a rival SEC job, it's hard to imagine him staying on to shepherd Ole Miss through a playoff run. In that scenario, the Rebels would need a postseason contingency plan for an interim coach. Defensive coordinator Pete Golding and quarterbacks coach Joe Judge would be considered, sources said.\nCBS Sports asked Kiffin outright whether he might take another job before the postseason begins.\"I'm not speaking on other jobs,\" he responded.And so the carousel spins, with three SEC fan bases twisting in the wind.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As Chelsea ready themselves to face a side who have for so long been the yardstick against which all other European clubs are measured, they might ask whether they are hitting their own standards, let alone the lofty ones that Barcelona continue to set.Sonia Bompastor's side are unbeaten in all competitions. They occupy one of the top four spots in the Champions League table that will guarantee them a quarterfinal berth with home advantage. The sky is hardly falling in. However, a 1-1 draw at Liverpool was a third draw in nine Women's Super League games, one that allowed Manchester City to open up a three-point lead at the top of the table. All four of those draws have been by the same scoreline, and of course, some 1-1 draws are different from others. It is one thing to get within three minutes of beating Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, another to register just one shot on target against the league's bottom side. Both, however, speak to a broader trend that has emerged early in year two under Bompastor, the sense that this team lacks the ruthless edge that could take it beyond the likes of Barcelona.Certainly, they are not as free-scoring as past teams were. Their nine WSL games have delivered just 16 goals, exactly half of their tally at this stage of last season. Alyssa Thompson's goals in back-to-back games have certainly been welcome, but she cannot cover the holes in an attack that is feeling the absences of Mayra Ramirez (hamstring), Lauren James (ankle) and Guro Reiten, who welcomed the birth of her son earlier this month. Their absence is all the more profoundly felt as Sam Kerr continues to work her way back after nearly two years on the sidelines.\nNo wonder this side is taking fewer shots and carving out more infrequent chances than it has in recent years, and by a fair margin, their 16.3 shots per game a 15 percent drop from last season's side, who dropped as many points in all 22 games as this iteration have already in the WSL. And yet it is not quite as straightforward a tale of outright attacking drop off as the conflation of pure injuries and some off-color performances might suggest. The volume of openings Chelsea are making for themselves might have dropped. The quality of them has not.If anything, Chelsea are making better chances for themselves. A rise from 2.06 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) per WSL game to 2.2 npxG might be nothing more than a bit of variance; that latter is a small sample size after all. It could also be the case, though, that the story of this season so far is nothing more than some bad form in front of goal at the wrong moments, leading 27 goals from almost 32 xG. Aggie Beever-Jones, Wieke Kaptein, Catarina Macario, Sjoeke Nusken, Reiten: all have notably fewer actual goals than expected. Given the quality of these footballers, it is hard to believe that that won't change for most of them in the next few months.Shots taken by Chelsea this season, sized by xG value \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            The worry coming out of the draw with Liverpool was that the data had it as a rather different game to the other 1-1s. This wasn't Chelsea hammering on the door for 20-odd shots and three-ish xG as it had been against Twente and Manchester United. It was a team who didn't really go anywhere for an hour against a team they would have expected to swat aside. No wonder Bompastor was keen to remind her players of what is expected after a bad result.\n\"At Chelsea, we are used to bouncing back really quickly,\" she said. \"It will be a tough challenge, but our job is to make sure we focus on the next one. We take the learnings from Sunday and we go into the next one ready to compete.\"That will certainly be a challenge against Barcelona, who sit atop the Champions League table with three wins from three, the only blemish on a winning season being a shock defeat at Real Sociedad. The Catalans might be strong favorites for this competition, but that defeat was a sign that they are not invulnerable. Rocked first by their defeat to Arsenal in May's European final and then by La Liga salary limits that forced six exits to the WSL, they may not be quite the same team that beat Chelsea 4-1 home and away in last season's Champions League semifinal.They might not be the team they were last season, but the question heading into Thursday night is whether Chelsea are either. Are they a team unfortunate to have run into a cold streak in the early weeks of an injury-hit campaign, or one who don't have the killer instinct to put to bed the worst team in the WSL? If it's the latter, this could be a trying night at Stamford Bridge indeed.\nViewing informationDate: Thursday, Nov. 20 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Stamford Bridge -- London, EnglandLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Chelsea +450; Draw +450; Barca -188\n            ",

Among them is an NFC North battle between the Minnesota Vikings (4-6) and Green Bay Packers (6-3-1) at Lambeau Field in Green Bay. Minnesota won both matchups a year ago against the Packers. The Packers are -6.5 favorites, but are just 3-7 against the spread, while Minnesota is 4-6 ATS. Another huge matchup has the AFC-leading Indianapolis Colts (8-2) traveling to Kansas City to face the 5-5 Chiefs, who have lost two in a row.

    "body": "\n        If you're looking for fantasy basketball value, all-around producers averaging 10+ points, 5+ rebounds, and 5+ assists offer it in bunches. These versatile players boost multiple fantasy basketball categories simultaneously, making them ideal targets for your NBA fantasy team. With NBA depth charts constantly shifting due to NBA injuries and lineup changes, monitoring these triple-threat contributors provides a strategic edge in both category and points leagues.Veteran All-Around Fantasy OptionsRussell Westbrook has played more than 20 minutes in 11 of his 14 appearances this season, with the first two games of the season accounting for two of the three outings where he played less than 20. He also came off the bench for three straight games before seeing his first start of the campaign, but since then, he has started in eight of 11 games. In his third game of the year, he dropped 18 points, six rebounds and six assists, which was the first real flash of what he has been able to deliver for the Kings. He is up to three double-doubles and two triple-doubles, while averaging 14.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.0 steals on the season, showing he is still one of the best all-around contributors in the game. In his 17th NBA season, James Harden stands out as the most steady and effective contributor on his team, while injuries continue to take a toll on his most highly-rated teammates. He remains one of the league's best offensive talents, averaging 26.2 points per game, while shooting an average of 37.6 percent from deep and 92.2 percent from the foul line. His ability to shine as a distributor has elevated his game for years, and he is on pace to average over eight assists per game for the eighth time in his career. Meanwhile, he has averaged over 5.0 rebounds for 12 straight seasons, but his 6.3 rebounds per game this season is his most since 2021-22. Draymond Green is certainly not off to his best start, shooting just 39.1 percent from the field and 58.8 percent from the foul line. However, he continues to do a great job chipping in across the board, most notably by racking up assists with his high-IQ playmaking, a trait he has displayed for most of his career. While his 7.9 points and 5.8 rebounds are average for his position at best, his 5.7 assists per game are what set him apart from the bunch. The Warriors are a long way from their championship days, but Green still has his main target, Stephen Curry, who has surely been the one to finish many of the plays that led to assists for the big man. It is also likely that Green rediscovers his touch from the foul line, as this is the first time in his career that he is shooting below 65.0 percent from the stripe.  \nStat Stuffers of the FutureLuka Doncic continues to dominate the stat sheet. Leading with an incredible scoring touch and excellent passing. He also does a great job using his 6-foot-6 build to take his production to another level with impressive rebounding. Doncic is shooting 47.2 percent from the field through 11 appearances this season, and he is also averaging a career-best 1.9 steals per game. He is the type of player that could likely put up numbers on any team, but he is surrounded by a strong unit with the Lakers, where Austin Reaves provides great support to help relieve the pressure in the backcourt, while Deandre Ayton, and now, LeBron James, who just made his season debut, are ideal targets to feed for easy buckets in the frontcourt.  Jaime Jaquez turned heads with a hot start to the season, averaging 17.1 points, 6.9 rebounds and 5.1 assists in 30.3 minutes per game, exclusively out of a bench role. His production shows a major leap over his sophomore season, which was slightly underwhelming compared to his rookie year. Nonetheless, he is reaching new heights in his third campaign, including shooting a career-best 52.8 percent from the field. With his 6-foot-6 frame and passing ability, Jaquez has all the tools to continue to make an impact across the stat sheet. In the past, he has had trouble maintaining significant playingtime, but injuries in the Heat's lineup have allowed him to enjoy a worry-free start. On the other hand, Tyler Herro is on track to return to action in the next few weeks, which could cut into Jaquez's time, especially if he falls into any kind of slump.  Amen Thompson is averaging more than four assists per game for the first time in his three seasons. He is putting up career highs of 17.3 points and 5.2 assists per game, and he continues to make an impact on the glass with 6.1 rebounds per game despite working within a lineup filled with players that attack the boards. With the absence of Fred VanVleet, Thompson has been handling the starting point-guard job for the Rockets, which is proving to be an area that he is more than capable of managing and is surely contributing to his new levels of success. His shooting percentages have taken a slight dip compared to last season, but at 22 years old, he is more than likely to continue to develop his game in a positive direction, which would have him on track to be one of the league's best producers.  \nScottie Barnes is off to a dominant start, standing out as one of the league's most well-rounded volume contributors, averaging 19.4 points, 7.7 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.8 blocks, with just 1.9 turnovers in 32.7 minutes per game. He is surrounded by strong offensive players in the Raptors' lineup, but his skillset remains unique thanks to a great ability to battle and score in the paint. He is also shooting career-bests 50.2 percent from the field and 81.3 percent from the foul line, indicating that he is using more discretion and refining his approach with experience. Additionally, his size and determination make him a legitimate defensive force and suggest that he will continue to round out his production with contributions on both ends of the floor. Dyson Daniels has shown a significant drop in his points per game, going from 14.1 last season, down to 8.9 this season. However, he is also averaging career highs of 5.9 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game, as he has done a great job stepping up as a distributor in the absence of Trae Young. Daniels made a splash last season with his uncanny defensive ability, racking up a whopping 3.0 steals per game, and he is keeping up the good work on that end with 2.3 steals per game this season. However, he is shooting just 61.9 percent from the foul line, where he has yet to shoot better than 65.0 percent in his career, and he is shooting a career-low 23.1 percent from deep. Looking ahead, his assist numbers may take a hit when Young returns, which could make a notable impact on his overall productivity, especially if he does not get his shooting on track. Alperen Sengun has shown for a few seasons now that he is a certified stat-sheet stuffer, and he is at it again, averaging 23.0 points along with career highs of 10.3 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.0 blocks per game. His ability to show improvement nearly across the board is a testament to his own work ethic but also an indication that the arrival of Kevin Durant, and the current composition of the lineup is working in his favor. His dexterity, vision, and timing are rare skills at the center position, mirrored by only a few players, including Nikola Jokic, and Domantas Sabonis. These are skills that will ensure Sengun stays at the heart of the action and has a good chance of picking up stats on virtually every possession. \nOther players averaging at least 10.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists (these players have been highlighted within one of my previous three weekly articles):Nikola Jokic, Cade Cunningham, Josh Giddey, Jrue Holiday, Austin Reaves, Stephon Castle, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Jalen Johnson, Jamal Murray, Julius Randle.\n            ",

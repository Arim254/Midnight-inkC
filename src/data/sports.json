    "body": "\n        Gabriel Bonfim is more than a grappler. Heading into Saturday's UFC Fight Night, many thought Bonfim's submission skills would carry him to victory. Instead, he chewed up Randy Brown's leg before knocking him out with a brutal knee in the second round from Las Vegas.Bonfim systematically disassembled Brown, who was the more reputable striker. Bonfim immediately got to work, targeting Brown's lead leg with calf strikes. The damage added up quickly as Brown started switching stances and preemptively picking his leg up off the mat. What happened early in Round 2, however, sparked more dialogue than the good work preceding it.Bonfim landed a clinch knee that took him off his feet and  dropped Brown. Bonfim quickly stood up and ran over to deal additional  blows to his grounded opponent. Before he could, referee Mark Smith  intervened and waved it off. Brown protested the stoppage, but it's unlikely he would've fared better had the fight continued. \nUpon closer inspection, it appeared that Brown was knocked out and  awoke once he hit the mat. After Bonim landed the knee, Brown slowly  fell backwards, his head smacking against the mat. He looked dazed as he  slowly raised his hands to block Bonfim's inevitable incoming barrage.  \nPost-fight, Bonfim reflected on his performance before calling out former UFC welterweight title challenger Colby Covington.\"We knew the calf was something. We knew to punish that, and that the knee would show up,\" Bonfim said, according to Portuguese interpreter Fabiano Buskei. \"Colby, stop running. Stop running away. We are the Bonfim brothers. Give me the chance to knock you out of the rankings... I'm going to retire him.\"It was a bittersweet evening for the Bonfim brothers. While Gabriel scored one of his biggest wins to date, Ismael wasn't so lucky. \nChris Padilla knocked out the elder Bonfim brother after wearing him out. Gabriel Bonfim improved to 18-1 with a three-fight winning streak. Ismael Bonfim dropped to 20-5 and has lost three of his last four.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Will the ACC's best team please stand up? In fact, if you're out there, go ahead and give the College Football Playoff selection committee a nudge, too.No. 14 Virginia and No. 15 Louisville -- the league's two torchbearers in the first College Football Playoff Rankings -- lost on Saturday night to Wake Forest and Cal, respectively, sending the ACC Championship race into further disarray coming down the stretch. No. 17 Georgia Tech was idle following its first loss of the season at NC State, while No. 18th Miami handled Syracuse after previously tumbling outside of the top 10 after its second setback in three weeks.It was so disappointing for Louisville against Cal that a chorus of boos rained down from the Cardinals' home fans at the end of regulation after a possession that started at midfield in the final seconds of the fourth quarter went nowhere. In overtime, Louisville was called for a chop block on its first possession that wiped away a first down and led to a field goal before Cal won it on fourth-and-goal with a touchdown pass from freshman QB Jaron Keawe Sagapolutele.\nThe metrics point to the league being a mixed bag at best this season, punctuated by a 5-4 Duke team -- a 37-34 loser at UConn in Week 11 -- still having a chance to reach the league title game with a couple wins the remainder of the month.How'd we get here after Florida State opened with a win over Alabama and Clemson outlasted LSU to spike the early top 15 before the wheels came off for both?The selection committee slotted three Big 12 teams ahead of the ACC's first ranked team in this week's initial poll and placed two-loss Notre Dame, who fell to Miami in the season opener, eight spots ahead of the Hurricanes despite having the same record.\nIt's clear the selection committee is not fond of the ACC this season. And this should not be surprising.There's five automatic qualifiers in the 12-team playoff bracket -- the five, highest-ranked conference champions based on the selection committee's final top 25. Theoretically, if there's a Group of Five team -- or multiple squads -- slotted higher than the ACC's victor at season's end, they would get in along with champions from the SEC, Big Ten and Big 12.Virginia's strength of schedule coming into Saturday's loss to Wake Forest was 85th nationally, just behind Georgia Tech. Louisville's slate was 56th and Miami's was considered the best in the conference at No. 28. The Hurricanes also rank seventh in game control following their win over Syracuse, but they're too far back of the current pack at No. 18 in the rankings.\nBy comparison, all seven SEC teams still in playoff contention rank 25th or better in strength of schedule and in the Big Ten, the strength of schedules average for the six teams expected to be ranked on Tuesday is 35.1.Say what you want, but who you play matters and strength of schedule is supposed to matter more this season than it ever has in the eyes of the selection committee.The argument's easy for another addition from the SEC or Big Ten taking the ACC's perceived one-bid lock, but SOS is a dilemma for those in the Group of Five. There's currently six teams vying for the Group of Five's playoff auto-bid -- North Texas, Navy, USF, Tulane, James Madison and San Diego State. \nNone of these teams were ranked by the selection committee in the first poll, but one could justify a 12-win, Sun Belt champion JMU or a 12-win, Mountain West champion San Diego State as a better option than what the ACC could end up with at the podium in Charlotte the first weekend of December. JMU would be riding an 11-game winning streak with its only loss coming at Louisville in Week 2, while San Diego State would also have a comparable streak, including victories over five bowl-bound opponents if the Aztecs win out.Top of ACC standings after Week 11TEAMRECORDNo. 14 Virginia8-2, 5-1 (85th SOS)No. 17 Georgia Tech8-1, 5-1 (84th)No. 24 Pittsburgh7-2, 5-1 (86th)SMU7-3, 5-1 (64th)Duke5-4, 4-1 (70th)No. 15 Louisville7-2, 4-2 (56th)No. 18 Miami (FL)7-2, 3-2 (28th)Virginia has three overtime wins this season over Florida State, Louisville and North Carolina. And that's part of what apparently made the resume stand out above others in the conference to the selection committee last week.\"Look, if you win, it's a positive. Wins matter. And if you lose, we evaluate what type of loss that is,\" selection committee chair Mack Rhoades said last week. \"Again, Virginia, that's a great overtime win, when you talk about going on the road and beating a quality -- a really well-coached Louisville team. Virginia is a really good football team. Coach Scott has done a great job. Again, they've got more games to play.\"Georgia Tech could close the book on any noise concerning the ACC being deserving of a bid or not to its champion if the Yellow Jackets run the table. That would include victories over two ranked teams in Pitt and Georgia, and likely another top-25 team in the league title game.If Brent Key's team gets through that gauntlet, they're going to be in the bracket and perhaps even receive a first-round home game. What's more likely is more unpredictability in the conference through the end of the month with perceived favorites going down and there being a multi-team tie at the top with multiple losses going into the final weekend of the campaign.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the biggest surprises in the new era of name, image, and likeness occurred less than 30 minutes before the deadline to withdraw from the 2025 NBA Draft passed. Alabama guard Labaron Philon, who most considered a likely late-first-round pick, elected to withdraw from the draft process during the 11th hour to return to school.Philon coming back not only gave Alabama a true building block for the 2025-26 season but also a chance for him to raise his stock and solidify himself as \"the guy\" after All-American guard Mark Sears departed the program. If Saturday was any indication of what's to come this season for the Crimson Tide, it is that Philon appears to be ready to meet the moment. Philon scored 25 points in No. 15 Alabama's 103-96 upset win over No. 5 St. John's at Madison Square Garden. Fifteen of his 25 points came after halftime. The Alabama star finished 10 of 17 from the floor and dished out three assists in just 29 minutes while dealing with foul trouble.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: North Carolina ticks up in Top 25 And 1 as Caleb Wilson stars in win over Kansas\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHighlight to end the halfPerhaps one of the biggest shots of Philon's college career came in the final two minutes of regulation. With the Crimson Tide up seven, Philon knocked down a step-back 3-pointer to extend the lead to double-digits, which put the game away for good. St. John's trailed for a majority of the second half before storming back to take a brief lead with 6:09 remaining.\nPhilon showed flashes last season of why he was one of the best prospects in the 2024 recruiting cycle. He averaged 10.6 points, 3.8 assists and 3.3 rebounds in 37 games. However, Philon started just 29 games and took a backseat role at times to other players on the roster, including Sears and Grant Nelson -- who both averaged more points per game than Philon.\nOats rescues roster againSince Nate Oats arrived at Alabama in 2019, he has consistently retooled his rosters. Oats had to replace three assistant coaches and seven of his top nine scorers ahead of the 2023-24 season when the Crimson Tide reached the Final Four for the first time in program history. Perhaps this offseason was one of his toughest challenges yet, as it's hard to replace a player like Sears, who is one of the most accomplished in program history.But getting Philon back was one of the biggest wins of Oats' coaching career, and it should give the Crimson Tide a real chance to compete for another berth to the Final Four if he keeps playing like this. As of this weekend, Alabama had the 10th-best odds (+430), per FanDuel, to reach the Final Four.\nOats has traditionally scheduled a tough slate of preseason games since his arrival to Tuscaloosa. Last year, the Crimson Tide played Purdue, Illinois, Houston, Oregon and North Carolina before SEC play began. Alabama will face No. 1 Purdue on Thursday with games vs. Illinois, Gonzaga and Arizona in nonconference play before the calendar flips to the new year and SEC play begins.    This win over St. John's should signal a few things ahead of his team's upcoming gauntlet: Alabama is still in the mix among the best teams in the sport, and Philon has a real case to leave his mark on the program and solidify himself as a potential lottery pick this summer.\n    \n                                        \n    Bama247.com features the best team and recruiting coverage of the Crimson Tide in the Alabama market.

    "body": "\n        LSU interim coach Frank Harris benched veteran quarterback Garrett Nussmeier in the third quarter of the Tigers' game at No. 4 Alabama on Saturday night. The hook came amid continued struggles for LSU's offense as the Tigers trailed 17-6 when backup Michael Van Buren Jr. entered.Nussmeier started 9 for 9, but his hot start fizzled amid more sloppy play from the LSU offensive line. Alabama frequently dropped seven or eight men in coverage against the Tigers, who have struggled to run the football all season. Even with a minimal pass rush, Bama was able to make Nussmeier uncomfortable.Harris, in his first game as the interim coach following Brian Kelly's firing, pulled Nussmeier after he took a 14-yard sack that backed LSU out of the red zone. A couple of three-and-outs preceded that big loss, and Harris was seen lighting into Nussmeier on the sideline after one unproductive series.Van Buren garnered significant playing time as a freshman at Mississippi State last season before transferring to LSU as a potential heir to Nussmeier. The idea of Van Buren supplanting Nussmeier for any reason aside from injury in the 2025 campaign would have been viewed as far-fetched entering the season. But Nussmeier has been underwhelming after throwing for 4,052 yards last season, and LSU has nothing to lose at this juncture.\nThe Tigers play home games against Arkansas and Western Kentucky this before traveling to No. 11 Oklahoma to close the regular season.Serious opportunity for Michael Van Buren Jr.Van Buren entered late in the fourth quarter of LSU's 49-25 loss at Texas A&M two weeks ago, but Saturday's circumstances were significantly different. Against the Aggies, the game was out of reach when Van Buren got the nod. On Saturday, the Tigers remained within striking distance with over a quarter left to play when they made the change. It was Van Buren's most substantive game action since he completed 10 of 12 passes in a blowout victory over LSU on Sept. 20.\nRedshirt question for Van BurenVan Buren can appear in up to four regular-season games before losing his chance to claim 2025 as a redshirt campaign. Saturday's appearance was his third. That creates an interesting dynamic for Van Buren and LSU's interim staff to navigate. If they think he's their best option for the final three games, that would require both parties to be willing to sacrifice the possibility of a redshirt. In this era, eligibility is money. However, potentially getting the chance to start the season's final three games would allow Van Buren to increase his value.Nussmeier's complicated legacyNussmeier would likely have been drafted last year if he'd opted to forego his final season of eligibility. His decision to return was celebrated by LSU fans and the staff. He was viewed as a Heisman Trophy contender and as a likely beneficiary of LSU's improved defense. While the Tigers have improved defensively in 2025, their offensive line and rushing attack have been nonexistent. \nThose glaring deficiencies left the fairly immobile Nussmeier with no choice but to play \"hero ball\" on many occasions. Consequently, he often appears unsettled and jittery in the pocket. On a few occasions against Alabama, he missed open receivers or didn't get his feet set before making throws. Such scenes have become the norm for Nussmeier in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At 27 years old and with 23 professional fights on his resume, it's fair to ask if Vergil Ortiz still qualifies as a prospect. On Saturday, Ortiz will attempt to move further from prospect and closer to world champion when he faces former title challenger Erickson Lubin.Saturday's fight continues a run of Ortiz fights against tough opposition that began after muscle disorder rhabdomyolysis sidelined him from August 2022 to January 2024. Prior to that time on the sidelines, Ortiz was a red-hot up-and-comer, racking up tertiary titles at welterweight while struggling to find elite opponents.After Ortiz returned to action, he campaigned at 154 pounds, and after shaking off ring rust with first-round knockouts of Fredrick Lawson and Thomas Dulorme, Ortiz began to fight the kind of tricky opponents who are often avoided by fighters looking to climb their way to a title shot.\n        \n            \n                Vergil Ortiz Jr. faces another tough challenge in Erickson Lubin as champions continue to avoid him\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFirst was Serhii Bohachuk, who entered the fight after defeating Brian Mendoza. Ortiz was truly tested for the first time in his career in that fight, suffering two knockdowns but battling back to earn a majority decision victory.\nOrtiz followed the win over Bohachuk with a fight against Israil Madrimov, who gave Terence Crawford all he could handle one fight prior, losing a narrow decision to the elite pound-for-pound mainstay. Ortiz took a few rounds to work out Madrimov's awkward style, but ultimately took a decision win by wider margins than Crawford had managed.Lubin continues Ortiz's attempt to make his first shot at a world championship undeniable. Only two men have defeated Lubin as a professional: Jermell Charlo and Sebastian Fundora, both fighters who have held world championships. The fight with Fundora was a contender for Fight of the Year in 2022.Lubin has not been active in recent years. Since a somewhat controversial decision over Jesus Ramos in 2023, Lubin has only fought once, beating Ardreal Holmes Jr. in May.\nWith a win over Lubin, a title shot should be more or less guaranteed for Ortiz. The Ortiz team was already gunning for a shot at WBO champ Xander Zayas when negotiations never got over the finish line, leading to the Lubin fight. Zayas is now reportedly set to face WBA titlist Abass Baraou in a Jan. 31 unification bout. The timing could work out for Ortiz to get a shot at whoever emerges as unified champion sometime in mid-2026.The undercard is a bit weak on Saturday night. There are some matchups in the middleweight and super middleweight ranks featuring fighters looking to make a move up the divisional ranks. Darius Fulghum is set to take on David Stevens at 168 pounds. Fulghum suffered his first pro defeat in his last outing in May against Bektemir Melikuziev. Prior to that Fulghum won the first 14 bouts of his career. Plus, cruiserweights are set to throw down when Robin Sirwan Safar takes on Derick Miller Jr. Safar is a top prospect in the 200-pound division with an undefeated record at 18-0 with 13 KOs. He picked up the biggest win of his career in May 2024 with a decision over former light heavyweight king Sergey Kovalev.Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nOrtiz vs. Lubin fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookVergil Ortiz Jr. -1000 vs. Erickson Lubin +600, junior middleweightsDarius Fulghum -500 vs. David Stevens +350, super middleweightsRobin Sirwan Safar -700 vs. Derick Miller Jr. +425, cruiserweightsEric Priest -3500 vs. Esneiker Correa +1300, middleweightsAmari Jones -2500 vs. Shady Gamhour +1100, middleweightsOrtiz vs. Lubin viewing informationDate: Nov. 8 | Location: Dickies Arena -- Fort Worth, TexasStart time: 8 p.m. ET (main event ringwalks approximately 11:30 p.m. ET)Where to watch: DAZN (subscription required)PredictionLubin is a legit opponent for Ortiz, with good power and skills. Ortiz is, however, the better fighter overall. The past two fights have shown new dimensions to Ortiz while answering a lot of questions. Ortiz showed he can get up off the canvas and continue to fight for the win, not just to survive, against Bohachuk. And Ortiz proved he can handle a slick, awkward boxer against Madrimov.Lubin has enough power in both hands that he could score a knockout, but Ortiz can return fire and is the better boxer. This is all to say that Ortiz is a -1000 favorite for a reason.Lubin was stopped by both Charlo and Fundora. Though Ortiz has gone to decision in his two most recent fights (the only fights in his career to go the distance), this is the kind of fight where he can get back to stopping opponents. Pick: Vergil Ortiz via TKO8\n            ",

Bijan Robinson will get his for the Falcons, but I think the Colts -- who traded for corner Sauce Gardner this week -- will handle the Falcons run game better. Pick: Colts 30, Falcons 23 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookBaltimore Ravens at Minnesota Vikings (+4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nBoth of these teams got much-needed victories last week with the Vikings really impressing in beating the Lions on the road. The Ravens came to life at Miami and I think that will carry over here. Brian Flores will challenge Lamar Jackson in a big way with his schemes, but I think Jackson will get the best of him with his legs and his arm.  Ravens take it. Pick: Ravens 27, Vikings 20 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookBuffalo Bills (-9.5) at Miami DolphinsSunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Bills are coming off an emotional victory over the Chiefs, while the Dolphins suffered another bad loss to the Ravens last Thursday. This could be a spot for a letdown, but the Bills have owned the Dolphins in recent years, especially Josh Allen. That won't change here as the Bills avoid a letdown. Bills big.Pick: Bills 34, Dolphins 19 | Odds via BetMGMCleveland Browns at New York Jets (-1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is one of the dog games of the week, featuring two teams coming off a bye. Both needed it. Both teams have quarterback issues, but at least the Browns have the better defense. The Jets traded away captains Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams this week. That won't play well. I think the Browns win it behind their defense. Pick: Browns 21, Jets 17 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20X:Jacksonville Jaguars at Houston Texans (-1.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Jaguars are banged up in a lot of spots, but the Texans might not have C.J. Stroud, who is in the concussion protocol. The Jaguars are playing consecutive road games, which is tough. This is a tough pick because of all the injuries, but I will go with the Texans behind their defense because I think Stroud will play.   Pick: Texans 23, Jaguars 17 | Odds via BetMGMNew England Patriots at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-2.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is the best game of the week, with both teams legitimate Super Bowl contenders. The Bucs are coming off a bye, which they needed. They are getting healthier. It's also nice to be at home. Baker Mayfield will outplay Drake Maye to win it as the Bucs snap the Patriots' winning streak. Pick: Bucs 30, Patriots 24 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookNew Orleans Saints at Carolina Panthers (-5.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Saints are playing consecutive road games against a physical Panthers team. The defense will be a challenge for Tyler Shough, who will be making his second start. Carolina will continue to run the ball to eat clock and move the chains. I think that's good enough in a low-scoring game. Pick: Panthers 21, Saints 10 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookNew York Giants at Chicago Bears (-3.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Giants are struggling, while the Bears are playing good football. The Bears have played well on offense, while the Giants defense hasn't come close to living up to the hype. Look for Ben Johnson and the offense to have another big game as the Giants continue to struggle. Pick: Bears 33, Giants 17 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookArizona Cardinals at Seattle Seahawks (-6.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Seahawks are playing as well as any team in the league and have a dominant defense and a big-play offense. Arizona is playing consecutive road games on a short week, which is tough. They are also keeping Jacoby Brissett in at quarterback. They should. He will keep it close.  Pick: Seahawks 23, Cardinals 20 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookDetroit Lions (-8.5) at Washington CommandersSunday, 4:25 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Commanders will be without quarterback Jayden Daniels, which means Marcus Mariota starts. That's not their biggest issue. The defense is bad. The Lions weren't as good on offense last week in the loss to the Vikings, but that will change here. Jared Goff will light up the Commanders.  Pick: Lions 35, Commanders 23 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookLos Angeles Rams (-3.5) at San Francisco 49ersSunday, 4:25 p.m. on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is an enormous NFC West game in a tight division race. The 49ers have played well with Mac Jones playing, but Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is on fire. It will be a challenge for the undermanned 49ers defense to slow the Rams. But I think they show up and play well. It's close. Pick: Rams 26, 49ers 24 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookPittsburgh Steelers at Los Angeles Chargers (-3)Sunday, 8:20 p.m. on NBC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThese two are coming off victories with the Steelers really impressing in beating up the Colts. The defense came alive in that one. With the Chargers losing tackle Joe Alt, that could be a problem for Justin Herbert. But I think he will play well enough to find a way to win this at home.       Pick: Chargers 29, Steelers 23 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookPhiladelphia Eagles at Green Bay Packers (-2.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Packers were stunned last week in losing at home to Carolina, while the Eagles are coming off a bye. The Packers had to be looking ahead to this game. They played like it. I think they get back on track and play much better. They tend to play better against good teams. Jordan Love wins it with a late touchdown pass.   Pick: Packers 30, Eagles 27 | Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On a college football weekend that brought plenty of losses for ranked teams, some of the most impactful results were the close calls that went the way of the favorites on a nervy Week 11 Saturday. Indiana and Oregon both faced late deficits on the road but emerged victorious, preserving their top-10 status and adding to what should be a mostly calm week-to-week adjustment for voters in the AP Top 25 poll. But should that be the case? Texas A&M went on the road as well, but unlike Indiana and Oregon, the Aggies did not trail late. In fact, they never tailed at all. Mike Elko's group came out of the off week with an 8-0 record and handled business the way that title contenders do -- by grabbing control of the game early and never letting go. Every time Missouri found a little bit of spark, the Aggies had a response, and now as we head into the final stretch of the regular season, it's worth considering whether Texas A&M is more deserving of consideration for the No. 1 spot. Last week's voting had Ohio State as the rock-solid No. 1 team in the AP Top 25 poll with 55 first-place votes and 1,633 voting points. Indiana had the second-most first-place votes with 11, but the 1,591 voting points was closer to No. 1 than it was to No. 3, where Texas A&M checked in with just one first-place vote and 1,523 voting points. The Buckeyes aren't likely to be displaced from No. 1, but on a weekend where Indiana faced getting knocked off by an interim coach, it's worth considering whether Texas A&M has an argument for moving up in the rankings. At the very least it seems certain that the Aggies will cut into the gap with the two teams at the top, and that instead of a debate for No. 1 the voting points will entertain a debate for No. 2 heading into Week 12. \n\n        \n            \n                Bowl projections: Texas Tech replaces BYU in College Football Playoff bracket, Oregon avoids chaos\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFurther down in the rankings, outside the top 10, we are projecting a good bit of chaos with Virginia, Louisville and Washington all taking unexpected losses. Also, with this being the first set of AP rankings since the College Football Playoff Selection Committee released its top 25, we will be monitoring the cat-and-mouse game between the voters and the committee. The selection committee made some choices -- like ranking Pitt and Iowa or putting Texas ahead of Oklahoma -- that did not align with the AP voters, and now we will see if there's a reaction.  Here's how we project the new AP Top 25 poll to look on Sunday after the results from Week 11 in college football: 1. Ohio State (Last week — 1): No change at the top of the rankings for the Buckeyes, who got a huge day from Jeremiah Smith (10 catches, 137 yards, one touchdown) as the highlight of a 24-point road win at Purdue. Next step for Ohio State is a two-game home stand against UCLA and Rutgers before the regular-season finale at rival Michigan in Ann Arbor. \n2. Indiana (2): The Hoosiers may have looked more human with their near-upset on the road at Penn State, but the team also looks heroic following the Heisman moment from Fernando Mendoza with the game-winning touchdown to Omar Cooper, who himself has an argument for catch of the year. A few ballots could entertain swapping Indiana for Texas A&M, but we're projecting it won't be enough of a consensus opinion to lead to a change in the rankings. 3. Texas A&M (3): There will be some momentum and a legitimate argument for Texas A&M as the No. 1 team in the country following a 21-point road win against ranked Missouri. The Aggies are now 9-0 and have a win against Notre Dame to pair with six SEC victories, giving strength to the argument for some upward movement in the rankings. The issue is displacing either the No. 1 or No. 2 team after a weekend of wins. The Aggies will cut into the voting points deficit, for sure, but we're projecting it's not enough for a swap at the top. 4. Alabama (4): No major changes in the rankings for Alabama after a lower-scoring win against LSU. The Crimson Tide are 8-1 on the year and 6-0 in SEC play, but the path to Atlanta includes some tricky spots left that include a showdown with Oklahoma next week and the Iron Bowl at the end of the season at Auburn.  \n5. Georgia (5): There are head-to-head results that have Georgia pinned into a pretty specific spot in the rankings, but it's hard not to see this stock price going up following a 20-point win on the road at Mississippi State. Kirby Smart's team caught the upset-minded Bulldogs between playing Florida and Texas yet showed up in Starkville with hammers ready to impose their will.  6. Oregon (6): Beating Iowa at its own game will remain a cornerstone in Oregon's 2025 campaign, as the Ducks had to rally with a handful of key offensive contributors out of the lineup and find ways to win in the rain in Kinnick Stadium. Escaping Iowa City with a win is a victory that keeps all of Oregon's big-picture goals on track, but it won't move the needle in terms of a shakeup in the rankings given results elsewhere.  7. Ole Miss (7): Voters won't react too much one way or the other after a 49-0 win against The Citadel. Up next for the Rebels is the home finale against Florida next Saturday night, followed by a week off and then the Egg Bowl on Nov. 28 to close out the regular season. \n8. Texas Tech (9): We are projecting a slight bump up for the Red Raiders following an impressive win against a top-10 opponent, handing BYU its first loss of the season by a 22-point margin. The Red Raiders could jump Ole Miss as well, but last week's balloting had a significant enough gap between those two teams to think a swap is in order after a pair of wins. 9. Notre Dame (10): No major changes after Notre Dame bowled over Navy. The Fighting Irish have now won seven straight games and continue to show little in terms of wavering form as the pressure mounts with each week to win or face falling out of the playoff picture. 10. Texas (13): The Longhorns were off in Week 11 and will be back in action next week at Georgia. As we mentioned earlier, our projection for a move up is one of the few spots where the AP voters could tail the committee's actions. Texas and Oklahoma were separated by just 15 voting points last week, and since both are 7-2 and the CFP committee put the Longhorns ahead, we're projecting the AP voters to follow suit. \n11. Oklahoma (11): The Sooners were off in Week 11 and will be back in action at Alabama next Saturday. 12. Vanderbilt (15): Trailing by double digits at home, Vanderbilt turned to Diego Pavia to help keep the Commodores' postseason hopes alive and he delivered. Pavia finished with 377 yards passing, 112 yards rushing and four total touchdowns in the 45-38 overtime win against Auburn to help Vanderbilt improve to 8-2 on the season.   13. Georgia Tech (16): The Yellow Jackets were off in Week 11 and will be back in action next week at Boston College. \n14. BYU (8): There is an easy spot to project for BYU's drop after the loss, because while the Cougars were arguably undervalued as an undefeated team outside the top five, they do have a key head-to-head win against another top-20 team in Utah. It's possible the respect for Texas Tech and the quality loss leaves BYU as high as No. 12, but for now, we'll project it's an easy slide into the slot above the Utes for most voters. 15. Utah (17): The Utes were off in Week 11 and will be back in action next week at Baylor. 16. Miami (18): A slow start against Syracuse seemed to spell doom for a Hurricanes squad that needed a spark, and maybe they found it with Carson Beck's touchdown reception. Miami poured it on late and ultimately won by 28 points to keep their spot in the top 25.  \n17. USC (20): Friday night saw the Trojans handle business against Northwestern, tightening up after a loose start and pulling away for a 38-17 win. Now at 7-2 with a win over Michigan, the Trojans have a path to more upward movement with games against Iowa and Oregon in the coming weeks. 18. Michigan (21): The Wolverines were off in Week 11 and will be back in action next week at Northwestern. 19. Tennessee (23): The Vols were off in Week 11 and will be back in action next week against New Mexico State. \n20. Cincinnati (25): The Bearcats were off in Week 11 and will be back in action next week against Arizona. 21. Tulane (NR): The Green Wave bounced back from a stunning double-digit loss at UTSA with a strong performance taking down Memphis on the road. Now at 7-2 overall, Tulane has a complex resume with a 2-1 record against power conference opponents, a ranked win (at Memphis) and one bad loss. Making the American title game, which is the key to making the College Football Playoff, is much more likely after the win against the Tigers. Now will the AP voters note that and make a G5 swap on their ballots? It's certainly possible. 22. James Madison (NR): Look for the College Football Playoff race to get another contender when it comes to potential conference champions, because JMU is now 8-1 overall and 6-0 in conference play after a 12-point road win against Marshall. If the Dukes win out and claim the Sun Belt title, they'll be a 12-1 team with the only loss coming to Louisville. What's left are home dates against App State and Washington State followed the regular-season finale at Coastal Carolina. \n23. Pittsburgh (NR): The Panthers were off in Week 11 but were 28th in last week's balloting and showed up in the College Football Playoff Rankings as one of the top 25 teams in the country, according to the selection committee. That could bring a spotlight that wouldn't otherwise be on Pitt during an off week, and when looking for two-loss teams to consider, the Panthers have a solid argument.   24. Houston (NR): The Cougars were just inside the top 25 two weeks ago before a stunning loss to West Virginia, so it's not going to be a far reach to see voters grab a team when looking for options in the 20s. Houston doesn't have many great wins, it is 8-2 after winning in Week 11 at UCF and one of those losses came to a Texas Tech team who will be moving up on voters' ballots. 25. South Florida (NR): Does USF have a loss to a Memphis team that we are projecting to fall out of the rankings? Yes. But the Bulls are also 8-2 and coming off a 55-23 runaway win against the same UTSA team that just beat Tulane. The American continues to provide a grab bag of options for one-loss and two-loss teams worth consideration, but here the Bulls have an impressive score on a Thursday night stage to keep the team top of mind for voters.   Projected to drop out: No. 12 Virginia, No. 14 Louisville, No. 19 Missouri, No. 22 Memphis, No. 24 Washington \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Fernando Mendoza is back in the driver's seat on the road to the Heisman Trophy. The Indiana quarterback delivered a game-winning drive for the ages in the Hoosiers' electric 27-24 win at Penn State and in turn climbed back into betting favorite status in the award race.Indiana's undefeated season was in extreme peril in the fourth quarter of the road trip to Beaver Stadium. A loss to a reeling Penn State team would have taken the Hoosiers out of full control of their Big Ten championship destiny. It was for moments like this why Curt Cignetti hand-picked Mendoza as his quarterback of choice in the transfer portal. And, man, did he prove worthy of every cent of NIL money it took to bring him to Bloomington.Trailing by four with 1:51 to play and no timeouts in his back pocket, Mendoza bounced back from a drive-opening sack and picked apart the Nittany Lions over the course of a clutch, 80-yard march down the field. He eventually hit Omar Cooper Jr. in the back of the end zone for his first touchdown pass of the day and one of the most eye-catching completions of the college football season.Cooper's remarkable play on the ball was a landmark moment in his star teammate's Heisman campaign.\nWhile he was far from his best for much of the day against a Penn State defense stacked with NFL talent, Mendoza elevated to prime form when the Hoosiers needed a hero. Over the first nine drives of the game, he was a modest 14-of-22 passing for 131 yards with an interception. With Indiana needing a touchdown, he went 5 of 8 for 87 yards and the game-winning strike.\nHeisman Trophy oddsOdds below via FanDuel Sportsbook. PlayerTeamOddsFernando MendozaIndiana+150Julian SayinOhio State+200Ty SimpsonAlabama+470Marcel ReedTexas A&M+850Gunner StocktonGeorgia+2000Jeremiah SmithOhio State+2500\"Late in the game, I threw a pick,\" Mendoza said postgame. \"That's on me. The team still had belief. The defense had belief. The special teams had belief. [Cooper] believed. He was open, I missed him a couple times, but it all came around in the end with the glory of God and with such amazing teammates and coaches. We were able to rally and get the win here in an awesome environment against a great team.\"Mendoza has been in favorable positions in the Heisman race effectively all season. This is not his first time as the betting favorite, but it could be his last. Such a campaign-defining statement this late in the season may be all it takes to launch Mendoza in front of Alabama's Ty Simpson, Ohio State's Julian Sayin and the other contenders for good.Mendoza already had the season-long numbers necessary to contend for the Heisman. Now, he has the signature moment. The junior entered the day with a Big Ten-leading 25 touchdowns on the year, a sparkling 72.3% completion rate, one of the most efficient stat lines in the nation and a perfect record.\nHe closed the afternoon with a string of plays that will endure in Indiana football lore for years to come.\n            ",

We're still waiting for the offseason's first significant move, but now that qualifying offers have been issued, that should come soon. Here are the latest hot stove nuggets now that Munetaka Murakami has been posted for MLB teams.   Blue Jays want to re-sign Bichette \nNot surprisingly, the Blue Jays want to re-sign star shortstop Bo Bichette, GM Ross Atkins told reporters (via Sportsnet). Atkins added that Toronto has a \"good bit of versatility\" on its infield in case Bichette signs elsewhere. We ranked Bichette as the third best free agent available this offseason and project him to receive a seven-year contract worth $189 million. The Blue Jays could play Andrés Giménez at short, Addison Barger at third, and Ernie Clement at second should Bichette leave, though they would be losing a significant bat and a beloved homegrown player. Still only 27, Bichette is one of the youngest free agents on the market this offseason. He posted a 120 OPS+ for the sixth time in seven MLB seasons in 2025. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     \tPadres expected to extend Preller Padres POBO A.J. Preller is expected to sign a contract extension in the coming days, reports The Athletic. San Diego will introduce new manager Craig Stammen at a press conference Monday and Preller's extension should be finalized by then. Preller, 48, has been the club's lead baseball operations executive since August 2014. The Padres have been to the postseason four times in the last six seasons after reaching the postseason five times in the franchise's first 51 years. \n \tBraves re-sign Carrasco \nThe Braves have re-signed veteran righty Carlos Carrasco to a minor-league contract, according to Baseball America. Now 38, Carrasco made three ineffective starts for Atlanta this past season after beginning the year with the Yankees. He is far removed from his prime -- Carrasco has a 5.50 ERA since 2021 -- though the Braves continue to value him as a depth starter, and Carrasco wants to continue playing, so the two sides reunited early this offseason. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In a quarterfinal being billed as an upset watch, the second seeded Washington Spirit flipped the script advancing to the semifinals after penalty kicks. Against the backdrop of a raucous hometown crowd at Audi Field in Washington, D.C., the Spirit managed to take control of the match early. In the first half of regulation, Louisville had no real answers to the Spirit's ball progression and often had none against their territorial counterpress. Racing spent the majority of the game pinned in their own half, and almost faced an early deficit, but a nifty set-piece goal by the Spirit was ruled offside, and an injury substitution to Spirit defender Gabby Carle almost reset the tempo, but not nearly enough. Still, Washington was dominant in almost every offensive and attacking stat by halftime, including possession, 73% to Louisville's minimal 27%, and practically double the pass attempts (302 to 109) and total touches (405 to 202).The shot selection for both sides was questionable though, and it took them a long time to find a goal in regulation with the Spirit's Gift Monday finally breaking the deadlock on a header.\nIt looked like that was going to be all that the Spirit needed, as they nursed their lead into stoppage time. But the drama was only getting started. Racing substitute Kayla Fischer provided a huge lift for Louisville, scoring the equalizer in stoppage time of regulation.\nExtra time offered plenty of high drama as the Spirit's injury list grew deeper into the game. Washington defender and U.S. women's national team player Tara McKeown was subbed out after making what may have been a game-saving tackle on Racing star striker Emma Sears. Eventually, the tired legs and fatigue led the way for penalty heroics. Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury emerged as the game-changer, stopping three consecutive penalty attempts by Racing Louisville players. It was almost how Washington drew up from last season. The group faced a testy No. 7 seed last year in Bay FC, came out victorious, and rode the momentum through to the final.\"Honestly, we've worked on this. We're prepared. Our kickers all executed. I did my job, and we're through in another round,\" Kingsbury told the broadcast after the game.\n\"You know, we'd love to get out of there at the end of regulation, but we came back from early injury to Gabby [Carle], late injury to Tara [McKeown]. A lot of adversity today, but really proud of the way that we stuck through it and came out with a victory.\"You could definitely tell we were tired. They were also really tired. They defended very well, honestly, the whole game, and we really executed perfectly up until about that 93rd minute. So, it's like, 'Hey, we're doing well, just keep fighting. Dig deep.' Credit to our subs off the bench, everyone really put in the shift today.\"Washington Spirit will face the winner of Portland Thorns FC and San Diego Wave FC. The two sides will play on Sunday. The winner will travel to Audi Field for the semifinal, where the stadium has become a fortress-like atmosphere.\n\"Oh yeah, it's great. We love our fans. It's electric in here. I honestly feel invincible, especially getting to take those penalties in front of our supporters section,\" Kingsbury said.\"I knew we were going to win just because we had them, and just giving us confidence. And it's a tough place to play for the opponents. So yeah, I wouldn't want to be the goalkeeper in front of that.\"CBS is the home of the NWSL Championship. The last two teams remaining from the NWSL playoffs will compete for the title on Saturday, Nov. 22, at PayPal Park in San Jose, California. Orlando Pride are recent semifinalists after defeating Seattle Reign on Friday; they await the winner of Kansas City Current vs. Gotham FC. You can watch the final live on Paramount+.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Stadium of Light is becoming one of the toughest places to play in the Premier League, as Arsenal drew 2-2 against Sunderland on Saturday. After 10 consecutive wins to start the season, it's the first dropped points for Mikel Arteta's team, while Sunderland are trying to ride stoppage time magic to a European place. When Brian Brobbey scored with an acrobatic kick in the 94th minute of play, the roof almost came off the stadium, although late goals have been a normal occurrence for the cardiac Black Cats.\nThis is the third time this season that Sunderland have scored a result-changing goal in stoppage time and their league-leading fifth goal after the 90th minute, which leads the Premier League. They're also one of three teams to not concede a goal after the 90th minute of play, alongside Everton and Aston Villa. Sunderland will never count themselves out of a game, and with Arsenal youth product  Daniel Ballard in the middle of everything, why should they?The Northern Irish international filled the stat sheet with a goal, an assist, and a game-saving block off the line to end the game in what is the stuff dreams are made of for a center back. The Black Cats have been far from an average promoted side as they're pushing for a European place and trying to become the first newly promoted side to finish in the top half since Leeds United in the 2020-21 season.Without Viktor Gyokeres, Arsenal struggled to break down Sunderland's stout defense, but they thought that with moments of brilliance from Bukayo Saka and Trossard, they had found just enough space to earn all three points. Taking most of their shots from low percentage areas, despite Arsenal creating 2.07 xG during the match, most of it came from only two shots, with Mikel Merino and Riccardo Calafiori creating chances in stoppage time, chasing the game.\nFor much of the match, despite Arsenal dictating the tempo, Sunderland were dictating where the shots came from. They paid for it a few times, like Trossard scoring in the 74th minute with a rocket from outside the box that Robin Roefs had no chance of saving, but the majority were shots without consequence. During the grind of the season, these things will happen, but they show how hard it is to go wire to wire to win the Premier League. With Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, and Gyokeres all sidelined, Arsenal can't conjure a striker out of thin air, but on the bright side, Gyokeres should return from the international break to lead the line.With Liverpool and Manchester City facing each other on Sunday, this is a chance for one to draw closer to the Gunners, who now have a seven-point lead atop the league. A City win would close that to four points, while a Liverpool one would see it only drop to five. Both of those are manageable cushions, but City winning would truly signal that the game is back on in the Premier League title race.\nLast season, the Gunners got plenty out of Merino as an emergency center forward, but this was a stark reminder of how unsustainable that is. Heading into the international break will be a chance to reset for Arsenal because when it comes down to it, this could've been worse than a draw, and they did show resolve to go ahead, but Gyokeres was signed to bring a title, and they'll need him on the pitch to realize those ambitions. Meanwhile, Sunderland can begin dreaming of ambitions greater than just avoiding relegation in their emphatic return to the Premier League.\n            ",

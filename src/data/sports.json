Our computer model and experts will weigh in on all of the biggest events every day, and they're offering their top sports betting picks right now.Tuesday NBA best bets Game: Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Houston Rockets (7:35 p.m. ET)The Pick: Oklahoma City -7 (-106)The Thunder's 68 wins last season tied for the fifth-most in NBA history and they set a new league record for season-long point differential. They'll look to run it back this season with a largely unchanged roster, but will be without all-star Jalen Williams (wrist) on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Rockets made a splashy move this offseason by trading for Kevin Durant and are hoping to move into title contention, but it might take a while for the veteran to gel with Houston's young roster. The model predicts that Oklahoma City covers the spread in 71% of simulations.Bet Thunder vs. Rockets at FanDuel, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:More NBA best betsEvery NBA game simulated 10,000 timesTuesday UEFA Champions League best bets Game: FC Barcelona vs. Olympiacos (12:45 p.m. ET)The Pick: Over 3.5 goals (+100)\"Barcelona will be without a plethora of their usual starters. They'll have to play without: Robert Lewandowski, Raphina, Dani Olmo, Ferran Torres and more,\" SportsLine soccer expert Jon Eimer said. \"While this is a troublesome amount of absentees, I think it almost helps the over here. Barcelona still have plenty of big names who love to score goals like Lamine Yamal, Marcus Rashford and Fermin Lopez, but this also should encourage Olympiacos to push for goals. I like BTTS here, but I really like the over 3.5.\"Bet Barcelona vs. Olympiacos at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the promo code CBS20X:Game: Inter Milan vs. Union Saint-Gilloise (12:45 p.m. ET)The Pick: Inter Milan 90-minute money-line (-130)\"Inter Milan should have enough quality to beat Belgian champions Union Saint-Gilloise in Brussels on Tuesday. The Nerazzurri are on a six-game winning streak, and they picked up an impressive 2-0 away victory over Ajax in their last Champions League game,\" Martin Green, another SportsLine soccer handicapper, said. \"Meanwhile, Union Saint-Gilloise lost 4-0 at home to Newcastle in their last Champions League match. They dominate the Belgian league, but that result suggests they could struggle against elite teams like Inter Milan in the Champions League.\"Bet Inter Milan vs. Union Saint-Gilloise at Caesars

No other team even covered in 60% of its games, showcasing how dominant Oklahoma City was both against its opponents and against sportsbooks' expectations. They went 37-15-2 ATS as a home favorite, including the playoffs, to cover in 71.2% of those scenarios as one of the most dominant betting teams in history. The Thunder return their entire starting lineup, and although the Rockets acquired Kevin Durant in the offseason, it could take some time for Houston's chemistry to form. The model projects the Thunder to cover in 71% of simulations. Back the Thunder at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Lakers vs. Warriors: Under 226.5 points (-112)Both the Lakers and Warriors ranked in the bottom third in the NBA in Overs hitting last season, with the Over cashing in 50.5% of Warriors games and 49.4% of Lakers games. The Warriors will likely put Jimmy Butler on Luka Doncic for the majority of the game, which could frustrate the elite scorer with one of the league's top defenders trying to slow him down. Doncic won't have LeBron James (sciatica) to lean on for offensive support either. Opening Night often brings a more postseason-like atmosphere compared to a typical regular-season game, which could bring a sharper defensive focus on both ends, as the model projects the Under to hit in 61.2% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Western Kentucky (+3.5) vs. Louisiana TechFor college football fans, this Conference USA matchup on CBS Sports Network is just one of two options on Tuesday, and the model is predicting an upset.

The Hilltoppers lost to FIU, 25-6, last week, but they had three straight wins before then, led by senior quarterback Maverick McIvor averaging 266.1 passing yards per game. Meanwhile, Louisiana Tech is coming off a 35-7 loss to Kennesaw State.

    "body": "\n        Making Week 8 Fantasy football picks will be harder than any other week, thus far, with six teams on byes. Those players who've been riding the bench all year on your team may finally see the light of day and get inserted into Week 8 Fantasy football lineups. Players like Chase Brown, Chris Olave, Romeo Doubs and Pat Freiermuth have been inconsistent this year but are coming off huge outings. Even Joe Flacco, with his 342-yard, 3-touchdown performance last Thursday, is now part of Fantasy football start/sit decisions for the week ahead.Marvin Mims is another one whose spot in the Week 8 Fantasy football rankings will be of high interest. He's coming off a season high of 98 scrimmage yards and gets to face Dallas' last-ranked passing defense on Sunday. Where does he rank compared to wideouts with similar Fantasy production this year like DJ Moore, Tyquan Thornton and Matthew Golden? Before making your Week 8 Fantasy football picks, be sure to check out the Week 8 Fantasy football rankings from the proven computer model at SportsLine. Bet on every NFL Week 8 game at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your $5 initial wager wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons, especially when there were big differences in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.The same model has a proven track record providing Fantasy football tips, including being ahead of the curve on players like A.J. Brown, Jonathan Taylor, Derrick Henry, Christian McCaffrey, Alvin Kamara and Jahmyr Gibbs. Anybody who banked on players like those could have made a run at their league title.Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 8 of the 2025 NFL season. Head to SportsLine now to see them. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. Top Week 8 Fantasy football picks One surprise in Week 8: The model is fading Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, an MVP candidate who ranks second in both passing yards and touchdowns this season. Prescott sits third amongst quarterbacks in Fantasy points, thanks to 13 touchdowns versus zero picks over the last four weeks. However, none of those defenses match up with the Broncos unit he will face on Sunday, as only Houston has allowed fewer Fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks than Denver.Denver ranks first in sacks, allows the lowest completion percentage and has allowed the second-fewest passing scores on the year. The one spot where it is vulnerable versus quarterbacks is the run game as mobile QBs like Daniel Jones and Jaxson Dart have rushing touchdowns versus Denver. However, a litany of injuries has made Prescott a stationary quarterback who ranks 25th at the position in rushing yards (56). Thus, Prescott may not warrant a spot in Week 8 Fantasy football lineups as he sits outside the top 12 in QB rankings.Another curveball: The model is high on Panthers receiver Tetairoa McMillan. The No. 8 overall pick has had an inconsistent rookie year as he had 100 yards in Week 2 and a two-touchdown outing in Week 6, but he has no other games with either a touchdown or more than 73 yards. McMillan enters Week 8 ranking 27th amongst wideouts in Fantasy points in both standard and PPR leagues.However, he and Carolina will face a Buffalo defense on Sunday which has fallen apart in recent weeks. The Bills gave up just 125.8 passing yards over their first four games but then allowed an average of 250 yards over their last two. Both Stefon Diggs and Drake London had 140-plus receiving yards over the last two weeks versus Buffalo, and six of the seven passing scores the team has allowed have been to wideouts. McMillan slots among the top 12 in positional Fantasy rankings for Week 8, making him a WR1 in 12-team leagues.

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins are not expected to fire coach Mike McDaniel this week despite a 1-6 record and another lethargic showing during Sunday's 31-6 loss against the Cleveland Browns. Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher drilled into McDaniels and what he paints as a lifeless team taking the field without much direction.\"The second half of that game they looked almost disinterested, they looked deflated, almost (like) there was nothing left in the tank,\" Cowher said during 'NFL on CBS' after Sunday's game. \"Almost disengaged. I'm just talking the way I saw it. Tua (Tagovailoa) turned the ball over four times. The defense agave up some big plays. It'll be interesting to see what happens down there.\"There's been a lot of talk about the lack of structure that they have inside the building, but the bottom line, again, we don't know what's going inside that building because we're not there, but we see the product that's on the field. And right now, there's some issues in Miami.\"Tagovailoa detailed Miami's inner turmoil earlier this month when he publicly called out teammates for either being late to or not attending players-only meetings.\nMcDaniel called those remarks from his quarterback a \"misguided interpretation\" of what actually happened, further proof this team and its players simply aren't in-step this season with results reflecting those issues.\nAfter reaching the playoffs his first two seasons, McDaniel is 9-15 since and now 29-29 overall. Tagovailoa, once a Pro Bowl passer under McDaniel, acknowledged his play must improve.\"Definitely not happy, not proud of where I'm at with my play, with how I've gone about things this year,\" Tagovailoa said after averaging just 4.3 yards per attempt and finishing the loss to the Browns with a career-low 24.1 passer rating. \"I know I've gotta be a lot better — and I've been better for the Miami Dolphins in years past. But this isn't years past, this is this year. Just trying to maneuver everything and build a collection of guys to come along with me. I've gotta be able to multitask if that makes sense, and while doing that and get in that flow.\"\nIs it time for McDaniel to send message?Where's the accountability? McDaniel's seeming lack of self-awareness and inability to get his team to play up to their potential are the primary reasons his seat is scorching at midseason. \"If they don't fire Mike McDaniel, I think he should bench Tua and put in Quinn Ewers,\" Danny Kanell said during an appearance on 'NFL on CBS'. \"That to me if how you show your players that Tua is no different than anybody else. If he doesn't perform, he gets benched because that's life as player in the NFL for most people.\"Ahead of this week's game against the Atlanta Falcons, McDaniel stands with Tagovailoa as his starting quarterback, despite benching the former first-rounder in the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss to the Browns.\n\"He's gonna take the snaps this week and he's gonna be our starter this week and my expectation is that we don't throw 10 picks,\" McDaniel said. After catching flack from teammates after failing to take ownership following a Week 6 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, Tagovailoa issued an apology, then proceeded to deliver another three-interception outing on Sunday afternoon. He leads the NFL in giveaways.\"If think if (McDaniel) benched Tua and let Quinn Ewers go out there and play, I think it would send a message to that locker room,\" Kanell said.\nMiami's lone victory this season came against the New York Jets, the NFL's only winless team at this point. After squandering a 17-point lead at Carolina earlier this month and failing to climb out of a 13-point hole in the fourth quarter against the Chargers during a pair of single-possession losses, this latest defeat was particularly deflating.Miami did \"everything to lose the game\" according to McDaniel, who pointed to 11 penalties — the most since 2022 — and four turnovers for reasons his players appeared frustrated in the second half. Cowher wasn't the only one who noticed the Dolphins' poor body language. Miami's coach did, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Florida is in the market for a head football coach once again after firing Billy Napier amid a lackluster 3-4 start to the season. The Gators hope the fifth time is the charm as they've churned through four coaches since Urban Meyer left after the 2010 season, still in search of the one who will lead them back to the top of college football.Prior to Meyer's arrival, Steve Spurrier was the man casting a long shadow over the Florida sideline as the greatest coach in program history, and he shared his thoughts on how the Gators should go about the current coaching search. Spurrier spoke with USA Today and made clear what the Gators' priorities will be this time around. \"I think we're going to try to hire a proven coach who's got a winning record in the SEC or another major conference,\" Spurrier said. \"I think that's the type of coach we're looking for.\"\n        \n            \n                Florida coaching candidates: Lane Kiffin, James Franklin among options on hot board to replace Billy Napier\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat would track with the candidates most often tied to the Gators' opening, headlined by Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin. Spurrier was asked specifically about Kiffin and gave a glowing review, along with offering up another SEC coach that he likes.\n\"I firmly think he is a very good coach,\" Spurrier said of Kiffin. \"There's no question about that. I like him. I like Eli Drinkwitz. I like a lot of guys out there that are proven winners.\"Kiffin is expected to be the starting point for the Gators' coaching search, so this isn't exactly a shocking revelation from Spurrier, but it seems as if Kiffin has the Florida legend's stamp of approval. Kiffin could have a tough decision to make this offseason. He's made Ole Miss a perennial contender in the SEC, but has yet to get all the way to the mountaintop. Does he have a better chance to do that in Oxford or Gainesville? \nWhether it's Kiffin, Drinkwitz, James Franklin or someone else, it's safe to say the Gators will be going for experience in this next spin around the coaching carousel -- at least if Spurrier has his way. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        NBA All-Star and Olympic gold medalist Jimmy Butler joined the NWSL's San Diego Wave as a minority investor, adding his name to a growing list of accomplished athletes who have acquired a stake in women's soccer club.Butler joins Alex Morgan, the retired Wave player and two-time Women's World Cup winner with the U.S. women's national team, as one of the high-profile minority owners in the team. The basketball player is a known soccer fan and has a home just outside of the southern California city, his investment in the Wave serving as a meeting point for those two things.\n\"Soccer has been a passion of mine for a long time, and being part of the game in a meaningful way has always been a dream,\" Butler said in a statement issued by the club on Monday. \"San Diego has become a city close to my heart, and I'm proud to invest in a Club that is pushing boundaries, building something lasting, and setting a new standard for what women's sports can be both on and off the pitch.\" Butler adds his investment in the Wave to a growing business portfolio, led by Bigface, the coffee lifestyle brand he co-founded in 2020 initially as a way of selling coffee to other NBA players in the NBA Bubble during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Warriors star also has several other investments in businesses across the sports, lifestyle and wellness industries.\n\"Jimmy is a competitor and visionary who shares our values and our ambition to grow this Club,\" Lauren Leichtman, controlling co-owner of the Wave, said. \"He brings a global perspective, a deep respect for the athlete's journey, and a creative spirit that perfectly complements what we are building here at Wave FC.\" The Levine Leichtman family office completed its takeover of the Wave in October 2024 for a deal reportedly worth a total valuation of $120 million, with Morgan joining the ownership group months later.\nThe Wave have booked a spot in the 2025 NWSL playoffs and sit in fifth place with one more match in the regular season to go. They will next play the NWSL Shield-winning Kansas City Current on Nov. 2, and a win could take them as high as third place in the table and guarantee them hosting rights for the quarterfinals.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time since Jon Jones' March 2023 win over Cyril Gane, the UFC's undisputed heavyweight championship will be defended without an active interim title in play. Tom Aspinall, the former interim titleholder who has now been upgraded to full champion, will make his first defense when he welcomes Gane on Saturday in the main event of UFC 321 in Abu Dhabi. The reason for the division's issues in recent years has been Jones' combination of inactivity and an unwillingness to defend his title against Aspinall. But, in June, Jones vacated the title and briefly retired before announcing just days later that he plans on returning later this year. \n        \n            \n                UFC Fight Night results, highlights: Brendan Allen scores upset win after Reinier de Ridder quits on his stool\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAs we prepare for the promotion's 22nd trip to the capital city of the United Arab Emirates, let's take a closer look at the biggest storylines entering the card. 1. Seemingly all of the pressure is on Tom Aspinall As successful as Aspinall has been throughout nine walks to the Octagon, including eight stoppage wins and one loss due to a knee injury (that was avenged by KO three fights later), there are still key aspects about the 32-year-old Englishman's game that we don't know. He has never been past the second round in 18 pro fights, let alone ever reaching the championship distance of five rounds. How is he on the ground? What does his chin look like in a firefight? All we know, up to this point, is that Aspinall has fast hands and huge power, along with the fact that he tends to keep his chin exposed while backpedaling (yet has never been made to pay for it). And then there were the constant comments from Jones while trying to justify his ducking of Aspinall, which included questioning his ability to fight, sell tickets and whether he's not a flash-in-the-pan in waiting. Should Aspinall, who is more than a 4-to-1 betting favorite against Gane, lose in any form, would that somehow validate the dismissive comments of Jones? Either way, Aspinall must prove against Gane that Jones had good reason not to risk his near-perfect fighting record on such a dynamic and explosive talent who very much appears to be the future of the division. \n2. With that said, it feels like now or never for Cyril Gane's championship hopesThe 35-year-old Gane once looked like the prototype heavyweight of the future when the 6-foot-5 kickboxer arrived on the UFC scene in 2019, just one year after leaving Muay Thai behind to try MMA for the first time. Gane even went as far as stopping Derrick Lewis to claim the interim heavyweight title in 2021 while improving to 10-0 as a pro. But the ensuing four years saw Gane seemingly regress instead of improving. His ground game was badly exposed in a pair of disappointing title losses to Francis Ngannou (who fought with one working knee) and Jones (who submitted Gane just 2:04 into Round 1). In between, there were also a few rough moments during victories as Gane was visibly hurt multiple times in a 2022 knockout win over Tai Tuivasa. And then there was his most recent fight last December, in a rematch with Alexander Volkov, where Gane captured a highly disputed win via split decision, which UFC CEO Dana White openly disagreed. Gane, who briefly looked reborn in a 2023 TKO win over a streaking Serghei Spivac, knows full well that this could be his final shot at the undisputed crown after two disappointing endings in the past. It will be up to the native of France to take Aspinall into deep waters and prove he has improved upon his glaring weaknesses on the ground. 3. Zhang Weili's departure has left the women's strawweight division up for grabsZhang, the 36-year-old Chinese star and two-time champion at 115 pounds, recently vacated her title in order to move up to challenge flyweight queen Valentina Shevchenko in a historic superfight that will serve as the co-headliner for UFC 322 in November. The good news, however, is that Zhang's exit, at a time when strawweight lacks the star-powered depth it once knew, opens up a massive opportunity for whomever is able to seize it. Enter Virna Jandiroba and Mackenzie Dern, who will meet in a rematch of their 2020 bout, in this weekend's co-main event for the vacant title. Jandiroba, who lost three of her first six UFC fights after debuting in 2019, has found her stride late in the Octagon as the former Invicta FC champion is riding a five-fight win streak at age 37. The native of Brazil is soft-spoken but highly technical inside the cage and her resurgence has produced wins over a handful of top contenders like Yan Xiaonan, Amanda Lemos, Loopy Godinez and Marina Rodriguez. Dern, who claimed a decision win over Jandiroba in their first meeting, has had a different road to the top and was thought to be a future star with huge marketing potential ever since her 2018 debut. Although Dern is currently riding a two-fight win streak, she's just 3-4 in her last seven fights. At 32, Dern's time is right now but she will need to shake off a history of poor gameplanning and inconsistent striking technique to fulfill her potential against a former foe who has consistently improved. 4. Is Umar Nurmagomedov the only bantamweight who can beat Merab Dvalishvili?That might seem like a silly question to pose, especially considering a then-unbeaten Nurmagomedov lost a unanimous decision while challenging Dvalishvili for the title in January. But the dominant Dvalishvili, who returns for his fourth title defense of 2025 in a December rematch against former champion Petr Yan, has very few weaknesses and Nurmagomedov still has the perfectly well-rounded game to potentially give him trouble. Nurmagomedov, the cousin of UFC Hall of Famer Khabib Nurmagomedov, also broke his right hand in Round 1 against Dvalishvili last time and believes he still did enough to win despite 48-47 (twice) and 49-46 scorecards. Not only does Nurmagomedov have the ability to threaten takedowns against Dvalishvili, the only thing he lacked against \"The Machine\" appeared to be a gas tank on par with the Georgian champion who never tires. Nurmagomedov has said he will adjust that gap entering his return against Mario Bautista. With Dvalishvili having effectively cleaned out the division, Saturday's winner should get the next shot at the champion and Nurmagomedov has been installed as high as a 6-to-1 betting favorite to snap Bautista's eight-fight win streak.   \n5. Alexander Volkov's \"gift\" is anything but an easy fightVolkov, the towering Russian giant, had his resurgent five-fight win streak snapped in December when Gane took home a split-decision that almost no one agreed with. The result seemed, at first, like yet another time in which Volkov lost a big fight that could've catapulted him into a title shot (similar to how he was knocked out by Derrick Lewis in the closing seconds of a 2018 fight he was thoroughly winning). Luckily for Volkov, White agreed he had been done wrong against Gane by the judges and was heard on camera consoling Volkov by saying he will \"take care of him\" in the future. Apparently, that meant a key contender's bout against Brazilian ground specialist Jailton Almeida, who is 8-1 in the UFC with seven wins by finish (and four via submission). Almeida enters as a slight betting favorite given the inconsistent takedown defense that the 36-year-old Volkov has often shown. But the good news is that a victory, provided he doesn't get passed over by a returning Jones or a rising Alex Pereira, likely puts him in line for a UFC title shot that remains elusive to the former Bellator MMA champion. \n            ",

The Vikings rank second in third-down defense and fourth in redzone defense as nearly 70% of their defensive possessions don't end up in them allowing points, which is the second-best mark in the league. A relentless pass rush is a big reason for that as Minnesota is third in hurry percentage and fourth in sack percentage.On offense, Jordan Mason has averaged 70.5 rushing yards over his four starts -- all coming in the last four games -- and he has four touchdowns over this stretch. Out wide, Justin Jefferson continues to produce regardless of who is throwing him passes as he's fourth in the league with 88 receiving yards per game this year. No. 2 wideout, Jordan Addison, has also hit the ground running since coming off his suspension with at least 114 receiving yards or a touchdown in all three of his games in 2025. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverLos Angeles has the league's leading passer in Justin Herbert (1,913 yards), who is also on pace for a career-high of 452 rushing yards. Herbert leads the No. 3 passing attack in the NFL, and he has a bevy of options at his disposal. Keenan Allen, Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston all have at least 380 receiving yards, while L.A. found a steal in the fifth round of the draft in rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden II. The son of a former NFL receiver, Gadsden II had a 7-164-1 stat line on Sunday, with the yardage being the fourth-most by a rookie tight end since 1960.The Chargers defense is getting healthier as nine-time Pro Bowler Khalil Mack returned last week after missing a month and notched his second sack of the season. Even with Mack missing most of the year, only one team has allowed fewer passing touchdowns than Los Angeles, and it's a defense which may not be on the field that often on Thursday. That's because Minnesota's defense has logged lots of snaps as of late as the Vikings haven't forced a turnover in three straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets after placing a $5 wager:How to make Chargers vs. Vikings picksFor the NFL Week 8 'Thursday Night Football' game of Vikings vs. Chargers, the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 45 total points.

    "body": "\n        While Michael Jordan had the most famous and successful comeback in sports history, the NFL has also had its share of notable unretirements over the years. Longtime Eagles pass rusher Brandon Graham is adding his name to said list as he has officially ended his seven-month retirement to rejoin the defending champs. Specifically, Graham joins a pretty elite group of pass rushers who came out of retirement. Among those players is Hall of Famers Reggie White, Charles Haley, and former Defensive Player of the Year James Harrison. Like Graham, Harrison came out of retirement less than a year after he initially hanged up his cleats. He played 3.5 more seasons before choosing to retire for good after he and the Patriots lost to Graham's Eagles in Super Bowl LII. While Harrison's comeback was a success, not every NFL comeback has had a similar story. It's safe to assume that Graham is hoping that his comeback rivals the following list of the most successful unretirements in NFL history, a list that includes arguably the greatest player of all time. 15. Randy Moss, WR (2012)After a year away from football, the dynamic Moss returned for the 2012 season as a member of the 49ers. Moss caught 28 of 50 targets for 434 yards and three touchdowns that season while averaging a solid 15.5 yards per catch. \nIn the playoffs, Moss caught seven passes for 112 yards that included two grabs for 41 yards in San Francisco's Super Bowl loss to Baltimore, which proved to be the final game of his Hall of Fame career. 14. Reggie White, DE (2000)A Pro Bowler each year from 1986-98, White signed with the Panthers for what ended up being the final year of his Hall of Fame career. In 16 games, White recorded 5.5 sacks before retiring as the NFL's career leader with 198 sacks. 13. Deion Sanders, DB (2004)Sanders chose his age -- 37 -- as his new uniform number upon signing with the Ravens and thus ending his three-year retirement. Despite making just six starts, Sanders was still a productive player during his two years in Baltimore. He recorded five interceptions that included his ninth career pick six. \n12. Eric Weddle, DB (2021) After having a borderline Hall of Fame career with the Chargers and Ravens, Weddle retired after the 2019 season before briefly ending his retirement in January 2022. Weddle signed with the Rams -- who had suffered injuries as safety -- just before the start of the playoffs. Weddle, 36 years old at the time, played well despite spending the previous two years on the couch. He started and won his only Super Bowl after helping the Rams defeat the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI. 11. Russ Francis, TE (1982)A three-time Pro Bowler with the Patriots, Francis played seven more seasons after signing with the defending champion 49ers ahead of the 1982 season. He won a Super Bowl with the 1984 49ers and later finished his 13-year career in New England.  \n\n        \n            \n                Brandon Graham returns to Eagles: How his comeback impacts pass rush, plus potential trade deadline targets\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n10. Tom Brady, QB (2022)Brady returned for what would be his final NFL season 40 days after announcing his retirement on social media. While the 2022 season wasn't his best, the 45-year-old Brady still played extremely well. For a second straight year, he led the NFL in both attempts and completions while throwing for 4,694 yards (the fifth-highest total of his career) and leading the 8-9 Buccaneers to a second straight division title. Brady's decorated career came to an end in the wild card round. He went 35 of 66 passing for 351 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in a 31-14 loss to the Cowboys. \n9. Marshawn Lynch, RB (2017) Lynch famously announced his first retirement via a vague social media post during the Super Bowl. An Oakland native, Lynch returned a year later in order to fulfill his dream of playing for his childhood team, the Raiders. In 15 games, Lynch ran for a respectable 891 yards and seven touchdowns while averaging 4.3 yards per carry. Lynch played in just six games in 2018 and didn't play at all in 2019 until he signed with the Seahawks -- the team he spent the majority of his 12-year career with -- late in the regular season. Lynch capped off his career by scoring three touchdowns in the postseason and helping Seattle win its final playoff game of the Pete Carroll era. 8. James Harrison, LB (2014)From a longevity standpoint, Harrison's comeback is one of the best in NFL history. While he was no longer an Pro Bowl level player, the 2008 Defensive Player of the Year was still an able pass rusher who helped the Steelers win three division titles over a four-year span. \nIn 2015, Harrison had two sacks during the postseason and led all postseason defenders in tackles for loss. A year later, Harrison became the Steelers' career sack leader. In the playoffs, he had 2.5 sacks and once again led all defenders in tackles for loss as Pittsburgh got to within one game of the Super Bowl. Unhappy with his lack of playing time, a then 39-year-old Harrison left the Steelers late in the 2017 season. He finished his career in New England after helping the Patriots reach the Super Bowl. 7. Randall Cunningham, QB (1997) An electric player during his prime, Cunningham retired after the 1995 season after winning just one of his four starts. He returned in 1997 with the Vikings as a backup, but ended the year with five consecutive starts that included a thrilling come-from-behind win over the Giants in the wild card round. \nIn 1998, Cunningham had the best season of his career. Armed with future Hall of Fame wideouts Randy Moss and Cris Carter, Cunningham finished second in the MVP voting while leading an offense that scored a then-NFL-record 556 points. \nAfter a 15-1 season, the Vikings' season came to a crashing halt after they were upset by the Falcons one game shy of the Super Bowl. Cunningham, lost his starting job the following season and finished his career as a backup in Baltimore. 6. Rob Gronkowski, TE (2020) Gronkowski added to his legacy as arguably the greatest tight end in NFL history when he reunited with Tom Brady in Tampa. After a one-year retirement, Gronkowski caught seven touchdowns in the regular season before catching one of Brady's three touchdown passes in the Buccaneers' Super Bowl win over the defending champion Chiefs. He had another productive season in 2021 before hanging up his cleats for good. \n5. Ricky Williams, RB (2005) Williams' career would be remembered much differently had he not returned to the game in 2005 following one of the most shocking retirements in NFL history. After missing the entire 2004 season, the 1998 Heisman Trophy winner enjoyed a productive 2005 season while sharing the workload in the Dolphins' backfield with then-rookie Ronnie Brown. Williams would miss most of the next two seasons before having three more largely productive seasons with the Dolphins before finishing his career with the Ravens. While his retirement and 2006 suspension likely cost him a chance at the Hall of Fame, Williams still carved out an impressive career that included a rushing title and 10,009 career rushing yards. He does regret not finishing his career in Miami, which would have given him a chance to surpass Hall of Famer Larry Csonka as the franchise's career rushing leader. \n4. Brett Favre, QB (2009)  Favre's second comeback in as many seasons proved to be a memorable one. After spending one so-so season with the Jets, the 40-year-old Favre decided to come back again the following season while signing with the Vikings. A big motivation behind Favre signing with the Vikings was that it would give him the chance to face his longtime team -- the Packers -- twice during the 2009 season. Favre was lights out in both games against his former team, throwing a combined seven touchdowns and no picks while completing nearly 70% of his passes. The Vikings won both games en route to winning the NFC North. \nFavre's MVP-caliber season ended in heartbreak however, as his late-game interception contributed to Minnesota's overtime loss to the Saints in the NFC title game. Favre and the Vikings then endured a forgettable 2010 season that included two losses to the Packers, who won that Super Bowl that year. \nFavre retired after that season and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2016. 3. Ed 'Too Tall' Jones, DE (1980) The Cowboys' menacing pass rusher briefly retired after the 1978 season to pursue a boxing career. Jones returned a year later, however, and played another 10 years that included three consecutive Pro Bowl nods and an All-Pro selection in 1982. A member of Dallas' 1977 Super Bowl-winning team, Jones' 106 sacks is the fourth-highest career total in Cowboys history. 2. Bronco Nagurski, FB/LB/T, 1943 One of the greatest players during the NFL's first 50 seasons, Nagurski had been retired for over five years before he came back for the 1943 season due to the Bears losing so many of their players to World War II. Nagurski played tackle that season and also scored a touchdown as a fullback to help propel the Bears to the NFL Championship Game. He scored again in the title game as the Bears recorded a 41-21 win over Washington. A member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's inaugural induction class, Nagurski retired for good after the '43 season. 1. John Riggins, RB (1981) Riggins retired after the 1979 season over a contract dispute. He returned, however, prior to the 1981 season while proclaiming, \"I'm broke, I'm bored, and I'm back.\" Riggins' return started with a memorable meeting with then-Washington first-year coach coach Joe Gibbs, who drove to Kansas to try convince Riggins to come out of retirement. Gibbs, however, was taken aback when Riggins, who had a beer in hand when Gibbs arrived at his home, offered him a drink as well. Mortified, Gibbs left the meeting with the thought of possibly trading Riggins for a high draft pick if he rejoined the team. Riggins quickly squashed that idea, though. \"Two days later, I get a phone call from John,\" Gibbs recalled. \"He goes, 'Joe, there's only one thing I want in my contract. ... A no-trade clause.' \"Now, I tell everybody, somebody up there was looking out over me.\" Gibbs' was ultimately rewarded for re-signing Riggins, who led Washington to the franchise's first Super Bowl win a year later. He won Super Bowl MVP honors while carrying the ball a Super Bowl-record 38 times in Washington's 27-17 win over the Dolphins. \nRiggins then led the NFL in rushing touchdowns the next two years while leading Washington back to the Super Bowl in 1983. He retired for good after the 1985 season and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1992.\n            ",

The Indianapolis Colts have the best record in the AFC through seven weeks, while the New England Patriots hold on to the AFC East lead for another week. The Denver Broncos comeback victory over the New York Giants vaulted them to the top of the AFC West. In the NFC, the Green Bay Packers held serve on their NFC North lead due to their comeback victory over the Arizona Cardinals. The Philadelphia Eagles took a bigger lead in the NFC East as they look to become the first repeat winner of the division in 21 years. The Detroit Lions knocked the Tampa Bay Buccaneers out of the top spot in the conference on Monday night as well. Below is a breakdown of the seven teams that are currently in the playoffs after  Week 7. In addition to the seven playoff teams, let's look at their schedules and predict if they'll get in the playoffs or not -- along with the contenders for a playoff spot. AFC playoff pictureSeedTeamWLTPCT1Colts610 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.8572Patriots520 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7143Broncos520 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7144Steelers420 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.6675Bills420.6676Chargers430.5717Jaguars430.5711. Indianapolis Colts (6-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Titans, at Steelers, vs. Falcons, Bye, at Chiefs, vs. Texans, at Jaguars, at Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, at TexansThe Colts certainly have benefitted from an easy schedule to open the season, but they have wins over the Broncos, Rams, and Chargers -- all teams with winning records. This is a good football team that's two games up in the AFC South. Indianapolis should have one of the seven playoff spots. 2. New England Patriots (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Browns, vs. Falcons, at Buccaneers, vs. Jets, at Bengals, vs. Giants, Bye, vs. Bills, at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots have the lead over the Bills in the AFC East via the head-to-head tiebreaker and have taken advantage of a light schedule. They have a favorable schedule all year and should challenge the Bills for the division. At worst, the Patriots are a wild card based on how they're playing. 3. Denver Broncos (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Cowboys, at Texans, vs. Raiders, at Texans, Bye, at Commanders, at Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersThe comeback kings of the AFC, Denver rallied from a 19-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat New York on Sunday -- their second 18+ fourth-quarter deficit the Broncos erased this month. The schedule gets a little easier over the next month, but the Broncos still have to play the Chiefs twice. Denver leads the AFC West now, but the Broncos are hanging by a thread with Kansas City coming. 4. Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Packers, vs. Colts, at Chargers, vs. Bengals, at Bears, vs. Bills, at Ravens, vs. Dolphins, at Lions, at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers have firm control of the AFC North, even with the loss to the Bengals this week. The Browns got into the mix with a win over the Dolphins but this is Pittsburgh's division to lose. The schedule does get significantly tougher, and the Steelers play the Ravens twice. The AFC North could fall back to the field if Pittsburgh can't beat Green Bay and Indianapolis coming up. 5. Buffalo Bills (4-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, at Panthers, vs. Chiefs, at Dolphins, vs. Buccaneers, at Texans, at Steelers, vs. Bengals, at patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsThe Bills have lost two in a row, but they are still a Super Bowl contender in the conference. They'll be in an AFC East fight with the Patriots, but it would be shocking if Buffalo didn't make the playoffs. A win over the Chiefs will catapult their season. 6. Los Angeles Chargers (4-3)Remaining schedule: vs. Vikings, at Titans, vs. Steelers, at Jaguars, Bye, vs. Raiders, vs. Eagles, at Chiefs, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers have lost three of four since their 3-0 start, falling to second in the AFC West. If there's a team that doesn't appear to be in the playoffs come January, it's looking like the Chargers. Wins over the Chiefs and Broncos do help them in the division race. 7. Jacksonville Jaguars (4-3)Remaining schedule: Bye, at Raiders, at Texans, vs. Chargers, at Cardinals, at Titans, vs. Colts, vs. Jets, at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars have lost two in a row since beating the Chiefs to weeks ago, falling from one of the surprise teams in the league to an also-ran. The good news? The Raiders and Texans are coming up, but Jacksonville will be fighting for a playoff spot all year. Their spot is certainly up for grabs. Who's in and who's out?The Chargers and Jaguars are in a free fall, while the Chiefs (4-3) appear primed to take one of those spots. Kansas City has won two in a row since the Jacksonville loss and have Rashee Rice back from suspension, along with a healthy Xavier Worthy to team up with Hollywood Brown and Travis Kelce.Let's bank on the Chiefs taking the AFC West, making the Broncos and Chargers fighting for a wild card spot. The Patriots and Bills will battle it out for the AFC East, with both of those teams making the playoffs. The Bengals (3-4) have climbed back into the AFC North race, but they have some work to do (and sit one game out of the No. 7 seed). The Ravens (1-5) are getting Lamar Jackson back healthy as well, so it's hard to count them out until they lose another game. The Colts have control of the AFC South, but the Jaguars are still in the mix for a playoff spot. The Texans (2-4) have a massive hill to climb. Here are the early predictions for the AFC playoff teams though Week 7:Colts (AFC North)Chiefs (AFC West)Bills (AFC East)Steelers (AFC North)Patriots (wild card)Broncos (wild card)Chargers (wild card)  NFC playoff picture    RankTeamWLTPCT1Packers411.750249ers520.7143Eagles520.7144Buccaneers520 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t.7145Lions520.7146Seahawks520.7147Rams520.7141. Green Bay Packers (4-1-1)Remaining schedule: at Steelers, vs. Panthers, vs. Eagles, at Giants, vs. Vikings, at Lions, vs. Bears, at Broncos, at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsThe Packers have the best record in the NFC and a win over the Lions, but they haven't played up to their potential yet (which is scary for the rest of the league). They have three straight games against teams over .500, a test to see how good Green Bay actually is. Regardless, the Packers are a playoff team in the NFC.2. San Francisco 49ers (5-2)Remaining schedule: at Texans, at Giants, vs. Rams, at Cardinals, vs. Panthers, at Browns, Bye, vs. Titans, at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe 49ers have sustained injury after injury, but still lead the NFC West. The schedule is very favorable, and the 49ers are 3-0 in the division already. This is a playoff team, and in the hunt for home-field advantage in the NFC. 3. Philadelphia Eagles (5-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Giants, Bye, at Packers, vs. Lions, at Cowboys, vs. Bears, at Chargers, vs. Raiders, at Commanders, at Bills, vs. CommandersThe Eagles do have control of the NFC East with a win over the second-place Cowboys already in the early going. The schedule is tough coming out of the bye week, but this is one of the most talented teams in the NFL. They'll have a playoff spot. 4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-2)Remaining schedule: at Saints, Bye, vs. Patriots, at Bills, at Rams, vs. Cardinals, vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersThe Buccaneers are in control in the NFC South, even though the Panthers are improving. Carolina could be a sneaky playoff contender, but Tampa Bay could have a commanding lead in the division by Week 16. The NFC South is Tampa Bay's to lose, even with Monday's loss to Detroit. 5. Detroit Lions (5-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, vs. Vikings, at Commanders, at Eagles, vs. Giants, vs. Packers, vs. Cowboys, at Rams, vs. Steelers, at Vikings, at BearsMonday's win over the Buccaneers catapulted the Lions' playoff chances, and put Detroit in the mix for the NFC North. Detroit has losses to Green Bay and Kansas City and has a brutal schedule remaining, but the Lions are one of the more talented teams in the NFL. 6. Seattle Seahawks (5-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, at Commanders, vs. Cardinals, at Rams, at Titans, vs. Vikings, at Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersThe Seahawks have the look of a playoff team, and Monday's win over the Texans was massive toward their playoff chances. Two games against the Rams and a rematch with the 49ers will be fun, as the NFC West is a brutal division. Three teams from the NFC West may make the playoffs. 7. Los Angeles Rams (5-2)Remaining schedule: Bye, vs. Saints, at 49ers, vs. Seahawks, vs. Buccaneers, at Panthers, at Cardinals, vs. Lions, at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsA tough schedule in November could decide the NFC West, but the Rams are right in the mix for the division. They should have a wild card spot (at least) if Matthew Stafford stays healthy, as Los Angeles is a Super Bowl contender in the NFC. \nWho's in and who's out?The Buccaneers have a one-game lead in the NFC South, and still should take care of business in the division even with Carolina emerging. The Panthers (4-3) are in contention for a playoff spot, which is a surprise this year. Carolina has Buffalo and Green Bay next, which will determine its contender fate -- especially with Bryce Young set to miss at least a game. The Eagles have control of the NFC East, but the Cowboys (3-3-1) are trying to enter the playoff picture. The Commanders (3-4) continue to lose ground on a wild card spot in a loaded NFC. In the NFC North, the Packers (4-1-1) and Lions (5-2) are battling for the NFC North -- but the Bears (4-2) are in the mix as well. Chicago is also in the running for a playoff spot, currently possessing the No. 8 seed (half game out of the playoffs).The NFC West is loaded, as three teams (49ers, Seahawks, Rams) are 5-2 through seven weeks. The NFC North and NFC West could cancel each other out in the playoff race, but the NFC West is in better shape to have three teams in the playoffs. \nThe seven teams in right now? They may be the seven teams in come January. Here are the early predictions for the NFC playoff teams though Week 7:49ers (NFC West)Eagles (NFC East)Lions (NFC North)Buccaneers (NFC South)Packers (wild card)Rams (wild card)Seahawks (wild card)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        If looking for ranked contests to make Week 9 college football picks on, you'll have to look at the SEC, as the conference has all three such matchups. No. 3 Texas A&M vs. No. 20 LSU (+2.5), No. 8 Ole Miss vs. No. 13 Oklahoma (-4.5) and No. 10 Vanderbilt vs. No. 15 Missouri (+2.5) will help shape the conference's hierarchy, but there are intriguing matchups outside of the SEC. The latest Week 9 college football odds have No. 2 Indiana at -24.5 versus UCLA in the Big Ten, No. 9 Miami at -30.5 versus Stanford in the ACC and No. 11 BYU at -2.5 versus Iowa State in the Big 12.The Group of Five shouldn't be overlooked with any college football predictions either with South Florida of the American the highest-ranked team outside the Power Four. The 18th-ranked Bulls are favored by 5.5 points over a Memphis squad coming off its first defeat, according to the latest Week 9 college football spreads.

UW will host this contest, which is important to note as the Huskies have been one of the best home teams versus the spread under Jedd Fisch. Since he took over last year, Washington is 7-3 ATS at home and 6-2 versus the line as a home favorite. Illinois was embarrassed with a 53-point loss at Indiana earlier this year, and the Illini are coming off an 18-point loss -- and failing to cover -- at home versus Ohio State on Saturday. Add in that Washington has defeated Illinois in four straight meetings, and the model has the Huskies (-4.5) covering almost 60% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Colorado (+13.5, 49.5) covers against Utah in nearly 60% of simulations Saturday at 10:15 p.m. ET. The Buffs upset then-No. 22 Iowa State in Week 7 before their bye, and Colorado is 3-1 ATS following a bye under Deion Sanders. On the other hand, Utah is just 1-5 ATS with a rest disadvantage over the last four seasons, and the Utes lost their AP ranking with a defeat to BYU on Saturday. Utah's once vaunted defense has been exploited in recent weeks as it's allowed an average of 204 rushing yards, and forced zero turnovers, over the last three weeks. With the running ability of Colorado QB Kaidon Salter, who's averaging over 50 yards on the ground with three scores over his last four games, the Buffs have enough offense to stay within the line. The model also predicts the Under hits well over 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 9The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 9, and it's calling for multiple upsets, including four underdogs winning straight up. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which four underdogs outright win?

The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays will face off in the Fall Classic beginning Friday night, a battle between the perennial contenders and a team that hasn't been to the World Series since 1993.The Dodgers blew threw the postseason after winning the NL West, sweeping the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Series, taking down the Philadelphia Phillies in four games in the NLDS and then sweeping the MLB-best Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS. The Blue Jays, on the other hand, earned a bye through the Wild Card Series, beat the New York Yankees in the ALDS and then pulled off a comeback against the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS.If we're lucky, this one will go the distance and we won't crown a champion until after Game 7 on Nov. 1.

(I also picked the Yankees to meet them here, so hey, who cares.) I think this Dodgers team, when close to healthy, is the best in baseball. Anything can happen in a seven-game series -- and I do hope we end the year with seven great contests -- but I'm going to stick with my original pick. Pick: Dodgers in 7Axisa: The Dodgers manhandled the Brewers in the NLCS, though I wouldn't say their offense fired on all cylinders that series, and it's hard to expect their pitching to be that good again. Toronto's offense is similar to Milwaukee's, just better, because it has power to go along with all the contact. I think these two teams are fairly evenly matched even though it feels like there's an air of invincibility with the Dodgers right now. I guess I just have an easier time seeing their lineup going cold with runners in scoring position for 7-10 days than I do Toronto's. Pick: Blue Jays in 7McWilliams: This series might go longer than people expect because the Blue Jays are the best hitting team in baseball -- deep, versatile, and capable of getting into the Dodgers' bullpen. Still, the Dodgers are too good. Their elite starters and star position players cover up any bullpen concerns and know how to win this time of year. I picked Dodgers in six, but it wouldn't surprise me if it ends in five. Pick: Dodgers in 6Perry: The Dodgers seem to be peaking at just the right time, as they've won nine of the 10 games they've played this postseason. That's no accident: they're an excellent team whose roster is tailored for playoff success. They're also as healthy as they've been in some time, and unlike last year -- when they of course won the World Series -- the rotation is full and in top form. The Jays, meantime, are thinner in the rotation and will be less rested going into the World Series. That's to say nothing of the Bo Bichette questions. The Dodgers just seem like the stronger team right now with more rest and fewer question marks. Pick: Dodgers in 6 \nSnyder: That starting pitching is rested up and dominant at least two times through the order each game, maybe even a third in some cases. The Dodgers' offense hasn't even fully awakened, but there will be spots it happens against this Blue Jays pitching staff -- enough that it's a short series. Pick: Dodgers in 5\n            ",

With each win, their hopes of a conference championship — and potentially a College Football Playoff berth — grow more realistic.Here's how oddsmakers view the six remaining unbeaten teams as threats to win their respective conference titles and where they stand in the national championship picture.TeamConferenceNational Championship oddsConference Championship oddsOhio StateBig Ten13/5-155IndianaBig Ten8-1+190Texas A&MSEC10-1+340Georgia TechACC100-1+230BYUBig 12225-16-1NavyAmerican1000-113/2Odds via FanDuel SportsbookUnsurprisingly, only three of the six -- Ohio State, Indiana and Texas A&M -- are being taken seriously by oddsmakers as national title contenders.\nThe Buckeyes are the favorites to win it all, while Indiana ranks third behind Alabama (13/2). Both are heavy favorites to reach the Big Ten Championship Game, with clear paths toward a potential rematch in Indianapolis. Ohio State's season finale at No. 25 Michigan is the only ranked opponent left on either team's schedule, and both will be double-digit favorites the rest of the way.Texas A&M sits fifth in the national title odds, just behind Oregon (19/2), and trails only Alabama (+125) in the SEC championship race. The Aggies face three more ranked opponents, including road trips to No. 20 LSU and No. 15 Missouri over the next two weeks. If they emerge 9-0, their SEC and national title odds should improve significantly.Georgia Tech, despite a No. 7 ranking, sits well back at 100-1 to win the national title. Still, the Yellow Jackets have the second-shortest odds among ACC teams, behind only Miami (17-1), and are now the betting favorites to win the conference championship. A favorable remaining schedule -- featuring Syracuse, NC State, Boston College and Pitt -- gives them a legitimate chance to reach Charlotte unbeaten.BYU hasn't earned the same respect in the Big 12. The Cougars are listed at 225-1 to win the national title, third among Big 12 teams behind Texas Tech (27-1) and Arizona State (200-1). They also trail those two in Big 12 title odds, with the Red Raiders still the slight favorite (-105) despite last week's loss to Arizona State. BYU's remaining road games at No. 14 Texas Tech and No. 21 Cincinnati loom large, and oddsmakers expect the Cougars to stumble at least once or twice down the stretch.\nThen there's Navy, the lone unbeaten Group of Five team at 6-0. The Midshipmen are long shots at 1,000-1 to win the national title and rank fourth in American Conference title odds behind USF (+130), Tulane (+350) and North Texas (+450). The second half of the season will be challenging, with games against FAU, North Texas, No. 12 Notre Dame, USF, Memphis and Army. Navy is projected to lose at least three of those contests, but a late-season run could make things interesting in the American title race.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA is officially back. The season tips off Tuesday evening with the Houston Rockets at the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder, followed by an interstate rivalry when the Golden State Warriors take on the Lakers in Los Angeles.  And with that, we're off. The NBA never lacks for drama, and this season figures to be no different. Here are seven pressing questions we're focused on as the 2025-26 campaign gets going.  1. How will the Kawhi investigation shake out? The NBA is investigating the Clippers for a possible salary cap circumvention violation after podcaster and journalist Pablo Torre dropped an unexpected anvil on the league's head this summer. According to Torre's reporting, Leonard signed a four-year $28 million endorsement deal with a company called Aspiration in April 2022, nine months after re-signing with the Clippers. Leonard also received a reported $20 million in Aspiration stock options. Several months earlier, in September of 2021, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer invested $50 million in Aspiration. Despite the deal, there's no evidence that Leonard ever did any endorsement work for Aspiration, and an unnamed employee who purportedly worked for the company told Torre the arrangement was to \"circumvent the salary cap.\"   The Clippers have denied any wrongdoing, and Ballmer has said he was \"conned\" by \"guys who committed fraud.\" In August, Aspiration co-founder Joe Sandberg pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud.  \nUnsurprisingly, Leonard was asked about all this at media day and tried to shrug it off by saying he doesn't deal with \"conspiracies or clickbait analysts.\" But in that same session when he was asked whether he was still owed some $7 million by Aspiration, Leonard had a surprising reply. \"I'm not sure, I gotta take a look back at the books,\" Leonard said. \"No, it's more than that for sure.\" Love to wave away would-be clickbait with one hand while counting the money you're pretty sure you're still owed by the company you reportedly didn't do any work for with the other.  \nThis thing is a mess, and it will likely linger over the Clippers and the NBA as the season and the investigation continue. The league absolutely has to get this right, which brings us to…  2. How will Adam Silver handle several pressing issues? Heavy lies the crown. In addition to the aforementioned investigation, Silver is juggling several other important matters. Domestic expansion has been a hot topic for years now, with cities like Seattle, Las Vegas and Kansas City, among others, mentioned as potential new outposts should the NBA add two more teams. But growing the league in the states isn't all the league has in mind. The NBA has recently made plain its desire to expand to Europe and set up a new operation to rival the EuroLeague. That could be big business, with massive amounts of money flowing to the NBA in expansion fees if they can get the new league abroad operational.  \nSilver said that the domestic and European expansion plans are on separate but parallel tracks. That would be a lot all by itself. Then throw in the various issues that pop up over the course of the season, not to mention the ever-changing All-Star Weekend format that has become a regular focal point for the commissioner in a never-ending attempt to fix a showcase that has been broken for some time now. And, yeah, eventually he's gonna have to make a ruling on what the richest owner in the league did or did not do regarding Kawhi and the salary cap.  This will be Silver's 12th full season as commissioner. It might also be his toughest.  Big news, NBA fans. The all-new DraftKings promo code gives new users three free months of NBA League Pass and $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.

After reports that the Knicks had engaged the Bucks in trade talks regarding Giannis Antetokounmpo, it's not surprising that Rivers was asked about the drama and whether his star player had designs on relocating. It is equally unsurprising that Doc wasn't thrilled about fielding those questions.  \"What's the old saying -- you create the story and then you report on the story you created,\" Rivers told the media recently. \"That's what it feels like, and it gets old for us. But at the end of the day, there's nothing we can do about it.\" He's right about that last part. This topic isn't going away anytime soon. Giannis said he's \"locked into\" the Bucks for this season but reserves the right to change his mind in \"six, seven months.\" He also had a case of selective amnesia and said he couldn't recall a meeting with managing governor Wes Edens where Edens claimed his franchise player expressed his commitment to the Bucks.  \nThe frustration the Bucks must feel concerning all this is understandable, but Rivers didn't have it quite right when he blamed the media for creating the story. The only thing that has to happen for all this to go away is for Giannis to publicly pull a Nikola Jokic. At media day, Joker said he wants to be a Nugget for life. Giannis could make a similar declaration with the Bucks and poof, no more story. He hasn't. That's telling -- and until and unless he does, this situation will be riding shotgun with the Bucks all season.  \n        \n            \n                NBA Top 100 players, ranked: How Nikola Jokić, SGA, Luka Dončić and more stack up as new season begins\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n4. Is this the end of LeBron James' All-NBA streak? LeBron made the All-NBA second team last season, extending his league record and marking the 21st consecutive year that he's made the cut. The only time he didn't make All-NBA was his rookie year. James is entering his 23rd season, moving him past Vince Carter for the longest career in NBA history. He'll also turn 41 in late December. He's already the oldest player to ever make an All-NBA team, but age isn't the only thing working against him here. \nLeBron didn't participate during training camp or the preseason due to sciatica on his right side, and he's expected to miss several weeks to begin the regular season. When Lakers head coach JJ Redick was asked when James might return, he told the media that James is \"on his own timeline.\" In order to even qualify for All-NBA honors, James has to appear in a minimum of 65 games. Last year he played in 70 games while the year before that he played in 71. But in the 2022-23 season he played in just 55 games, and the season before that he played in 56. How long he's out to start the season could go a long way to determining whether he's even eligible for awards and a record-extending 22nd straight All-NBA selection.  5. What Will Year 3 look like for Wemby?Victor Wembanyama's second season got off to a brilliant start. He was named to his first All-Star team and through 46 games he averaged 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and 3.7 assists while shooting 47.6% from the field and 83.6% from the line. There was some handwringing among some of my peers about his shot selection -- he took 8.8 three-point attempts per game and shot 35.2% -- but I found that less troublesome than most. Yes he's 7-foot-4 and has a length and height advantage against any defender, but he's only 21 years old and just now scratching the surface of what he can do on a basketball court. To me, those long 3s were like the raptors testing the electric fence for weaknesses in Jurassic Park. Once he figures out what he's capable of, the rest of the league is cooked. \nLast season Wembanyama posted the second game of his career where he went for 25+ points, 5+ rebounds, 5+ assists, 5+ steals and 5+ blocks. The only other player in NBA history to have more than one of those games was Hakeem Olajuwon. And if not for last season getting cut short when he was shut down due to deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder, Wembanyama was on an easy path to winning Defensive Player of the Year. Despite missing 36 games, he still led the league with 176 blocks -- 28 more than second-place Brook Lopez managed over 80 games -- and averaged over a steal per game. If he stays healthy and clears the 65-game threshold, he could put a stranglehold on DPOY for the foreseeable future.  The talent is undeniable, but is it enough to buoy the Spurs playoff prospects in an overloaded Western Conference? The oddsmakers have them pegged as a play-in team with San Antonio listed at +115 to make the Play-In Tournament on FanDuel.6. Who are the biggest threats to OKC in the West?The Thunder are the betting favorites (+125) to win the Western Conference again, but they'll have plenty of competition. Outside of the Jazz, probably every team in the conference has designs on at least being in the play-in mix. Whether that's realistic for the Blazers, Suns and Pelicans of the world is a different question than them being convinced they have a shot. Point is, as always, the West is stacked.  \nThe Nuggets have the second-best odds to win the West at +410. Denver took OKC to seven games in the second round of the playoffs last season — and that was before the organization addressed its glaring lack of depth this offseason by adding Bruce Brown, Tim Hardaway Jr and Jonas Valanciunas to the bench. Denver also said goodbye to Michael Porter Jr in a trade that brought back versatile wing Cam Johnson who should benefit nicely from playing alongside Nikola Jokic.  The Rockets have +1000 odds, and, after that, both L.A. teams are listed at +1100 to win the conference. The Clippers have one of the deepest rosters in the league after adding John Collins, Brook Lopez, Chris Paul and Bradley Beal to a team that won 50 games a year ago. The Lakers -- who finished as the No. 3 seed last season -- are much more top heavy by comparison, but that's less concerning when the top in question is Luka Doncic and LeBron. The Wolves (+1200) and Anthony Edwards have gone to back-to-back Western Conference Finals. And the Rockets, despite losing Fred VanVleet to a season-ending ACL injury, figure to once again have one of the best defenses in the NBA. They also addressed one of their biggest issues from last season by adding one of the game's best closing options when they acquired Kevin Durant in a trade that shipped Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks to Phoenix. There's more. The Golden State Warriors (+1700) will start the season with Jimmy Butler alongside Steph Curry, Draymond Green and new center Al Horford. That's six legitimate roadblocks in OKC's path to another parade. And we haven't even gotten to the Dallas Mavericks, who will try to stay afloat while waiting for Kyrie Irving to recover from an ACL injury, and the Memphis Grizzlies, who were a top-four team in the West for much of last season before nosediving in the final month and firing then-head coach Taylor Jenkins shortly before the playoffs.   \nThe Thunder are the defending champs and have the reigning MVP. But becoming the first repeat champ since the Warriors pulled it off in 2018 will be far from easy. When the question is whether to take the Thunder or the field, I'll take the field when it's this loaded -- with the Nuggets being the team that should give OKC the most cause for concern.  7. How Weak is the East? By comparison to the West, pretty weak. Or if you think weak is too harsh, at the very least it seems fairly top heavy with a ton of uncertainty for a lot of teams.   If we're doing the tiers thing -- and who doesn't love a good tier ranking? -- the Cavs (+200 to win the East) and the Knicks (+400) would have to be at the top. The Cavs had the best offense in the NBA last season and a top-10 defense. That's a pretty good formula for success. Yes they flamed out in the second round of the playoffs, but they ran into an underrated, white-hot Indiana Pacers team and Donovan Mitchell and especially Darius Garland weren't fully healthy. The Cavs are loaded again — four of five starters have been All-Stars, including last year's Defensive Player of the Year, Evan Mobley -- and have an excellent shot to win the conference. The Knicks said goodbye to Tom Thibodeau and hello to Mike Brown. Whatever you think of that decision, Brown is more likely to not run his starters into the ground during the regular season and also to use his bench, a unit the Knicks greatly improved during the offseason. A year ago, three of New York's five starters -- Mikal Bridges, Josh Hart and OG Anunoby -- all finished in the top 10 for total regular season minutes, with Bridges and Hart coming in first and second. Karl-Anthony Towns finished 27th. And despite getting hurt late in the season, Jalen Brunson still came in at 40th, logging more minutes in 65 games than Cleveland's Jarrett Allen did even though he played in all 82. Expect that to change this season. Same with actually using their beefed-up bench that now features useful offseason additions Jordan Clarkson and Guerschon Yabusele.  After that, the best odds to win the conference are the Magic (+650), Hawks (+950), Celtics (+1110) and Pistons (+1200). The Magic finished with the second-best defensive rating last season and absolutely suffocate opponents at that end of the floor. The problem for Orlando, as ever, was an anemic offense that finished in the bottom 10 for the 13th consecutive year. It didn't help that Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner and Jalen Suggs all suffered injuries last season. Suggs is still working his way back from a knee injury and it's unclear when he'll be available, but the other two are ostensibly healthy and the Magic added Desmond Bane to offer some much-needed offensive oomph. I'm as bullish on the Magic as anyone and have them finishing third in the conference, but I still need to see that offense level up before considering them a real threat to the Cavs and Knicks. The Hawks had an excellent offseason under new general manager Onsi Saleh, bringing in Kristaps Porziņģis, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Luke Kennard, not to mention fleecing Joe Dumars and snagging an unprotected 2026 draft pick from the Pelicans (better of New Orleans or Milwaukee) in one of the most lopsided trades in recent memory. The Celtics are without Jayson Tatum for most or all of this season as he recovers from an Achilles injury, and they moved on from Jrue Holiday, Luke Kennard and Porziņģis among others to avoid paying around $500 million for a team that is unlikely to win anything this season. And the Pistons more than tripled their win total last season year-over-year, becoming the first team in NBA history to do so. They also have one of the best young guards in the NBA in Cade Cunningham, who made his first All-NBA team.  These are nice enough teams that should have competitive seasons, but outside of the Cavs and Knicks (and maaaaaybe the Magic), if you picked them up and plopped them into the West would any of them be better than play-in hopefuls? And as flawed teams go, we haven't even gotten to the Bucks, Sixers, Pacers and Heat, all of which have their own well-documented issues. Which doesn't mean the East won't be entertaining, it just means that most of the marquee teams with legitimate championship aspirations are once again in the other conference.  \n            ",

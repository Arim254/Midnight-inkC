    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 college football bowl schedule features a Friday tripleheader, with the 2025 Rate Bowl serving as the middle matchup. It will see the Minnesota Golden Gophers (7-5) facing the New Mexico Lobos (9-3) in the programs' first-ever meeting. Minnesota is riding an eight-game bowl winning streak, which is the longest active in FBS and tied for the fourth-longest in history. New Mexico enters into the Rate Bowl 2025 on a six-game winning streak as this will be its first bowl game since 2016.Kickoff is at 4:30 p.m. ET from Chase Field in Phoenix. Both teams went undefeated at home this season, but neither posted a winning record outside of their home stadiums. The Golden Gophers are 1.5-point favorites in the latest New Mexico vs. Minnesota odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 42.5. Before making any Minnesota vs. New Mexico picks, check out the college football predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your $5+ bet wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, the model has set its sights on New Mexico vs. Minnesota.

The Over is a combined 8-3 for the squads in road/neutral-site games in 2025. Also, the recent history of this bowl has leaned way over the total as the last two Rate Bowls have each seen 85 combined points scored.Both squads are solid versus the run but sieves versus the pass. Each allows a completion rate of over 68%, which puts them among the worst seven teams out of the 136 FBS programs. Thus, one can expect both offenses to air it out, which leads to lots of points on the scoreboard. The model forecasts the Over to hit with plenty of points to spare as simulations call for 55 combined points. Thus, the Over hits more than 70% of the time.The model also says one side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Minnesota vs. New Mexico, and which side of the spread hits nearly 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the New Mexico vs. Minnesota spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's up on its top-ranked money-line picks, and find out.\n            ",

Stroud. Houston has the league's top defense, ranking first in both points allowed and yards allowed, and it's a defense that Justin Herbert knows all too well. In the Jan. 2025 playoff game between these teams, Houston picked off Herbert four times, which is one more pick than Herbert had in the entire 2024 regular season. Speaking of turnovers, the Texans have committed an NFL-low of five giveaways during their 10-2 run over their last dozen games, and they're on pace to be the first team in 17 years to not allow 250 passing yards in a game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Chargers can coverWhile the Texans have lost multiple games ATS during their winning streak, the same can't be said about L.A. which has covered in all four games of its four-game win streak. The Chargers have clinched a playoff spot, but they still has a huge incentive in front of them as they can get the No. 1 seed, and a bye, if they win out. Meanwhile, Los Angeles' defense has actually performed better than Houston's over the last two months as L.A. has given up a league-low of 254.5 total yards over the last eight games. The Chargers also have a big historical edge in regard to the spread, going 7-3 versus the line over their 10 all-time meetings. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Texans vs. Chargers picksSportsLine's model has simulated Chargers vs. Texans 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 42 combined points.

The Lions have won five of the last six matchups, but their spread success goes back beyond that. Detroit sports a 9-1 ATS record versus Minnesota over their last 10 meetings. Additionally, there's no greater discrepancy between these teams than what's arguably the most important statistic in football, and that's turnovers. The Lions have the fewest giveaways (eight) in the NFL, while the Vikings have the most (29). See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Vikings can coverMinnesota has found its groove as it has both outright won and covered in three straight games. The defense has been the catalyst as it had a season-high-tying of five sacks in Sunday's win over New York. Minnesota's defense also didn't allow a touchdown in that game, which came two weeks after pitching a shutout of Atlanta. The Vikings are on an amazing run of six straight games without giving up a passing score, and Justin Jefferson finally got going to help out the offense. He's coming off an 85-yard game, which is as many yards that he had over his previous four games combined and is his most yards since Week 5. His success could continue versus Detroit's No. 25 pass defense that has given up the fourth-most passing TDs. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Lions vs. Vikings picksSportsLine's model has simulated Vikings vs. Lions 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The presents have been cleared out from under the tree, and now college football bowl season has some more gifts to deliver with a trio of college football bowl games on Friday, Dec. 26. Northwestern takes on Central Michigan at 1 p.m. ET in the GameAbove Sports Bowl to begin the Friday college football action. Then, Minnesota squares off with New Mexico at 4:30 p.m. ET in the Rate Bowl, followed by UTSA vs. Florida International in the First Responder Bowl at 8 p.m. ET.Northwestern, Minnesota and UTSA are all favored in the latest college football odds, and the SportsLine projection model is backing all three favorites in its Friday college football best bets. Before locking in your college football picks, be sure to check out the top college football betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model and team of college football experts. New users can also target the all-new DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. College football best bets for Friday, Dec. 26 (odds subject to change): Northwestern (-10.5) vs. Central MichiganMinnesota (-2.5) vs. New Mexico UTSA (-5.5) vs. FIUCombining the model's three picks into a Friday college football parlay would result in a payout of +609 (risk $100 to win $609). Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Northwestern (-10.5) vs. Central Michigan Northwestern should have a significant talent advantage as a Big Ten school going up against a MAC program, despite a 6-6 record this season. Five of the Wildcats' six losses came in Big Ten play, though, and Central Michigan's one Big Ten matchup this season certainly didn't go well for the Chippewas. Central Michigan lost to Michigan, 63-3, in September. Northwestern was significantly more competitive in its matchup against the Wolverines this season, losing 24-22 in November. Central Michigan is coming off a 21-3 loss to Toledo in its final MAC game as well. The model projects Northwestern to win in 54% of simulations. Back Northwestern at BetMGM, where new users receive up to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet loses:Minnesota (-2.5) vs. New Mexico Minnesota closed its season with a 17-7 win over Wisconsin to finish 7-5, including 5-4 in the Big Ten. New Mexico went 9-3, but the competition in the Mountain West doesn't compare to the Big Ten as a whole. Even though New Mexico went 6-2 in the Mountain West, four of those six wins came in one-score games. The Gophers should have the talent advantage, and they've been unbeatable in bowl games under head coach P.J. Fleck. Literally unbeatable. Minnesota is 6-0 in bowl games over Fleck's first eight years as head coach, and that's a trend the model expects to continue on Friday. The model projects Minnesota to win in 63% of simulations. Back Minnesota at FanDuel, where new users get $250 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:UTSA (-5.5) vs. FIU UTSA has a top-20 offense in college football this season, ranking 19th at 32.5 points per game this season. The Roadrunners' offense is orchestrated by a familiar last name for football fans, with Owen McCown as the team's QB1. McCown is the son of Josh McCown, who had a 16-year NFL career at quarterback. Owen McCown threw for 2,700 yards, but he wasn't a one-man show. Running back Robert Henry Jr. rushed for 1,045 yards on 6.9 yards per rush, which ranked ninth in college football. Meanwhile, Florida International is allowing 29.5 ppg this season, which ranks 90th in the nation. The model projects UTSA to cover in 60% of simulations. Bet UTSA at FanDuel, where new users get $250 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Want more Friday college football picks?You've seen the model's college football best bets for Friday's bowl games.

White said. \"Getting to the Over will depend on how well Minnesota moves the ball, and the Detroit defense, with its secondary injuries, has been awful of late, with seven of eight games since the bye getting to 50 points and four up to 60-plus. Max Brosmer didn't look as lost in relief duty last week and even had some rapport with Justin Jefferson, so this is a game where I see both teams getting into the 20s.\"  Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Lakers vs. Rockets: Over 229.5 total points (-110)Each of the Lakers and Rockets games on Tuesday went Over this total, with both teams displaying awful defense in lopsided losses. The Lakers allowed 132 points to the Suns, while the Rockets allowed 128 points to the Clippers. The Rockets have allowed at least 125 points in four of their last five games, while the Lakers have allowed at least 132 points in three of their last five games. Both teams feature elite offensive playmakers, such as Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Kevin Durant, leading the model to project the Over to hit in 65.1% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Chiefs (+13.5) vs. Broncos (-112)Yes, the Chiefs are down to their third-string quarterback, but they still have Andy Reid as the playcaller and offensive guru to get the most out of Chris Oladokun. The seventh-round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft didn't look completely lost in his relief of Gardner Minshew, who left with a knee injury, last week. Oladokun completed 11 of 16 passes for 111 yards. The Chiefs won't want to be embarrassed against a rival in front of a huge audience, and although the Broncos are 12-3 on the season, they haven't dominated teams they were expected to. Denver has one-score wins against the Titans, Jets, Giants, Commanders and Raiders this season, and only two of their wins all season have come by more than one score.

    "body": "\n        Eleven 2025-26 college football bowl games and four playoff matchup are in the books, but some bowl confidence pools remain open for entries or modifications as there are around 30 matchups remaining to make college football bowl picks on before the curtain closes on this season. The biggest remaining college football spread has Utah as a 15.5-point favorite over Nebraska in the Las Vegas Bowl on Wednesday, Dec. 31 as Kyle Whittingham will coach his final game for the Utes. While putting faith in big favorites is a part of just about everyone's college football bowl confidence strategy, correctly predicting a couple upsets can give you a big edge in any football pools. Anticipated matchups outside of the CFP include Penn State vs. Clemson (-3), Vanderbilt (-5.5) vs. Iowa, Georgia Tech vs. BYU (-4), Tennessee vs. Illinois (+2.5) and Michigan vs. Texas (-7.5). Before making any college football predictions for bowl season, be sure to see the latest college football bowl confidence picks from SportsLine's proven model.New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $75 in site credits when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times, and it is 31-19 on its top-rated college football money-line picks since the beginning of the 2024 season. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest college football odds and 2025-26 bowl season college football betting for confidence pools. Head here to see every pick. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Top 2025-26 college football bowl confidence picks  One of the model's most confident picks is that No. 16 USC (-6.5), who will have quarterback Jayden Maiava, gets a comfortable win over TCU in the Alamo Bowl on Dec. 30. USC went 9-3 in the regular season, with all three defeats coming versus ranked teams. TCU found itself in the Top 25 once -- back in September -- before having a pedestrian run through the Big 12 schedule, finishing 5-4. Even with the Horned Frogs playing in the easier conference than the Trojans, USC both averaged more points and allowed fewer points per game. USC sports a 32-9 (78%) straight-up record when favored since Lincoln Riley came aboard in 2022, as it is projected to easily take care of business in San Antonio. SportsLine's model has the Trojans prevailing 70% of the time. See all of the model's college football bowl confidence picks here.Another one of the bowl confidence predictions the model is high on: Northwestern (-10.5) handles Central Michigan in the GameAbove Sports Bowl on Dec. 26. Central Michigan struggled mightily against Power 4 opponents this year, losing 63-3 to Michigan and 45-17 to Pittsburgh. Northwestern went just 6-6 this year, but that was largely thanks to a very tough Big Ten schedule that included Oregon, Michigan, USC and Illinois. For comparison, Northwestern lost to Michigan by two points on a last-second field goal. The model has Northwestern winning nearly 80% of the time, making the Wildcats the clear side to back. See the rest of the college football bowl confidence predictions here. How to make college football bowl confidence picksThe model has also made the call on who wins every other bowl game.

The pact includes a club option for an eighth year and escalators that can push the total value to $131 million.Soderstrom, 24, is coming off a breakout season. He hit .276/.346/.474 with 25 home runs and 93 runs batted in. His contributions were worth an estimated 4.3 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations.Soderstrom's 126 OPS+ ranked third among A's regulars, behind first baseman and American League Rookie of the Year Award winner Nick Kurtz and catcher Shea Langeliers. The A's ranked sixth in the AL in runs scored, trailing five playoff teams: the New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Seattle Mariners, and Detroit Tigers.Soderstrom, who was already under team control through the 2029 season, is now in possession of the largest contract in Athletics franchise history. That distinction previously belonged to right-hander Luis Severino, a free-agent signing from last winter who inked a three-year pact worth $67 million.\nThe A's are slated to enter their second season since departing Oakland as part of a multi-city relocation route. They spent last year and will spend the next few years in Sacramento until a ballpark is constructed in Las Vegas.\n            \n    ",

The Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets were built by the same general manager, Tim Connelly. They faced off in the 2024 playoffs, where Minnesota ended Denver's championship defense with a second-round upset. Every year, they seem to play in a thriller or two. Last year, the Timberwolves stole a double overtime victory on a terrible Russell Westbrook shooting foul.Neither team is quite at its peak. Denver is still dealing with injuries to Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun. Minnesota is still adjusting to life without Nickeil Alexander-Walker. But these are still both Western Conference contenders, and any game between the two of them is a deserving marquee regular-season event. Below is our pick against the spread as well as the best prop bet for the Christmas finale.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTimberwolves at Nuggets: Where to watchTime: 10:30 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Ball Arena -- DenverTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Nuggets -3.5, O/U: 238.5 (via BetMGM) Timberwolves at Nuggets: Prediction, odds, best bets\nDenver's depth has improved significantly this season, but the injuries are just becoming too much to overcome against a great opponent like Minnesota. Aaron Gordon and Christian Braun are still out, and on Tuesday, Cam Johnson suffered a knee injury that we don't know the extent of yet, but should leave Denver without a third starter for at least some period of time. The Timberwolves always get up for Nuggets games and they've now won 10 of their last 12, including statement wins over the Knicks and Thunder. They're the safer pick with the points. The Pick: Timberwolves +3.5\nI'll admit my instinct was to pick Nikola Jokić's scoring over to account for his missing teammates, but no team limits his shot total better than Minnesota. Outside of his 61-point gem last season, which came without Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. and took two overtimes, Jokić has averaged just 15.4 shot attempts per game against Minnesota over the past two regular seasons. So I'm going the other way and expecting a more balanced offensive night for the three-time MVP. The Pick: Jokić Under 29.5 Points\n            \n    ",

The Dallas Mavericks haven't exactly been lighting the world on fire either, but they're trending in the right direction, and if he keeps growing as much as he has thus far this season, Cooper Flagg has a whole lot more Christmas basketball ahead of him.Given how far down the Western Conference standings both the Mavericks and Warriors have fallen, this is actually a critical game from a play-in and standings perspective. To get you ready, we'll post our best bets below, both against the spread and in terms of props.Mavericks at Warriors: Where to watchTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Chase Center -- San FranciscoTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Warriors -8, O/U: 227.5 (via FanDuel) \n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMavericks at Warriors: Prediction, odds, best bets\nThe Warriors have played nine games thus far in December. They've won just two of them by eight or more points. Draymond Green mysteriously disappeared after a heated exchange with Steve Kerr on Monday. Nobody on this team but Stephen Curry is scoring consistently. Golden State shouldn't be favored by eight points against anyone, let alone a Mavericks team that is frankly playing just about as well as they are. The Pick: Mavericks +8\nHere's a fun fact for you: Cooper Flagg already has 68 points in the clutch. That's almost halfway to the recorded rookie record (138 by Brandon Jennings). The point is that Flagg seems comfortable in big moments. He's going to relish the chance to put on a show against a living legend in Stephen Curry on his home court in a marquee Christmas game. I'm fully expecting him to meet the moment. The Pick: Flagg Over 19.5 Points\n            \n    ",

The going is unlikely to get much easier on Saturday, as Jackson is listed as doubtful to play against the Green Bay Packers in Week 17.Jackson was estimated as a non-participant in Tuesday's walkthrough and did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday. Now Jackson is considered a long shot to play Saturday in Green Bay with the Ravens (7-8) potentially facing elimination from playoff contention with a loss. If Jackson can't play, Tyler Huntley will get the start -- his second of the season. The Ravens have reached the postseason the last three seasons but haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know this year. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later. Previously, Jackson was 16-0.Jackson, the two-time MVP, was injured in the second quarter against the Patriots on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from safety Craig Woodson. \nJackson, who struggled to walk out of the locker room after the game, admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game. \"It's BS, bro,\" Jackson said. \"I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.\"\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 17 NFL picks: Bills beat Eagles in shootout, Packers eliminate Ravens, Raiders win and lose\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Huntley replaced Jackson under center and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.\n\"My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,\" Jackson said. \"Pain.

It's two of the Western Conference elite slugging it out with major playoff standing implications at stake.So let's prepare for one of the best games on the Christmas slate with some best bets. Below are our picks against the spread and for the game's best prop bet.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRockets at Lakers: Where to watchTime: 8 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Crypto.com Arena -- Los AngelesTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Rockets -3, O/U: 230.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) Rockets at Lakers: Prediction, odds, best bets\nThe Lakers are very banged up right now. Luka Dončić missed Tuesday's game. DeAndre Ayton just came back from a brief injury absence. So did Austin Reaves, and LeBron James is nearly 41, so it's safe to assume he's never quite at 100% anymore. That's exactly where you don't want to be heading into a matchup against the ultra-physical Rockets. The Lakers have had trouble with bigger, athletic teams all season. That's their weakness. Until they prove that they can overcome it, I'm expecting the Rockets to bully them in this one. The Pick: Rockets -3\nThe Lakers have holes all over their defense, but nowhere is it more glaring than in the backcourt. They are incredibly vulnerable against smaller, fast guards, and only the Clippers and Jazz are allowing a higher 3-point percentage on above-the-break 3s. In other words, I'm expecting the Lakers to build their game-plan around stopping the Rockets in the paint, and in the process Reed Sheppard will have a field day from deep. The Pick: Reed Sheppard Over 2.5 3s\n            \n    ",

One of those favorites, the New York Knicks, has more than lived up to the billing. They won the NBA Cup earlier this month and are hovering around a 60-win pace under new head coach Mike Brown. The other, the Cleveland Cavaliers, have struggled quite a bit more. After losing just 18 games all season a year ago, the Cavaliers are in danger of reaching that total in January this season. With Darius Garland and Jarrett Allen underwhelming and nobody's shots falling, Cleveland's contender status is in serious doubt. The Cavs enter Christmas with a 17-14 record and in seventh place in the East.How could they get their season back on track? A marquee win over the Knicks would be a good start. So to prepare for the Christmas action, below are our best bets for Knicks-Cavs, both against the spread and through props.\n        \n            \n                Bold predictions for each NBA Christmas Day game: Thunder-Spurs tension, a Curry flurry and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCavaliers at Knicks: Where to watchTime: 12 p.m. ET | Date: Thursday, Dec. 25Location: Madison Square Garden -- New YorkTV channel: ABC/ESPN | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Odds: Knicks -6.5, O/U: 239.5 (via DraftKings) Cavaliers at Knicks odds, prediction, best bet\nHas Cleveland really righted the ship, or the Cavaliers just making their shots? They've won their last two games, but allowed 250 points in the process. Those wins came because they took 93 3-pointers and made 44 of them. Now, Cleveland lived off of its shooting a season ago, but there are still major problems here. Darius Garland is starting to right the ship, but with Evan Mobley dealing with a calf strain, it'd be hard to pick against a Knicks team that's rolling at home in a marquee game even with some injuries of their own. Jalen Brunson sat on Tuesday for load-management purposes, so he should be good to go in this one. The Pick: Knicks -6\nMitchell Robinson averaged just under 10 rebounds per game when the Knicks played the Cavaliers in the 2023 playoffs. He's faced them three times since then in the regular season and pulled in 30 total rebounds. He just has a way of bullying Jarrett Allen, who was so shaken after that playoff series that he admitted \"the lights were brighter than expected.\" So I'm not overthinking this one. Expect Robinson to own the glass. The Pick: Robinson Over 7.5 Rebounds\n            \n    ",

That may not be the case this year as the Sabres work their way onto the nice list with a seven-game winning streak.Earlier this season, I buried the Sabres in these very power rankings, and I underestimated how long the Eastern Conference standings would be a compressed mess. The difference between last place and second place is a mere 10 points.That has opened the door for any team lucky enough to get hot at the right time, and the Sabres have seized upon that opening with a nice run just in time for Christmas. Buffalo is now just three points out of a playoff spot with a game in hand, and it feels like belief is starting to build.Over this stretch, Alex Lyon has stepped up as the No. 1 option in net with 3.94 goals saved above average, and Tage Thompson has tallied four goals and four assists. Rasmus Dahlin has also caught fire from the blue line with two goals and six assists while playing lights out defense.\nIn a wide open Eastern Conference, why can't the Sabres get hot and end their 14-season playoff drought? That's what fans are asking themselves as they get a little hope in their stockings this Christmas.With that in mind, here are the updated NHL Power Rankings with one Christmas wish for each team.\nAll expected goals and goals saved above average data courtesy of Natural Stat Trick.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                9\n            \n                Sabres\n            \n                7\n            \n                Maple Leafs\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Avalanche\n                                \n                            Power play prowess | The only thing this Avalanche team doesn't do well is score on the power play, which boggles the mind.

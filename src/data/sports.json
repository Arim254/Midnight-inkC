The model entered the 2026 NFL playoffs on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.Monday Wild Card Weekend betting preview, picksSteelers (+3) vs. TexansThe strength of the AFC North is a driving force behind this line, but the fact remains that Pittsburgh is an incredibly hostile environment, and Houston hasn't won a road playoff game in franchise history. Aaron Rodgers will be making his 22nd career playoff start on Monday, and he'll have the experience advantage even though C.J. Stroud has quickly piled up postseason reps (this is his fifth start in only his third season). DK Metcalf is back from suspension and T.J. Watt is healthy at the right time, which are big reasons why the model says that the Steelers cover in 53% of simulations. Bet on the Steelers at FanDuel, where new users get $300 if your first bet of at least $5 wins:Over 38.5 pointsThe Texans ranked second in the NFL in scoring defense and first in total defense this season, and Rodgers isn't as menacing at 42 as he was even four years ago when he ripped off back-to-back NFL MVPs. However, the Steelers have still managed to score 25 points or more in nine of their last 12 games, and the Houston offense has also produced 36 points or more on four occasions this season. If this game opens up even a little bit, this number could be in the rear-view in a hurry, and the model predicts that the Over hits in 55% of simulations. Bet the Over at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get your first bet up to $250 in bonus bets, whether it wins or loses.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        The Philadelphia Eagles will not be repeating as Super Bowl champions this year, as they suffered a 23-19 loss to Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers in the wild card round of the NFL playoffs. Jalen Hurts had a chance to lead a game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter, but couldn't move the chains on a fourth-and-11 at the 49ers' 21-yard line. Wide receiver A.J. Brown was a major storyline in this matchup, as he caught three of seven targets for just 25 yards and did not make a catch in the final three quarters. Brown also had a couple of uncharacteristic drops and had to be separated from coach Nick Sirianni late in the first half following one of those drops on a third down. Check out what happened:\nAt the halftime break, Sirianni told sideline reporter Erin Andrews, \"Emotions, they run high especially in the playoffs.\" After the game, Sirianni told reporters that he ran down the sideline towards Brown in an attempt to get him off the field since they were about to punt the ball away. This was also hypothesized by NFL Media's Mike Garafolo. \"I love A.J., I think he knows how I feel about him,\" Sirianni said after the game. \"I have a special relationship with him. We've probably went through every emotion you can possibly have together. We've laughed together, we've cried together, we've yelled at each other, we're both emotional.\"\nWhile Sirianni spoke to reporters following the conclusion of Philly's season, Brown did not. Brown hugged his teammates in the locker room and then left without taking questions, per the Philly Voice.What happened Sunday very well could have rubbed the Eagles' fan base the wrong way. Brown has been critical of Philly's offense multiple times this year, and then did not produce with the season on the line.\nIn November, Brown said on a live stream that he had been struggling and joked that fantasy football players should drop him. When streamer jankyrondo asked Brown how he was, he said this:\n\"No. Where have you been?\" Brown replied with a laugh. \"Family's good. Everything else? No. It's a shit show. You on some 'How you been?' I've been struggling, brother.\"  What's more, Brown did not back down from those comments when asked about them in the locker room the very next day.\"I think that's fair. I think if you've got eyes, you can see that,\" Brown said. \"The same things I've been saying all season. So me making light of my situation on Twitch with my friend, that's something I'm not apologizing for, you know? Because like I said, if you've got eyes, you can see that. Shoot, that's me trying to laugh through my situation.\"\nBrown maintained that the source of his frustration was not about targets, but about the efficiency of the unit at large.\"I think if we're really focused on winning and doing our job, we can't just keep slapping a Band-Aid over the defense doing their job and getting us out of trouble,\" Brown said. \"At what point are we going to pick up our slack as an offense? We're so great, and that's what I'm getting at. It's not about I don't care about winning or all I care about is stats. No. It's been week after week -- sometimes we're not doing our job on offense. So you can't just keep slapping a Band-Aid over that and expect to win late in the year -- it's not going to happen.\"Last year, what it was, thank you for the ring, but it's a new season. They adapted. We have to adapt and continue to get better and try to find new ways. That's where the frustration comes in. It's not about winning, you guys. I want to win, yes. I want to help contribute as well, do our thing on offense as well. I think that's fair.\"\nIn 15 regular-season games this year, Brown caught 78 passes for 1,003 yards and seven touchdowns. He has topped 1,000 receiving yards in all four of his seasons with the Eagles, but this year's 1,003 marked his lowest total in Philadelphia. Brown got his fair share of targets Sunday but did not capitalize.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There have been a lot of incredible comebacks in the NFL and football fans were treated to another one in the wild card round of the 2025 NFL Playoffs. The Chicago Bears were down 21-3 against the Green Bay Packers at halftime and rallied from an 18-point deficit to advance to the divisional round.It seemed like the Packers were going to run away with it and defeat their divisional opponents on the road, up 21-6 through three quarters, but as Bears quarterback Caleb Williams reminded everyone after the victory, games are 60 minutes.The Bears were prepared to play hard until the final whistle, using another historic comeback as a reminder that games aren't over until the clock says 0:00. Bears coach Ben Johnson told reporters after the playoff win that during training camp he showed his players the New England Patriots' 25-point Super Bowl comeback over the Atlanta Falcons. He used it as a reminder to not give in, even with a large deficit.The Bears have two players on their current roster that were part of Super Bowl LI nine years ago. Guard Joe Thuney was on the Patriots and defensive tackle Grady Jarrett was on the Falcons. Back in 2017, the Patriots flipped a 28-3 deficit into a 34-28 overtime victory. Both players were asked to share their experiences from the game and Johnson believes the team found value in their stories.\"It was just great to get perspective from both of those players of how that game went down. I think it's just a good lesson to be learned that its 28-3 in the middle of the third quarter and yet the game is still being played and there's a lot of time left,\" Johnson said on Saturday.\n\"That was my message to the group,\" Johnson continued. \"Was just reminding them that this has been done before. And rather than saying 'woe is me' and 'oh, crap, we're in a hole,' it's more of an opportunity for us to turn this thing around into a game that we'll never forget. And that's what they did.\"The message clearly worked, because Chicago outscored Green Bay 25-6 in the fourth quarter to win their first playoff game in 15 years.The comebacks by the Patriots and Bears do have one thing in common: Matt LaFleur was on the losing sideline in both games. LaFleur was a quarterbacks coach for the 2025 Falcons, and he, of course, is the current Packers coach. LaFleur is now part of the largest blown lead in Falcons history and the largest blown lead in Packers postseason history.\nThe 2026 season is set to be the final year of LaFleur's current deal and the team will benefit by making a decision on his future sooner than later.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Boston Celtics fell two possessions short in one of their biggest games of the season thus far: a 100-95 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Notable in the defeat was a free throw discrepancy in which the Spurs made 10 more foul shots (14) than the Celtics even attempted (four). Celtics star Jaylen Brown took exception to the distribution of whistles in the loss and after the game unleashed a minute-and-a-half-long diatribe against the officials.Brown, who scored 27 points but did not go to the charity stripe once, called out official Curtis Blair by name and lamented the \"inconsistency\" in the amount of contact allowed on the two ends of the floor.\"I'll accept the fine at this point,\" Brown said. \"I thought it was some bulls---- tonight. I think they're a good defensive team, but they ain't that damn good. I hope somebody could just pull up the clips, because it's the same s--- every time we play a good team. It's like, they refuse to make a call, and they call touch-fouls on the other end. That's just extremely frustrating, bro.\"The foul totals themselves were not dramatically out of balance, as Boston was whistled 18 times to San Antonio's 13. But the majority of the Celtics' infractions sent the Spurs to the line, and their 20 free throw attempts were a factor in the game's outcome. Brown himself was guilty of four fouls, which tied a game-high.\"We play hard,\" Brown said. \"We are outplaying our expectations. We compete hard on the defensive end. They reward the other team with touch-fouls, and we go down there and guys are allowed to get away with it. Somebody, please, pull it up. Every time we play a good team the inconsistency is crazy. I'll take the f----ing fine. Curtis (Blair), all them dudes, was terrible tonight. I don't care; they can fine me whatever they want. It's crazy. Every time we play a good team, it's the same bulls---. Somebody, please, pull up the clips.\"\nThe loss knocked the Celtics out of sole possession of the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference, as they now share the standing with the New York Knicks at an identical 24-14. Even with the defeat, Boston is in a much better position than the vast majority of prognosticators foresaw before the campaign.Despite the absence of the injured Jayson Tatum and the flurry of offseason moves that sent key contributors out of town, the Celtics are squarely in the race for the East's top seed.\"I'm irate at how they officiated the game today,\" Brown said. \"If we can't get to the free throw line, and teams are allowed to be physical and bump us off our spots, et cetera, then it's hard to win games like that. We shot four free throws tonight and lost the game by four. Not to say that's the whole game, the whole story. We gotta be better in spots. But g--damn, like, I'm driving to the basket, I'm physical, I don't flop, I don't shy away from contact, I go up strong, I'm athletic, and nothing. I had zero free throws tonight. The inconsistency is f----ing crazy.\"\nBrown is in the midst of a career year and is on pace to set a personal best in scoring with his 29.5 points per game. His usage has skyrocketed with Tatum on the shelf, and he leads the NBA with 16.1 2-point attempts per contest.\n            ",

Matthew Stafford threw a 19-yard touchdown pass with just 38 seconds left to lead the Rams to a 34-31 comeback win over the Panthers. In the second game, the Bears stormed back from an 18-point halftime deficit to stun the Packers, 31-27. Caleb Williams threw a 25-yard scoring pass with just under two minutes left to play for the game-winning score. The win for the Bears was the largest postseason comeback in franchise history. It was also the third-largest fourth quarter comeback in NFL playoff history. After a wild opening day, the drama continued on Sunday with the Bills pulling off a 27-24 win over the Jaguars in a game that saw four lead changes in the fourth quarter. The Bills will now head to the divisional round for the sixth straight year. In the second game on Sunday, there was more madness with the 49ers pulling off the biggest upset of the opening round with a 23-19 win over the Eagles. With San Francisco's win, that ends Philadelphia's bid to become the NFC's first repeat Super Bowl champ in more than 30 years. It also means that the NFC West is now just the second division over the past 25 years to send three teams to the divisional round. The 49ers will be joining the Rams and Seahawks. The nightcap on Sunday was the only game that didn't really have any drama with the Patriots rolling to a 16-3 win over the Chargers. With New England's win, seven of the eight spots in the divisional round have now been filled. The last spot will go to the winner of Monday's game between the Texans and Steelers. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule, including the dates for the divisional round.Wild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) Packers\nPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more.

    "body": "\n        It's been a historical year for the NFC West and after an impressive regular season, the division is now making some serious noise in the playoffs. With the Rams and 49ers both winning on Wild Card Weekend, that means the NFC West will now be sending three teams to the divisional round this year. San Francisco and Los Angeles will be joined by the Seattle Seahawks, who earned a bye to the divisional round as the No. 1 overall seed in the NFC. This marks just the second time over the past 25 years, and fourth time ever, that one division has sent three teams to the divisional round. The last time it happened came back in 2022 when the NFC East sent the Giants, Cowboys and Eagles to the divisional. Before that, no team had sent three teams to the divisional round since 1997. \n        \n            \n                2026 NFL playoff schedule and bracket: Dates, times, TV for every round from divisional to Super Bowl\n                \n                    John Breech                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOf the three previous divisions that have sent three teams to the divisional round, only one of them produced a Super Bowl champion. Let's take a look: \nDivisionTeamsWin Super Bowl?1992 NFC East(2) Cowboys, (5) Eagles, (6) WashingtonYes (Cowboys beat Bills in Super Bowl)1997 NFC Central(2) Packers, (4) Buccaneers, (6) VikingsNo (Packers lost in Super Bowl)2022 NFC East(1) Eagles, (5) Cowboys, (6) GiantsNo (Eagles lose in Super Bowl)As you can see, every division that has put three teams in the divisional round has ended up sending a team to the Super Bowl, but the 1992 NFC East was the only one to produce a Super Bowl winner. It's also worth noting that none of the three previous divisions even sent two teams to the conference title game, so if the NFC West can pull that off, the division will once again make history. The NFC West will definitely be sending at least one team to the NFC Championship game and that's because the 49ers and Seahawks will be playing each other in the divisional round. It will mark the third meeting this year between the division rivals: The 49ers won 17-13 back in Week 1, but the Seahawks won the big one in Week 18, clinching the No. 1 overall seed with a 13-3 win over San Francisco. The Seahawks opened as a 6.5-point favorite over the sixth-seeded 49ers. As for the Rams, they'll be traveling to Chicago to face the Bears with a trip to the NFC title game on the line. The fifth-seeded Rams were able to sneak out of the wild card round after beating the Panthers 34-31 thanks to a late touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford. The Rams have opened as a 4.5-point favorite, which is somewhat notable, because teams tend to struggle in that spot. This game will mark just the 11th time over the past 50 years that a road team has been favored by four points or more in a playoff game and the favored team has gone 0-10 against the spread and just 4-6 straight-up, according to Pro Football Reference. If the Rams win, we'll be guaranteed an all NFC West conference title game. \nThe NFC West has been making history all year. The Seahawks (14-3), Rams (12-5) and 49ers (12-5) all won at least 12 games, marking the first time in NFL history that a single division has produced three teams that won at least 12 games. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Charlotte Hornets handed out a demoralizing 150-95 beatdown to the Utah Jazz Saturday night, which even if there weren't NFL playoff games going on still probably wouldn't garnered a ton of attention. Given both teams have losing records and likely will be headed back to the draft lottery again in the spring, there's not going to be a ton of interest in a matchup between these two squads.But the final score is enough to want to dig into things and ask, \"Wow, what happened?\" In short, the Hornets were just automatic on offense. They took 59 3s and and made 40% of them. They shot 52.5% from the floor over the entire game. It wasn't a case of a single player going off for a massive stat line, no every member of the Hornets who played -- which was literally every active player on the roster -- put up points. Nine players scored in double figures for the Hornets, with only one player, Tre Mann, eclipsing the 20-point mark. Meanwhile, the Jazz couldn't buy a bucket from beyond the arc, shooting an abysmal 22.6% from deep. And when you're trading 2s for 3s on the other end, things can get out of hand quickly.But the final score doesn't really do it justice for how jaw-dropping this win was for the Hornets. To give it even more context, second-year forward Cody Williams, who played 33 minutes for the Jazz, finished the game with a plus-minus of -60. For those unaware, plus-minus tells us how a team does when that specific player is on the floor. So a positive number signals that the team is outscoring their opponent by that much when that player is on the court, a negative number means their team is getting outscored by that amount. Williams played the most of any other player for Utah, so with him on the floor the Jazz were basically getting outscored by 60 points.With the final score being what it was, yep, that's pretty accurate. Williams' terrible feat makes it the worst single game plus-minus in NBA history, beating the previous record of -58, which was held by both Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Scoot Henderson. \nPlayerDate+/-Cody Williams (Utah Jazz)1/10/2026-60Jeremiah Robinson-Earl (New Orleans Pelicans)4/11/2025-58Scoot Henderson (Portland Trail Blazers)3/29/2024-58Manny Harris (Cleveland Cavaliers)1/11/2011-57Keion Brooks Jr. (New Orleans Pelicans)4/11/2025-56The NBA didn't start tracking play-by-play data until the 1996-97 season, so it certainly leaves room for there to be an even worse mark prior to that. But Williams now holds the new record in the play-by-play era, a record no player wants to hold.As bad as the Jazz played defensively, though, because there was no single player who took over on offense for the Hornets, there's no record setting plus-minus number on Charlotte's side. The highest plus-minus is from Moussa Diabate who had a +38 plus-minus. But that doesn't come close to the single game all-time record. That feat goes to Luc Mbah a Moute during the 2017-18 season, when he recorded a +57 plus-minus after playing 26 minutes and putting up 13 points, four rebounds and four steals. PlayerDate+/-Luc Mbah a Moute (Houston Rockets)11/22/2017+57Gary Trent Jr. (Toronto Raptors)4/2/2021+54Oso Ighodaro (Phoenix Suns)11/13/2025+52Santi Aldama (Memphis Grizzlies)12/2/2021+52Joe Smith (Minnesota Timberwolves)11/8/2001+52That may come as a surprise to many who might've expected someone like Nikola Jokic or another ultra efficient offensive engine to hold that record, but plus-minus goes far beyond just counting stats. It takes into account things that don't show up on a boxscore, like well-timed screens that lead to a bucket, making the right reads defensively or making the extra pass to set up a teammate on offense. It shows which players make the most impact on both ends of the floor beyond just scoring, grabbing rebounds or dishing out assists.\nUnfortunately for Williams, despite putting up 15 points in the loss, he wasn't helping the Jazz in other areas that translated to winning. But no one on Utah's team was, so while he will hold the record, every member of the Jazz should wear this badge of dishonor and let it motivate them to ensure a performance like this never happens again. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In his final appearance on \"The NFL Today,\" outgoing CBS Sports NFL analyst and former quarterback Matt Ryan spoke about his desire to reshape the Atlanta Falcons into a contender after accepting the franchise's new position of president of football.Atlanta hasn't made the playoffs since the 2017 season -- when Ryan was still quarterbacking. The Falcons say that Ryan will \"oversee all aspects of football for the organization,\" and that both the head coach and general manager, when hired, will report to him.\"You want to be in the mix, in the playoffs, and it's been too long there,\" Ryan said on Sunday's show. \"We're going to work really hard and find the right people to get us back into that position to be successful. You guys know it, football is about the people. The building is about the people, there's a lot of really good people in that building that are already there. It starts at the top with Arthur Blank and I'm fortunate to be in this position, excited about the opportunity and ready to get started.\"\nThe former NFL MVP served as a game analyst for one season with CBS Sports before transitioning to the studio on \"The NFL Today\" for the last two years. It's nearly impossible to decline a \"President of Football\" gig, but at the same time it wasn't easy for Ryan to walk away from his current role.\nRyan said that when he retired following the 2023 season there was a void that was created by leaving the game and no longer having teammates or that sense of belonging. Ryan spoke from the heart about the difficulty that can take place in filling that space, but Ryan expressed gratitude for having a new set of teammates at the network over the last three years. \"When I left [the Falcons] I was so lucky to be given the opportunity by [CBS Sports president] David Berson and by CBS to become a part of this team.\"\nRyan played 15 NFL seasons, 14 with the Falcons and one with the Indianapolis Colts. He is the Falcons' all-time leader in passing yards (59,735), passing touchdowns (367) and games won (120). Ryan made four Pro Bowls, and was named NFL MVP in 2016 after throwing for 4,944 yards, 38 touchdowns and seven interceptions.\n\"Throughout his remarkable 14-year career in Atlanta, Matt's leadership, attention to detail, knowledge of the game and unrelenting drive to win made him the most successful player in our franchise's history,\" team owner Arthur Blank said in a statement. \"I am confident those same qualities will be a tremendous benefit to our organization as he steps into this new role. From his playing days to his time as an analyst at CBS, Matt has always been a student of the game, and he brings an astute understanding of today's NFL, as well as unique knowledge of our organization and this market. I have full confidence and trust in Matt as we strive to deliver a championship caliber team for Atlanta and Falcons fans everywhere.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the fourth consecutive time, the Supercopa de España will come down to an El Clásico between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona took down Athletic Club in a 5-0 rout in the semifinals while Real Madrid squeezed by Atletico Madrid by a 2-1 score in Xabi Alonso's first season as manager of the club. He'll now have a chance to win his first trophy, and it could be a significant one.The last four winners of the Supercopa de España have then gone on to win LaLiga at the end of the season, so while Barcelona have a four-point lead domestically, Real Madrid triumphing on Sunday could deal a psychological blow to Hansi Flick's side. Each Clásico is a compelling installment in this rivalry, and the latest could be one that defines the season. Let's take a look at some things to watch during the match:How to watch Barcelona vs. Real Madrid, oddsDate: Sunday, Jan. 11 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: Alinma Bank Stadium at King Abdullah Sport City -- Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Odds: Barcelona -105; Draw +290; Real Madrid +250Predicted linuepsGiven injuries, there will be plenty of decisions for both coaches, but the biggest is whether Kylian Mbappe will play as he suffers from a knee injury. Odds are that he won't, but with this being a final versus a rival, Alosno could push to have his strongest side available. Barcelona: Joan Garcia, Alejandro Balde, Pau Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Jules Kounde, Frenkie De Jong, Pedri, Lamine Yamal, Dani Olmo, Raphinha, Ferran TorresReal Madrid: Thibaut Courtois, Álvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen, Raul Ascencio, Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Aurélien Tchouaméni, Vinícius Júnior, Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo, Gonzalo García\nRodrygo is neededKylian Mbappe is going to be brought to Saudi Arabia for the final as the French forward deals with a knee injury, but that doesn't mean he'll feature in the final. Even if it's for gamesmanship, it's good to have Mbappe in Saudi Arabia just to give Flick something to think about, but Gonzalo Garcia has shown that he can lead the line in a pinch, and someone who stepped up in the Madrid derby was Rodrygo. The Brazilian winger has been linked with a move away from the club since Alonso took over, but with a trophy on the line, it was Rodrygo who got the eventual winning goal.He's made the most of limited minutes, and there's still a major role for him to play in the Real Madrid XI, especially in a rivalry match of this magnitude. He only has three goals and six assists in all competitions this season, but cups have been when Rodrygo has shined, scoring twice and assisting two more goals in only six appearances between the Supercopa de España, Copa Del Rey, and Champions League play.Joan Garcia to win the battle of the keepers?Barcelona keeper Joan Garcia crossed rivalry lines, joining from Espanyol to be the number one between the sticks at Barca this past summer. After defeating Athletic Club, he's now kept clean sheets in four consecutive matches and has been able to steady their high-wire attack. Barcelona's high line will leave a keeper isolated, and Garcia's reflexes help make Flick's high line work. But in this final, he'll duel with Thibaut Courtois. The Real Madrid keeper may be 33 now, but he still hasn't lost a step in top-class shootouts. The Belgian has ensured for years that even when Real Madrid's defense bends that it doesn't break, and with Barcelona looking to enter their next era of great keepers with Marc-Andre ter Stegen not being able to stay on the pitch consistently due to injuries, Garcia will need to outduel his counterpart.\nCan anyone stop Raphinha?Real Madrid were lucky not to be overrun by Atletico Madrid, and allowing similar chances to Barcelona would see them lose this match. Facing Athletic Club, Barcelona were able to open a four-goal lead by halftime while Raphinha netted a brace. Flick was able to rotate the squad with Lamine Yamal and Dani Olmo coming off the bench, while Robert Lewandowski was an unused sub. Facing Real Madrid, they'll fully be involved, and it's something that could cause nightmares for what's left of Alonso's defense. Due to injuries, Antonio Rüdiger had to start in the semifinals, which is something that Barcelona will look to take advantage of. Federico Valverde also had to play out of position at right back. He has the work rate for the position, but these are areas that Barcelona will target and could be pivotal to who will come out on top.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first weekend of the NFL playoffs isn't even over, and this year is already turning into one of the most dramatic postseasons in league history. Basically, Wild Card Weekend has lived up to its name so far, because things have gotten wild.The Bills, Bears and Rams all won their opening playoff games by scoring a touchdown in the final three minutes, marking the first time in NFL history that three different playoff games have ended with a game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes. There had been four instances (1982, 2002, 2011 and 2023) in which two playoff games in the same postseason ended with a game-winning touchdown in the final two minutes, but it had never happened three times.Matthew Stafford started the series of suspenseful finishes on Saturday when he hit Colby Parkinson from 19 yards out for a game-winning touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play to give the Rams a 34-31 win over the Panthers.\nThe drama continued Saturday night when the Bears overcame an 18-point halftime deficit to beat the Packers, 31-27. Caleb Williams threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left for the game-winning score.\nWith their touchdowns, the Rams and Bears tied the record for the most game-winning touchdowns in the final two minutes in one postseason, and then Josh Allen set the record when he scored on a 1-yard run with 1:04 left to give Buffalo a 27-24 win over Jacksonville.\nThe Bills-Jaguars game featured four go-ahead touchdowns in the fourth quarter, matching the total from the Rams-Panthers game. In NFL history, there have been only four games with four go-ahead touchdowns in the fourth quarter, and two of them have come this year. \nThe 49ers also pulled off a dramatic win and although they didn't get a game-winning touchdown pass in the final two minutes, they did get one with 2:54 left to play when Brock Purdy hit Christian McCaffrey for a 4-yard score. Through four games, there have been 12 fourth-quarter lead changes, which is the most for any postseason in NFL history. Again, that isn't just a record for the wild card round -- it's the NFL record for an entire postseason and we're not even all the way through Wild Card Weekend. It's been a postseason unlike any other.The wild card round can sometimes lack drama. Just last year, five of the six games were decided by 12 points or more. However, the 2025 season has delivered one of the most dramatic opening rounds in recent NFL history. This marks the first time since 2013 that three wild card games have been decided by four points or less. Coincidentally, the two top seeds that year were the Seahawks and Broncos, who also happen to be the top seeds this year.\nThe NFL was unpredictable this year, and that unpredictability has led to one of the most exciting wild card rounds in league history.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        If Sunday's Serie A clash between Inter and Napoli was meant to clarify who the frontrunner for the title is, it did the opposite. In fact, the eventful game that took place at San Siro showed us all the best skills of both sides, but also their issues. Inter weren't able to keep their advantage twice during the game, after scoring the opening goal of the night with Federico Dimarco before Scott McTominay's equalizer, and then again in the second half when the Scottish midfielder scored his second goal of the game after the penalty of Hakan Calhanoglu. It turned out to be a weekend that didn't change much for the title race as Cristian Chivu's team kept the three point advantage on AC Milan, which drew 1-1 at Fiorentina earlier on Sunday, and the four-point gap on Antonio Conte's side. We can now expect all three to compete until the very end of the season, and don't forget about AS Roma, just four points off the top. \nThe match between Inter and Napoli highlighted the Nerazzurri's struggles against Conte's side. Manuel Akanji was unable to contain Rasmus Højlund, and Inter's defense was particularly culpable for Napoli's second goal, when Akanji, Luis Henrique and Yann Bisseck all stood still and failed to react. Failing to protect their lead on two occasions was not what Chivu wanted, and the series of individual mistakes suggested Inter were maybe too nervous to see out such a crucial match, especially given their struggles against top opponents.There is no match between Inter and Napoli without Conte involved, as he received a red card in the second half after the penalty awarded to the home team. Conte was furious with the decision of the VAR to call the referee for a penalty, but his reaction showed again that this game will never be one like others for the former Inter manager. \nNapoli were able to play one of their best games of the season despite the injuries that are deeply affecting the roster, lastly the one of David Neres who couldn't travel to Milan on Sunday while Inter confirmed again their issues this season against the big teams, as they failed to win against Napoli both times (one draw, one defeat) and lost to AC Milan and Juventus in the first part of the season. AC Milan, meanwhile, drew twice over the past week but remain close to the top of the table and could benefit from the return of the Champions League next week, as both Inter and Napoli will play the final two matches of the league phase later this month. It's predictable that the two teams will lose some points in the coming weeks, and this is why their little margin can become a big factor in the near future. \n            \n    ",

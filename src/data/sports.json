That's lots of firepower on the defensive end for the Thunder, which is why the model projects them to allow nearly 5 more points than their regular season average. With that, the Over hits 51.8% of the time.It has also generated an against-the-spread pick that hits well over 50% of simulations. You can head to SportsLine to see the model's NBA picks. \nSo who wins Thunder vs. Wolves, and which side of the spread hits well over 50% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Timberwolves vs. Thunder spread to back, all from the model that has returned well over $10,000 on top-rated NBA picks, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nine months after he outpointed Diego Lopes for the vacant featherweight title, Alexander Volkanovski will make the first defense of his second title reign on Saturday in a rematch headlining UFC 325 in Sydney, Australia. The biggest narrative surrounding the rematch, which was booked just months after Lopes rebounded to finish Jean Silva in a thrilling slugfest headlining Noche UFC in September, is whether Lopes (27-7) can improve at all on his performance at UFC 314 when he dropped and twice hurt Volkanovski (27-4) but was unable to put him away in a clear decision loss. Even though Lopes even getting the immediate rematch was somewhat controversial in the eyes of fans considering he leapfrogged top contenders Movsar Evloev (who defeated him in 2023) and Lerone Murphy, the 31-year-old native of Brazil has said all of the right things about what he learned from his loss to Volkanovski. \"When I look back at the first fight, I know that I had big moments but I am grateful because the first fight with Volk taught me a lot of different things [about] my life and my career,\" Lopes told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"I fixed those things and now I am a completely different fighter compared to the first fight. Now, I have the experience [of] fighting five rounds and now I have the experience of being in the main event with the cameras behind me. Nothing is new for me now so I don't have the pressure.\"\nSign up for Paramount+ and watch UFC 325 live on Saturday night for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!Lopes, who moved to Mexico at age 19 to become a jiu-jitsu instructor and where he has now set up shop at the Lobo Gym in Guadalajara, now readily admits the moment was too big for him nine months ago and it forced him to abandon his wrestling, throw away his coaches' gameplan and methodically follow Volkanovski around the cage -- without cutting it off -- in search of a one-punch knockout. \n        \n            \n                UFC 325 predictions, odds, best bets: Alexander Volkanovski, Benoit Saint Denis among top picks to consider\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe simplistic nature of Lopes' attack turned out to be easy pickings for Volkanovski, who picked Lopes apart in the opening round (before surviving a knockdown of his own in Round 2) and was able to turn back the clock by reclaiming the 145-pound title he had lost one year earlier via second-round knockout against Ilia Topuria. It's likely because Lopes made the fight so easy for Volkanovski in their first meeting that the 37-year-old legend isn't expecting a more difficult time in the rematch.\n\"I think there is a lot that I can capitalize on [because] I'm capable of changing things and [utilizing] a new strategy,\" Volkanovski told CBS Sports on Wednesday. \"Whether I want to take him down or fight at short range, I feel like I can make whatever adjustments are needed. But for him -- and this is not a knock on him -- but, what is he capable of? I hear people say that he is going to improve so much but I don't think I saw that in his last fight, to be honest. \"How much is he capable of changing? And, if he tries to, is that going to hold him back from what he does best? If he tries to outstrategize me, I think that just makes it a lot harder for him. And if he does plan on doing that, that's going to completely change halfway through the first round.\" The biggest potential improvement for Lopes should come on the ground. Not only does he have an excellent submission base as the longtime jiu-jitsu coach of former UFC women's flyweight champion Alexa Grasso, he has committed himself to improving upon his wrestling game after all but abandoning it against Volkanovski. \nLopes, who made multiple trips in 2025 to Oklahoma State University to train under the guidance of former U.S. Olympic gold medalist David Taylor, showed improvements on the ground against Silva last fall when he utilized takedowns and top control to dominate his countryman in the opening round by landing heavy damage. \"In the first fight, many people asked me why I didn't try to take [Volkanovski] down,\" Lopes said. \"It's because I just tried to finish him with a big punch and a big connection but I forgot the gameplan. At the weigh in, I told my coach that maybe I would try to take him down but [Volkanovski] was a lot shorter, which makes it difficult. He is also so physically strong, too. But this time, I am more calm and more confident. Now, I want to take him down and use my jiu-jitsu and be more of a mixed martial artist.\"Although Volkanovski praised the danger level of Lopes' high-level submission game and the improvements he showed in taking Silva down, he doesn't expect it to be much of a factor in their second fight. \n\"For me, bring that on,\" Volkanovski said. \"Everyone knows about my takedown defense and wherever he takes it, I think it's going to be a rough night for him. I just have to prevent him from landing that big shot.\" \nIt's that one big shot that Volkanovski does have a lot of respect for. Lopes bloodied the left eye of Volkanovski in Round 2 and later dropped him in the closing seconds with a clubbing overhand right. Lopes also won Round 4 on two of the three judges' scorecards after hurting him with a right uppercut to the left eye that forced a wincing Volkanovski to shoot for a takedown.\"You have to put [Lopes' power] right up there because if you just look at the technique, even when he's landing, it's not even pure technique,\" Volkanovski said. \"It's sort of out of position punches. He even has a weird style sort of punch where mechanically it's not how you would fire a punch. Like, Ilia Topuria has got this perfect technique so you can understand why there is so much power behind it. But [Lopes] doesn't even need technique and it's just sheer power. \n\"I was hurting after that fight, I'll be honest. I had stitches all over me and was banged up. I had stitches inside my mouth and obviously I couldn't see out of my eye during the fourth round. So, I definitely felt the punches after, anyway.\"Volkanovski, who hasn't fought since his victory over Lopes, said that he loves when critics mention his age because that only makes his victories more sweet. Lopes, meanwhile, said that he hopes to bring the same type of chaos to the rematch that he thrived in during his wild second round against Silva, which ended with Lopes knocking him out with a spinning back elbow. For Volkanovski, a victory would give him a sixth featherweight title defense, which would place him one short of Jose Aldo's UFC record for the division and further make the case for \"Alexander the Great,\" who defeated Aldo by decision in 2019, as the greatest 145-pound fighter in history. But for Lopes, the motivation to bring home a world title is entirely different. \n\"I left my house like 11 years ago and I told my mom and my dad, 'Look, I'm leaving. I'm trying to look for the best life for all of us and I promise one day I will be champion of UFC,'\" Lopes said. \"Now, I have like 50 percent of this accomplished in my life. I can [provide] the best life for my mom, my dad and my brothers but I have one more thing and that's [to be] the best. I have this chance now. My goal is to take the belt and take a flight back to my city [of Manaus, Brazil] and to take the belt and say, 'Mom and dad, here. My promise is accomplished.'\"Who wins Volkanovski vs. Lopes, and how exactly does the fight end? Visit SportsLine now to get detailed picks and analysis from the incomparable expert who is up over $21,000 on his UFC picks since May 19, 2018, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two superstars will change their fortunes at the WWE Royal Rumble. On Saturday, one man and one woman will secure world title matches at WrestleMania 42. Every year, the Royal Rumble jump-starts the Road to WrestleMania. Superstars throw each other over the top rope with hopes of winning the Rumble. This year, Cody Rhodes seeks to become only the second superstar to win three Rumbles, a feat achieved only by \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. That's a tall task with a stacked field featuring Roman Reigns, Jacob Fatu and Bron Breakker.Nine former world champions are set for the women's Rumble, including Becky Lynch and Liv Morgan. Rounding out the card is Drew McIntyre's first undisputed WWE title defense against Sami Zayn, plus the potential finale of \"The Phenomenal\" AJ Styles. It's a high-stakes retirement match pitting Styles' career against Gunther's Rumble spot.\n        \n            \n                WWE burning questions for the Road to WrestleMania 42: Who wins the Royal Rumble, Elimination Chamber and more\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what   the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action   goes down in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n2026 WWE Royal Rumble predictionsMen's Royal Rumble match: While WWE pulled a brilliant move last year by having Jey Uso win the Rumble to the surprise of everyone, it feels as though there is a good chance that this year's edition gets the \"expected winner\" treatment. Breakker is very clearly positioned to challenge CM Punk for the world heavyweight championship at WrestleMania. While Oba Femi might be the man who has the standout Rumble performance, Breakker has the backing of The Vision, who has agreed to help Breakker get the win. It's not the most shocking outcome, but it makes plenty of sense to set up a big match for WrestleMania. Pick: Breakker wins -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)Women's Royal Rumble match: Where is Belair? She contributed to the best match of WrestleMania 41 weekend, a women's world title match with Rhea Ripley and Iyo Sky. During the match, she suffered a finger injury that sidelined her for over eight months. In July, Belair told CBS Sports that she was at \"the tail end of this healing process,\" but we still haven't seen her wrestle. She re-entered the women's world title scene on the road to WrestleMania last year. I cross my fingers that she does the same this year as a surprise entrant. Pick: Belair wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse) Undisputed WWE Championship -- Drew McIntyre (c) vs. Sami Zayn: Sometimes, you have to just look at a match and think, \"Hey, why not?\" It's fairly clear that Zayn will eventually have a run with a world title, and this is an easy opportunity to put the title on him for a month or two before taking it off of him ahead of WrestleMania. It probably makes sense to keep the title on McIntyre, but if we aren't going to get surprising Rumble winners, why not a surprising title change? Pick: Zayn wins -- Brookhouse\nMcIntyre and Zayn both deserve solid world title reigns, but the defending champ deserves it slightly more. This version of McIntyre has repeatedly fallen short, or had his reign ended the same night it started. McIntyre must win his first title defense, especially amid his feuds with Rhodes and Fatu. I'm not sure McIntyre enters WrestleMania, let alone leaves it, with the undisputed WWE title, but he should hold it past the Rumble. Pick: McIntyre wins -- Mahjouri  AJ Styles vs. Gunther: Do I want Gunther to win? No. I want Styles, my all-time favorite professional wrestler, to deny a loss that would see him retire. I want him to steal Gunther's Rumble spot and win the 30-man match, 10 years after he debuted at the same event, before he retires in 2026. I want him to headline WrestleMania and further his phenomenal legacy. The story is right there. Sometimes the obvious decision is the right one, but I'm not confident WWE will see it through. Reports about creative shake-ups inspire some hope, but not enough to pick against the modern-day legend killer. Pick: Gunther wins -- Mahjouri  Styles isn't going to lose a retirement match. Sure, they could do a rerun of the referee missing Gunther tapping out only for Gunther to win and then reverse the decision on Raw, but that feels unnecessarily complicated. Rather than jumping through unnecessary hoops, Styles should just get the win and continue along his final year as an active wrestler. Pick: Styles wins -- Brookhouse  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It is not often that five-time major champion Brooks Koepka is nervous, but nerves are what he expressed Tuesday when speaking with the media La Jolla, California, ahead of his return to the PGA Tour. Getting the hard part out of the way, Koepka was able to focus on golf alone Thursday as he signed for an opening 1-over 73 at the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open.\"[I was nervous] just because I care,\" Koepka said. \"I think I've fallen back in love with the game. And honestly, watching my son play a little bit and wanting to be able to see him watch me, or I guess want him to watch me play well and realize how much this game's given me, how fun it is and how cool it is to just be out here.\"Koepka's score positions him 11 strokes behind first-round leader Justin Rose, who blitzed the North Course at Torrey Pines with a stellar 10-under 62. As for those who played on the more difficult South Course, like Koepka, Seamus Power was the low man with a 7-under 65. Power and Koepka will face a less stern test on Friday as the North Course was more than three strokes easier than the South Course in Round 1.Not only did Koepka's return mark his first start on the PGA Tour (not including major championships) since the 2022 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, but Thursday saw him take his first competitive reps since the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in early October 2025. As such, some form of rust was inevitable as he played alongside Max Homa and Ludvig Åberg.\n\"I felt like it was pretty good,\" Koepka said. \"I struck it really well. I didn't hit enough fairways. If I was able to get to the back of the ball, I felt like I hit a good quality shot. Didn't really make any putts besides 18 right there. Yeah, it felt good. It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing. I just need to kind of play my way into it.\"For Koepka, it came off the tee and on the greens as he struggled to consistently position himself in the short grass, carding a single birdie despite giving himself a handful of quality looks. The 35-year-old started with a sweet-looking swing into the par-4 1st, where his approach left him 10 feet for an initial birdie that was not meant to be.Koepka hit his first four greens in regulation as he battled the right off the tee and put a bogey on the scorecard along the coast on the par-4 4th, where he required three putts from just about 50 feet. A missed opportunity came on the accessible par-5 6th as Koepka caught a ride on the par train as he rounded the turn in 1 over.\nHe did well to get through a difficult stretch of the golf course unscathed and arrived at the par-5 13th with a real chance to get back to even. After lashing a fairway wood out of the rough and short of the green, Koepka was on the receiving end of an unfortunate break as his third settled long of the green, leaving him a difficult up-and-down. Unable to save par, Koepka drifted to 2 over.The bogey may have brought another square to Koepka's scorecard, but it was also followed by fluid, compact swings. Koepka split his last two fairways and four greens in regulation. His second into the par-5 finisher sizzled through the green, leaving him another difficult scramble opportunity that he cashed in on to return to 1 over.\nAll in all, Koepka did not appear that far off. He was required to be defensive on most of his birdie putts as he left himself looks from above the hole. The breaks did not necessarily bounce his way, either. As the round progressed, he settled into his own. He remained patient and composed, and the good news is it will only get easier from here on out -- both because his play will take place on the North Course on Friday and because the noise surrounding his return should only get quieter.\n\"[I'm appreciating] everything,\" Koepka said. \"Just the opportunity to be out here. I think that's the main thing. Just being out here and seeing how quickly this has all kind of come together. It's kind of blown my mind, and I'm just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys.\"Rose rises to the occasion on the North CourseThe ageless wonder! Rose ripped off 10 birdies late on Thursday to shoot up the leaderboard and command the solo first-round lead. The 45-year-old is no stranger to taking it deep early in the Farmers Insurance Open, as he opened his 2019 tournament with a 63. He ended up winning that event and looks keen to do the same just seven starts removed from his last victory at the St. Jude Championship in last summer's FedEx Cup Playoffs.\n            ",

Former Liverpool player and current CBS Sports analyst Jamie Carragher opened up on a situation like that in his own career as a player on Kickin' It on Paramount+.In his final season before retiring, Carragher said that he spoke with incoming Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers over the phone, and the possibility of Carragher taking up a role as a player manager during the 2012-13 season came up. As Carragher recounts, it could've changed his entire career. \"We had a chat on the phone. We were on the phone for about an hour and a half, two hours just talking football and ideas and at the end of that conversation he offered me a coaching job as in a player coach because I said to him on the phone, 'You're a young manager, I'm an experienced player and I don't want you thinking that I'm going to put pressure on you like that like I'm going to be a problem for you if I'm not playing. I shouldn't be playing for Liverpool right now.'\"At that point, Carragher would've had a chance to see how he felt about coaching by testing the waters, but it didn't come to be. Rodgers never followed up on that discussion, and Carragher didn't ask him about it either, but he did acknowledge that it could've taken him on the management route instead of the current broadcast path.\nJust three or four months after that, he joined Sky Sports as a pundit, and the rest is history. But taking into account how he has seen management impact people in soccer, there is a chance that he wouldn't have enjoyed management in comparison to soccer punditry.\"I saw what the job did to two of the managers who were the biggest influence on me, Rafa Benitez and Gerard Houllier. I looked up to them, I had so much respect for them, they helped me so much,\" Carragher said. \"But the way I like to describe it is the guy who walked in the door on the first day was just a shadow of himself from the guy who walked out six years later.\"The mental toll that managing takes is something that Jurgen Klopp mentioned when leaving Liverpool, and even Argentina's Lionel Scaloni has also talked about why he's considered leaving the job because of it. There's constant pressure to be at your best each day, and it's only natural for it to take a mental toll after a while. Similar struggles face athletes as well, which is one of the reasons that Carragher doesn't miss being on the pitch, saying he is much happier now than when he played. The feeling that he misses the least is losing, but he explained that while he won't get the highs that the sport brings, he also won't experience the lows.\n\"Liverpool is great when things are going well, but a lot of that is joy and relief because you have 4-5 days when you can just relax and look forward to the game next week,\" Carragher said.\"Not every player is like that, and this isn't a criticism of them. I just think my whole life, from being six or seven, football has been in my head constantly every single day. I think I was too hard on myself, and I don't think I enjoyed it enough ... I should've given myself a little bit of slack. If I didn't play well or made a mistake, I'd be in my head for days.\" Carragher did speak about those mental issues with someone, but even when he was at the top of his game, he needed it being in the pressure cooker that is the Premier League. The cost of perfection in these situations made him believe that he couldn't make a mistake and cost the team points. Losing a ball in the air away to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, which led to a draw for the Reds, was a bit of a sliding doors moment for Carragher, as he knew that he shouldn't be putting himself through that. \nHe spoke with someone every few months, and it was important to be able to speak to someone about what he was going through during his career, both the positive and the negative. This is an aspect of soccer that has been talked about more in recent years, but Carragher encourages others not be afraid to talk through things, finding it helpful in his situation.\n\"I needed the help when I was at my best,\" Carragher said. He spoke with someone every few months, and it was important to be able to speak to someone about what he was going through during his career, both the positive and the negative.

Whether due to injury, poor play or just hoping for a change of scenery, these are guys we expect to get better next year.  Three excellent selections from Heath Cummings were Lamar Jackson, Justin Jefferson and Terry McLaurin. And, as you'll hear in the show, Adam Aizer expects three offenses that struggled in 2025 to get better in 2026 with Philadelphia, Tampa Bay and the Chargers. I'll cover my guys here with a bonus in Brock Bowers. As of now, these are all players I plan to target in 2026. BOUNCEBACK CANDIDATES Jayden Daniels In 2024, Daniels was the No. 5 Fantasy quarterback as a rookie at 23.9 points per game. His Average Draft Position in 2025 was the No. 4 quarterback, but he struggled with injuries and was limited to just seven games. He also averaged only 18.6 Fantasy points per game. But he averaged 22.4 Fantasy points in his first five outings, and it's easy to see him getting back to a high level in 2026 if he can stay healthy. He passed for 3,568 yards, 25 touchdowns, and nine interceptions in 2024, along with 891 rushing yards and six touchdowns. His rushing potential is elite, and the Commanders will hopefully add some talent in the passing game, especially since Deebo Samuel and Zach Ertz are pending free agents. I like Daniels as a top-five Fantasy quarterback in 2026.  Justin Herbert Herbert had a solid season in 2025 at 21.8 Fantasy points per game, but I'm hoping he'll get back to the level of production he had in the first two years of his career when he averaged at least 26.3 Fantasy points per game over that span. For starters, getting tackles Rashawn Slater (knee), who missed the entire season, and Joe Alt (ankle), who was limited to six games, back healthy for a full year will be huge. With Alt healthy, Herbert averaged 25.1 Fantasy points per game in 2025. Along with a healthy offensive line, Herbert should benefit with the addition of new offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel, who helped Tua Tagovailoa lead the NFL in passing yards in 2023. This could be a huge season for Herbert in 2026, and he has top-five upside if things go right.  Kenneth Walker III We'll see how Walker finishes the 2025 campaign since he's playing against New England in Super Bowl LX. But things are looking up for Walker in 2026 if he decides to return to Seattle. Zach Charbonnet (ACL) was injured in the Divisional Round of the NFL playoffs against San Francisco, and it's doubtful he'll be ready for the start of next season. Including the game against the 49ers, Walker played nearly three full games without Charbonnet in 2025 and averaged 24.9 Fantasy points over that span. Walker is a free agent this offseason, so we'll see where he plays in 2026, but I'm hopeful he returns to the Seahawks. He could be worth drafting as early as Round 2 in the majority of leagues, depending on how much time Charbonnet might miss next year.  Bucky Irving In the first four games of the 2025 season, when Irving was healthy, he looked like a star when he averaged 18 PPR points per game. He then missed seven games due to injury, and he struggled down the stretch by scoring 10.8 PPR points or less in each of his final four outings. Tampa Bay changed offensive coordinators this offseason, with Zac Robinson taking over, and he was just the play-caller in Atlanta with Bijan Robinson, which is a plus for Irving. Rachaad White is also an unrestricted free agent and isn't expected to return, and Sean Tucker is a restricted free agent. Most likely, Irving will share touches with Tucker, but I still have high hopes for Irving in 2026. Along with what he did to start 2025, he also closed the 2024 campaign by scoring at least 16.3 PPR points in seven of his final nine games. Depending on what happens this offseason, I plan to draft Irving no later than Round 3 in the majority of leagues.  Breece Hall I thought Hall would struggle in 2025, and he averaged a career-low 13.1 PPR points per game. He had respectable stats with 243 carries for 1,065 yards and four touchdowns and 36 catches for 350 yards and a touchdown on 48 targets, but we know he's capable of more. He averaged at least 15.1 PPR points per game in the first three seasons of his career, and I can see him getting back to that level of production -- or better -- in 2026. He's a free agent this offseason, but Jets general manager Darren Mougey has already said the team would like to retain Hall, whether that's on a new deal or the franchise tag. Ideally, he would leave the Jets and join a better offense, especially with an established quarterback, and then we can see just how good Hall really is in a better environment. But if he remains with the Jets, he can still be a standout Fantasy option, and hopefully the team keeps building on offense for 2026. I'm willing to draft Hall as early as Round 3 in the majority of leagues.  CeeDee Lamb Lamb had the worst Fantasy season of his career since his rookie campaign when he averaged just 14.4 PPR points per game in 2025. In 14 games, he had 75 catches for 1,077 yards and three touchdowns on 117 targets. Lamb was overshadowed by George Pickens, who led Dallas with 93 catches for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns on 137 targets, and he averaged 17.2 PPR points per game. The easiest path for Lamb to rebound is if Pickens leaves the Cowboys since he's a free agent, and then Lamb would be a top-three Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues. But I still value Lamb as a top-five Fantasy receiver even if Pickens returns. Dak Prescott still favors Lamb, who averaged at least 17.7 PPR points per game in each of the two previous seasons prior to 2025. That's the level of production I'm expecting for Lamb, and he should be a first-round pick in all formats in 2026.  A.J. Brown Brown had a down season in 2025 when he averaged just 15.1 PPR points per game, which was his lowest total since joining the Eagles in 2022. But it wasn't as bad as you might think. From Weeks 12-17, which includes the Fantasy playoffs, Brown averaged 19.8 PPR points per game, which is standout production. He had four games with at least 10 targets over that span, and he was back to being the alpha of the passing game. The Eagles just hired Sean Mannion to be their new offensive coordinator, and hopefully that will make Brown happy. We don't know if Philadelphia plans to trade Brown, although that seems unlikely given his contract. I'm still planning to draft Brown as a borderline No. 1 Fantasy receiver in the majority of leagues if he stays with the Eagles, and I'll target him as early as Round 3.\nLadd McConkey McConkey, along with Herbert, should benefit with the addition of McDaniel as the offensive coordinator, especially if Keenan Allen leaves as a free agent. McConkey just had a terrible season in 2025 at 11.7 PPR points per game, which was a huge drop-off from his 2024 production when he averaged 15.1 PPR points. But in 2025, McConkey had 11 games with at least six targets, and he averaged 14.2 PPR points per game over that span. McConkey should be the No. 1 receiver for McDaniel, who helped Tyreek Hill have consecutive seasons with at least 119 catches, 1,710 yards, seven touchdowns and 170 targets in Miami in 2022-23. McConkey won't do that, and he'll compete for targets with Quentin Johnston, Tre Harris and Oronde Gadsden II even if Allen is gone. But I'm excited for McConkey entering his third season in the NFL, and I would draft him as early as Round 3.  Brock Bowers Bowers was the No. 2 PPR tight end last season at 14.7 points per game, but he was far behind Trey McBride, who averaged 18.6. Bowers missed five games due to a knee injury, but he played hurt for three games after initially getting injured in Week 1. He missed three games after that and returned in Week 9 against Jacksonville and scored 43.3 PPR points. He has the potential to produce like McBride, if not better, but we still have questions for Bowers in 2026. We know he'll have a new quarterback (likely Indiana's Fernando Mendoza with the No. 1 overall pick) and a new head coach, and both of those guys should feature Bowers in 2026. I'm excited to see what happens in Las Vegas this offseason, and Bowers is worth drafting toward the end of Round 2 or beginning of Round 3 in all leagues.  Sam LaPorta LaPorta missed the final eight games of the season in 2025 with a back injury, but he's expected to be fine for the start of 2026. And I like the addition of new offensive coordinator Drew Petzing for LaPorta. Petzing was on Cleveland's offensive staff from 2020-22 (tight ends coach and quarterbacks coach), and the Browns tight ends had a target share of at least 26.2 percent over that span, with Austin Hooper twice being second on the team in targets. Then, Petzing went to Arizona as the offensive coordinator from 2023-25, and McBride led the Cardinals in targets for three years in a row. Arizona tight ends also had a target share of at least 32.4 percent in all three seasons. LaPorta averaged 14.1 PPR points per game as a rookie in 2023 and scored at least 13.3 PPR points in six of his final seven outings in 2024. He only averaged 11.9 PPR points per game in 2025 before getting hurt, but I plan to draft him as a top-seven Fantasy tight end with a mid-round pick in all leagues in 2026.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        We're  one week out from the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. Who will get moved, and where, is very much top of mind around the league right now. For all the understandable lusting over Giannis Antetokounmpo now that the Bucks are reportedly listening to offers for their superstar, there are several other potential trade candidates who can be considered less valuable and far riskier. Sometimes not acquiring a certain player ends up being the wiser move.What follows is a group we'll call The Avoidables -- five players it would be smarter to steer clear of for various reasons. Buyer beware. 1. Anthony Davis, MavericksInitial reports had Davis undergoing hand surgery that would have shut him down for the remainder of the season. That was eventually walked back after Davis pushed back and voiced his displeasure on social media. Instead, after the Mavericks star consulted with a second specialist, it was announced that the big man would be reevaluated after six weeks. It was another brutal setback to add to AD's long list of health concerns over the years. The man has suffered an outrageous number of injuries in his career, so many that his nicknames include \"Street Clothes\" and \"Anthony Day-to-Day Davis.\" \nTough but fair. He's played just 20 games this season. Last year he played 51 games combined between his time with the Lakers and Mavs. The NBA's new(ish) criteria requires players to appear in at least 65 games in order to be eligible for awards. Davis has cleared that bar just three times in the last decade. No one doubts his talent. Just two seasons ago he made second-team All-NBA and first-team All-Defense. But that kind of output and availability has become the exception rather than the rule. Davis will also turn 33 in March and has two more years left on his current deal. He'll make $58.4 million next season, and he has a player option on the back end for a whopping $62.7 million when he'll be 35 years old before the contract finally expires. If he doesn't play again this season, Davis will have cleared $2.7 million per game. That's good work if you can get it -- but who would want to cut those checks moving forward?\n2. Ja Morant, GrizzliesThe Grizzlies finally arrived at the correct conclusion and are shopping Morant. What I suspect they have learned since putting him on the market is the cruel reality of supply-side economics when there's little demand. The Hawks traded Trae Young to the Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum's expiring contract and Corey Kispert. That kind of low-yield return should have greatly worried the Grizzlies front office. The NBA is loaded with high-usage ball-dominant guards. There just aren't a lot of teams that have a big hole in that area that needs filling. Even if a team wanted to upgrade at that position, it's difficult to make the case for Morant being the guy. The Raptors were reportedly interested in Morant early on but have since cooled on the idea. Hard to blame them. Like Davis, Morant has only been intermittently available. Morant suffered a UCL sprain and is expected to miss at least three weeks. He's played just 20 games this season. The last two seasons he played a combined 59 games. In seven NBA seasons, he's never played more than 67 games. \nJust as concerning, he hasn't progressed on the floor. If anything, he's regressed. For much of his career Morant has relied on his outsized athleticism. He's produced some breathtaking highlights. But those only get you so far. He's a good passer, but in a league that greatly values shooting, Morant has never added an outside element to his skillset. He's a career 31.1% 3-point shooter, and his 44.4 eFG% this season is by far the worst mark in his seven years in the league. Morant has two more years left on his contract for more than $87 million. He'll be 28 in the final year of the deal. That's a lot of money to commit to someone who doesn't shoot well and won't be able to rely on athleticism alone forever. 3. Zion Williamson, PelicansTo be clear, the Pelicans have signaled that they aren't looking to move Williamson. That's been the consistent line of thinking for multiple front offices in New Orleans, though it's fair to wonder why. Considering who precedes him on this list, it's kind of remarkable that Williamson might be the least reliable guy of the bunch. Yes he's played 33 games this season, which is three more than he played all of last year, but we'll see how many more he can add on. In seven years in the NBA, Zion has had three seasons where he played 30 or fewer games. And in the 2021-22 season, he didn't play at all due to injury. \nWilliamson has slimmed down, but he's still a big body that relies on strength and athleticism to make an impact. For someone who's so physical, he's a sneaky good passer (though his assist numbers this season are the lowest they've been since his second year in the league). But much like Morant, his game hasn't evolved during his time in the NBA. He's a 31.7 percent shooter from beyond the arc, on a total of 101 attempts for his entire career. That's not an element that he's worked on or even seems interested in adding. Almost as concerning, he gets to the line a ton. He's averaging just under eight attempts per game this season, but he's shooting 70 percent. That's not great and borders on a liability. Zion has two more years left on his contract and is owed more than $87 million. Eventually, the Pelicans should try to find someone to take Zion off their hands. In the meantime, nice of the New Orleans front office to save the rest of the league from making a mistake. 4. LaMelo Ball, HornetsAt some point the suddenly surging Hornets are going to look around and realize that they have two quality young players to build around and Ball isn't one of them. The future belongs to Kon Knueppel and Brandon Miller. Which doesn't mean that anyone should be rushing out to pry LaMelo away from Charlotte. \nLike everyone else listed so far, Ball has availability issues. He's played 38 games this season. But in four of his other five professional seasons he played 51 or fewer. He's averaging19 points on close to 16.5 shots, his worst production since his rookie year. He's also playing just over 27 minutes per game, the least he's played in his career. And check out what Hornets head coach Charles Lee said about him after a recent loss to the Cavs: \"For the most part, he continued to try to play through it and not let his shot-making, or shot-missing, dictate the energy he was gonna give to the game.\" Talk about damning with faint praise. 5. Zach LaVine, KingsYou could make a case to avoid so many of the potential Kings trade candidates, but LaVine is probably first among them. He's having his worst season in a while. LaVine has always been a volume scorer, but he's averaging fewer than 20 points and shooting under 50% -- a marked drop off from last season. \nSure it's a wonky fit in Sacramento due to poor roster construction, but his usage rate is roughly the same this season as it was when the Kings traded for him last year. When he's not launching and scoring in bunches, he's hardly contributing. His rebounds and assists per game are the lowest they've been since his second season in the NBA when he was 20 years old, and on the defensive end he's far from useful. LaVine will be 31 in March. Like the rest of The Avoidables, he has a dodgy injury history. He played 74 games last season, but just 25 the season before. In six of his first 11 seasons, he played fewer than 65 games. And that contract that made it so tough for the Bulls to find a taker for him until the Kings came along and bailed them out last season still has one more year left. LaVine has a player option for next season at nearly $49 million. Hard to imagine many teams knocking down the Kings door for the chance to pay him that much. \n            ",

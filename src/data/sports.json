The team initially listed him as questionable to return, but he has since been ruled out and is expected to receive full medical testing tomorrow, David Adelman said after the game.Jokić fell to the ground after making accidental contact with teammate Spencer Jones, who was guarding Jaime Jaquez Jr. Jokić immediately fell while grabbing his left knee after making contact with Jones. He was quickly surrounded by members of the team's training staff. \n\"Immediately, he knew something was wrong,\" Adelman told reporters.Jokić, 30, is in the midst of another MVP-caliber season. A three-time league MVP and the 2023 NBA Finals MVP, Jokić is averaging 29.9 points and is leading the league in both rebounds (12.4) and assists (11.1) per game for the Nuggets, who are off to a 22-9 start. \nBad luck would be better than the luck the Nuggets have had this year from an injury standpoint. Aaron Gordon is currently out with a hamstring injury, Cameron Johnson is expected to miss 4 to 6 weeks after injuring his knee earlier this month, and Christian Braun is out indefinitely after suffering a significant ankle sprain last month. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nThe final 'Monday Night Football' game of the 2025 NFL regular season will take place in Week 17 as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Atlanta Falcons. The Rams (11-4) are coming off a Thursday defeat to Seattle, 38-37 in overtime, but L.A. has already clinched a playoff berth. The Falcons (6-9) have been knocked out of postseason contention but enter off back-to-back victories, last defeating Arizona, 26-19. Drake London (knee) is questionable for Atlanta, while Davante Adams (hamstring) is doubtful for LA. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. After opening at -8, the latest Falcons vs. Rams from DraftKings Sportsbook have Los Angeles as the 7-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 48.5, down a point from the opening line. L.A. is at -365 on the money line (risk $365 to win $100). Before making any Rams vs. Falcons     picks, be sure to see the NFL predictions from SportsLine's projection model.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

The Rams lead the league in scoring offense, with the No. 6 scoring defense to boot, making them one of two teams to rank in the top six in both. Matthew Stafford is the MVP frontrunner as he has both the highest touchdown percentage and the lowest interception rate. He's complemented by the No. 5 rushing attack, and the ground game should find success versus an Atlanta run defense which ranks 25th in both yards allowed and yards per rush given up. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Falcons can coverThe Falcons are coming off back-to-back road victories, and they now return home, where they've won four of their last five meetings with the Rams. Kirk Cousins has brought stability to the offense and is 5-1 over his last six 'MNF' starts, while Bijan Robinson is making a run for the Offensive Player of the Year award. He leads the league with 2,026 scrimmage yards, and he's averaging nearly 100 rushing, plus over 50 receiving, yards over his last six games. Additionally, the Rams defense has been leaky as of late as the two highest point totals it has allowed all season have come in the last two weeks. Finally, L.A. is just 4-7 ATS over its last 11 with a rest edge, as it enters in off a Thursday game. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Falcons vs. Rams            picksFor Rams vs. Falcons   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        Matthew Stafford and Bijan Robinson both made history during Monday night's game between the Rams and Falcons.Stafford passed former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for sixth on the NFL's career passing list. Robinson broke 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey's NFL record for the most yards from scrimmage before turning 24 years old. Robinson, who entered Monday night's game needing 68 yards to surpass McCaffrey, set the record on a 93-yard touchdown run that gave the Falcons a 21-0 halftime lead. \nThe milestone cemented Robinson as one of the elite young offensive players in league history, while Stafford's climb up the passing list underscored his longevity and late-career resurgence. Stafford entered the game with 63,988 career passing yards, while Roethlisberger finished his 18-year career with 64,088 yards and two Super Bowl titles.\nNFL career passing leaders PlayerYards1.Tom Brady89,2142.Drew Brees80,3583.Peyton Manning**71,9404.Brett Favre**71,8385.Aaron Rodgers65,9806.Matthew Stafford64,089+7.Ben Roethlisberger64,0888.Philip Rivers63,9849.Matt Ryan 62,79210.Dan Marino**61,361** -- Pro Football Hall of Famers Roethlisberger, who retired after the 2021 season, will be eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for the first time in 2027. Stafford's success this season has undoubtedly increased his odds of being inducted at some point down the road.\nAt 37, Stafford is enjoying arguably his finest season to date. He entered Monday night's game with a league-high 40 touchdown passes against just five interceptions. His 4,179 yards through 15 games is his highest single-season total since 2021, when he led the Rams to the franchise's first Super Bowl title as a Los Angeles-based team.Stafford's success has made him one of the leading candidates for league MVP along with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.\"I know we feel really fortunate to have him in command and running the show,\" Rams coach Sean McVay recently said of Stafford. \"And his competitiveness, his enjoyment for those moments, his ability to be at his best when his best is required, his ability to elevate his teammates and his overall ownership of what we're trying to get done with the intent, whether that be run or pass game or protection-oriented.\"He's a total 'G,' and he's been 'G.' I think it's just getting more recognized now, but this isn't new to us.\"LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Rams battle the Falcons on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nRobinson, who was just named to his second straight Pro Bowl, has emerged as one of the NFL's best and most versatile running backs. He eclipsed 2,000 all-purpose yards in just 15 games while averaging 135.1 total yards per game.While his favorite running back was LaDainian Tomlinson (a TCU alum), Robinson takes great pride in continuing the tradition of accomplished NFL running backs that came out of Texas -- a list of backs that includes Hall of Famer Earl Campbell, fellow former Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams and former Chiefs All-Pro Jamaal Charles. Robinson said those players have helped inspire him in more ways than one.\"It's a blessing, man,\" he told CBS Sports earlier this year. \"Those guys have set up the success of the running back at Texas. So for me to follow it and continue to push it in the NFL, it's been really cool. Getting to talk to them and being around them and letting them be my big brothers and give me advice while I'm on the field.\"I want the guys behind me to do the same thing. I just continue to try to preach goodness into them. And it's pretty special that my whole running back room is in the NFL. It's a blessing to see all those guys continue to keep playing in this league.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Assists were the theme of Week 17 in the NFL. Various outcomes throughout the slate had ramifications that stretched beyond the two teams going toe to toe and have begun reshaping the playoff picture in both conferences.On Christmas Day, the Vikings punched the Packers' ticket to the playoffs after defeating the Lions. On Saturday, the Texans not only clinched a playoff berth, but handed the AFC West title to the Broncos after defeating the Chargers. As we continued through Sunday's action, even more assists were dished out, most notably with the Seahawks and Browns pulling off wins against the Panthers and Steelers, respectively.Because of those outcomes (along with Miami defeating Tampa Bay), we could have two win-or-go-home division title matchups in Week 18: Ravens at Steelers for the AFC North and Panthers at Buccaneers for the NFC South. However, this NFC South matchup could have a wrench thrown into it depending on how the Falcons end their season. While out of the playoff race, if Atlanta wins out (vs. the Rams on Monday night and Saints), Carolina will win the division, regardless of the outcome of that matchup with the Bucs. That's due to the Panthers winning a tiebreaker because of a better head-to-head record among the three teams. In the late window on Sunday, the Eagles lent a helping hand to the Patriots, securing the AFC East crown for New England after Philly took down the Bills in Buffalo. \nAs for Sunday's prime-time slugfest between the 49ers and Bears, San Francisco's victory now sets up a Week 18 showdown between them and the Seahawks for the No. 1 seed and NFC West title. And to finish up Week 17, the Falcons jumped out to a 21-0 lead over the Rams and held on for the 27-24 victory on \"Monday Night Football.\"As we wrap up the bulk of Sunday's action, here's a look at the current playoff picture. \nAFC standingsz-Denver Broncos (13-3)z-New England Patriots (13-3)x-Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)x-Houston Texans (11-5)x-Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)x-Buffalo Bills (11-5)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. ChargersDenver got back to its winning ways with a key victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night. With the win, the Broncos remain the No. 1 seed in the conference and are now the AFC West division winners after the Texans beat the Chargers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (13-3)Remaining schedule: vs. DolphinsThe Patriots had already clinched a playoff berth in Week 16, and are now AFC East champions thanks to the events of Week 17. They did their part earlier on Sunday by blowing out the Jets, and then the Eagles fended off the Bills to lock up the division. New England is also still alive for the No. 1 seed. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Remaining schedule: vs. TitansThe Jaguars fended off the Colts in Week 17 and can clinch the AFC South next week with a win over the Titans.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)Remaining schedule: vs. RavensAfter falling to the Browns in Week 17, the Steelers face a do-or-die matchup with the Ravens in Week 18. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Houston Texans (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have won eight straight games to punch their ticket to the playoffs. Houston extended that winning streak with a victory over the Chargers on the road and remains alive in the AFC South race. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)Remaining schedule: at BroncosThe Chargers had their four-game winning streak snapped with a Saturday afternoon loss against the Texans. They are likely to rest players in Week 18 and prepare for a road opener. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. JetsThe Bills' defeat at the hands of the Eagles in Week 17 officially eliminated them from winning the AFC East and has dropped them to the No. 7 seed. The Bills have already clinched a playoff berth, so it'll be interesting to see if they opt for rest over seed positioning in Week 18. In the huntThe Ravens (8-8), with Lamar Jackson sidelined, kept their playoff hopes alive with an impressive road win against the Packers in Green Bay. Then, on Sunday, they had their prayers answered with the Browns upsetting Pittsburgh. That sets up a winner-take-all matchup in the AFC North against the Steelers in Week 18. The loser will be eliminated from playoff contention. NFC standingsx-Seattle Seahawks (13-3)z-Chicago Bears (11-5)z-Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Carolina Panthers (8-8)x-San Francisco 49ers (12-4)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-5)x-Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (13-3)Remaining schedule: at 49ersSeattle pulled off an incredible, come-from-behind win over the Rams on \"Thursday Night Football,\" elevating itself to the No. 1 seed in the conference in the process. They continued to hold that top spot in the conference after taking down the Panthers in Week 17. So long as they take down the 49ers in Week 18, they'll win the NFC West and be the No. 1 seed. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. LionsThe Bears nearly pulled off yet another comeback against the 49ers, but came up just short. Even with the loss in Week 17, Chicago currently sits as the No. 2 seed in the conference thanks to the head-to-head tiebreaker they own over Philly. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Remaining schedule: vs. CommandersPhiladelphia punched its playoff ticket in Week 16 with a commanding victory over the Commanders. The defending Super Bowl champions became the first team to win back-to-back NFC East crowns since 2004. After outlasting the Bills in Week 17, the Eagles are merely fighting for seeding in the regular-season finale\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Carolina Panthers (8-8)Remaining schedule: at BuccaneersDespite losing to the Seahawks, Carolina still has two paths to winning the NFC South entering Week 18.\nThe first is simple: Beat the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay on Saturday night.Even if that doesn't happen, the Panthers can still clinch the division if the Falcons defeat the Saints on Sunday. That outcome would create a three-way tie atop the NFC South at 8-9, a scenario in which Carolina would hold the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. San Francisco 49ers (12-4)Remaining schedule: vs. SeahawksThe 49ers have a playoff berth already clinched, and after staving off the Bears in Week 17, are heading into a Week 18 matchup against the Seahawks that'll determine the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the NFC. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Los Angeles Rams (11-5)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are in the playoffs, but cannot climb to the No. 1 seed or win the NFC West. They'll be a wild card entry. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)Remaining schedule: at VikingsGreen Bay, minus Jordan Love, fell to Derrick Henry and the Ravens on Saturday night. The loss ended any hopes of winning the NFC North title and locked Green Bay into the NFC's No. 7 seed.In the huntThe Buccaneers (7-9) have experienced a dramatic fall from grace in this second half of the season. Even after losing to the Dolphins in Week 17, however, they still have an opportunity to jump up to the No. 4 seed as the NFC South champion. To do that, the Bucs need to win their Week 18 contest against the Panthers and have the Falcons lose to the Saints. \n            ",

The veteran has started six games and gone under his passing yards prop in four of those. This is Cousins' 11th season with at least six starts under his belt, and it's arguably his worst season with that amount of playing time. His passer rating, completion percentage, yards per attempt and touchdown percentage are all the lowest of those 11 seasons.The Rams also won't make it easy for Cousins to rack up yardage through the air as they have a ferocious pass rush which has the fourth-most pressures in the NFL. Just seven teams have allowed a lower passer rating than L.A., and after the Rams gave up a season-high of 6.8 yards per carry in their last game versus Seattle, the ground game should be Atlanta's preferred option. Cousins is projected to have 180.4 yards carries on average, as this NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here.Bet Cousins to go Under 225.5 passing yards at DraftKings:\nHow to make Falcons vs. Rams SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has nine other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better that could be a part of your Rams vs. Falcons SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Falcons vs. Rams predictions?

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Browns defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers removed some of the drama with regard to the 2026 NFL Draft. As long as the Browns won, the Las Vegas Raiders and New York Giants were still going to be in a position to pick Nos. 1 and 2 regardless of Sunday's result. By way of a 34-10 defeat, Las Vegas is now in position to pick first and has a need at the quarterback position. Although Indiana's Fernando Mendoza and Oregon's Dante Moore are regarded as the top two quarterback prospects, neither has declared yet.Cleveland, meanwhile, falls to No. 6 overall and may have taken itself out of the running for a franchise quarterback despite Shedeur Sanders doing nothing to state his case for the role long term. As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. \nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon), as well as potential team needs:1. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTLas Vegas' decision to shut down edge rusher Maxx Crosby sent a signal to the league that it was not trying to win anymore this season, so it was no surprise the team could not get up off the mat for Sunday's game against the Giants. 2. New York Giants (3-13)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTNew York lost the rights to the No. 1 overall selection. It was presumably not going to pick a quarterback, but it could cost it the opportunity to sell the pick to the highest bidder. \n3. New York Jets (3-13)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEThe Jets were on the wrong end of the biggest blowout of the day. The Patriots made a statement as they close in on the AFC East title and fight for the conference's No. 1 seed.   4. Tennessee Titans (3-13)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGETennessee was in position to win, but Tyler Shough outclassed fellow rookie quarterback Cam Ward in the fourth quarter on Sunday. 5. Arizona Cardinals (3-13)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBArizona was never a threat to knock off Cincinnati on Sunday. The good news is that the season comes to a merciful end next week for the Cardinals.\n6. Cleveland Browns (4-12)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLCleveland may be responsible for keeping Pittsburgh out of the postseason, but it also may have cost itself an opportunity to draft a franchise quarterback by dropping back in the draft order. 7. Washington Commanders (4-12)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington turned to Josh Johnson on Christmas Day with Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota sidelined, and the team fell short against the Cowboys. The Commanders continue to creep up the draft order with one game remaining. 8. New Orleans Saints (6-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans won its fourth consecutive game on Sunday. If the regular season were extended a few more weeks, the Saints may have an opportunity to win the division. \n9. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEKansas City is in a similar situation as Washington -- without its top two quarterbacks. Chris Oladokun threw for 66 yards in a loss to the Broncos on Christmas night.10. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGECincinnati is not contending for the playoffs, but it has maintained winning expectations for the future. Sunday's lopsided win over the Cardinals will potentially strengthen the case to keep coach Zac Taylor for another season. 11. Miami Dolphins (7-9)Projected needs: QB, CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami did its part to contribute to Tampa Bay's misery. Tua Tagovailoa may not be a part of the team's future, but Mike McDaniel is stating his case to hang around. \n12. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (7-9)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLIt turned out to be a lose-lose for the Rams on Monday night. After their upset loss to the Falcons, not only are they in danger of missing out on the No. 5 seed in the NFC, but the Atlanta draft pick they own also got worse.13. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-9)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TETampa Bay has lost seven of its past eight games. It will miss out on the playoffs with a loss to Carolina next week. 14. Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas took care of business against a hapless Commanders team without its top two quarterbacks. A perfect .500 record is on the line next week against the Giants. \n15. Detroit Lions (8-8)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit could not establish the run or pass against Minnesota's defense. In addition to Jared Goff's two interceptions, one of the most explosive run games in the league was limited to 2.3 yards per carry. 16. Baltimore Ravens (8-8)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBBaltimore took care of business against the Packers thanks to the ageless Derrick Henry, but its playoff hopes are only alive because of the Browns' upset win over the Steelers. The Ravens travel to Pittsburgh in Week 18 for a winner-take-all matchup.17. Minnesota Vikings (8-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBMinnesota did a good job stepping into passing lanes against Jared Goff. The veteran threw two interceptions and succumbed to rookie Max Brosmer, who threw for just 51 yards.  \n18. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLThe Colts have faced ample adversity and completed an epic collapse, but the team did not give up on coach Shane Steichen.19. Carolina Panthers (8-8)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLThe NFC South is once again the division with the token playoff representative. The possibility exists that the winner finishes with a record below .500 if Tampa Bay wins in Week 18.20. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLAaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh offense appeared more interested in Myles Garrett not getting the sack record than putting together anything that resembled offense on Sunday. It's now a win-or-go-home situation next week against the Ravens. \n21. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-6-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBMalik Willis continues to acquit himself well ahead of free agency, but the Packers lost the NFC North with their loss to the Ravens on Saturday night.22. Los Angeles Chargers (11-5)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLLos Angeles lost a must-win game against the Texans on Saturday. Houston was able to run out the clock after a Chargers touchdown created a one-score game late in the fourth quarter.23. Buffalo Bills (11-5)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRBuffalo scored 12 unanswered points in the fourth quarter ... to lose by one against Philadelphia.\n24. Los Angeles Rams (11-5)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLThe Rams allowed the Falcons to jump out to a 21-0 lead on \"Monday Night Football,\" and even after they stormed back to tie the game at 24, they gave up the game-winning field goal with under a minute left.25. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLPhiladelphia had less than 200 yards of offense, failed to score in the second half and still beat the Bills.26. Houston Texans (11-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SHouston has won eight consecutive games to keep pace within the AFC South. The Texans have an opportunity to win the division after starting the season 0-3 if the Jaguars falter. 27. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLIndianapolis and Jacksonville went back and forth all afternoon, but an aggressive fourth-down call by coach Liam Coen put the Jaguars in position to win.28. San Francisco 49ers (12-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TEThe 49ers won a wild shootout against Chicago to set the stage for a huge Week 18 NFC West matchup against the Seahawks.29. Chicago Bears (11-5)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTThe comeback Bears couldn't pull off another last-second win and fell to the 49ers on \"Sunday Night Football.\"30. New England Patriots (13-3)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEFive different Patriots caught touchdown passes from Drake Maye on Sunday, including rookie undrafted free agent Efton Chism III. 31. Denver Broncos (13-3)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTDenver is not playing its best ball right now, but it may do enough to earn the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC and a week to reset. 32. Seattle Seahawks (13-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRSeattle maintains its lead in the NFC West with a win over the Panthers. It has won six straight games. The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

The No. 1 overall prospect in the class of 2027, Jacobs committed to the Buckeyes live on CBS Sports HQ over a laundry list of high-level suitors -- including Miami, which was the perceived favorite headed into the announcement. \"Massive shocker,\" said Andrew Ivins, the Director of Scouting for 247Sports. \"Ohio State is putting it all together and I love the fit. Defensive line coach Larry Johnson is perfect for Jacobs given what he's done with kids.\" Jacobs is the ninth player to commit to Ohio State during the 2027 cycle. \nMiami is not the only program wondering what went awry with one of the best defensive line prospects of the modern recruiting era. Jacobs preps at Blessed Trinity Catholic High School in Roswell, Georgia -- and he's a double Georgia legacy. His father, David, played defensive line for the Bulldogs and his mom, Desiree, played basketball at Georgia. Former Georgia coach Mark Richt is DJ's godfather.\"Cast-iron edge defender with the size, speed and strength to wreak havoc on Saturdays and then Sundays.\" 247Sports Director of Scouting Andrew Ivins wrote in his evaluation of Jacobs. \"Projects as a future difference-maker for a College Football Playoff contender that can set the edge and get after the quarterback.\" \nShould Jacobs keep his No. 1 ranking in the 2027 class, he would be the first defensive end prospect to maintain that ranking since the 2019 class. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Andy Reid has no plans of retiring, even after the Kansas City Chiefs' first season missing the playoffs since 2014. Speaking Monday, Reid not only confirmed he plans to return but expressed his optimism for the upcoming NFL Draft.When asked if there was \"any scenario\" in which he wouldn't be the Chiefs' coach, Reid said no.\"I think I'm coming back, right?\" Reid said with a wry smile. \"If they'll have me back (chuckles), I'll come back. You never know in this business, so that's a tough one, but I plan on it, yeah.\"Reid, who will turn 68 in March, is wrapping up his 27th consecutive season as a head coach -- the first 14 of which were with the Philadelphia Eagles, the last 13 with the Chiefs. At 6-10, the Chiefs have clinched not only their worst record under Reid, but their first losing season under him, too.\nIt's been a trying season for Kansas City, one that has included Patrick Mahomes tearing his ACL in Week 15, the same week the team got eliminated from playoff contention. The Chiefs are an NFL-worst 1-8 in one-possession games, and they've suffered several injuries around Mahomes as well.Given his age, Reid has answered retirement questions for the past several seasons. After winning the Super Bowl two seasons ago, Reid said he hadn't thought about retiring, and he said he'd be back for 2025 even before last year's Super Bowl loss. Reid is under contract through 2029 after signing an extension in 2024.This season hasn't gone to plan, though, and there are major questions this offseason, too, questions that may be answered -- at least in part -- by the draft. The Chiefs are currently projected to pick ninth.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL Draft order after Week 17: Raiders land No. 1 pick after loss to Giants; Browns fall out of top 5\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"With [General Manager] Brett [Veach] and his crew doing it, that part's exciting to see and what takes place,\" Reid said. \"Something to look forward to. You're right, it's not where you want to be, but it is where we are, and we've got good people doing the picking headed by Brett.\"Here are the main issues Reid will face going into 2026:Patrick Mahomes' healthThough every player and every injury is different, Mahomes, 30, should be ready to go for the 2026 season opener, according to CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo.\"The average ACL rehab is approximately 6-8 months,\" Jaramillo said on CBS Sports HQ in the immediate aftermath of the injury. \"He will miss OTAs, which come around March. But he'd be actually almost jogging by OTAs. So I have zero concerns short-term. He will have surgery within the next 48 hours. That's the best window to do that. And he will have no long-term concerns.\"\nEven amid a down year for his team, Mahomes had a strong 2025, ranking eighth in expected points added per play, even though he also had a top-10 drop rate and an up-and-down offensive line working against him. He did have a career-low 4.4% touchdown rate, but he made up for that with a career-high five touchdown runs.\n        \n            \n                Chiefs face uncertain future after Patrick Mahomes' ACL tear: What's next for Kansas City's offense\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill Travis Kelce retire?Kelce admitted the Chiefs' Week 17 game against the Denver Broncos was an emotional one, though he owed that fact to the game being on Christmas. But if Kelce retires, it also might have been his final home game.\"Honestly, I've just been focused on trying to win football games, man,\" Kelce said about the possibility of retirement. \"I'll make that decision with my family, friends and the Chiefs organization when the time comes.\"\nWhether or not Kelce returns or retires, his contract is up; he signed a two-year, $34.25 million contract in 2024. Kelce had said that part of his fire to return in 2025 was to avenge last season's Super Bowl loss, but that possibility is no longer in the cards.Kelce is not the game-changing weapon he once was, but he has remained an integral part of the Chiefs' offense. His 73 catches and 839 receiving yards are most on the team, and his five touchdown catches are tied for most. He broke the Chiefs' career touchdown record earlier this season.Chiefs salary cap situation, free agents, needsKansas City's long list of needs became apparent throughout the year. One problem, though, is their salary cap situation, as former NFL agent Joel Corry outlined. Kansas City will need to restructure Mahomes' contract and will likely do the same with Chris Jones'.\nSeveral key players, including Kelce, running backs Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco, linebacker Leo Chenal, cornerback Jaylen Watson and safety Brian Cook, are slated to be free agents, too.Kansas City would love to upgrade its running back situation; it continued to be one of the least explosive rushing attacks in the NFL, even though underlying metrics suggest the offensive line blocked well. The team will also likely look for more pass-rushing help, pass-catching reinforcements -- especially if Kelce departs -- offensive line depth and defensive backs, depending on who is retained.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Clemson has parted ways with offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Garrett Riley, according to on3sports. Riley, the younger brother of USC coach Lincoln Riley, spent the past three years at Clemson. During Riley's time at Clemson, the school ranked 52nd, 18th and 71st in the nation in scoring, respectively. This season, the Tigers endured a disappointing 7-6 season that culminated with a 22-10 loss to Penn State in the Pinstripe Bowl. This past season, the Tigers averaged 27.2 points per game a year after averaging 34.7 points per contest. They were held under their season average eight times that included four straight games to start the season. During their loss to Penn State, the Tigers gained just 236 total yards, recorded just 16 first downs and were held to 43 yards on 25 carries. The 2025 season marked just the second time that the Tigers failed to win at least nine games since 2009, which was Dabo Sweeney's first full season as Clemson's coach. This year marked the program's worst season since 2010. \n\"We've got great people,\" Swinney said following Clemson's loss to Penn State. \"I love all the people on my staff, but you evaluate everything, that's just a part of our business, and it's a part of the end of the season, as you step back, and I don't make emotional decisions.\"Riley, 36, played quarterback under legendary coach Mike Leach at Texas Tech before beginning his coaching career in 2011 at Texas' Roosevelt High School. He then spent one season coaching at the Division III ranks before getting a graduate assistant position at East Carolina. \nJust prior to coming to Clemson, Riley enjoyed a successful, albeit brief tenure at TCU as the school's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. While at TCU, he won the Broyles Award, which recognizes the best assistant coach in college football. \n            ",

The schedule is stacked once again this year as fanbases are afforded the opportunity to see their teams in action one more time before the attention turns to the 2026 season. The bowl schedule kicked off Saturday, Dec. 13 and goes all the way until Jan. 2. The College Football Playoff carries us from there to Jan. 19, when two teams will vie for a national championship in Miami Gardens, Florida. CBS will once again broadcast the Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl. Kick is set for 2 p.m. on Dec. 31 in El Paso, Texas. Additionally, Dec. 27 is one of the most stacked days of the year as eight bowl games will take place on that day, including the Pop-Tarts Bowl, Texas Bowl and Snoop Dogg Arizona Bowl Presented By Gin & Juice By Dre and Snoop (yes, that's its official name). \nBelow is a detailed look at the complete schedule for the 2025-26 college football bowl season, including dates, locations and TV channels.

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Even though the Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1) were eliminated from postseason contention when they took the field on Christmas Day, it was somewhat understandable as to why they would play 32-year-old, four-time Pro Bowl quarterback Dak Prescott.Dallas was running the first leg of three standalone NFL games on a holiday in which most of the country was sitting at home. The Cowboys were also playing on a short week on Thursday, which wouldn't provide many opportunities to get backup Joe Milton ready to roll after playing just 24 offensive snaps this season.However, first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer plans to start Prescott, who suffered a season-ending hamstring injury midway through 2024, in Week 18 against the 3-13 New York Giants. Why? He would like for the Cowboys to finish 8-8-1 and avoid having a losing record. \"Yeah, plan on finishing strong and having Dak play, again get a chance to go 5-1 hopefully in the division, finish 8-8-1 and that's the plan as we're looking at now,\" Schottenheimer said Monday. \nIt's worth Schottenheimer reconsidering since Dallas surrendered a season-high six sacks in a 30-23 win against the Washington Commanders in Week 17 while playing Pro Bowl left guard Tyler Smith out of position at left tackle with Tyler Guyton (ankle) on injured reserve. Undrafted guard T.J. Bass has slid into the starting lineup at left guard with Smith at left tackle. Smith's four quarterback pressures allowed were tied for his third-most in a game in his four-year career, per TruMedia, while Bass' one pressure was tied for the fourth-most in a game in his three-year career. \"I didn't think we did a good enough job protecting Dak last game. It wasn't just those two guys. I thought we ran the ball really, really well. I thought the communication between those guys was really, really good. But I do think that our fundamentals got a little sloppy in a couple of areas,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I'll talk about Tyler for a second. Just to nonchalantly move out to left tackle in this league to me is just crazy. But he does it, and he does it with a smile. He just goes out there and competes. T.J. Bass, he's played so much meaningful football for us, really over the last couple of years. I think he's a very, very talented young player, his star is on the rise. I really like what T.J. does for us.\"Even if Prescott starts, Schottenheimer didn't rule out also rotating in his strong-armed, second-year backup in Milton, someone whose arm talent the coach is \"mesmerized\" by. \n\"We'll look at that. The biggest thing for me is to put the game plan together and hopefully have another great week of practice and focus on getting our prep,\" Schottenheimer said. \"You know how much respect I have for this team, this defense we're getting ready to play, an elite front seven. But yeah, we'll see how the week goes. But right now the plan is to play Dak.\"In his first season, Schottenheimer is aiming to establish a culture where every game is viewed by his players as a \"championship opportunity\" even if that isn't the case like it has been for Dallas since Week 16. In the world the Cowboys live in, Week 18 means something. That's why the current plan is to start Prescott, injury risk be damned. \"I think they all mean something that's what I would say, I think they all do mean something. I think we're all being evaluated on the whole season here,\" Schottenheimer said. \"We're proud of the fact we've played well against the NFC East opponents and get a chance to play another one this weekend but yeah, I feel good about it. ... I am a guy that is all about process. I'm going to be the same guy every day and every week. This week is no different. These guys put a lot of time and energy preparing for 17 games. That's how much we signed up for. We are going to compete to win all 17 and hopefully we can get No. 8 this weekend.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) will be a part of that effort remains up in the air as Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters Monday that the team will have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice.\"It's to be determined,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.\"Jackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said.\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson. \nFurthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.\"A+,\" Harbaugh said after the game. \"A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.\"\nHarbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.\n            ",

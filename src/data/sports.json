    "body": "\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers won five of their first six games of the 2025 NFL season and gave the impression that they would cruise to their fifth consecutive NFL South title and the 11th division crown in franchise history. But they've lost five of their last seven contests and are clinging to first place, with a pair of crucial matchups against the Carolina Panthers remaining on their schedule.Before worrying about those showdowns, Tampa Bay (7-6) must take care of business against another division rival as it opens Week 15 by hosting the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday Night Football at Raymond James Stadium. The Buccaneers dropped a 24-20 decision to the lowly New Orleans Saints at home last week and are tied for first place in the NFC South with the Panthers (7-6), who upset the conference-leading Los Angeles Rams 31-28, but currently own the tiebreaker.While Tampa Bay only lost to New Orleans by four points, three of its previous four defeats were by double digits. Since their bye in Week 9, the Buccaneers' lone win in five games was a 20-17 triumph over the inferior Arizona Cardinals, who have won just once in 11 contests after beginning the season with back-to-back victories.Two weeks after leaving Tampa Bay's 34-7 loss to Los Angeles with a shoulder injury, Baker Mayfield completed only 14 of his 30 pass attempts against New Orleans last Sunday for 122 yards. The 30-year-old quarterback, who was in the league MVP discussion earlier this season, has failed to eclipse the 200-yard mark in five of his last six outings and finished with fewer than two touchdown passes in six of the past seven.Tampa Bay's struggles have opened the door for Carolina, which has gone seven seasons without a playoff appearance and hasn't won the NFC South since a three-year run from 2013-15. The Panthers fell two games behind the Buccaneers after their 40-9 setback against the Buffalo Bills in Week 8 but climbed back into contention for the division title by winning three of their next five contests.Carolina held its own against Los Angeles last Sunday, as the lead changed four times before Bryce Young connected with Tetairoa McMillan for his third touchdown pass of the game with 6:34 remaining in the fourth quarter to put the Panthers ahead for good. The Panthers also won the turnover battle 3-0, with Rams star quarterback Matthew Stafford throwing two interceptions -- including one that was returned for a TD by cornerback Mike Jackson -- and fumbling at the Carolina 30-yard line while being sacked by defensive end Derrick Brown with 2:34 to play.\nWhile Thursday night's matchup against the Falcons is not a must-win for the Buccaneers, it would leave them with in the driver's seat in the NFC South. Tampa Bay visits Carolina in Week 16 and, following a meeting with the Dolphins in Miami, hosts the Panthers in the regular-season finale.Atlanta (4-9) was expected to be in the mix for the division crown this season but has been in a free fall since posting a shocking 24-14 victory against the Buffalo Bills in Week 6. The Falcons lost five consecutive contests after the upset and stopped the bleeding with a 24-10 triumph over the Saints before it resumed with setbacks versus the New York Jets and Seattle Seahawks.Despite its struggles, Atlanta is capable of making things difficult for Mayfield and the Buccaneers. The club is ninth in the NFL against the pass, allowing an average of 191.5 yards through the air per game, and faces a Tampa Bay aerial attack that ranks 27th (237.8 yards). The Falcons also rank third with 43 sacks.James Pearce Jr. is tied with defensive tackle Brandon Dorlus for the team lead with six sacks and has registered at least one in each of his last five games, while fellow linebacker Jalon Walker is right behind them with five. However, Dorlus (groin) and Walker (quadriceps) both are questionable for Thursday's showdown.The Buccaneers are strong against the run, ranking eighth in the league with an average of 100.6 yards allowed on the ground. They'll need to come up with a big effort against Atlanta's Bijan Robinson, who is fourth in the NFL in rushing with 1,081 yards. The 23-year-old running back was an integral part of the Falcons' passing game in their first meeting with Tampa Bay this season as he made six catches for 100 yards and a touchdown. SportsLine's Inside the Lines team feels Tampa Bay still has a great chance to continue its reign in the NFC South. According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, the Bucs currently have a 75% chance to capture the division title, and their chances would increase to nearly 83% with a victory against the Falcons but drop to just over 59% with a loss.The best path to the postseason for both Tampa Bay and Carolina is by winning the NFC South. The model says the prospects for the Panthers as they enter their Week 15 road matchup against the Saints are at 25% and would rise to 35% with a victory in \"The Big Easy,\" but dip below 20% with a defeat.CHANCES OF WINNING NFC SOUTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 15 WINWITH WEEK 15 LOSSDIFFERENCETampa Bay Buccaneers75.0%82.7%59.1%23.6%Carolina Panthers25.0%35.0%15.6%19.4%The likelihood of Tampa Bay and Carolina both winning this week is high, so a victory by the Bucs in their first matchup of the season in Week 16 figures to give them a massive advantage in the race for the division title as they then visit Miami while the Panthers host Seattle. It would behoove Carolina to win the first meeting with Tampa Bay, as if it does, there's a strong chance both clubs will possess 9-7 records when they square off at Raymond James Stadium in the season finale.But first, the Buccaneers need to right the ship and complete a season sweep of the Falcons on Thursday night. The division rivals opened their campaign with a showdown in Atlanta, and wideout Emeka Egbuka made his second touchdown reception of the game with 54 seconds left in the fourth quarter to help Tampa Bay post a 23-20 victory.Falcons receiver Drake London will miss his fourth consecutive game due to a knee injury, but Buccaneers wideout Mike Evans (collarbone) may make his first appearance since Week 7 as he was activated from injured reserve on Wednesday. Tampa Bay is a 4.5-point favorite against Atlanta in the latest consensus odds, and the ITL team's model is projecting a 26-20 victory for the Bucs.\n            ",

Ngannou revealed on Wednesday that his PFL contract will expire in time for next year's White House card, but it would require fences to be mended with Dana White and UFC.Ngannou left the UFC in January 2023, vacating the UFC heavyweight championship and later signing with the PFL. Since then, he's fought once in mixed martial arts, knocking out PFL heavyweight tournament winner Renan Ferreira. \"The Predator\" is expecting a new fight offer from the PFL, with his contract expiring soon.\"I'm getting very close on the PFL contract [ending],\" Ngannou told \"The Ariel Helwani Show\" on Wednesday. \"They have to give me a fight.\" Ngannou said his PFL contract will expire before the UFC's White House card, which is widely expected to take place in June. When asked if Ngannou is interested in pursuing a fight with Jones, Ngannou said, \"Yes, if that could happen.\"  \n\"Confident, no, but there's a chance,\" Ngannou said about the potential of a UFC reunion at the White House. \"Anything can happen.\" The biggest hurdle for Ngannou vs. Jones is the fighters' respective relationships with UFC CEO Dana White. Ngannou and White have bickered back and forth in the media for years after their 2023 negotiations for a new contract fell through. White has also repeatedly thrown cold water on Jones' campaign to fight at the White House, claiming to not trust the all-time great to be reliable. \nNgannou has boxed more than he's fought in MMA since leaving the UFC. He took former unified heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury to a shockingly close split decision in Ngannou's professional boxing debut. His sophomore stint ended far worse, with Anthony Joshua knocking him out in two rounds. Aside from the Jones fight, Ngannou is also interested in fighting Deontay Wilder in some capacity. Wilder recently claimed negotiations for an Ngannou fight were \"warming up.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        As soon as it seemed like the college football coaching carousel was finally slowing down, Michigan announced it had fired Sherrone Moore for cause after an investigation revealed an inappropriate relationship with a staffer. The Wolverines becoming a late entry to the coaching search fray throws a real wrench in this offseason. We saw a ton of coaches sign fresh contract extensions after turning down openings at Penn State, Florida and Auburn, but Michigan may be a different beast. It is one of the best jobs in the country in terms of resources, and teams with a top-tier coach they haven't locked into an extension already may have to get ready to fight to keep their coach in town. Michigan hired Moore to keep things on track after Jim Harbaugh left for the NFL, but they never quite reached those same heights, falling short of the Playoff in Moore's two seasons at the helm. Getting back to the Playoff and contending for Big Ten championships will be the expectation for another coach, and with Michigan clear of the NCAA investigation into Connor Stalions and the sign-stealing scandal, they should be viewed as one of the nation's top jobs. Who will be Michigan's top candidates after starting a late search? Let's dive into the names they'll be pursuing. \n\n        \n            \n                Michigan's next coach won't just have to win, he must rehab a blue blood's tarnished reputation\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n    \n                                        \n    Kalen DeBoer, Alabama coachDeBoer's been on and off of the hot seat at Alabama, and he is expected to be the top target for the Wolverines. The Crimson Tide snuck into the College Football Playoff as the 9-seed, but after a lopsided loss to Georgia in the SEC title game, there are still skeptics in Tuscaloosa that DeBoer is the right man for the job. The expectations following Nick Saban were always going to be nearly impossible to meet for DeBoer, and if he were looking for a soft landing before the Tide faithful can run him out of town, he'd be hard-pressed to find a better option than Michigan. The Wolverines have tons of financial resources, an elite young quarterback in Bryce Underwood and plenty of desire to close the gap on their hated rivals in Columbus. DeBoer is a midwest guy and might view Michigan as a better long-term fit on a personal level. When he was at Washington, Michigan was always regarded as a spot where DeBoer could jump. Alabama came open first, and here we are. \nAt this point in the carousel, with so many top names inking contract extensions or already taking other jobs, Michigan won't have its pick of the litter as it might in a normal situation. DeBoer represents their best chance to land one of the country's best coaches with experience heading up a Playoff program, and they will likely make a strong run at him. It's worth noting that DeBoer's Alabama buyout would only cost the Wolverines $4 million, according to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The most fascinating thing to watch will be how hard Alabama fights to keep DeBoer in Tuscaloosa. They could certainly match just about any offer Michigan could come up with, but they will have to decide if they want to make that kind of commitment or take a spin around the carousel themselves. \n    \n                                        \n    Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame coachFreeman has been a name floating around a lot this year, and most recently he has been picking up a bunch of buzz about a potential leap to the NFL. It remains to be seen whether he has a desire to take his talents to the professional level, but if Freeman is at all unhappy with his situation at Notre Dame and looking for an exit, Michigan would certainly make for an interesting home. \nIt should be noted that much of Freeman's experience has been at two of Michigan's longtime rivals. He played at Ohio State and has been at Notre Dame since 2021 as defensive coordinator for Brian Kelly for a year before taking over as head coach. We saw with Kelly that a Notre Dame coach can be wooed away by a big contract and promises of a grander financial commitment. Michigan can certainly make that case, but Freeman would have to really be looking for an exit after this year's Playoff snub to bolt for a hated rival (even if they don't play annually anymore). \n    \n                                        \n    Lincoln Riley, USC coachRiley is another name that popped up earlier in the coaching silly season as someone who might be available for the right price, with questions about how hard USC would fight to keep him. \nThat was before Riley and USC put the finishing touches on the nation's No. 1 overall recruiting class, and he would have to leave what appears to be a bright future in L.A. -- and a huge contract -- to make an in-conference jump to Michigan. That said, there was a time where it seemed impossible he'd ever leave Oklahoma before he bolted for Los Angeles.While the Trojans' recruiting class is packed with tantalizing talent, Riley knows better than anyone how vital having an elite quarterback talent is to success. His best years have coincided with Heisman Trophy winning QBs, and if he viewed Underwood as that kind of talent, getting two years with him would be a very tempting opportunity. On top of that, given the investment Michigan made to bring Underwood in, Riley wouldn't have any concerns about whether the Wolverines will pony up to keep the elite talent flowing into Ann Arbor. \n    \n                                        \n    Jedd Fisch, Washington coachFisch is finishing up his second season as the coach at Washington, and his name has been linked to a few job openings -- most notably his alma mater, Florida.\nFisch is a true journeyman in the coaching business and has ties to plenty of programs beyond the Gators, including Michigan. He made a two-year stop in Ann Arbor from 2015-16 as the pass-game coordinator and quarterbacks coach under Jim Harbaugh and will likely garner at least some interest from the Wolverines, depending on how things unfold with their dream candidates.After turning things around at Arizona, Fisch has taken Washington to bowl games in back-to-back years and appears to have the Huskies on an upward trajectory as well. The one constant in Fisch's coaching career is changing locales, as his longest tenure was a four-year stint as an offensive assistant with the Ravens in the NFL. That's led many to wonder if he might be looking for his next gig, and Michigan would represent quite the opportunity if it came his way.\n    \n                                        \n    P.J. Fleck, Minnesota coachMinnesota has become a very steady program under Fleck's guidance, but one wonders if he'd be willing to flip to the other side of the Little Brown Jug if Michigan came calling. \nFleck's gone 65-44 in his nine seasons at the helm of the Gophers, missing a bowl game only twice in that span and has made five straight. If Michigan can't pry one of those bigger names away from a marquee program, Fleck could be someone that interests them. We've never seen Fleck at a program with the kinds of resources Michigan has, and he could be intrigued to find out what he could do with that kind of investment. At the same time, there is the risk that he's a program builder but not the kind of coach that maximizes elite talent to the level Michigan hopes. That's the question the Wolverines would have to ask, but if they strike out on the biggest names on their list, they could certainly do much worse than bringing Fleck back to the state of Michigan. \nBrian Kelly, former LSU coachKelly got his start at Grand Valley State before going to Central Michigan, and perhaps the Wolverines will look to bring him back to the Great Lakes State after his dramatic ouster from LSU.Kelly's track record of success speaks for itself with a 297-109-2 career record, but Michigan would have to decide whether he's the kind of culture fit they're looking for. It became quickly evident that Kelly did not mesh well with the folks down at LSU, which is why he found himself out of a job as soon as things turned south. They also would have to decide how much of LSU's struggles this year fell at the feet of Kelly and how much were a larger symptom of a program in a bit of disarray. The Tigers were supposed to be Kelly's next great offense but fell flat, and given Michigan is hoping to find a spark on that side of the ball, that would be a bit of a concern. \nIt would be a fascinating reunion between Kelly and Underwood, who was originally committed to play for Kelly at LSU before getting poached late in the process by the Wolverines.\n    \n                                        \n    Where to get more on the Michigan coaching search If you want all of the latest Michigan news and scoop, there's no better place than TheMichiganInsider.

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs have never missed the playoffs during Patrick Mahomes' career, but that run is in danger of ending this season and it could happen as soon as Week 15. The 6-7 Chiefs are on the cusp of playoff elimination and there are several scenarios that could see them knocked out on Sunday. The good news for the Chiefs is that a lot would have to happen for them to be eliminated this week and it would start with a loss to the Chargers, a game where Kansas City is currently favored by 4.5 points. Let's take a look at the three most likely elimination scenarios for Kansas City (via Joe Ferraira):  1. Chiefs loss + Jaguars win (over Jets) + Bills win (over Patriots) + Texans win (over Cardinals)Breakdown: The Jaguars (-13.5) and Texans (-9.5) are both huge favorites on Sunday. As for the Bills, they opened as a favorite, but they're now a slight 1.5-point underdog to the Patriots. If the Bills want any shot at winning the AFC East, they have to beat New England, so they'll be extra motivated. If the Chiefs lose to the Chargers, this could certainly be the scenario that ends up knocking them out of playoff contention. \n\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 15 NFL picks: Bills beat Patriots in AFC East battle, Packers knock off Broncos on road\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n2. Chiefs loss + Jaguars win (over Jets) + Bills win (over Patriots) + Colts win (over Seahawks)Breakdown: The Colts just lost Daniel Jones for the season and there's a good chance they're going to be starting Philip Rivers on Sunday, who just came out of retirement after four years away. The Colts are a 13-point underdog in Seattle, so for this scenario to happen, Indy would have to pull off a big upset. 3. Chiefs loss + Bills win (over Patriots) + Colts win (over Seahawks) + Texans win (over Cardinals)Breakdown: Like the second scenario, this scenario also involves the Colts pulling off an upset win over the Seahawks.There are also several other more complicated elimination scenarios -- with most of them involving at least one tie -- but these are the three that would probably have the most realistic chance of happening. \nThe Chiefs' have had an unprecedented run of success with Mahomes. Since taking over the starting quarterback job in 2018, Mahomes has led them to seven straight AFC title games, five Super Bowl appearances and three Super Bowl wins. This year, though, the math definitely isn't working in Kansas City's favor when it comes to making the playoffs and Mahomes is very aware of that. \"We know the chances are getting lower and lower, but I know the guys on this team are going to give everything they have every opportunity they get,\" Mahomes said this week. \nAlthough the Chiefs are on the cusp of elimination, they could also still make the playoffs and we mapped out their path here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After he sat on the free agent market until February last offseason, Pete Alonso found his home much earlier this time around. And, for the first time in his professional career, he won't be with the Mets, as he landed with the Orioles Wednesday on a five-year deal that will make him one of the highest-paid first basemen in MLB history. And it's a move that answers some questions for the Orioles lineup in 2026 and raises plenty more for the Mets. Let's start with what this deal means for Alonso's 2026 Fantasy Baseball value before pivoting to look at the fallout for both the Orioles and Mets lineups. It's an upgrade in park, especially if you take out the years from 2022 and 2024, when the Orioles had the most punishing left field dimensions in baseball. In the four other years of Alonso's career, he would have hit 158 homers at Camden Yards, including 45 in 2025, per Statcast data; in those same four seasons, Alonso would have hit 145 at Citi Field, including just 36 in 2025. One-year park factor numbers are incredibly noisy, but there's no question that Camden played as a much more hitter-friendly park in 2025 after they moved the fences in and lowered them, and while it won't be quite as friendly as it was prior to 2022, it should generally play better than Citi Field.It's a lineup downgrade, or at the very least a lineup context downgrade. The Orioles are deep and full of potential after adding Taylor Ward and Alonso, and this should be a vastly improved offense overall. But Alonso will go from hitting behind Francisco Lindor and Juan Soto to hitting behind … well, not Francisco Lindor and Juan Soto. Jackson Holliday, Jordan Westburg, and Gunnar Henderson could, in theory, be a pretty good top-of-order trio for Alonso to hit behind, but even the rosiest expectations won't put them in the same universe as the Lindor-Soto combo, so expecting a downgrade in run production for Alonso isn't unreasonable. \nOn the whole, it's probably a wash in terms of Alonso's 2026 value. The question is whether the skills gains Alonso showed in 2025 can stick. Alonso shortened his swing a bit without losing any bat speed, and the result was the best quality of contact of his career. His 93.5 mph average exit velocity was his best ever by more than 2 mph, and he managed that without a worst strikeout rate or any real changes in his batted-ball directions. That explains the big improvement in batting average we saw from Alonso, which was backed up by the best xBA (.278) of his career. Alonso has never been a pure pull-side power guy, and that's a narrow path to walk without elite quality of contact – hitting a lot of fly balls to the power alleys can result in a lot of 390-foot outs if you aren't hammering the ball like he did in 2025. Which is why he had emerged in recent years as more of an all-or-nothing power source than he was in 2025. Those gains help explain why he's kind of on an island at first base in drafts, with an early ADP of 28.7 – about half a round behind Nick Kurtz and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and about 20 picks ahead of Rafael Devers, Bryce Harper, and Matt Olson. That Devers/Harper/Olson trio have all fallen a few rounds from last year's drafts, while Alonso has jumped from a 45.6 ADP to his near Round 2 price these days. \nI was probably going to be fading Alonso at this price before this signing, and I'm not sure this should push him any higher. I do have Alonso ranked higher than that Harper/Devers/Olson trio, but I also have him closer in my overall ranks to them than his ADP would suggest. If that gap remains, I'll probably be passing on Alonso, whose batting average risk is just hard to stomach at that price, even if he should be one of the safer bets in the entire league for 40 homers. What about the fallout for the OriolesWell, this does complicate things a bit. The Alonso signing would seem to imply the end of Coby Mayo's time in Baltimore, and that's probably for the best for all parties involved. The former top prospect just hasn't been able to translate his success in the high minors to the majors, hitting just .217/.299/.388 in his most extensive opportunity in the majors in 2025. Of course, 2025 seemed to indicate that Mayo's progression has stalled out, as he also only hit .226/.318/.452 at Triple-A – he had an OPS north of .900 in both 2023 and 2024 at Triple-A. Getting a change of scenery might be the only way Mayo turns this around, and it's also his only real chance at actually playing regularly in 2026 – his attempts to play the corner outfields have never really stuck, and his defense at third base has always been a hurdle to getting playing time. In the long run, he's probably a first baseman or DH, and the Orioles just don't have any room for him at either spot now. Making him a perfect trade candidate.\nNot that Mayo likely has much trade value these days. Neither does Ryan Mountcastle nor Heston Kjerstad, two others whose path to playing time in Baltimore has been seemingly closed off by the signing of Alonso (and the earlier trade for Taylor Ward). Turning some combination of those three into a pitcher would make a ton of sense, but it's not clear any of that trio is enough to get a big pitcher in return, even if all three might still have at least enough upside to project as average starters if they get the chance.The addition of Alonso also causes some problems for the Orioles' catching tandem of Adley Rutschman and Samuel Basallo. Basallo was expected to get some playing time at first base in addition to catcher and DH duties, but that's not going to happen with Alonso around. Basallo should still be the team's primary DH, and ideally, the Orioles will just play both Basallo and Rutschman more or less every day, either behind the plate or at DH. But this trade does give Basallo a little less flexibility, putting a lot more pressure on his bat to play more or less immediately. It didn't in his cup of coffee in 2025, as he hit .165/.229/.330. He was much more productive – like, arguably the best hitter in the league – at Triple-A and is still just 21 years old, so I'm not going to hold his struggles in his first taste of the majors against him much. Especially since he has that long-term contract locked in.\nBut there's no question Basallo has a bit more pressure to hit the ground running. And, for that matter, so does Rutschman, who has gone from looking like a perennial MVP candidate to a below-average hitter over the past year and a half. If Basallo is hitting and Rutschman isn't, that could cut into Rutschman's playing time behind the plate, and if he isn't hitting, there isn't much reason to play him at DH. I'm still ranking Rutschman and Basallo both as top-12 catchers for Fantasy in 2026, but there's a bit more risk involved with taking either (or both) now. And what do the Mets do now? Brandon Nimmo and Edwin Diaz were already out of the picture, and now Alonso follows them out the door, so this roster will look a lot different in 2026 than it has for the past half-decade or so. Credit to the Mets (I guess) for being unsentimental, but that's a lot of production out the door, and Marcus Semien and Devin Williams aren't enough to overcome it. Especially since the Mets already missed the playoffs in the first year of Juan Soto's deal.\nThey have a well-stocked farm system and Steve Cohen's billions, but this is a team that needs some reinforcements right now. As things stand, the Mets seem likely to go into battle in 2026 with Brett Baty as the primary third baseman while Mark Vientos mans first base, and while there's some upside there, that just isn't good enough. Especially with … Ronny Mauricio or Jeff McNeil (coming off Thoracic Outlet surgery) handling DH duties? Yeah, that definitely ain't good enough. There's a Kyle Tucker-shaped hole on this roster, and the offseason would look a whole heck of a lot better with Kyle Tucker filling it. It would look okay with Cody Bellinger, I suppose, but this offense could really use another sure-fire impact bat, and Bellinger definitely isn't that. Of course, there are some big needs on the pitching side, too. The Mets are a smart and well-run organization, but it's fair to say this offseason hasn't gone their way so far, and they've got some work to do to make up for it. \nI suspect they will, and I suspect this lineup will look quite a bit different on Opening Day than it appears right now. But if the Mets decide not to spend a ton of money this offseason, there will certainly be room for Baty, Vientos, McNeil, Luisangel Acuna, Jett Williams, Carson Benge, and possibly Jacob Reimer, Ryan Clifford, and A.J. Ewing to be Fantasy viable options in 2026. But if more than just a couple of them are, things have probably gone pretty wrong for the Mets. Which would be in keeping with how the offseason has gone so far. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The UEFA Champions League's 2025 slate is complete and as the new year approaches, a handful of teams enter Europe's winter break in good standing. Some have already booked a spot in the knockout stages and look certain to clinch top-eight finishes when the competition returns, while others have punched above their weight to dream about a direct berth to the round of 16 come January.Six games into the Champions League season, a few have even begun to build their case as title contenders. The list feels like a somewhat familiar one – last season's semifinalists Arsenal sit atop the league phase table, followed by perennial contenders Bayern Munich and reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain. Previous champions Manchester City, Inter and Real Madrid also crack the top eight and remain the frontrunners for direct passageway to the round of 16, their trophy credentials still quick to spot no matter the ebbs and flows of their campaign so far.It forces the question ahead of the business end of the Champions League season: which ones of these teams are the real deal, and which ones are merely filling in the blank space on the bracket?Champions League tableWDLGFGAGDPTS1.

Kairat015415-111In need of a turnaroundLiverpool (9th), Chelsea (13th), Barcelona (15th)The good news for these teams is that they are still more likely to participate in the knockout rounds than not, while Liverpool can take more confidence from the fact that they are only out of the top eight on tiebreakers. Never say never on a run to the May 30 final at Budapest's Puskas Arena – PSG, after all, went on to win last season's competition despite finishing 15th in the league phase – but it is hard to deny that they each have genuine room for improvement. The Reds, quite simply, have been all over the place this season and should prioritize consistency above all else, while Chelsea's sputtering attack will likely keep them from a trophy lift in the Champions League this season. Barcelona have so far had the most notable fall from grace – they went to the semifinals last season and were well and truly a contender during that run but their defense has been remarkably porous, costing them time and time again. That does not feel like an easy fix, either, between manager Hansi Flick's stylistic choices and the quality of the players at his disposal.\nPretendersAtalanta (5th), Inter (6th), Atletico Madrid (8th)Each of these teams deserves credit for a consistency that has allowed them to rise to the top eight places with two games to go, many of them likely to reach the knockouts with few complications. From there, though, they may have to rely on the luck of the draw – Atalanta's most impressive result of the Champions League season was against an unimpressive Chelsea, which only means so much in terms of a title run. Inter and Atletico Madrid have more star power to speak of but it's unclear if they have enough talent to go all the way.ContendersArsenal (1st), Bayern Munich (2nd), Paris Saint-Germain (3rd), Manchester City (4th), Real Madrid (7th)Admittedly, this is an overly long list but it is hard to rule out any of these teams with so much time left on the clock – and with last season's competition still top of mind. Granted, some of these teams are more realistic contenders than others. Arsenal are the easiest answer to any question about who might win the Champions League next spring, both as the only perfect team left in the competition and as a group with a cohesive idea and a deep squad. Bayern Munich are slowly but surely proving themselves as Europe's elites with a defense-first strategy, while Paris Saint-Germain should still be a contender if they have a majority of their stars around. Manchester City can be iffy but even as Pep Guardiola mounts another rebuild, they manage to win more often than not and just might be able to make a run if things click.\nReal Madrid may be a head-scratcher on this list, but there were elements of their performance in their 2-1 loss to City that offered some encouragement. There is a huge asterisk on this pick, considering it would require Madrid to actually stay on the right track, which is much easier said than done at a club as volatile as that one. Xabi Alonso's intense, high-press approach allowed them to stay competitive against City – and just might be a winning strategy in the long run, too.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Is this it for Xabi Alonso then? Vinicius Junior misses a few chances, Antonio Rudiger goes rogue in his penalty area and Real Madrid conclude that there can be no more time afforded to a coach with a proven track record of success as a player with this club and as a coach in the most remarkable of circumstances.That had been the suggestion in the Spanish press since Saturday's defeat at Celta Vigo. Fail against Manchester City and Alonso was on the brink. By his standards and Madrid's, this team had been wobbling over the last month with two wins and three defeats in their last eight. Florentino Perez has dispensed with coaches for less. But those managers have not been Alonso, a coach who was supposed to be empowered to bring about a \"new era.\" If this is the end, this probably isn't going to be a time period that gets much of an airing on a Perez Eras Tour.And if it is the case that Alonso departs after 22 games, then it is a suitably baffling plot twist for a club that cannot shake its inclination towards the telenovela. You simply have to hang around for the next episode because right now it's not entirely clear why exactly Manchester City beat Real Madrid, and it's not certainly entirely clear why that particular result should cost Alonso his job. To address that latter point first, a second defeat to English opposition means that Madrid are seventh in the league phase of the Champions League with games against Monaco and Jose Mourinho's Benfica to come. Though their old boss would doubtless love to play spoiler, Madrid can probably expect to get six points, and with that, they would be a near lock for top eight. Doubtless, it would be preferable to have the home advantage that comes with a top-two seeding but there is no cause for panic.\nNor is there in La Liga. Again, a four-point deficit to Barcelona is suboptimal, but Alonso has beaten them once this season. In the month since, they have nine points from a possible 18 but scored 10 goals from 14.4 expected goals (xG). A bit of better finishing from those not named Kylian Mbappe, sidelined Wednesday with a muscle issue, and the table might look very different. Fundamentally, there is nothing that has gone wrong on the pitch so far this season that cannot be rectified. Wednesday's display too was by no means a disaster. Giving up over 2.5 xG to City doesn't look nice in isolation but 1.92 of it came in the space of 10 weird minutes late in the first half. Thibaut Courtois spilled a corner, Rudiger got too close to Erling Haaland. Do you sack a manager because two experienced defenders made individual errors? Would you continue to employ him if Brahim Diaz got his header on target, if Vinicius Junior's bicycle kick was struck that bit sweeter or if Mbappe had been a bit fitter and changed this game from the bench?Perhaps not, given so few of the questions around Alonso have been about his ability to coach this team successfully. He can broadly say he has done that. Last season in La Liga and Champions League play, Madrid created shots worth 1.76 non-penalty expected goals (npxG) and gave up 1.17. This season, they are at 1.99 and 1.11, their points per game tally drifting up too. They aren't yet at best-team-in-Europe levels but Alonso knows better than most that this club can take its time to move through the gears. Right now, they are motoring along quite nicely.\nThen again, this is Real Madrid. This isn't a tactics gig, as Thierry Henry explained on the UEFA Champions League Today pre-match show. \"You have a guy there who is coaching a bit too much and not managing enough,\" he said. \"Gareth Bale was sitting there the other day and telling us that at Madrid, what you need to do is manage players.\"I feel sorry for Xabi Alonso because you could see what he did at Leverkusen when he was able to coach a team that was going to listen to what he wanted to do. It's a different ball game.\"\nIt is certainly true that the way Alonso started his managerial career would be asking for trouble at Madrid. When he took his first senior coaching position with Leverkusen, the Spaniard surprised his squad with an obsessive focus on tightening up the defense. Some within the Bay Arena dressing room had expected one of the great deep playmakers of his day to send them straight in at the deep end with front-footed positional play and were surprised by what they got.A young squad who had never won anything as a collective could hardly question Alonso's methods. A group who won the Champions League before many were old enough to hire a car? They might have preconceived notions about what happens (or does not) when they lose the ball. Take, for instance, Vinicius Junior, whose supposed rift with Alonso has been as major plotline through the early months of the season as the goalscoring feats of Mbappe. The vast majority of his career has been under the tutelage of Zinedine Zidane and Carlo Ancelotti, both of whom interpreted the Madrid management gig in laissez-faire fashion. A hands-off approach brought both collective and individual glory without players being summoned in for daily pre-training meetings.Perhaps Wednesday night functioned as a reminder that not everyone has been alienated by Alonso. Rodrygo came out with a punchy defense at the final whistle, insisting, \"We are with [Xabi Alonso]. We need this unity to move forward.\" Their relationship during the Club World Cup had been the first sign of superstars butting up against this new style of management. Rodyrgo's embrace of his coach after his substitution is a reminder that bridges can be built. Jude Bellingham was similarly supportive while Raul Asencio was even more forthright. \n\"We are with Xabi Alonso to the death,\" said the young center back. \"We understand his message. You saw the change of attitude tonight.\" That last line is the most significant. It is easy for players to say one thing to the cameras and another behind closed doors but for much of this game, Madrid played like a team fighting for something or someone. The Vinicius, Rodrygo tandem might have created even more than it did. In the first half in particular, there was much to admire in the defensive organization, the way there was always a second body to block a Jeremy Doku cross with Bellingham and Dani Ceballos working hard without the ball.More than any coach, Alonso finds himself in a results, not performance business, but there was nothing in this game to suggest that future results are beyond Madrid. After all, they have a coach whose methodical approach can have a meaningful impact on the vibes that seem to carry more weight than any predictive metric.\nLeverkusen players adored Alonso's eye for the \"small details.\" By the time he had been in the job for a year, his ability to coach them on so many facets of the game was functioning as a type of management. His team were so prepared and drilled that they came to believe at the deepest level that they could not be beaten. There was a reason for that meme that pitted Alonso's Leverkusen against Madrid in a never-ending, no-one loses sort of game. Alonso had imbued Leverkusen with that very Madrid-ian belief in their own invincibility. He can coach squads and he can motivate them, too. And if a serial winner as a player and coach can't find a way to get these players bought into a more organized way of playing, can anyone? If Alonso goes, is there any point in asking his successor to do much more than take the pre-match press conferences and pose for photos? Perhaps they could pick the dressing room music too and hang the Christmas decorations? After all, should Alonso go, then Madrid are making plain that they want a vibe conductor rather than a tactician. They might as well lean into it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee is expected to hire Jim Knowles as its next defensive coordinator following the firing of Tim Banks earlier this week, Matt Zenitz reports. The move signals a major effort by coach Josh Heupel to re-establish defensive identity after a costly drop-off in performance in 2025.Banks, who was dismissed Monday after five seasons in Knoxville, saw his defense collapse this fall. Once a unit that helped carry Tennessee into the College Football Playoff just a season ago, the Volunteers surrendered 28.8 points per game and allowed 395.5 yards on average -- both third-worst in the SEC.Enter Knowles, who after spending 2025 at Penn State, will not be retained by incoming coach Matt Campbell.Knowles' coaching résumé is among the most decorated for a defensive coordinator. Before Penn State, he spent three seasons as defensive coordinator at Ohio State -- including the 2024 national championship season, when his defense ranked No. 1 in the country in both scoring (12.9) and total defense (254.6).\nEarlier stops at Oklahoma State (2018-2021) and Duke (2010-2017) likewise cemented his reputation as a sharp defensive strategist and solid developer of talent. What does it mean for Tennessee?For Tennessee, the hire represents a clear acknowledgment that 2025's defensive collapse cannot be ignored. Bringing in a coordinator with championship-level pedigree and experience retooling defenses at multiple Power Four programs may be exactly what the Volunteers need to rebound. Especially with questions lingering over depth and scheme consistency after a turnover-heavy roster and porous secondary -- which ranked 115th in the FBS in passing yards allowed per game (248.8) -- derailed the season.But the fit isn't guaranteed to be seamless, and Knowles inherits sizable challenges. Transitioning to his system typically requires an adjustment period, a trend reflected in the modest results during his first seasons at Oklahoma State and Ohio State before each defense made significant Year 2 leaps, followed by even sharper refinement and consistency in Year 3. \nHis only previous SEC experience also came more than two decades ago as a linebackers coach at Ole Miss in 2003, adding another layer of adaptation as he steps back into the conference.Tennessee will likely need to lean on the transfer portal and recruiting to fill holes, particularly in the secondary and along the interior of the defensive front. Why Knowles' adaptability matters for TennesseeOne of the more revealing parts of Knowles' career arc is how flexible he has been when circumstances demand it. Across multiple stops, his defenses have reflected not just his own schematic preferences but the realities of the roster in front of him. At Ohio State, that meant shelving some of the three-man front structures and hybrid packages that became staples of his work at Oklahoma State and Duke. The Buckeyes' established four-down philosophy -- and the presence of veteran defensive line coach Larry Johnson deeply rooted in that approach -- forced Knowles to build a top-ranked unit through a different lens. He created a defense that remained aggressive while fitting the strengths of a deep, traditional Big Ten front.\nBut that flexibility has limits. Knowles left Ohio State after a national championship season in part because expanded oversight from Ryan Day narrowed his ability to independently shape the defense. For a coach known for disappearing into the film room and emerging with intricate game plans tailored to matchups and personnel, that autonomy matters. Tennessee could be betting that giving Knowles space -- and players suited to his toolbox -- will unlock the creativity and week-to-week adaptability that have defined his best work.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We are in the final month of the 2025 regular season, with just four weeks of action still left on the docket. Of course, as we get down to the finish line, these final matchups will carry monumental stakes. Already, the Week 15 slate has a handful of clinching scenarios. The New England Patriots can clinch the AFC East title with a win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, while both the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams can punch their tickets with wins. While all we want to dissect heading into this crucial stretch is how these teams match up on the field, injuries will be a storyline. Given that we're so late in the year, just about every team is dinged up to some degree, and that could dictate how some of these games turn out. As most clubs get back onto the practice field for the first time on Wednesday, we'll take the temperature of where they stand health-wise as they release their initial injury report. We'll also look at the final injury report and game designations for Thursday's NFC South matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \nAll NFL odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.Atlanta Falcons at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-4.5)Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Stream on Prime VideoTeamPlayerPositionInjuryStatusFalconsDrake LondonWRKneeOutKyle PittsTEKneeQuestionableJalon WalkerEDGEQuadQuestionableBrandon DorlusDLGroinQuestionableDavid OnyemataDLFootQuestionableBuccaneersSirVocea DennisLBHipOutRashad WisdomSQuadOutCade OttonTEKneeDoubtfulHaason ReddickOLBAnkleDoubtfulMike EvansWRCollarboneQuestionableJalen McMillanWRNeckQuestionableIt's another week that the Falcons will be without top wideout Drake London, who'll miss his fourth straight game due to a knee injury. Meanwhile, Kyle Pitts and edge rusher Jalon Walker are questionable after being limited on Wednesday. On a more positive note, corner A.J. Terrell (neck) was a full participant on Wednesday and carries no injury designation.The Buccaneers are expected to get wideout Mike Evans back after missing the bulk of the year due to a collarbone injury he suffered in Week 7. Despite being listed as questionable, head coach Todd Bowles said Evans has shown everything he needed to in practice to make his return. Both Evans and Jalen McMillan have also been activated off injured reserve.\nBuffalo Bills at New England Patriots (-1.5)The Bills were without tight end Dawson Knox to begin the week of practice due to personal reasons. Outside of that, everyone was accounted for as defensive end Joey Bosa (hamstring, wrist), linebacker Terrel Bernard (elbow), offensive lineman Spencer Brown (shoulder), and Josh Palmer (ankle) were limited. Running back Terrell Jennings (concussion) was the lone player missing from Patriots practice on Wednesday. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore (not injury related) was limited, along with linebacker Harold Landry and offensive tackle Vederian Lowe. Arizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel) did not practice with the Cardinals on Wednesday along with offensive lineman Paris Johnson Jr. (knee), defensive lineman Bilal Nichols (knee), safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (ankle), safety Jalen Thompson (hamstring) and receiver Xavier Weaver (hamstring). Safety Budda Baker, offensive lineman Kelvin Beachum, offensive lineman Evan Brown, linebacker Josh Sweat, and defensive lineman Dalvin Tomlinson were given rest days. Defensive lineman Walter Nolen III (knee), corner Max Melton (heel), offensive lineman Christian Jones (knee), running back Emari Demercado (ankle), and defensive lineman L.J. Collier (knee) were limited. Houston held out running back Wooddy Marks (knee) and Nick Chubb (ribs) to begin the week, along with linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair (ankle), defensive end Denico Autry (knee), offensive tackle Trent Brown (hand), corner Kamari Lassiter (foot), and defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins (elbow, shoulder). Tight end Harrison Bryant (neck, shoulder), receiver Justin Watson (calf) along with linebackers Jamal Hill (hamstring) and E.J. Speed (knee) were limited. Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)Geno Smith is dealing with a shoulder injury and is unlikely to play on Sunday. The veteran did not practice on Wednesday, which puts Kenny Pickett in line to start in Week 15. Safety Jeremy Chinn (back), defensive end Maxs Crosby (knee, shoulder), and tight end Ian Thomas (calf) also did not practice. Las Vegas designated offensive tackle Kolton Miller to return from injured reserve. He was limited along with receiver Alex Bachman (thumb), tight end Michael Mayer, and receiver Dont'e Thornton (concussion). Philadelphia was without offensive tackle Lane Johnson (foot) and defensive tackle Jalen Carter (shoulder) at practice on Wednesday. Meanwhile, guard Landon Dickerson (calf) was limited. Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-4.5)Los Angeles held out receiver Derius Davis (ankle), linebacker Troy Dye (hip), defensive back Elijah Molden (hamstring), and offensive lineman Trey Pipkins III (ankle).

Corner Trent McDuffie (knee) was limited. New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-12.5)The Jets were missing 10 players on Wednesday, which included quarterback Justin Fields (knee) and Tyrod Taylor (groin). If neither can play, that would throw Brady Cook in as the starter in all likelihood. Running back Breece Hall (knee), edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II (rest), linebacker Kiko Mauigoa (neck), defensive lineman Harrison Phillips, tight end Stone Smartt (concussion), tight end Mason Taylor (neck), corner Azareye'h Thomas (shoulder), and linebacker Quincy Williams (hand) were also held out. Jacksonville listed quarterback Trevor Lawrence as a limited participant in practice on Wednesday due to an ankle injury. Receiver Parker Washington (hip), tight end Quintin Morris (ankle), offensive lineman Ezra Cleveland (shoulder), offensive lineman Walker Little (concussion), safety Andrew Wingard (concussion), and defensive lineman B.J. Green II (knee) were also limited. \nWashington Commanders at New York Giants (-2.5)Commanders head coach Dan Quinn announced Wednesday that Jayden Daniels re-aggravated his left elbow injury against the Vikings and will be held out for Week 15. Marcus Mariota will start. Meanwhile, defensive end Drake Jackson (groin, knee), corner Jonathan Jones (rib), outside linebacker Von Miller (rest), running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. (groin), offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil (rest), and linebacker Bobby Wagner (knee) did not practice. New York opened up the week of practice without several players: defensive lineman D.J. Davidson (illness), linebacker Victor Dimukeje (knee), punter Jamie Gillan (left knee), defensive back Nic Jones (shoulder), defensive lineman Rakeem Nunez-Roches (ankle), receiver Gunner Olszewski (concussion), linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux (shoulder) and offensive lineman Greg Van Roten (shoulder). Tight end Theo Johnson (toe) was limited. \nBaltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati BengalsLamar Jackson did not practice on Wednesday, which is becoming a weekly occurrence. This marks the fifth straight week where the Ravens quarterback has missed at least one day of practice. This time, the team noted that it was merely a rest day. Corner Chidobe Awuzie (shoulder) also did not practice, while running back Keaton Mitchell (knee), outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot), and corner Nate Wiggins (foot) were limited. \nCincinnati cleared rookie pass rusher Shemar Stewart (knee) to practice and designated him to return from injured reserve. He was a full participant on Wednesday, while receiver Tee Higgins (concussion) was limited. Defensive end Trey Hendrickson (hip, pelvis) was listed as a non-participant, but he is not expected to return to the team this season after undergoing surgery. Safety PJ Jules (ankle) also did not practice.\n        \n            \n                Tee Higgins back in concussion protocol after returning twice vs. Bills, raising questions about NFL's process\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (-7.5)The Browns were missing several players during Wednesday's practice. Guard Joel Bitonio (knee, back), offensive tackle Jack Conklin (concussion), safety Grant Delpit (illness, groin), defensive tackle Mason Graham (rib), defensive tackle Adin Huntington (quad), tight end David Njoku (knee), running back Dylan Sampson (calf, hand), guard Wyatt Teller (calf), receiver Cedric Tillman (concussion, rib), and cornerback Denzel Ward (calf) all missed the session. Tight end Brenden Bates (ankle), cornerback Tyson Campbell (shoulder), receiver Malachi Corley (concussion), safety Rayshawn Jenkins (glute), liinebacker Carson Schwesinger (ankle), and quarterback Deshaun Watson (Achilles) were all limited. Chicago was missing defensive back Kyler Gordon (groin) and running back Travis Homer (ankle) from practice on Wednesday. However, the club ran a walkthrough so this injury report is an estimation. That said, receiver Rome Odunze (foot) was limited along with defensive back Tyrique Stevenson (hip), and receiver Olamide Zaccheaus. \nCarolina Panthers (-2.5) at New Orleans SaintsAfter missing the past two games, Carolina listed both center Cade Mays (ankle) and linebacker Christian Rozeboom (hip, hamstring) as full participants on Wednesday. Corner Jaycee Horn and linebacker Claudin Cherelus were limited as they remain in concussion protocol. Running back Alvin Kamara (knee, ankle) did not practice with the Saints on Wednesday, nor did safety Justin Reid or offensive tackle Asim Richards (ankle). Offensive tackle Taliese Fuaga (ankle), running back Devin Neal (abdomen), and defensive end Chris Rumph II (wrist) were limited. Indianapolis Colts at Seattle Seahawks (-14)Indianapolis listed quarterback Riley Leonard (knee) as a full participant in practice. With Daniel Jones out for the year, Leonard is an option to start in Week 15, as is Philip Rivers, who signed with the practice squad. Meanwhile, defensive end Tyquan Lewis (ankle), offensive tackle Braden Smith (concussion, neck), corner Sauce Gardner (calf), and receiver Anthony Gould (foot) were non-participants in practice. Defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck) was limited. \nSeattle held out tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee) from Wednesday's practice, and listed safety Julian Love (hamstring), safety Ty Okada (oblique, shoulder), defensive tackle Jarran Reed (wrist, thumb), tight end Eric Saubert (calf), and center Jalen Sundell (knee) as limited.\n        \n            \n                Philip Rivers explainer: Why is the 44-year-old QB making his NFL return by signing with the Colts?\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGreen Bay Packers (-2.5) at Denver BroncosGreen Bay did not have running back Josh Jacobs on Wednesday due to a knee injury. He was the lone player absent, but there were a lot of limited players.

Tight end Nate Adkins (knee) and guard Ben Powers (biceps) were limited. \nTennessee Titans at San Francisco 49ers (-12.5)Tennessee rested a handful of players during Wednesday's practice, but defensive end C.J. Ravenell (toe) and linebacker James Williams Sr. (illness) were held out due to injury. Meanwhile, corner Jalyn Armour-Davis (Achilles) and center Lloyd Cushenberry III (foot) were limited. San Francisco held out linebacker Tatum Bethune (ankle), linebacker Nick Martin (concussion), and defensive end Sam Okuayinonu (ankle) due to injury reasons. Meanwhile, defensive tackle Kevin Givens (personal), running back Christian McCaffrey (rest), and offensive tackle Trent Williams (rest) did not practice due to non-injury reasons. Fullback Kyle Juszczyk (ribs) was limited.Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (-5.5)The Lions listed safety Brian Branch (Achilles) as a non-participant in practice, but that is merely a formality as he's done for the season.

Hockenson (shin) did not practice with the Vikings on Wednesday.

    "body": "\n        The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are, at long last, getting healthy. Tampa Bay activated star wide receiver Mike Evans as well as second-year wide receiver Jalen McMillan on Wednesday, a day before they are set to take on the Atlanta Falcons on \"Thursday Night Football.\"Evans, 32, broke his collarbone and suffered a concussion in Week 7 against the Detroit Lions, landing hard after nearly reeling in a deep pass from Baker Mayfield. That had been Evans' first game back since Week 3, when he suffered a hamstring injury. Coach Todd Bowles said after the Lions game that the collarbone injury would keep Evans \"out mostly toward the end of the year.\"Evans has 14 catches for 140 yards and one touchdown, so while his record-tying streak of 11 straight 1,000-yard receiving seasons is over, the fact that he's returning on the earlier side of the timeline set by Bowles is a very good sign for Tampa Bay.\n        \n            \n                Buccaneers vs. Falcons prediction: Can Baker Mayfield and Co. get back on track to secure NFC South lead?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMcMillan, 23, reeled in 37 catches for 461 yards and eight scores last season as a third-round rookie out of Washington; the eight touchdown catches were third-most by a rookie in franchise history. Expected to open the season as a starter, McMillan landed awkwardly after trying to catch a high throw in the preseason and suffered a \"severely sprained neck\" that had him in a brace for several months.\nBuccaneers finally getting healthyTampa Bay has battled a litany of injuries this season. Star left tackle Tristan Wirfs underwent knee surgery shortly before the regular season began and missed the first three games of the season. Likewise, wide receiver Chris Godwin, recovering from a severe leg/ankle injury last season, did not debut until Week 4. Godwin then missed Weeks 6-11 with a fibula injury. Bucky Irving recently returned to the lineup after missing extensive time due to foot and shoulder injuries. Up front, right tackle Luke Goedeke missed extensive time with a foot injury and right guard Cody Mauch suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 2.Despite that, Tampa Bay is 7-6 and atop the NFC South. Mayfield has thrown for 2,722 yards, 20 touchdowns and six interceptions. Rachaad White and Sean Tucker played well in Irving's absence, and standout first-round rookie Emeka Egbuka has shined with 806 receiving yards and six touchdowns. He and seventh-round rookie Tez Johnson (five touchdowns) have been on the receiving end of more than half of Mayfield's touchdowns.Tampa Bay is yet to play a snap this season with its top three wide receivers -- Evans, Egbuka and Godwin -- on the field together.\nPlayoff impactEvans' and McMillan's expected returns could provide a boost to ensure Tampa Bay captures its fifth straight division title, especially considering the Buccaneers face division opponents three times over the next four weeks, including the Panthers twice.Week 15: Atlanta FalconsWeek 16: at Carolina PanthersWeek 17: at Miami DolphinsWeek 18: Carolina Panthers\n            ",

UFC 324, the first event under the Paramount+ partnership, will be held on Jan. 24 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, featuring a main event that pits Justin Gaethje against Paddy Pimblett for the interim lightweight title.Plus, women's bantamweight champion Kayla Harrison will defend her title against Amanda Nunes with the women's G.O.A.T. coming out of retirement for her first fight since 2023.UFC CEO Dana White announced the card for the first numbered event of 2026 during halftime of the Chiefs vs. Cowboys game on Thanksgiving.The winner of the interim title fight between Gaethje and Pimblett is expected to earn a lightweight title unification bout with reigning champion Ilia Topuria later in the year.\nThere is no fighter more exciting than Gaethje. The former interim champion has accumulated an astounding 14 post-fight bonuses in as many UFC appearances. Pimblett is no stranger to highlight-reel showings in the cage or on the microphone. He's undefeated in the UFC at 7-0, earning five performance bonuses.The co-main event sees Nunes, UFC's greatest female athlete -- an all-time great regardless of gender -- come out of retirement for a title opportunity. The UFC Hall of Famer and former two-division champion returns from a two-and-a-half-year break to add another big name to her hit list, which already includes Ronda Rousey, Cris Cyborg, and Valentina Shevchenko. Harrison is a two-time Olympic gold medalist who stands 3-0 since joining the promotion last year.\"Saturday, Jan. 24, in Las Vegas kicks off this incredible partnership with Paramount,\" White said in a press release. \"I  am so excited for UFC fans that our first card has six current and  former champions, including the long-awaited return of the greatest  female fighter of all time, which is definitely the biggest women's  fight ever. \n\"Also, in the main event, we have Justin Gaethje versus Paddy  Pimblett for the interim lightweight title to see who will face Ilia  Topuria later this year on Paramount+. This card is absolutely stacked  -- every fight is a must-see. This deal is such a huge win for fans with  no more pay-per-view. I look forward to 2026 being our best year ever.\"     An impressive main card bolsters UFC's Paramount debut. Former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley starts his journey back to title contention against perennial contender Song Yadong. Surging heavyweight contender Waldo Cortes Acosa fights for the sixth time in 10 months, this time against fan favorite Derrick Lewis. Cortes Acosta fought twice in November, both against lower-ranked contenders, before accepting yet another fight against an opponent behind him in the pecking order.\nRounding out the announcements is the return of featherweight contender Arnold Allen, off an 18-month layoff, against knockout artist Jean Silva.The UFC 324 main card will start at a new time of 9 p.m. ET. The preliminary card and early prelims will begin at 7 p.m. and 5 p.m., respectively.

On his third carry of the night, Henry passed NFL legend Jim Brown on the all-time career rushing list. Henry entered the game with 12,294 yards across 10 NFL seasons. Brown, who retired after the 1965 season as the NFL's all-time rushing leader, ran for 12,312 yards during his nine-year Hall of Fame career. Henry passed Brown on a 28-yard touchdown run that capped off Baltimore's first drive. \nEarlier this season, Henry became only the 17th player of the 12,000-yard club, which is especially notable as every eligible member of that club is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also recently passed Hall of Famer Walter Payton for fifth all time in career touchdown runs. \nNFL all-time career rushing list PlayerYards1. Emmitt Smith**18,3552. Walter Payton**16,7263.

Steven Jackson11,43820. John Riggins**11,352** -- Pro Football Hall of Fame members Henry passing Brown is notable history indeed. Brown, who in 1964 led the Browns to their most recent NFL title, was the league's career rushing leader at the time of his retirement despite playing only nine seasons. In those nine seasons, he won a whopping eight rushing titles in addition to being an eight-time All-Pro and three-time league MVP. \nWhile rubbing shoulders with some of the greatest running backs is history, Henry also makes a case as the best running back of his generation. A five-time Pro Bowl player, Henry is just one of nine players to rush for over 2,000 yards in a season. Last year, his first with the Ravens, Henry led the NFL in rushing touchdowns for a third time while setting the single-season record for rushing yards gained by a player over the age of 30. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Packers quarterback threw for 234 yards and four touchdowns to lead his team to a 31-24 win over the Detroit Lions. Love is now 3-0 on Thanksgiving and in those three games, he's thrown nine touchdowns and zero interceptions. The win gives the Packers a season sweep over the Lions and puts them in a spot where they could be on top of the division by the end of the weekend. If the Bears lose to the Eagles on Black Friday, the Packers will take over sole possession of first place. The win by Green Bay was the first game in a Thanksgiving tripleheader. In the second game, the underdog Cowboys pulled off a huge upset with a 31-28 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. With the loss, the Chiefs are now 5-6 on the season, which puts them in serious danger of missing the playoffs for the first time since Patrick Mahomes became their starting QB in 2018. The Thanksgiving nightcap will feature the return of Joe Burrow with the Cincinnati Bengals heading to Baltimore to face the Ravens in an AFC North showdown. The Bengals dealt with some Thanksgiving travel delays and didn't get into Baltimore until after midnight. \nWith that in mind, let's get to our Thanksgiving grades.Green Bay 31-24 over DetroitDallas 31-28 over Kansas CityCincinnati (3-8) at Baltimore (6-5), 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC)\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The star wideout remained on the turf for a few minutes while he was evaluated by trainers. Eventually, St. Brown got up and walked off the field and straight to the locker room. He was initially listed as questionable to return, but was officially ruled out in the third quarter. In 11 games this season, St. Brown has caught 75 passes for 884 yards and nine touchdowns. The Lions are already without tight end Sam LaPorta today, who was placed on injured reserve earlier this month with a back injury, and wide receiver Kalif Raymond, who is inactive with an ankle injury. \nDan Campbell will call upon Jameson Williams, Tom Kennedy, plus the rookies Isaac TeSlaa and Dominic Lovett, to potentially step up in St. Brown's absence. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 South Carolina and No. 4 Texas are facing off in the inaugural women's basketball Players Era championship game on Thursday. The game is a rematch from the 2025 Final Four. Later on Thanksgiving, No. 3 UCLA and Duke will battle it out in the third-place game.Texas earned its spot with a 76-65 win against UCLA on Wednesday. The Longhorns were missing Aaliyah Crump and Bryanna Preston due to injury, but they still got their biggest win of the season so far. Their defense was visibly disrupting for the Bruins, who ended the night with 20 turnovers. Rori Harmon led Texas' offense with 26 points, and her overall performance led coach Vic Schaefer to say this game showed why she is \"the best point guard in the country.\"\nSouth Carolina picked up a 83-66 win against Duke, a team that is currently out of the AP Top 25 but was ranked in the top 10 during preseason. The Blue Devils kept it close early in the game, but South Carolina got the job done with Joyce Edwards and Madina Okot scoring a combined 45 points. Okot also completed a double-double with 13 rebounds. Just like in the men's tournament, which expanded to 18 teams this year, each participating is set to receive $1 million in NIL money. The players get all the money, which means each of them will receive around $75,000. Other than the money, the elite lineup is a great opportunity for the teams to test themselves against top competition early in the season. Founders of the event also believe this is an opportunity to get a brighter spotlight on college basketball during the fall.\n\"College basketball has always started in November. But let's give it more,\" Players Era co-founder Seth Berger told CBS Sports. \"Let's give everyone a reason to watch, not just the most hardcore of the fans. So first and foremost, I thought there was an opportunity to create a great American sporting event, a tentpole event in November.\" Women's Player Era schedule, scoresAll times are Eastern\nWednesday, Nov. 26No. 4 Texas 76, No. 3 UCLA 65No. 2 South Carolina 83, Duke 66Thursday, Nov. 27No. 2 South Carolina vs. No. 4 Texas (Championship game) | 8 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxDuke vs. No. 3 UCLA (Third-place game) | 10:30 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxTexas vs. South Carolina predictionThese are two teams that pride themselves on defense, so I think this game will come down to who can find, and keep, momentum on offense. While both programs worked on getting stronger in this area during the summer and added valuable weapons, Texas probably had the most dramatic improvement since their Final Four meeting (a 17-point South Carolina win). The Longhorns made six 3-pointers against UCLA, which is not a particularly high number, but they did it without Aaliyah Crump and this was also not at all their forte last season. I like the overall potential we are seeing from Texas, especially with how quickly they adjusted with injuries ahead of this tournament. Although this is not an easy decision because South Carolina is always a dangerous opponent, the Longhorns already made a statement in Las Vegas with how they handled a very good UCLA team. Pick: Texas\n            ",

The Beavers are targeting Alabama assistant head coach JaMarcus Shephard, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz.Shephard has been at Alabama since joining Kalen DeBoer's staff in 2024. Over the last two seasons, Shephard has served as the Crimson Tide's assistant head coach, co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach.This season, Shephard has helped build an offense that ranks 25th in the country in points per game at 33.8 and ninth in passing yards per game at 292.5. The offense has been humming for much of the season, and quarterback Ty Simpson has had a breakout campaign. Shephard will try to bring some of that magic with him to Corvallis.\nPrior to his tenure in Tuscaloosa, Shephard was with DeBoer at Washington, where he worked as the assistant head coach, passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach.After to playing college football at DePauw, Shephard began his coaching career at Northrop High School in Indiana. From there, he worked his way up through the ranks with stops at Western Kentucky, Washington State and Purdue.\nShephard will lead Oregon State into the new Pac-12, which will begin with the 2026 season and includes programs like Boise State and Colorado State. Shephard replaces former coach Trent Bray, who went 5-14 in 19 games.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Plenty of times in recent college football history, there have been cases where a rivalry is created out of thin air and foisted upon fan bases as a real thing. That could've been the case when Nebraska joined the Big Ten and needed a new team to play on Black Friday after spending the previous two decades facing Oklahoma or Colorado.Iowa seemed a natural choice, but the Hawkeyes had other traditional rivals in the Big Ten, so nothing was guaranteed.Well, here we are, 15 years later, and there's very little pretending still being done. These fan bases are going after each other all year long, and some on both sides might even tell you they dislike the other more than their other older, traditional rivals. Both teams enter the game licking some wounds. Iowa was a playoff contender a few weeks ago, but close losses to Oregon and USC ended those hopes. Nebraska had a shot too before quarterback Dylan Raiola broke his leg.Now they enter the final week of the regular season with one thing in mind: ruin the other's Thanksgiving weekend.\nIowa vs. Nebraska: Need to know  Iowa has controlled the Big Ten rivalry: These two played plenty of times before sharing a conference, and Nebraska leads the all-time series 30-22-3. However, Nebraska's lead was much larger before it entered the Big Ten. Nebraska won the first two meetings in 2011 and 2012, but Iowa's taken 10 of 12 since, including the last two. Iowa has also won six straight meetings at Memorial Stadium.  Iowa loves November: The Hawkeyes lost their first two games in November this season, which is a rarity for them. Those losses dropped their record in the month to 19-4 since the 2020 season. It's the fourth-highest win percentage among FBS teams in that time.  Nebraska looking to end a nearly decade-long drought: If the Cornhuskers get the win here it'll give them a record of 8-4 on the season. That's a big deal because it would be the first time the Huskers won eight games in a season since 2016. It would also be the first time they won five Big Ten games since that same season when they finished 6-3 in conference play.\n  Where to watch Iowa vs. Nebraska live  Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Memorial Stadium -- Lincoln, NebraskaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ PremiumIowa vs. Nebraska prediction, picks\nWe throw out the record books in rivalry games like this because anything can happen, so I'm not sure who will win, or who will cover. However, I don't expect there to be a lot of points scored in this one. It's going to be cold at Memorial Stadium, and with TJ Lateef at QB for the Cornhuskers now, this team has leaned heavily on its rushing attack. Iowa's been a run-heavy team all year. Unless we see a lot of explosive rushing plays (not out of question) or numerous defensive and special teams scores (also not out of the question!), I don't think either offense does enough to put a lot of points on the board. After all, the last two meetings have finished with 13-10 scores.  Pick: Under 38.5Who will win and cover in each Week 14 college football rivalry game?

Now, in Week 13, those hopes are set to be realized, with the star quarterback expected to make his anticipated return against the rival Baltimore Ravens.In theory, Burrow's return couldn't come at a more perfect time. The Bengals are undeniably desperate, looking to avoid their fifth straight loss after dropping eight of nine contests since Burrow's exit, and yet the AFC North race is far from over. The Ravens are technically on top at 6-5, but their own signal-caller, Lamar Jackson, hardly looks himself. And the division's second-place squad, the Pittsburgh Steelers, are no firmer thanks to a streaky defense and banged-up Aaron Rodgers.Yet if the Bengals couldn't even win while Burrow's emergency fill-in, Joe Flacco, enjoyed big-play production earlier this year, should we really expect a different outcome for Cincinnati on Thursday night? Either way, the third and final matchup of this year's 2025 Thanksgiving slate is must-see material.Bet Ravens vs. Bengals at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch Bengals-Ravens on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Bengals liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium (Baltimore)TV: NBCFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -7, O/U 51.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            How ready is Joe Burrow, really? Coach Zac Taylor insists his quarterback is \"in good shape\" after a nine-game absence. It helps Burrow also got some practice reps in ahead of the Bengals' last game. Still, the Pro Bowler is returning earlier than initially expected from a severe turf toe injury, and we just saw in San Francisco, with Brock Purdy, what can happen when recovery timelines are rushed. Up against an improved Ravens defense on a short week, this profiles as a tall task for No. 9.Can the Bengals slow Derrick Henry? The Ravens' star running back has been much more erratic this year than last, but he's helped carry Baltimore's grind-it-out attack since Lamar Jackson's return from injury, including with three touchdowns over the last two weeks. After mustering just 3 yards per carry against the New York Jets, this could be just the matchup for him to find daylight, as the Bengals are surrendering 156 rushing yards per game, which is ranked 31st in the entire NFL.Can Ja'Marr Chase single-handedly outrace Baltimore's secondary? The Ravens were surprisingly docile on defense to open the year, but they've tightened up since mid-October, allowing 17 or more points just once during their five-game win streak. Chase is arguably the NFL's top playmaker out wide, especially when Burrow is feeding him downfield opportunities, but he's coming off a one-game suspension and will be without top running mate Tee Higgins, who's sidelined with a concussion.You can bet Ravens vs. Bengals at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nOnce a ball-hawking member of the Ravens' secondary, Stone is coming off his splashiest outing of the 2025 campaign in Cincinnati, logging a pick six against Drake Maye and the New England Patriots to help the Bengals flirt with an upset. Practicing against Lamar Jackson and Co. for his first four NFL seasons might give Stone at least some advantage going into this matchup. But Jackson's recent inefficiencies as a passer might be the best thing working in Stone's favor; let's say Lamar gets a little too impatient while seeking the big play for Baltimore, giving his old friend a chance to steal a possession for the Bengals.Prediction\nIt's true that even when Flacco was dealing as Burrow's replacement, the Bengals failed miserably in other facets, be it situational coaching or general defensive competence. But there might be something to the notion that Burrow's return will put a little extra pep in everyone's step. The Ravens' own scattershot offense is another reason to believe this could be a pristine night for Burrow and Chase to reestablish their home run connection and throw another wrench into an already messy AFC North tangle.That said, we hesitate to put too much trust into a Zac Taylor-led operation that's routinely struggled to look prepared, and Higgins' absence should allow Baltimore to really hone in on lessening Chase's impact. There's also the distinct possibility of Jackson rediscovering his own juice as a rusher, with the bruising Henry by his side, against such a porous run \"D\" in Cincy. We anticipate some holiday fireworks before the buzzer, but give us the home team to scrape one out on Thanksgiving night.\nPick: Ravens 26, Bengals 22 | Bengals +7, Under 51.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nIn late October, the Colorado Avalanche endured a four-game stretch during which they failed to record a victory. In that span, they lost twice in overtime, once in a shootout and suffered their lone regulation defeat of the 2025-26 NHL season to date - a 3-2 setback against the Boston Bruins on Oct. 25 in Beantown.That period seems as if it was a lifetime ago, as Colorado has gone 12-0-1 since. The Avalanche (17-1-5) won all four of their contests last week and enter Week 8, which will run from Friday to Monday, with a 10-game winning streak.The Tampa Bay Lightning and Minnesota Wild also went undefeated in a Week 7 that spanned 10 days, with the former going 5-0-0 and the latter 4-0-0. The Washington Capitals had an impressive week of their own, winning five of their six games.Conversely, Week 7 was unkind to a number of teams, including the Chicago Blackhawks. After going 4-0-1 over the previous two weeks, the Blackhawks recorded just one victory while suffering three regulation losses and falling once in overtime during Week 7. Thanks to the rough patch, Chicago dropped out of this week's top 10 ratings.Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings after Week 7 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 7 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (4-0-0 in Week 7; 17-1-5 overall)Not only did the Avalanche continue to show that they have the most potent offense in the NHL last week, they demonstrated their ability to keep their opponents at bay. Colorado scored six times in two of its four victories, increasing its league-leading total to 94 goals. The team also finished the week with three consecutive shutouts, with Mackenzie Blackwood sandwiching 35 and 26-save performances against the Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, respectively, around Scott Wedgewood's 22-save effort against the Blackhawks. Wedgewood also registered his first career assist in the Avalanche's 6-3 win against the New York Rangers. Nathan MacKinnon was kept off the scoresheet for just the fourth time this season in Colorado's 1-0 triumph over Chicago but finished the week with four goals and two assists. The 2024 Hart Trophy winner leads the league with 18 goals and 39 points while Cale Makar, who netted three tallies and set up two others, tops all NHL defensemen in goals (nine), assists (21) and points (30).2. Dallas Stars (3-1-1; 15-5-4)Dallas began Week 7 with a 3-2 setback against the New York Islanders that ended its five-game winning streak but earned points in each of its next four contests, going 3-0-1. Jason Robertson had a huge week, tallying in each of the Stars' first four outings of the week to extend his goal-scoring streak to seven games, which tied him with Bill Goldsworthy (1970-71), Neal Broten (1981-82) and Dave Gagner (1992-93) for the second-longest run in franchise history behind Brian Bellows' 10-gamer in 1989-90. The 26-year-old Robertson was kept off the scoresheet in Dallas' 3-2 triumph over the Seattle Kraken on Wednesday, halting both the goal-scoring streak and the eight-game point run during which he collected 11 tallies and seven assists. Tyler Seguin collected seven assists last week, while captain Jamie Benn returned to the lineup and recorded a goal and three assists in five games after missing the Stars' first 19 contests due to a collapsed lung. 3. Tampa Bay Lightning (5-0-0; 14-7-2)Don't look now, but the Lightning have soared to the top of the Atlantic Division thanks to their perfect week. In fact, after winning just one of its first seven games this season (1-4-2), Tampa Bay has been one of the best teams in the league, going 13-3-0. Three-time Art Ross Trophy winner Nikita Kucherov continued his offensive wizardry, registering three goals and eight assists over the Lightning's five contests as he extended his point streak to seven games. Jake Guentzel began Week 7 with his eighth career hat trick in a 5-1 triumph over the New Jersey Devils and finished the week with seven points, Brandon Hagel recorded five goals and four assists over the team's last three contests and Anthony Cirelli netted two tallies and set up three others in the same span. Meanwhile, defenseman Darren Raddysh had a strong week offensively, collecting a goal and five assists after notching only four points over his first 12 games this season.4. Minnesota Wild (4-0-0; 13-7-4)The Wild sandwiched triumphs in a shootout and overtime around a pair of shutout victories last week to extend their winning streak to six games and their points run to nine contests (8-0-1). Defenseman Brock Faber landed on the scoresheet in all four of Minnesota's games, scoring three goals and setting up three others, while Matt Boldy registered four tallies and three assists in Week 7. The 24-year-old Boldy has notched at least one point in seven of his last eight outings and is tied for the team lead with Kirill Kaprizov, who recorded three goals and two assists last week to increase his point total to 28. Filip Gustavsson turned aside all 19 shots he faced in a 5-0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins for his second shutout of the season and Jesper Wallstedt followed with his league-leading third blanking as he made 32 saves in a 3-0 triumph over the Winnipeg Jets.5. Carolina Hurricanes (2-2-1; 14-7-2)The Hurricanes began Week 7 with two wins and a shootout loss to extend their points streak to five games but ended it with back-to-back regulation defeats, which prevented them from rising in these power ratings. Sebastian Aho had the best week for Carolina offensively, recording a goal and four assists to increase his season total to a team-high 23 points. The 28-year-old Finnish center celebrated his 700th NHL game on Wednesday with a pair of assists in the Hurricanes' 4-2 loss to the Rangers. Defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere also was productive, scoring two goals and setting up two others.6. New Jersey Devils (2-3-0; 15-7-1)New Jersey fell three spots in the ratings due to a rough start to Week 7. After ending the previous week with a shootout victory against the Washington Capitals in their first game without Jack Hughes (finger surgery), the Devils felt the star forward's absence as they scored a total of four goals while suffering three consecutive losses to finish their five-game road trip at 2-3-0. The club managed to right the ship as it concluded the week with home triumphs over the Detroit Red Wings and St. Louis Blues. The first overall pick in the 2017 NHL Draft, Nico Hischier has been doing his best to fill Hughes' skates as he racked up five goals and four assists over New Jersey's past five games. The 28-year-old Swiss center enters Week 8 with a streak of three straight multi-point performances, while Timo Meier has scored a goal in three consecutive contests.7. Washington Capitals (5-1-0; 13-9-2)The Capitals entered Week 7 having lost eight of their previous 10 games (2-6-2). They turned things around in a big way, scoring 29 goals while winning five of their six contests. Superstar Alex Ovechkin netted six of the tallies and added a pair of assists, while defenseman John Carlson also racked up eight points (two goals, six assists). The NHL's all-time goals leader, Ovechkin registered his 33rd career hat trick in Washington's 8-4 triumph over the Montreal Canadiens on Nov. 20, tying Brett Hull for fourth place in league history behind Wayne Gretzky (50), Mario Lemieux (40) and Mike Bossy (39). Blue-liner Jakob Chychrun had a tremendous week offensively, collecting five goals and four assists. The 27-year-old enters Week 8 with a four-game goal-scoring streak and a run of nine straight contests with at least one point. 8. Ottawa Senators (3-1-0; 12-7-4)Ottawa played only four games over the 10-day span of Week 7 - all on the road - but won three of them. Each of the four contests were decided by one goal, with the Senators posting 3-2 regulation victories against the Anaheim Ducks and San Jose while defeating the Vegas Golden Knights 4-3 in a shootout. Ottawa trailed both the Ducks and Sharks 2-1 before scoring the equalizer late in the second period and the winning goal in the latter half of the third. Drake Batherson was the hero in Anaheim, tallying with 1:58 remaining in regulation, while Tim Stutzle netted the decisive tally in San Jose with 6:38 left. The 23-year-old Stutzle leads the Senators with 11 goals and 23 points.9. Anaheim Ducks (3-2-0; 14-8-1)The Ducks return to the top 10 after going 0-3-0 in Week 6 and dropping out of the ratings. Anaheim played five one-goal games last week and won three, defeating Vegas and the Utah Mammoth in overtime and the Boston Bruins in regulation. Cutter Gauthier, Troy Terry and 19-year-old right wing Beckett Sennecke each recorded at last one point in all five of the Ducks' contests, while Leo Carlsson landed on the scoresheet in each of the team's last four outings. Gauthier enters Week 8 with a five-game assist streak and Terry is in the midst of a four-game run.10. Vegas Golden Knights (2-1-2; 10-5-8)The Golden Knights began last week with a pair of victories and ended it with three straight defeats, although one took place in overtime and another came in a shootout. Jack Eichel scored three goals and set up four others over his last four games to increase his team-leading total to 31 points and tie him for fifth in the NHL. Meanwhile, 22-year-old right wing Braeden Bowman landed on the scoresheet in all five of Vegas' contests, recording three goals and three assists to become the first undrafted rookie to post a five-game point streak since Taro Hirose accomplished the feat in 2018-19 while with the Red Wings. Captain Mark Stone returned to the lineup on Wednesday and tallied in the Golden Knights' 4-3 shootout loss to Ottawa. The 33-year-old right wing, who had missed 16 contests with an upper-body injury, has registered a total of 14 points this season and at least one in each of his seven games.\n            ",

The Dallas Cowboys play host to the Kansas City Chiefs on CBS in what has to be one of the most anticipated regular-season games in a long, long time, and we're not talking about just on Thanksgiving.This is a battle of America's teams, or perhaps America's most hated teams. Whether you love them or hate them, it's going to be hard to turn away on Thanksgiving. NFL past dynasty vs. present dynasty will clash in a critical game with a lot at stake and absolutely no shortage of star power. Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones, Andy Reid, Jerry Jones, Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and more.\nBoth teams are fighting for their playoff lives coming off historic comebacks. It's also a homecoming for Texas native Mahomes. Taylor Swift's fiancé will be playing. Post Malone will be performing at halftime. This game has something for everyone and I cannot wait.Bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:\nHere's everything you need to know to catch Chiefs-Cowboys on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:Where to watch Cowboys vs. Chiefs liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 4:30 p.m. ETLocation: AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Chiefs -3.5, O/U 52.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key storylinesCritical game in playoff hunt with both teams on outside looking in: No game has more at stake this week than the Cowboys and Chiefs. The Chiefs are 6-5 coming off the largest fourth-quarter comeback win of Mahomes' career (down 11 vs. Colts) and the Cowboys are 5-5-1 after matching the largest comeback win in team history (down 21 vs. 8-2 Eagles). Both are on the outside of the playoffs looking in right now as the No. 10 seeds in their respective conferences. There's work to do. The winner will enhance their playoff chances while a loss wouldn't quite burst anyone's playoff bubble, but would do a lot of damage, especially in Dallas' case. Kansas City has more at stake than any team in the league right now. The Chiefs have historic streaks in jeopardy, going for an 11th straight playoff appearance, eighth straight AFC title game and fourth straight Super Bowl this year.Chiefs taking over as America's team: This game is going to bring families together. They might be united in their hatred toward two of the NFL's most polarizing franchises, but at least they'll be in it together. You could call this a clash of the NFL's  \"evil empires,\" two accomplished franchises with giant targets on their backs. A matchup of two of the NFL's last three dynasties (sandwiching the 2001-19 Patriots in the middle). The Cowboys won three Super Bowls in the 90s (1992, 1993, 1995) and the Chiefs have won three since drafting Mahomes (2019, 2022, 2023). It's been well documented the Dallas Cowboys are \"America's Team\" but that torch has probably been passed to the Chiefs. Kansas City has made seven straight AFC title games, but Dallas hasn't made an NFC Championship since 1995, the longest active drought in the conference. Mahomes has more Super Bowl MVPs (three) than Prescott has playoff wins (two). A game with more cinema than anyone could imagine will fittingly be played at the NFL's greatest theater, Jerry World. Mahomes homecoming: It will also be a homecoming for Mahomes. He grew up a diehard Cowboys fan just 1.5 hours from Dallas in Tyler, Texas. Remarkably, this is Mahomes' first NFL start at AT&T Stadium. Be ready for a show though as he put up video game numbers in three games at Jerry World when he was at Texas Tech (all neutral site games vs. Baylor). Mahomes averaged over 500 passing yards and five touchdowns in three games at Jerry World, including a 586-yard, six-touchdown performance in the last game of his college career in 2016. Those are crazy numbers, even if it was on a team known for playing a lot of track meets.George Pickens can continue to feast: If Mahomes doesn't provide the fireworks, look to George Pickens, one of the best offseason additions in the entire NFL. He has the second-most receiving yards (1,054) in the NFL this season and the most ever in a player's first 11 games in a Cowboys uniform. He's quickly reaching star status, especially after the damage he did in the Cowboy's Week 12 comeback vs. the Eagles, racking up 133 yards after Dallas trailed 21-0. He's making a Terrell Owens or Randy Moss type impact and he's seemingly good for one 'You Got Moss'd' moment every game. I'm not saying he's going to have an impact like Moss infamously did at Dallas on Thanksgiving in 1998 (three catches, 163 yards, three touchdowns) but I wouldn't be surprised if he caught a deep ball or two. It won't be easy for Kansas City to take him away, either, with All-Pro Lamb on the other side.Cowboys defense can continue turnaround with Quinnen Williams: It would have been easy to write off the Cowboys' season a few weeks ago because of a slow start and horrible defense but Jerry Jones' bold move to trade a first- and second-round pick at the deadline for Quinnen Williams has immediately paid off. The long-term ramifications could be a different story but for now Dallas has won two straight games since Williams made his season debut and the defense has been a big reason why. The Cowboys dominated the trenches vs. the Raiders and Eagles, ranking among the league leaders in pressures (38, third) and rushing yards allowed (45.0 per game, second) in the last two weeks. Rookie first-round pick Ashton Jeanty couldn't get anything going vs. Dallas rejuvenated the line (six carries, 7 yards) and the same could be said of Saquon Barkley (10 carries, 22 yards). The Chiefs might not have a dynamic back, but Kareem Hunt has been lethal in short yardage situations and Mahomes is always a nightmare outside the pocket so Williams could have a huge impact again.You can bet Chiefs vs. Cowboys at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Travis Kelce's first Thanksgiving game in the NFLFor all the star power on the field, one player might have the most off it. Kelce (and most of the Chiefs) will be playing in their first NFL game on Thanksgiving. Kelce may be slowing down at age 36, but he's still finding a way to be productive. He leads the Chiefs with 674 yards receiving this season and is on pace to become the oldest tight end in NFL history with 1,000 yards receiving in a season. He's never one to shy away from a big stage so expect him to be in the middle of all the action on Thursday. \nPost Malone performs the halftime showThis is a game for everyone. From casual to hardcore NFL fans, Swifties and entertainment enthusiasts. Lifelong Cowboys fan Post Malone will have you covered with the latter as he takes the stage at Jerry World during halftime. Malone has performed at NFL events and games before, including last Christmas when he joined Beyoncé for her halftime show in Houston.\"I'm from Texas. I grew up a Cowboys fan and have been watching this halftime show for years,\" Post Malone said. \"It's a real honor to be part of the Red Kettle Kickoff with The Salvation Army and the Dallas Cowboys and help bring hope to so many people.\"Post Malone has 18 Grammy nominations, 11 Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards and six MTV Video Music Awards. The \"Sunflower\" singer has explored many genres in his career, from rap to country to rock.\nPost Malone joins some elite company as Cowboys Thanksgiving Day performers, dating back to Reba McEntire taking the stage in 1997. Randy Travis, Destiny's Child, Sheryl Crow, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Enrique Inglesias, Selena Gomez and the Jonas Brothers are some other performers in the exclusive group.Prediction\nIt's been an up-and-down season for both teams which is why they are hovering right around .500. It's hard to know which version of each team is going to show up on Thursday, but I'm giving Dallas a slight edge. They play better at home (3-1-1 this season vs. 2-4 on road) while the Chiefs have struggled on the road (1-4). This will be a great test to see if the Cowboys' turnaround on defense is legitimate and they could have a leg up in the trenches with Chiefs Pro Bowl guard Trey Smith expected to miss time with an ankle injury. The Cowboys could suddenly be looking more complete on both sides of the ball so I'm taking them to pull off the upset at home in a close game. Pick: Cowboys 27, Chiefs 24 | Cowboys +3.5, Under 52.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Week 12 wasn't awful for me when it came to my NFL picks, but it wasn't bragging time either.I was 12-2 straight up, which I will take, but just 6-8 against the spread, which I hate. There were some late-game shenanigans that got me there.As it is, I am now 91-87 ATS and 122-55-1 straight up, which are solid records, if not special.This being Thanksgiving Week is always a challenge because there are four games before the weekend even gets here.The three Thanksgiving Day games and the Black Friday game all have intrigue with the Kansas City Chiefs at Dallas Cowboys on CBS being the most intriguing. The ratings for that should be through the roof.I like the Chiefs in that one, but here are the rest of my picks this week.Bet NFL Week 13 games and NFL odds at DraftKings, where new users who win a $5 wager get $300 in bonus bets and three free months of NBA League Pass.Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions (-2.5)Thursday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox  (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Packers impressed in shutting down the Vikings last week, but this will be a bigger challenge. The Lions offense, especially at home, can be explosive. The Packers offense has not been that. But I think they can get to that in this one against a suspect Lions secondary. Look for a lot of points as the Packers to win it with a late sack to stop a Lions threat. Jordan Love will play big. Pick: Packers 34, Lions 31 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookKansas City Chiefs (-3.5) at Dallas CowboysThursday, 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is essentially a playoff game. Neither team can afford a loss with where they are right now. Dallas upset the Eagles at home last week, while the Chiefs beat the Colts. Patrick Mahomes played well in that game and seemed to come alive in the fourth quarter. He will continue that here. Dak Prescott won't keep up. Chiefs take it. Pick: Chiefs 30, Cowboys 24 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookCincinnati Bengals at Baltimore Ravens (-7)Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC\nJoe Burrow is back at quarterback for the Bengals, which makes them a dynamic offense again. The Ravens offense has been stuck in neutral after Lamar Jackson has come back from his hamstring injury. Baltimore just hasn't clicked yet. The Ravens will get the offense going some here, but Burrow will keep it close. Pick: Ravens 31, Bengals 30 | Odds via Caesars Sportsbook, where new users get 20 100% profit boosts with the code CBS20X\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 13 Power Rankings: Rams stay atop field of flawed contenders in most wide-open playoff race in years\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nChicago Bears at Philadelphia Eagles (-7)Friday, 3 p.m. ET on Prime Video\nThis is a big prove-it game in front of the national audience for the Bears. For the Eagles, it's a chance to get back on track after losing to the Cowboys. I think they will. Their defense will force some Caleb Williams turnovers that lead to short fields. And Saquon Barkley will actually get the ball. Eagles win it. Pick: Eagles 30, Bears 21 | Odds via BetMGMSan Francisco 49ers (-4.5) at Cleveland BrownsSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis will be Shedeur Sanders making his first home start for the Browns. He was solid last week in the victory over the Raiders. But it's the Browns defense that will be the difference here. They are suffocating. Look for Brock Purdy to have troubles against them, yet he will find a way to win a close one late.Pick: 49ers 21, Browns 20 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookJacksonville Jaguars (-6.5) at Tennessee TitansSunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a be-careful game for the Jaguars with the Colts on deck next week. It's also a second-consecutive road game at a place they haven't played well in their history. Look for the Titans to hang around in this one, but the Jaguars will pull it out late.Pick: Jaguars 21, Titans 17 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookHouston Texans at Indianapolis Colts (-4.5)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nTexans quarterback C.J. Stroud remains in the concussion protocol, which means he might not play. That would mean another start for Davis Mills, who has played well. It's the Texans defense that has keyed the team's resurgence. The Colts lost to the Chiefs last week, but they will do something here that they needed to do more of in that game: Give it to Jonathan Taylor. Look for the Colts to win a tough, close one. Pick: Colts 23, Texans 21 | Odds via BetMGMAtlanta Falcons (-2.5) at New York Jets Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Falcons are out on the road for a second straight week, which is a challenge. They beat the Saints last week, thanks to the defense. That defense will play well here too, but I think the Jets defense will as well. It's a low-scoring game with the Jets pulling off the upset at home. Pick: Jets 19, Falcons 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookNew Orleans Saints at Miami Dolphins (-6)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Dolphins are coming off a bye and won two straight before that. They've done it with a good running game with De'Von Achane and better defense. The Saints have offensive issues that will come into play here. Miami has seemed to right things and that will show up. Miami takes it.Pick: Dolphins 28, Saints 16 | Odds via BetMGMArizona Cardinals at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-3)Sunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nBucs quarterback Baker Mayfield suffered a shoulder sprain Sunday night that puts his status in doubt for this one. That means it could be Teddy Bridgewater. He is more than capable. The Cardinals have had success with Jacoby Brissett throwing it, but they are one-dimensional. The Tampa Bay defense wasn't good against the Rams, but I think they bounce back here. Bucs take it. Pick: Bucs 27, Cardinals 20 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookLos Angeles Rams (-10.5) at Carolina PanthersSunday, 1 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is a long trip for the Rams, but they get a Panthers team coming off a West Coast Monday night game. That evens it out. The Rams have an MVP leader in Matt Stafford on offense and a defense playing at a high level. Bryce Young wasn't good Monday night and he will struggle here too. Rams take it but the Panthers hang around behind their defense.Pick: Rams 24, Panthers 16 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookMinnesota Vikings at Seattle Seahawks (-11.5)Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET on Fox (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThis is the revenge game for Sam Darnold against the team he played with in 2025. He led that Vikings team to the playoffs and they didn't want him back. Now he's playing at a high level, while the Vikings have quarterback issues. With struggling J.J. McCarthy in the concession protocol, this could be rookie Max Brosmer making his first start. That's tough enough on the road, but in Seattle it's brutal. Seahawks big. Pick: Seahawks 30, Vikings 9 | Odds via Caesars SportsbookBuffalo Bills (-4) at Pittsburgh SteelersSunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThis is a have-to for both these teams. Both are coming off road losses. The Steelers might have Aaron Rodgers back in this one, which they need. The Bills will have extra rest after playing last Thursday. That will give them time to get back on track. I think the Bills passing game will light up the Steelers pass defense. Bills take it. Pick: Bills 31, Steelers 22 | Odds via BetMGMLas Vegas Raiders at Los Angeles Chargers (-10)Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS (Stream on Paramount+)\nThe Chargers are coming off a bye, while the Raiders are coming off a horrible showing in a loss to the Browns. That offensive showing led to the firing of coordinator Chip Kelly. It won't matter. The offense is lifeless because the line is awful. The Chargers don't have a great line either, but give me Justin Herbert over Geno Smith. Chargers take it. Pick: Chargers 24, Raiders 10 | Odds via FanDuel SportsbookDenver Broncos (-6.5) at Washington CommandersSunday, 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC \nThe Commanders will again be without Jayden Daniels against a Broncos team coming off a bye. The Broncos defense is nasty, while the Commanders is not. That defense will be the difference in this game. They will shut down Marcus Mariota and the Commanders offense. Pick: Broncos 22, Commanders 10 | Odds via DraftKings SportsbookNew York Giants at New England Patriots (-7.5)Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET on ESPN/ABC (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)\nThe Patriots are riding a nine-game winning streak, while the Giants have been eliminated from playoff contention. Where is the motivation for the Giants, especially playing on the road for consecutive weeks? Patriots and Drake Maye will head to their bye after this one on a 10-game winning streak as they take care of the Giants. Pick: Patriots 31, Giants 21 | Odds via BetMGM\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 7 Ole Miss and Mississippi State will do battle Friday afternoon for the 122nd installment of the Egg Bowl, one of the most underrated rivalry games in all of college football. Though the Rebels tout the ranking entering this rivalry showdown, there's a lot on the line for both teams. Ole Miss could secure an at-large bid in the College Football Playoff with a win. The Rebels are also hunting their third straight series win, which is something they have not accomplished since 2002-04. They do hold a 66-46-6 all-time advantage against Mississippi State. Mississippi State, meanwhile, could attain bowl eligibility by beating Ole Miss. The Bulldogs have not been to the postseason since 2022, when they downed Illinois in the ReliaQuest Bowl. They also have not finished above .500 in that same span. Mississippi State will have homefield advantage, but Ole Miss is actually 2-0 in the last two games played in Starkville. The Bulldogs have not beat the Rebels within the friendly confines of Davis Wade Stadium in six years. State fans also haven't seen a home victory this season since Sept. 20, when the Bulldogs downed Northern Illinois. \nOle Miss vs. Mississippi State: Need to knowAll eyes on Lane Kiffin: The Egg Bowl is appointment viewing, but a lot of the focus around this year's rivalry game is off the field. Kiffin is currently weighing his future with Ole Miss. The noise swirling around his pending decision -- Florida and LSU are each trying to convince him to fill their coaching vacancies -- got so loud that athletic director Keith Carter released a statement saying that Kiffin's final decision will come the Saturday after Ole Miss' game against Mississippi State. Kiffin's conundrum will surely be on everyone's minds as the game goes on. Ole Miss looking to make program history: Not only can Ole Miss lock down a College Football Playoff spot with a win against its in-state rival, but the Rebels can also make a little history. With a win, they would improve to 11-1. That would tie the program record for the most wins in a season -- set in 2023, when Kiffin's Rebels went 11-2 -- and it would also be the first time that Ole Miss has ever won 11 regular season games.  Mississippi State trying to snap skids: While Ole Miss is on the precipice of making history, Mississippi State is one win away from bowl eligibility. That's a little extra motivation for the Bulldogs, who have not won six-plus games since 2022. They're also 2-21 in conference play since the start of the 2023 season, which is the worst mark among FBS teams. Mississippi State has not won against an AP top-10 team since 2020. It's 0-10 since. The Bulldogs can reverse all of those trends and secure a postseason appearance by downing Ole Miss. \nWhere to watch Ole Miss vs. Mississippi State liveDate: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Davis Wade Stadium -- Starkville, Mississippi TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Ole Miss vs. Mississippi State prediction, picks\nDistractions aside, this is a game that Ole Miss should win handily. The Egg Bowl is a weird game, so it can be hard to predict, but the Rebels have a distinct advantage in almost every major category. They should be able to move the ball at-will against a Mississippi State team that ranks 15th in the SEC in total defense (393.2 yards per game) and scoring defense (28.4 points per game).

    "body": "\n        Auburn will be out to make history in the SEC's greatest rivalry on Saturday when the Tigers host No. 10 Alabama in a seismic showdown with far-reaching implications. Never in the Iron Bowl's expansive history has a top-10 Alabama team traveled to face an unranked Auburn team inside Jordan-Hare Stadium and lost. If that changes in 2025, the fallout will be dire for Alabama. The Crimson Tide looked like a near-lock to make the College Football Playoff just two weeks ago. Then came a loss to Oklahoma, which has eliminated Bama's margin for error as it heads into a venue where things are never easy. With a win, Alabama (9-2, 6-1 SEC) could reach the SEC Championship Game and cement its status as a CFP team.However, a loss would leave second-year coach Kalen DeBoer with consecutive nine-win regular seasons and an 0-for-2 mark on reaching the 12-team playoff. Furor would intensify to an uncomfortable degree. The Crimson Tide enter as just 6-point favorites against their hated in-state foe, despite the fact that Auburn is 5-6 (1-6) and playing under interim coach D.J. Durkin.But strange things tend to happen when this game is contested on The Plains. The Crimson Tide's last two wins at Auburn in 2023 and 2021 came by a combined total of five points against Tigers teams that finished just 6-7. Given the stakes and the narrow line, it would be no surprise if we're in for another thriller in 2025.\n  Alabama vs. Auburn: Need to know  Auburn's improved offense: Auburn played its best offensive game of the season in its first game following Hugh Freeze's firing. Though the Tigers fell 45-38 in overtime at Vanderbilt, they showed a new and more exciting gear with Ashton Daniels unleashed as the starting quarterback and offensive coordinator Derrick Nix calling the plays. Daniels rested in last week's win over Mercer to help preserve his redshirt year, but he'll be in the lineup against the Crimson Tide. Another beneficiary of Auburn's offensive progression following Freeze's firing has been receiver Cam Coleman. The star sophomore made 10 catches for 143 yards and a touchdown against Vandy.Ty Simpson's turnovers: After thriving as a clutch playmaker and fierce protector of the football during an eight-game winning streak, Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson has picked up a case of the \"whoopsie daisies\" as of late. He was intercepted and fumbled in the Crimson Tide's loss to Oklahoma and was also picked off twice in the first half of last week's win over Eastern Illinois. While Simpson's play unquestionably helped elevate Alabama after a stunning Week 1 loss at Florida State, his recent regression is a concern heading into the Iron Bowl. For better or worse, the verdict on his redshirt junior season will be rendered largely based on his performance against Auburn.Only once before: It's never happened inside Jordan-Hare Stadium before, but there is one example from this rivalry's illustrious history of a top-10 Alabama team losing to an unranked Auburn squad. It came in 2002, when a 7-4 Auburn team knocked off No. 9 Alabama 17-7 during Dennis Franchione's second and final season as coach. Bama was serving a postseason ban that year, which only magnified the Auburn game's significance as the barometer of a successful season. The Tigers jumped out to a 17-0 halftime lead and ended Alabama's five-game winning streak.\n  Where to watch Alabama vs. Auburn live  Date: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Location: Jordan-Hare Stadium -- Auburn, Alabama  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Auburn prediction, picks  \nAlabama quarterback Ty Simpson has been a bit rickety as of late, but he's successfully navigated a number of tense situations involving serious game pressure and won't be rattled by this environment. Auburn's quarterback group doesn't bring the same winning pedigree, and while the Tigers are a threat to run the football, Bama's run defense has improved significantly in the season's second half. The Tigers will be able to move the football some, but the Crimson Tide are masters of creating big turnovers and coming up with clutch stops. If Simpson returns to form, Alabama can gain second-half separation.

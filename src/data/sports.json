    "body": "\n        The New Orleans Saints (2-8) host the Atlanta Falcons (3-7) in an NFC South matchup on Sunday afternoon between two franchises more so with their eyes on next season. Both teams are significant longshots to make the postseason, even with Tampa Bay leading the division with just a 6-4 record. The Falcons have lost five straight games and turn to veteran Kirk Cousins after Michael Penix Jr. suffered a season-ending knee injury last week. The Saints are coming off a bye week following a 17-7 victory over the Panthers in rookie quarterback Tyler Shough's second start of the season. This is their first head-to-head matchup of the season.Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. ET from Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. According to the latest NFL odds, the Saints are favored by 2.5 points, while the over/under for total points scored is 39.5. The Saints are -132 money line favorites (risk $132 to win $100), while the Falcons are +112 underdogs. Click here to bet Falcons vs. Saints at FanDuel, where new users get $150 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Where to bet on Saints vs. FalconsBrandPromoPromo CodeDraftKingsBet $5, get $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 Months of NBA League PassJust click herebet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets instantly CBSBET365BetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSCaesarsBet $1, double your winnings your next 20 betsCBS20XFanDuelBet $5, get $150 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanaticsBet and get up to $2,000 in No Sweat Bets FanCash  CBSFANWhere to watch Falcons vs. Saints on SundayWhen: Sunday, Nov. 23Time: 4:25 p.m. ETTV: FOXFollow along: CBS Sports AppSaints vs. Falcons betting previewOdds: Saints -2.5, over/under 39.5It's been a challenging week for Atlanta, which found out Michael Penix Jr. will miss the remainder of the season with a knee injury, and star wide receiver Drake London (knee) is out this week as well. Kirk Cousins will start, and the 37-year-old looked his age in his first start, completing 21 of 31 passes for 173 yards and no touchdowns in a 34-10 loss to the Dolphins in Week 8. Cousins has been a reliable starter for the majority of his NFL career, and the Falcons hope he has a few more of those performances left. Expectations weren't high for Kellen Moore in his first season as the New Orleans head coach, and although the Saints only have two victories, three of their eight losses have come in one-score contests, so they haven't been totally outclassed. The Saints are favored for just the second time this season, and the only other time they were favored, New Orleans defeated the Giants, 26-14, on their home field. They'll seek a similar result on Sunday, coming off just their second win of the season before a bye week.Model's Falcons vs. Saints score prediction, picksThe SportsLine Projection Model knows that the Falcons will rely on one of the best running back tandems in Bijan Robinson and Tyler Allgeier, as the Falcons are 13th in the NFL in yards per rush (4.5). It also knows the Saints have a big-play receiver in Chris Olave, who had 104 yards and a touchdown in his last game against the Panthers and is 15th in the NFL at 664 receiving yards. The model has New Orleans winning by one point, but its top pick is the Over (39.5), as it is projecting 47 total points. Falcons vs. Saints score prediction: Saints 24, Falcons 23Falcons vs. Saints SGPOver 40.5 (-105)Tyler Shough Over 201.5 passing yards (-114)Tyler Shough Over 0.5 interceptions (-117)Final odds: +405 (wager $100 to win $405)Click here to bet Saints vs. Falcons at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Want more Week 12 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for New Orleans Saints vs. Atlanta Falcons.

That leaves just three teams vying for two spots in the Dec. 6 ACC Championship in Charlotte: No. 19 Virginia, Pittsburgh and SMU.The problem in the playoff discussion?

And with the stipulation five of those bids are given as auto-conference champions, a potentially unranked winner of the ACC isn't going to have much of a say.\nKeep an eye on Tuesday night's rankings. Where SMU or Pittsburgh land in relation to various Group of Five options is extremely important moving forward.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Oregon Ducks moved a major step closer to another trip to the College Football Playoff on Saturday with an impressive 42-27 home win over No. 15 USC in the biggest game of the Week 13 schedule. That win improved them to 10-1 on the season and makes next week's game at Washington a \"win and in\" situation for the Ducks, whether they make the Big Ten title game or not. In his postgame press conference, Oregon coach Dan Lanning was asked what he hopes the College Football Playoff committee takes away from the Ducks' play this season, and he couldn't help but take a swipe at the SEC, where many of the top contenders were playing Sun Belt, Conference USA or FCS opponents.\"We just played a really good team and we beat them,\" Lanning said. \"A lot of times we play really good teams that become unranked all of a sudden, that's not our fault, right -- maybe it is our fault -- but all that we're worried about is playing the teams we play and doing the job we need to do and we did that job today. I think that the proof's in the pudding. We played a good team and we beat them. All we can do next week is try and do the same thing. \n\"This conference is a really good conference. It's competitive. We didn't play Chattanooga State today, like some other places. We competed. So with that being said, it's tough playing nine conference games. It's tough playing in this league, and we got to take advantage of playing a good team today and attacking that.\"First off, UT Chattanooga is the only college football program in Chattanooga (Chattanooga State does exist but doesn't have a football program) and, as Dan Mullen will tell you, they're an excellent football team. Second, I think the response from most SEC programs would be to ask what the difference is between opening your season with an FCS opponent, as Oregon did, and playing one at the end of it -- to Oregon's credit, they did face a good FCS team in Montana State.What Lanning's doing is understandable though, as so much gets made of the challenge of the SEC week-to-week, while the Big Ten doesn't get the same respect. A lot of that comes down to the fact that the bottom of the Big Ten looks considerably worse than the top of it, but there's certainly an argument to be made that the middle class of the Big Ten doesn't get the respect they deserve relative to similar programs in the SEC. \nThat's the more salient point in Lanning's answer here, but stumping for the Big Ten being better top to bottom than it's been credited for wouldn't grab headlines in the same way as the Chattanooga State swipe. Lanning is just doing his part to stump for his team to get the best possible seeding, for whatever that's worth for a team that almost assuredly won't be in the top 4, and couldn't resist a chance at a drive-by on his SEC rivals on a week where his team got to enjoy the spotlight mostly to themselves. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 12 NFL odds feature four games with a spread of a field goal or less, while three contests have a double-digit NFL line. Amongst the former are Steelers vs. Bears (-2.5), with Aaron Rodgers (wrist) listed as questionable, and Jaguars vs. Cardinals (+2.5), while double-digit favorites to place Week 12 NFL bets include Seattle (-12.5) versus Tennessee and Detroit (-12.5) versus the Giants. A team that isn't even over .500, however, is the biggest favorite on the Week 12 NFL schedule. Baltimore has won four straight to get back into the playoff picture, and they'll host the Jets on Sunday. The Ravens are at -13.5 to use in Week 12 NFL picks, and while double-digit favorites are 10-1 straight up this season, they are just 6-5 ATS. One of those games whose spread falls in between the aforementioned extremes is Chiefs vs. Colts, which has another .500 team in Kansas City as 3.5-point favorites over an 8-2 Colts squad coming off a bye. All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your initial $5 bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Arizona is 6-1 ATS versus AFC opponents since 2024, which is the second-best spread record for any team in non-conference matchups. Meanwhile, the Jags are just 1-4 ATS this year outside of Jacksonville, and the takeaways that fueled their early success have nearly dried up. The Jaguars averaged 3.3 takeaways over their first four games but have averaged just 0.8 turnovers forced per game over their last six. Thus, extra offensive possessions for Arizona allow it to take advantage of the Jags' 26th-ranked passing defense, as Jacoby Brissett is projected to have more yards and touchdowns than Trevor Lawrence. With that, the Cardinals cover in over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nAnother one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Ravens (-13.5, 44.5) cover versus the Jets in well over 50% of simulations. New York is coming off a mini-bye, having played last Thursday, but there's no spread advantage with this rest edge. The Jets are 3-11-1 ATS over their last 15 games when they have a rest advantage over their opponent. Their Sunday opponent, Baltimore, has recently looked like the team most expected them to be all season as the Ravens have allowed just 14.8 points over their last five games. That includes a pair of games versus top-10 scoring offenses, but the team doesn't have to worry about seeing that with the Jets, who rank dead last in passing offense and 25th in scoring. Baltimore covers with points to spare, and the model also says the Over hits in over 70% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here.\nHow to make Week 12 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed five teams projected to win by double-digits, potentially giving you a huge payday by playing the alternate lines. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine.So what Week 12 NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which five teams should you lock in now?

    "body": "\n        All Elite Wrestling returns with its penultimate pay-per-view of the year, AEW Full Gear. \"Hangman\" Adam Page and Samoa Joe run back their world championship match from WrestleDream, but this time, inside a steel cage. \"Hangman\" beat Joe for the first time last month after multiple failed attempts of the year. Their hostilities only escalated after Joe and his faction, The Opps, attacked \"Hangman\" post-match. On Saturday, Page gets Joe to himself in a steel cage.Full Gear will also crown the inaugural National champion, a title intended to be defended in promotions beyond just AEW. Bobby Lashley and Shelton Benjamin, Hurt Syndicate teammates, will be the first participants in the Casino Gauntlet match. The innovative match starts with two participants. New entrants join the fray at timed intervals; however, the match can end by pinfall or submission at any time. In theory, the match could end with two or 21 participants in the ring. Other notable stars wrestling at Full Gear include TBS champion Mercedes Mone, former world champions Jon Moxley and Kenny Omega, and AEW stalwart Darby Allin. Omega, considered one of the best wrestlers in the world who never competed in WWE, admits he has been thinking about when he will retire.\n\"I've been thinking a lot about when that timing would be. Another important thing for me is, when I finally do leave, whenever that may be, and this might sound odd, I don't want people to be sad,\" Omega told CBS Sports. \"In fact, the best-case scenario for me is that they don't realize I'm gone at all. I'd love to have the peace of mind that the company has built enough stars so that their star is shining bright enough to distract from me stepping away from the scene. That would make me most happy.\"Below is how you can catch all the action on Saturday night.\nWatch 2025 AEW Full GearDate: Nov. 22Location: Prudential Center -- Newark, New JerseyStart time: 8 p.m. ETWatch live: HBO Max, Prime Video, PPV.com, YouTube, and Fubo | Price: $49.992025 AEW Full Gear match cardAEW World Championship -- \"Hangman\" Adam Page (c) vs. Samoa Joe (Steel cage match)Jox Moxley vs. Kyle O'Reilly (No Holds Barred match)AEW Women's World Championship -- Kris Statlander (c) vs. Mercedes Mone Kenny Omega & Jurassic Express (\"Jungle\" Jack Perry &  Luchasaurus) vs. The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson & Nick Jackson) &  Josh Alexander  AEW Women's Tag Team Championship -- Babes of Wrath (Willow & Harley Cameron) vs. Sisters of Sin (Julia Hart & Skye Blue) vs. Timeless Love Bombs (\"Timeless\" Toni Storm & Mina Shirakawa) vs. Megan Bayne & Marina ShafirDarby Allin vs. PacTNT Championship -- Kyle Fletcher (c) vs. Mark Briscoe (No Disqualification match)*National Championship -- Bobby Lashley vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Ricochet vs. Kevin Knight vs. \"Speedball\" Mike Bailey vs. More TBA (Casino Gauntlet match)AEW Tag Team Championships -- Brodido (Bandido & Brody King) (c) vs. FTR (Cash Wheeler & Dax Harwood)Hook & Eddie Kingston vs. WorkHorsemen (Anthony Henry vs. JD Drake)CMLL World Trios Championships -- El Sky Team (Mistico, Mascara Dorada & Neon) (c) vs. The Don Callis Family (Kazuchika Okada, Konosuke Takeshita & Hechicero)The Acclaimed (Max Caster & Anthony Bowens) vs. Bang Bang Gang (Austin Gunn & Juice Robinson) vs. Big Bill & Bryan Keith vs. The Outrunners (Truth Magnum & Turbo Floyd)Boom & Doom (\"Big Boom\" A.J. & Q.T.

    "body": "\n        Arch Manning completed something akin to the football version of hitting for the cycle in baseball on Saturday as No. 17 Texas throttled Arkansas 52-37. The Longhorns' redshirt sophomore quarterback scored as a passer, runner and receiver while totaling six touchdowns in what amounted to the best game of his career to date.Facing the woebegone Arkansas defense is exactly what Manning needed amid an up-and-down season that has seen Texas fall from a No. 1 preseason ranking to the outer fringes of the playoff conversation. Crushing a bad Razorbacks team will likely do little to increase Texas' chances of reaching the CFP as a three-loss team, but it may give Manning and his team an emotional lift.With unbeaten No. 3 Texas A&M coming to town next week, the Longhorns still have plenty to play for. Taking down the highly ranked Aggies would mark a meaningful rivalry win and breathe a sliver of life into Texas' slim CFP hopes. Manning concluded his day against the Razorbacks with a career-high 389 yards on 18 of 30 passing.\nManning was one of Week 13's big winners from a consequential day of action that brought us one step closer to seeing conference championship game matchups set. Here's the full rundown of winners and losers.\nWinner: Vanderbilt reaches milestoneVanderbilt tied a program record with its ninth victory as the No. 14 Commodores took down Kentucky 45-17. With one more victory, Vandy will become the final Power Four program to reach 10 wins in a season for the first time. But that's only the beginning of the Commodores' aspirations. With a win at Tennessee next week, Vanderbilt would head into Selection Sunday at 10-2 record and a realistic chance at CFP inclusion. For a program that went 9-36 between 2020 and 2023, the turnaround has been historically impressive. Oh, and Diego Pavia's Heisman chances are looking up after the star quarterback totaled more than 500 yards and six touchdowns.\nLoser: Kansas State blows a marquee opportunityIt's been a frustrating season for Kansas State, but it appeared the Wildcats were closing in on a marquee win at No. 12 Utah. Then came a stunning collapse that encapsulated the agony the Wildcats have dealt with throughout a season of unmet expectations. Utah rallied back from a 10-point deficit in the game's closing stages for a stunning 51-47 victory behind the wheels of quarterback Devon Dampier. His 59-yard scamper on a decisive 4th-and-1 play set up the go-ahead touchdown that lifted the Utes to an improbable win. \nWinner: Oregon nears CFP lock statusA rash of offensive injuries only worsened for No. 7 Oregon, leaving the Ducks playing three backup offensive linemen at one point. But the shifting unit got the job done in a critical 42-27 win over No. 15 USC. The game's biggest highlight came on special teams, as Malik Benson's 85-yard punt return with 9:58 left in the second quarter put the Ducks ahead for good. Benson also made four catches for 67 yards as Oregon navigated a top-15 showdown without the top three receivers on its depth chart.\nWinner: Notre Dame looks like a title contenderNotre Dame apparently got the memo that it may need to accumulate style points to impress the College Football Playoff selection committee. The Fighting Irish scored on offense, defense and special teams in the first quarter alone while beating Syracuse to a pulp. The final score was 70-7, but the Fighting Irish realistically could have approached 100 in this game if they'd wanted to. The Orange were a wholly inept opponent -- they started a walk-on from the lacrosse team at quarterback -- but this was nevertheless an impressive showing from an Irish team with something to prove.\nLoser: Louisville's collapse worsensIt's hard to believe that Louisville was regarded as an ACC title contender and CFP candidate just a few weeks ago. The Cardinals, who were once 7-1 and No. 15 in the CFP Rankings, have now dropped three straight after taking a 38-6 loss at SMU. The Cards started redshirt freshman Deuce Adams at quarterback amid a foot injury to Miller Moss. But any hope of a QB change bringing a spark to the passing game quickly dissipated as Louisville produced a paltry 228 total yards. SMU also had its way offensively as Kevin Jennings threw for 303 yards and three touchdowns without an interception.\nWinner: Oklahoma's defense delivers againOklahoma's defense delivered once again, as the No. 8 Sooners stayed on track with a suffocating 17-6 win over No. 22 Missouri. The visiting Tigers had a multitude of chances, reaching OU territory six times. However, those six forays across the 50 resulted in just six points. OU picked off Mizzou quarterback Beau Pribula twice in the second half and generated eight tackles for loss for the game. It marked the second week in a row that Oklahoma has defeated a ranked opponent while producing less than 300 yards of offense. \nLoser: Kansas is fading fastKansas started 4-2 and looked destined to return to a bowl game. But after falling 38-14 at Iowa State, the Jayhawks have dropped four of their last five, and closing against No. 13 Utah bodes poorly for KU's hopes of reaching six wins. So does the defense's inability to get off the field. The Cyclones converted 9 of 16 third downs and 4 of 5 fourth downs while nearly doubling up KU in time of possession. Kansas fell behind 17-0 early. It finally found some offensive momentum, but KU couldn't rally all the way back against an Iowa State offense that stayed one step ahead all game.\nWinner: Shaky JMU keeps CFP hopes aliveJames Madison is still holding out hope that it could be one of the five highest-ranked conference champions and earn a spot to the College Football Playoff. But those hopes nearly went up in smoke on Saturday before the Dukes rallied for a 24-20 win over Washington State. Wayne Knight's 58-yard touchdown run with 6:24 remaining put JMU ahead 24-20. The Dukes then made a defensive stand to emerge with a close win over a Cougars team that also pushed CFP candidates Virginia and Ole Miss to the brink in close losses this season.\nLoser: North Carolina's bowl dreams die painfullyBill Belichick's debut campaign in college football won't end in a bowl appearance after North Carolina fell to 4-7 with a dramatic 32-25 loss to rival Duke. The Blue Devils pulled off a fake field goal while trailing by a point with under three minutes remaining and parlayed the bold call into a touchdown and 2-point conversion. It was a painful way to lose for the Tar Heels, who have become accustomed to pain during what was supposed to be a celebratory season. Hiring Belichick was supposed to signal that North Carolina was serious about football. Instead, it resulted in the program failing to reach the postseason for the first time since 2018.\nWinner: Good Carson Beck is backMiami quarterback Carson Beck has thrown seven touchdowns without an interception over his past two games to get back on track and keep the No. 13 Hurricanes in the playoff hunt. In Saturday's 34-17 win at Virginia Tech, he totaled 320 yards and four touchdowns. His favorite target was the stud freshman Malachi Toney, who tallied career highs in catches (12) and receiving yards (146). This is the sort of play the 'Canes became accustomed to from Beck during a 5-0 start against a challenging schedule.\nLoser: Baylor falls apartBaylor suffered an epic meltdown in the second half of a 41-17 loss at Arizona. The Bears led 17-14 at the break but were outscored 27-0 the rest of the way. A trio of second-half turnovers doomed Baylor's chances and left it needing a win over Houston next week to reach bowl eligibility. The school has already signaled that coach Dave Aranda will return for a seventh season, but after four losses over the past five games, it's hard to imagine anyone feels great about that decision.\nWinner: Tennessee ends Swampy streakNo. 20 Tennessee's back was against the wall as it crushed Florida 31-11. Because of changes to the SEC's scheduling structure, the Volunteers won't be returning to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium until 2029. Thus, if anyone on the current roster wanted to be part of the team that ended the Volunteers' 10-game road losing streak against the Gators, they needed to get it done Saturday night. The Vols left no doubt as they jumped on their rival early and built a 31-0 lead. At 8-3 (4-3 SEC), Tennessee's hopes of a return to the CFP are over, but winning in the Swamp for the first time since 2003 marked a meaningful accomplishment from a season otherwise defined by the agony of close losses to Georgia and Oklahoma.\nLoser: Georgia Tech squanders a chanceNo. 16 Georgia Tech squandered its chance to reach the ACC Championship Game for the first time since 2014 as it was stunned at home by Pitt 42-28. What should have been a celebratory evening inside Bobby Dodd Stadium quickly turned into a nightmare as the Panthers jumped out to a 28-0 lead. Following the dominant early barrage, Pitt held on as the Yellow Jackets tried in vain to rally. Moments of opportunity like this are rare at Georgia Tech, and next week's rivalry showdown presents another huge moment of potential glory. But it's hard not to feel like this team let a golden ACC opportunity slip through its fingers during a rare year in which both Clemson and Florida State were down.\nLoser: Illinois embarrasses itselfNo. 21 Illinois put forth an embarrassing effort in a 27-10 road loss against one of the worst Wisconsin teams in a generation. The good news for the Illini is that they weren't the only people to embarrass themselves at Camp Randall Stadium. Wisconsin students rushing the field made for a cringe-worthy scene. Badgers (4-7, 2-6 Big Ten) also rushed for a win over Wisconsin earlier this month. That was at least somewhat understandable since it marked the first victory against a Power Four opponent in over a year. But has Wisconsin really sunken so low that beating a barely ranked Illinois team warrants rushing the field?\nWinner: BYU surges onward No. 11 BYU kept its Big 12 title aspirations on track and added a glimmer of hope for its at-large playoff consideration with a 26-14 win at Cincinnati. LJ Martin led the way with 222 yards rushing and two touchdowns for the Cougars (10-1, 7-1 Big 12), who are likely destined for a Big 12 title game rematch with Texas Tech. The Red Raiders won the first meeting in dominant fashion during Week 12. But the Cougars can secure a high-stakes rematch if they handle business against UCF next week.\n            ",

    "body": "\nTwo star-studded teams in the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC will meet in San Jose for the NWSL Championship, a competitive match likely in store as each side chases their second league title, but the big question looms -- will Trinity Rodman play?The pair took contrasting roads to the NWSL Championship, the No. 2 seed Spirit advancing as the favorites in their matchups while Gotham played spoiler as the No. 8 seed, eliminating the runaway NWSL Shield winners in the Kansas City Current and last year's champions Orlando Pride. To describe this as a David vs. Goliath-type game would be a misnomer, though, Gotham have been inconsistent, but they won the Championship just two years ago and boast an MVP nominee in Esther Gonzalez.While Gonzalez and new Gotham recruict Jaedyn Shaw headline Juan Carlos Amoros' team, the attention will also be squarely on the Spirit's Rodman. She returned from an MCL sprain in a very brief cameo in the Spirit's 2-0 win over the Portland Thorns last week, her exact status unclear, but the latest is that she was not on the official injury report and her coach Adrian Gonzalez says she is 'available.' If there is any game she could play, though, it just might be one where there's a trophy on the line – in what could be her final NWSL game, her contract expiring upon the conclusion of the season.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8:19 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Live updates: Spirit vs. GothamProjected lineupsWashington Spirit: Aubrey Kingsbury, Rosemonde Kouassi, Esme Morgan, Rebeca Bernal, Tara McKeown, Kate Weisner, Hal Hershfelt, Leicy Santos, Croix Bethune, Trinity Rodman, Gift MondayRodman's availability will be the big talking point on Saturday, in large part because the Spirit are a different team when she is on the field. They have won nine of the 16 games she has played this season and posted a +15 goal differential along the way, while the number of wins dwindles to four in 11 games she did not play with a goal differential of -3. If Rodman cannot start, though, Italy international Sofia Cantore could fill in after starting against the Thorns while the Spirit's attacking plans will run through Gift Monday regardless, the Nigerian scoring 10 goals so far this season.Gotham FC: Ann-Katrin Berger, Bruninha, Emily Sonnett, Jess Carter, Lily Reale, Jaelin Howell, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Gabi Portillo, Midge Purce, Esther GonzalezGotham's defensive stability has kept them afloat in a year of inconsistent attacking output, though not from a lack of effort on Gonzalez's part. The Spain international has 13 goals this season, just two behind MVp winner Temwa Chawinga, and Shaw's scintillating form has helped Gotham make up some of the attacking deficit left behind after Yazmeen Ryan and Lynn Biyendolo's departures in the offseason. Rose Lavelle is also in strong form, connecting expertly with international teammate Shaw to revive Gotham's offense at just the right time.PredictionThere is motivation and narrative to support either team's argument, setting up for a closely-contested Championship game – and perhaps a spicy one, if last year's semifinal in which the Spirit ousted Gotham on penalty kicks is anything to go by. This one will likely come down to a moment of brilliance from a star and there is no one who is more in-form than Shaw. She has two goals and an assist during Gotham's postseason run, a contribution on each and every goal they have scored in the playoffs so far. She has helped them pull off two upsets in a row, a third not exactly out of reach for a roster just as stacked as the one they will face. Pick: Washington Spirit 1, Gotham FC 2 (after extra time)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In what amounted to a College Football Playoff elimination game between two top-15 titans in the Big Ten, No. 7 Oregon kept its conference championship and national title hopes alive Saturday with a spirited 42-27 win over No. 15 USC.The Ducks (9-2) need a win at Washington and a Michigan victory over Ohio State next week to reach the Big Ten Championship Game for the second straight season as the league's reigning champion.The loss for the Trojans (8-3) eliminates the Trojans team from various league title scenarios and now, the race will be decided during rivalry weekend with unbeatens Ohio State and Indiana leading the way ahead of Oregon and Michigan, a 45-20 winner at Maryland.Oregon never trailed following Malik Benson's 85-yard punt return midway through the second quarter and put it away with Noah Whittington's touchdown run with 5:30 to play after USC had cut a two-score deficit to eight points on Jayden Maiva's to Lake McRee in the final frame.\nBefore getting to what Oregon's victory means in the overall playoff picture, here's a glance at how updated Big Ten Championship scenarios coming out of Week 12:Big Ten tiebreakers, explained The tied teams will be compared based on head-to-head matchups during the regular season.The tied teams will be compared based on record against all common conference opponents.The tied teams will be compared based on record against common opponents with the best conference record and proceeding through the common conference opponents based on their order of finish within the conference standings. The tied teams will be compared based on the best cumulative conference winning percentage of all conference opponents.The representative will be chosen based on the highest ranking by SportSource Analytics (team Rating Score metric) following the regular season.The representative will be chosen by random draw among the tied teams conducted by the commissioner or designee.Big Ten Championship scenarios after Oregon's winIf Oregon beats Washington next weekend and Michigan beats Ohio State, the Ducks are in the title game.If Michigan beats Ohio State and Washington beats Oregon, the Wolverines are in the title game.If Ohio State beats Michigan, the Buckeyes are in the title game.If Indiana beats Purdue, the Hoosiers are in the title game.Michigan has won four straight over the Buckeyes, but an upset of top-ranked Ohio State next week would be the most improbable victory in the current stretch of success.For the Ducks to secure an opening-round home game, they're going to need to beat Washington on the road during rivalry weekend. A loss for Oregon and a 10-2 finish would put them team in a logjam with several other at-large, 10-win teams and would risk the Ducks falling behind two-loss Oklahoma and Notre Dame given the hot streak's each has shown in the final month.\nOklahoma took out No. 22 Missouri on Saturday for its third straight quality victory, while the Fighting Irish walloped Syracuse, 70-7, and have Stanford left.In CBS Sports' latest playoff bracket projection, Oregon was slotted as the 8-seed hosting No. 9 Oklahoma in December. However, should Oregon, Oklahoma and Notre Dame win out, we're expecting the Ducks to move to No. 6 in the final bracket replacing Ole Miss, which could slide should Lane Kiffin bolt to LSU.Committee chair Hunter Yurachek explained after the third playoff rankings why the Ducks were one spot ahead of the Sooners.\n\"Oregon, while their strength of schedule metric may not be as strong as an Oklahoma, we felt like they are a very strong team on both sides of the ball,\" Yurachek said. \"Offensively and defensively, they rank in the top 10 of most of the statistical categories that we use, in comparison to other teams.\"Yurachek noted Oregon's recent ranked win at Iowa and said the committee still views the victory at Penn State in September as a quality win.\"I know Penn State is not the same Penn State we expected them to be this year,\" Yurachek said. \"Still, it's a very challenging place to play as evidenced by Indiana having to have a last-second touchdown to win there a couple weeks ago. So there was significant discussion about that, but Oregon at 9-1 stayed one spot ahead of Oklahoma.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 12 has arrived for NFL DFS players, and there are three matchups on the Sunday 'main slate' that feature an over/under of 50 points or higher. Lions vs. Giants, Colts vs. Chiefs and Patriots vs. Bengals will all be potential sources of major offense. NFL DFS lineups won't feature Ja'Marr Chase (suspension), Joe Burrow (toe) or Jaxson Dart (concussion) this week, but big names like Amon-Ra St. Brown, Drake Maye and Patrick Mahomes are all in play. Which NFL DFS picks from those matchups should you target, and are there players from potentially lower-scoring games like Seahawks vs. Titans or Raiders vs. Browns who should factor into your NFL DFS strategy? Before making any NFL DFS picks for Week 12, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy, and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure. New users can also target the latest Underdog promo code, good for $100 in bonus entries when you play $5 with the promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings.

This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings, including. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.Now, McClure has turned his attention to Week 12's Sunday main slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins + 3 months of NBA League Pass:Top NFL DFS picks for Week 12Part of McClure's NFL DFS strategy for the Week 12 main slate is rostering Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce at $5,000 on DraftKings and $6,000 on FanDuel. Generally the most expensive tight end in the player pool in recent years, Kelce is now the third-most expensive TE option on the main slate for both sites as his overall production has slipped. McClure, however, is encouraged by his massive numbers last week that included season highs in targets (13), receptions (9) and yards (91). The Colts rank 30th in the league in points given up to opposing Fantasy tight ends, opening the door for a massive day for Kelce in what could be a high-scoring game. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another one of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Packers running back Emanuel Wilson ($6,500 on FanDuel, $5,300 on DraftKings), who could see a big workload with Josh Jacobs (knee) listed as questionable. Wilson, a third-year pro out of Fort Valley State, did a nice job in relief last week with 49 scrimmage yards and a score. He was also effective against the Steelers last month in the other game he saw extensive action, piling up 87 scrimmage yards. Minnesota has given up the ninth-most rushing yards to opposing backs this year and the Vikings might not have starting edge Jonathan Greenard (shoulder, questionable). See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for Week 12McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

    "body": "\n        SAN JOSE, CALIF. --  In a match an entire year in the making, it was a moment of brilliance that separated Gotham FC from Washington Spirit in the 2025 NWSL Championship final, thanks to veteran midfielder Rose Lavelle. The two teams have played each other more times (45) than any other team in NWSL history, surpassing the famed Pacific Northwest rivalry between the Portland Thorns and the Seattle Reign. In recent years, the matches have been more tightly contested, and with added meetings outside of the league during the 2025 Concacaf W Champions Cup, it was only natural that the 2025 NWSL Championship felt as cagey as it did at times. It took a moment of brilliance by Lavelle late in the game for Gotham to finally capitalize on the possession they happened to retain while the Spirit were trying to manage getting out of an injury scenario. Spirit midfielder Hal Hershfelt was getting treatment on the sidelines for several minutes, and eventually came back into the match, but Gotham fullback Brunihna took advantage of the wide spaces, and Lavelle handled the rest.\n\"I think it was like, maybe the one moment I had in the game to step up. And I keep saying I think Bruninha did the heavy lifting on that, but yeah, it was a great ball across the box, and luckily I was able to get there to finish. But yeah, it was fun,\" Lavelle said about her game-winning goal.\nThis is Gotham FC's second NWSL Championship title in the last three years, though they haven't made it easy on themselves. The club finished the 2025 regular season in eighth place, falling to the last available playoff spot. But Gotham FC had been in this scenario before in 2023 and were familiar with running a playoff gauntlet all the way to a podium finish. This is a first-time experience, though, for plenty of players in 2025, including Lavelle, who signed with the team in 2024 in a monster offseason for the club.\"I definitely wouldn't have thought, like three years ago, that I'd be on Gotham playing in a final. I wouldn't have anticipated that. But I think, nonetheless, it's been a really exciting, fun journey. Being a part of the New York-New Jersey sports market has been so fun and special. So having the opportunity to potentially bring another title back to the city would be really, really cool in terms of [my] career,\" Lavelle said in the days leading up to the NWSL Championship.Lavelle is one of the league's most familiar faces. A player whose singular talent has long been celebrated, a former No. 1 pick in the NWSL Draft, an event roster-building mechanism that no longer exists. She's played for four different clubs before turning 30, and at one point even had to be selected in a dispersal draft, because the former club that drafted her, the Boston Breakers, folded.\nNow, despite winning FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic gold medals, the long-time NWSL player was back in the NWSL Championship final, this time playing for the team that she lost against in 2023.\"I keep saying, I think we all know that we like underperformed, especially at the end of the season. I think that was not the end that we wanted to have. So, I think going into this season, like we just were so confident in the group that we had. We know we have a lot of talent, and so I think we really leaned on that this playoff series, and I think that's what we saw, and that's what ended up helping us win,\" Lavelle said after the match. The creative, quick-thinking, dribbling menace has often glided through plenty of midfield traffic. She often just needs a few touches to find the open lane or take the quick shot. She's produced on the biggest stages in her career, and yet, an NWSL Championship has eluded her. That's no longer the case, and the title win has an added sense of accomplishment due to its difficulty. \n\"I feel like this is like, this is like, what you play for. This season is like, so long and hard, but then you get to these moments, and it's like this is the fun part. It's win, lose, or go home. So, I think we're all just like, fighting for each other and amped up playing every single day. It's a heightened sense of excitement. I mean, technically, I like to think every game should be the same, and you go into every game feeling the same, but I definitely think the NWSL Playoffs is like a whole different beast.\"The NWSL postseason is a different beast. NWSL players often refer to it as a new season or series to get through. This postseason has put Lavelle in the spotlight again, especially whenever Gotham finds themselves in tricky game situations. Throughout the regular season and the playoffs, there have been times when their attack has stagnated, and the path to the goal seemed blocked. But it is in these moments that Lavelle's quality becomes most vital, and where she's found the most growth.\"Oh my gosh, I think it's just so special. I keep saying like this was such a roller coaster of a season for us. We had injuries, we had a really daunting schedule with the amount of games that we were playing. The travel. I think just like the way that every single individual stepped up in the moments that they were asked to was so huge,\" she said.\n\"And so, I think I would say, you learn the most about yourself in the toughest moments. I think the adversity that we faced throughout the season really helped set us up to be prepared for this playoff push. I think that, that's really what set us up to, like, win in the end. We went through a lot of the season, we had seen it all, so, I don't think anything felt like new or unfamiliar going into this. And I think that that was a really big advantage for us going into the playoffs.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The Week 12 status of Green Bay Packers running back Josh Jacobs is very much up in the air after he suffered a knee injury against the New York Giants last weekend. Jacobs is dealing with tenderness in his knee, but he is expected to go through pre-game warmups before deciding whether he will play, according to ESPN and NFL Media.Jacobs didn't suffer any structural damage in his knee, but he has been battling soreness. With another key divisional game against the Detroit Lions coming up on Thanksgiving, the team will have to make sure Jacobs is healthy for the home stretch of the regular season.Earlier in the week, Jacobs was considered to be day-to-day. The veteran running back did not practice on Wednesday, but he got limited sessions in on Thursday and Friday. The Packers officially listed Jacobs as questionable on the final injury report of the week.Green Bay has leaned on Jacobs in the running game all season, and he's turned 169 carries into 648 yards and 11 touchdowns. When Jacobs is going, it takes pressure off a passing attack that has dealt with some key injuries to its receivers and tight ends.\nIf Jacobs can't go against the Vikings, backup Emmanuel Wilson will get the call. A third-year player, Wilson posted 40 yards and a touchdown after Jacobs exited the game last week.Regardless of which player leads the backfield on Sunday, the Green Bay offense will need a strong effort from its offense to score a massive win in the NFC North race. The Vikings are allowing just 317.5 yards per game, which ranks 11th in the NFL.\nThe Packers (6-3-1) are chasing the Chicago Bears for first place in the NFC North, and the Vikings (4-6) are trying to remain in the playoff hunt. This rivalry clash kicks off at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday afternoon.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        SAN JOSE -- The quest for the 2025 NWSL Championship enters its final day, the Washington Spirit face a pivotal question: Will soon-to-be free agent Trinity Rodman be fit to play?Spirit head coach Adrian Gonzalez offered the update fans have been waiting for: Rodman is \"going to be available and ready to compete.\"\"Trin is doing good. She's been, I think, improving so quick, pushing to be able to play,\" Gonzalez said. \"Fortunately, we could see her last week, playing some minutes, and she's doing great, so obviously she's going to be available and ready to compete.\"Rodman's season has been marred by injuries. A lingering back injury sidelined her for nearly four months and even sent her to Europe for treatment. Just 16 games after she returned, an MCL sprain kept her sidelined during the playoff push. She was bench-listed for both playoff games, making only a brief cameo in the final minute of Washington's semifinal win over Portland -- her first action in a month. Now, with the Spirit on the brink of a second NWSL Championship title in four years, her game-day availability could be the difference between glory and heartbreak.\nYou can catch the game Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.Rodman has dominated championship-week headlines -- not just because of her return from injury, but for what comes next. The 23-year-old enters the final game of the season as a potential free agent this offseason, with a report looming regarding a lucrative offer from USL Super League side D.C. Power, according to The Athletic. Her future has become a talking point across the league, has prompted commissioner Jessica Berman to emphasize that she and the league \"want Trinity in the NWSL and we will fight for her.\" That backdrop adds even more intrigue to her availability for Saturday's must-watch title clash.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 22 | Time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Rodman's return to the pitch this season has been anything but smooth, but the fact that Gonzalez declared her \"available and ready to compete\" is a significant upgrade, considering she was labeled as questionable entering the semifinal against Portland, where she subbed in as a late-game option and played a minute. \nWhile that's not a ringing endorsement of the ability to play lengthy minutes, it took Rodman one minute and four touches to record a definitive shot on goal. It shows again why she's such an important player, no matter the amount of time she can give to the Spirit in a high-stakes game like the NWSL Championship. Her availability isn't just a boost; it could be a potential game-changer.\n            ",

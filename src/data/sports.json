Patrick Mahomes had a season-high in passing yards (270), completion percentage (67.6%), yards per attempt (7.3) and touchdowns (four) in the victory, and it's no coincidence that came with Xavier Worthy back on the field. Kansas City has been without key players the majority of the season, and although Rashee Rice (suspension) remains out, Worthy's return from a shoulder injury provides a lift. Kansas City is still 2-2 this season though, behind the No. 8 scoring defense in the NFL (19.0 points per game allowed). The Jaguars are 3-1 this season, but Mahomes is 3-0 against the Jaguars, including the playoffs, with Trevor Lawrence starting. The model projects this trend to continue, with Kansas City covering the spread in 54% of simulations.</p><h2>Under 45.5 points</h2><p>The Jaguars and Chiefs both have top-10 scoring defenses this year, with Jacksonville ranking fifth at 18 ppg against and Kansas City eighth at 19 ppg. The Jaguars have held opponents to 10 points in two of four games this season, while Kansas City hasn't allowed more than 21 points in a game this season, despite facing strong offenses such as the Chargers, Ravens and Eagles. Lawrence is 30th in the NFL in passer rating this season and the wide receiver duo of Brian Thomas Jr. and Travis Hunter has been underwhelming early into the year. The Jaguars are 31st in the NFL in completion percentage. The Chiefs have gone Under in two of their last three games, and the model projects the Under to hit in 55% of simulations.</p><h3>Responsible gaming</h3><p>Responsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly. The top sportsbooks feature several tools and resources available on their apps and websites, including wager limits, voluntary self-exclusion options, and more. If you or someone you know is dealing with a gambling problem, please seek assistance from trained professionals such as the Problem Gambling Help Network at 1-800-GAMBLER.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>PHILADELPHIA -- For weeks, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/PHI/philadelphia-eagles/\">Philadelphia Eagles</a> have been searching for ways to unleash their passing game. That portion of the offense comes in spurts, as the star players have been desperate to make it go. </p><p>There's been frustration publicly and behind the scenes regarding the way the offense has looked -- a unit that ran the ball 54.4% of the time in the first four weeks of the season (which led the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a>) and averaged 23.8 offensive points per game.</p><p>Was there room to improve? Of course, but Philadelphia did a complete 180 on Sunday, calling 44 pass plays to just 11 runs for an insane 80% ratio. </p><p>Even more puzzling? The Eagles had a 17-3 lead with 13:23 left in the third quarter and still attempted to pass the ball, having 19 pass plays to just one play. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2185957/saquon-barkley/\">Saquon Barkley</a> had one carry and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2240246/jalen-hurts/\">Jalen Hurts</a> had the other, a run that was technically a designed pass he scrambled out of (hence the 19-1 ratio). </p>\n<p>\"At the end of the day, whether we ran the ball enough or not, we had an opportunity to win a football game, and we didn't,\" Barkley said. \"I really don't get caught up in, are we throwing the ball enough? Or are we running the ball enough? Can we win a football game? It's going to look different every single game.\"</p><p>The final result went as expected. The Eagles allowed 18 unanswered points in a 21-17 loss, as the offense ran 14 plays for 27 yards -- punting the ball all four times. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DEN/denver-broncos/\">Broncos</a> erased the 14-point deficit to emerge victorious, but the Eagles offense helped the cause by slinging the ball around and giving the ball right back to Denver. </p><p>There was a balance that wasn't practiced. The Eagles heard the public comments from their star pass catchers, and acted in accordance. The end result was a loss.</p>\n<p>\"I wouldn't say out of balance,\" said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2866975/devonta-smith/\">DeVonta Smith</a>. \"I think it was just based on what they were doing. They were playing a good bit of man and we like our chances when teams pay us man, but we have to be on the same page with certain things.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-week-5-overreactions-eagles-collapse-ravens-defense-emeka-egbuka-jets-cardinals/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Overreactions from Week 5 of NFL season: Eagles on heels of another collapse?

Brown</a></h2><p>The Eagles prioritized taking chances with the deep ball on Sunday, as Hurts threw eight passes of 25+ air yards. He connected on two of them, a 52-yard completion to Smith and a 46-yard touchdown to Barkley. </p><p>Hurts attempted as many passes of 25+ air yards against the Broncos as he had in his previous four games combined (eight). He finished 2 of 8 for 98 yards and a touchdown on those throws. </p>\n<p>None of those connects were to Brown, although it wasn't for lack of trying. With 3:43 left in the third quarter and the Eagles still holding that 14-point lead, Hurts went for the kill shot to Brown on a first-and-15. </p><p>Brown was open and didn't see the ball. Hurts may have double pumped before finding him downfield, but the pass was far outisde his reach. The miscommunication changed things for the Eagles, and not in a good way. </p><p>\"I didn't see it, so I can't tell you what he did,\" Brown said. \"From my point of view, we missed and that happens.</p>\n<p>\"I didn't think the ball was coming. When I looked up, I didn't see the ball. When I looked back I didn't see the ball. And then the ball was thrown. Like I said, we just missed.\"</p><p>The Eagles pass offense died after that. Hurts went 5 of 10 for 49 yards with a 64.2 passer rating. The Eagles threw the ball 13 times and ran it once the rest of the way, having 31 yards of offense to the Broncos' 190. </p><p>Hurts is 1 of 5 on throws of 25+ yards to Brown, having a 58.8 passer rating on those attempts. The connection between the two on deep balls has been off all year, which has led to the offensive inconsistencies. </p>\n<p>\"I won't give you my frustration,\" Brown said. \"But it's something to work on, something to continue to harp on and continue to have a sense of urgency of getting better in this area so we can improve and get some things rolling.\" </p><h2>Are Eagles on the same page?</h2><p>Smith mentioned several times the Eagles had a few plays they weren't on the same page, mentioning there where little things like not seeing a signal when Hurts is working with the protection. Per Smith, the Eagles aren't adjusting their routes or not seeing the signals fast enough.</p><p>\"Guys are thinking about a lot. Guys are looking around trying to dissect what coverage it is and things like that,\" Smith said. \"It can be a split second when you're looking up and look away to see if coverages are moving, guys are rotating, and he goes with a signal. </p>\n<p>\"Sometimes it's just the look of it. Sometimes you look up, he does it and you don't see it. Sometimes it's just us being on the same page with the signals.\"</p><p>Brown didn't share the same opinion.</p><p>\"That's something from those two (Smith and Hurts),\" Brown said. \"He said that so he probably thought that.\"</p><p>Brown hasn't been on the same page with this offense the majority of the season, even if he didn't agree with Smith's comments from Sunday. The Eagles have played 10 halves of football this season, and Brown has gone six of them with a catch or less. </p>\n<p>Brown is 57th in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> in receiving yards this season (194) and is averaging just 10.2 yards per catch. He's on pace for 660 yards receiving, averaging just 38.8 yards per game -- far from the three 1,000-yard seasons he's had in his first three years with the Eagles. </p><p>The Eagles don't appear to be on the same page in the passing game, even through it has looked strong at times. In the first half on Sunday, Hurts was 13 of 19 for 108 yards and a touchdown (106.9 rating).</p><p>But the problems remain with the deep passes. In the same half, Hurts was 1 of 5 for 52 yards on throws of 10+ air yards (52.4 rating). He completed just 25% of those passes of 10+ air yards in the loss -- and just 35.1% of those throws on the season. </p>\n<p>There's plenty to improve and a lot to fix. The Eagles listened to their players and opened up the offense -- having a result they only experienced once over the past calendar year. </p><p>Passing may not be in their best interest, but the Eagles appear set on getting it to work -- come hell or high water. </p><p>\"We gotta come out and not let whatever defense dictate what we're doing,\" Brown said. \"This loss sucks. Last week, I said we learn from winning and we learn from losing. So we have another opportunity to turn it around and get this thing going.\"</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Ahead of a dramatic battle for the final spot above the playoff cut line that saw two drivers literally go in opposite directions at the finish line, Shane van Gisbergen won the Bank of America Roval 400 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval to earn his fifth win of the season and the sixth of his NASCAR Cup Series career. After being eliminated from the playoffs in the Round of 16, SVG was able to put a period on his season as NASCAR's King of the Road, winning his fifth of the six Cup road course races this season and his fifth in a row.</p><p>While Van Gisbergen was able to outlast both Kyle Larson and Christopher Bell after a close and spirited race between the three drivers, the intrigue of Sunday's race wound up surrounding the cutoff for the Round of 8, which came down to defending Cup Series champion Joey Logano and Ross Chastain. </p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nascar/news/nascar-2025-race-schedule-results-complete-list-of-cup-series-race-dates-winners-tracks-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks</p>\n                <p>\n                    Steven Taranto                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"NASCAR playoffs 2025 race schedule, results: Complete list of Cup Series race dates, winners, tracks\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/06/453f29b0-8904-4579-8167-903cb125a451/thumbnail/270x152/7c5fbfaf8dd5806dc181a797f3277bd4/gettyimages-2239429823.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Thanks to scoring a good chunk of stage points, Chastain needed to finish only four spots ahead of Logano in order to advance to the next round, but his path towards doing so was complicated by a pair of self-inflicted wounds on pit road. He first cost himself track position by missing the turn at pit exit under caution at the end of stage 1, then put himself in an even worse position when he sped on pit road under green after accidentally leaving his pit box in the wrong gear.</p><p>Shortly after being passed by Chastain, Logano elected to come to pit road with 11 laps to go, giving him slightly fresher tires to try and run down enough cars on a three-stop strategy that he could gain enough points, combined with Chastain losing enough positions and points on older tires, that it would get him to the next round. It took until the final lap, but Logano's strategy would work out, as Denny Hamlin passed Chastain in turn 7 with one lap to go to flip the cut line back in the defending champion's favor via a tiebreaker that Logano held -- and then things got really interesting.</p>\n<p>In a desperation move in the final corner, Chastain lunged into the frontstretch chicane from well back of Hamlin to try and move him out of the way, but ended up spinning himself out along with Hamlin. Chastain threw his car into reverse and backed across the finish line, but by that point it was too late: Logano drove past the incident to finish 20th, which was enough to put him in the Round of 8 while Chastain, along with Tyler Reddick, Bubba Wallace and Austin Cindric, were all eliminated from playoff contention.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone was telling me how close it was gonna be there,\" Logano told USA. \"I knew I was within a point there, and I knew we were gonna be tied there at the end and Ross was gonna do whatever he had to do to make it happen. Just wasn't quite fast enough today with our car, but overall -- man, that's the drama of the playoffs, right? If you want drama, the playoffs bring it every time. What an entertaining finish there for it to come down to basically a tie at the end there before the wreck.</p><p>\"Proud of (crew chief) Paul Wolfe, he made some really hard calls today, three-stopping at the end there. Kind of an audible because our falloff was a little bit too much. Making that call there at the end was ultimately what kept us in the game with just a few left. That was a championship performance from the team. Wish I was a little faster, but overall I couldn't be more proud of the team. We've still got a shot.\"</p><p>Logano will begin the Round of 8 in the deepest points hole of any playoff contender, as he faces a 24-point deficit to the cut line to try and make the Championship 4. But considering his propensity to win in the Round of 8 even in the face of long odds, Logano's presence in the penultimate round of the playoffs is surely terrifying for the rest of the field trying to keep the driver of the No. 22 Ford from his third Cup title in four years.</p>\n<p>Denny Hamlin (+8), Ryan Blaney (+6), Kyle Larson and William Byron (+4) will all begin the next round on the plus side of the cut line to try and be among the four drivers who will race for the Cup championship next month at Phoenix. Christopher Bell (-4), Chase Briscoe and Chase Elliott (-14), and Logano (-24) will all try and avoid the final round of eliminations beginning next week with the start of the Round of 8 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</p>\n<h2>Bank of America Roval 400 results, order of finish</h2><ol><li>#88 - Shane van Gisbergen (R)</li><li>#5 - Kyle Larson</li><li>#20 - Christopher Bell</li><li>#17 - Chris Buescher</li><li>#71 - Michael McDowell</li><li>#60 - Ryan Preece</li><li>#99 - Daniel Suarez</li><li>#9 - Chase Elliott</li><li>#16 - A.J.

However, there was a missed call in this game that made life tougher on the Vikings.</p><p>In the fourth quarter, the Vikings trotted out <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3121084/will-reichard/\">Will Reichard</a> to attempt a 51-yard field goal that would have tied the game at 17 apiece.

That's because the ball appeared to hit a camera wire.</p><p>It went unnoticed at the time, but check out videos of the kick, here:</p>\n<p>If this was noticed by the officials, Reichard would have been given another chance to kick. Here's the language from the NFL rulebook, <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/skycam-interference-rule-was-misapplied-in-cowboys-jets\" target=\"_blank\">per Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk</a>:</p>\n<p>\"[I]f a loose ball in play strikes a video board, guide wire, sky cam, or any other object, the ball will be dead immediately, and the down will be replayed at the previous spot. In the event the down is replayed, the game clock will be reset to the time remaining when the snap occurred ... All penalties will be disregarded, except for personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct fouls, which will be administered prior to the replaying of the down.\"</p><p>Florio <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-didnt-have-clear-view-of-vikings-field-goal-striking-camera-cable\" target=\"_blank\">later reported</a> that the NFL didn't have a clear view showing the ball hitting the wire.</p>\n<p>Since Wentz was able to come through clutch via a 12-yard touchdown pass to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3162290/jordan-addison/\">Jordan Addison</a> with 25 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, this officiating mistake did not play a role in the outcome.

And the tandem is adding another line in the league's history books.</p><p>Two weeks after becoming <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/lions-running-backs-david-montgomery-jahmyr-gibbs-make-history-once-again-in-monday-night-win-against-ravens/\" target=\"_blank\">the first pair of teammates to each rush for touchdowns in the same game 11 times</a></span>, Montgomery and Gibbs tied an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> record by each scoring a touchdown in the same game for a 14th time. </p><p>Montgomery and Gibbs now share the record alongside former <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/DAL/dallas-cowboys/\">Cowboys</a> teammates Emmitt Smith and Daryl Johnston, who was actually broadcasting Sunday's game when the Lions' duo joined himself and Smith in the record book. </p><p>Fittingly, Gibbs and Montgomery's touchdowns occurred on back-to-back drives in the third quarter of Sunday's game against the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/CIN/cincinnati-bengals/\">Bengals</a>. </p>\n<p>Gibbs' capped off Detroit's first drive of the second half with a 20-yard touchdown reception from quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2061053/jared-goff/\">Jared Goff</a> that stretched the Lions' lead to 21-3. </p>\n<p>Montgomery's record-tying touchdown was courtesy of an eight-yard run that ultimately proved to be the game-winning score. </p>\n<p>While the accomplishment is impressive in its own right, the fact that it tied a mark that has been held for over 20 years by two of the most accomplished backfield duos in league history makes Montgomery and Gibbs' feat even more notable. </p>\n<p>During their decade as teammates, Smith and Johnston played a critical role in the Cowboys becoming the first team in history to win three Super Bowls over a four-year span. With Johnston leading the way, Smith also rose to prominence during that time period, becoming the first rushing champion to win the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/\">Super Bowl</a> before winning league and Super Bowl MVP honors the following season. </p><p>In 1995, Johnston's blocking helped Smith win his fourth rushing title in five years while also scoring a then-record 25 touchdowns on the ground. </p><p>Arguably the best fullback of his era, Johnston was underrated in terms of his value as a runner and receiver. A short-yardage specialist, Johnston scored eight touchdowns on the ground during his career. He also caught 292 passes (including a career-high 50 in 1993) that included 14 for scores. </p>\n<p>In 2002, a retired Johnston <a href=\"https://x.com/NFLFilms/status/910532628037509120\" target=\"_blank\">returned to Dallas</a> to watch Smith break Walter Payton's career rushing record. </p>\n<p>While they are one game from passing Dallas' duo, rest assured that Gibbs and Montgomery are more focused on eventually joining Smith and Johnston as Super Bowl champions, a goal that the Lions are once again striving to achieve in 2025. </p>\n            </div>",

Most of the team remained in Indianapolis this week, however, first for their exit interviews on Thursday and then to be honored by the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. </p><p>Before moving to 4-1 on the season with a dominant 40-6 win over the Oakland Raiders, the Colts welcomed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29362921/caitlin-clark/\">Caitlin Clark</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/2130759/natasha-howard/\">Natasha Howard</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678028/aari-mcdonald/\">Aari McDonald</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/29365965/makayla-timpson/\">Makayla Timpson</a> onto the field and presented them with personalized jerseys. Clark, a noted Kansas City Chiefs fan, declined to actually wear her jersey. </p><figure>\n</figure>\n<p>Clark and company drew loud cheers when they were shown on the jumbotron later in the game. </p>\n<p>The connection between Indianapolis' professional franchises is unique in American sports. The Fever and Indiana Pacers are extremely close thanks to their shared ownership, their recent success and the friendship between Clark and Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton. </p>\n<p>But even though the Colts play a different sport, they're part of the family. Multiple Colts players attended games during the Fever's playoff run, and Colts coach Shane Steichen wore a Fever shirt during a recent press conference. </p>\n<p>\"Anytime all the professional sports can support each other through their certain seasons and come out and show that support and cheer on the other teams, I think it's huge,\" Steichen said. \"I think the players love it. The fans love it. It's a lot of camaraderie back and forth.\"</p><p>While the Fever's season ended in devastating fashion, the team overcame significant adversity to earn the No. 6 seed in the playoffs and win their first playoff game and series since 2015. It would be fitting if the Colts snap their own playoff drought this season, especially after the Pacers also made a run to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> Finals for the first time since 2000. </p>\n<p>The Colts haven't been to the postseason since 2020 and haven't won a playoff game since 2018, but they're on the right path this season. They're off to a 4-1 start and have sole possession of first place in the AFC South. </p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

The Tigers did that, and now, with two home games ahead of them, they have a chance to punch a ticket to the next round without returning to Seattle.  </p><p><strong>Mariners</strong>: Baseball is a funny sport. The Mariners would've probably understood losing one of the first two games of this series coming in. But, because they were able to win Tarik Skubal's start, they can head into Game 3 with heightened spirits. The Mariners need only to split the two games in Detroit to force a return trip to Seattle.  </p>\n<h2>Game 3 prediction</h2><p>I had the Mariners taking this series, and it's in part because of how much I prefer their rotation to the non-Skubal portions of Detroit's. With that in mind, I think Gilbert will lift the Mariners over the Tigers. Let's call it a 4-1 Seattle win. <strong>Winner: Mariners</strong>. <em>- R.J.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Stephen Curry came out firing in the Warriors' preseason opener on Sunday, rattling off 14 points in 15 minutes before being shut down for the night halfway through the second quarter as Golden State defeated the Lakers, <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/gametracker/boxscore/NBA_20251005_LAL@GS/\" target=\"_blank\">111-103</a>. </p><p>Curry got on the board a little more than two minutes into the game in impressive fashion. Jarred Vanderbilt (who looked great for the Lakers, by the way), tried to pressure him 30 feet out and Curry just calmly routed him into a Draymond Green screen and proceeded into the paint for a nifty one-legged finish like he hardly even noticed the defense being played on him. </p>\n<p>It's worth noting this particular bucket because even at 37 years old, we know Curry is always going to be able to shoot, but as long as he keeps this ability to separate downhill against big-time pressure and finish these creative paint shots he will remain an elite scorer. </p><p>Curry finished 5 of 7 from the field and 3 and 5 from 3. He was clearly hunting his shot early and often knowing his minutes were going to be limited. He looked fantastic. Here's the full scoring reel.</p>\n<p>One more play to spotlight out of that package was the give-and-go with Al Horford early in the first quarter -- which highlights the significant impact Horford is going to have on this Warriors team as both a passer and floor-spacer. </p><p>It's a transition possession, and watch as Horford runs straight the short corner. Because he can shoot the 3, the defense (in this case, Bronny James) has to go with him. With Green trailing the play, and thus keeping Lakers center Deandre Ayton occupied 30 feet from the basket, that leaves the paint wide open, so Curry simply hits Horford in the corner and immediately cuts backdoor for an and-one layup. </p>\n<p>The Warriors have perhaps had centers who can make this pass (Andrew Bogut, Kevon Looney), but they have never had a starting-caliber center in the Steve Kerr era who commands this kind of attention as a 3-point shooter. </p>\n<p>You see what it opens up. If that's Looney or Bogut or JaVale McGee or Festus Ezeli or Zaza Pachulia standing behind the 3-point line, the defense just sags into the paint and Curry's path is encumbered. If you do that with Horford (as Jaxson Hayes does here), he just pulls the trigger. </p>\n<p>The threat of Horford's shooting is going to open up loads of interior space for Curry, Jimmy Butler, Brandin Podziemski, Jonathan Kuminga and all the Warriors' penetrators and cutters to finish at the rim without the opposing shot-blocker camped in their way. </p><p>Horford already looked comfortable operating in Golden State's system predicated on waiting for Curry to pop free from a maze of impromptu screens and passes. It's not an easy thing. It requires at once the patience to wait for Curry to emerge and the anticipation to make the read and pass a beat before he actually gets to his spot. It isn't for everyone, but Horford is so smart and skilled that he's clearly going to pick it all up in no time. </p>\n<p>And this is to say nothing of the defensive impact Horford will bring, which we also saw on Sunday. In the few cases that Golden State has enlisted a shooting big man (Quentin Post, Nemanja Bjelica come to mind), it has come at the expense of defense, or when they play Draymond at center it clearly costs them traditional size. </p><p>But with Horford, you get the shooting and passing <em>plus</em> what is still an All-Defense caliber center -- both as a positional defender who can show high and credibly guard on the perimeter and as a rim protector. Within his first four minutes of action, Horford rattled off the assist to Curry, a steal (after jamming up a would-be pick-and-roll before it ever got started) and this blocked shot. </p>\n<p>In his second stint, Horford cut off Vanderbilt's drive before turning his shot away at the rim. </p>\n<p>The margins of NBA lineups are so often about give and take. Someone helps your offense but hurts your defense, or vice versa. Horford, who stuffed the score sheet in 14 minutes with three points, three assists, three blocks, four rebounds and a steal on Sunday, costs you no such compromise. You get everything. And it was all on display in his Warriors' debut.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Everything you need to know about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA's</a> Coach of the Year award can be summed up in Mike Brown's two-and-a-half-year tenure with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SAC/sacramento-kings/\">Sacramento Kings</a>. The 2022-23 Kings won 48 games with a plus-2.6 net rating. The 2023-24 Kings won 46 games with a plus-1.8 net rating. The rosters were nearly identical. All eight players who played more than 1,000 minutes for the 2022-23 Kings were back on the team for the 2023-24 season. Brown more or less had two identical seasons. They were, at most, within the margin for error of one another. In 2023, Brown was chosen as Coach of the Year unanimously. In 2024, he did not receive a single vote.</p><p>This is not an award that honors coaching quality. Miami Heat maestro Erik Spoelstra has never won it. It's an award that honors performance relative to expectations. When Brown took over the Kings, they had spent nearly two decades in the lottery. In his second season, they were a reigning playoff team. Despite their nearly identical performance, they fell by seven seeds because of slightly worse health and a stronger conference ahead of them. Sure enough, those altered expectations doomed Brown in the end. He was fired 31 games into his third season in Sacramento.</p><p>So when we're evaluating Coach of the Year candidates, expectations mean just as much as performance. There certainly is a performance barometer, to be clear. Every winner since Scott Brooks in 2010 has led a top-four seed, and 10 of the last 14 winners have led No. 1 seeds. </p><p>But we're looking for overachievers here. Last year's winner was Kenny Atkinson. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/CLE/cleveland-cavaliers/\">Cavaliers</a> won 64 games against a <a href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025_preseason_odds.html\" target=\"_blank\">preseason projection</a> of 48.5. It was the same in 2024. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/OKC/oklahoma-city-thunder/\">Thunder</a> were projected to win 44.5 and they won 57, so Mark Daigneault was the winner. Every winner since Gregg Popovich in 2014 has beaten their Vegas win total line by at least 10 except for Nick Nurse in 2020, who only failed to do so because COVID-19 shortened the season. In a perfect world, there's a surprise No. 1 seed and that's our winner. In the absence of a surprise No. 1 seed, we're looking for a surprise in the 2-4 range.</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, let's take a look at this year's Coach of the Year odds and identify the best value bets on the board. We'll divide this into three sections: one for coaches with odds of +1000 or shorter, one for coaches between +1000 and +2000, and one for all coaches with odds longer than +2000. All odds come from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/caesars-promo-code/\">Caesars Sportsbook</a>.</p><h2>The favorites</h2><p>We have four coaches in this bracket, and there's one facing by far the toughest road here: <strong>David Adelman</strong> at +900. Denver is projected to win 53.5 games by Vegas. Therefore, we're asking Denver to win 64 games to significantly outperform expectations. That doesn't feel especially likely, and even if it happens, it's not clear who will get rewarded for it. There's rarely overlap between Coach of the Year and MVP. The only two overlaps we've seen since Brooks won in 2010 were Steve Kerr and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685204/stephen-curry/\">Stephen Curry</a> in 2016 and Mike Budenholzer and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2067655/giannis-antetokounmpo/\">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> in 2019. If Denver is the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, it just seems likelier that voters reward Nikola Jokić than Adelman. So even if Adelman is an improvement on Michael Malone (and the playoffs were promising in that respect), he just doesn't fit the profile of a typical winner.</p><p>Our next three candidates are, fittingly, in the same cluster of Eastern Conference teams. New York is projected at 53.5 wins, Orlando at 50.5 and Atlanta at 47.5. The betting favorite is Orlando's <strong>Jamahl Mosley</strong> at +600, followed closely by Atlanta's <strong>Quin Snyder</strong> at +700 and New York's <strong>Mike Brown</strong> at +800. The likeliest course for the Eastern Conference would be Cleveland snagging the No. 1 seed, but Atkinson failing to win for a second straight season because no Coach of the Year has ever repeated. Therefore, the No. 2 seed in the East immediately becomes our top candidate, and there's a good chance it's one of these three.</p>\n<p>So, who's the best value of the three? Vegas got this one right. Mosley makes the most sense, followed by Snyder and then Brown. Orlando and New York are the two teams with obvious top-of-the-conference potential. Atlanta is a tier below them and carries significant injury risk between Kristaps Porziņģis and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3178366/jalen-johnson/\">Jalen Johnson</a>. If Snyder's odds were a tad longer, that risk might be acceptable. At this price, it's a pass. Brown, meanwhile, has the unenviable task of replacing a coach that was by and large pretty successful. The ways in which he'll succeed in this job are mostly going to manifest in the postseason. If we assume he plays his starters less than Tom Thibodeau did (and basically every coach does), New York is probably not going to make a nine-win jump up to 60. They're just starting from too good of a place.</p><p>Orlando is the perfect middle ground. Their expectations are justifiably higher than Atlanta's, but lower than New York's. Their defensive baseline offers security few teams have, as they finished second in the NBA on that end last season despite injuries to basically everyone. Those same injuries are going to give them credit for improvement that has frankly already happened. They only won 41 games a year ago, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26775953/paolo-banchero/\">Paolo Banchero</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142358/franz-wagner/\">Franz Wagner</a> both took meaningful jumps. They just barely played together, and when they did, it was with miserable spacing that Orlando has already greatly improved upon thanks in large part to the addition of Desmond Bane. Injuries are a concern here, yes, but the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/ORL/orlando-magic/\">Magic</a> are deeper than the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/ATL/atlanta-hawks/\">Hawks</a> and frankly pretty used to compensating for absences.</p><p><strong>Best bet:</strong> Mosley at +600 is a must-have for any Coach of the Year portfolio. Snyder is a justifiable bet. I'd likely stay away from Brown or Adelman.</p>\n<h2>The middle of the pack</h2><p>I'm going to be perfectly honest: I'm not interested in any Western Conference coach with a team projected to win, let's say, 45 games or more. Sorry <strong>Ime Udoka</strong> (+1200), <strong>JJ Redick</strong> (+2000) and <strong>Ty Lue</strong> (+2000). The conference is so good and so deep that the standings tend to condense. Case in point: The difference between No. 2 and No. 8 in the standings last year was four wins. I expect Denver and Oklahoma City to run away from the pack. Everyone else is stuck in the middle. Expectations therefore factor in meaningfully. If I'm taking a coach from one of the teams that I suspect to wind up in that clump, I want it to be from a team with lower expectations.</p><p>San Antonio is right on that borderline at 44.5 wins. However, I'm lower on <strong>Mitch Johnson</strong> for a few reasons. The team is still quite young, and it's also dealing with quite a bit of stylistic overlap. Figuring out how to make <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2355019/deaaron-fox/\">De'Aaron Fox</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29557116/dylan-harper/\">Dylan Harper</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29232429/stephon-castle/\">Stephon Castle</a> work together will require deft coaching, but I imagine it takes a toll in the standings. Besides, if the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/SA/san-antonio-spurs/\">Spurs</a> go 10 games over expectations, it probably means <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/29005036/victor-wembanyama/\">Victor Wembanyama</a> has entered the MVP chat. He's likelier to be rewarded by the voters than his coach.</p><p>Just by virtue of his lower expectations, <strong>Chauncey Billups</strong> (+2000) is the most interesting Western Conference coach in this tier to me. The line is only at 34.5 wins. By trading for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1685257/jrue-holiday/\">Jrue Holiday</a>, Portland sent a message that it wants to be competitive this season. The regular season means more to the Trail Blazers than it will many of the older teams held in higher regard. If they get into the clump in the middle of the conference, they're going to be able to steal a lot of wins on effort alone. You can be a team that plays .500 quality basketball, which is roughly where I'd expect Portland to fall, but ultimately wins more games than that on circumstance. There is a world in which that happens, so Billups is an interesting swing here under the hope that the West is so tight that the Blazers manage to snag a higher seed than expected, even if the win total isn't outrageous.</p>\n<p>Really, though, my eyes are on the East. That's where there's far more room for a team to jump up and seriously contend for a top seed. <strong>Erik Spoelstra</strong> (+2000) is a justifiable bet on the premise that he'll win any tiebreaker. The voters will want to pick him if it's at all feasible considering his résumé   and the fact that he's never won. However, I'm lower on the Heat's roster than most, so I personally wouldn't expect him to seriously contend. I have the same issue with Toronto's <strong>Darko Rajakovic</strong>. That's a play-in roster to me, and a play-in team in the East just isn't going to swing it. We're looking for upside here, and the upside comes from two teams.</p><p>The first is Detroit, but I doubt <strong>JB Bickerstaff</strong> (+1000) will be able to muster much momentum for a big improvement this year since he lost last season despite helping the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/DET/detroit-pistons/\">Pistons</a> win 30 more games. If he adds another 10, which is feasible given how strongly Detroit closed last season and how young that team is, it just isn't going to look as impressive by comparison.</p><p>That leaves us with my favorite pick in this range: <strong>Nick Nurse</strong> (+1400). Look, we have no idea how healthy anyone is. We don't know if <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1755181/paul-george/\">Paul George</a> is washed. These are reasonable criticisms. But at 14-to-1, the upside here significantly outweighs the downside. I know a team with a healthy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2135528/joel-embiid/\">Joel Embiid</a>, even if it's only for 60 games instead of 80, can snag a top Eastern Conference seed because it has done so. On paper, the healthy version of this roster might be better than any <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/PHI/philadelphia-76ers/\">76ers</a> team Embiid has played on since the brief <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/1646703/jimmy-butler/\">Jimmy Butler</a> tenure. And even if Embiid does miss substantial time, having George and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3142479/tyrese-maxey/\">Tyrese Maxey</a> gives the 76ers enough room to theoretically at least stay afloat for shorter stretches.</p>\n<p><strong>Best bet:</strong> Imagine a world in which Embiid suffers an early injury and misses 20 games or so. Philadelphia goes .500. He comes back and the Sixers significantly improve. The narrative is going to be about how Nurse held them together. He's a prior winner with a great schematic reputation. He's the best combination of long odds and realistic upside.</p><h2>The long shots</h2><p>Ironically, our last two winners are in this tier, as Vegas isn't high on <strong>Mark Daigneault</strong> (+3000) and has all but dismissed <strong>Kenny Atkinson</strong> (+6000). They've figured out that this award is about expectations and improvement, and it's really hard to improve upon what Cleveland and Oklahoma City did a year ago. Your team can be too good to win this award. After all, Phil Jackson only won it once.</p><p>Your team can also be too bad. Coaches don't win this award by turning a 20-win roster into a 35-win roster. <strong>Jordi Fernandez</strong> (+5000) is an awesome young coach. He doesn't have the roster talent to compete for this award yet. So scratch off any team without a realistic chance of competing for a playoff spot.</p>\n<p>We're looking for the teams in between, those with low-to-medium expectations that they can outperform. In this group, four candidates stand out:</p><ul><li><strong>Joe Mazzulla</strong> (+2500) is probably going to steal a lot of wins on shot-selection alone. Hoisting a billion 3s can be detrimental when you're a favorite, as Boston learned against New York last spring. As an underdog, which the Celtics now are, it's a great way to create enough variance to win games you ought to lose. There's a world in which they start slow and pivot into a tank, but there's also one in which <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268018/jayson-tatum/\">Jayson Tatum</a> returns during the season and they suddenly look like a strong sleeper in April. At 25-to-1, I'd take the chance if I were building a portfolio.</li><li>Speaking of gap-year teams, <strong>Rick Carlisle</strong> (+4000) is even more enticing. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/IND/indiana-pacers/\">Pacers</a>, institutionally, almost never tank. You could argue that'd be their best use of this season, but it would be completely out of character. Carlisle is as creative as coaches get, and he has young players he can lean on for bigger roles this season like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/3178537/bennedict-mathurin/\">Bennedict Mathurin</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/28954646/jarace-walker/\">Jarace Walker</a>. He'll also get plenty of credit for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/2268640/jay-huff/\">Jay Huff</a> heist that the front office pulled off. If Indiana is in the top-six mix in the East, Carlisle will get consideration. Like Spoelstra, he's someone voters will want to reward based on his body of work, though he did win this award all the way back in 2002.</li><li>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/GS/golden-state-warriors/\">Warriors</a>, from an expectations standpoint, are in the same bucket as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/HOU/houston-rockets/\">Rockets</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAL/los-angeles-lakers/\">Lakers</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/LAC/los-angeles-clippers/\">Clippers</a>. The difference is that I can get their coach, <strong>Steve Kerr</strong>, at +5000. At 50-to-1, sure, I'll take the chance that this awesome but old roster stays healthy, builds on last season's success with Jimmy Butler and cashes in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/26602407/jonathan-kuminga/\">Jonathan Kuminga</a> trade chip midseason for something valuable.</li><li>In case you didn't notice, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/CHI/chicago-bulls/\">Bulls</a> went 17-10 after the All-Star break last season. Do I believe that was real? No, not really. But their fast-paced style is very annoying to play against over a long, 82-game season, and <strong>Billy Donovan</strong> (+7500) has made lemonade out of defensive lemons in the past. There's a shred of Sacramento in Chicago in that the Bulls are so institutionally mistrusted that just making the playoffs there rather than their annual No. 9 seed would be viewed as a significant accomplishment.</li></ul><p>If you want to add <strong>Doc Rivers</strong> (+7500) to this list, I see the argument. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/MIL/milwaukee-bucks/\">Bucks</a> are another Eastern Conference team with a wide range of outcomes. I'm just personally on the very low end of expectations for them, and if they do overperform, I suspect the credit will go to Giannis Antetokounmpo. </p>\n            </div>",

That's impossible, right?</p><p>Not to the 2025 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/ARI/arizona-cardinals/\">Arizona Cardinals</a>, who were up 21-3 on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/TEN/tennessee-titans/\">Tennessee Titans</a> on Sunday, well on their way to embarrassing No. 1 overall draft pick <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3168422/cam-ward/\">Cam Ward</a> and handing Nashville's dejected squad a fifth straight loss. Until the final stages of the Week 5 contest, that is, when those same Cardinals surrendered 19 unanswered points, including a walk-off 29-yard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3116871/joey-slye/\">Joey Slye</a> field goal that left Arizona watching the scoreboard with utter disbelief.</p><p>The Titans left State Farm Stadium on top, 22-21, celebrating their first win of the 2025 season. The Cardinals made history in the worst way imaginable, becoming the first team to lose three in a row on walk-off field goals. How, exactly, did Arizona manage to squander the game to fall to 2-3? Here are the missteps that led to their epic collapse:</p><h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2180829/kyler-murrays/\">Kyler Murray's</a> latest stall-out</h2><p>Murray started strong Sunday, leading back-to-back touchdown drives to open the matchup. It was an entirely different story in the second half, when the quarterback danced around the pocket to no avail. Even when he stood still, things didn't go right for Arizona's passing offense. The worst example came when Murray took a snap to the face, losing the ball on a third-and-long fumble. The veteran briefly left the game after this blunder, and here's how his Arizona offense fared for the entire second half: fumble, punt, fumble, punt, punt.</p>\n<h2>Emari Demarcado's goal-line hiccup</h2><p>Tabbed for a larger role with both <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2071585/james-conner/\">James Conner</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/3176915/trey-benson/\">Trey Benson</a> injured in Arizona's backfield, Demarcado had a quiet start behind <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2804075/michael-carter/\">Michael Carter</a>, then appeared to finally explode in the fourth quarter with a 72-yard dash to put the Cardinals up 28-6 and all but seal the victory. That, however, would've required Demarcado actually holding the ball into the end zone; instead, the running back slowed as he approached the goal line and let go of the rock before breaking the plane, committing a killer no-no that was just modeled by the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/IND/indianapolis-colts/\">Indianapolis Colts</a>' <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/26701928/adonai-mitchell/\">Adonai Mitchell</a> a week earlier. The fumble went out of the end zone and gifted Tennessee a touchback.</p>\n<h2>The Titans' miraculous turnover touchdown</h2><p>Jonathan Gannon's Cardinals defense finally appeared to ice the game when Titans rookie quarterback Cam Ward delivered a wayward red-zone throw on the move, with the ball ending up in the hands of diving Dadrion Taylor-Emerson, Arizona's second-year safety. Except Taylor-Emerson proceeded to lose the ball as he hit the ground, and his Cardinals teammates went into a tizzy trying to scoop it up, accidentally booting the ball into the end zone ... where an attentive <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/1860834/tyler-lockett/\">Tyler Lockett</a> promptly leapt onto the loose object for a miraculous Titans score. This touchdown pulled Tennessee within two points with roughly four and a half minutes still to play.</p>\n<h2>Cam Ward's heroic final drive</h2><p>Ward hasn't been the steadiest signal-caller for the Titans in his first year on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nfl/\">NFL</a> stage, but his first-round talent showed up when he was needed most Sunday. Within one score after the improbable turnover-fueled touchdown by Tyler Lockett, Ward got the ball back after a quick Cardinals punt late in the fourth. He then led an 11-play, 71-yard drive of his own in under two minutes, headlining the effort with a picture-perfect sideline bomb to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/2186328/calvin-ridley/\">Calvin Ridley</a> that allowed Tennessee to burn additional clock and set up Slye's walk-off field goal.</p>\n            </div>",

Officials from the NBA league office and the players' union told ESPN adding prize money would not conform to the existing bonus structure. Ishbia has not consulted the league office.The 3-point contest hasn't had as many issues getting stars to participate as the dunk contest has. Damian Lillard won this year's 3-point contest -- his third such title -- and prior winners include Stephen Curry (twice), Klay Thompson and Karl-Anthony Towns. This year, Lillard defeated several other big names, including Devin Booker, Jamal Murray, Tyrese Maxey and Donovan Mitchell. Curry has already committed to participating in this event next year.\nThe dunk contest, however, has been a different story. Keshad Johnson, who is averaging about seven minutes per game this year for the Miami Heat, won the event over Carter Bryant, Jaxson Hayes and Jase Richardson, none of whom average more than seven points per game. The last player to win the dunk contest the same year he was an All-Star was former Clipper Blake Griffin, who jumped over a car in 2011.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Imagine scoring a decisive goal for your team, just as they are under pressure from a potential comeback in the second leg of a Champions League playoff, and choosing not to celebrate. This is exactly what happened to Galatasaray striker Victor Osimhen on Wednesday night in Turin as the Nigerian star didn't celebrate the goal that basically ended Juventus' dreams of qualification last 16 of the UCL. Galatasaray were close to a surprising elimination after winning the first leg of the playoffs 6-2 last week in Istanbul, a positive result that led to a disappointing second leg played in Italy. Juventus showed to be a strong team under Luciano Spalletti and after scoring the opening goal in the first half with the penalty of Manuel Locatelli, Bianconeri defender Lloyd Kelly received a controversial red card at the beginning of the second half. Despite the disappointment, Juventus were able to score two more goals with Federico Gatti and Weston McKennie, taking the match to extra time when Osimhen's key goal ended Juventus' dreams. The striker refused to celebrate while his teammates, which included former Inter captain Mauro Icardi.Take a look:\nThere might be multiple reasons that can explain such a gesture, or lack thereof, but first of all, we need to go back to the summer of 2024 when Juventus tried to sign Osimhen when he decided to leave Napoli with the arrival of Romelu Lukaku. Osimhen held discussions with the Bianconeri and sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli, the same one who had previously brought him from Lille to Napoli. That move ultimately failed to go through, largely due to Napoli's reluctance to make the deal, and he has since joined Galatasaray and has been an absolute star. After scoring 37 goals in 41 games last season and 16 more this season. Was it out of respect for a club that showed such interest? Was it out of respect for his former coach Spalletti? Or could there be an interest in going back to Itay and joinig Juventus at some point?\nAt just 27 years of age and one of the best strikers around, the prolific striker still has so much to offer. What his long-term future looks like remains to be seen, having joined the Turkish club on a permanent deal last summer, but continued performances like this won't do anything but increase the interest from some of the biggest clubs around, including, potentially, a striker-needy team like Juve.Speaking to CBS Sports after the game, Osimhen explained he was \"disappointed with the performance of the team.\"\"[We've have] to improve a lot because Juventus deserved to win, even if I'm happy for my team,\" he said. \"I knew it was difficult to come and play here. I tried to motivate my teammates. I think some of them were scared of the crowd and the way Juventus played.\"\nOn Tuesday, before the match against Juventus, Osimhen spoke in the pre-match press conference and said that \"Juventus are one of the biggest clubs in the world. They are rich in history and so many legends have played for this club. When they approached me at the time, I was eager to join before my move to Galatasaray, but then things became complicated. Right now, though, I'm very happy at Gala but in the future, you never know what might happen. If opportunities arise, there are several clubs I would like to play for. Playing here would be a privilege; for any player, it's ideal, and 90% of footballers would love to wear the Juventus shirt at some point in their career.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- The Cleveland Cavaliers announced that star guard James Harden suffered a fractured right thumb during their 109-94 win over the New York Knicks Tuesday night. Harden played 32 minutes and finished with 20 points, four assists and two rebounds, but a subsequent evaluation of his thumb confirmed the presence of a fracture.Despite the diagnosis, surgery is not required and Harden is not expected to miss much time, per ESPN. The expectation is that Harden will wear a wrap or splint on his hand as he attempts to play through the injury. He was initially listed as questionable for Wednesday night's game against the Milwaukee Bucks before being ruled out. \"A postgame examination by the Cavaliers' medical staff, followed by X-rays taken [Wednesday], confirmed a non-displaced fracture of the distal phalanx,\" the team said. \"Harden will undergo treatment and continued evaluation. An update on his status will be provided as appropriate.\"Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said Wednesday that Harden was not complaining about his thumb during Tuesday's game, and he was unsure when the injury occurred. He declined to go into specifics about a timeline or plan for Harden and said the team will have more information after he's evaluated.\"I don't have my lab coat on, I'm not gonna go there,\" Atkinson said. \"I do think it's early. I think these things take time. Obviously, James is famous for his availability. There's a lot that goes into this. For me to sit here and start making judgments -- we'll have more information once the medical staff looks at him a little more.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NBA MVP Rankings: Victor Wembanyama jumps into top three, Cade Cunningham could win by default\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt appears Cleveland has avoided disaster with Harden not being immediately ruled out for a significant period of time. The Cavs have gone 6-1 since trading for Harden in early February. He has established immediate chemistry with Donovan Mitchell in the backcourt, giving Cleveland someone who can take offensive pressure off Mitchell in a way Darius Garland couldn't.\"They're two guys that are hungry to take that next step, and they've hit it off. Kinda been seamless, really,\" Atkinson said of the relationship between Mitchell and Harden. \"Got two guys who are so passionate about the game, they're both hoop junkies, they're both smart and they both have great [work] ethics. Usually, when you have that kind of synergy, it goes well. Really with them I haven't seen any misunderstandings or 'You should have went there.' They've been pretty locked in on the court and off the court. Couldn't have gone better so far.\"Harden is averaging 18.9 points, eight rebounds and 4.6 assists as a member of the Cavs. Before the trade, he averaged 25.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.8 assists in 44 games for the Los Angeles Clippers this season.\nCleveland (37-22) is tied with the Knicks for third in the Eastern Conference and 2.5 games ahead of the Toronto Raptors (34-24). How much the injury impacts Harden remains to be seen as the Cavaliers try to make a deep playoff run.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly two years after the NBA banned him for life for a violation of league gambling rules, former Toronto Raptors and Memphis Grizzlies forward Jontay Porter has a role with a different professional basketball league. The Seattle SuperHawks of the United States Basketball League announced that they signed Porter to their 2026 roster, giving him his first playing opportunity since the exit from the NBA.Porter's arrival in the USBL raises eyebrows, particularly because of the league's stated commitment to fair competition.\"The games we play must be decided on the court,\" the USBL says as part of its league values. \"Every rule we establish, every policy we implement, and every decision we make is guided by a commitment to fair competition. Players, coaches, and fans must be able to trust that the outcomes they witness are earned through skill, preparation, and effort -- nothing else.\"The SuperHawks are one of eight teams in the rebirth of the USBL, which opens its season on March 6. The league originally operated from 1985-2008 and produced a number of eventual NBA players including Manute Bol and Spud Webb.Porter is tied to the FBI investigation into illegal sports betting, which shook the NBA last fall, and he previously pleaded guilty in 2024 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Two defendants in the federal case allegedly threatened Porter, forcing him to remain involved in a scheme wherein parties gathered inside information on NBA games and relayed it to bettors.\nIrregular betting activity on Porter's player props in 2024 flagged potential wrongdoing. The NBA found that Porter disclosed information about his health status to a bettor ahead of a March 20 game, and another bettor wagered $80,000 on a parlay that would win $1.1 million if the under hit on Porter's player props. Porter exited from that game due to illness less than three minutes into the contest. The bet was frozen and never paid out.After a separate game earlier that season, DraftKings sent a report to users that stated the under on Porter's made 3-pointers was the biggest winner among all NBA props from Jan. 26, 2024.The NBA also found that Porter placed at least 13 bets on NBA games from January to March 2024 using an associate's account. He wagered a combined $54,094 and netted $21,965. None of those purported bets involved games in which Porter played, but he bet on the Raptors to lose as part of a multi-game parlay.\nPorter's case is one of the few rare instances in which the NBA disciplined a player for violating its gambling policy. The league prohibits anyone affiliated with the NBA from betting on NBA properties and requires players to attend anti-gambling training sessions on an annual basis. It also employs data scientists to monitor sports betting issues.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Weston McKennie's impressive goalscoring run continued on Wednesday, this time scoring the crucial goal that ensured Juventus would take Galatasaray to extra time in the UEFA Champions League's knockout phase playoffs before falling 7-5 on aggregate.Juventus entered Wednesday's second leg after a 5-2 defeat in Istanbul last week. They pulled one back in the first half thanks to Manuel Locatelli. Though Lloyd Kelly's red card in the 49th minute complicated matters, Federico Gatti's 70th-minute goal put the Turin-based side within touching distance of extra time. McKennie's goal in the 82nd minute, though, ensured the hosts would get another 30 minutes to prove themselves in the hopes of reaching the round of 16.The hosts earned a free kick on the left flank, the ball looping to the far end of the box, where Teun Koopmeiners was waiting. Koopmeiners, who scored a brace at Galatasaray last week, sent the ball near the opposite post, the ball sailing towards the goal line. McKennie had his eyes on the ball as soon as it neared Koopmeiners' head and made a run to meet it at the post, and then got his head on the ball to ensure it landed in the back of the net.Watch the strike below.\nGalasaray turned things around in extra time and scored twice, first through Victor Osimhen's goal shortly before the halftime break and then another from Barıs Alper Yilmaz in the 119th minute. The victors are now in the Champions League round of 16 for the first time in 12 years and are the first Turkish team since the 2017-18 season to get this far.\nThe goal was McKennie's eighth of the season across all competitions for Juventus, the U.S. men's national team midfielder already in the midst of a career-best goalscoring run. He played as a left wingback on Wednesday, which comes as little surprise for the team's longtime utility player, but he has been in attack-minded roles since Luciano Spalletti became the coach last fall. Spalletti has showcased McKennie's versatility even as attack remains the focus, once describing him as the \"perfect central striker\" and even inserting him there at Galatasaray last week.McKennie finds his footingWin or lose, it's hard not to argue that the knockout phase playoffs were full of good news for the USMNT – McKennie's goal comes a day after Johnny Cardoso scored for Atletico Madrid and a week after Folarin Balogun notched a brace for Monaco. Coupled with the fact that U.S. players across Europe are currently in fine form and others, like Bournemouth's Tyler Adams and PSV's Ricardo Pepi, are returning to the pitch after weeks-long injuries, it feels like the USMNT players are beginning to peak at just the right time as the World Cup nears.McKennie, though, is perhaps the poster child for the USMNT players' upward trajectory. The 27-year-old has made the rare transition from a mere regular in Juventus' lineup to a central part of the team's attack, Spalletti fully utilizing the American's attacking skillset after a handful of predecessors chose otherwise. It has paid off in more ways than one – Juventus have added another dimension to their goalscoring operation, McKennie is useful from set-piece opportunities, and often makes impactful runs to score goals from close range. McKennie's contributions are much-needed for a Juventus team that could use an out-and-out goalscorer, the American doing his best to make up the gaps.From the player's perspective, the goalscoring run is a signal that things have changed for the better in Turin. He has frequently been deemed surplus to requirements, only to stick around to make up the numbers and work his way back into the coach's good graces. There was no adjustment period with Spalletti, though – not only has he been a regular fixture in the new coach's team, Spalletti has gotten the best out of McKennie, no matter the task the player's been assigned. Take Wednesday's match as an example – McKennie regularly finds himself on the wing in Spalletti's set-up, but he rarely plays as a left wingback for the new coach, though he remained an attacking force for a Juventus team in desperate need of goals. He created four chances from that position, his best game of the season in that sense, and later scored at the end of a set-piece sequence.\nMcKennie is expected to be back for the USMNT's friendlies against Portugal and Belgium in March, likely to join the national team for the first time since October after head coach Mauriico Pochettino preferred the player settle in with Spalletti during the November international break. McKennie's form is as great a form of vindication as Pochettino could receive for that choice, leaving the head coach with only good problems as a wide variety of players compete for World Cup roster spots – and starting roles. McKennie's abilities in goal creation and end product leave Pochettino with just as many options as Spalletti to utilize the player's versatility, both skills well-suited for the U.S. coach's high-intensity, attack-minded style of play.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The title defence rolls on, but, in sharp contrast to 12 months ago, Paris Saint-Germain really do not feel like a team who are bound for the final. The dynasty might just be on pause for this season at least.If that seems a curious response to a 2-2 draw that took the holders beyond Monaco then ask yourself this question: how different might this tie have been if the young men from the principality had not contrived to get themselves sent off in the critical moments of both legs? For Aleksandr Golovin in the Stade Louis II read the previously exceptional Mamadou Coulibaly. When he careened into Achraf Hakimi in the 58th minute, Monaco were level in the tie and looked slightly more likely to find its seventh goal. Adi Hutter's side were doing a little with a lot: purposefully breaking out from their lines of five and four without the ball, exploiting the running power of Folarin Balogun out in the channels and getting players up in support of him. They might not have dominated possession -- who does against a Luis Enrique team? -- but they were getting into the right spots and doing with an energy that their illustrious hosts could not match.That is a real problem for PSG, who did get the job done quite swiftly after Coulibaly saw red. Desire Doue's cross from the byline was turned in by Marquinhos, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia pounced on the rebound when Philipp Kohn spilled a long ranger from Achraf Hakimi: these were partly a reward for the final third pressure the hosts applied with their man advantage but no less a reflection of a young opponent who'd had the stuffing knocked out of them by their reduction in numbers. \nxG race from PSG's 2-2 draw with Monaco, whose sending off came in the 58th minute \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            There might have been more in this for Monaco than they realised, Jordan Teze ghosting in at the back post to turn in almost unmarked in a fashion not dissimilar to the opener from Magnes Akliouche. On both occasions, PSG had the numbers to comfortably deal with the situation, and none of them seemed willing to take control of the season. That could scarcely be a greater contrast from last season, when intensity was the defining trait of this team. Luis Enrique's men would outrun anyone in Europe, and at this stage, their blend of quality and industry was shining through so clearly against Ligue 1 opposition that you suspected this was a different outfit to the many who had fallen short in the Champions League.Tonight, you half expected to see one of the old guard ambling around the field out of possession, waiting for the other guys to do the defending and get the ball up to them. It is becoming increasingly clear that PSG relied on Ousmane Dembele for more than just his clutch goals. It is hard to believe that the best pressing Ballon d'Or-level striker of his generation would have allowed Monaco to so easily work their way out of the counter press when PSG frequently gave the ball away in the Monaco half. \nThe issue here is that the 13 total starts Dembele has made this season is altogether more normal for him than the run of fitness he found 12 months ago. Good squad planning means having good cover for the players you know are most vulnerable. It's not entirely clear that a front three of Bradley Barcola, Doue and Kvaratskhelia, with Goncalo Ramos filling in here and there, is that.Dembele is not the only one who is feeling the burn. Fabian Ruiz was missing tonight; it is hard to find a cornerstone of that championship team who hasn't missed time. And that's not a surprise. This was a team coached to hit its peak on May 31, 2025. Then they had to play on for another six weeks and seven games. The Club World Cup exacted a heavy burden. Luis Enrique has tried to mitigate that with rest and rotation, but maybe that explains why so many basic passes were going awry.When they didn't, this was still a team that could run rings around better opponents than Monaco. There is something irresistible about PSG's left winger dragging the opposition out of position to create space for an underlapping Nuno Mendes to fizz in a low cross from the byline. Get Kvaratskhelia going at his man, and it's good night and good luck. Last season, PSG could manufacture those spots a dozen times a night. Now they are flashes of what once was.\nWhat they are now is not a team that exists at the same level as Arsenal and Bayern Munich, the two clear favorites to win this competition. It might not even be enough to get comprehensively clear of Barcelona or Chelsea, the two teams that they could get in Friday's draw. At this stage a year ago PSG seemed to have the momentum to push themselves to the heights they had always dreamed of. Now they are back to the crushing realities of what a team looks like when it doesn't have the energy to match its talent.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the aftermath of their gold medal sweep at the 2026 Winter Olympics, the U.S. men's and women's hockey teams have been at the center of some controversy. While the men's team was celebrating its first gold medal win in 46 years, President Donald Trump called to offer his congratulations and joked about inviting the women's team to the State of the Union.\"I must tell you, we're gonna have to bring the women's team,\" Trump said in a video of the call posted to social media. \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\"The joke elicited audible laughs from several people in the men's locker room. And while the men's team was honored at the State of the Union on Tuesday night, the women's team declined the invitation. In an interview with ESPN, Hilary Knight, the captain of the women's team, described Trump's joke as \"distasteful\" and said it took away from \"amazing gold medal feats\" by women across the board at the Olympics. As for the relationship between the men's and women's hockey teams, Knight said that a \"quick lapse\" has \"overshadowed\" the tight-knit bond that was formed in Italy.\"I think the guys were in a tough spot,\" Knight said. \"It's a shame that this storyline and narrative has blown up and is overshadowing our connection, genuine interest in one another and cheering each other on. We've had phenomenal relationships in the [Olympic] village and supporting each other on the world stage -- and also the professional stages. I look forward to those friendships and acquaintances continuing in great fashion.\"\n\n        \n            \n                U.S. women's hockey team declines invitation to attend the State of the Union\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nKnight, who set the U.S. women's record for Olympic points and goals with her game-tying tally against Canada in the gold medal game, said the story has presented everyone with a chance to re-examine how they talk about women's accomplishments across all disciplines.\"I think this is a really great learning point to really focus on how we talk about women, not only in sport but in industry,\" Knight said. \"Women aren't less than. Our achievements shouldn't be overshadowed by anything else other than how great they are.\"On Wednesday, Jeremy Swayman, a goalie on the men's team, returned to practice with the Boston Bruins and expressed some regret for the way Team USA initially responded to President Trump's joke.\n\"We should've reacted differently,\" Swayman told reporters. \"We know that. We are so excited for the women's team and have so much respect for the women's team. To share that gold medal with them is something that we'll be forever grateful for. Now that we're home, we get to share that together forever, seeing the incredible support we have from the USA and sharing this incredible gold medal.\"\n            ",

Under Jeanie Buss, the Lakers had a much smaller operation where they leaned on those inside Buss' circle of trust. Whether Bennett's arrival comes at the specific request of Walter, or simply part of a greater willingness to expand the operation, he'll provide the Lakers with a unique perspective on scouting at the college level. Bennett's new position as an advisor with the Lakers is his first official role with a basketball team since his shocking retirement at 55 years old prior to the 2025 season. \nBennett coached at Virginia from 2009-2024, leading the Cavaliers to a 364-136 overall record with two ACC tournament titles, six ACC regular season titles, 10 NCAA Tournament appearances and a national championship in 2019. Bennett's Virginia program produced five first round picks -- Justin Anderson, Ty Jerome, De'Andre Hunter, Trey Murphy III and Ryan Dunn -- and he also coached Klay Thompson at Washington State prior to leaving for Virginia. The Lakers hold their own first round pick and have not had tremendous success in the draft in recent years. Some of that is due to them not having first round picks in 2025 and 2022 due to trades, but in 2023 and 2024 they took Jalen Hood-Schifino and Dalton Knecht -- both selected at No. 17 overall -- and neither positively impacted the Lakers rotation. \nWith Luka Dončić as the new star L.A. is trying to build around and a cap sheet that will clear up tremendously over the next two years, the Lakers will be looking to finally hit on their first round pick in 2026 and get a cost-controlled rotation piece to add to their core. They will lean on Bennett's eye for the college game to try and have better success with their pick this year, as their lack of picks in 2027 and 2029 makes it even more imperative to hit on this year's opportunity in a strong draft class. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The first year of the NCAA's new single transfer portal window for football brought plenty of drama and also loads of complaints about the new-look college football calendar. With spring practices set to begin soon, the NCAA is trying to get ahead of teams potentially circumventing the portal by bringing in additional players to their roster. With the removal of the spring transfer portal window, there is concern from the NCAA that schools could try to add athletes who did not put their name in the portal by simply having them transfer schools as any student would -- withdrawing from their current school and then enrolling at the new school outside of the portal window. To prevent that, the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision Oversight Committee issued three recommendations to the Division I Cabinet for punishments that they hope would be severe enough to curtail such behavior. \nIf the measure is approved, once an enrolled student-athlete who was not active in the Transfer Portal at the time of transfer participates in any athletically related activity at the next school, the following actions would occur: The head coach would be prohibited from all football (recruiting and on-field coaching) and administrative duties (team meetings) through the sixth contest of the season.The school would be fined 20% of its football budget. The school would be required to reduce the number of roster spots by five for the next season, regardless of the head coach's employment status at the school. If all of those suggestions are adopted, they would be among the strongest penalties the NCAA has ever handed down for a violation -- beyond the actual death penalty. A full six-game suspension for the head coach, a substantial fine from the program's football budget and a reduction in roster spots are far more than just a slap on the wrist. \n        \n            \n                NCAA tampering memo promises penalties for rule-breakers: How Dabo Swinney may have invoked change\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGiven what we've seen in college sports of late, it seems like a guarantee that the first time these penalties, if adopted, were handed down, lawyers would get involved and the NCAA would find itself in another high-stakes court case over its jurisdiction to prevent such transfers. The key element in the NCAA's favor in that regard is that these penalties don't try to prevent the transfer itself, just the athlete's ability to play for their new school's football team. \nWe'll find out in due time whether the Division I Cabinet accepts this proposal in full or if it is revised. And then it will be up to the coaches and schools to decide whether they want to be the ones to test the legitimacy of this new policy in the court system. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        As the fantasy basketball season winds down, deep-league managers know that streaming can be the difference between climbing the standings and falling short. With injuries, suspensions, and late-season shutdowns reshaping rotations, opportunity is emerging in unexpected places. This article highlights 10 under-the-radar players who are seeing expanded roles and turning increased minutes into tangible production. From recent trade additions to young contributors capitalizing on frontcourt vacancies, these names offer short-term upside with category juice. If you're searching for rebounds, defensive stats, or a 3-point boost, these viable streaming options can provide a timely edge in competitive deep formats.Kobe Brown, PacersBrown joined the Pacers via trade at the deadline. After averaging 8.7 minutes per game through his first 34 appearances of the season with the Clippers, he is up to 27.2 minutes per game with his new squad. He is making good use of his expanded role, averaging 10 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 0.7 steals per game, including hauling in a season-high 10 rebounds in the most recent outing. He is likely to continue to see a notable role, as the Pacers work through injury trouble and are not expected to push their regular stars too hard without a shot at the postseason. Guerschon Yabusele, BullsYabusele found a new home with the Bulls via trade in early February and has been thriving ever since. He averaged just 8.9 minutes per game through 41 appearances with the Knicks, but is up to  25.5 minutes per game, including six starts through eight outings since joining the Bulls. He is averaging 10.6 points, six rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 0.8 steals per game with his new squad, including two double-doubles and a single-game season-high of eight assists. He should continue to handle a notable role within their limited frontcourt rotation. Olivier-Maxence Prosper, GrizzliesProsper was locked into a deep bench role for most of the season until late January, when he began to see more consistent action. His playing time picked up after the Grizzlies parted ways with Jaren Jackson, allowing Prosper to take a step up in the rotation. He is averaging 12.7 points, 4.5 rebounds, one assist, and one steal over his last 10 appearances, playing more than 20 minutes in eight. He topped the 20-point mark for the first time this season twice within his last five outings and is converting a blistering 71.4 percent from the field over that span.  \nPaul Reed, PistonsReed has been a solid contributor all season for the Pistons, but was mostly limited in his opportunities, falling behind Jalen Duren and Isaiah Stewart at the center position. However, with Stewart being suspended, Reed has stepped up to deliver an average of 16.3 points, 6.5 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 1.5 steals, and 2.5 blocks, while shooting 64.4 percent from the field over the last four games. While Stewart will be out until March 3, there is still time to take advantage of Reed's expanded role. Julian Strawther, NuggetsStrawther has been making the most of a boost in playing time during the injury absence of Peyton Watson, who is set to remain out for at least another week. Strawther is averaging 15.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and one steal, with 2.3 made 3-pointers per game over six consecutive starts. His ability to contribute on both ends and the addition of his long-range shooting make him stand out from most players on this list. He should continue to prosper in the expanded role until Watson is back, but he will also likely retain a fair amount of playing time beyond that point.  Precious Achiuwa, KingsAchiuwa has seen his role pick up for a while now. But with the more recent addition of Dylan Cardwell to the injury report, as well as Domantas Sabonis being shut down, he is now in line to handle a significant role through the remainder of the season. Achiuwa is averaging 12.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists, two steals, and one block in 24.8 minutes per game over five consecutive starts. He also has two double-doubles in his last three outings, including his first 20-and-10 game of the campaign in the most recent outing. \nYanic Konan Niederhauser, ClippersKonan Niederhauser saw very limited action to start the season but has earned a notable boost since his squad parted ways with starting center Ivica Zubac. Konan Niederhauser is still in competition with Brook Lopez for minutes at the position, but is making his case as a reliable option, averaging 5.9 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks in 15.4 minutes per game over the last eight games. He has scored in double digits twice and has hauled in a high of eight rebounds twice in that span. He is also coming off the best defensive display of his young career, with four blocks in the last game. John Konchar, JazzKonchar is settling into his new home with the Jazz after being traded from the Grizzlies, along with Jaren Jackson. He has been a modest contributor throughout his NBA career, showing a knack for long-range shooting. Although he has yet to stand out offensively for his new squad, he has made a strong impression with his defensive impact, an area where he has also shown success in the past. He is averaging 4.2 rebounds and two steals in 22.2 minutes per game across six games. He could be a sneaky add for managers needing a boost in the above-mentioned areas. It is unclear how his playing time may hold up down the stretch, but with the recent injury to Vince Williams, there may be room for him to continue to pick up a fair amount of floor time. Baylor Scheierman, CelticsThe Celtics have cycled through a few different players at the starting wing positions this season, but Scheierman is the most recent standout, as he is averaging 8.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 0.7 steals over the last 10 games. His field-goal percentage is underwhelming, at 43.7, but he is knocking down 1.6 3s per game as a consolation. The second-year forward also has three double-doubles with points and rebounds among the last 10 games and should continue to enjoy a notable role that is his to lose. \nJa'Kobe Walter, RaptorsWalter is averaging 18.8 minutes per game on the season but has seen a boost and delivered improved production since the beginning of February, where he is averaging 9.1 points, 3.7 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 1.3 steals, along with two made 3s per game over seven games. He looks to be earning his way by providing an intense defensive effort. There is certainly room for him to solidify a dedicated role as an energy guy off the bench, as the Raptors look to find their rhythm heading towards a postseason run. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        There's no guarantee J.J. McCarthy will start at quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings during the 2026 season, that revelation coming this week from executive vice president of football operations Rob Brzezinski, who said at the NFL combine the franchise is are \"exploring all possibilities\" at the position.The Vikings watched eventual Super Bowl champion Sam Darnold sign with the Seattle Seahawks as a free agent last March after hitching their wagon to McCarthy, a former 2024 first-round pick who was inconsistent during his first campaign as a starter.McCarthy finished with 1,632 yards passing, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions over 10 games, going 6-4 overall after missing his rookie season with a knee injury.\"What we do know is we need a level of baseline quarterback play for us to be effective,\" Brzezinski said. \"A lot of this has been J.J. in unfortunate (situations) with some of the injuries and things that he's dealt with, but we're going to explore every opportunity, and I don't think there's anything specifically we're looking for. We can't manufacture anything that's not there. So No. 1, what are the options? Is it reciprocal? Is it financially doable? All those things. There's just a lot of factors that go into it.\"\nNeither Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell, nor Brzezinski, endorsed McCarthy as Minnesota's expected starter during separate interviews in Indianapolis this week. O'Connell did say he felt like McCarthy, who missed the team's regular-season finale in January with a hand injury, could still be a franchise quarterback.O'Connell was previously a firm believer in the former Michigan standout to lead his offense after Minnesota selected him at No. 10 overall two years ago in the draft.\"It's just the timeline is in a different place for all of us than it was at that point,\" O'Connell said this week, via ESPN. \"And I have a responsibility -- we have a responsibility collectively as we put together this team -- to make sure that we use the data that we have at this time and the experiences we have, the feelings that we've had at different times as an organization.\"\nMcCarthy is signed through the 2027 on his four-year rookie deal which includes $21.8 million guaranteed. Brzezinski said the team was not\" ruling anything out\" with their plan at quarterback. Aaron Rodgers is a free agent, along with Malik Willis. There's an expectation Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray could be as well since he hasn't spoken with the team since the end of the season.The Indianapolis Colts have a decision to make with Daniel Jones. He's set to hit free agency unless the team franchise tags him or gets him to agree to a new deal.Each of these signal callers could be potential targets for the Vikings if they're not comfortable with moving forward with McCarthy as QB1 for next season.\n            ",

Yeah, yeah, I know they \"have to show it in the playoffs,\" but let's call it what it is: San Antonio is a top-tier contender because the Spurs are an incredibly well-rounded and deep team with a player in Victor Wembanyama who geometrically alters an NBA floor to a degree we haven't seen since prime Stephen Curry. Curry expanded the space you had to cover. Wembanyama, who turned what has always been a clear distance of separation into blocked shots, shrinks the space in which you have to operate. It changes everything, including this so-called \"have to take all the steps\" timeline everyone loves to call a championship requirement. The 2015 Warriors won one playoff series with Curry before jumping from 51 wins to 67 and winning the whole thing. \nI'm not saying the Spurs will do that, but if they don't it won't be because they're not ready. The West is just a torture chamber. Only one team can survive. But that's still a month and change down the road. Right now, there is no way to call the Spurs, who have won nine straight and beaten the Thunder four times, anything other than the best team in the league. With that, let's get to this week's Power Rankings. Note: As a general Power Rankings rule, we're going to try to strike a balance between what we've seen in the last week, the season as a whole so far, and what can reasonably be expected to play out over the rest of the season. This week there is a greater emphasis on that last factor after the trade deadline has passed and given us a clear picture of where every roster officially stands. We will not go so far as to rank these teams based on championship expectations, because in that case it would take a lot more to alter, at least in tiers, the generally accepted hierarchy. Winning matters, and it will get you on the move up this board form week to week. But if you're beating bad teams, just as an example, and probably playing a little above your head, it's not necessarily going to be reflected in a completely commensurate climb up the rankings. Or vice versa.\n        Biggest Movers\n    \n                5\n            \n                Heat\n            \n                5\n            \n                Nuggets\n            RkTeams\n                    ChgRcrd\n                                1\n                            \n                                    Spurs\n                                \n                            San Antonio has won nine straight, a stretch that includes wins over both conferences' top seeds. The Spurs are one of two teams with a top-six offense and defense with the other being the Thunder, whom they've beaten four out of five times.  \n                        \n                            --\n                        \n                            42-16\n                        \n                                2\n                            \n                                    Pistons\n                                \n                            Detroit is neck and neck with OKC for the best record in the league. The Pistons blasted the Knicks (again) without Jalen Duren or Isaiah Stewart. Cade Cunningham may very well end up winning MVP. Tough, old-school defense is their backbone, but as we saw in the loss to San Antonio on Monday, when Cade isn't dominating they don't really have any other way to create offense. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            43-14\n                        \n                                3\n                            \n                                    Thunder\n                                \n                            OKC has come way back to earth since its 24-1 start, going 21-13 since. Still good, but injuries have hit the Thunder hard. Jalen Williams missed the first month of the season and has played just three times over the past five weeks. SGA has missed eight straight games. Still, the Thunder took care of the surging Cavs without J-Will or SGA and have the best record in the league thanks to that dominant start through the easiest portion of their schedule. \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            45-15\n                        \n                                4\n                            \n                                    Celtics\n                                \n                            The Celtics have won nine of their last 10. They took apart the Lakers for their 11th win of the season by 20 or more points (only the Thunder have more). Jaylen Brown has played like an MVP even if he has no chance of winning the award. Jayson Tatum could still be coming back.  \n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            38-19\n                        \n                                5\n                            \n                                    Cavaliers\n                                \n                            The Cavs have won six of seven with James Harden in the lineup. The highest-scoring third-quarter team in the league, they took apart the Knicks coming out of halftime on Tuesday and rolled to their 15th win in their last 18 games. ...But then news broke Wednesday afternoon that Harden has a fractured thumb on his non-shooting hand. We'll see how long he's sidelined, but it could be a blow for a team that's finally clicking.\n                        \n                            1\n                        \n                            37-23\n                        \n                                6\n                            \n                                    Timberwolves\n                                \n                            Minnesota held off Portland on Tuesday and has now won four of its last five. Jaden McDaniels is balling, averaging better tan 16 points on 55/48/81 shooting splits in February with premium perimeter defense. The Wolves are three up on the seventh-seeded Suns, who just lost Dillon Brooks to a broken hand. A top-six seed feels pretty likely at this point, and top-four is there for the taking. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            36-23\n                        \n                                7\n                            \n                                    Rockets\n                                \n                            The Rockets blew a 16-point fourth-quarter lead to lose the Knicks on Saturday. The point guard hole has become more and more glaring as the season has gone on. It too often feels like the stagnant offenses we've seen from Kevin Durant teams in the past where he's relied on to make too many tough shots over the long haul. All the ratings look like a contender, but I'm losing trust in this team at that level. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            36-21\n                        \n                                8\n                            \n                                    Nuggets\n                                \n                            The Nuggets put 157 on the Blazers on Friday after coming out of the All-Star break with a one-point loss to the Clippers. They have lost six of 10 since Nikola Jokić returned for the final game of January, and have lost their last seven games against plus-.500 teams. Aaron Gordon's absence is huge. They can't truly contend without him.\n                        \n                            5\n                        \n                            36-22\n                        \n                                9\n                            \n                                    Knicks\n                                \n                            The good news is Karl-Anthony Towns has found his stroke for the moment. He's shooting 63% over four games since the All-Star break and has made nine of his last 13 3s. The bad news is he only took five shots in the loss to Cleveland on Tuesday, when you would've been forgiven for forgetting he was even on the floor at times. Had the Knicks not rallied from 16 down in the fourth to beat the Rockets they would be 1-3 post-All-Star, but they have also won 12 of their last 16. Tough to call this team a contender, but tough to fully dismiss them, too. \n                        \n                            2\n                        \n                            37-22\n                        \n                                10\n                            \n                                    Lakers\n                                \n                            Luka Dončić had a look at a game-tying 3 in the waning seconds vs. Orlando Tuesday night, but it was a bit too deep for his taste, By the time he hesitated and stepped in the shot was no longer available and LeBron had to hoist up a prayer that never had a chance.

    "body": "\n        It's not every day that a kicker makes headlines for his contract demands, but that's exactly what's happening this week with Brandon Aubrey. The Cowboys are trying to get a long-term deal done with their kicker and they're even willing to make him the highest-paid player ever at his position, but a deal hasn't gotten done because of Aubrey's asking price. The 30-year-old reportedly wants to be paid somewhere close to $10 million per year. On one hand, that's a totally absurd asking price, especially when you consider that it would be a 56% jump over the current highest-paid kicker in the NFL in Harrison Butker, who's making $6.4 million per year. To put that in perspective, that would be like Lamar Jackson trying to get a new deal that pays him $93.6 million per year, which would be a 56% jump over the current highest number for a quarterback. It's also an interesting asking price because of how much leverage the Cowboys' currently have in the situation. Since Aubrey is a restricted free agent, the Cowboys will have to place a tender on him if a long-term deal doesn't get done by the start of free agency on March 11. If the Cowboys place a second-round tender on him, that means that other teams will be able to make him an offer, and if he leaves, his new team will have to send a second-round pick to Dallas. If he stays in Dallas and plays under the second-round tender, that means he'd make $5.8 million for the 2026 season. If that happens, the Cowboys could hit him with two franchise tags in a row, so the next three years would look like this: \n2026 salary: $5.81 million (second-round tender)2027 salary: $6.97 million (franchise tag)2028 salary: $8.37 million (second franchise tag)If you're the Cowboys, there's no reason to meet his $10 million asking price because you essentially control him over the next three years at $7.05 million per year. If Aubrey leaves after being hit with a tender, then the Cowboys will get a second-round pick out of it (or a first-round pick if they were to use the first-round tender), so it wouldn't be a total loss. The Cowboys have historically played hard ball with several players, including Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb, before overpaying for them down the road, but that's not the case with Aubrey. The Cowboys have reportedly offered him $7.5 million per year, which seems more than fair. However, this is one of the few situations where it makes sense for both sides to be stuck in. \nWhy Aubrey's asking price is reasonableAubrey is arguably the most valuable kicker in the NFL and he wants to be paid like it. From his standpoint, it makes sense to ask for a price that the Cowboys likely won't pay because that all but guarantees that he'll get to test the waters of (restricted) free agency. Aubrey will get to see what his value is and if he doesn't like what he sees, he can go back to Dallas and sign for $7.5 million per year, because it's unlikely the Cowboys would pull their offer. Basically, this allows him to get the best of both worlds. If he leaves Dallas, it will be because another team was willing to meet or come close to meeting his $10 million per year asking price. So is he worth $10 million per year? I would say the answer is yes. The smartest front offices in the NFL understand the importance of kicking and if you need proof, just look at the last few Super Bowl teams. The Chiefs have played in three of the past four Super Bowls and they have the NFL's highest-paid kicker in Butker. The Eagles have played in two of the past four Super Bowls and they have the second-highest paid kicker in Jake Elliott ($6 million per year). Elliott has struggled in the regular season over the past two years, but he hasn't missed a beat in the playoffs and he's been one of the best postseason kickers in NFL history. \nSeahawks kicker Jason Myers came close to winning Super Bowl MVP this year after hitting a Super Bowl record five field goals in Seattle's 29-13 win over the Patriots. Myers is currently the eighth-highest-paid kicker in the NFL, but when he signed his most recent extension in 2023, he was the second-highest-paid kicker.  The teams that taking kicking seriously are the teams that spend money on the position or spend a draft pick on the position. Of the past 15 teams to draft a kicker, all of them have made the playoffs within two years of drafting the kicker. That's not to say that the kicker led them to the postseason, it just means that the smartest front offices are focusing on the position and the teams with the smartest front offices are usually the ones making it to the postseason.If you don't want to draft a kicker, which can be a crapshoot, then you need to pay big when one of the top ones becomes available and that's what's about to happen with Aubrey. \nFor Aubrey to be worth $10 million, that means someone has to be willing to pay him that much and there will almost certainly be at least one front office that will be willing to pull the trigger. Just consider these two situations: The Rams might have gone 15-2 with a better kicking situation last season. The Falcons probably would have won the NFC South with a better kicking situation in 2025.In scenarios like that, $10 million almost seems like a bargain (And on that note, we've got some potential landing spots for Aubrey here). The other thing working in Aubrey's favor is that he's the ultimate kicking weapon: \nIn just three seasons, he has already made more 60 yard field goals (6) than any other kicker in NFL history. Only one other active player has more than two and that's Matt Prater (3). During a Week 14 game against the Lions, he became the first and only player in NFL history to hit three field goals of 55 yards or more in the same game. Even in this era of long distance kicks, no one had ever done that until Aubrey came along. Aubrey has also been automatic from inside 50 yards. Sometimes, you'll have a kicker with a big leg who struggles with his accuracy, but that's not the case here. In 2025, there were 17 kickers who attempted at least 25 field goals from 50 yards and in. Aubrey was one of just two who hit 100% of their attempts (Ka'imi Fairbairn was the other), so he was automatic. In 2025, there were 12 field goals hit from 60 yards or more and Aubrey has three of them. Jacksonville's Cam Little was the only other player with more than one, so two players combined for five of the 12 kicks from 60 yards or more. Basically, if you have one of those two players, you have monstrous leg up on the competition and every NFL team should be looking to get a leg up. There seems to be a belief that every kicker is hitting from 60 yards in the current NFL, but that's simply not the case. Last season, there were only nine kickers who hit from 60 yards or longer and there were only four who hit from 63 or longer. Since Aubrey's first year in the NFL, there have only been 21 field goals of 60 yards or more and Aubrey has six of them. No other kicker has more than two. Kickers are certainly hitting 60-yard field goals at a higher rate, but they're still a rare occurrence, unless you're Aubrey. The Cowboys kicker is so good from that range that he's the only player in NFL history to hit from 60 yards in the first quarter of a game. What that tells you is that he's the only kicker playing right now who has the total trust of his coach to hit from that range. \nYou can point to his field goal percentage of 85.7% in 2025 and say he's struggling, but that's not really the case. He's just asked to do things that no other kicker is asked to do. Aubrey went 36 of 42 in 2025 with all six misses from 51 yards or longer (He went 10 of 16 from that range). Aubrey is so good that it almost works against him, because he gets sent out for more long-range kicks than anyone else. One of those six misses was from 68 yards, which would have tied the NFL record. He also has a 70-yard miss in his career. Despite those long misses, he's still the fifth-most accurate kicker in NFL history. If you only count field goals from 55 yards and in, Aubrey is the second-most accurate kicker in NFL history, so you get the close-range accuracy with the bonus of a guy who can hit long-range bombs on a regular basis. If anyone deserves $10 million, it's Aubrey. The more realistic scenario is that he ends up getting $8 million or $9 million per year, but he's going to eventually get paid and he's going to deserve every penny he gets. \nOne thing to remember with Aubrey is that he didn't start playing in the NFL until he was 27. He's now 30 years old and he's only likely only going to get one or two long-term deals, so it makes even more sense for him to make sure he's getting top dollar with this deal. When you're the best at something in the NFL, you need to make sure that you're paid like the best and that's what Aubrey is trying to do here. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        New Cleveland Browns coach Todd Monken complimented Shedeur Sanders for his \"elite playmaking ability\" on Wednesday at the NFL combine, but said he expects to have an open quarterback competition that gets narrowed down as the 2026 regular season approaches.\"Sure he can,\" Monken said about the possibility of Sanders becoming Cleveland's starter. \"I think what you see is elite playmaking ability. That's in him. You've seen it. We've seen it. You saw it in college. You saw it on tape last year. Sure, there's a ways to go, but what rookie isn't? I mean, what first-year player doesn't have a long way to go? So I'm excited to get started with him and all of our quarterbacks and all of our players.\"The Browns also have Deshaun Watson and Dillon Gabriel under contract for 2026. Monken anticipates having an \"open competition\" for the starting job between those three. And while he'd like to have his starter figured out by training camp, that may not be the case.\"I don't know why it wouldn't be an open competition, and I don't mean that harshly, but I don't think there's enough on film over the last couple years, one way or the other, to say, 'Boy, we have a starter at quarterback' yet, whether internally or externally,\" Monken said.\nThe Browns started three quarterbacks -- Joe Flacco, Gabriel and Sanders -- in 2025. Watson did not play at all in 2025; he tore his Achilles midway through the 2024 season and then tore it again a few months later. The Browns traded three first-round picks to the Houston Texans in March 2022 and then gave Watson a fully guaranteed five-year, $230 million contract. The NFL suspended Watson for the first 11 games of the 2022 season in the wake of 20-plus lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct. Ever since, Watson has played poorly and struggled with injuries.\n        \n            \n                Who are the top defensive prospects entering the 2026 NFL combine? Top 5 by position\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSanders, a fifth-round pick, started Cleveland's final seven games last season, taking over after his fellow rookie, Gabriel, suffered a concussion in Week 11. Sanders completed 57% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also ran for 169 yards and a touchdown and took 23 sacks.Among 43 players with at least 150 dropbacks in 2025, Sanders finished 42nd in touchdown-to-interception rate, 42nd in net yards per pass attempt and 42nd in passer rating. Despite the unkind numbers, Sanders managed to show off some of the playmaking Monken described. Sanders' 11.7 yards per completion was the 10th-highest among that same sample of 43 quarterbacks.\nThe Browns finished 5-12 and fired coach Kevin Stefanski after the season. Monken, who was previously Lamar Jackson's offensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens, takes over a team with lots of defensive talent -- led by Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett and Defensive Rookie of the Year Carson Schwesinger -- but in dire need of upgrades across the board offensively.\"I think the biggest thing that we want to see from Shedeur is just continued growth,\" Browns general manager Andrew Berry said Tuesday. \"I think he grew a lot from start one to start seven. I think certainly playing more efficiently, not putting the ball in harm's way as much would be important while maintaining the ability to produce out of structure and generate explosive plays.\"You're not going to see all of that in the upcoming months because we're not on the field. So the biggest thing that he can do is learn the new offense, get in with the coaching staff once our offseason program starts, continue to work on his body physically and then make strides when we actually get on the grass.\"\n            ",

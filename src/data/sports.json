    "body": "\n        There are three top 25 matchups on the Week 9 college football schedule, all of which take place in the SEC. Ole Miss vs. Oklahoma, Missouri vs. Vanderbilt and Texas A&M vs. LSU all have College Football Playoff implications, making Saturday's matchups intriguing for college football fans and bettors alike. According to the latest Week 9 college football odds, the Commodores are favored by 2.5 points at home, while the over/under for Missouri vs. Vanderbilt is 52 points. SportsLine's model is backing Missouri, which is 5-0 in its last five games against Vanderbilt, to cover the spread in 65% of simulations. The model is also backing Michigan (-14.5) to cover the spread in an in-state rivalry against Michigan State, while the Over (48.5) hits 66% of the time in Texas A&M vs. LSU.

Bet it now at Caesars Sportsbook: Missouri +2.5 vs. VanderbiltThe Tigers have dominated this series in recent years, winning each of their last five meetings against the Commodores. Vanderbilt has also lost four of its last six home games against Missouri, and Eliah Drinkwitz's team enters Saturday's SEC showdown 8-2 against the spread in its past 10 games on the road. The model has Missouri covering the spread 65% of the time in its latest simulations.  Michigan -14.5 vs. Michigan StateThe Wolverines are 5-2 in their last seven meetings against Michigan State, and the Spartans have struggled mightily on offense in recent weeks, scoring 13 points in each of their past two games. In addition, the Spartans are 0-7 against the spread in their last seven games at home. SportsLine's model is backing Michigan to cover the spread in 66% of simulations, targeting the Wolverines as one of its top Week 9 college football picks. Over 48.5 points in Texas A&M vs. LSULSU's offense has been inconsistent this season, but if history is any indicator, these two teams will soar past this total on Saturday night. The total has gone Over in four of the last five games between LSU and Texas A&M, and more than 50 points have been scored in four straight meetings between these teams. The last time LSU hosted Texas A&M in Death Valley, 72 points were scored.

Rozier specifically has been implicated for a 2023 game in which he pulled himself out early. Law enforcement claims more than $200,000 was wagered on his prop bet unders.With the sports world facing its largest gambling scandal since sports betting became legal in the U.S., the NFL sent out a memo to all 32 teams reminding executives, team presidents, general managers, coaches, players and NFL employees of the gambling policy. As for what is allowed, legally placing bets on other sports and non-football prediction markets is permitted, as long as it is not done on team property or when traveling with the team. Players can also participate in traditional fantasy football, as long as the prize money is $250 or less. \nHowever, they were instructed to not:Place any bet on NFL footballThrow or fix any NFL game or event, or otherwise manipulate or attempt to manipulate any play or other aspect of an NFL gameShare confidential, non-public information regarding any NFL game, player, or event with any third-partyPlayers were instructed to report if a third party attempts to solicit or inquire about non-public information regarding players or teams, or if a third party approaches a player about fixing the outcome of a game or player stats. Failing to do so will be considered a violation of the gambling policy, and subject to discipline. Players that place wagers on their own team's games will be suspended for a minimum two years.The NFL also stated that the league is, \"Monitoring player podcasts and investigating those that may be associated with or sponsored by any gambling entity.\"\nThe NFL has not suspended a player for gambling since 2023.\n            \n    ",

Bichette, who has not played since suffering a knee injury in a collision at home plate on Sept. 6, is on Toronto's World Series roster, the team announced Friday morning. Outfielder Joey Loperfido was taken off the roster in a corresponding move.Bichette is in the Game 1 lineup, batting cleanup and playing second base.\nGame 1 will be Bichette's major-league debut at second base. He last played the position in Triple-A in 2019, and that was only one game. He did work out there earlier this week. It's possible Toronto will replace him defensively in the late innings, with Isiah Kiner-Falefa the obvious candidate to come in and play second base. \"I know I'm good enough to play,\" Bichette said Friday before Game 1. \"And I feel good enough to produce. So that's all that matters to me.\"\nThe Blue Jays could have put Bichette at DH, though that would mean moving George Springer to the outfield, and he's dealing with his own knee issue. Springer last played the field on Sept. 24 and played more games at DH (82) than in the field (54) this year. With no great options, Bichette is at second base and Springer remains at DH in Game 1.\nBichette, 27, hit .311/.357/.483 with 44 doubles and 18 home runs in 139 games this year. At the time of his injury, he was on pace to lead the American League in hits for the third time in the last five years. Bichette and the Blue Jays will face the Los Angeles Dodgers when the World Series begins Friday night at Rogers Centre in Toronto.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The arrests of Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier in the federal investigation into sports betting and illegal gambling called into question how the NBA is working to protect its players from the dark side of the wagering world. And according to Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, the league has not done enough in that regard.Brown, who serves as a vice president of the National Basketball Players Association, lamented the lack of discourse between the league and its athletes about staying safe in the era of legalized sports betting. Whether it be the dangers of soliciting information to bettors or fans' regrettable behavior towards players, Brown said there is ample work to be done in keeping players out of harm's way.\"A lot more could have been done to help players and prepare players,\" Brown said in his Friday pregame media availability. \"But even in the aftermath, I don't think little care or attention to detail goes into it. They're like, 'You make X amount of money or X, Y and Z, you should be able to deal with all the extra negativity, people approaching you about parlays. It creates a negative discourse around the game and players when people have money involved.\"Complicating matters is that the NBA has business partnerships with sportsbooks, which produce immense revenue from wagers made on the league's games, teams and individual players. Commissioner Adam Silver called this week for stricter regulations on sports betting and said the NBA asked some of its partners to pull back on some of their player prop bet offerings in an attempt to prevent game manipulation.\"I don't think once from my conversations with the union and the NBA has been like 'How can we protect players more with the environment?'\" Brown said. \"There's been little to no conversation about that. It's all about 'How can we increase business and increase revenue?' I'm not sure if we're having enough conversations about the aftermath or the consequences some of that stuff has.\"\nBillups and Rozier were among the more than 30 people arrested by the FBI as part of the investigation. Billups was allegedly connected with illegal high-stakes poker games, and Rozier was allegedly tied to a ring of current and former NBA players trading inside information with bettors.\"That whole world was introduced a couple of years ago, and I don't think they took players into consideration, especially with the energy and the behavior that goes around gambling and how that directly correlates with players,\" Brown said. \"We don't benefit from any of the profits or anything like that, but we gotta deal with a lot of the extra negativity and scrutiny behind all the gambling stuff. On top of that, it creates more integrity issues, et cetera. I'm not sure what the answer is going forward, but definitely something that people gotta spend more time having conversations about.\"This is the NBA's second major gambling scandal in the last two years. The league banned Jontay Porter in 2024 for his role in a scheme involving his prop bets.\n\"Protecting the safety of players and coaches has always been of critical importance,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement. \"League security works with team officials and law enforcement to respond to any type of fan behavior that violates our code of conduct -- whether that's in our arenas or online.  We have put safeguards in place, including social media monitoring, to track and mitigate any potential threats or safety risks. And we have increased communications to fans attending games to reinforce our code of conduct and emphasize that disrespectful and abusive behavior will not be tolerated.\"\n            ",

The rookie started the first five games of his career but missed the last two weeks with what was described as a \"family situation.\" He has not practiced this week and is reportedly set to miss at least one more game with the Chiefs set to host the Washington Commanders on \"Monday Night Football.\"Simmons, the No. 32 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, returned home to California prior to the Chiefs' Week 6 game and was ruled out on the availability report with a \"personal\" designation. Coach Andy Reid initially declined to comment on the situation but this week offered a positive update on his first-year offensive lineman.\"My update for you with Josh would just be, there's communication,\" Reid said. \"I'm not going to get into all of it. Everything's positive. It's not a negative situation. He's taking care of family.\"Simmons protects quarterback Patrick Mahomes' blind side, and in his absence, backup Jaylon Moore stepped into the lineup to handle the blocking duties in victories over the Detroit Lions and Las Vegas Raiders. When asked for comment on Simmons' situation, Mahomes said he would keep things behind closed doors.\n\"I'll keep conversations kind of between us,\" Mahomes said last week. \"But I'm always praying for him. I'm praying for all my teammates, so I'm always praying for him. I'll just keep everything else kind of private to us.\"The Chiefs are 2-0 without Simmons and won their last two games by at least two scores. They racked up 30 points against the Lions and 31 points against the Raiders.\nThis is the second time in as many seasons that Simmons missed extended time. He sat more than half of his final year at Ohio State after he suffered a season-ending knee injury, but he still played a key role in the Buckeyes' run to the national championship. Across his six games in the lineup, Simmons posted the lowest pressure rate (0.7%) of any tackle in the country with at least 100 pass-blocking snaps.\n            \n    ",

The Blue Jays have a 1-0 lead in the 2025 Fall Classic after running away with Game 1 on Friday night. The Jays exploded for a nine-run sixth inning on Friday, and they'll host Game 2 on Saturday.The Jays punched their ticket to the Fall Classic with a Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night as George Springer hit a game-winning home run. This is Toronto's first World Series appearance since 1993, when they won their second consecutive title. The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series. They are the first defending champion to reach the World Series the next season since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies, and, in more than a few ways, this year's Dodgers are better than last year's.Yoshinobu Yamamoto will be on the mound for the Dodgers in Game 2 as L.A. tries to bounce back from just its second loss of the postseason. Kevin Gausman gets the ball for the Blue Jays.The Blue Jays (94-68) are the home team over the Dodgers (93-69) in the World Series because they had the better regular-season record.

Yamamoto will be making his fourth start of the postseason, having previously surrendered four runs across 19 ⅔ innings pitched. He's struck out 18 batters versus issuing just four walks in those outings.Blue Jays: The Blue Jays will attempt to take a 2-0 advantage in the best-of-seven series. MLB teams to do that have then, historically, won more than 80% of those sets. Toronto is looking for the franchise's first World Series title since winning consecutive championships in 1992-93.\nGame 2 predictionThe hope is that this series goes seven games and that they're mostly nailbiters. With that in mind, we'll have Yamamoto delivering and tying the series at 1-1 ahead of the locale shift to Los Angeles. Dodgers win 3-2. -- R.J. Anderson\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series is upon us, which means we're anywhere from four to seven games (seven please!) from awarding both belt and title for another Major League Baseball season. That honor will of course go to either the Los Angeles Dodgers, representatives of the National League, or the Toronto Blue Jays, winners of the American League pennant.  It's a compelling matchup, to say the least, and, just like in 2024, it features the Dodgers against the AL East champion. While the Dodgers go in as the heavy favorites, the Blue Jays are more than worthy, as they prevailed in one of MLB's toughest divisions and also had to overcome the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners during their current playoff run. So, yes, while most expect another Dodgers championship, this is baseball, which means no outcome can be truly surprising.  Behind all the batted balls, strikeouts, tense moments on the bases, and, ultimately, hoisting of the trophy will be the storylines underpinning the 2025 World Series. To set all of those scenes, let's have a look at all those subplots that will back up all the action to come in this edition of baseball's signature event. Onward …  1. The Dodgers' quest to repeat No team has won back-to-back World Series since the 1999-2000 Yankees, which means the Dodgers are a mere four wins from joining this very exclusive list:  \nTeam \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tConsecutive World Series won \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1998-2000 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tThree \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1992-93 Toronto Blue Jays \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1977-78 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1975-76 Cincinnati Reds \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1972-74 Oakland Athletics \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tThree \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1961-62 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1949-53 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tFive \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1936-39 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tFour \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1929-30 Philadelphia Athletics \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1927-28 New York Yankees \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1921-22 New York Giants \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1915-16 Boston Red Sox \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1910-11 Philadelphia A's \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t1907-08 Chicago Cubs \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTwo \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAs you can also see above, no NL squadron has achieved this feat since the Big Red Machine in 1975-76. If the current Dodger model pulls this off, will it be the most impressive repeat ever? One can make that case because the 2025 Dodgers will be the first team ever to secure a repeat while surviving four rounds of postseason play -- the Wild Card Series win over the Reds, the NLDS triumph over the Philadelphia Phillies, the NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers, and now the World Series clash with the Blue Jays. To boot, the Phillies, Brewers, and now Blue Jays are all certifiable juggernauts, at least insofar as the 2025 campaign is concerned.  2. L.A. and the march to 10 titles  The Dodgers at present have won eight World Series titles in their history (dating back to Brooklyn), and that puts them within tantalizing reach of championship No. 9. Given that the Dodgers' window for contention figures to remain open for some time -- thanks to the aggressiveness of lead operator Andrew Friedman and an ownership group that, miracle of miracles, actually cares about winning -- it will hardly be shocking if championship No. 10 comes along at some point during the current decade. That brings us to this very short list of clubs that have logged double-digit World Series trophies: the Yankees with 27 and the Cardinals with 11. Very soon, the Dodgers may take the next necessary step -- the penultimate step -- toward joining those exclusive ranks. If they win this year, they'll break a tie with the hated San Francisco Giants, who also presently have eight titles. That would pull the Dodgers into a tie with the Red Sox and Athletics, who each have nine.3. Dave Roberts and three rings The Dodgers' venerable and decorated skipper is already among the very best in his guild and bound for the Hall of Fame one day. In his 10 seasons as L.A. manager, Roberts has guided them to 10 postseason berths, nine division titles, five 100-win seasons (and perhaps a sixth had the COVID-abbreviated 2020 season been a standard one), and a 65-45 record in playoff games (in other words, Roberts' teams have played at a 96-win pace in playoff games). As well, Roberts' career winning percentage of .621 is the best all-time mark among managers with at least 1,000 games to their credit. Roberts is also 368 games over .500 for his career, which puts him 10th all-time on that list (every manager ahead of him managed at least 16 seasons). Shall we go on? OK. Near at hand is Roberts' chance to win the World Series for the third time. He already has rings from 2020 and 2024, and he's four wins away from adding 2025 to his collection. Specifically, he's close to becoming just the 11th manager ever to win three or more World Series titles.4. The Dodgers' current postseason dominance  En route to reaching the World Series, the Dodgers swept the Reds 2-0 in the opening round, prevailed 3-1 over the Phillies, and then swept the Brewers. High-level mathematics reveals that's good for a record of 9-1 so far  in the 2025 postseason. Obviously, the Dodgers are more worried about winning the World Series before them than dominating it, but what if they do dominate it? A sweep of the Blue Jays would put their 2025 postseason record at 13-1, and that would make history.  Obviously, we had plenty of perfect postseasons back in the old days when all that meant was a World Series sweep. Since layers were added to the playoffs, however, it's become a rarity. In the divisional era, only the 1976 Reds at 7-0 ran the table across multiple postseason series. Since the wild card round was added in 1995, though, no team has gone undefeated in postseason play. The 2005 Chicago White Sox and 1999 Yankees each went 11-1 during their run to the title, and that comes to a wild card-era record postseason winning percentage of .917. If the Dodgers sweep Toronto, their 13-1 playoff record would come to a winning percentage of .919.5. Shohei Ohtani and ultimate individual glory  The biggest baseball star in the world seems likely to claim the National League MVP award for a second straight year. He's already notched the NLCS MVP award on the strength of his unforgettable 10-strikeout, three-homer performance in Game 4 against the Brewers. Now comes the possibility that he takes World Series MVP laurels, too. If he pulls that off, Ohtani will be truly walking with the October gods. Across MLB history, just five players have won the MVP and the World Series MVP in the same season: Sandy Koufax of the Dodgers in 1963, Frank Robinson of the Orioles in 1966, Reggie Jackson of the A's in 1973, Willie Stargell of the Pirates in 1979, and Mike Schmidt of the Phillies in 1980. Ohtani, though, is aiming for the trifecta: the MVP, and the LCS MVP, and the World Series MVP, all in the same season. Only Stargell in '79 has achieved that elusive feat. Will Ohtani join him?  6. Shohei Ohtani and exclusive World Series home run company  No, we're not done with Mr. Ohtani. It won't be the least bit surprising if he goes deep against the Blue Jays and, if/when he does, Ohtani will become the second Japanese-born player to hit a home run in the World Series. He'll join Hideki Matsui of the Yankees, who homered against the Marlins in 2003 World Series and hit three out versus the Phillies in the 2009 World Series.  But wait: That's not all! Presumably, Ohtani will take the mound against Toronto in this series, almost certainly as a starting pitcher. That raises the distinct possibility that he'll become just the 14th pitcher ever to hit a home run in a World Series game. The list of those moundsmen to power up in the Fall Classic spans from Cleveland's Jim Bagby in 1920 to Joe Blanton of the Phillies in 2008. No pitcher has ever homered multiple times in a World Series, and Ohtani is of course very much capable of that.  7. The Blue Jays and the \"three rings\" club  The Blue Jays are angling for their third World Series title in franchise history, one to join their back-to-back rings in the early 1990s. That brings us to the matter at hand, which are the franchises that have won at least three World Series championships. Here's the fraternity to which the Blue Jays are pledging:  TeamWorld Series titlesYankees27Cardinals11Athletics, Red Sox9Dodgers, Giants8Pirates, Reds5Braves, Tigers4Cubs, Orioles, Senators/Twins3To the Jays' substantial credit, they've been around since just 1977, while every team on the list above is an old-line franchise that dates back to the early 20th century and in many cases beyond that point. If Toronto is able to beat the Dodgers, they'll join the Guild of Three in historically hasty fashion. 8. George Springer and the postseason home run list  Given the way he was grimacing in obvious discomfort after clawing his way back from an HBP on the knee earlier in the ALCS, it was perhaps fair to assume Springer's normally imposing power capabilities were compromised. Then in the deciding Game 7 against Seattle, he did this in clutch-most fashion:So, yes, sore knee and all, Springer is still very much capable of tapping into his power reserves. Speaking of which, Springer now has 23 postseason home runs to his credit. All-time, only Manny Ramírez with 29 and Springer's former Astros teammate Jose Altuve with 27 have more. As leaderboards go, that's a fine one to be on. Is it possible Springer will manage to climb higher on this list versus the Dodgers? It so happens that Springer with Houston in 2017 racked up five home runs in the World Series against these same Dodgers. If he repeats that feat, he'll pass Altuve for second place. As such, this one bears monitoring. 9. Max Scherzer's shot at history  Will the 41-year-old future Hall of Famer make a start in the World Series? In the ALCS, he didn't get the call until Game 6, so there's no guarantee. He would, however, make history if he does start against the Dodgers. If Scherzer gets the nod for one of the games against the Dodgers, then he'll become the first pitcher ever to make a World Series start for four different franchises. He's previously done so as a member of the Tigers in 2012, a member of the Nationals in 2019, and a member of the Rangers in 2023. Across a total of four career World Series starts, Scherzer has an ERA of 3.18 with no unearned runs allowed.  10. The Bo Bichette question  The Jays' star shortstop and pending free agent enjoyed an impressive bounce-back regular season, and he put up impressive numbers for a player who mans such a premium defensive position:  \nHowever, Bichette has been sidelined since Sept. 6 with a left knee sprain, the result of a collision with Yankees catcher Austin Wells. He was ruled out of the ALDS and ALCS, but he's back for the World Series. In Game 1, he'll man second base (a position he has never played in the majors) and hit cleanup. The question, of course, is whether Bichette is truly 100% and whether he'll be less than his usual self at the plate and in the field. Toronto believes he's in fighting shape, and Bichette will no doubt be a critical factor in this series.\"I think if anybody had doubts that I could do my job there, I wouldn't be playing there, so I feel good about where I'm at,\" Bichette said Friday before Game 1.And now for a bonus storyline that loops together both teams …  11. Ohtani and Toronto You'll of course recall that Ohtani two offseasons ago was thought to be close to signing with the Blue Jays. That, however, turned out to be based on inaccurate reporting, and the early December 2023 rumors that had Ohtani on his way to Toronto to ink a free-agent pact were roundly false. Even so, unjustified hard feelings may linger among Jays rooters, and Ohtani might be greeted with a vigorous booing for Game 1 at Rogers Centre.Now let's get on with it.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The cliché unstoppable force vs. the immoveable object is used often in sports, but in Week 8 with the high-flying Dallas Cowboys (3-3-1) offense heading into Denver to face a stout Broncos (5-2) defense, it's appropriate to use regarding this matchup. Dallas' trio of quarterback Dak Prescott (1,881 yards passing, second-most in the NFL), running back Javonte Williams (592 yards rushing, second-most in the NFL) and wide receiver George Pickens (607 yards receiving, fourth-most in the NFL) are the only teammate trio in the NFL this season to rank top five in the league in passing, rushing and receiving. The Cowboys have seen one teammate trio do that over the course of an entire NFL season since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger: the Hall of Fame trio of quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith and wide receiver Michael Irvin in 1992. That was when that core won their first Super Bowl title. That's also on top of All-Pro receiver CeeDee Lamb returning in Week 7 from a three-game absence because of a sprained ankle. He racked up 110 yards and a touchdown on five catches against the Washington Commanders last week. Tight end Jake Ferguson also ranks fourth in the NFL in catches (51) and tied for second in the league in touchdown catches (6) with Pickens and Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams. On the other side of the ball, Denver's pass rush is the NFL's best: they lead the league in both sacks (34) and quarterback pressure rate (44.9%). Two Broncos edge rushers, Nik Bonitto (eight sacks, third-most in the NFL) and Jonathon Cooper (six sacks this season, tied for the fourth-most in the NFL), rank top five in the NFL in sacks. The Broncos' two cornerbacks are also standouts: Patrick Surtain II is the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year, and Riley Moss's 37.5% completion percentage allowed is the lowest among 76 defenders with at least 30 passes thrown their way this season.   \nPrescott will be making just his second trip to Denver to face the Broncos despite being Dallas' starting quarterback for 10 seasons (since 2016). His sole past trip came in Week 2 of the 2017, his second NFL season, and much of Denver's defense from its Super Bowl 50 core -- edge rusher Von Miller and cornerbacks Aqib Talib and Chris Harris -- knocked Prescott and Dallas around in a 42-17 Broncos' home win. Denver's current crew evokes memories of the Broncos' defense of old for Prescott. \"Yeah, I named some of those older guys, but Bonitto and Surtain, right, they're just a [fair] comparison as some of those guys that I played back then. So credit and respect to them. ... Obviously, they know that they go hand in hand for them,\" Prescott said Thursday. \"Corners can be a little bit more aggressive, sit a little bit more, play those routes, knowing that they're getting home on defense with just their rush. Leading the league in sacks, right. Dominating on third down. So a lot of credit or a lot of respect for them. Just continue to go in there and play my game. Starts with beating the pass rush and when you got the receivers I do, having confidence in them to win. ... Just know going into the game and the game plan... you might not get to [read] No. 4. Sometimes you might not get to [read] No. 3 right? So it's important for the receivers to understand how aggressive they have to be and understanding the time clock. We'll be fine.\"Both sides are buckling up for a heavyweight clash between two of the best units in football come Sunday afternoon at Mile High. \n\"It's what you play the game for. Regardless if we were both first or not, it's what you play the game for -- elite competition,\" Prescott said. ... \"An amazing environment where the fans are going to be loud, our communication is going to be tested, the non-verbal part of it. Yeah, super excited. It'll be a great one.\"Cowboys offense vs. Broncos defense NFL Ranks, 2025 seasonDAL OffenseNFL RankDEN DefenseNFL RankPPG31.72nd18.14thTotal YPG380.31st273.13rdYards/Play6.12nd4.52ndRush YPG122.114th93.39thPass YPG268.32nd179.96th3rd Down Conversion Rate44%7th29.2%1stQB Pressure Rate33.3%7th44.9%1stSacks8T-2nd341stCompletion Percentage71.2%3rd55.9%1stPass TD16T-2nd7T-2ndPasser Rating105.77th82.85thWhere to watch Cowboys vs. Broncos liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 4:25 p.m. ETWhere: Empower Field at Mile High (Denver)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+ (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -3.5; O/U 51 (via FanDuel Sportsbook)Cowboys vs. Broncos: Need to knowHow will Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, head coach Brian Schottenheimer manage the passing game vs. Broncos' No. 1 pass rush?Despite knowing Prescott won't have as much time to survey the field on Sunday, that doesn't mean Schottenheimer will change his aggression level as a play caller when it comes to dialing deep shots to Pickens and Lamb. The Cowboys are excited to face the Broncos' man coverage-heavy defense: Denver plays man coverage at the fourth-highest rate in the NFL (36.3%).\"I don't think so because again what they do, which is smart because of their pass rush, they like to play a lot of press man to man,\" Schottenheimer said when asked if Denver's pass rush changes his downfield aggression. \"We'll see what they do with Patrick [Surtain] and who they match him on, if they match him at all. I think they will, but we'll see. They want to rush the passer, they want to disrupt the timing. I'm quite certain they're going to be very comfortable. They do it against Cincinnati and teams like that that have unique weapons like we do. It will be a fun matchup to watch.\"Williams, who played his first four seasons with the Broncos after being selected in the second-round of the 2021 NFL Draft, will also factor into slowing down Denver's pass rush. The NFL's second-leading rusher has been looking forward to the homecoming against his former team.\"They're making it all grimy. I mean we got to go into this game expecting them to do just that, win dirty,\" Prescott said. \"No matter what it takes and whatever we have to do, run into some tight boxes, right, but we got to make our plays outside when they give us one-on-one and put ourselves in some of those third and manageables, short of the third and seven and we'll have the upper hand.\"Will Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus go back to running his heavy zone scheme vs. Broncos QB Bo Nix? Former Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn helped mold Dallas into a top five defense built on generating quarterback pressure and takeaways while running man coverage on 33.8% of their defensive plays from 2021 to 2023, the third-highest rate in the NFL in that time frame. After Dallas ranked 31st in scoring defense (30.7 points per game allowed) and last in the entire NFL in total defense (411.7 total yards allowed) through the first six weeks while running zone coverage on a league-high 87.2% of defensive snaps in 2025, new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus altered his approach. Dallas ran man coverage at a season-high 46.9% rate in Week 7, per TruMedia, against Quinn's Washington Commanders, and Dallas' defense had their best performance under Eberflus in a 44-22 Week 7 victory. That 46.9% man coverage rate was the highest in the NFL in Week 7. How stark of a shift did Eberflus make with his defense? Dallas' next highest man coverage rate of the season was 14.1% in Week 5 at the New York Jets, a 37-22 Cowboys road win. \"Yeah, each week's different. Let's be honest, we played good defense yesterday. They had a few guys out, I don't feel bad for them. We've had a lot of guys out. But we're not sitting here saying, 'Hey we're ready. We're it.' We're not saying we're it right now in any phase,\" Schottenheimer said on Monday. \"But we're going to keep working hard, and we put together a great plan, the guys executed that plan. The guys practiced well. It showed up throughout the week and, man, the communication, I just can't say enough about that.\" Eberflus didn't just get more aggressive with his coverage, he also did so with his utilization of the blitz: the Cowboys' 42.5% blitz rate in Week 7, the eighth-highest blitz rate in the league last week, is their highest of the year by a sizeable margin. The next closest blitz rate Eberflus called was back in Week 3 against his former employer, the Chicago Bears, in Week 3: 28.6%. Naturally, the Cowboys racked up four sacks vs. Washington  by four different players -- linebacker Kenneth Murray, linebacker Shemar James, edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney and edge rusher Donovan Ezeiruaku -- for their second-best sack production of 2025 trailing just their five of New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields in a 37-22 Week 5 road win. Entering Week 7, Dallas had blitzed on just 22.4% of opponents' dropbacks, the seventh-lowest rate in the league. Looking ahead to Week 8, no team has had more plays with a screen thrown than the Broncos' 47 in 2025. Despite Cowboys' players and fans' complaints, Dallas may go back to playing more zone coverage in Week 8 because of Denver quarterback Bo Nix's strengths and weaknesses. He is 10th in the NFL in yards per dropback against man coverage (7.0) and 24th in the league in yards per dropback vs. zone (5.8). \"You have to watch the tape. Analytics tells you something, but the tape tells you the truth. So we have to really understand that the tape tells us what's going on, but I like to get the analytics first to look at it, to see where it is and then really get the evidence off the tape,\" Eberflus said Thursday. \"Then you see how you can move your defense to fit what they're doing on offense, and then it's really just about the guys executing. ... It's [analytics] a starting point.\"Prediction\nNew York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was able to rack up four total touchdowns (three passing and one rushing) and 294 total yards (283 passing and 11 rushing) against Denver's vaunted defense at Mile High last week. After New York highlighted some soft spots in the Broncos' stout defensive unit in Week 7, Prescott, a 10-year veteran playing MVP-caliber ball, will be able to make more plays than the up-and-down, second-year Denver quarterback in Nix. A long field goal by All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey makes the difference in a narrow Cowboys victory.Pick: Cowboys 27, Broncos 24 | Cowboys +3.5\n            ",

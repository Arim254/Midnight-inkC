    "body": "\n        An Indianapolis judge has set a trial date for former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez, who faces a felony battery charge, among other offenses, after an Oct. 4 incident. Sanchez is accused of seriously injuring a truck driver outside a hotel. Sanchez's trial date has been set for Dec. 11, with another hearing set for Nov. 20 and a pretrial conference date set for Dec. 2, according to The Associated Press.Sanchez, who works as an analyst for Fox Sports, was not required to be at Wednesday's pretrial conference and did not enter a plea, as he was excused from court as he continues to recover from injuries he sustained in the altercation. Sanchez, 38, was accused of starting a fight with a truck driver over a parking spot while under the influence of alcohol, which led to him being stabbed in the upper right torso. The driver was not charged and claimed self-defense.\"Thank you for allowing our client to be excused from today's hearing. He's still recovering from the injuries he sustained,\" defense attorney Tim DeLaney told the judge, per the AP.\n        \n            \n                Mark Sanchez makes statement upon release from hospital following stabbing, arrest\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFollowing the incident, prosecutors charged Sanchez with a felony count of battery involving serious bodily injury, as well as three misdemeanor charges including public intoxication. Sanchez did not address the charges against him when speaking to reporters after being discharged from a local hospital on Oct. 12. He did say he was focused on his recovery process while thanking the first responders and hospital staff that \"saved [his] life.\"\n\"Right now I am just kind of focused on my recovery and I just want to thank the first responders, Eskenazi hospital, Marion County sheriff and the Indianapolis Police Department, metro PD,\" Sanchez said.  \"But I'm focused on my recovery, and I just want to see my wife, I want to see my son, my two baby girls.\"Sanchez remains free on bond and has been permitted by the court to return home to California. \nSanchez, who played in the NFL for 10 years, had been in Indianapolis to serve as an analyst for Fox's broadcast of a game between the Indianapolis Colts and Las Vegas Raiders. He has not worked on any broadcasts for the network since the incident. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Late in the first half of the San Antonio Spurs' season-opening 125-92 blowout win over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday, Victor Wembanyama faced up against P.J. Washington on the right wing. He shot faked. Washington bit. And what Wembanyama did next was, if you didn't actually see it with your own eyes, truly unbelievable. A 7-foot-5 human being took one dribble before launching into a cradling, up-and-under, damn-near double-pump reverse dunk ... in traffic ... on the opposite side of the rim. \"A figment of our basketball imaginations!\" was the early submission for call of the year from ESPN's play-by-play announcer Ryan Ruocco, and honestly, those are the only words that could have come close to sufficing in that moment. It was a perfect call for what might be an honest-to-god perfect basketball player. \nWords like \"unbelievable\" get thrown around in NBA parlance too easily. Usually it's not an actual unbelievable play that's being described -- at least not for athletes of this caliber. But let me tell you something, that was unbelievable. Frankly, Wembanyama's entire night was unbelievable. Dude went for 40 points on 15-for-21 shooting, plus 15 rebounds, three blocks and was a game-high plus-31 in just 29 minutes. \nOf course, we've seen numbers like that before on their own. Combined, however, is another story. Wembanyama is the first player since the 1977-78 NBA/ABA merger to record 40 points and 15 rebounds while shooting 70% from the field with zero turnovers. But forget the numbers. What we saw on Wednesday night can't be quantified on a stat sheet. This was, and is, athletic evolution personified, a human skyscraper snatching shots out of the air like a dinosaur picking fruit -- casually reaching over, and violently dunking on, some of the largest men on the planet as if they were schoolboys, pushing the ball in transition and whipping no-look passes to the corner, all while sinking step-back four-point plays and one-footed kiss shots off the glass and generally operating with the footwork and ball skills of a 6-foot point guard. Before Victor Wembanyama, film like this didn't exist. \nI don't even know where to begin with this, but perhaps I should've have started with the fact that he was doing this against Anthony Davis, maybe the best defensive big man in the world not named Wembanyama. Davis had four fouls in the first half trying to keep up with Wembanyama. He was helpless. If you watched the full highlight reel above then you already saw this, but just in case you didn't, look at this shake down Wemby put on Davis. \nCome on, man. You can't play better defense than that and it didn't matter one bit. I had Wembanyama ranked No. 5 in this season's Top 100 players and that already feels laughably low. It has always been a matter of time until Wembanyama becomes the best player in the world, of course, but nobody thought that time would come this soon. Maybe it hasn't. Maybe this was one game. But maybe not. In fact, I'd lean toward the latter. The marriage of this level of skill with this kind of size is a forgone basketball conclusion. I have never seen anything like this. Nobody has. I don't care if you grew up with Wilt Chamberlain or if you think Ralph Sampson would've been this had he come up in this era.However you slice it, this is entirely new. And the dude is only 21 years old. Unbelievable. Literally, unbelievable. Victor Wembanyama, man. The basketball world is yours. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Emoni Bates appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 15, while LeBron James was featured in Slam Magazine before his junior year of high school. Zion Williamson began going viral for his vicious dunks at 16, and Victor Wembanyama debuted in the EuroCup at 15.But even this century's most-celebrated basketball phenoms failed to find fame as early in life as Mohamed Dabone, who turned 14 years old Tuesday with a physique and skill set so advanced that he's viewed as a potential No. 1 overall pick in an eventual NBA Draft. Dabone, who is already 6-foot-11, is heralded as a fledgling combination of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Victor Wembanyama. A summertime headline in the Wall Street Journal dubbed Dabone, \"The 13-year-old who might be the NBA's next great unicorn.\"Given Dabone was born 2011, it will be 2030 before he's draft eligible. Age, though, is at the center of the story of online hype around Dabone, with many questioning and even seemingly sowing distrust in his Oct. 21, 2011, birthdate. However, CBS Sports has been told his age was verified by European basketball's governing body and gained answers for some of the questions at the center of the rumor mill.\nDabone, a Burkina Faso native, joined FC Barcelona's senior team in Europe's top pro division this season. Though he's playing primarily for the organization's U22 team for now, he logged preseason action with the main team last month, becoming the youngest player to ever play for a EuroLeague squad.Here's one clip of what a 13-year old Dabone did in his first appearance for a Barcelona squad that features several former NBA players on its roster.\nWhy Mohamed Dabone's age is a questionDabone's combination of age and physical gifts (he purportedly owns a 7-4 wingspan) is such an unfathomable pairing that his birthday has become a topic of debate within the basketball universe in places such as the forum and mock draft repository NBA Draft Room. \nThat Dabone hails from a poverty-stricken West African nation only adds to the skepticism over his true age. Burkina Faso ranked 185th of 193 countries in the 2023-24 Human Development Index from the United Nations. Over 25% of the country's roughly 23 million residents lack birth certificates, according to a World Bank study.Skeptics see Dabone's frame and game alongside his age and can't reconcile them. One easy theory is that Dabone was assigned a 2011 birthday by handlers seeking a lucrative finder's fee for introducing a rare phenom to the international basketball community.But CBS Sports has learned there is at least some supporting documentation to back up Dabone's purported birthday. Dabone was able to compete in the May Adidas NextGen session with Barcelona's U18 squad only after passing the organization's age verification procedures, according to a EuroLeague official.\n\"All clubs participating in our competitions are required to submit official documentation for the registration of each player,\" the EuroLeague official told CBS Sports. \"One of the mandatory documents is the player's official passport. Accordingly, the date of birth of Mohamed Dabone published on our website has been taken directly from his passport.\"RealGM, the well-respected online media outlet covering international basketball, used the Adidas NextGen information to build its profile of Dabone. Thus, the Oct. 21, 2011 birthdate for the budding star has become disseminated more widely in recent months.The verification of Dabone's birthdate through a passport comes after a different online profile created suspicion that he may be older than advertised.\nPrior to the EuroLeague's vetting of Dabone's age for the Adidas NextGen event, skeptics latched on to a FIBA 3x3 profile for a \"Dabone Mohamed Samsoundine,\" who has a listed age of 18.  The profile once featured a photo of Dabone but no longer does. It also lists Dabone as being from Togo, which neighbors Burkina Faso to the south. However, a FIBA representative told CBS Sports that anyone can create a profile and enter personal details for the organization's 3x3 platform without providing supporting documentation.\"Only players seeking to compete in FIBA 3x3 Pro Circuit or 3x3 National Team Competitions must undergo a verification process, which includes submitting an official passport,\" the FIBA official said. \"Since Mohamed Dabone has not participated in any of these competitions, his 3x3 profile has not been verified, and FIBA cannot confirm the accuracy of the listed information.\"\nCutting through the clutterIn summary, a passport for Dabone exists and lists his birthday of Oct. 21, 2011. If there is conflicting documentation to suggest that he's actually four years older, it was not provided when that FIBA 3x3 profile was created.Everyone can agree on one thing, though: Dabone is destined for the NBA as soon as he can legally get there. The problem for Dabone is that he'll have to wait so long.Longtime scout Rafael Barlowe, now of the Mavericks, summed up Dabone's situation last year for his website by cutting through the age-related clutter to paint a picture of a future star.\n\"While there is considerable chatter regarding Mohamed Dabone's age, with few believing he was born in 2011, his talent and physical tools are undeniable,\" Barlowe wrote.\nDabone's film suggests the comparisons with Antetokounmpo and Wembanyama aren't far off base. They are all versatile forwards with rare combinations of size and skill. Barlowe identified Dabone as a \"high-ceiling athletic big with tremendous upside\" and noted his strengths as an athletic lob threat and defensive anchor.Given the promise Dabone has already shown, it's likely a disadvantage to him that he must wait until 2030 to be draft-eligible. Dabone will be physically ready much sooner, but he will be forced to delay the beginning of his NBA earnings window until the year he turns 19.\n            ",

In only his 11th appearance for the club, this was Karl's first Bayern Munich goal and one that manager Vincent Kompany will want to be the first of many. Take a look:\nThis appearance in the Champions League was Karl's third start for Bayern in all competitions, and he looked like he belonged, which gives Kompany more options for rotating the squad. Last season, the young winger was with Bayern's U-17s and U-19s but came with the club to the United States for the Club World Cup, making his senior debut, and wouldn't look back. While it was a long summer, things like Karl's integration into Kompany's squad show the value of playing in a competitive club tournament ahead of the preseason. Now, he'll look to have a role in pushing Bayern to win their first Champions League title since the 2019-2020 season. \nAt the end of match day three, the Bavarians sit second behind only Paris Saint-Germain with three wins in three matches, having scored 13 goals and only conceded two. Harry Kane is also joint top of the Golden Boot race with Kylian Mbappe with five goals, but with performances like Karl's, they're getting strong performances from up and down the roster. It's tight at the top of the league phase table, but with depth growing by the day, Bayern Munich are Champions League contenders with this young gun proving he can deliver.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        MILWAUKEE -- Khris Middleton has walked the tunnels of Fiserv Forum hundreds of times. But until he arrived for the Washington Wizards' shootaround on a gray and windy Wednesday morning, hours before the team's season-opening 133-120 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, he had never done so as an opponent. Middleton, who admitted it felt \"weird\" to wake up in a hotel in Milwaukee, said he was \"reminiscing\" as he walked the familiar path to the court he once called home. \"Done great things in here, so it was definitely a moment I got to reflect on a little bit when I got here,\" Middleton said. \"Think about the good times, the bad times, the ups and downs, all of it.\"A second-round pick by the Detroit Pistons back in 2012, Middleton was traded to the Bucks ahead of his second season. At the time, he was considered something of a throw-in in the Brandon Knight for Brandon Jennings swap. Over the 11-plus seasons he spent in Milwaukee, he became much more than that. When the Bucks dealt him to the Wizards ahead of the deadline last season, he left as a franchise icon and one of the most beloved athletes in Milwaukee history. \n\"This place will always be special to me,\" Middleton said. \"I've said it many times: This organization helped me accomplish a lot of my dreams and my goals that I set.\"When Middleton arrived in Milwaukee, the Bucks hadn't won a playoff series since 2001, and were stuck toiling on the treadmill of mediocrity. Together with Giannis Antetokounmpo, he helped transform the franchise into a perennial contender, and in 2021 the duo led the Bucks to their first title since 1971. Middleton made three All-Star appearances with the Bucks and remains second in games played (735), third in points (12,586), seventh in rebounds (3,598), third in assists (2,990), fifth in steals (870) and first in 3-pointers (1,382) on the franchise's all-time leaderboard. \"First of all, I think the most important thing, he should get the warmest welcome ever,\" Antetokounmpo said earlier this week. \"When he comes here and he sees his tribute video, he should be in tears crying before this game. I cannot explain how much Khris means to this team. I cannot explain how much Khris means to me.\"\nThe Bucks' salute to Middleton on Wednesday began prior to the game when Bango and the team's entertainment crew welcomed him with \"For The Love of Money,\" by the O'Jays, which used to blare over the loudspeakers whenever he scored.\"To have that type of welcome before the game was special,\" said Middleton, who admitted he was caught off guard. \nThere were loud cheers when Middleton was introduced in the starting lineup, and an even louder ovation at the first timeout, when his tribute video popped up on the jumbotron. For just over a minute, Middleton's best moments in a Bucks jersey flashed across the screen. As the montage came to an end, the camera panned to Middleton, who stood and waved to the crowd. \n\"I wanted to share my love also,\" Middleton said. \"... To get a standing ovation on the road doesn't happen often, so I wanted to make sure that they knew I acknowledged them, even though I don't really speak too much or do too much, but that really meant a lot. I think that's every player's dream to get a standing ovation, no matter where they're at.\"Over the course of the night, Middleton showed that he can still perform at a high level. He poured in 23 points on 9 of 14 from the field, and chipped in six rebounds and three assists. He even took a charge on Antetokounmpo late in the second quarter. After the game, the former teammates were able to return to being friends and shared a moment at midcourt.  \nAt shootaround, Middleton said his goals for the night were to see more Middleton jerseys in the crowd that Antetokounmpo jerseys and to not become too emotional. He accomplished the latter -- \"Thankful I didn't cry,\" he said postgame -- but there was nothing he could do about the former. Still, there were plenty of No. 22s in the crowd, which he called \"very special.\" \n\"Words really can't describe that part,\" Middleton said. \"That people really spend their money on buying my jersey and wearing it to school, work, out to eat, wherever. That's something I think my family definitely appreciates and loves, and I wish my father could have been here and seen this tonight because I know he would have loved it also.\"Middleton may not have cried, but he said his family did, and they weren't the only ones inside Fiserv Forum on Wednesday with tears in their eyes. That's how much he means to the organization, to the fanbase and to Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo is the better player and the bigger star, but the past decade of Bucks basketball belongs just as much to Middleton. \"I think that's what legacy is all about -- winning,\" Middleton said. \"We built this organization from a team that was struggling to a contender and eventually to a champion, and that's something that should always hold here in this building or wherever else they move is that we won a championship for the city.\"\nWhen Middleton first stepped out of the tunnel and on to the court on Wednesday morning, he said the first thing he went to look at was the championship banner hanging high up in the rafters. Years from now, whenever his career is done, he should be able to return and see his No. 22 right alongside it.  \"It's not up to me. It's up to the people that make that decision,\" Middleton said. \"But yeah, I hope to see that number up there one day. Not any time soon, but that would be great.\"For now, he'll have to settle for the adoration of an entire city. \"I try to get not too caught up in the moment, but the standing ovations are something that's special, something that I really didn't anticipate too much.\" Middleton said. \"To get that type of love and appreciation from the fans, man, that's cool. I think we all picture ourselves as kids waving to 20,000 people and I finally got that moment today.\" \n            ",

Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe will take center stage once again as the focal point of Alonso's version of Los Blancos and already has 14 goals to show for it across all competitions, including five in the Champions League.Real Madrid are one of six teams with two wins out of two to start their Champions League campaigns, the group mostly made up of European titans – Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter and Arsenal – who hope to create further distance between them and the rest. The exception in that group, though, are Qarabag, who notched the first win for an Azerbaijani team in the history of the competition against Benfica and then followed that up with a victory over Copenhagen. Their next test will be against Athletic Club, last season's UEFA Europa League semifinalists who are off to a middling start in both domestic and continental play.For more ahead of a jam-packed Champions League week, here's what you need to know before tuning in.\nHow to watchAll of the action on Matchday 3 of the UEFA Champions League can be caught on Paramount+, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will have select simultaneous coverage.

Kylian Mbappe is expected to lead Los Blancos' offense but Alonso will have a range of options in attack as he looks to fill out the lineup, though the most pressing question of all just might be whether or not Vinicius Junior starts. He got the nod in Real Madrid's 5-0 drubbing of Kairat on Matchday 2 but Alonso lived to regret the decision of leaving him on the bench in their win over Marseille on Matchday 1. The new manager is inclined to rotate through his options so perhaps the fact that Vinicius did not start on Sunday against Getafe means he could be in the lineup against Juventus. \nCan Liverpool turn things around?: Liverpool's strong start to the season is officially a thing of the past, with the Reds becoming the first Premier League champions in 11 years to go on a four game losing streak following their 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. How exactly manager Arne Slot corrects course – and whether or not he can do it in time for their trip to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League – is a big question, especially as it becomes clear that the team's tactical vision for the season is not really working. Their attack has been spotty in recent weeks, either ineffective or wasteful, and the individual players are a bit all over the place – Cody Gakpo has five goals in his last four games for club and country but Florian Wirtz is still struggling to make an impact and Mohamed Salah is off to a poor start. That's without considering the Reds' vulnerable defense, which has been just as costly all season long.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly 30 years ago, Steve Spurrier led Florida Gators to a national title. Now, the Gators are hoping the son of the \"Head Ball Coach\" can help the team's struggling offense for the remainder of the season. Florida interim coach Billy Gonzales told reporters Wednesday that Steve Spurrier Jr. will be more involved in the coaching of sophomore quarterback DJ Lagway in the lead up to the Gators' matchup with No. 5 Georgia on Nov. 1. Spurrier, who was hired as an offensive analyst earlier this year, will have a more hands-on role amid a staff reshuffling following the firing of Billy Napier over the weekend. \"What we're trying to do right now is tweak a couple things so we can put our players in a better situation to go out and make plays and perform at a higher level,\" Gonzales said, per The Associated Press. \"We all understand that's what we need to do. So that's the No. 1 goal for us as a coaching staff right now.\" \n        \n            \n                Steve Spurrier wants Florida coaching search focused on 'proven winner,' cites Lane Kiffin and Eli Drinkwitz\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe 54-year-old Spurrier's most recent coaching stops were at Tulsa (2023-24), Mississippi State (2020-22, Washington State (2018-19), Western Kentucky (2017) and Oklahoma (2016). He also spent a decade worker under his father at South Carolina in a variety of roles, including wide receivers coach, passing game coordinator and co-offensive coordinator. \nA wide receiver at Duke from 1989-1993, Spurrier was a graduate assistant under his father at Florida from 1994-98. During that span, the Gators went 54-8-1 that included a 12-1 record and national title in 1996. The younger Spurrier won his second national title in 2000 during his second of three seasons as Oklahoma's receivers coach under Bob Stoops. He then spent two years in the NFL while working on his father's staff in Washington before returning to the college coaching ranks. Spurrier will now try to help a Gators offense that is currently 105th in the nation in points per per game. He will specifically be tasked with helping Lagway, who has thrown nine touchdowns and an SEC-high nine interceptions during the Gators' first seven games. \n\"Whenever you're around one of the greatest offensive minds in history, it's obviously going to rub off on you as well,\" Gonzales said. \"He's been involved, but now he's going to have more of a role because he's going to be down there on the field with the quarterback looking in his eyes and getting a chance to talk to him and review the film that's being relayed. It's going to put us in a great situation to help DJ and the quarterbacks perform on the football field.\"The Gators improved to 3-4 with a 23-21 home win over Mississippi State last Saturday. \n            ",

At least nine teams will be changing full-time skippers heading into 2026, including the San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants, Atlanta Braves and Baltimore Orioles.The Los Angeles Angels, who let go of both Ron Washington and interim Ray Montgomery, have hired former player Kurt Suzuki as their new skipper. Suzuki spent parts of 16 years in the majors, including his last two with the Angels, and won a World Series ring with the Washington Nationals in 2019.The San Francisco Giants, meanwhile, went out of the box and hired Tennessee coach Tony Vitello to take over for Bob Melvin, who was fired after their season ended. Vitello, who went 341-131 in eight years as head coach at Tennessee, is the first collegiate coach to jump straight to an MLB manager job. He also never played professional baseball.The Texas Rangers became Major League Baseball's first team to complete a managerial change earlier in the month, officially announcing that Skip Schumaker will take over in the dugout. Texas had previously announced a parting of ways with Bruce Bochy, the future Hall of Fame skipper who guided the franchise to its first (and to date only) World Series title in 2023.While there is going to be an unusually large amount of turnover, you shouldn't fret.

As expected, Payton has responded to Wilson calling the Broncos coach \"classless\" on social media -- that, in response to comments Payton made following last Sunday's dramatic, come-from-behind win over the Giants, for whom Wilson is a backup to Jaxson Dart. Wilson clearly took exception to Payton saying that he had hoped the Giants wouldn't have replaced Wilson with Dart until \"long after our game,\" but Payton responded Wedesday that his original comment \"was strictly about Dart\" and \"in no way, shape or form, anything that was directed at Russ.\"\"I might be able to see how he might perceive that, but coming off that win and watching how [Dart] played, that wasn't [my] intention at all,\" Payton said. \nWhile Payton enjoyed a legendary partnership with Drew Brees during their years with the Saints, he and Wilson had one of the ugliest coach-quarterback relationships in NFL history. Even the feud between former Cowboys coach Barry Switzer and QB Troy Aikman looked tame by comparison. \n        \n            \n                Russell Wilson and Sean Payton's feud explained: How years of tension led QB to call his ex-coach 'classless'\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter two tumultuous years together, Payton and Wilson both got want they wanted: a breakup and a fresh start with someone else. Payton has found success again with second-year quarterback Bo Nix, who appears poised to lead the Broncos back to the playoffs for a second straight year. \nConversely, Wilson is trying to find his professional footing after having an up-and-down season in Pittsburgh and losing his job this season in New York to Dart, who appears to be this year's version of Nix. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Week 8 NFL schedule features a compelling slate of matchups across the league, highlighted by several key games that could help shape the NFL playoff picture. The Buffalo Bills are 7.5-point favorites over the Carolina Panthers in what projects as a bounce-back opportunity for Josh Allen and company. In the NFC East, the Philadelphia Eagles host the New York Giants as 7.5-point favorites in a divisional clash that's expected to be physical and low-scoring. 'Sunday Night Football' features the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers in a near-even matchup packed with storylines on both sidelines. The week wraps up with the Kansas City Chiefs heavily favored (-12.5) over the Washington Commanders on 'Monday Night Football,' with Jayden Daniels (hamstring) trending towards missing this game.Effectively building NFL parlay picks can pay off big in your NFL betting strategy.

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys explosive linebacker DeMarvion Overshown is back... at practice. The 25-year-old, who tore his ACL in the 2023 preseason as a rookie and then his ACL again, MCL and PCL on Thanksgiving last year, returned to practice on Wednesday in a limited capacity. Overshown went through individual position drills and then more conditioning with him treating the practices right now as his version of training camp.  \"Ain't God good man. He is. He is. It's a blessing just to be out there. Been watching for 300-plus days now. So when you [are] a guy like me that football is more than just a game to you, it's a way of life, you play with a passion and that energy. When you're able to do it again, you never take it for granted,\" Overshown said.He plans to make his debut as the first Cowboy to wear the jersey No. 0 in a game after Dallas' bye in Week 11 at the Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\"\"That game, I mean, that's what we're looking like. Monday night prime time. Zero will be making his debut. I'm excited for it. It's not going to be anything short of extraordinary,\" Overshown said. \"I'm ready to show truly how blessed I am. A lot of people claim that this knee injury is one of the worst of the worst and not too many people come back the same afterward. I'm ready to put that to the test.\"\nBelieve it or not, Overshown felt like he was capable of moving around and doing everything right as Cowboys training camp kicked off at the end of July. Now, his process is more general conditioning than it is physical therapy-specific workouts. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 8 NFL picks: Cowboys beat Broncos in shootout, Packers spoil Aaron Rodgers' revenge game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Really before training camp. I kind of got an idea of where I should be just from the first knee injury. So once I got to that five, six-month period, it's like 'alright I should be doing a little bit of moving.' Once I start moving around, it's like 'I'm going to be good.' It's a confidence thing and [a] mind thing at that point,\" Overshown said. \"My knee is healed, now it's learning how to run again, learning how to be an NFL football player again. Because you know you don't just wake up and do that overnight after being on a walker. I feel like for about four months I've been comfortable with my knee. It's just been getting into football ready shape.\"Overshown is a player whose game is built around eye-popping athleticism, and he feels like his signature burst will be even better when he does take the field in a live game in November despite returning from a gruesome injury. \n\"I'm stronger, and we've got the numbers to prove it. But stronger, faster, jump higher, more explosive. You name it, I'm all of it. My game, it's not going to slow down. I think one of the worst things I heard over my rehab time was, 'Man, you've got to slow down. We need you to play a full season. You've got to slow down.' But that ain't how I play,\" Overshown said. \"I know how to play one way, and that's 100, full speed and that's all you're going to see. So the knee is stronger than strong.\"    \nThe energy Overshown has already shown in practice and throughout his rehab has caught the eyes of teammates, especially new Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens who can't wait to see Overshown in a game up close for the first time.\"D-Mo is another type of deal that I've never seen, especially at the linebacker position. He can do everything, so I haven't ever seen that -- let alone all the highlights,\" Pickens said Wednesday. \"I'm kind of ready to see it in real time. ... He's got different swag. I told you he's a different type of dude. I'm just waiting to see it in person because it's my first year here.\"\nHow Overshown could provide Parsons-like impact for Dallas' defenseDallas' defense hasn't been nearly as productive pressuring opposing quarterbacks, sacking opposing quarterbacks or in any defensive metric across the board than they have been in years past with All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons being traded away to the Green Bay Packers. The 2025 Cowboys defense under new defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus ranks bottom five in the NFL in multiple defensive metrics including being dead last in total defense (401.6 total yards per game allowed), pass defense (260.3 passing yards per game allowed) and third down defense (51.6% third down conversion rate allowed). It's not entirely surprising given the Cowboys defense had the NFL's highest expected points added (EPA) per play when Parsons was on the field (0.08) from 2021-2024 and the NFL's lowest EPA per play when Parsons was off the field (-0.04) in the same span, per CBS Sports Research.Cowboys defense this seasonStatsNFL RanksPoints per game allowed29.4 29thTotal yards allowed401.6LastYards per play allowed6.130thPass yards per game allowed260.3  LastRush yards per game allowed 141.330thThird-down conversion rate allowed51.6% LastQB pressure rate39.9% 11thSacks15T-14thPasser rating allowed110.6 31stTakeaways6T-23rdZone coverage rate81.9% 4thMan coverage rate13.5% 29thBlitz rate25.4%21stHowever, the Cowboys could see a noticeable uptick in production with his electrifying athleticism back on the field. In Week 1 of the 2024 season at the Cleveland Browns, Overshown's first game back after his first ACL tear, he exploded to sack quarterback Deshaun Watson in 2.8 seconds and beat Parsons to the spot. That blew the All-Pro's mind and had him declaring big things about Overshown's future, saying he would become an All-Pro like him. \n\"I don't even know what happened,\" Parsons said last season. \"I'm going to tell you. I was like, 'Bro, you're gonna have people who think you're faster than me now.' I say, 'I can't take any more breaks. That's what those fresh legs are getting you.' He's [Overshown] so fast. He's explosive, though. I told him after the game how proud I was of him. ... He's coming downhill with intent with everything. He's one of the most exciting players that I've seen. I think he's going to be an All-Pro player.\"  \nSeeing what Overshown can be as a pass rusher, there's already a tried and true method for him to join Parsons in the All-Pro ranks. Like Overshown, Parsons began his career playing primarily out of the inside linebacker spot, 55.2% of his snaps as a rookie according to Pro Football Focus. Micah Parsons' Cowboys defensive snap alignment, 2021-2023202120222023Defensive Line41.3%81.1%87.2%Linebacker55.2%18.1%12.7%Defensive Back3.5%0.8%0.1%*Data according to Pro Football FocusIf Dallas were to ease Overshown into playing more as an edge rusher along the line of scrimmage, there's a chance that type of positional switch could lead to similar results to Parsons' given both have elite athleticism. Overshown also has enough knowledge of Eberflus' playbook after attaching himself at the hip to the DC and taking charge in team meetings. It's a change the Cowboys' edge rusher group needs: Dallas' top two leaders in quarterback pressures through seven weeks are their two defensive tackles, Kenny Clark (23) and Osa Odighizuwa (20).\"I'm just going to do what I know I can do. When I get in between those lines, the sky's the limit for me. I'm not saying that to be cocky or anything, but I know what I bring to the field,\" Overshown said. \"Hearing things and seeing like, 'Oh, we need D-Mo to be this when he comes back,' or 'We need D-Mo to do this,' I am not worried about [that]. I know what I bring to the table. I know what y'all saw last year and I know y'all going to get more of that. So it's really no stress and no pressure on me to go back out and do anything. I know what I'm capable of. Last year was still me just getting my feet wet, so still really [we] haven't seen what all I can do.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Big 12 has been the most unpredictable conference in college football over the past several years, and the title race is once again up in the air. Prohibitive favorite Texas Tech lost a stunner against Arizona State, opening the door for several others.Heading into the month of November last year, there were nine Big 12 teams technically alive for the Big 12 title because of tiebreakers. Four teams tied for first place at the end of the year, with Arizona State beating out Iowa State for a Big 12 title and College Football Playoff appearance. It's worth noting the conference has produced a brand-new participant in the Big 12 Championship Game in seven of the last eight years. Four of the five teams with one or fewer losses in conference play would be first-time participants. The Big 12 chaos wheel keeps turning. Here's how we handicap every school in the Big 12 title race, from top contenders to bottom of the barrel. \n\n        \n            \n                CBS Sports 136: Texas A&M, Alabama rise into top five amid shakeup in college football rankings\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe top contendersTexas Tech (6-1, 3-1): Despite looking mortal in a loss to Arizona State last week, Texas Tech remains the team to beat in the Big 12. The defensive line has exceeded all expectations as linebackers David Bailey and Jacob Rodriguez both earned Midseason All-America honors. With quarterback Behren Morton healthy, this is still the best team in the Big 12, but he needs to get healthy. BYU (7-0, 4-0): The Cougars have played one of the easiest schedules in the Big 12, but a win over Utah last weekend vaulted them into the top group. There's a marquee matchup with Texas Tech on Nov. 8 and road trips to Iowa State and Cincinnati, but even 1-2 in those games should be enough to reach Arlington. Arizona State (5-2, 3-1): The Sun Devils' 2025 season is eerily similar to their 2024 campaign, down to losing big without quarterback Sam Leavitt in the lineup. However, Leavitt's 319-yard return against Texas Tech helps push them back towards the contender pile with only one loss. The schedule is tricky from here on out, but not impossible, and the tiebreaker against Texas Tech is huge. While Texas Tech remains the prohibitive betting favorite on FanDuel, the Sun Devils now have the second-best odds to win the Big 12.\nJust need one breakCincinnati (6-1, 4-0): The Bearcats have been the surprise team of the Big 12 season, and perhaps belong in the top group. Cincinnati was a near-comeback against Nebraska away from an undefeated start. The trenches have been the star of the show, led by All-American Dontay Corleone and FCS transfer Joe Cotton. Games against Baylor and Utah in the next two weeks can cement their contender status. Utah (5-2, 2-2): The Utes are a high quality team, perhaps third-best in the Big 12. The problem? The Utes have tiebreaking losses to both Texas Tech and BYU through the first seven games, along with a matchup remaining against No. 21 Cincinnati. Tiebreaker math just isn't on their side. Houston (6-1, 3-1): Willie Fritz wins everywhere he goes, but he has outdone himself with this instant rebuild at Houston. The Cougars have already clinched their first bowl trip since joining the Big 12, and have plenty of potential wins left on the schedule. That said, Houston has been a little streaky offensively, but there's another level there. \nIowa State (5-2, 2-2): After a fantastic start, the Cyclones lost head-scratching road games against Cincinnati and Colorado in recent weeks. Now, they play No. 11 BYU, No. 24 Arizona State and on the road against TCU in the next three games. It's a frustrating way to whiff on what could have been a historic season. Outside looking inTCU (5-2, 2-2): The Horned Frogs' inconsistency has reared its head over the past few weeks, including a 13-point loss to Kansas State on the road. The schedule ahead has many pitfalls, including at No. 11 BYU, Iowa State and No. 21 Cincinnati. The Frogs likely still control their own destiny, but it's a rough road. Baylor (4-3, 2-2): Baylor has underwhelmed after lofty expectations to start the year, and needed strokes of luck just to outlast SMU and Kansas State. A struggling defensive line has led to them ranking amongst the worst defensive units in college football, but a stacked offense at least gives them a chance every week. \nKansas State (3-4, 2-2): Beating UCF served as a get-right game, and the Wildcats have turned things on over the last three games. But the early season woes are still dragging Kansas State down, and a blocked 57-yard field goal against Baylor prevents them from having a realistic path to contention. Kansas (4-3, 2-2): Quarterback Jalon Daniels has been everything that was promised, but the defense has cost the Jayhawks games. There are plenty of 50-50 games ahead, but none are more important than the Sunflower Showdown against Kansas State this week. Working through thingsArizona (4-3, 1-3): Outside of a game against Oklahoma State, the Wildcats have played a brutal Big 12 schedule. Even still, they beat Kansas State in nonconference and played BYU and Houston to within six points. The Wildcats are a much more competent football team in 2025 under Brent Brennan, and the resurgence of Noah Fifita has been a welcome change. \nColorado (3-4, 1-3): The Buffaloes have been inconsistent, but the team has been well coached and given themselves a chance in every game. Colorado shocked Iowa State and took BYU to the wire. The schedule is brutal, but a bowl game could be in sight. UCF (4-3, 1-3): The Knights have shown some promising signs under first-year coach Scott Frost. The headliner was a 45-13 decimation of lowly West Virginia, but close games against Cincinnati and Kansas show that the program has clearly taken a step. Assuming a win against Oklahoma State, they just need to pull an upset against Baylor or Houston to return to the postseason. Battle for lastWest Virginia (2-5, 0-4): Rich Rodriguez got his revenge against Pittsburgh in Week 3, and the wheels have fully flown off since. The Mountaineers have been outscored by 111 points in four Big 12 games, including a 45-13 loss to UCF last week. If the Mountaineers finish winless, it will be the first such conference campaign for WVU since 1960. \nOklahoma State (1-6, 0-4): The Cowboys are comically bad, but the vibes have gone up tremendously under interim coach Doug Meacham. According to SP+, the Cowboys rank behind FCS Monmouth and just ahead of Division II Ferris State in quality. Neat! \n            ",

    "body": "\n        PHILADELPHIA -- Brandon Graham entered the locker room at the NovaCare Complex ready to congregate with the hordes of media surrounding his locker. Entering his 16th season in the NFL, Graham walked over and smiled before taking his first comments. \"Ya'll ain't gonna let me take my pads off first!,\" Graham said with his infectious smile.Graham waited a long time to have that scrum swarmed around his locker, one day after announcing he was coming back to play for the Eagles for another season. The vibe around the locker room had some extra pep with Graham coming back, as players across the locker room could hear Graham's voice all over the practice field.It didn't take long for Graham to do what he does best.\n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 8 NFL picks: Cowboys beat Broncos in shootout, Packers spoil Aaron Rodgers' revenge game\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"I don't feel too far off honestly,\" Graham said of his first practice back with the Eagles. \"I feel good. Now, it's just about being able to talk my trash and work. After like four plays I was like, oh yeah, let me get out and [talk my trash], it's over with.\"\nBack like he never left Even though Graham retired in March, the seeds were planted for him to return at some point. Graham thought he still had some \"juice\" left, knowing he wasn't done with the game he's dedicated his whole life to. Hard to blame Graham, considering the way last season was going before his triceps injury. Graham was having a strong season before tearing his triceps last November, leading him to be out for the rest of the season -- unless the Eagles made Super Bowl LIX. The Eagles did make Super Bowl LIX and Graham was able to play 13 snaps before tearing his triceps again.That was it, right? Graham was going to walk off a Super Bowl champion and never look back. \n\"That storybook can still be there, but reality set in,\" Graham said. \"I still had the urge. I felt like I was still on my game last year. Still felt like I could help the team. If I didn't feel like that, I wouldn't be back. Howie [Eagles general manager Howie Roseman] wouldn't have picked me up if that wasn't the case.\"Graham had the urge to play another season, yet was okay if it wasn't meant to be. He still went to the NovaCare Complex and worked out like he would if he was still playing, just in case if that call came. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio was also in Graham's ear about returning, giving him subtle hints he wanted him back. \"He kept hitting me up, he kept sending me videos and stuff. It was cool,\" Graham laughed. \"He'd be like, you know how you can change this, because my locker room was in the staff locker room, he'd be like are you sure you like this locker? The other locker has more space.\"\nIf there was pressure coming for a return, it wasn't from Graham. He was going to wait until the Eagles called him, biding his time and working out at the NovaCare Complex in case the phone rang. Not long after Za'Darius Smith abruptly retired last week, opportunity arose. \"I wanted to stay on the (workout) schedule while I'm still doing media and all that. I knew after this season if I wasn't coming back, I would have took some time away after that,\" Graham said. \"I was just getting used to not playing and I got that call, and of course I wanted to entertain it. \"I felt like I had some juice left.\"Was Graham really retired?Graham was on the reserve/retirement list by the NFL, yet his former and future teammates couldn't tell the difference. Seen frequently with Jason Kelce working out in the NovaCare Complex, Graham would pop his head in with the players and check in on them.\nThe Eagles never specified a role they had for Graham, and Graham wasn't really sure what he exactly wanted to do either outside of media opportunities. He was hoping the Eagles didn't need him, which is why Graham retired in the first place. Rest assured, Graham did want to come back. \"I walk in, he's watching film just like us,\" said Eagles pass rusher Joshua Uche. \"I just felt like football is one thing that I feel like BG can never get away from. \"Being retired I figured he'd be a coach or something, so when he wasn't coaching I'm, like, all right, something might be up.\"\nGraham even admitted he got advice from Kelce and Fletcher Cox about how the body changes after the football days are done, making sure you keep the routine going in case there was a chance at returning. Kelce was done with football and so was Cox -- but Graham wasn't. Whether it was lifting or working on football-related stuff, Graham made sure he stayed ready in case the Eagles called him. If he wasn't doing that, he was helping out the Eagles' players. Potentially getting ready for a post-playing career. \"He's someone whose always gonna be around the game,\" Uche said. \"But he was doing those podcasts, commentating, so he was around the game, but I feel like he's hands on so to get him back on the field with us, back in the room with us it's just like having a second coach, too, right there helping everybody out.\"\nA new endingGraham had everything he needed to cap off a football career. Already having a Super Bowl ring and making arguably the greatest play in franchise history (strip sack of Tom Brady), Graham walked off the field in Super Bowl LIX a champion. Two Super Bowl rings and having your final game end up in a championship. What could be better? \"When you think about it. When Tom Brady and all them boys came back you still say he got seven rings. He's still gonna tell the story,\" Graham said. \"So it was like man, if I still feel like I can play, why not?\"\nGraham still has that legacy incorporated with the Eagles franchise. That isn't going away because he wanted to play football for a 16th season. A 5-2 start and a chance to repeat certainly helped make the decision to return easier. \"I feel like we got a good team, too,\" Graham said. \"That's another thing. If the team wasn't good I'd be like I'm sorry, I gotta go. But do feel like we have an opportunity of a lifetime right now with these people on the team, how we've done a great job putting this team together. \n\"I still feel like I have a duty to come in here and help. Because I still feel like I have some juice left.\"The way the Eagles keep winning, Graham may be back for year 17, too. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Opening night isn't a completely accurate look into how an NBA season is going to progress. Last year, the Hornets beat the Rockets on the road, for instance, and both of the Tuesday matchups were won by teams that would eventually lose to those same opponents in the playoffs -- the Lakers to the Timberwolves and the Celtics to the Knicks. But it very often offers us our first true glimpse into the trends and storylines that ultimately wind up defining a given season. Sure enough, a year ago the Cleveland Cavaliers dropped 136 points in a 30-point decimation of the Toronto Raptors, for instance. They had the best offense in the league across a 64-win season while the Raptors tanked. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander beat Nikola Jokić on the road and then took his MVP award. Opening night is the first real opportunity for players and teams to show the world what they spent the summer working toward. Sometimes it takes a while, as it did for the Rockets. Sometimes it's immediate, as it was for the Cavaliers.We have a whole season to offer measured takes on reliable samples. Opening night is for overreactions. So let's go through each of these games in search of one extreme takeaway. Will any of these pan out? Well, if last year is any indication, some of them will, and others will look ridiculous. This is the NBA. It's an ever-changing league, and it's better to be too early on these changes than too late.NBA opening night overreactionsMavericks-Spurs: Victor Wembanyama is the best player in the worldLook past the numbers for a moment. I know that's going to be difficult on a night in which Wembanyama scored 40 points, pulled in 15 rebounds, blocked three shots and made over 70% of his shots, but his stat lines are always gaudy.\nWhat we saw on Wednesday was different.This was no longer a baby bird spreading its wings. This was a dragon laying waste to any who would dare oppose him. The entire theory of the Dallas Mavericks was to build a team so gigantic that nobody could score against it. Wembanyama made it look easy. How many 7-5 centers have you ever seen pump fake into a drive that ended in a reverse dunk? How about blocking an opposing center on one end and then crossing him up for a four-point play on the other?\nHe's running the floor like a small forward now, but he's added enough bulk to bully centers. When Anthony Davis is so lost against you that he has no option but to foul, you know you're doing something right. Maybe Nikola Jokić is still more valuable. Maybe Shai Gilgeous-Alexander hoists the trophy again at the end. But Victor Wembanyama's season 3 premiere made the impossible look routine. No one else on Earth can do what he does. If he isn't the best player in the NBA today, he will be in the very near future.Timberwolves-Trail Blazers: Minnesota is still light on playmakingYes, the Timberwolves won, and yes, Anthony Edwards was spectacular with 41 points, but this game was closer than the Timberwolves likely suspected in part because this team remains light on playmaking. They assisted on only half of their 42 field goals and committed 19 turnovers. With Donte DiVincenzo replacing Mike Conley in the starting lineup and Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr. expected to take on bigger roles this season, the Timberwolves are seemingly moving away from traditional point guards. Yes, 41 points from Edwards are nice. He's capable of playing hero. But given the construction of this roster, the Timberwolves need more than one assist out of Edwards if they're going to get by the many Western Conference teams that are better than the Blazers.\nKings-Suns: Signing Russell Westbrook was a mistakeIt's a bit cliche to blame Russell Westbrook, especially after a single game. The problem here is less what he did on the court, though a 2-of-8 shooting night in 19 minutes was hardly encouraging. The issue here is what he does to Sacramento's roster. He got on the floor before Keon Ellis, the only reliable defender the Kings have, and that in turn limited Ellis to only 13 minutes. Meanwhile, the Kings closed their loss to the Suns with Dylan Caldwell, a two-way player, at center. Westbrook's slot on the team probably should have gone to a defensive-minded big man. The roster is enormously unbalanced. They have too many players who need the ball and not enough frontcourt players to do the dirty work. Westbrook's reputation affords him playing time that this specific roster needs to be spending elsewhere. Clippers-Jazz: The Clippers are too oldThe Clippers built the oldest roster in NBA history this offseason, and they likely felt justified in doing so because of how well their older players fared a year ago. James Harden was an All-Star and Kawhi Leonard looked like his peak self down the stretch, so they added Chris Paul, Bradley Beal and Brook Lopez to their basketball remake of The Expendables. Well, what happened when they tipped off on Wednesday? They were run off the floor by the younger, more athletic Jazz.The Clippers scored just eight fast break points in defeat, and the starting trio of Leonard, Beal and Harden combined for only 30 points. Aside from Derrick Jones Jr., there isn't much athleticism to speak of here. The Clippers need to out-execute opponents largely on skill, and if there is any slippage whatsoever from where those players were a year ago, that's going to be very tough. They came out completely flat on opening night, and if that's a sign of where they are physically now, things are only going to get harder in the dog days of the schedule.\nBulls-Pistons: Detroit doesn't have enough shootingMalik Beasley, as a reserve, was responsible for more than 30% of Detroit's made 3-pointers last season. To put that number into perspective, Stephen Curry was responsible for around 32% of Golden State's 3-pointers in 2021, the year he played without Klay Thompson. The Pistons hoped that Duncan Robinson would be enough to replace his shooting, but Robinson hasn't made 40% of his 3s since 2021 and he missed all five of his attempts on Wednesday. Robinson is virtually unplayable when his shots don't go in, but the Pistons have no choice.Considering how much they have invested in Ausar Thompson and Jalen Duren, who are non-shooters, they need Robinson to space the floor properly. They got the worst of both worlds on Wednesday, as Robinson did little for their offense while suffering defensively. Meanwhile, Cade Cunningham spent the game driving into traffic en route to an 8-of-24 shooting performance. The Pistons are at least one shooter short right now, but given how historic Beasley was a year ago, even that might not be enough to lift this offense.Grizzlies-Pelicans: Ja Morant will return to the All-Star GameJa Morant more or less lost the 2023-24 season to injuries and suspension. He was back on the court last season, but injuries continued to weaken him, and so did a revamped offense that all but removed the pick-and-roll. His 11.4 paint points per game and 6.4 free throw attempts per game both represented meaningful dips from his 2022 peak, when he made his first All-Star Game. But with Tuomas Iisalo now locked in as head coach and an offseason of recovery behind him, Morant put up 20 paint points and eight free-throw attempts against the Pelicans on Wednesday, en route to 35 points on the night.\nEverything Morant does offensively flows out of his ability to get to the basket and get to the line, and Iisalo has reconfigured the offense to maximize his opportunities to do so. This version of Morant is an All-Star, and if he can play like this when half of his team is injured, he'll only get stronger as the season progresses.Bucks-Wizards: Khris Middleton is back!The Bucks are ineligible for any overreactions by virtue of having played the Wizards. We're not even going to pretend to take anything away from their opening performance. But a former Buck that was on the other side Wednesday? That's fair game. Can you guess the last time Khris Middleton scored 23 points in an NBA game? I'm almost certain you can't, because it wasn't even last season. No, it was Game 4 of Milwaukee's five-game loss to Indiana in the 2024 postseason.\n        \n            \n                Khris Middleton shows love to Bucks fans in return to Milwaukee: 'I think that's every player's dream'\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA variety of injuries tore Middleton down to the point that he was essentially just salary filler in the Kyle Kuzma trade last February. But Middleton looked healthier than he has in quite some time with his 9-of-14 shooting performance against the Bucks on Wednesday. He can't get to the rim like he used to, but he looked comfortable finding his patented mid-range looks against the Bucks, and if that persists, he immediately becomes a pretty interesting trade or buyout candidate come midseason.\nHawks-Raptors: Toronto can build a viable offense without shootingThe 2024-25 Toronto Raptors never scored more than 133 points in a game. They scored 138 on opening night this season, and here's the kicker: They only shot 7-of-25 from 3-point range. This is Toronto in a nutshell. Dating back to the Nick Nurse years, they always lagged behind in shooting and playmaking, but made up for it by getting to the basket and scoring in transition. The Raptors had 34 fastbreak points on Wednesday to go along with 86 points in the paint. This is a weird group of players, and one that will probably need some mixing and matching from a lineup perspective. But they're big, athletic, and relentless defensively. They'll generate enough easy offense on that alone to survive, even if the shooting never quite comes around.76ers-Celtics: Philadelphia belongs to the guards nowJoel Embiid played 20 minutes, scored four points against arguably the NBA's thinnest front court and ultimately got benched for crunch time. His movement looked completely compromised. It should be panic time in Philadelphia, except VJ Edgecombe and Tyrese Maxey just announced themselves as perhaps the most unguardable backcourt in the NBA.\n        \n            \n                Joel Embiid looks like a shell of himself during 20 painful minutes in 76ers' season-opening win vs. Celtics\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe pair combined to make 12 3-pointers on the way to their 74 points, and that shooting makes their elite speed that much more lethal. Philadelphia's big man may be slow and relatively unathletic at this stage of his career, but the 76ers can build a new identity around their backcourt's skill and dynamism. A star was born in Edgecombe on Wednesday, and Maxey reaffirmed that status for himself after an injury-plagued tanking year.\nKnicks-Cavaliers: Mike Brown and Leon Rose fixed the benchIf Tom Thibodeau had his way, his teams would rely on only five players. Maybe four. Luol Deng can play two positions at once, right? Mike Brown was hired in part to make the most of a bench built with limited resources, and he did just that in their 119-111 win against Cleveland. The Knicks used 11 players against the Cavaliers on Wednesday, and with Mitchell Robinson and Josh Hart injured, that meant every player with a standard contract except Pacôme Dadiet and Mohamed Diawara saw real action. The result? The Knicks got 35 points from their bench after averaging a league-low (by a country mile) 21.7 a year ago.\nEvery reserve except Landry Shamet had a positive plus-minus. Ariel Hukporti stood out starting in Robinson's place early on thanks to his energy and rebounding, but just about everyone did their part for the Knicks in their season-opening victory.Magic-Heat: Orlando will end its 13-year streak as a bottom-10 offenseDeath, taxes and bad Orlando offense. The Magic have ranked in the bottom 10 offensively 13 years in a row. That's what compelled their offseason blockbuster for Desmond Bane, and against a stout Miami defense, Bane absolutely delivered. His 23 points obviously helped, but really, just having a threatening shooter on the floor changed everything for this offense. After ranking 24th in the NBA with 45.8 paint points per game a season ago, the Magic dropped 56 on a Heat frontline led by star defender Bam Adebayo. If Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero can take the next step with this newfound space, the Magic won't just avoid the bottom-10, they might even sneak into the top 10.\nHornets-Nets: Charlotte has its centersThe Hornets traded Mark Williams twice and Nick Richards once, and to the naked eye, it looked like they just didn't seek viable replacements. Well, it turns out, they've managed to fill the position for pennies on the dollar. Second-round rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner and former two-way player Moussa Diabaté combined to give Charlotte 23 points, 20 rebounds and three blocks in their 136-117 win over the Nets. Diabaté was a plus-minus darling on the defensive end a year ago, and Kalkbrenner won four consecutive Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards, so while they were pretty unheralded by typical NBA standards, the Hornets were justified in betting on them. That bet paid off on Wednesday. At least for now, they can roll forward with this duo.Thunder-Rockets: Alperen Sengun is an MVP candidateIt's been burbling all summer, especially at EuroBasket, where he drew comparisons to Nikola Jokić. Well, Tuesday was proof of concept. Alperen Sengun was for large stretches the best player on a court with Kevin Durant and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, ultimately scoring 39 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in the Houston loss. He made a career-high five 3-pointers -- he'd previously topped out at three, and even that was a rarity. His finishing at the rim was a bit suspect last season, but he made four of his five restricted area shots against the Thunder. He led both teams with seven assists, no small feat considering he's playing on a roster with very little ball-handling or shooting.\n        \n            \n                Rockets haunted by glaring lack of point guard competence in season-opening defeat\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWe came into the season not knowing how Houston's offense would fare without Fred VanVleet. Tuesday gave us our answer: Through Sengun, and it's going to vault him into some very lofty conversations.\nLakers-Warriors: Not even skinny Luka can fix this rosterHere's a distressing statistic: 97 of the 109 points scored by the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday were scored or assisted on by Luka Dončić or Austin Reaves. Not great. Neither is a home loss when your best player has a 43-point, 12-rebound, nine-assist stat line. The Lakers shot 8-of-32 from deep, distressing in percentage of course, but also in volume given how much JJ Redick has talked about hoisting 3s.\n        \n            \n                The Lakers keep making the same mistakes, but now the stakes are higher than ever for Rob Pelinka\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe perimeter defense was a mess, fouling Jimmy Butler constantly and doing little to impede Stephen Curry's movement. Deandre Ayton's debut was everything Blazers and Suns fans warned it could be. He demanded the ball too much, didn't get to the line, didn't rebound and didn't really mix it up near the basket much at all. Getting LeBron James back will help, but if the Lakers can't get the role players right, no amount of star power will matter.\n            ",

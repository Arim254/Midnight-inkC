Both teams are facing squads coming off Monday games, with Cincy 2.5-point favorites versus Miami, per the latest Week 16 NFL lines, while Detroit is -7 against Pittsburgh. While every team appreciates having a rest advantage, not every team makes the most of it per NFL spread records.Since 2023, no team has more ATS wins with a rest edge than Detroit (nine), while Cincy's 2-6 ATS record with a rest advantage is the third-worst in football over that span.

This is arguably a tougher test for Dallas than others they didn't pass the past two weeks.

Both squads are 11-3, though L.A. defeated Seattle earlier this year as the Rams are the only NFC team that has already clinched a playoff berth. Los Angeles is a 1.5-point road favorite, however it is expected to be without Davante Adams, who leads the league with 14 touchdown receptions. SportsLine's Larry Hartstein is 27-10-1 (+1601) over his last 38 ATS picks in Rams games and is backing Los Angeles (+1.5) to cover.\"While the Rams' offense has hit another gear, thanks to the emergence of their young tight ends and running back Blake Corum, Seattle's offense has not impressed in its last two home games,\" said Hartstein. \"The Seahawks averaged 3.8 yards per carry over their last three games. That's putting more of an onus on Sam Darnold. While Darnold can tear apart secondaries when he's not pressured, he is extremely susceptible to a strong pass rush. The Rams rank eighth with 37 sacks. Seattle's defense is top-notch and won't make it easy on Matthew Stafford, but I like the Rams in a 27-20 type of game.\" Get more Seahawks vs Rams picks here.\n            ",

This is the rubber match between the franchises as their all-time series is tied 28-28 after the Rams won their Week 11 matchup. Seattle (11-3) is coming off an 18-16 victory over Indianapolis on Sunday, marking the team's fourth straight victory. L.A. has won two in a row, most recently defeating Detroit, 41-34, in Week 15, which clinched a playoff berth for the Rams. Seattle would lock up a postseason spot with a victory. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in Seattle. L.A. has won four of the last five overall matchups, as well as four of the last five meetings in Seattle. The latest Seahawks vs. Rams odds have Seattle as 1.5-point road favorites, while the over/under for total points is 43.5. Before making any Rams vs. Seahawks picks, make sure to check out the 'Thursday Night Football' predictions from SportsLine NFL expert Larry Hartstein.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Matthew Stafford going Over 230.5 passing yards yards. Bet it at DraftKings right here:\nA former lead writer for Covers and The Linemakers, Hartstein combines a vast network of Vegas sources with an analytical approach he honed while working for Pro Football Focus. Hartstein tied for 52nd place (out of 1,598 entries) in the 2022 Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest, going 53-34-3 ATS. He is coming off a down 2024 NFL season at SportsLine that puts him at 967-821 all-time on NFL sides and props (plus 13.8 units), including 593-518 ATS.

They have won seven of the last 10 games, while covering in eight of those contests. The Rams defense flustered Sam Darnold into four interceptions in Los Angeles' Week 11 win, which is Darnold's most picks since his infamous \"seeing ghosts\" game in 2019. While both teams rank in the top five in both scoring offense and scoring defense, the biggest difference between the two lies in giveaways and takeaways. Los Angeles' +9 turnover differential ranks in the top five of the NFL, while Seattle has a -1 mark as it's committed the second-most turnovers (23) in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine, and bet Darnold to go Over 0.5 passing interceptions at DraftKings here:\nWhy the Seahawks can coverA major component of L.A.'s offense is expected to be out as Davante Adams (hamstring), who leads the league in receiving touchdowns is doubtful to play. That will make things easier for an already elite defense, as Seattle is No. 2 in points allowed and allows the fewest yards per pass attempt and second-fewest yards per rush attempt. The Seahawks are equally as potent through the air on offense as they are in defending the pass on defense, as Seattle leads the NFL in yards per pass attempt. Thus, it connects on big passing plays like no other team, and the Rams' defense is exploitable in that area. L.A. just allowed its second-most passing yards (326) of the season in Week 15, while the Rams gave up their most points of the year (34) in that contest. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks picksHartstein has analyzed Seahawks vs. Rams from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

    "body": "\n        Shocking news broke in college football on Wednesday, Dec. 10, when Michigan fired head coach Sherrone Moore for cause, according to a statement from Athletic Director Warde Manuel. Moore went 16-8 in two seasons as the head coach in Ann Arbor after taking over for Jim Harbaugh. Michigan improved in Year 2 under Moore and had high hopes for the future with former top-ranked quarterback Bryce Underwood leading the offense. Now the Michigan coaching search is unfolding with many top names from this cycle already off the board. Who are the top names on the Michigan hot board?

Dillingham, an Arizona State alum, took over as head coach at ASU in 2023 and is 22-16 overall, including an 11-3 run in 2024 that included a College Football Playoff berth.His age (35) could be an issue for a huge program like Michigan, but TMI's Sam Webb says that's won't necessarily be a deterrent. \n\"Talk of his age being a deterrent merely because of the negative outcome with Sherrone Moore is overblown,\" Webb said. \"Bobby Petrino is an older coach who had a similar transgression, and he's much older. So, Michigan is looking at poor judgment as a function of age. The only thing Dillingham's age speaks to relative to the rest of the field is his experience.\" See more candidates at TheMichiganInsider.How to get insider Michigan coaching search updates The rest of the list includes several other exciting possibilities, including a coach who is in the College Football Playoff field \"who is the hottest name on the list.\" You can only see who it is by joining TheMichiganInsider.Who are the top names in the Michigan football coaching search, and which playoff coach could Michigan take a big swing on?

    "body": "\n        Jalen Brunson was so excited for his teammates that he couldn't bother waiting for a question on the stage after his New York Knicks won the NBA Cup on Tuesday. \"OG Anunoby, Tyler Kolek, Jordan Clarkson, Mitchell Robinson,\" Brunson listed, ignoring Taylor Rooks' first question after winning his MVP trophy. \"They played their ass off tonight. Without them, we don't win this. They played their ass off tonight.\"It was a special moment for a team that's increasingly starting to feel special. Brunson has spent his entire Knicks tenure as the offensive engine, but at their worst, those Knicks too often defaulted to watching him dribble and hoping for hero ball. This year's team has found balance. New York is averaging 296.1 passes per game this season, their highest figure of the Brunson era by far and around 15 above where they were a season ago. Everyone here is eating. Brunson may be averaging a career-high 28.8 points per game, but six Knicks average in double figures. Anunoby, Mikal Bridges and Josh Hart are all flirting with career-best efficiency. Karl-Anthony Towns has traded a couple of shots for some the best defense of his career. The bench is more involved than Tom Thibodeau ever allowed it to be. There's a reason Brunson called out Kolek, who played less than 300 minutes last season. He played a career-high 20 minutes and 27 seconds, and the Knicks won those minutes by 14 points. He took an opportunity the old Knicks never would have given him and made the most of it.The team results speak for themselves. They have the best net rating in the Eastern Conference by a mile and are currently on a 59-win pace even despite injuries and adjustments to Mike Brown's new scheme. All of this together suggests, at the very least, meaningful growth from the clunky team that was still fumbling for lineup ideas in the Eastern Conference finals last spring. They're not perfect. But they've found the best version of their team, the one that maximizes the cohesion among all the considerable talent they've assembled. That's not something to be trifled with lightly.\nAnd it's something that may never have happened had Giannis Antetokounmpo been a bit more assertive in his long-term desires. We know through reporting that Giannis indicated to the Bucks that he was open to a trade over the summer. We know the Knicks and Bucks held at least preliminary discussions, and that an offer was presented. We don't know who exactly was in it, but we can surmise purely through salary-matching rules that it would have included at least two of Bridges, Anunoby and Towns along with perhaps more depth.But Antetokounmpo didn't force the issue. He's reportedly uncomfortable with the idea of a firm trade request, and the Bucks are taking advantage of that to delay the inevitable. So a trade that probably should have come last summer still hasn't happened. It may not happen all season. And given where we sit today, that's probably in New York's best interest.\n        \n            \n                The Bucks are seemingly resisting Giannis Antetokounmpo trade talks, so is there a win-now move to make?\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's not to say that the Knicks shouldn't trade for Giannis if given the chance. It's just that doing so would create questions they may not have answers for. How would they replace the depth they lost in the trade? How would the incumbent players -- acquired to play on a specific sort of team -- adjust to playing in a very different sort of system with very different needs? How many eggs do the Knicks want to put in one basket when, right now, they're winning by spreading the wealth?\nThose aren't the sort of questions teams like to answer on the fly. Think of the Lakers after acquiring Luka Dončić last February. They were of course right to go through with the trade, but Rob Pelinka would later describe the fallout as \"trying to build an airplane in the sky.\" They lost in the first round in five games because they had little ability to put a proper roster around him with less than a week to go until the deadline. This year's Laker team is meaningfully better.So Milwaukee's present hesitance likely suits the Knicks just fine. It gives them plenty of time to answer any questions they already have before considering the ones that would arise after a trade. The Knicks are Eastern Conference favorites here and now (+240 at Caesars). They'd be underdogs against whoever comes out of the West, but they'd probably like to know for certain where they stand against the Thunder or whoever beats them before they consider blowing up one of the best rosters in team history. The longer this drags out, the more they'll know about what they have.And, frankly, the less they'll probably have to pay for what comes next. If Antetokounmpo makes it to the offseason in Milwaukee, the ball is almost entirely in his court. With only a single year remaining on his contract at that point, he'll have the power to scare off any undesirable suitors. If the Knicks are indeed what he wants, and he's what they want, he can simply tell other interested parties that he will not sign an extension and that will be that. With so many imposing teams looming with 2027 cap space -- most notably the Lakers -- the threat of him walking away from whatever team tries to rent him is very real.\nThese things can change at the drop of a hat. When the Bucks last took the floor, they lost by 45 to the Nets. They might reach their breaking point soon, or Antetokounmpo could. But for now, with Houston and San Antonio reportedly sitting out talks and no direct impetus from Giannis, it is growing increasingly likely that his future is settled over the summer rather than before the deadline.And after lifting their first trophy in over 50 years, well, that's probably in New York's best interest. This team is steadily proving that it deserves a chance to lift the more famous trophy that comes at the end of June. When that question is answered, they'll know how seriously they should consider a Giannis pursuit. Until then, the NBA Cup was a statement by both Brunson and his teammates. The whole here is more important than the sum of their parts, and for now, well, there may not be a part in all of basketball they're eager to break up this whole to acquire.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In this article, we will look at 10 of the league's most dangerous 3-point shooters so far this season. Masters of Efficiency Cam Spencer, Grizzlies Spencer has taken a massive leap in his sophomore season, going from 4.2 points in 10.1 minutes per game last season to 12 points on 51.5 percent shooting in 21.7 minutes per game this season. His most impressive work is coming from beyond the arc, where he is knocking down 50.8 percent of his shots, resulting in an average of 2.5 made 3-pointers per game. His long-range shooting percentage stands as the best in the league among players who have played at least 15 games. He is also in the midst of a hot streak, averaging 16.9 points, 2.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, and one steal over the last 10 games.  AJ Green, Bucks Green shot better than 40 percent from deep through his first three seasons and is back at it again. He is currently working on a career-best 48.5 percent mark from deep, which is good for the second-best rate among players who have played at least 15 games. He is averaging 3.3 makes per game, giving his team a great option on the perimeter and forcing defenses to stay honest in their coverage. His impressive track record and strong play to start the year are allowing him to enjoy his first consistent role as a starter, where he is averaging 11.3 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game. Bobby Portis, BucksPortis is not likely a player that most would have expected to find on this list, but he has surely earned it by knocking down a career-best 1.8 3s per game, while shooting a career-best clip of 47.6 percent from deep. His ability to stretch the floor adds to the utility he brings off the bench, primarily characterized by his infectious energy and hustle. Despite his notable contribution, he is seeing slightly fewer minutes per game this season, which is limiting his production in points, rebounds, and assists. However, his standout efficiency from deep is a significant development in his repertoire and should allow him to maintain a significant role in the long run. \nAyo Dosunmu, Bulls Dosunmu is showing an impressive step forward in his 3-point shooting, averaging a career-best 1.9 makes per game on 47.5 percent shooting from deep, which is a major improvement from his previous career high of 40.3 percent. He continues to compete for minutes among a roster that boasts a good amount of depth at the wings and in the backcourt. However, his newfound affinity from deep, in addition to his ability to contribute across the stat sheet, will make a strong case for him to work his way into a more significant role before too long. Vit Krejci, Hawks Krejci shot at least 49 percent from the field in each of the last two seasons and is on pace for a new career high, shooting 50.9 percent from the field this year. In the meantime, he is also averaging a career-best 2.6 made 3-pointers per game, while hitting a blistering 46.5 percent from downtown. His contribution across the board is otherwise relatively limited, making his ability to knock down shots from deep, along with an active defensive presence, essential to the value he brings. Volume Scorers Stephen Curry, Warriors Curry leads the league with an average of 5.2 made 3-pointers per game, while shooting a formidable 41.2 percent from deep. He has averaged more than five 3-pointers per game only three times in his 16 seasons, which makes the current pace even more impressive for the 37-year-old. He has already topped the 40-point mark four times this season, as he continues to lead the way on the offensive end for his squad. On the other hand, his assist numbers are slumping, as he is averaging fewer than five per game for the first time in his career. \nDonovan Mitchell, Cavaliers Mitchell is scoring at the best rate of his career, averaging highs of 30.7 points on 49.4 percent shooting. His efficiency also extends beyond the arc, as he is knocking down a career-high 4.0 3s per game while shooting a career-best 38.1 percent from deep. Despite his dominant play, his squad has been unable to capture the momentum they enjoyed last season, as injuries have been a factor, including Darius Garland playing in only 11 of their 27 games. Nonetheless, Mitchell is showing that he still has room to rise in his ninth season, where he is combining his top-tier skill with veteran savvy.   Tyrese Maxey, 76ers While most of the attention has been focused on his big-name teammates over the last few seasons, Maxey continues to steal the show with superstar-level production. He has improved his scoring average every year in his career, and now, in his sixth season, he is averaging 31.5 points on 46.7 percent shooting, while hitting 3.7 3s per game on 39.1 percent shooting from downtown. He is also averaging a career high in field-goal attempts per game, with more than 20 for a third straight season. His determination to step up and carry the squad has led him to develop into one of the league's most productive and feared guards. Michael Porter Jr., Nets Porter has always been an efficient scorer, shooting better than 48 percent from the field in each of his five healthy seasons. He is currently showing that those numbers were no fluke and not the result of getting open looks from the playmaking and gravity of his former teammates, Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. Instead, Porter is leading the charge for his new squad with a career-high 25.6 points per game on 49.7 percent shooting, including a career-high 3.6 made 3s per game while shooting 39.9 percent from deep. The ability to translate his shot-making and efficiency from a fourth-option role to a first-option role is an extremely impressive development in the 27-year-old's seventh season.\nJames Harden, Clippers The only surprise about Harden being on this list is the fact that he is still among the league's best 3-point scorers in his 17th season in the league. He is averaging 3.6 3-pointers per game, which is his most since 2020-21 and would result in his sixth season averaging at least three per game. He is hitting 37.6 percent from deep, which is very respectable for a player who faces constant defensive attention and continues to deliver strong production across the board. Although his team is struggling this season, Harden is not letting it affect his focus and remains one of the most proficient offensive forces in the game. \n            ",

Then the red-hot Minnesota Wild swung a blockbuster deal for Quinn Hughes, but was that enough to close the gap?If you believe that it takes legitimate superstars to win big in the NHL, and I do, then this trade was a win in Minnesota's quest to take slay dragons in the Western Conference. Yes, the Wild gave up some a very good roster player (Marco Rossi) and key future assets (Zeev Buium and a first-round pick),  but the impact of Hughes outweighs all of that.After all, Hughes is the second-best defenseman in the NHL, and players of his caliber come available about as often as Halley's Comet makes an appearance. The problem for Minnesota is that the best defenseman in the world (Cale Makar) resides in Colorado, and there's a good case to be made that the third best defenseman (Miro Heiskanen) calls Dallas home.That's what the Wild are up against as they continue to roll toward the playoffs. Not only do the Avalanche and Stars have star power, but they're also very deep. With Rossi now out of the equation in Minnesota, the center situation doesn't resemble that of a Stanley Cup contender. That's not ideal, but when Kirill Kaprizov and Matt Boldy are your top wingers, perhaps you can overcome that.The Wild have now won five straight games, and they're within spitting distance of the Stars in second place.

    "body": "\n        Let's leave the official awards to the leagues and their governing bodies, shall we? PGA Tour Player of the Year? That was Scottie Scheffler. Sportsman of the Year? That could be Rory McIlroy. It's almost like the Most Valuable Player versus Offensive Player of the Year discussion in the NFL -- it does not make much sense. Rookie of the Year? Well, that was Aldrich Potgieter.While these awards have their purposes, these fascinating athletes deserve even more unique honors. After all, they're fascinating players playing an intriguing game. These are not your high school superlatives -- best smile, most likely to be the president, most athletic -- but a list of curated achievements from the odd year in golf.Following a 2024 in which Scheffler basically won every notable tournament, this year, the players inside the ropes seemed a little more tense. The PGA Tour tightened its belt with fewer playing opportunities and fewer full-time members, and some started to feel the effects.Letters were penned, meetings were had, cell phones were snatched and a 13 was even penciled onto a scorecard at PGA West. Oh yeah, some players even visited the White House trying to end golf's civil war. (Spoiler alert: It's ongoing.) \nAll of this occurred before the calendar flipped to April. From there, golf mainly occupied center stage thanks to McIlroy's Masters triumph, Scheffler's stunning play at the PGA Championship and The Open, and other feel-good victories belonging to players like Tommy Fleetwood, Justin Rose and J.J. Spaun.But let's not forget about the rules decision late at the U.S. Open or the mud balls and driver testing at the PGA Championship. There was the envelope rule being used at the Ryder Cup, and of course, the karaoke, too. So, as legendary rapper Eminem (and possibly PGA of America President Don Rea) once said, \"You better lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it. You better never let it go. You only get one shot -- do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime.\"\nLet's get into this year's superlatives.Most likely to stop Scottie Scheffler: RavioliThis will be the last nod to the Italian delicacy before the calendar flips to the new year. Preparing a homemade dinner over the holidays before the 2025 season proved to be the only thing that could slow Scheffler down. The world No. 1 was sidelined the first month of the campaign and battled the occasional left miss when he did return to the golf course as he continued to gain more and more strength in a hand injured by glass that shattered while trying to roll out pasta dough.It was a windy road early (for Scheffler's standards), but the end result was a fourth straight PGA Tour Player of the Year campaign that consisted of 20 top 25 finishes, 17 top 10s, six victories and two more major championships in 20 tournaments. Not too shabby for a Schef of his caliber.Most dramatic: Rory McIlroyThis covers both definitions of the word -- \"let me snatch the phone out of your hand while you heckle and record me during the practice round of the Players Championship\" and \"let me take years off everyone's lives while I attempt to complete the career grand slam down the second nine at Augusta National.\"\nNo one was quite as dramatic as McIlroy in 2025.He holed monstrous putts on the 18th green at the Masters and the Irish Open for victories, as well as on the Earth Course in the DP World Tour Championship to force a playoff against Matt Fitzpatrick. He went dark for a month following his win at Augusta National as he was forced to replace his driver at the PGA Championship and got sour at the media before he fended off the U.S. crowd at the Ryder Cup en route to a road triumph for his European team.\nMost likely to hire a new PR team: Wyndham ClarkIt is never good when a player is making more noise outside the ropes than inside the ropes, and unfortunately for the 2023 U.S. Open champion, that was the case this year. The biggest splash Clark conjured came at the PGA Championship, where he whipped his driver back into a T-Mobile-sponsored sign surrounding the tee box on No. 16 at Quail Hollow following a wayward drive.Ironically, the T-Mobile athlete wasn't done. The frustrations boiled over to the U.S. Open, where two years after raising the trophy, Clark raised hell in the Oakmont Country Club locker room. He offered (what some may consider) an apology the following week at the Travelers Championship, but Oakmont did not accept. A letter to its membership was released the following month stating that Clark was banned from the club until he fulfilled certain requirements, such as a charitable donation and counseling.\nMost likely to take matters into his own hands (next time): Keegan BradleyThe United States captain should have played in the Ryder Cup. Yes, it was labeled as one of the most unselfish moves in sports, but sometimes it is OK to be selfish. Bradley started to understand that as the Ryder Cup crept closer.The U.S. captain noted that he was thinking about playing during practice rounds and let his mind drift towards the thought of teaming with Scheffler. His team got behind early and often, some tactical decisions proved unwise, and Bradley once again left a Ryder Cup without a trophy in hand.Now, the question becomes whether he participates in another one, and if so, in what capacity. He could certainly take a vice captain role ... but captain or player? That may be a steeper mountain to scale. Returning as the leader seems far-fetched as of now, but he may have one more run in him as a player, which is why his 2026 season may be among the most intriguing in all of golf.\n\"I really would enjoy playing in one more. I don't know if I'll get the chance,\" Bradley said. \"This effing event has been so brutal to me. I don't know if I want to play. No, I do. It's such a weird thing to love something so much that just doesn't give you anything.\"Most likely to hold a meeting that could have been an email: PGA Tour, LIV Golf\nMost likely to become Father Time: Justin RoseThere's something about a player performing at such a high level on the tail end of his career that is admirable, and no one fit this category more than Rose in 2025. He came agonizingly close to winning the Masters, became the oldest since Phil Mickelson to win on the PGA Tour with his victory at the St. Jude Championship, and once again served as a lynchpin for the European Ryder Cup team at Bethpage Black, where he was putting his ball into what seemed like a swimming pool.The 45-year-old has worked his tail off to maintain his level of play and has even elevated it in recent years. While the consistency is not there, Rose's ceiling performances remain. It is why he still contends in major championships. It's why he does not want to be the Ryder Cup captain in 2027. And it's why, when he talks about the remaining years of his career and what may be possible, you should believe him.\n\"I still feel like there is that golden summer of my career available to me,\" Rose said after winning the St. Jude Championship. \"That's what I've been pushing for. Moments like getting close at [Royal] Troon and then obviously getting close at Augusta [National], they're signals that it's possible. This is another really, really, really important signal that I'm on the right track with my game, and actually maybe even getting a little bit better at the moment.\"Most likely to give it to you straight: Viktor HovlandHe's the best quote in golf because you never know what will come out of his mouth, but you do know Hovland will be honest about any topic tossed his way, whether that is with the state of his game, his swing or what he thinks about extraterrestrial life. Here are some of his greatest hits from 2025:On early-season struggles: \"Right now, it's pretty frustrating. This game of golf, as I said earlier, it's very elusive. It's counterintuitive, and it's very difficult right now. But I know there's a lot of good golf in me that will be there in the future and that I've played in the past. Things will turn around soon. … In my opinion, I suck at it right now, but that's all relative.\" After winning the Valspar Championship: \"I hit a lot of disgusting shots, but they just happened to go where I looked.\"On the long par-3 8th at Oakmont: \"I just think all the best par-3s are under 200 [yards]. … As soon as you start to take head covers off on par 3s, I just think it gets a little silly.\"While in contention at U.S. Open: \"We'd all like to win. There is also a deep passion in me that I want to hit the shots. I want to stand on the tee and hit the shots that I'm envisioning.\"On getting heckled at the Ryder Cup: \"They won't really come close to the thoughts I have in my own head, so I think I'll just laugh it off for the most part.\"\nMost likely to want a do-over: PGA of AmericaPeople make fun of organizations and corporations because it is easy, oftentimes because those organizations and corporations make it so. Enter the PGA of America in 2025.\nIf given a chance to redo the last 12 months, you can bet they would. The decision to make Bradley captain came the year prior, but the effects trickled into 2025, where it became a question at every single tournament stop for the U.S. skipper. In hindsight (and foresight), it was unwise to select a top 15 player in the world to lead a Ryder Cup team without holding a single conversation about the job prior.It did not stop there, though. Players ripped on Quail Hollow leading into the PGA Championship, stating it was nearly identical to what they typically see at the annual PGA Tour stop. To the organization's credit, it decided to play the ball down amid wet conditions and players' displeasure; unfortunately, the lack of communication regarding driver testing brought a different cloud over the championship.Now, back to the Ryder Cup: The Master of Ceremonies who relinquished her microphone and the PGA of America president who would not relinquish his. LinkedIn posts, non-apologetic apologies and damage control all ensued, and it all could have been avoided if the event had been better run.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        U.S. women's national team and Portland Thorns forward Sophia Wilson is set to return to the Pacific Northwest for the 2026 NWSL season with a record-setting option, reportedly worth $1 million. Wilson previously signed a two-year deal in 2024 with a player option. The initial contract was the first ever announced with such a lever, instead of the typical club or mutual option, and negotiated ahead of recent league proposals to create new salary cap mechanisms.\"Coming back to Portland is so special to me because Portland is where I started my professional career and where I've grown up in a lot of ways. I'm excited for the city. I love living here. I love the people here. I'm excited to get back with everyone and play in Providence Park and to play in front of the Riveters. There's no place like it. That is the place to play and I'm excited to be back in it,\" Wilson said in a club statement.She spent the 2025 season away from the pitch on maternity leave. She and her husband, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson, welcomed their daughter, Gianna, in September. \n\nWilson's scoring pedigreeWilson's profile has skyrocketed since being drafted by the club in 2019. She's been the leading goal scorer for the team since 2021 and the cornerstone of the Thorns' attack for consecutive years. She's also become a recognizable star on the USWNT, alongside the attacking trio \"Triple Espresso\" with Trinity Rodman and Mallory Swanson. The winning front three were responsible for 10 out of 12 goals scored during the Summer Games, and won the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nFor the Thorns, Wilson's return is more than just a homecoming; it's a major roster upgrade, and it's a reminder of the former team identity. A necessity after the club recently parted ways with former head coach Rob Gale. The familiar surroundings will likely be helpful to the 25-year-old as she now focuses on returning from maternity leave. \"We are thrilled to have a world-class player like Sophia continue to call Portland her home,\" said President and General Manager of Soccer Operations Jeff Agoos. \"Sophia is an exceptional global star that can change the game in an instant. She will strengthen our roster's attack, and her return makes our front line one the most formidable in the NWSL.\"She was the youngest player in league history to win the NWSL MVP in 2022 and was the Golden Boot winner in 2023. Her return to the club and the league amidst ongoing attention on USWNT player departures overseas can be viewed as a massive win for the American league. \nImpact on state of the leagueHer new one year option sends a significant financial message across the league. The record single season salary puts her at the forefront of the league's player compensation discussion. Her choice to exercise the option stands in direct contrast to the ongoing contract saga surrounding USWNT teammate Trinity Rodman. Rodman's free agency has triggered intense conversations about \"getting creative\" in efforts to retain the NWSL's biggest stars. Wilson's deal, as previously structured and agreed upon before recent debates, now serves as a temporary benchmark for what a \"High Impact Player\" contract could look like in the modern NWSL. What's nextWilson's last game in the league was during the 2024 NWSL playoffs, a quarterfinal loss to Gotham FC. The league will kick off official competition with the 2026 NWSL Challenge Cup on Feb. 20, and the 2026 NWSL regular season is set to return on March 13.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 MLB offseason is six weeks old and so far 22 of our top 50 free agents have signed and our No. 1 trade candidate has been dealt.  Spring training is two months away and there is still a lot of player  movement to come between now and then. Here now are Wednesday's hot stove  happenings.  Bichette willing to move to second\nFree agent Bo Bichette has started telling teams he's willing to move to second base, reports MLB.com. Bichette played second in the World Series and it was his first time playing the position in MLB. He handled about as well as could be expected considering he was coming off a knee injury and still hobbled. We ranked Bichette as the third-best free agent available this offseason.Still only 27, Bichette's shortstop defense has graded out poorly the last few years, and second base does seem like his ultimate long-term home. If nothing else, the World Series showing is proof of concept that yeah, he can do it. Whichever team signs Bichette will do so for his bat, not his glove, though a willingness to move to second base figures to open up his market a bit.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mets, Phillies add relieversTwo NL East rivals added to their bullpens Wednesday. The Mets have agreed to a deal with right-hander Luke Weaver and the Phillies have done the same with fellow righty Brad Keller, per the New York Post. Both pitchers received a two-year contract worth $22 million. We ranked Weaver as the 20th-best free agent available this offseason and Keller the 35th-best.\nWeaver enjoyed a strong two-year stint across town the Yankees from 2024-25, though he did fade badly down the stretch this past season. The Mets surely believe that was a blip, not a sign of decline. \nKeller had an excellent 2025 with the Cubs and, not coincidentally, it was his first season as a full-time reliever and his first healthy season in several years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tMariners still after Donovan, Marte  After losing Jorge Polanco to free agency, the Mariners are looking for second base help, and they're pursuing Diamondbacks star Ketel Marte and Cardinals do-it-all guy Brendan Donovan, reports The Athletic. Both Marte and Donovan were All-Stars in 2025. Donovan has recent outfield experience, which could be appealing because Seattle has several highly regarded infield prospects coming, namely Colt Emerson.  \nThe Mariners went to Game 7 of the ALCS this past season and have one of the game's best rotations, not to mention Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodríguez in their primes. The team's World Series window is wide open. For that reason, pursuing Marte makes the most sense because he is the best player available on the trade market. He's an impact player who would meaningfully improve the team's World Series odds.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tRangers seeking rotation help  The Rangers are looking to add to their rotation, reports DLLS Sports. Texas has a strong 1-2 punch in Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi, and things really clicked for Jack Leiter in the second half this past season. Kumar Rocker and Jacob Latz are next on the rotation depth chart behind them, hence the club's interest in adding another starter.  It has been a fairly busy offseason for the Rangers, who swapped Marcus Semien for Brandon Nimmo, re-signed late-inning reliever Chris Martin, and added depth players Tyler Alexander, Alexis Díaz, and Danny Jansen. There is a glaring need in the back of the rotation though. Even if Rocker has what feels like a long-awaited breakout, there's room for improvement in the starting staff.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n      \tAngels sign Pomeranz, Romano  Late Tuesday night the Angels reinforced their bullpen with lefty Drew Pomeranz and righty Jordan Romano. Pomeranz gets one year and $4 million. Romaro received one year and $2 million. They'll join righty Robert Stephenson in new manager Kurt Suzuki's late-inning mix. Neither Pomeranz nor Romano ranked among our top 50 free agents.  The Angels ranked 28th in bullpen ERA and 27th in bullpen WAR in 2025, and that was with Kenley Jansen have a strong season in the closer's role. Pomeranz had a resurgent 2025 for the Cubs while Romano fits the Halos' offseason M.O. as a recognizable name looking to bounce back next season. Previous additions Vaughn Grissom, Alek Manoah, and Grayson Rodriguez all fit the bill as well.   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Dolphins signed quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension in July 2024 a couple of days after training camp opened. Nothing has gone smoothly for Tagovailoa since signing the extension, topped off by his benching on Wednesday. Tagovailoa suffered his third diagnosed NFL concussion during a Week 2 game versus the Buffalo Bills last season. Because of the increasing severity of the concussions, there were calls for Tagovailoa to retire. Tagovailoa returned to action after missing four games while on injured reserve because of the head trauma.Performance has been the primary issue with Tagovailoa this season. Tagovailoa had two straight three-interception games in Weeks 6 and 7, which dropped Miami's record to 1-6. He was benched for 2025 seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers during the fourth quarter of the Browns game and Ewers will take over in Week 16 after Tua's poor performance against the Steelers on Monday night.Tagovailoa's 15 interceptions are the highest in the NFL this season. Throwing teammates under the bus publicly for being late to or missing players only team meetings following Week 6's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers didn't help Tagovailoa's cause.\nTagovailoa's decline is raising questions about how much longer he will be in Miami. A trade won't be a realistic possibility given Tagovailoa's poor play and the durability concerns because of his multiple concussions.\n        \n            \n                Who is Quinn Ewers? Draft scouting report for new Dolphins starting QB after Tua Tagovailoa benching\n                \n                    R.J. White                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTagovailoa's contract holds the answers. There aren't any good solutions for the Dolphins because of the way the deal was structured.Tagovailoa's contract detailsTagovailoa's $53.1 million-per-year extension runs though the 2028 season. His contract has $167.171 million in guarantees where $93.171 million was fully guaranteed at signing. The $93.171 million included a $42 million signing bonus, which is prorated on the salary cap at $8.4 million annually from 2024 through 2028.\nTagovailoa's deal contains two option bonuses. The double-option bonus is one of the more complicated structures with NFL contracts.Tagovailoa's fully guaranteed $50.046 million 2025 base salary reduced to $25.046 million when an option for a dummy or fake 2029 contract year voiding five days after the 2028 league year's Super Bowl in February 2029 was exercised this past March during the first couple of days of the current league year. There was a corresponding $25 million payment (i.e.; option bonus) in order to get this dummy contract year. Option bonuses are prorated over the life of a contract (up to a maximum of five years), including the option years, beginning in the league year when the option is exercised. This means the $25 million option bonus is prorated on the salary cap at $5 million annually from 2025 through 2029.\nThe second option must be picked up between the first day (March 11) and 10th day (March 20) of the 2026 league year. Paying the required $15 million for Tagovailoa's dummy 2030 contract year, which also voids five days after the 2028 league year's Super Bowl, will drop his fully guaranteed $54 million 2026 base salary to a fully guaranteed $39 million. This $54 million was guaranteed for injury at signing and became completely secure in March on the third day of the 2025 league year.From a salary cap standpoint, the presumption is option years will be picked up. Because of this, the $15 million is being prorated on the salary cap at $3 million annually from 2026 through 2030.Tagovailoa's 2026 cap number is listed as $56.4 million. The components are $8.4 million of signing bonus proration, $5 million of option bonus proration (the first option), $3 million of option bonus proration (the second option), Tagovailoa's reduced $39 million base salary, a $250,000 workout bonus and $750,000 in per-game roster bonuses ($44,117.65 for each game active). \nThere's another relevant part of Tagovailoa's contract. It's his 2027 base salary. Out of this $31 million, $20 million was guaranteed for injury at signing. Next March 13 on the third day of the 2026 league year, $3 million of the $20 million is fully guaranteed. Another $17 million becomes fully guaranteed on the third day of the 2027 league year.Here are scenarios in which the Dolphins could part ways with Tagovailoa and the financial impacts each would present:\n        \n            \n                Bill Cowher skewers 'disinterested' Dolphins after 1-6 start: 'We see the product that's on the field'\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nScenario 12026 release: No post-June 1 designation/no option exercise $42.8 million 2026 salary cap increase/$99.2 million 2026 dead moneyCutting Tagovailoa conventionally in 2026 is virtually impossible. The Dolphins would have $99.2 million in dead money, a cap charge for a player no longer on the roster, by releasing Tagovailoa before exercising the option for his voiding 2030 contract year and $3 million of the $20 million guaranteed for injury in 2027 becomes fully guaranteed next March 13. \nThe record for dead money related to an individual player in one league year is quarterback Russell Wilson's $53 million because of the Denver Broncos releasing him in March 2024. The $99.2 million for the 2026 league year would be close to twice as much as Wilson's record-setting amount.Without exercising the option, Tagovailoa's fully guaranteed $54 million 2026 base salary would count entirely on Miami's books. There also wouldn't be any of the proration for the $15 million option bonus that wouldn't be paid.The dead money would consist of Tagovailoa's fully guaranteed $54 million 2026 base salary, $25.2 million of signing bonus proration relating to his 2026 through 2028 contract years and the $20 million of option bonus proration from these three contract years as well as the dummy 2029 contract year.\nScenario 22026 release: Post-June 1 designation/no option exercise $11 million 2026 salary cap increase/$67.4 million 2026 dead money/$31.8 million 2027 dead moneyReleasing Tagovailoa with a post-June 1 designation isn't as cap prohibitive as cutting him conventionally. Nonetheless, the 2026 dead money is $11 million more than Tagovailoa's listed 2026 cap figure. The same timing as without using a post-June 1 designation would apply.A team can release two players each league year before June 2 using a post-June 1 designation that will be treated under the cap as if released after June 1. With a post-June 1 designation, a team is required to carry the player's full cap number until June 2 even though he is no longer part of the roster. The player's salary comes off the books at that time unless it is guaranteed. Tagovailoa's 2026 base salary wouldn't reduce from $54 million to $39 million because the option isn't being exercised under this scenario. Since this $54 million base salary is already fully guaranteed, it would remain a Miami cap charge. \nOnly the current year's bonus proration counts toward the cap with players released using a post-June 1 designation. The acceleration of the bonus proration in future contract years is delayed until the following league year (2027 in this case), which typically begins in early to mid-March.The total dead money or residual cap charges is still $99.2 million. It's taken over two years with $67.4 million in 2026 and $31.8 million in 2027 instead of all during the 2026 league year. The $67.4 million consists of the $54 million 2026 base salary, $8.4 million in 2026 signing bonus proration and $5 million in 2026 option bonus proration. The $31.8 million for 2027 would be composed of $16.8 million in signing bonus proration from Tagovailoa's 2027 and 2028 contract years and the $15 million in option bonus proration relating to the final three years of the deal, which includes the voiding 2029 contract year. Tagovailoa would be off Miami's books beginning in 2028 with use of a post-June 1 designation.\nScenario 3 2026 release: Post-June 1 designation/option exercised $1 million 2026 salary cap savings/$55.4 million 2026 dead money/$43.8 million 2027 dead moneyThe only viable option for getting rid of Tagovailoa in 2026 is releasing him with a post-June 1 designation after exercising the second option. The timing would be the same as with the other two scenarios.The Dolphins will have $1 million in 2026 cap savings by releasing Tagovailoa in this manner. The difference from Tagovailoa's listed $56.4 million cap number would be the removal of his $250,000 workout bonus and $750,000 of per-game roster bonuses from Miami's salary cap on June 2.The $16.8 million of signing bonus prorated in the 2027 and 2028 contract years, the $15 million in first option bonus prorated from those two contract years in addition to the voiding 2029 contract years and the $12 million in option bonus proration from the 2027 and 2028 contract years as well as the voiding 2029 and 2030 contract years would be 2027 cap charges. This $43.8 million in 2027 dead money would represent a $9.6 million cap savings for the Dolphins from Tagovailoa's $53.4 million cap number. Miami wouldn't have any more cap charges for Tagovailoa after 2027.\nTagovailoa's guarantees have offsets so Miami would get some nominal 2026 cap relief from the contract he signed with another team. Presumably, Tagovailoa would sign for league-minimum salary in 2026, just like Wilson did in 2024, because of his massive base-salary guarantee.The $99.2 million of residual cap charges taken over two years, 2026 and 2027, would also be a record for most the dead money relating to a single player contract. That's currently the combined $85 million for Wilson from 2024 and 2025 because he was released with a post-June 1 designation. The offset isn't being factored into these calculations.Scenario 4 2027 release: No post-June 1 designation$6.6 million 2027 salary cap savings/$46.8 million 2027 dead moneyThe Dolphins will need to release Tagovailoa before the third day of the 2027 league year to avoid being on the hook for an additional $17 million in 2027 salary. The 2027 dead money is $46.8 million rather than the $43.8 million by releasing Tagovailoa in 2026 with a post-June 1 designation as in Scenario 3 because of the $3 million of his 2027 salary being fully guaranteed in March 2026.The components are the same as with a post-June 1 designation release in Scenario 3, plus the $3 million 2027 salary guarantee. The cap savings would increase to $9.6 million because of the offset with the salary guarantee provided Tagovailoa could sign a contract elsewhere in 2027 for $3 million or more. Regardless, Tagovailoa would be off Miami's books starting in 2028.Scenario 5 2027 release: Post-June 1 designation $34 million 2027 salary cap savings/$19.4 million 2027 dead money/$27.4 million 2028 dead moneyThe timing of releasing Tagovailoa will be the same whether or not a post-June 1 designation is used. By using a post-June 1 designation, the Dolphins would have $19.4 million in 2027 dead money composed of the $8.4 million in 2027 signing bonus proration, $5 million in 2027 first option bonus proration, $3 million in 2027 second option bonus proration and the $3 million 2027 base salary guarantee. The $27.4 million of dead money in 2028 would consist of $8.4 million in 2028 signing bonus proration, $10 million in first option bonus proration from the 2028 contract year and 2029 voiding contract year and $9 million in second option bonus proration from the 2028 contract year, as well as the 2029 and 2030 contract years. Tagovailoa would be off Miami's books beginning in 2029.Final thoughtsConventional wisdom has suggested Tagovailoa will be with the Dolphins in 2026. Miami's 2026 salary cap situation is less than ideal for letting Tagovailoa go next year. The Dolphins have the NFL's fourth-most 2026 cap commitments at $320.051 million with 36 players under contract, according to NFLPA data. The top 51 salaries (i.e.; salary cap numbers) matter under offseason accounting rules. There's just under $715,000 of existing cap space that can be carried over to 2026. Assuming the 2026 salary cap is set in the $300 million to $305 million range, getting $1 million in cap relief by releasing Tagovailoa with a post-June 1 designation next March will only marginally affect the overage.This thinking was before Tagovailoa's subpar play. Unless Tagovailoa can start regaining his previous form where Miami starts winning games, there will likely be changes in 2026 with McDaniel being fired at a minimum. It would be interesting to see whether a new regime would even want Tagovailoa to be a bridge quarterback next season with the plan being to find his successor early in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With only a few games remaining in the regular season, most of the focus in and around the NFL is on the playoff race. And that's not surprising, because that's what really matters at the end of the day. But there are also other things at stake, especially when it comes to the future of the league. Not everybody who is in their current job, will have that job next year, for one reason or another. There are always players changing teams and moving into or out of the league, and there will always be coaching changes that occur. We're here to talk about the latter of those things, and specifically about coordinators. There are coordinators in the league who have a lot to prove over the final few weeks of the season and potentially into the playoffs, and we want to highlight some of them here. We're going to separate this (not necessarily exhaustive) list of coordinators into three buckets: coordinators trying to hang onto their jobs, coordinators trying to prove their mettle as head coach candidates and coordinators who are probably already in the mix for head coach positions this offseason.\nTrying to keep their jobOC Kevin Patullo, EaglesDC Matt Eberflus, CowboysOC Zac Robinson, FalconsDC Al Golden, BengalsPatullo has been under fire basically all year, and mostly with good reason. Sure, the Eagles went off against the Raiders last weekend, but that's the Raiders. The offense has been listless for most of the season, and Patullo has seemed like he doesn't have the answers. We know that the Eagles aren't afraid to change coordinators after a season when they struggle -- even when the guy they promoted to the job came from in house. Jerry Jones all but confirmed earlier this week that Eberflus is coaching for his job over the final few weeks of the season. Again, it makes sense that would be the case. His unit has struggled badly for almost the entire year, and he seems to be trying to fit square pegs in round holes by not adapting his system to the talent on hand. He's asking man-to-man corners to play a ton of zone, for example, and it's led to anyone and everyone being able to throw the ball against Dallas. Running it is somewhat difficult because the Cowboys made that priority No. 1, but everything else has fallen apart. Robinson's fate might be tied to that of head coach Raheem Morris, but it's still been disappointing to watch Atlanta's offense this year. Despite employing Bijan Robinson, the Falcons are only around a league-average rushing team, and their passing offense was wildly inconsistent throughout the year. Robinson has not been able to get the best out of Kirk Cousins (last year) or Michael Penix Jr. (this year), and if it comes down to a choice between losing a coordinator or losing a job, you have to think that Morris might decide to move on and try something new next year.\nGolden was hired to fix Lou Anarumo's unit (more on Anarumo in a minute) and has not come close to doing so. Firing a coordinator after one year when he doesn't have the requisite talent on hand might be an overreaction, but we also know that the Bengals probably aren't going to pay multiple head coaches at once and so Zac Taylor likely isn't going anywhere, which means that shuffling the deck chairs on the defense again is more likely to be the significant change they make this offseason.Potential head coach candidatesOC Joe Brady, BillsOC Todd Monken, RavensDC Lou Anarumo, ColtsOC Kliff Kingsbury, CommandersDC Anthony Campanile, JaguarsDC Kelvin Sheppard, LionsDC Matt Burke, TexansThere have been different points this season where Brady might have been in one of the other two sections on this list. Buffalo's offense has at times looked unstoppable and at others looked like it's lost. He's overall done a very good job of piloting the ship for Josh Allen, and leaning into running the ball more often and then utilizing heavy formations and throwing out of those has been a good formula for the Bills. There might just be some teams that want to see more here. If this were last year, Monken might be on the next list. He'd be coming off two consecutive seasons of coordinator one of the best offenses in the NFL, fresh off having found a similar level of success at Georgia. But the Ravens have taken a significant step backward this year. A lot of that has to do with Lamar Jackson's injury, obviously, but teams are probably going to be reluctant to hire a 59-year-old first-time head coach if his unit isn't coming off an elite season. \nAnarumo is reportedly going to be in the mix for some jobs this offseason. He's probably been vindicated in the Bengals' defensive disaster given how bad the team still was under Golden (see above), and the improvement he got out of the Colts this year has been impressive. Given him real, veteran players and he can build a competent or better defense. He's also shown at times that he can generate answers against the league's best quarterbacks, when he does have the players. The only things holding him back here are the end of the Bengals tenure, as well as the fact that teams might find some of the younger defensive minds (see below) more intriguing.Kingsbury is another offensive guy who might have been a hotter name last year, coming off of helping Jayden Daniels turn the Commanders around in one season. He also might be a good who is actually in the role he's best suited for at this point. Coordinating an offense and not having to worry about the other stuff might just be what he's best at. He is intriguing enough as an offensive designer to get looks, though, and he's still young enough that he'll have plenty of chances if he wants to make the jump again.Then we get into the young defensive coordinators who might be a year or so away from being top candidates, but who could potentially garner some looks this year if there are enough openings and teams decide that the \"how do we stop the top offenses in the league\" archetype is the one they want to go after. Campanile is 43 years old, Sheppard is 37 and Burke (who calls the defensive plays for Houston despite DeMeco Ryans being the head coach) is 49. They could all fit the mold of a Mike Macdonald type, and given the success he's had in Seattle and the relative lack of obvious offensive-minded candidates, they could thrust themselves into the mix as well.\nAlready in the mixThere's also a list of coordinators who are likely to be at or near the top of a lot of interview lists this offseason because they have already proven their mettle to one degree or another given the success of their respective units and their connections to specific coaching archetypes or coaching trees. That list includes but is not limited to Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores (there are, admittedly, complicating factors here given Flores' lawsuit against the league), Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's a two-horse race at quarterback for the number one overall pick on the eve of the college football playoff. Could this be the first time since 2017, though, that a quarterback goes top-10, but not No. 1 overall? There are some highly touted pass-rushers and receivers nipping on the quarterbacks heels as the highly-paid positions dominate the early part of this list.The other thing dominating the early part of this list is Buckeyes. Ohio State has five of the top-16 prospects on this list and four more in the top-100. The crazy thing is, the one that will be drafted the highest for them isn't even draft eligible. They truly are one of the most talented college football teams of all time and should be within striking distance of the most first-rounders in a single draft (6: 2021 Alabama & 2004 Miami) and the most draft picks in a single draft (15: 2022 Georgia).1. Fernando Mendoza, QB, IndianaIt's been a storybook season for the Heisman trophy winner and could very easily end with a National Championship and No. 1 overall draft selection. Mendoza is a quick decision maker who understands the game at a high-level. His ability to attack tight windows and operate from tight pockets makes you feel good about his floor in the NFL.2. Dante Moore, QB, OregonMoore is a little more of a wild card than Mendoza at this point with far less experience. And what experience Moore does have has come from the cushiest pockets in all of college football behind a star-studded Oregon offensive line that features four players on this list.\n3. Rueben Bain Jr., DE, Miami (FL)Bain may not have the ideal edge body, but he has a trump card: power. He's the most powerful defensive end prospect that I've scouted in my 12 years of doing this. No college tackle could go punch for punch with him.4. Jordyn Tyson, WR, Arizona StateTyson just gets open. He can run any route at any level and he'll be a handful for the corner guarding him. His release package already looks like an NFL veteran. The only thing holding him back is his injury history after missing time in each of the past three seasons.5. Carnell Tate, WR, Ohio StateTate has blossomed into a well-rounded No. 1 type of wide receiver. He just happens to be playing next to one of the greatest wide receiver prospects of all-time. His ability to track and pluck the football out of the air is nothing short of elite.\n6. Arvell Reese, DE, Ohio StateReese is the modern hybrid linebacker that's en vogue throughout the NFL. He can wear almost any hat in the front-seven and play it at a high-level. I just wish we got to see him really pin his ears back and attack opposing quarterbacks more.7. Trevor Goosby, OT, TexasGoosby was up and down in his first season as a full-time starter, but by season's end he was the clear cut OT1 on tape for me. His ability to generate movement in the run game is outstanding. It's all there for him to be a pro-bowl caliber player in the NFL.8. Spencer Fano, OG, UtahFano projects as an elite zone-scheme guard in the NFL despite playing right tackle for Utah. He is the best lineman in the draft class on the move where he is so dang good at locating and engaging defenders.\n9. Caleb Downs, S, Ohio StateDowns is the brother of Colts wide receiver Josh Downs. If you've ever seen Josh run routes, picture those elite quicks with a couple more inches and about 30 more pounds. That's Caleb. He's an instinctive and fearless player on the back end that has so few holes to his game.10. Peter Woods, DT, ClemsonWhen you put on tape what Woods did as a freshman and sophomore, it's hard to drop him too far after a lackluster junior season. If we are just basing Woods's projection off of what he put on tape this past fall, though, he's 20 spots lower than this. The flashes of power and explosiveness were still there, but the consistency was not.11. Jermod McCoy, CB, TennesseeMcCoy has already declared for the NFL draft despite the fact that the last time we saw him play football was against Ohio State in last year's playoff. Similar to Woods, McCoy's sophomore tape was so good that it's hard to ding him too much. After tearing his ACL in January, McCoy will have to prove he's still the guy he was before with on-field workouts and testing to maintainhis draft stock.\n\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            12. Jeremiyah Love, RB, Notre DameLove is easily the most dynamic runner in the draft class with the kind of skillset that everyone is looking for nowadays in the NFL. He has the ability to turn 5-yard gains into 50-yard gains and did so often for the Irish.13. Sonny Styles, LB, Ohio StateI don't often advocate for drafting true off-ball linebackers highly, but Styles is changing that. He truly has everything you could want physically for the position with a massive wingspan and elite range. Oh, and he doesn't miss tackles. Literally. PFF has charted him with zero missed tackles on 86 attempts this season. That's a good combination.14. Keldric Faulk, DL, AuburnFaulk is your \"upside\" play along the defensive line this year. His tape as a pass-rusher was nothing special this season with only 31 pressures all year, but he possesses high-end developmental traits in that regard. At 6-foot-6, 285 pounds he's got great length, bend, and power to win in the NFL.\n15. Francis Mauigoa, OT, Miami (FL)Mauigoa may not be the fleet footed tackle we usually think of going highly in the draft, but he makes up for it by being a brick wall. You aren't going to bull-rush him and you aren't going to send him backwards in the run game. His consistency is much improved this year in his third season as a starter.16. Kayden McDonald, DT, Ohio StateMcDonald is the single most dominant run defender in the draft class. He not only holds the point against doubles, but he can also range to make plays. You just have to live with the fact that he'll never be a high-impact pass-rusher.17. Olaivavega Ioane, IOL, Penn StateIoane is a steady and experienced guard. He's taken his game to another level this season with so few ugly reps to speak of on tape. He should be a day one starter in the NFL.\n18. Avieon Terrell, CB, ClemsonTerrell is the younger brother of Falcons cornerback A.J. and plays like he has a chip on his shoulder. He's a shorter, feistier corner who could very easily slide into the slot in the NFL as well.19. T.J. Parker, DE, ClemsonParker had a disappointing junior campaign - like many on Clemson - but he's been consistently productive enough in the past to still feel good about his NFL prospects. He's a three-down 4-3 defensive end that wins with power.20. David Bailey, DE, Texas TechBailey has the best first step in the draft class that he consistently uses to his advantage. It's why he led college football in pressure this season. He may be more of a pass-rusher only at the NFL level, but that not nearly the pejorative that it used to be.\n21. Kadyn Proctor, OL, AlabamaProctor may not be quick enough to play tackle in dropback heavy schemes, but if you want to run the ball more effectively he's your man. Proctor is absurdly powerful and can really crush a double.22. Makai Lemon, WR, USCLemon may not be that big, nor that fast, but he's just good at football. He knows how to run routes, find space in zones, and is tough as nails at the catch point. It's why he won the Biletnikoff Award this year.23. Kenyon Sadiq, TE, OregonSadiq is one impressive specimen at tight end. He's about as filled out a tight end as you'll ever see for someone who's still only 20-years old. It shows with his ability to break tackles and block in space.\n24. Max Iheanachor, OT, Arizona StateIheanachor's tape may not be as clean as other offensive tackles behind him on this list, but when watching him you have to take into consideration that he only started playing football in 2021. Through that lens his ability to shut down speed rushers this past season is eye-popping. His quick feet and easy mirroring ability is what the high-end starters at the next level look like.25. Mansoor Delane, CB, LSUDelane was the stingiest corner in all of college football this past fall. No one was better in pure man coverage. While he's not going to light up the Combine or his Pro Day, Delane is just a ball player.26. Jake Golday, LB, CincinnatiGolday is a former edge-rusher who switched to off-ball linebacker and now moves like a safety. That's the kind of combination you want in a first-round linebacker. His ability to do a little bit of everything for a defense at edge-defender size will be coveted highly.\n27. Caleb Lomu, OT, UtahLomu still needs to get stronger, but you can't teach his hands in pass protection. They are quick and efficient. If the physical aspect of his game improves, you'll have a quality pass protector in the league.28. Emmanuel Pregnon, OG, OregonPregnon is a four year starter finally lived up to his immense physical tools this fall. He's about as well put together a guard prospect  you'll see and he moves so easily on the field because of it. Pregnon was easily the best Ducks lineman this year on a loaded unit.29. Emmanuel McNeil-Warren, S, ToledoMcNeil-Warren is everything you could want in a box safety. He's big, he's a hitter, he's fluid, and he has a knack for the football. McNeil-Warren forced 11 fumbles and picked off five passes in his career.\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            30. Ty Simpson, QB, AlabamaSimpson hasn't looked like a first-year starter for the Tide this year. He just gets himself in trouble trying to do too much at times. Being only a first-year starter, he has a lot of his draft stock riding on how he performs in the playoff.31. KC Concepcion, WR, Texas A&MConcepcion is one of the easiest separators in the draft class. He's got that unique ability to bounce in and out of cuts without losing speed. The only thing missing is consistent hands, but they've been better this year.32. Caleb Banks, DT, FloridaBanks returned from an early season foot injury to show that he is the most imposing defensive tackle prospect in the draft class. He only played 96 snaps this season, but on them you saw offensive linemen consistently melt when trying to block him. While he didn't get to alleviate the  consistency concerns we had after last season, the high-end reps are hard to ignore.33. Chris Brazzell, WR, TennesseeBrazzell is a throw-back deep threat with a long frame and long speed. He can go up over the top of corners on go-balls to haul them in or run away from them entirely.34. Matayo Uiagalelei, DE, OregonOne of the youngest players on this list, Uiagalelei is no sure thing to declare. The former five-star has started to put it all together, but you can tell he has the potential to push his stock even higher than this in the future.35. Cashius Howell, DE, Texas A&MHowell is an undersized speed-rusher who knows how to attack opposing quarterbacks. He may be a designated pass-rusher in the NFL with his lack of length, but he's proven he can give good offensive tackles fits.36. Omar Cooper Jr., WR, IndianaCooper is best known for his toe-tap touchdown to stave off an upset against Penn State. He often does his best work after the catch, though. He's one of the hardest receivers to bring down in all of college football.37. CJ Allen, LB, GeorgiaAllen is a throwback linebacker who wants to square up everything he sees in front of him. He'll be a perfect fit for blitz heavy schemes because of that.38. Trevor Lauck, OT, IowaLauck is unlikely to declare after only one season as a starter even though his tape was extremely clean. He allowed only five pressures all season and showed great body control in doing so.39. Lee Hunter, DT, Texas TechHunter is the perfect one-gap nose tackle at the next level. No defensive tackle in this class has shown a more consistent ability to shed blocks than Hunter. While he gets himself in trouble getting playmaker happy at times, Hunter's disruption is worth it.\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            40. Denzel Boston, WR, WashingtonBoston is a big-bodies outside receiver who has elite ball skills. Whether it's at the catch point or having to go outside his frame, chances are Boston is still coming down with it. He may not be a natural separator, but he knows how to win with his size.41. Ahmad Moten, DT, Miami (FL)In a class full of run-first defensive tackles, Moten has consistently flashed pass-rushing juice. It shows up week in and week out. It's why he's had multiple pressures in each of his last eight games this season.42. A'Mauri Washington, DT, OregonWashington may not be a finished product, but you don't need too many moves to make an impact when you have the first step Washington possesses at 330 pounds. He can really get off the ball and into the backfield.43. Keionte Scott, S, Miami (FL)Scott is the top slot corner on my board. His ability to dart around blocks to ball carriers in the box is top notch. While no one is mistaking him for a cornerback in coverage, Scott is instinctive and quick enough in zone to make plays on footballs.44. Monroe Freeling, OT, GeorgiaFreeling got steadily better as the season wore on. That was really apparent in the run game where he was displacing defenders with ease by the end of the season. In a weak tackle class, Freeling could end up going higher than this because of the upward trajectory of his play.45. Jamari Johnson, TE, OregonI have a bit of a hunch that the tight end who's not even a starter for the Ducks won't declare early, but that doesn't mean we can't recognize his talent. The 6-foot-5 tight end has a massive frame and catch radius. It's why he hauled in 23 of his 26 targets this season for 320 yards.46. Malachi Lawrence, DE, UCFLawrence has broad shoulders, long arms, and plays with an uncoachable violence. He got better every single year at UCF and down the stretch this season was unblockable.47. Anthony Hill Jr., LB, TexasDon't let Hill's name might get lost in a loaded linebacker class. He's such a fluid linebacker that has all the tools to develop into a playmaker in coverage. He's been starting since his freshman year for the Longhorns and his season he improved greatly as a tackler.48. Christen Miller, DT, GeorgiaMiller is a tremendous run defender who has a 3-4 defensive end body type. He has long arms that he uses well to keep opposing offensive linemen at bay. Like most Georgia linemen, he isn't a developed pass-rusher, but he's a good enough athlete to develop in that regard.49. Akheem Mesidor, DE, Miam (FL)Mesidor's story to getting to this spot is a wild one. Growing up in Canada, Mesidor didn't play football until high school and then transferred to a school in Florida when it looked like he could have a future there. He went to West Virginia where he started his career as a nose tackle before transferring and trimming down to play off the edge for the Hurricanes. After a foot injury hampered him in 2023 and 2024, Mesidor has blossomed into one of the best all-around defensive linemen in college football at 24-years old this fall.50. Carter Smith, OT, IndianaWhat Smith lacks in technique he makes up for in grit. He fueled the Hoosiers underrated rushing attack this season. He may be better off at guard in the NFL, but is worth a shot at tackle to start.51-10051. Kade Pieper, IOL, Iowa52. Brandon Cisse, CB, South Carolina53. Austin Barber, OT, Florida54.

    "body": "\n        The sixth edition of the World Baseball Classic will be played in March 2026, three years after a thrilling 2023 finale between USA and Japan. That, of course, ended when Shohei Ohtani struck out then-Angels teammate Mike Trout. It was the most captivating moment of the baseball season, MLB postseason included. Hopefully we're in for more of the same next spring. The WBC expanded to 20 teams last time and the top four finishers in the four 2023 pools received an automatic berth into the 2026 WBC. Those 16 teams are Australia, Canada, Cuba, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Korea, United States, and Venezuela. Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, and Nicaragua earned the final four berths in qualifying tournaments during spring training 2025. The pools for the 2026 WBC were finalized in April, with the U.S. in the same bracket as Mexico, Italy, Great Britain, and Brazil. The tournament opens with Pool C (Tokyo) on March 5. Pool A (Puerto Rico), Pool B (Houston), and Pool D (Miami) begin play the next day. The Championship Game is scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, at loanDepot Park in Miami, the same venue that hosted the 2023 WBC Championship Game. Long-time big leaguer and current MLB Network analyst Mark DeRosa will return as Team USA's manager.\"Getting the chance to share the clubhouse and dugout with USA's  greatest staff and players was one of the highlights of my life,\" DeRosa said in April. \"I'm extremely grateful and fired up to get another opportunity  to put USA across my chest come March.\" \nJapan went 7-0 and outscored their opponents 56-18 in their seven games en route to their third WBC title in 2023 (they also won in 2006 and 2009). The Dominican Republic won the 2013 WBC and USA won the 2017 tournament. Here now are the players who have already committed to suiting up for USA  in the 2026 WBC. The roster is subject to change right up until it is  announced officially.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Aaron Judge, Yankees Judge, the reigning two-time American League MVP, was announced as USA's captain and the first player to commit to the club back in April. It will be his first time playing in the WBC. \"I wanted to be there (in 2023). I was looking forward to this opportunity  again,\" the Yankees slugger said, noting he skipped the 2023 WBC because he had just been named New York's captain and wanted to focus on that. This past season, Judge slugged 53 home runs and led baseball in batting average (.331), on-base percentage (.457), slugging percentage (.688), and WAR (9.7). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SP Paul Skenes, Pirates USA will have the reigning AL MVP in the lineup and the reigning National League Cy Young atop the rotation. Skenes, who pitched for Air Force before transferring to LSU, committed to USA in May. \"If I ever get the chance to do this, I'm never saying no,\" he said. With all due respect to Jake Peavy and Roger Clemens, who was nearing the end of his career in 2006, Skenes very well might be the best pitcher to ever suit up for USA in the WBC. He had a 1.97 ERA with 216 strikeouts in 187 ⅔ innings this season, and joined Doc Gooden as the only pitchers in history to win Rookie of the Year one year and Cy Young the next. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SS Bobby Witt Jr., Royals Bobby Baseball is returning to the WBC. Witt committed to USA in June and figures to their starting shortstop this time around. He was on the 2023 roster and was used primarily as a pinch-runner, going 1 for 2 with a double in his five appearances. \"It's a blast. These are the things you dream  of,\" Witt said about the 2023 WBC. Back then, he was heading into his sophomore season. This time around, Witt is a fully formed superstar. He authored a .295/.351/.501 slash line with 23 homers, 38 steals, and a league-leading 47 doubles in 2025. Witt finished fourth in the AL MVP voting and won his second straight Gold Glove. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     C Cal Raleigh, Mariners USA will have a 60-homer man behind the plate next spring. Raleigh set a new single-season home run record for a catcher and a switch-hitter in 2025, and was the runner-up to Judge for AL MVP. It will be his first WBC experience. \"I'm  just very honored that they would pick me and I'm  really looking forward to hopefully creating a memory and winning gold,\" Raleigh said in July. He led MLB in homers (60) and RBI (125) this past season while slashing .247/.359/.589 and playing excellent defense at the game's most demanding position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs Fresh off a 30-30 season, Crow-Armstrong and his Gold Glove defense will roam center field for USA in the WBC. His commitment to the event was confirmed in November. \"I love playing for my country more than anything,\" Crow-Armstrong said. PCA was a 6.0 WAR player in 2025 thanks to top of the line defense as well as his 31 homers and 35 steals. He joined Sammy Sosa as the only players in Cubs' history to go 30-30 and finished ninth in the NL MVP voting. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks USA's outfield will feature three All-Stars and three top-9 finishers in the MVP voting. Carroll will join Crow-Armstrong and Judge on the roster, he announced in November. \"It was not a hard decision. I couldn't be more excited. It's going to be awesome,\" Carroll said. He led the league in triples for the third year in a row in 2025, and hit .259/.343/.541 with 31 home runs and 32 steals. It was Carroll's first 30-30 season. He was an All-Star for the second time and he finished sixth in the NL MVP voting, his second time finishing that high (fifth in 2023). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     RP Garrett Whitlock, Red Sox One of the game's top right-handed relievers will be in USA's bullpen. Whitlock announced his commitment to USA on social media in November. It will be his first time playing in the tournament. After battling injuries and bouncing between the rotation and bullpen from 2022-24, Whitlock became a full-time reliever in 2025 and threw 72 innings with a 2.25 ERA and 91 strikeouts. He frequently worked multiple innings, which will come in handy in the early rounds of the WBC, when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Matthew Boyd, CubsAfter battling injury and inconsistency for the first decade of his MLB career, Boyd busted out with his first All-Star berth in 2025 at age 34. He announced Wednesday on Foul Territory that he'll be on Team USA for the WBC in 2026. Boyd returned from Tommy John surgery in 2024 with the Guardians and pitched to a 2.72 ERA in eight starts. It was good enough to earn a two-year, $29 million deal with an option for 2027 from the Cubs. In 2025, he went 14-8 with a 3.21 ERA and 154 strikeouts in 179 ⅔ innings. Upon his announcement, Boyd became the first left-handed pitcher on Team USA for this cycle and it seems pretty likely he'll be in the rotation for the event.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    OF/DH Kyle Schwarber, free agentSchwarber, one of the game's most productive hitters, hasn't yet chosen which team he'll suit up for during the coming regular season. He has, however, declared that he'll play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. Schwarber has averaged a 135 OPS+ with 47 home runs per season over the last three years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    C Will Smith, DodgersSmith, fresh off winning a second World Series title in a row, will be in the squat for Team USA as he pursues an international championship to add to his collection. Smith has developed into one of the best backstops in baseball and over the past three seasons has amassed a 125 OPS+ and 12 Wins Above Replacement.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    INF Gunnar Henderson, OriolesHenderson will be making his first WBC appearance after blossoming into a star with the Orioles in recent years. Over the course of his first four seasons in the majors, he's compiled a 134 OPS+ and more than 21 Wins Above Replacement. His experience at shortstop and third base could come in handy, depending on the rest of the roster.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2B Brice Turang, BrewersTurang is fresh off a breakout season with the Brewers that saw him post new career highs in home runs (18) and WAR (5.6). He's a high-quality defender capable of stealing a base as well, giving him a broad base of skills. Turang will be a weapon for USA regardless of whether he starts at second base, or comes off the bench to pinch-hit/pinch-run.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RP Garrett Cleavinger, RaysOne of the game's more underrated relievers, Cleavinger figures to be DeRosa's go-to lefty in the WBC. He threw 61 ⅓ innings with a 2.35 ERA in 2025, and struck out 33.7% of the batters he faced. That was a top-15 mark among relievers, and fourth highest among lefties. Cleavinger held same-side hitters to a .187 batting average and .274 on-base percentage this past season, his sixth in the majors and fourth with Tampa.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RP Griffin Jax, RaysJax, one of the most sought after relievers at the 2025 trade deadline, will be part of USA's bullpen in the WBC. The former Twin/current Ray had an unsightly 4.23 ERA this past season, though his underlying numbers are off the charts good. Jax's 35.0% strikeout rate and 18.1% swinging strike rate are among the very best in baseball thanks to a monster sweeper and upper-90s fastball. Few pitchers are as good at missing bats as Jax. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Nolan McLean, MetsUSA's rotation will include a leading candidate for 2026 NL Rookie of the Year. McLean made his MLB debut with the Mets this past August and dazzled down the stretch, pitching to a 2.06 ERA with 57 strikeouts in 48 innings. His deep six-pitch arsenal, which includes a mid-90s sinker and big-breaking sweeper, gives McLean the second-best pure stuff on USA's staff behind Skenes.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Clay Holmes, MetsHolmes, McLean's rotation mate in Queens, will also be on USA's roster. He made the transition from reliever to starter in 2025 and things went well: 3.53 ERA in 165 ⅔ innings. Given his experience as a reliever and ability to pitch multiple innings as a starter, Holmes would make for an interesting multi-inning relief weapon in the WBC, particularly when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits in the early rounds.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Joe Ryan, TwinsA top trade candidate this offseason, it's not clear if Ryan will be camp with the Twins or a different team in the spring, but he will be on USA's roster. The 29 year old had a 3.42 ERA in 171 innings in 2025 and was dominant in the first half before fading a bit down the stretch. He gives DeRosa and Team USA a worthy No. 2 behind Skenes in the rotation.\n            ",

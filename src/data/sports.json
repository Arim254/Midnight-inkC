    "body": "\n        The Brian Callahan era in Nashville is over. The Tennessee Titans have fired their coach following a 1-5 start, the team announced on Monday. This decision comes following a 20-10 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. Mike McCoy, the team's senior offensive assistant, has been named interim coach, CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirms.   McCoy was the coach of the Chargers from 2013-16.\"These decisions are never easy, and they become more difficult when they involve people of great character,\" said Chad Brinker, the team's president of football operations, in a statement. \"We are grateful for Brian's investment in the Titans and Tennessee community during his tenure as head coach. We thank him and his family for being exemplary ambassadors of the Tennessee Titans.\"While we are committed to a patient and strategic plan to build a sustainable, winning football program, we have not demonstrated sufficient growth. Our players, fans, and community deserve a football team that achieves a standard we are not currently meeting, and we are committed to making the hard decisions necessary to reach and maintain that standard.\"\n\n        \n            \n                NFL coaching hot seat rankings: With Brian Callahan out, is this the end for Mike McDaniel and Aaron Glenn?\n                \n                    Jeff Kerr                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCallahan, who was hired in January 2024 away from the Cincinnati Bengals after five seasons served as their offensive coordinator, went 4-19 with Tennessee. The offensive mind was brought in to replace Mike Vrabel and develop Tennessee's young quarterback, Will Levis. Instead, Levis took a step backwards behind one of the worst offensive lines in the NFL, and the Titans finished the 2024 season with a 3-14 record -- which earned them the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. There was again optimism entering this season with a new quarterback in Cameron Ward, but the Titans did not show progress. Through six weeks, Tennessee's offense ranks dead last in yards per game (232.3) and second-worst in points per game (13.8). Titans under Brian Callahan (since 2024)CategoryMetricNFL RankW-L4-19T-WorstPoints per game17.1T-30thPoints per game differential-9.931stTurnovers per game1.9WorstApart from the borderline unwatchable offense, Callahan also made several errors in situational football that drew the ire of the fan base. Week 1: The surrendering of a halftime lead During the Week 1 loss to the Denver Broncos, Callahan surrendered what could have been a surprising 6-3 halftime lead for Tennessee by calling three straight pass plays inside his own 10-yard line with 47 seconds remaining in the second quarter. Callahan had called the game conservatively up until that point, so it was a very strange time to get aggressive. The first two pass attempts fell incomplete, while Ward was sacked at his own 1-yard line on third down. The Titans then punted the ball away from their own goal line, giving Denver possession in field goal range. That short field set up the first touchdown of the game -- a Courtland Sutton score right before the halftime break. Instead of leading at the halftime break, the Titans trailed. Week 1: Not knowing the rules (allegedly) In that same Week 1 matchup, Callahan failed to challenge what was a catch by rookie wideout Elic Ayomanor. On a play in the third quarter, the wide receiver came down on his elbow in-bounds with possession of the ball, which is a catch. In his postgame press conference, Callahan said Ayomanor needed to get a foot in as well. This is incorrect, as the NFL rulebook (Section 1 Article 3) states a forward pass is completed if a player (2.) \"touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands.\"The next day, Callahan said he just misspoke, and was aware of the rule. \"I misspoke,\" Callahan said, via ESPN. \"I'm well aware of the rule, I understand how it works, and the way that I articulated it afterwards was incorrect. And I understand the rules of this game pretty well.\"Week 3: The K-Ball fiascoIn Week 3, the Titans were blown out at home by Daniel Jones and the Indianapolis Colts, 41-20. There was a very embarrassing sequence just before the halftime break in that matchup that upset everyone in Nissan Stadium. The Titans were facing a fourth-and-1 from the Colts' 39-yard line with 42 seconds remaining in the second quarter. The Colts then called a timeout. Callahan was unsure whether he was going to keep his offense on the field, so he ended up calling a timeout following the Colts' timeout. Tennessee sent out kicker Joey Slye to attempt a 57-yard field goal, but the \"K-Ball\" was not substituted in for Slye to kick. The Titans took a delay-of-game penalty, which pushed the field goal attempt back to 62 yards. Slye's kick was blocked, and the Colts took over at the Titans 48-yard line. Indy's offense quickly picked up 30 yards on four plays to set up a 36-yard field goal. Instead of Tennessee heading into the locker room trailing 17-9, the Titans were down 20-6.Week 4: The new play callerFollowing the loss to the Colts, Callahan gave up play-calling duties to quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree. The swap did not spark the Titans offense, as Tennessee scored zero points while picking up just 175 yards of total offense in a 26-0 loss to the Houston Texans. It marked the first shutout loss for the Titans since 2019, and the largest since the infamous 59-0 loss to the New England Patriots in 2009. This marked the 10th straight loss for the Titans, which tied the longest losing streak since the franchise moved to Tennessee.The Titans did earn their first win of the season in Week 5 thanks to a dramatic collapse by the Arizona Cardinals, who allowed 16 unanswered points in the fourth quarter. However, the Titans were unable to build on this newfound momentum against the Raiders on Sunday, as the offense went back to looking disjointed. Tennessee is the only NFL team to not have held a fourth quarter lead this season, and the 83 total points scored are the Titans' fewest through six games since 1985.Week 7: Titans fire Callahan during 'Vrabel week'It's worth mentioning that the Titans fired Callahan six days before welcoming their former lead man, Vrabel, back to Nashville, as the Titans will host the Patriots this Sunday. Tennessee made it so he will never have a chance to face the man that replaced him. \"Well, I think it's going to feel different, [but] it can't be different,\" Vrabel said of the looming Titans matchup Monday morning before the Callahan news broke. \"It has to be the way we prepare, the way that we try to put together a game plan. But ... we have to recognize the obvious, having spent time there. So [there's] a lot of people on the other side that I know that I coached or worked with.\"Not long ago, the Titans were the No. 1 seed in the AFC and beating Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes in back-to-back weeks. Since that 2021 season, the Titans are 17-40, and have fired two coaches and two general managers. It truly has been a titanic collapse. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Buffalo Bills will try to bounce back from their first loss of the season when they face the Atlanta Falcons in the first of two Monday Night Football games at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. The Bills (4-1) entered last week's Sunday Night Football game against the Patriots as the NFL's last remaining undefeated team but turned the ball over three times and lost 23-20. Meanwhile, the Falcons (2-2) are coming off their bye week. Prior to their bye, they beat the Commanders, 34-27.Despite the loss, Buffalo still has arguably the best offense in the league. Josh Allen & Co. lead the NFL in total offense (395.8 yards per game) and scoring offense (30.6 points per game) this season. In addition, the Bills have scored at least 30 points in eight straight games against NFC teams. That's the longest streak by any team all-time in interconference games.However, Buffalo will have to face a stingy Atlanta defense. The Falcons lead the NFL in both total defense (244.0 yards per game) and pass defense (135.0 yards per game). In the victory over Washington, Atlanta limited the Commanders to 147 passing yards. The Bills are 3.5-point favorites over the Falcons. In the second game on Monday, the Commanders (3-2) will host the Bears (2-2) in a rematch of one of last season's most improbable finishes. In Week 8 of last year, Noah Brown caught a 52-yard Hail Mary pass from Jayden Daniels as time expired to complete an 18-15 Washington victory. The Commanders would go on to reach the NFC Championship Game, while the setback began a 10-game losing streak for Chicago.Daniels & Co. enter Monday's game off a 27-10 victory over the Chargers. In that game, Washington rushed for 163 yards, averaging a robust 5.8 yards per carry. The Commanders boast the league's top rushing offense, which churns out 156.4 rushing yards per game. On Monday they have a plus matchup against a defense that allows 164.5 rushing yards per game, the second worst in the league. The Bears, who are riding a two-game winning streak, are rested after enjoying a bye in Week 5. Takeaways have been the catalyst behind the team's recent success. Chicago had four takeaways in each of those two wins over the Cowboys and Raiders. That was just the third time in the past 30 years that the Bears had back-to-back games with at least four takeaways.For Monday, Washington is a 5.5-point favorite over Chicago. While the Monday Night Football doubleheader is the marquee attraction on the sporting landscape on the day, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes the MLB playoffs.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Monday, Oct. 13.

White)\nBoth teams excel in primetime showdowns. Buffalo is 8-2 in its last 10 primetime games while Atlanta is 7-1 on Monday night since 2015, the second best Monday record in the league over that span. White notes the lookahead line for this game was Bills -5.5, which means Buffalo bettors are getting two points of value after a game in which the Bills committed three uncharacteristic turnovers. \"The Falcons defense has played well this year but has gotten to face J.J. McCarthy, Bryce Young and Marcus Mariota since giving up three TDs to Baker Mayfield in Week 1,\" White adds. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, gives Buffalo a 79% chance to win and assigns an \"A\" grade to Bills money line (-214).\nBears at CommandersTime: 8:15 p.m. | Location: Landover, Md. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Bears +206 | Expert: Commanders -4.5 (Larry Hartstein)\nThis game features the top two picks, Chicago's Caleb Williams and Washington's Jayden Daniels, from the 2024 NFL Draft. Williams, who was selected No. 1 overall, has a 7-14 record in his career and has 29 total touchdowns against 13 turnovers. Daniels is 14-6 with 35 touchdowns against nine turnovers. Hartstein notes Williams averaged just 5.9 yards per attempt in an easy matchup against the Raiders in his last game. \"This will be tougher, as Washington ranks No. 2 in pressure rate (46.9 percent),\" Hartstein says. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Bears have a 37% chance to win and gives a \"B\" grade to Chicago money line (+205).More NFL best betsBest sportsbook promos for Bills-Falcons, Bears-CommandersModel's anytime touchdown scorer props for Monday nightModel's longshot props for Monday nightWill Brinson's top Monday Night Football playsMLB best bets, where to watchALCS Game 2: Mariners at Blue JaysTime: 5:03 p.m. | Location: Toronto | TV: FOX/FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Mariners +112\nThe Seattle Mariners will try to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series when they face the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 2 at the Rogers Centre.

Polanco also drove in the winning run in the 15th inning in the team's Game 5 victory over the Tigers on Friday night. For Game 2 of the ALCS, Logan Gilbert (1-0, 1.13 ERA) will take the mound for Seattle while rookie Trey Yesavage (1-0, 0.00 ERA) gets the call for Toronto.

Meanwhile, the Dodgers have not played since Thursday when they eliminated the Phillies with a 2-1 win in Game 4. Blake Snell (2-0, 1.38 ERA) is set to take the mound for Los Angeles in Game 1, while Milwaukee has yet to name a starter. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Brewers a 57% chance to win and gives an \"A\" grade to Milwaukee money line (+128). In addition, Severance notes the Brewers went 6-0 against the Dodgers during the regular season. \"Blake Snell is terrific on the mound for the Dodgers but had some hiccups on the road during the regular season,\" he says.\n            ",

Aggies quarterback Logan Fife scored twice in last Thursday's win against Sam Houston in his most efficient outing of the season.

The Chippewas were unable to complete a comeback of their own at Akron, but they found something to build on with freshman running back Brock Townsend hitting 108 yards on just eight carries in the loss.\nWyoming vs. Air ForceDate: Saturday, Oct. 18 | Time: 3:30 p.m.Location: Falcon Stadium -- Colorado Springs, ColoradoTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder] Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports AppSpread: Air Force -5.5 | Will the Falcons cover? Check out SportsLine's Week 8 projections hereAir Force (1-5) can't seem to catch a break, dropping back-to-back games by a field goal. They'll look to end a five-game losing streak when they host Wyoming (3-3) Saturday afternoon. The Falcons missed a 40-yard field goal as time expired in a defeat at UNLV in Week 7. Despite scoring 20 points in the fourth quarter, it wasn't enough to secure the win. Meanwhile, the Cowboys found success of their own, holding off San Jose State to snap a three-game skid and get back in pursuit of the Mountain West leaders.\n            ",

Buffalo leads the league in total offense, averaging 395.8 yards per game. Quarterback Josh Allen has been spectacular this season, and he's completing 70.4% of his passes for 1,217 yards, nine touchdowns and just two interceptions. He's also racked up 212 rushing yards on 40 carries and three scores. The model projects the Bills to win in 78% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 68.55%, making this a valuable favorite to include with a pair of underdog picks in the model's Monday DraftKings parlay.Bears (+205) to defeat the CommandersChicago had an additional week to prepare for Washington while coming off a bye, and the model projects that to play to the Bears' advantage on Monday. After a slow start with two losses, largely due to defensive struggles with Chicago allowing 39.5 ppg over its first two contests, the Bears entered the bye week off back-to-back victories as the underdog in both contests. The Bears defeated the Cowboys, 31-14, in Week 3, followed by a 25-24 win over the Raiders. Chicago has the No. 10 scoring offense (25.3 ppg) this season. The model projects the Bears to win in 37% of simulations, however, with the implied odds of +205 signaling a 32.8% chance of victory, the model sees solid value in taking the shot of Chicago upsetting Washington.Brewers (+128) to defeat the DodgersThe Brewers are using the element of surprise to their advantage, not naming a Game 1 starter as of Monday morning, coming off their five-game series victory over the Cubs on Saturday. Milwaukee, which had the best record in baseball at 97-65 this season, knocked off the Cubs, 3-1, on Saturday to improve to 3-0 at home this postseason. The Brewers went 52-29 at home this season, and they will host the Dodgers on Monday. Regardless of who starts for the Brewers, they have the luxury of one of the top bullpens in baseball, ranking sixth in bullpen ERA (3.63) this season. The Brewers also had the No. 4 scoring offense (4.96 runs per game) this season. The model projects Milwaukee to win in 57% of simulations, showcasing strong plus-money value for Monday.Want more NFL picks for Monday Night Football and MLB picks?You've seen the model's Monday best bets.

The reigning NFL MVP remains one of the most impactful players in the game today. Allen's dual-threat ability makes him an elite red zone performer and give him a relatively high floor in all fantasy football formats.In 2025, Allen has gotten off to a solid start with 1,217 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and just two interceptions through five games.

The former USC standout enjoyed a breakout 2024 season, catching 100 passes for 1,271 yards and nine touchdowns, leading the Falcons in both catches and receiving yardage across all games. He was one of the only receivers in the league to record 100 receptions, 1,000 yards, and at least eight receiving touchdowns during the 2024 season. In 2025, through four games, London has 24 receptions for 269 yards and one touchdown, averaging 11.2 yards per catch. While his early-season numbers don't quite match the pace of 2024, he's remained a steady presence in Atlanta's passing game. London's size, route-running, and consistency keep him as one of the key targets and foundational pieces in the Falcons' offense this season.

    "body": "\n        Brian Branch has been suspended by the NFL for one game without pay for his actions following the Lions' loss to the Chiefs on Sunday night. The Lions' Pro Bowl defensive back initiated a fight between the two teams immediately following the Chiefs' 30-17 win when he punched Kansas City wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster. Branch, who will miss the Lions' upcoming home game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on \"Monday Night Football,\" stands to lose $76,624 for one one-game suspension. He is planning to appeal said suspension, according to NFL Media. Branch attributed his actions postgame to building frustration with Smith-Schuster during Sunday night's game. \"I did a real childish thing,\" Branch said. \"I'm tired of people doing stuff in between plays and refs don't catch it. They be trying to bully me out there. I shouldn't have did it, it was childish.\"\nLions coach Dan Campbell called Branch's actions \"inexcusable\" during his postgame press conference. He also apologized to Chiefs coach Andy Reid, who said during his postgame presser that Branch had some some \"pretty good damage\" to Smith-Schuster's nose without getting into specifics. \"You guys saw it,\" Reid said. \"The guy came up and hit JuJu for what looked like no reason.\"\n        \n            \n                Lions DB Brian Branch expresses remorse after fight with Chiefs WR Juju Smith-Schuster\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who attempted to shake Branch's hand prior to things going awry, didn't hold back when asked about what happened immediately after the game. \n\"We play the game in between the whistles,\" Mahomes told NBC Sports. \"They can do all the extra curricular stuff in between the whistles. I thought we played a great game today. And we'll keep this momentum moving forward.\" Now in his third season, this is already the 14th time Branch has been fined by the NFL and the fourth time he has been fined this season. Branch's previous fined cost him nearly $130,000 in salary. Assuming his suspension holds up, Branch will not be available for Detroit's playoff rematch against the Buccaneers. Branch's absence is an obvious blow for the Lions, who have the unenviable task of trying to slow down Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield.

    "body": "\n        Ace Bailey, or at least his former representation, seemingly did everything possible to not get drafted by the Utah Jazz. Bailey reportedly had \"preferred\" destinations which may or may not have influenced a few teams that were in position to take him in June's draft. But Utah decided the talent was too great to pass up -- even against the looming threat of Bailey not reporting to camp or just being a general malcontent -- and took him with the No. 5 overall pick. So far, this looks to have been a very smart decision. For starters, there have been nothing but positive reports about Bailey's attitude. Teammate Kyle Anderson has called Bailey's positivity \"infectious,\" while coach Will Hardy has praised the 19-year-old's \"willingness to ask questions\" and ability to \"see the game and learn on the fly.\"With the obvious qualifier that we're talking about preseason basketball, and just two games at that, Bailey has looked extraordinary on the court so far. Over 70 minutes against the Rockets and Spurs, Bailey has put up 45 points on 19-of-29 shooting. Impressive numbers, obviously. But it's the way those shots are coming, within what is clearly a concerted effort on the part of the Jazz to put Bailey in his most optimal scoring positions, that is putting to bed what was one of the universal concerns about his game in college. \nThat concern was that his offense came very hard. Everything was contested. Part of this was because Rutgers, outside of No. 2 overall pick Dylan Harper, didn't have anyone capable of drawing defensive attention away from Bailey. But it was also a problem that Bailey was so bothered by the pressure he did face. Now, when we say bothered, it doesn't mean he couldn't score against pressure. He could. And he can. Bailey's ability to bail himself out with tough shots was perhaps the biggest feather in his draft cap. But in the NBA, making tough shots off whirling spins into mid-range fades cannot be the first page of your survival guide. Sustained, efficient scoring only happens when you are operating in breathable enough airspace to access consistently clean looks.  If you can't cleanly and consistently create that space for yourself, via your own handle (which is something we know Bailey has thus far struggled to do, as evidenced by his alarmingly high turnover rate against pressure in college), then it has to be created for you. And that's what the Jazz are doing for Bailey. \nRather than asking him to start from a stationary position and create advantages in isolation, the Jazz are putting Bailey on the move so that by the time he catches the ball he is either already in, or quickly moving toward, open space. From there, he only requires one or two pressure-free dribbles to get right into a clean shot. This approach was on beautiful display in Bailey's preseason debut against the Rockets. \nIn Game 2, it was more of the same against the Spurs. \nWhat you'll notice is that in all those buckets, only one came out of isolation (and even in that one he got to his spot at the elbow with exquisite efficiency and footwork, requiring just three dribbles punctuated by a luscious spin move). In fact, Bailey has needed just 28 total dribbles to get off his 29 preseason shots so far. \nYou don't have to be a genius to do the math here. That's fewer than one dribble per shot. That is prime Klay Thompson stuff. Bailey isn't the all-time distant threat Thompson is and he's a better athlete, but the common theme between the two is that they're at their best when they're catching balls on the move rather than starting from scratch. Bailey may well evolve as an individual creator (in fact, he almost certainly will), and when he does it should allow him to get to the rim and free-throw line more. Some people are already saying they see a young T-Mac, which is lofty but perhaps not unwarranted. But for now, Bailey is clearly most comfortable as a mid-range scorer on minimal dribbling (a more athletic Rip Hamilton should have everyone in Utah very excited), and it cannot be overstated how smart it is that the Jazz are positioning him in accordance with that talent until the rest of his arsenal comes around. \n            ",

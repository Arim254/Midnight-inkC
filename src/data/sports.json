    "body": "\nWith the international break wrapped up, Arsenal, which sits atop the Premier League standings, is back in action on Saturday, Oct. 18, against Fulham for Matchday 8. The Gunners sit just ahead of Liverpool atop the table, and they'll look to extend their lead on Saturday. Fulham has logged eight points so far this season, which is exactly half of Arsenal's 16 to date.Kickoff from Craven Cottage in London is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. In the latest Fulham vs. Arsenal odds at DraftKings Sportsbook, the hosts are +500 on the money line (wager $100 to win $500) while the visitors are -195 favorites (wager $195 to win $100). The draw is priced at +350. The total is set at 2.5 (Over -105, Under -120). In the latest SportsLine Projection Model results, Arsenal win in 54% of simulations and the total goes Over 2.5 in 56% of simulations, good for an \"A\" grade from the model. Before locking in your bets for Fulham vs. Arsenal, you'll want to see what expert Martin Green is locking in for this match.After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer betting picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), EFL Cup (+4.47), FA Cup (+3.07) and Champions League (+3.05), among others. Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis   for Fulham vs. Arsenal on Saturday.Fulham vs. Arsenal picksArsenal to win and Under 4.5 goals (-120): 1uBukayo Saka to score or assist (-120): 0.5uArsenal will face a stern test of their title credentials when they lock horns with Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday. The Gunners surged to the top of the Premier League table after beating West Ham 2-0 earlier this month. They're on a four-game winning streak in all competitions, so they will carry a great deal of momentum into this match.However, Craven Cottage has been an unhappy hunting ground for Mikel Arteta's men in recent years. The Gunners have dropped points on their last two visits to Fulham, a 1-1 draw last season and a damaging 2-1 defeat in the 2023-24 campaign. Arsenal's players will be desperate to win this game, as it would send a message to their title rivals. It won't be easy, as Fulham are unbeaten at home this season but the Gunners should ultimately have enough firepower to get the job done.Can Arsenal clinch another symbolic win?Arsenal have earned more points than any other Premier League team over the last three seasons, but the title has eluded them. The Gunners finished second to Man City in 2022-23 and 2023-24, and then finished second to Liverpool last season. The club responded by embarking on a £250 million ($336 million) spending spree in the summer. They signed eight new players, including striker Viktor Gyökeres, holding midfielder Martin Zubimendi, playmaker Eberechi Eze and winger Noni Madueke. These players are all at the peak of their powers. The message was clear: this club is no longer building for the future. The Gunners have made a flying start to the season. They're top of the Premier League, with five wins, one draw, and one defeat from seven games. That's an impressive record, as they've already faced Man City at home and Liverpool, Man United and Newcastle on the road. They've also won both Champions League games so far and they beat Port Vale in the EFL Cup.Crucially, Arsenal have been beating teams that they tend to struggle against. In their last two league games, they secured a 2-1 away win against Newcastle and a 2-0 home victory over West Ham. Both wins were important, as they'd lost their previous three away games against Newcastle and their last two home games against the Hammers. The sportsbooks now make Arsenal the clear favorites to finally win the Premier League title this season. If the Gunners can clinch another symbolic victory over Fulham on Saturday, they will move four points clear of Liverpool at the top of the table. The stakes are high.Silva makes Fulham hard to beatFulham operate on a far tighter budget than Arsenal. The Cottagers only made one major signing this summer, bringing in Brazilian winger Kevin from Shakhtar Donetsk. They're always cautious in the transfer market, but they still have a remarkable knack of finishing mid-table each season. Fulham never seem to be genuine contenders to finish in the European places, but they're never in relegation danger either. That's largely down to the tactical prowess of manager Marco Silva. He is arguably the club's greatest asset, and he makes the Cottagers hard to beat. Fulham are currently 14th in the table with two wins, two draws, and three defeats from seven games so far. That's the sort of record we've come to expect from Silva's team. However, they're unbeaten at home with two wins and a draw. Fulham held Man United to a 1-1 draw, before beating Leeds 1-0 and Brentford 3-1 at Craven Cottage. That highlights the scale of the task facing Arsenal this weekend. The Gunners will be without their captain and creator-in-chief Martin Ødegaard. He's injured, along with Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, and Madueke. Yet Arsenal should still have enough quality to unlock this Fulham defense, with the in-form Bukayo Saka leading the charge. It could be a close game, as Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno tends to excel against Arsenal (his former club), but the Gunners should ultimately clinch a narrow victory.\n            ",

Ole Miss is coming off a 24-21 win over Washington State last weekend, while Georgia downed Auburn 20-10. The Rebels (6-0, 3-0 SEC), who are looking to win the SEC title outright for the first time since 1963, are 1-0 on the road this year.

Since taking over for an injured Austin Simmons, Ole Miss hasn't missed a beat. Chambliss has completed 85 of 130 passes for 1,286 yards and seven touchdowns with one interception and a 164.7 rating. He also is second on the team in rushing, carrying 61 times for 281 yards (4.6 average) and three touchdowns. In the win over Washington State, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 253 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for another score.

    "body": "\nThere was heavy movement in the NBA offseason, particularly in the frontcourt, with old faces in new places. Kevin Durant, Myles Turner, Kristaps Porzingis and Michael Porter Jr. were among those on the move, which should affect one's 2025 Fantasy basketball strategy. Players on the move often have their stats either increase or decrease compared to team holdovers, who have less variance year over year. Thus, there's just as good a chance that any of them end up as a Fantasy basketball sleeper as there is they end up a Fantasy basketball 2025 bust.Paul George was one of the latter last year, while Karl-Anthony Towns and Josh Giddey excelled in new locations. In addition to projecting busts and sleepers, you also have to be aware of which up-and-comers could emerge as 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts before going on the clock. Before making any 2025-26 Fantasy basketball picks, be sure to check out the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings and cheat sheets from the proven computer model at SportsLine.LIMITED TIME: Use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1 JOIN NOW. SportsLine's proven model simulates each season 10,0000 times. This model is powered by the same people who powered projections for all three major Fantasy sites. These cheat sheets and rankings, available for leagues on many major sites, are updated multiple times every day. Last year the model called a breakout season for Stephon Castle, predicting that he would finish 25 spots ahead of consensus ADP at his position. The result: Castle won NBA Rookie of the year honors after averaging 14.7 points, 4.1 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game and finished as the No. 51 guard in average Fantasy points per game. The model also nailed James Harden as a sleeper last year before he put together his first All-Star season in three years and called Paolo Banchero's and Victor Wembanyama's breakout seasons before they went on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors as well.Now, SportsLine has simulated the entire NBA season 10,000 times and released its latest Fantasy basketball rankings 2025-26, along with plenty of sleepers, breakouts and busts. Head to SportsLine now to see these 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings.   Top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers  One of the top 2025 Fantasy basketball sleepers the model is predicting: Milwaukee Bucks guard Kevin Porter Jr., who is barely being picked in the top 100 picks in many drafts. Despite struggling from deep through the first 45 games of last season with the Los Angeles Clippers, he turned things around in a big way once he was acquired by the Bucks. He finished the regular season connecting on 40.8% of his 3-pointers in his final 30 games with Milwaukee, averaging 11.7 points per game.In the postseason, he continued to light it up from deep, hitting on 46.7% of his 3-pointers, averaging 11.2 points in five games. Porter is expected to be the Bucks' starting point guard, and is just one of two players on the 2025-26 roster to average 2.9 assists or more. For his career, Porter has averaged 4.6 assists per game. See more Fantasy basketball sleepers 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts  One of the 2025 Fantasy basketball breakouts the model has identified: Jazz point guard Isaiah Collier. The former No. 1 overall recruit was the penultimate pick in the first round of last year's draft and began his rookie year as a reserve. He quickly ascended to the starting point guard position and upped his scoring average over each of the last four months of the season. He also averaged 6.3 assists for the season, which was 16th in the NBA as he was the only first-year player to rank in the top 50 in assists.Coming off a franchise-worst 65-loss season, Utah is clearly in its rebuilding phase, and Collier is one of the cornerstones of that effort. Thus, he will be given lots of court time to establish himself as, potentially, Utah's point guard of both the present and the future. Add in that he plays for a Jazz team which loves to get up and down the court -- ranking fifth in pace last year -- and Collier is poised to pile up stats and make a name for himself this season. Identify other Fantasy basketball breakouts 2025 here. Top 2025 Fantasy basketball busts As for players to avoid, the model lists Pelicans guard Jordan Poole as a Fantasy basketball bust. Poole was acquired by the New Orleans Pelicans from the Washington Wizards during the offseason. Despite his somewhat lofty numbers, he finds himself in a situation where he needs to be a complementary piece to Zion Williamson. He also may have to take a lesser role behind New Orleans' two lottery picks in Derik Queen and Jeremiah Fears. If they emerge in their rookie seasons, Poole could definitely see his production go down.Poole is being picked in the seventh round, according to the latest ADP, but he may not be worth taking. In fact, SportsLine's model has players such as Jrue Holiday and Immanuel Quickly, both of whom are projected by many to be picked later, as better values. Avoid these 2025 Fantasy basketball busts as well. How to find proven 2025-26 Fantasy basketball rankings SportsLine is also extremely high on a surprising forward you aren't even thinking about being taken in the early rounds of 2025 Fantasy basketball drafts. This player is a top-3 Fantasy option at his position and is ranked ahead of stars like Kevin Durant and Paolo Banchero. You can only see who it is, and the 2025 Fantasy basketball rankings for every player, at SportsLine.So which 2025-26 Fantasy basketball sleepers, breakouts and busts should you target and fade, and which forward shocks the NBA as a top-3 player in positional rankings? Visit SportsLine now to get 2025-26 Fantasy basketball cheat sheets for every single position, all from the model that's nailed its Fantasy basketball picks, and find out.\n            ",

No. 10 LSU (5-1, 2-1 SEC) is coming off a 20-10 victory over South Carolina, with the Tigers' lone loss of the year coming in Week 5 versus Ole Miss. No. 17 Vanderbilt had a bye last Saturday and dropped its only game of the season the prior week to Alabama. The Tigers prevailed when these teams met last season, winning 24-17, in Baton Rouge, La. LSU lists defensive end Jimari Butler and linebacker Whit Weeks as questionable. Vanderbilt linebacker Langston Patterson and defensive lineman Linus Zunk are both probable. Kickoff is at noon ET from FirstBank Stadium in Nashville, Tenn.

LSU held Vandy to just 17 points in last year's meeting, despite the Tigers having the 59th-ranked scoring defense in FBS, while this year's unit ranks fifth-best. The Tigers are allowing just 11.8 points and can completely shut down passing attacks. DC Blake Baker's aggressive scheme has led LSU to pick off twice as many passes (eight) as it has touchdown passes allowed (four).That side of the ball should cause issues for Vanderbilt, which has struggled against top competition this year. The Commodores' two lowest yardage totals came in their two SEC contests, with them averaging just 328 total yards in those games. LSU quarterback, Garrett Nussmeier, had 332 passing yards alone in LSU's victory over Vanderbilt last season. He should be complemented by a productive run game on Saturday, as Vandy has allowed 132.5 rushing yards over its last two games, compared to just 70 rushing yards over its first four games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Vanderbilt can coverBehind quarterback Diego Pavia, the Commodores rank seventh in the nation with 43.2 points per game. Pavia ranks second in the SEC in passing touchdowns (14), completion percentage (71.4) and passer efficiency rating (168.7).

But for Week 7, I couldn't decide who I like more out of Quinshon Judkins and Jacory Croskey-Merritt. So let's feature both.Judkins ($6,000 on DraftKings and $7,400 on FanDuel) should dominate the Dolphins at home. Miami is No. 7 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and Rico Dowdle and Kimani Vidal have combined for 41 carries for 330 yards and a touchdown, and six catches for 42 yards and a touchdown on eight targets against the Dolphins in the past two games.Croskey-Merritt ($6,100 on DraftKings and $6,600 on FanDuel) also should perform well against the Cowboys. Dallas is No. 3 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, and the past three opposing running backs against the Cowboys (Josh Jacobs, Breece Hall, and Rico Dowdle) have each gained at least 150 total yards.I'm expecting both running backs to be popular given their matchups, but I don't care. Judkins and Croskey-Merritt should be two of the top performers in Week 7, and I want them on my rosters on DraftKings and FanDuel.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 7, click on this link to SportsLine For more of my DFS plays for Week 7, click on this link to SportsLine.

Couple that with a number of upsets, including the Thursday night New York Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles 34-17, and many survivor pool players' hopes are in tatters. For those still alive, this week's schedule does give them a number of options to be able to move on. Among the likely targets for NFL survivor players this week include Packers vs. Cardinals (+6.5), Buccaneers vs. Lions (-5.5) on 'Monday Night Football', Broncos (-7) vs. Giants and Mike Vrabel's return to Tennessee in Patriots (-7) vs. Titans.Meanwhile, the Kansas City Chiefs will look to battle their way back to the top of the AFC West standings when they take on the visiting Las Vegas Raiders. Las Vegas is 2-4 on the year and fourth in the AFC West, while the Chiefs are third at 3-3. Kansas City enters as an 11.5-point favorite, the largest line of the week, so the Chiefs will be an appealing option for those who can still use them.

The Packers are 6.5-point and -341 money-line favorites, making them one of four teams favored by more than a touchdown this week. The Cardinals are on a four-game losing streak, but they haven't lost by more than a field goal during that span. Kyler Murray (foot) is officially listed as questionable after missing last week's game. Even if he can't go, Jacoby Brissett is a very competent backup.

The win wouldn't have been possible without the late heroics of linebacker T.J. Capers, who made an incredible defensive play in the final minute.With Miami facing third-and-1 from the Louisville 31-yard line and 36 seconds remaining, quarterback Carson Beck tried to throw a quick pass near the sideline to move the chains. The ball was deflected at the line of scrimmage, and Capers somehow came down with the interception to seal the game.The pick gave Louisville its first-ever road win over an AP top-five opponent.\nMiami (5-1, 1-1 ACC) entered as the favorite to win the ACC crown, but the loss complicates its path to the conference title game. The Hurricanes remain the betting favorite at +260, per FanDuel, ahead of Georgia Tech (+370) and Virginia (+400). Notably, Miami doesn't face either of those teams during the regular season.While Miami's title hopes remain intact, Beck's Heisman campaign took a major hit. The senior finished 25 of 35 for 271 yards and four interceptions. Beck opened the week as the Heisman favorite at 3/1 but dropped to 40/1 following the loss.\nLouisville (5-1, 2-1) heads to Boston College next Saturday before closing ACC play with games against Virginia Tech, Cal, Clemson and SMU. The Cardinals, now listed at 6/1, have the fifth-best odds to win the ACC after the upset — one fueled by Capers' game-clinching defensive gem.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Serie A is back this weekend after the second international break of the season and there are some big matches this week that could define the next few weeks of action, starting with Saturday's key game at the Stadio Olimpico between AS Roma and Inter. Even if this is only the seventh matchday of the 2025-26 season, we can already make some early statements on what we've learnt so far from the big teams and beyond. Let's take a look at some of the winners and losers: \n        \n            \n                How to watch Serie A on Paramount+, live stream: AS Roma face Inter in huge clash; Milan welcome Fiorentina\n                \n                    Francesco Porzio                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAllegri and Pulisic new roleDespite the injury that USMNT star Christian Pulisic suffered during the international break against Australia that might forced him to be out for around one month, the start of the season for the American international under Massimiliano Allegri's management has been phenomenal. During the first eight matches of the season between Serie A and Coppa Italia, Pulisic scored six goals and provided two assists to his teammates, leading AC Milan to five Serie A wins and topping the Serie A standings as of now. Allegri's tactical decision to move him further up the pitch in a 3-5-2 system, pairing him with the central striker, has proven to be one of the Italian manager's smartest moves, significantly boosting Pulisic's performances. The only concern now is that his injury doesn't affect his momentum. Grade: A+Fiorentina's terrible start to the season If we were able to predict almost all the teams and their potential before the start of the season, we couldn't imagine such a slow start for the team coached by Stefano Pioli, who will be back on Sunday at San Siro facing his former club, AC Milan. Fiorentina are still waiting for their first win of the season, with three draws and three defeats in the opening six matches of the Serie A season. Pioli's side will also have to cope with the loss of their key striker, Moise Kean, who sustained a muscle injury during the international break while playing for Italy against Estonia. Grade: F\nPio Esposito's impact for InterSpeaking of Italian strikers, Francesco Pio Esposito's impact in his Serie A debut season has been outstanding. The 20-year old already scored his first Serie A goal with Inter against Cagliari and he's one of the biggest surprises of the new season as he was immediately able to be part of the rotation for the new Inter coach, Cristian Chivu. With an injury to Marcus Thuram, he's now expected to be even more part of the team's plans, as Inter will be playing seven matches in the next 24 days and players like Yann Bonny and Esposito will be called to cope with the absence of the French striker, alongside Inter captain Lautaro Martinez. Grade: B+\n        \n            \n                Who is Francesco Pio Esposito?

The Danish player already scored four goals in the opening six matches he played for Napoli, and was able to make Antonio Conte and the fans forget about injured striker Romelu Lukaku, who is not expected to be back before the next year. Hojlund has had an incredible impact at Napoli, showing that probably his disappointing Manchester United stint when he couldn't score and deliver wasn't down to his ability, but rather the circumstances. Grade: A+\nMcKennie's relationship with TudorJuventus midfielder Weston McKennie is once again fully part of the rotation of the team coached by Igor Tudor, despite the usual summer rumors and a contract expiring in the summer of 2026, when he will represent the USMNT at the 2026 World Cup. Speaking to TNT, the American international underlined his relationship with the Croatian manager. \"I had a long preseason and I had a discussion with Tudor, who really put me under pressure. He said, 'Hey, you're getting older and your body won't be able to recover from matches like you used to. You need to lose some weight. That's the only way you'll be involved in this team.' I put my head down, worked out as usual, and went on a diet. I don't snack as much anymore, and if I do, they're healthy snacks. No more bad snacks. I'm also training more often. And I'm running a lot. This summer is the first summer I didn't mind taking my shirt off at the pool!\" So far it's working and this is just great news for the USMNT and Mauricio Pochettino heading to a key season. Grade: B\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Texas Tech quarterback Will Hammond will make his first career start Saturday when the No. 7 Red Raiders travel to face Arizona State in one of the biggest games of the Big 12 season, according to CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz and Chris Hummer. Typical starter Behren Morton left last week's win over Kansas with a lower leg injury and not practice this week in advance of the matchup with the Sun Devils.Hammond appeared in each of Texas Tech's first six games this season, on three occasions filling in for an injured Morton. He played extensively against Arkansas-Pine Bluff, Utah and Kansas and was more than serviceable in the role, combining for six total touchdowns in the three spots. He was excellent on the road against Utah, completing 13 of 16 passes for 169 yards and two touchdowns to go with 61 yards rushing. For the season, Hammond is a 66.7% passer with 411 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions. The dual-threat weapon also has 231 yards and four additional scores on the ground in the first half of the season.Morton departed from last week's contest early in the second quarter after Kansas edge rusher Leroy Harris III sacked him and landed on his lower leg. He was ruled out for the game and watched the final two-plus quarters in street clothes on the sideline.\n        \n            \n                Texas Tech loses DT Skyler Gill-Howard, a top player on the Big 12's best defense, for season to injury\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile injuries limited Morton to just three complete games in the front half of the campaign, he has excelled when he on the field. The fifth-year veteran leads the Big 12 in yards per attempt and boasts 13 touchdowns to three interceptions as the catalyst behind the nation's second-highest scoring offense and third-best passing attack.\nThis is the second major blow to Texas Tech this week. Standout defensive lineman Skyler Gill-Howard was ruled out for the year with an injury he also sustained in the win over Kansas. The Red Raiders' defensive front has been among the nation's most formidable units this season but will miss Gill-Howard dearly as he grades as the fourth-best defensive tackle in the country, per Pro Football Focus.The Red Raiders, 6.5-point favorites at FanDuel, battle with Arizona State at 4:30 p.m. ET on Saturday in a clash between a rising Big 12 power and the reigning conference champion. \nTexas Tech remains unbeaten while Arizona State, already with a conference loss, has minimal margin for error in its quest for a repeat title.\n            \n    ",

But there is one battle which may come down to the final day of play, and that's the award for most valuable player.Lionel Messi won it last season, and he's likely the frontrunner for the award again this season, but it's the final day that anyone can make an impression for the award. Obviously the MVP is not an award that can be won in one day, depending on how things break, Anders Dreyer's San Diego FC could win the Western Conference, which changes the view on his excellent season. Joining from Anderlecht in Belgium, the 27-year-old winger has taken the league by storm with 17 goals and 18 assists so far, leading San Diego's attack. From coming up in big moments to consistency, Dreyer has done it all while featuring in every game for the club this season. Alone, that'd seem like enough to win the MVP award, but that's how things shift in a league where Messi exists.With 26 goals and 18 assists, Messi leads the league in goal contributions by a significant margin. And unlike last season, he doesn't have competition from his own team in the Golden Boot standings. Luis Suarez has taken a step back, and Miami has returned to being the Messi show first, second and third. What's more. the Argentine has done this while only featuring in 27 of Miami's matches. But that means that Messi could end the season scoring a goal per game before even taking into account assists. At times, the fact that MLS counts secondary assists in their official statistics can make things seem inflated, but that only adds three assists to Messi's total. There's a chance that Messi won't win the Golden Boot with Denis Bouanga (24 goals) and Sam Surridge (23 goals) bearing down, but even so, he's already outdone is previous MVP season where he had 21 goals and 11 assists. This is unheard of production in the league, and it's why it'll be hard to deny Messi another MVP award once the season has come and gone. The Messi effect may make these things seem normal, but they most certainly aren't, which is why the Argentine stands in a class of his own.MLS Decision Day schedule All times Eastern, all matches available on MLS Season Pass\nSaturday, October 18 Atlanta United vs. D.C.

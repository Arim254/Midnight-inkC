He previously spent multiple seasons as an assistant at Michigan. The sexual assault allegations stem from his time with the Wolverines, and the Ann Arbor Police Department confirmed to ESPN that it is investigating the claims against Lewis. After a college career at Tennessee, Lewis went undrafted in 2017 before having brief stints with the then-Oakland Raiders, Houston Texans and Tennessee Titans. His playing career ended following one season with the XFL's Houston Roughnecks in 2020. \nLewis broke into coaching at Akron in 2020 as a graduate assistant. He then spent one season at South Alabama and another at Wake Forest before joining then-Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh's staff at Michigan ahead of the 2023 season.\n            \n",

Jiri Prochazka and Carlos Ulberg will battle for the vacant light heavyweight championship inside Kaseya Center in Miami on April 11. UFC president and CEO Dana White made the fight official with an announcement on Friday night.The title was vacated by Alex Pereira, who was on his second run as light heavyweight champion after having previously held the middleweight title, in anticipation of a move to the heavyweight division.Prochazka is aiming for his own second stint as champion at 205 pounds, having previously won the title with a win over Glover Teixeira at UFC 275. Prochazka lost the belt in his first defense, suffering a TKO defeat to Pereira. Prochazka then lost a rematch for the title against Pereira two fights later.Prochazka has been perfect in his UFC career outside of the two defeats to Pereira, compiling a 6-2 record in the Octagon with all victories coming via stoppage. He has won back-to-back fights, stopping Jamahal Hill via TKO and then scoring a dramatic comeback knockout of Khalil Rountree Jr. this past October.\nUlberg stumbled in his UFC debut, suffering a knockout loss to Kennedy Nzechukwu. Since that loss, Ulberg has rattled off nine consecutive victories, most recently knocking out Dominick Reyes in a UFC Fight Night main event.\nProchazka and Ulberg sit at No. 2 and 3, respectively, in the official UFC light heavyweight rankings, sitting only behind No. 1 Magomed Ankalaev.Prochazka vs. Ulberg tops a card that also includes a flyweight title defense between champion Joshua Van and challenger Tatsuro Taira.White also announced on Friday that former Bellator two-division champion Patricio Pitbull would return in Miami to take on a familiar name in Aaron Pico as both men spent years with the promotion. The two will meet at featherweight on the prelims. \nHere's how the rest of the card shakes out.UFC 327 fight cardJiri Prochazka vs. Carlos Ulberg, vacant light heavyweight championshipJoshua Van (c)\tvs.\tTatsuro Taira, flyweight championshipCurtis Blaydes\tvs.\tJosh Hokit, heavyweightsBeneil Dariush vs. Manuel Torres, lightweightsDominick Reyes vs. Johnny Walker, light heavyweightsAzamat Murzakanov vs. Paulo Costa, light heavyweightsPatricio Pitbull vs. Aaron Pico, featherweightsMatuesz Gamrot vs. Esteban Ribovics, lightweightsCub Swanson vs. Nate Landwehr, featherweightsKevin Holland\tvs.\tRandy Brown, welterweightsKelvin Gastelum vs. Vicente Luque, welterweightsTatiana Suarez\tvs.\tLoopy Godinez, women's strawweightsKyle Daukaus\tvs.\tVicente Luque, middleweights Christopher Alvidrez vs. Francisco Prado welterweights\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Road to WrestleMania has reached its final prelude. WWE has just one PPV left before the greatest show of them all in April and that's the Elimination Chamber. WWE returns to Chicago on Saturday night for the epic event where two superstars will punch their ticket to WrestleMania 42 by outlasting five others inside the sadistic structure. The men's match has some massive names looking to return to a headlining role at WrestleMania (Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Jey Uso) but it also has some men looking to make their mark and earn their first headlining spot (LA Knight, Je'Von Evans and Trick Williams).On the women's side, four former champions are set to compete in Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka while two newer competitors look to make a splash in Kiana James and Raquel Rodriguez.\nThe other two matches are near and dear to the fans in Chicago. World heavyweight champion CM Punk puts his title on the line in front of his hometown fans when he takes on Finn Balor. And Punk's wife, AJ Lee, challenges Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental title in her first singles match in more than a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Saturday with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.\nElimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Jey Uso: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw. Williams earned the penultimate spot by beating Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest. Uso was the final man to qualify, partially as a result of a legitimate injury suffered by Bronson Reed during the qualifying match against Uso and El Grande Americano.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.Elimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie. James snuck a pinfall over Charlotte Flair in their match with Nia Jax. Rodriguez has the chance to join Judgment Day Liv Morgan in challenging for a world championship at WrestleMania after defeating Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane in the final qualifier.\n            ",

There may be only one tight end to hear his name called Thursday night in April, but the group as a whole impressed Friday in Indianapolis.In total, 27 tight ends participated at this year's event, forming the fastest group ever at the annual showcase. Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq and Vanderbilt's Eli Stowers also pushed the boundaries in the vertical and broad jumps.CBS Sports grades the top tight end prospects while also highlighting other standouts.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23–25 in Pittsburgh. You can find more draft coverage at CBSSports.com, including weekly mock drafts and regular evaluations of the top prospects.\nGrading top TE prospects\nMeasurables: 6-foot-3⅛, 241 pounds, 10-inch hands, 31½-inch arm length, 78¼-inch wingspanTesting: 4.39-second 40-yard dash, 1.54-second 10-yard split, 43.5-inch vertical jump, 11-foot-1 broad jumpGrade: A+ -- Kenyon Sadiq tied an NFL combine record for tight ends with a 43.5-inch vertical jump, only for Vanderbilt's Eli Stowers to shatter the mark minutes later. Sadiq also recorded an 11-foot-1 broad jump and blistered the track with a 4.39-second 40-yard dash, the latter setting an NFL combine record at the position. Since 2003, only three players -- Nick Emmanwori, DK Metcalf and Sadiq -- have run sub-4.4 seconds in the 40-yard dash, posted a 40-plus-inch vertical and recorded an 11-plus-foot broad jump at 220-plus pounds, per NFL Research. Sadiq is the heaviest player to accomplish the feat.It would have been ideal if he were a little bigger, but it was an overall impressive display of athletic potential. Sadiq has cemented his case to be the first tight end off the board and likely a top-half first-round pick.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-3¾, 239 pounds, 9⅝-inch hands, 32⅝-inch arm length, 79¾-inch wingspanTesting: 4.51-second 40-yard dash, 1.59-second 10-yard split, 45.5-inch vertical jump, 11-foot-3 broad jumpGrade: A -- Eli Stowers set the NFL combine record for a tight end in the vertical jump (45.5 inches). He also posted an 11-foot-3 broad jump and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.51 seconds. Although a bit on the lighter side, no one -- except for Sadiq — did a better job showcasing their athletic potential. Stowers all but guaranteed he will hear his name called on Day 2 of the NFL Draft.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-4⅜, 246 pounds, 9⅛-inch hands, 32⅛-inch arm length, 77⅞-inch wingspanTesting: Did not participate in on-field testingGrade: B -- Max Klare did not run or participate in athletic testing but took part in drills. In the gauntlet, in particular, Klare did a solid job snatching the ball away from his body while barely drifting down the line. It was not an overwhelming day for the potential TE2, but he also did not hurt his stock. Ohio State's pro day will be important for his testing.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-5, 245 pounds, 9½-inch hands, 31⅝-inch arm lengthTesting: Did not participate in on-field testingGrade: N/A -- During a routine X-ray, Oscar Delp learned he had played the entire season with a hairline fracture in his foot and would not be able to participate in the combine. It was a disappointing development for a player who had prepared to make a strong statement in Indianapolis.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-4⅝, 245 pounds, 9⅝-inch hands, 31⅛-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.62-second 40-yard dash, 1.59-second 10-yard split, 36-inch vertical jump, 9-foot-11 broad jumpGrade: B+ -- Blocking is not Jack Endries' forte, but he did a nice job in that drill. He also hugged the line well in the gauntlet drill and displayed reliable hands.\nOther standoutsJohn Michael Gyllenborg, WyomingMeasurables: 6-foot-5¾, 249 pounds, 10-inch hands, 31-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.60-second 40-yard dash, 1.60-second 10-yard split, 35.5-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-8 broad jumpGyllenborg ran the 40-yard dash in 4.60 seconds, which is more than respectable for a tight end of his size. He held his own in the sled-blocking drills and was excellent in the gauntlet drill, including making a mid-run adjustment on his second rep.\nMatthew Hibner, SMUMeasurables: 6-foot-4¼, 251 pounds, 9⅜-inch hands, 32⅜-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.57-second 40-yard dash, 1.61-second 10-yard split, 37-inch vertical jump, 9-foot-8 broad jumpHibner had been buried behind several talented tight ends at Michigan but has shown more of his pass-catching ability at SMU. He posted an impressive 37-inch vertical jump and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.57 seconds.\nNate Boerkircher, Texas A&MMeasurables: 6-foot-5½, 245 pounds, 10½-inch hands, 32⅝-inch arm lengthTesting: Did not participate in on-field testingBoerkircher entered the event known primarily as a blocking tight end, a role that has gained increased value in today's NFL through the success of players like Jackson Hawes and others. He did a nice job in the gauntlet drill, drifting slightly but showcasing strong hands while maintaining speed.\n            \n\n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        With only a few days remaining in the regular season for the vast majority of conferences, bubble teams are feeling NCAA Tournament implications in every game.CBS Sports bracketologist Connor Groel considers Texas A&M \"the biggest wild card\" in the field -- which is pretty remarkable considering just two weeks ago the Aggies were 9-11 on the season, just 2-11 in the SEC and had lost six of their last seven games. But on Thursday night, Joni Taylor's squad beat Mississippi State 68-64 for its fourth win in a row, which, according to Groel, boosts them into his Next Four Out. \"Since the tournament became 64 teams, every at-large team has had at least 16 wins and been two or more games above .500,\" Groel said. The Aggies, who played a very sparse nonconference schedule so have fewer games on their resume than most of the field, are currently 13-11. However, they are ranked 40th in WAB, have some quality wins and are peaking at the right time, which will certainly help, especially \"because the committee could reward them for being the hottest bubble team entering the tournament.\"Texas A&M finishes the season against Ole Miss on Sunday, and that victory -- and/or a couple of wins in the SEC tournament -- could help the Aggies get to the Big Dance, a feat that seemed unfathomable mid February. (More on Ole Miss later in the column.)\nAs we've discussed before, the ACC is full of bubble teams. On Tuesday, Virginia was projected as a No. 10 seed by Groel. The Cavaliers fell 82-70 to North Carolina two days later, but a loss to a good team likely didn't affect them too much. That being said, their upcoming game against Virginia Tech shouldn't be taken lightly. As Groel put it, the winner of that game \"should be feeling really good about making the tourney.\" The Clemson Tigers improved their resume with a win over Duke last Sunday. They continued taking care of business in a 70-63 road win against Cal and Groel now considers them safely into the tournament, along with Princeton and Villanova. Clemson will end the regular season against the Stanford Cardinal, a team that has a lot of work to do if it wants to avoid missing the tournament for the second consecutive year.\nColorado was a Last Four In Team on Tuesday, but a loss to Utah later that day means their game at BYU on Saturday is even more important. Arizona State is in a similar position after losing to BYU. The Sun Devils have a tough task ahead as they will close their regular season with a road game against Texas Tech.While we won't get another full Bracketology update until Monday, Groel did provide us with a look at where his bubble stands as of Feb. 27, though he emphasizes that these teams are all extremely close, especially Colorado, South Dakota State and the eight teams on the outside looking in. In other words, every game truly does count right now.Last Four In: Virginia, Virginia Tech, Colorado, South Dakota StateFirst Four Out: Arizona State, Richmond, Mississippi State, StanfordNext Four Out: Kansas, BYU, Utah, Texas A&MElsewhere, the competition heating up for teams hoping for a chance to host an NCAA tournament game. Kentucky has a home game against South Carolina on Sunday, which could help the Wildcats chances at moving up to a No. 4 seed. However, the current No. 4 seeds -- Minnesota, TCU, Michigan State and Maryland -- will also be trying to hang on. \nMichigan State hosting projected No. 3 seed Ohio State on Sunday is one of the must-watch matchups for this weekend, along with Duke at North Carolina (more on that below).Here is what else is happening in women's college basketball:LSU clinches double-byeAn 89-73 win over Tennessee helped the Tigers secure one of the top four spots in the SEC standings, which will give them a free ticket to the quarterfinals of the conference tournament along with South Carolina, Vanderbilt and Texas. That was also the Tigers' 25th win this season, making Kim Mulkey the first coach in SEC history to win 25+ games in each of her first five seasons with a program.\nSo far, the Tigers have been a No. 3 seed in all NCAA Tournament appearances under Mulkey, but this year they could be looking at a No. 2 seed, and technically, a No. 1 seed is not impossible either -- although right now it's more likely the last No. 1 seed goes to Texas or Vanderbilt.\nOle Miss unlikely to hostThe Rebels were one of the early top 16 teams released by the NCAA on Feb. 14. However, a 74-67 loss to Florida on Thursday likely cost Ole Miss a chance at a No. 4 seed, which would have allowed them to host an NCAA Tournament game for the first time since 1992.\"I was just really disappointed in our presence,\" Coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin said postgame. \"I didn't feel like we showed up ready to compete. Right now this is the time of the year when teams should be desperate to win and I just didn't feel that desperation from my team. So that's something that I will have to look at and figure out how to correct.\"\nDawn Staley confirms Chloe Kitts' returnEarlier this week, South Carolina coach Dawn Staley announced that senior Chloe Kitts will return for the 2026-27 season. The 6-foot-2 forward was sidelined after she tore her ACL during a practice on September 2025.The team will also get back senior forward Ashlyn Watkins, who took a year off for personal reasons. The biggest question right now is whether or not Madina Okot will get another year of eligibility because despite being a senior, this is only her second year playing at an NCAA institution. She spent two seasons at Zetech University in Kenya before playing at Mississippi State through the 2024-25 season and then transferring to South Carolina.\"We're trying to get a year back,\" Staley said. \"Whether or not we'll be able to do that and prove that the conditions that she played in her first two years in Kenya were not comparable to NCAA standards.\"\nGame to watch this weekendNo. 12 Duke at No. 21 North Carolina -- Sunday (12 p.m. ET on ESPN)In-state rivalries are always fun, but more so when there are postseason implications on the line. Groel has Duke projected as a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament, but the Tar Heels will need this one if they want a chance at jumping from a No. 5 seed to a No. 4. Duke took a 72-68 home victory on February 15, which was part of a 17-game winning streak that recently got snapped by Clemson. However, now it's the Tar Heels' turn to host. The team is fresh off an 82-70 road win against Virginia in which they registered a program record 16 3-pointers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Diego Pavia is one of the most polarizing prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft. On one hand, the former Vanderbilt star has the production and track record that one would expect of an early-round pick. He never had a losing season as a starting quarterback at the collegiate level and was a 2025 Heisman Trophy finalist after throwing for an SEC-leading 29 touchdowns and rushing for 10 more scores. But Pavia does carry some significant question marks into the draft process. During multiple media availabilities at the NFL Scouting Combine on Friday, Pavia was pelted with questions about his maturity, an issue that often took the spotlight during his time with the Commodores. \"Yeah, [Vanderbilt] coach [Clark] Lea always preached that your frontal lobe isn't fully developed until you're 25,\" Pavia joked when fielding one question about his maturity. \"I just turned 24, so I got like 360 more days to go.\"\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL Draft Big Board: Ranking the top 200 prospects as the NFL combine unfolds\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPavia's humor didn't deflect the deluge. NFL front offices have likely had similar questions to what Pavia has faced in his public appearances. \nHe issued an apology in December after facing backlash after a social media post that stated \"F-all the [Heisman] voters.\" He was also spotted at a club partying with a \"F--- Indiana\" sign in reaction to Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who beat Pavia for the Heisman before leading the Hoosiers to a national title. Pavia defended his reputation in an interview with CBS Sports by arguing that outsiders often confuse his confidence for arrogance. \"I want them to know, and the future teammates that I do have, that, game on the line, I got you. Don't worry about it,\" Pavia said. \"That's how I carry myself. I think people get caught up in my confidence for arrogance. But my confidence comes from my preparation of work that I put in in the offseason, the week of, just things like that. That's what boosts me to have that extra edge on Saturday.\"\nPavia is one of the most experienced quarterbacks in the 2026 draft class, something he can leverage in his interviews with NFL teams. He played two years at New Mexico Military Institute, two at New Mexico State and two at Vanderbilt. In that time, he amassed a 47-22 record while throwing for 12,899 yards and 114 touchdowns with 4,210 yards and 46 touchdowns rushing. \"I've seen a lot of football,\" Pavia said. \"I feel like I can process a defense really fast, get the ball where it needs to go, check us into good plays, stay out of bad plays. I feel like that's how you stay on schedule, that second-and-6, third-and-short, that's how you win football games.\"   \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Charles Bediako's latest attempt to play for Alabama was denied on Friday. The former Crimson Tide center filed an appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court on Monday, two weeks after a Tuscaloosa County circuit court judge denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The appeal was denied on Friday.Bediako sought an interim injunctive relief that would have allowed him to play immediately. Judge Daniel Pruet, who ruled on Bediako's initial injunction request, denied that temporary relief on Tuesday. The next step for Bediako and his representation was to make the same request to the Alabama Supreme Court in search of a different outcome via an emergency motion. It did not come to fruition, likely signaling an end to Bediako's hopes of returning to the floor for the Crimson Tide this season.Bediako has remained a student at Alabama and helped with the scout team, per coach Nate Oats. While waiting for the result of his appeal, Bediako played for Team Canada in Puerto Rico on Thursday as part of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers. Meanwhile, No. 17 Alabama will face No. 22 Tennessee on the road on Saturday as it looks to extend its winning streak to eight games.\"We understand that Charles is pursuing an appeal in his case against the NCAA, and ultimately, he must do what he considers to be in his best interest,\" the University of Alabama said in a statement. \"The University continues to support Charles as he works toward completing his degree.\"\nIt's the latest twist in what's been quite the saga for Bediako, the NCAA and eligibility rules.Bediako played for Alabama in 2021-22 and 2022-23 before forgoing the rest of his eligibility and entering the NBA Draft pool. Though he did not get drafted, he signed a two-way contract with the San Antonio Spurs. He never appeared in an NBA game but did play for the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League. He also appeared in G League games for the Grand Rapids Gold and the Motor City Cruise on Exhibit 10 contracts.\n        \n            \n                Charles Bediako ineligible after judge's ruling: Why 7-footer's journey from G League back to Alabama is over\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn late January 2026, Bediako filed suit against the NCAA, requesting \"immediate preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\" Because Bediako enrolled in Alabama in 2021, he was -- and is still -- within his five-year eligibility clock. Tuscaloosa County judge James Roberts granted Beidako a temporary restraining order against the NCAA, paving the way for him to return to the Crimson Tide. After it was later discovered Roberts is an Alabama donor; he recused himself from the case.\nUnder the order, Bediako played in five games with Alabama from Jan. 24 to Feb. 7, averaging 10 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 blocks while shooting 77%.On Feb. 9, Alabama circuit court judge Daniel Pruet denied Bediako's motion seeking a preliminary injunction against NCAA eligibility rules. The aim of the preliminary injunction had been to allow Bediako to play for the rest of the season.\"Common sense won a round today,\" NCAA president Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"The court saw this for what it is: an attempt by professionals to pivot back to college and crowd out the next generation of students. College sports are for students, not for people who already walked away to go pro and now want to hit the 'undo' button at the expense of a teenager's dream.\n\"While we're glad the court upheld the rules our members actually want, one win doesn't fix the national mess of state laws. It's time for Congress to stop watching from the sidelines and help us provide some actual stability.\"Bediako's return to college basketball after signing multiple NBA contracts had caused significant consternation among NCAA higher-ups, with even SEC commissioner Greg Sankey signing an affidavit against Bediako's cause.\n            ",

It will be the 47th all-time meeting between the Big 12 rivals, with Iowa State holding a 24-22 edge. This is the teams' only regular-season matchup, though they could meet again in next month's Big 12 Tournament.Iowa State is coming off a win over Utah and has won eight of its past 10 games. The Cyclones enter the weekend in a four-way tie for second place in the Big 12 standings along with Houston, Texas Tech and Kansas -- all of which are two games behind Arizona.Texas Tech continues to adjust without star forward JT Toppin, who tore his ACL earlier this month against Arizona State. Toppin was a potential National Player of the Year candidate before the season-ending injury.

The Cyclones are 15-0 at home this season and are the only Big 12 team without a loss on their home floor. Their last home defeat came March 4, 2025, against BYU -- nearly a calendar year ago. Iowa State is 48-2 at home over the past three seasons.Can Texas Tech pull the upset without Toppin? Losing a player of Toppin's caliber lowered Texas Tech's ceiling. Still, the Red Raiders' gritty style makes them a difficult matchup in March. It helps that Christian Anderson has emerged as an All-American-level performer. He will need to carry much of the offensive load down the stretch if Texas Tech hopes to spring the upset.Big 12 title race implications: The winner will remain in contention for a share of the Big 12 regular-season title and gain a valuable boost in conference tournament seeding. At minimum, the winner could position itself for the No. 2 seed. The top four teams in the standings receive a double-bye in the Big 12 Tournament.

I expect Iowa State to win by double digits on Saturday. Pick: Iowa State -7\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            ATS\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Texas Tech\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Texas Tech\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Iowa St.\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        INDIANAPOLIS -- It's Friday of NFL combine week, which means prospect measurements and on-field workouts are officially in full swing. The schedule is as follows:Friday: TE and DBSaturday: QB, RB and WRSunday: OLIn the morning, players log official measurements, including height, weight, wingspan, arm length and hand size. In the afternoon, they participate in on-field testing -- including the 40-yard dash, vertical and broad jumps, and bench press -- before wrapping up with positional drills inside Lucas Oil Stadium.The festivities kicked off Thursday with defensive linemen, edge rushers and linebackers. Much of the day's discussion centered on Rueben Bain Jr.'s historically short arms, but once workouts began, attention shifted to the top prospects not named Bain, who elected not to work out. (Other top prospects to sit out included Peter Woods, Akheem Mesidor and CJ Allen.)Ohio State EDGE Arvell Reese -- the No. 3 prospect in CBS Sports draft analyst Mike Renner's rankings -- performed like a bona fide top-five pick, as did Ohio State LB Sonny Styles (No. 10) and Texas Tech EDGE David Bailey (No. 19).\nNow attention turns to defensive backs and tight ends on Friday. While Tennessee's Jermod McCoy and LSU's Mansoor Delane -- two of Renner's top three cornerbacks in this class -- will not participate, expect other first-round talents like Ohio State's Caleb Downs (No. 7), Clemson's Avieon Terrell (No. 11) and Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq (No. 29) to showcase their unique skill sets.As combine week rolls along, we've got you covered with every official measurement and testing number as they come in from Indianapolis.CB measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanJermod McCoyTennessee6-0 ¾188931 ¼77Avieon TerrellClemson5-10 ¾1868 ⅝3175 ½Mansoor DelaneLSU5-11 ¾1878 ⅞3074 ½Colton HoodTennessee5-11 ⅝193931 ⅜74 ⅞Keith AbneyArizona State5-101879 ⅝30--Chris JohnsonSan Diego State6-01939 ⅞30 ⅝--D'Angelo PondsIndiana5-8 ⅝1829 ⅝29 ⅜72 ¼Keionte ScottMiami (FL)5-11 ¼1939 ⅝31 ⅜76 ⅝Brandon CisseSouth Carolina5-11 ¾1898 ⅝30 ⅝75 ⅞Devin MooreFlorida6-3 ¼1988 ⅝31 ⅝76 ⅞Julian NealArkansas6-22039 ¾32 ⅝--Will Lee IIITexas A&M6-1 ½189932 ⅝--Malik MuhammadTexas6-01829 ⅞32 ⅜--Davison IgbinosunOhio State6-21899 ⅛32 ⅞--Daylen EveretteGeorgia6-11969 ⅝31 ⅞--Chandler RiversDuke5-9 ½1859 ¾29 ⅜--Hezekiah MassesCalifornia6-11798 ¼31 ⅛--TJ HallIowa6-11899 ½30--Domani JacksonAlabama6-11949 ⅛31 ⅛--Tacario DavisWashington6-3 ⅞1949 ¼33 ⅜80 ⅞Thaddeus DixonNorth Carolina6-11951031 ⅛--Ephesians PrysockWashington6-3 ⅜1969 ⅝33 ⅛80 ½Charles DemmingsStephen F.

His play on the field has been fantastic, and that will ultimately determine where teams take him in April. Antoine Winfield Jr. (a second-round pick in 2020) is one player with similar measurements who has gone on to find success. \nPonds also has an acceptable wingspan of 72 ¼ inches, which, as Mike Renner notes, is longer than DT Byron Murphy II, CB Donte Jackson and CB Roger McCreary, and nearly identical to CB Trent McDuffie. None of those players were drafted later than No. 55 overall.CB testing numbersPlayer40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Jermod McCoy---------------Avieon Terrell----3410-3------Mansoor Delane--------------Colton Hood4.441.5840.510-5------Keith Abney--------------Chris Johnson4.401.543810-6------D'Angelo Ponds----43.5--------Keionte Scott--------------Brandon Cisse----4110-11------Devin Moore4.501.56----------Julian Neal4.491.594011-27.134.20--Will Lee III4.521.564211-0------Malik Muhammad4.421.5139--------Davison Igbinosun4.451.583410-0------Daylen Everette4.381.5437.510-4------Chandler Rivers4.401.553910-10------Hezekiah Masses4.461.5731.59-11------TJ Hall4.591.6236--7.194.19--Domani Jackson4.411.58----------Tacario Davis4.411.593710-3------Thaddeus Dixon----39.510-5------Ephesians Prysock4.451.573910-4------Charles Demmings4.411.554211-0------Jaylon Guilbeau--------------Andre Fuller4.491.563510-9--4.28--Jadon Canady--------------Collin Wright----39--------Toriano Pride Jr.4.321.5137.510-87.20----Ahmari Harvey--------------Latrell McCutchin4.431.5838.510-117.004.18--Avery Smith4.541.6138.510-57.034.46--Marcus Allen4.501.643910-3------SAF measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanCaleb DownsOhio State5-11 ⅝2069 ½30 ¼73 ¼Emmanuel McNeil-WarrenToledo6-3 ½2019 ¼32 ⅛78 ¼Dillon ThienemanOregon6-0 ⅛201931 ⅜78 ⅛Genesis SmithArizona6-2 ⅛2028 ⅞32 ½79 ¼A.J.

He reminded everyone of his NFL potential with a strong showing at the Senior Bowl, then followed that up with impressive combine measurables, including an 85¾-inch wingspan — the longest among combine defensive tackles since 1999. He also posted 98th percentile height (6-foot-6 ¼), 89th percentile weight (327 pounds), 94th percentile hand size (10⅞ inches) and 94th percentile arm length (35 inches). Banks has a good chance to go in the back half of Round 1.\nClemson's Peter Woods entered the 2025 season as a potential top-five pick, but an inconsistent fall -- despite earning first-team All-ACC honors -- pushed him out of that conversation. While Woods remains a first-round talent, some of his measurables disappointed, including fourth-percentile arm length (31¼ inches) and 10th-percentile wingspan (76⅜ inches). Woods also did not participate in on-field drills at the combine. He'll look to show off his skill set at Clemson's pro day on March 12.\nDL testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Peter WoodsClemson--------------Lee HunterTexas Tech5.181.7921.58-4------Kayden McDonaldOhio State--------------Keldric FaulkAuburn359-9------Christen MillerGeorgia--------------Caleb BanksFlorida5.051.76329-6------Jaishawn BarhamMichigan4.641.613310-3------Chris McClellanMissouri5.051.8029.59-0----25Rayshaun BennyMichigan--------------Domonique OrangeIowa State--------------Dontay CorleoneCincinnati--------------Nick BarrettSouth Carolina5.101.7031.59-08.174.91--Darrell Jackson Jr.Florida State--------------LT OvertonAlabama4.871.70----------Kaleb ProctorSE Louisiana4.791.69339-5--4.71--Tim KeenanAlabama5.311.84308-4----21Zxavian HarrisOle Miss--------------Skyler Gill-HowardTexas Tech------------27Gracen HaltonOklahoma4.821.7036.59-68.094.79--DeMonte CapehartClemson4.851.7233.58-11------Albert RegisTexas A&M4.881.72349-87.774.85--Tyler OnyedimTexas A&M----329-3------Bryson EasonTennessee5.091.7830.59-4--5.00--Brandon ClevelandNC State5.121.78----------David GustaKentucky4.881.6832------37Zane DurantPenn State4.751.6633.59-4------Damonic WilliamsOklahoma------------30Gary Smith IIIUCLA----28--------Cameron BallArkansas5.131.79329-18.024.76--Bobby Jamison-TravisAuburn--------------Deven EasternMinnesota----27.59-48.07----Jackie MarshallBaylor4.881.69------4.68--\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top DL/EDGE prospects, plus other standouts from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLB measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanSonny StylesOhio State6-52441032⅞80⅞Anthony HillTexas6-22389⅝32⅜79Jake GoldayCincinnati6-4 ½2399½31⅞76⅞Josiah TrotterMissouri6-223710¼32¼--CJ AllenGeorgia6-0 ¾23010⅛31½75½Kyle LouisPittsburgh6-02209½31¼--Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech6-12319¼30⅞--Lander BartonUtah6-52339½32¼--Harold Perkins Jr.LSU6-12238⅛31⅜--Red MurdockBuffalo6-223210⅜31--Keyshaun ElliottArizona State6-22319¼31¼--Deontae LawsonAlabama6-32269¼31⅞--Bryce BoettcherOregon6-1233930⅝--Taurean YorkTexas A&M5-112268⅜30--Jimmy RolderMichigan6-2 ½2389⅝30½--Aiden FisherIndiana6-12329½31⅛--Wade WoodazClemson6-32361032⅝--Jack KellyBYU6-22409⅛31⅛--Kaleb Elarms-OrrTCU6-2234931½--Scooby WilliamsTexas A&M6-22319¼32--Justin JeffersonAlabama6-02231031⅝--Xavian SoreyArkansas6-22289⅝31⅝--Namdi ObiazorTCU6-322910½30⅝--Owen HeineckeOklahoma6-1 ½2279⅝30⅛--Kendal DanielsOklahoma6-52429½32⅝--Eric GentryUSC6-722110½35--Karson ShararIowa6-1 ⅝23110⅛31⅛--Wesley BissaintheMiami6-22259⅝31⅞--LB testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Sonny StylesOhio State4.461.5643.511-27.094.26--Anthony HillTexas4.511.583710-5----21Jake GoldayCincinnati4.621.603910-57.024.34--Josiah TrotterMissouri------------27CJ AllenGeorgia--------------Kyle LouisPittsburgh4.531.5839.510-96.974.26--Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech4.571.6038.510-16.904.19--Lander BartonUtah--------------Harold Perkins Jr.LSU--------------Red MurdockBuffalo--------------Keyshaun ElliottArizona State----3810-5----21Deontae LawsonAlabama--------------Bryce BoettcherOregon--------------Taurean YorkTexas A&M--------7.324.4825Jimmy RolderMichigan----369-117.004.26--Aiden FisherIndiana--------------Wade WoodazClemson--------------Jack KellyBYU4.571.613710-57.124.19--Kaleb Elarms-OrrTCU4.471.594010-4--4.41--Scooby WilliamsTexas A&M--------------Justin JeffersonAlabama4.571.6038.510-5------Xavian SoreyArkansas4.631.6637.5107.004.42--Namdi ObiazorTCU4.531.56379-117.244.36--Owen HeineckeOklahoma4.621.6234.59-117.15----Kendal DanielsOklahoma--------------Eric GentryUSC--------------Karson ShararIowa4.561.594010-3------Wesley BissaintheMiami--------------\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top LB prospects, plus other standouts from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSaturday: QB, RB and WR measurements and testing numbersResults will be added here as testing begins.Sunday: OL measurements and testing numbersResults will be added here as testing begins.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 23 Miami (Ohio) was tested on Friday night at Western Michigan before improving to 29-0 with an uncomfortably tight 69-67 victory. Trey Perry played the role of hero with a game-winning layup in the final seconds.  With star wing Peter Suder fouled out and starting point guard Luke Skaljac unavailable due to injury, the RedHawks had to fight back in the second half with unorthodox lineups. Perry finished with 14 points, and Almer Atlas added 16, including a 4-point play with 3:26 remaining that drew Miami within one. The win brought Miami within two victories of becoming the first Division I men's college basketball team to finish the regular season undefeated since Gonzaga went 24-0 during the COVID-impacted 2020-21 season. By contrast, Miami's regular-season slate features 31 games. While the RedHawks' schedule has been one of the easiest in college basketball, starting 28-0 is nonetheless a remarkable achievement. It's also a reflection of the program's steady rise under fourth-year coach Travis Steele. \n        \n            \n                Miami (Ohio) reaches 29-0 on last-second shot as Redhawks survive scare at Western Michigan\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAfter finishing 12-20 and 6-12 in the MAC in 2022-23 during Steele's first season, the RedHawks have steadily improved in every season since. A year ago, they finished 25-9 and 14-4 in the MAC, suffering a devastating loss to Akron in the MAC Tournament title game. Steele managed to retain a significant chunk of last season's roster, which makes Miami a rarity in the mid-major ranks.   \nWith continuity and experience in place, the RedHawks have navigated every challenge thus far. However, due to their poor schedule strength — the RedHawks haven't even played a Quad 1 game — their status in the NCAA Tournament field will be up for debate if they fail to win the MAC Tournament.  Though Miami has played zero Quad 1 games and is just 1-0 in Quad 2, there is a metric on official NCAA team sheets that acknowledges the brilliance of its undefeated start.  It's called Wins Against Bubble (WAB), and it calculates how the average bubble team would perform against your schedule. With a WAB score of 2.13 as of Feb. 27, the RedHawks rank 32nd in WAB and are recognized for having over two more victories than the average bubble team would against their slate.  \n  Up next for Miami  The remaining schedule for Miami which is trying to become the first team since Indiana accomplished the feat in the 1975-76 season.  Tuesdayvs. Toledo7 p.m. ESPN+March 6at Ohio7 p.m. CBS Sports NetworkMarch 12-14MAC Tournament (Cleveland)TBD  If Miami doesn't win the MAC Tournament and needs an at-large ticket to the Big Dance, WAB will be one of its best friends. Its current ranking is within at-large territory. Where it gets tricky is that any loss against MAC opposition carries a significant WAB penalty.  Here are all the Selection Sunday scenarios for Miami as it heads down this the stretch with its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2007 in sight.  \n  NCAA Tournament selection scenarios for Miami     The simple scenario (win MAC Tournament)   Record: Between 32-2 and 34-0   Confidence level: It's a party  Likely WAB range: Doesn't matter  Bust out the balloons and hire a caterer for the watch party. Miami can go 2-0 to close the regular season, 0-2 or something in between. It doesn't matter, so long as the RedHawks are cutting down the nets inside Cleveland's Rocket Arena at the end of the MAC Tournament on March 14.   Winning the MAC Tournament is the only 100% guaranteed path to the Big Dance, and it won't be easy. The MAC isn't one of the handful of conferences now offering automatic byes to the semifinals for its top two seeds. The RedHawks will have to win three games in three days against a field consisting exclusively of the league's top eight teams.  \nMany of the players on this Miami team were part of a gutting 76-74 loss to Akron in last year's MAC Tournament title game in which the Zips rallied late to stun the RedHawks. That should only provide more motivation as Miami seeks its first conference tournament title since 2007.    The MAC Madness scenario  Selection Sunday record: 31-1, 32-1 or 33-1  Confidence level: Feeling optimistic  Likely WAB range: 37-43  Miami could still feel reasonably hopeful about making the Big Dance if it entered the MAC Tournament 31-0 and then dropped a game. While on some level it could matter who the loss came against, the RedHawks would still enter Selection Sunday with a WAB ranking in the at-large realm, regardless of who was responsible for handing them their first defeat.  \nA loss on a neutral floor in the MAC Tournament would likely come with a WAB cost of around 0.80. If Miami lost 0.80 in WAB today, it would drop the RedHawks  from the low-to-mid 30s in the metric to around 40th. The team with the best WAB ranking left out of last year's field was West Virginia, which arrived at Selection Sunday at No. 43 in the WAB. The 2025 selection process was the first to utilize WAB, so there isn't a trove of past precedents to rely upon. But WVU's exclusion last year sets a benchmark for Miami to aim for: don't fall to No. 43.  Finishing the regular season undefeated and then losing in the MAC Tournament would likely be good enough to keep the RedHawks below that figure, which would be enough for them to enter Selection Sunday with some cautious optimism.  \n  Double-defeat scenario  Selection Sunday record: 30-2, 31-2 or 32-2  Confidence level: Feeling nervous  Likely WAB range: 43-52  The double-defeat scenario involves Miami losing one regular-season game, in addition to a MAC Tournament game.   This would not be advisable, as it would likely lead to Miami's Selection Sunday WAB ranking landing in the mid-40s, at best. However, in this scenario, the opponent for the conference tournament loss could make a difference. If it's a high-end Quad 2 loss against Akron in the title game, then it would be less costly.  \nThe team with the worst WAB ranking selected to last year's field was Xavier, which was among the Last Four In at No. 49 in WAB. However, the Musketeers counterbalanced their lagging resume metrics with a predictive metrics profile hovering around 40th nationally.   Miami University does not have good predictive metrics to fall back upon. So slipping out of the low-to-mid 40s in WAB would make things dicey. If Miami loses twice, a slip of that magnitude is likely, and it would make Selection Sunday uncomfortable.    Three-loss scenario  Selection Sunday record: 29-3, 30-3, 31-3  Confidence level: Better brace for disappointment  Likely WAB range: 50-60  \nAn 0-2 finish to the regular season, combined with a loss in the MAC Tournament, would decimate Miami's at-large chances. In this scenario, the best conceivable outcome would be that the RedHawks  lose in the MAC Tournament title game against Akron in a heartbreaking way that tugs on the heartstrings of committee members. But it would be a tough case to make.   With three losses on its ledger, Miami would almost certainly lag behind other bubble teams in resume metrics. Remember, it's not just about win-loss record. It's about the totality of your resume. WAB does a good job of quantifying that, and it wouldn't be on Miami's side if the RedHawks  lost three times.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nFlash back to Jan. 10, 2019. Brad Underwood was in just his second season as coach of the Fighting Illini. John Beilein was in his final season as coach of the Wolverines, and Illinois and Michigan were led in scoring by — wait for it — Ignas Brazdeikis and Trent Frazier, respectively.The second-ranked Wolverines beat the Illini, 79-69, that night in Champaign, Ill. That is noteworthy because that is the last time Michigan has beaten Illinois in men's basketball.The Illinois Fighting Illini have won nine in a row against the Michigan Wolverines, and it is with that backdrop that No. 3 Michigan and No. 10 Illinois meet tonight at the State Farm Center in Champaign. If the Wolverines (26-2, 16-1 in Big Ten) can stop the nine-game losing streak, they would clinch the outright conference regular season title. They are coming off a 77-67 victory over Minnesota on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Illini (22-6, 13-4) are looking to bounce back from a 95-94 overtime loss at UCLA on Saturday. The team sits in a three-way tie for second in the Big Ten, with Michigan State and Nebraska. Michigan is a slight 1.5-point favorite over Illinois on Friday.While Wolverines vs. Illini is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes five NBA games and a partial college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Feb. 27. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 3 Michigan at No. 10 IllinoisTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Champaign, Ill. | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Illinois +1.5 | Expert: Illinois -105 (Chip Patterson)\nAs Duke showed last weekend, the Wolverines are not unbeatable. The Blue Devils knocked off then No. 1-ranked Michigan by controlling the boards and preventing second shots, outrebounding the Wolverines 41-28. That bodes well for Illinois, which ranks sixth in the country in rebound margin (10.6 rebounds per game). The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times, says the Illini have a 75.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Illinois +1.5. Meanwhile Patterson notes that Illinois hasn't had a game since blowing a 23-point lead in an overtime loss at UCLA last Saturday. \"So while Michigan had a bit of a palate-cleanser from the Duke game with its win against Minnesota at home, I think the Illini are going to be breathing fire,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchCavaliers at PistonsTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Detroit | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Detroit -5.5\nTwo Eastern Conference contenders collide when the Detroit Pistons and Cleveland Cavaliers battle at Little Caesars Arena. The Pistons (43-14) lead the East by 5.5 games over the Celtics, while the Cavaliers (37-23) sit in fourth. But Cleveland is actually the +280 betting favorite at DraftKings to win the conference, ahead of Boston (+310) and Detroit (+360). On Friday, however, the Cavaliers will be without All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell, who has a right groin strain. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Pistons have a 52.0% chance to cover and gives a C grade to Detroit -5.5.Nuggets at ThunderTime: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Nuggets +8 | Expert: Nikola Jokic Under 52.5 Points + Assists + Rebounds -121 (Matt Severance)\nWhom do you have for NBA MVP? Shai Gilgeous-Alexander or Nikola Jokic? Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning MVP, is the -250 favorite at DraftKings, while three-time MVP Jokic is the +425 second choice. On Friday they will go head-to-head when Gilgeous-Alexander and the Oklahoma City Thunder host Jokic and the Denver Nuggets. The game will be the first since Feb. 3 for Gilgeous-Alexander, who has missed the last nine games with an abdominal strain. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Nuggets have a 51.0% chance to cover and assigns a C grade to Denver +8. Meanwhile, Severance notes that Jokic had \"just\" 31 total points, rebounds and assists in his lone game against Oklahoma City this season. \"Jokic could go 30/10/10 and we still win fairly easily,\" he says.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 14 Kansas at No. 2 ArizonaTime: 4 p.m. Saturday | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Arizona -8.5\nThe first meeting this season between these two teams was one of college basketball's games of the year. In a raucous environment at Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks gave the No. 1 Wildcats their first loss of the season, 82-78. Kansas pulled the upset despite playing without presumptive No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson, whose mysterious absences from games this season have been well documented. He, however, has finished back-to-back games now for the Jayhawks (21-7, 11-4 in Big 12). Speaking of absences, Arizona stud freshman Koa Peat is getting closer to a return and could be back in the lineup on Saturday for the Wildcats (26-2, 13-2). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 55.0% chance Arizona covers and gives a C grade to Wildcats -8.5.No. 20 Arkansas at No. 7 FloridaTime: 8:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Arkansas +9.5 | Expert: Over 166.5 (Thomas Casale)\nTwo of the top teams in the SEC collide when the Florida Gators host the Arkansas Razorbacks at the O'Connell Center. The Gators (22-6, 13-2 in SEC) lead the conference by two games over the Razorbacks (21-7, 11-4) and Alabama, and they can clinch the outright regular season title with a win and a Crimson Tide loss at Tennessee on Saturday. But Arkansas has one of the most efficient offenses in the country. Led by freshman Darius Acuff, the Razorbacks average 128.6 points per 100 possessions according to KenPom, which ranks fourth in the nation. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 52.0% chance Arkansas covers and assigns a C grade to Razorbacks +9.5. Meanwhile, Casale likes that Arkansas plays at a fast tempo (28th in the country). \"The Gators averaged 92 points in wins over Georgia, Vanderbilt, Alabama and Texas A&M — all teams that rank top 80 in tempo,\" he says.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        George Pickens had a career season in his first year in Dallas in 2025. Now, we could get a repeat performance in 2026 after the Cowboys placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Pickens on Friday.Under the non-exclusive franchise tag, Pickens can negotiate with other teams, but Dallas has the right to match any offer. And both sides will still have until mid-July to negotiate a potential multi-year deal, which is something the Cowboys have expressed interest in doing. If no long-term extension is finalized, Pickens will play out the 2026 campaign on a one-year, $28.8 million contract, which is fully guaranteed.We hope this contract situation doesn't get messy and cause Pickens to miss any time in training camp. If he remains with the Cowboys as expected then he has the chance to be a low-end No. 1 Fantasy receiver in all leagues, and he will be worth drafting as early as Round 3.Pickens came to Dallas prior to last season in a trade from Pittsburgh, and it was a fantastic deal for the Cowboys. He had career highs in catches (93), yards (1,429), touchdowns (nine) and targets (137), and he played all 17 games. He averaged a career-best 17.2 PPR points per game, which was No. 6 behind Puka Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Ja'Marr Chase, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Rashee Rice.\nPickens had five games with more than 100 yards receiving, and he set a franchise record with five games of at least 130 yards receiving and a touchdown. According to ESPN, his 13 catches of at least 25 yards and 73 first-down receptions ranked in the top five in the NFL.Now, while Pickens was great all season, he was a dominant force when CeeDee Lamb missed three games and the majority of another from Weeks 3-6 with an ankle injury. Pickens scored at least 17.8 PPR points in three of those four games and averaged 24.2 PPR points over that span, with five touchdowns.Pickens staying in Dallas isn't great news for Lamb, who had a down year in 2025. He finished the season with 75 catches for 1,077 yards and three touchdowns on 117 targets in 14 games, and he averaged just 14.4 PPR points per game. It was his lowest reception and yardage total since his rookie season in 2020, and this was the worst touchdown total of his career.\nWe're counting on Lamb to bounce back in 2026, even with Pickens on the roster, and he should be drafted no later than Round 2 in the majority of leagues. But Lamb is no longer in the same tier as Nacua, Smith-Njigba, Chase and St. Brown, and you shouldn't reach for Lamb on Draft Day.Pickens' return is great news for Dak Prescott, who passed for 4,552 yards, 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions in 2025, along with 177 rushing yards and two touchdowns. He averaged 21.9 Fantasy points per game, which was No. 7 among quarterbacks behind Matthew Stafford, Josh Allen, Drake Maye, Brock Purdy, Patrick Mahomes and Trevor Lawrence.This was the third time in Prescott's career that he passed for at least 4,500 yards and fourth time with at least 30 touchdowns. With his elite duo of receivers back, Prescott is worth drafting as a No. 1 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues with a mid-round pick.\nThe Cowboys have been aggressive so far this offseason by using the franchise tag on Pickens and signing Javonte Williams to a contract extension. Dallas should once again be a standout offense, and we like that as Fantasy managers.We'll continue to monitor the situation for Pickens and if he'll get a long-term contract. As long as he doesn't hold out in training camp, Pickens has the chance to once again be an awesome Fantasy receiver in 2026.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Professional wrestling is obsessed with singular achievements, especially during WrestleMania season. Superstars chase their \"WrestleMania moment\" and strive to \"finish the story.\" Finn Balor doesn't see it that way. For him, every accomplishment is a thread in a much grander body of work.  This year marks 25 years since Balor's wrestling debut. He may not look it, but he's long in the tooth. The milestone hit harder when his longtime friend and colleague AJ Styles retired ahead of his WWE Hall of Fame induction.\"Seeing AJ retire got me thinking about a lot of things,\" Balor told CBS Sports before Saturday's WWE Elimination Chamber. \"I've always  looked up to AJ. I've always chased his coattails, so to speak. He's  always been the benchmark for what we all strive to be. Seeing him  retire brought it home to me that my days are numbered. AJ has been an  ever-present for me for the last 25 years.\"  Balor will challenge world heavyweight champion CM Punk at Elimination Chamber. The title isn't the only thing at stake. The winner will defend it against Roman Reigns in the main event of WrestleMania 42. Balor is one pinfall away from righting a wrong and securing what many consider the biggest match of his career.  \n\"I have this massive stain on my career from 10 years ago when I got hurt and had to relinquish the universal championship,\" Balor said. \"I've been asked about that in every interview for 10 years. This whole 'what if.'\"Balor couldn't have scripted a better main roster start. In 2016, he defeated Roman Reigns, Kevin Owens and two others in the same night to earn a universal championship match. He became the first person to win a WWE world title in his debut pay-per-view match by dethroning Seth Rollins at SummerSlam. He also suffered a torn labrum that night. His first and only WWE world title reign lasted 22 hours.For 10 years, Balor has revisited that moment in nearly every interview. People remain fixated on what could have been. Since vacating the universal championship, he's won multiple intercontinental and tag team titles, reclaimed the NXT championship and captured the United States title. None of it has erased the stain of that lone world title run.  \n\"It's not like I haven't been trying, but for some reason, people can't  get these 'what ifs' out of their heads,\" Balor said. \"The only way  to fix that is by becoming world champion again.\"  \nBalor might not live in the main event, but he's a constant presence on television. That consistency isn't complacency. It's the product of a drive that's endured for 25 years, regardless of where he's slotted on the card. Headlining Elimination Chamber, and potentially WrestleMania, matters. It just isn't new fuel.\"You can't define your legacy over one match in Belfast, or one moment in Barclays Center, where I got hurt. It's  based on a 25-year career,\" Balor explained. \"It's a body of work that I'm trying to  present. If you look at my body of work, I think it's pretty  accomplished. Sure, I haven't won the world title in 10 years. How many  people have won the Best of the Super Juniors? How many have dominated  in Japan, been successful in Mexico, Europe, and WWE for 10 years?\n\"I try not to worry too much about  feelings in the moment. I try to zoom out and look at the 25 years. Am I  happy with the 25 years? Yes. Has being in the main event reignited a  spark that may have extinguished? No, because the spark never  extinguished. I've always had this burning desire to perform. If that's  in the first match or the last match, once I'm performing, that's what's  important.\"Elimination Chamber isn't about retribution. It's another entry into a rich codex.\"Am I happy with my career?\" Balor asked. \"I would have been happy having one match. My goal when I started training was to have one match. Everything after that was a bonus. Coming to WWE was the most far-fetched idea for a small kid from Ireland. There were no wrestling schools. There was no industry. Nothing.\"\n            ",

New Mexico, led by Eric Olen, gets its revenge after dropping the first meeting by four points in January. Pick: New Mexico -3 (Kyle Boone)\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            NM -3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            San Diego St.\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            New Mexico\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years. \n            ",

All three are Tier 1 talents who could be No. 1 pick candidates in any year. And all three have viable cases to go No. 1 this year. My personal preference (in a vacuum, of course) would be Boozer: a four-time high school state champion, three-time Peach Jam winner and two-time gold medalist. He leads Duke in scoring, assists, rebounds and minutes, and the Blue Devils are 26-2 and on trajectory to be a No. 1 seed with him as its leader. He's a winner. There is no consensus of course, yet, on who will go No. 1 this summer. But most believe it will be Dybantsa, the BYU wing, or Peterson, the Kansas guard. So to fit the specs for a mock draft -- projecting how I think NBA teams, not myself, would pick players -- I have Dybantsa going No. 1 overall in my mock. He leads the nation in scoring (25.1 PPG), has grown as a playmaker, and, for good measure, has the frame and athletic profile that just looks like a future NBA star.  Boozer in this mock goes second and Peterson slips to No. 3. It's entirely possible that order on draft night is flipped.  \nFor this mock, I considered team need for every pick -- though I took into account areas in the draft where tiers of talent drop off. For example, the Jazz pick at No. 6 and would do well to land a player like Boozer or Caleb Wilson. But with both off the board and point guard the clear best available talents, I have them selecting point guard Kingston Flemings. In a rebuild, sometimes the best decision is taking the best prospect even if it overlaps with what may be on the roster. \n        \n            \n                College Basketball Power Rankings: Which teams are most likely to win the NCAA Tournament title in 2026?\n                \n                    Kyle Boone                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMock DraftRound 1\n            \n\n\n        \n                        ",

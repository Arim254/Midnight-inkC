    "body": "\n        The Thanksgiving NFL games are amongst the most watched on a yearly basis, and that should certainly be the case with the middle matchup of Thursday's slate. It has Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys hosting Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs. Dallas (5-5-1) is coming off 24-21 comeback victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, and the Cowboys are 34-22-1 all-time on Thanksgiving.

RB Isiah Pacheco (knee) will return for Kansas City, while Cowboys OL Tyler Guyton (ankle) is out.Kickoff is from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, at 4:30 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+.

Get 2 months at $2.99/monthWhy the Chiefs can coverThe Chiefs are coming off a win over the previously 8-2 Colts, despite Mahomes not throwing a touchdown, which shows that the team can win in multiple ways. Kareem Hunt ran for over 100 yards versus what was the No. 5 run defense, while Indy's Jonathan Taylor -- who leads the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns -- was held to just 58 yards on the ground and kept out of the endzone. As for Mahomes, the native Texan should relish his first pro game in Dallas as he gets to face the Cowboys' No. 30 pass defense as the Chiefs look to improve to 4-1 ATS versus NFC opponents this year. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Cowboys can coverIt's been over 50 years since the Chiefs won in Dallas, as the Cowboys have prevailed in their last five home games versus Kansas City. Additionally, the Cowboys have won three straight Thanksgiving Day games, with a 16.7-point average margin of victory in them. Despite Andy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce being on the other sideline, it's the Cowboys who will have the best offense on the field as they rank first in yards and fourth in scoring. Additionally, the Cowboys should be able to take advantage of a team which has gotten a little sloppy as of late as the Chiefs have as many turnovers (six) over their last four games as they had over their previous 18 regular season games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Cowboys vs. Chiefs picksFor the NFL Week 13 game of Chiefs vs. Cowboys, the model is leaning Under the total.

From Ohio State vs. Michigan (+9.5) to Alabama vs. Auburn (+5.5) to Virginia vs. Virginia Tech (+9.5), many may place Week 14 college football bets with their hearts as much as their heads. Not only can you make picks on those conference matchups, but a number of non-conference contests could factor into your college football betting strategy. South Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite over Clemson, per the latest Week 14 college football odds, in an SEC vs. ACC battle.Others of that ilk include Florida vs. Florida State (+1.5) and Kentucky vs. Louisville (-3). Meanwhile, no team has performed better in college football picks against the spread than Texas Tech, which is 10-1 versus the line. The Red Raiders are 23.5-point favorites over West Virginia as the former seeks a win to secure its first-ever trip to the Big 12 Championship Game.

The Gators have been much more competitive since firing Billy Napier as the team has as many ATS wins (two) in four games under interim Billy Gonzales as it had in seven games under Napier. Florida won last year's matchup -- by 20 points on the road -- and it hosting this year's contest gives it a massive advantage. The Seminoles have not won or covered in an away stadium since 2023 as they are 0-8 both straight-up and against the spread over that run. In addition to Florida covering, the model forecasts the Under to hit in over 60% of simulations. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: Virginia Tech (+9.5, 52.5) covers on the road versus No. 17 Virginia at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday. It's impossible to ignore the outright dominance of the Hokies over their in-state rival in this series, as Virginia Tech has won 19 of its last 20 games versus Virginia Tech. The last few matchups haven't even been close, as Virginia Tech won by 20 points at home last year and prevailed by 38 points the last time UVA hosted in 2023. This year, the Hokies have played much better under interim coach, Philip Montgomery, as they've both outright won and covered three times under him, compared to being winless both straight up and ATS under former coach Brent Fry. UVA has dropped two straight at home ATS as the model forecasts this as a one-score game. The model projects the Hokies to cover well over 50% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 14The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 14, and it's identified several A-rated picks involving major games. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which A-rated picks should you jump on?

On Thursday, the New York Giants announced that their rookie quarterback had officially cleared the concussion protocol, meaning he could be back in the starting lineup when the Giants take on the New England Patriots in Foxborough, Massachusetts, this week on \"Monday Night Football.\" Dart has missed the last two games with a concussion he suffered against the Chicago Bears in Week 10, which was Brian Daboll's final contest as the Giants coach. Interim coach Mike Kafka made the decision to start Jameis Winston in Dart's place, and while the former No. 1 overall pick did bring a spark to New York's offense, he couldn't bring any wins. The 2-10 Giants have lost six straight games, and became the first team to be officially eliminated from playoff contention last week. Dart is 2-5 as the starter this season, and has completed 62.7% of his passes for 1,417 yards, 10 touchdowns and three interceptions in nine total games played. The first-round pick out of Ole Miss has made a major impact with his legs, rushing 57 times for 317 yards and seven touchdowns. Dart has rushed for a touchdown in five consecutive games, which is the longest streak by any rookie quarterback since 1970. \nThe Giants are still searching for their first road win this year. New York is 0-7 away from MetLife Stadium this season despite holding double-digit leads in five of those seven games.  \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 South Carolina and No. 4 Texas are facing off in the inaugural women's basketball Players Era championship game on Thursday. The game is a rematch from the 2025 Final Four. Later on Thanksgiving, No. 3 UCLA and Duke will battle it out in the third-place game.Texas earned its spot with a 76-65 win against UCLA on Wednesday. The Longhorns were missing Aaliyah Crump and Bryanna Preston due to injury, but they still got their biggest win of the season so far. Their defense was visibly disrupting for the Bruins, who ended the night with 20 turnovers. Rori Harmon led Texas' offense with 26 points, and her overall performance led coach Vic Schaefer to say this game showed why she is \"the best point guard in the country.\"\nSouth Carolina picked up a 83-66 win against Duke, a team that is currently out of the AP Top 25 but was ranked in the top 10 during preseason. The Blue Devils kept it close early in the game, but South Carolina got the job done with Joyce Edwards and Madina Okot scoring a combined 45 points. Okot also completed a double-double with 13 rebounds. Just like in the men's tournament, which expanded to 18 teams this year, each participating is set to receive $1 million in NIL money. The players get all the money, which means each of them will receive around $75,000. Other than the money, the elite lineup is a great opportunity for the teams to test themselves against top competition early in the season. Founders of the event also believe this is an opportunity to get a brighter spotlight on college basketball during the fall.\n\"College basketball has always started in November. But let's give it more,\" Players Era co-founder Seth Berger told CBS Sports. \"Let's give everyone a reason to watch, not just the most hardcore of the fans. So first and foremost, I thought there was an opportunity to create a great American sporting event, a tentpole event in November.\" Women's Player Era schedule, scoresAll times are Eastern\nWednesday, Nov. 26No. 4 Texas 76, No. 3 UCLA 65No. 2 South Carolina 83, Duke 66Thursday, Nov. 27No. 2 South Carolina vs. No. 4 Texas (Championship game) | 8 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxDuke vs. No. 3 UCLA (Third-place game) | 10:30 p.m. | TruTV/HBO MaxTexas vs. South Carolina predictionThese are two teams that pride themselves on defense, so I think this game will come down to who can find, and keep, momentum on offense. While both programs worked on getting stronger in this area during the summer and added valuable weapons, Texas probably had the most dramatic improvement since their Final Four meeting (a 17-point South Carolina win). The Longhorns made six 3-pointers against UCLA, which is not a particularly high number, but they did it without Aaliyah Crump and this was also not at all their forte last season. I like the overall potential we are seeing from Texas, especially with how quickly they adjusted with injuries ahead of this tournament. Although this is not an easy decision because South Carolina is always a dangerous opponent, the Longhorns already made a statement in Las Vegas with how they handled a very good UCLA team. Pick: Texas\n            ",

The Lions are already without tight end Sam LaPorta today, who was placed on injured reserve earlier this month with a back injury, and wide receiver Kalif Raymond, who is inactive with an ankle injury. \nDan Campbell will call upon Jameson Williams, Tom Kennedy, plus the rookies Isaac TeSlaa and Dominic Lovett, to potentially step up in St. Brown's absence. \n            \n    ",

Now, in Week 13, those hopes are set to be realized, with the star quarterback expected to make his anticipated return against the rival Baltimore Ravens.In theory, Burrow's return couldn't come at a more perfect time. The Bengals are undeniably desperate, looking to avoid their fifth straight loss after dropping eight of nine contests since Burrow's exit, and yet the AFC North race is far from over. The Ravens are technically on top at 6-5, but their own signal-caller, Lamar Jackson, hardly looks himself. And the division's second-place squad, the Pittsburgh Steelers, are no firmer thanks to a streaky defense and banged-up Aaron Rodgers.Yet if the Bengals couldn't even win while Burrow's emergency fill-in, Joe Flacco, enjoyed big-play production earlier this year, should we really expect a different outcome for Cincinnati on Thursday night? Either way, the third and final matchup of this year's 2025 Thanksgiving slate is must-see material.Bet Ravens vs. Bengals at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Here's everything you need to know to catch Bengals-Ravens on Turkey Day, including key matchups and our prediction:\nWhere to watch Ravens vs. Bengals liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 27 | Time: 8:20 p.m. ETLocation: M&T Bank Stadium (Baltimore)TV: NBCFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Ravens -7, O/U 51.5 (via DraftKings Sportsbook)Key questions\n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            How ready is Joe Burrow, really? Coach Zac Taylor insists his quarterback is \"in good shape\" after a nine-game absence. It helps Burrow also got some practice reps in ahead of the Bengals' last game. Still, the Pro Bowler is returning earlier than initially expected from a severe turf toe injury, and we just saw in San Francisco, with Brock Purdy, what can happen when recovery timelines are rushed. Up against an improved Ravens defense on a short week, this profiles as a tall task for No. 9.Can the Bengals slow Derrick Henry? The Ravens' star running back has been much more erratic this year than last, but he's helped carry Baltimore's grind-it-out attack since Lamar Jackson's return from injury, including with three touchdowns over the last two weeks. After mustering just 3 yards per carry against the New York Jets, this could be just the matchup for him to find daylight, as the Bengals are surrendering 156 rushing yards per game, which is ranked 31st in the entire NFL.Can Ja'Marr Chase single-handedly outrace Baltimore's secondary? The Ravens were surprisingly docile on defense to open the year, but they've tightened up since mid-October, allowing 17 or more points just once during their five-game win streak. Chase is arguably the NFL's top playmaker out wide, especially when Burrow is feeding him downfield opportunities, but he's coming off a one-game suspension and will be without top running mate Tee Higgins, who's sidelined with a concussion.You can bet Ravens vs. Bengals at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:X factor to watch\nOnce a ball-hawking member of the Ravens' secondary, Stone is coming off his splashiest outing of the 2025 campaign in Cincinnati, logging a pick six against Drake Maye and the New England Patriots to help the Bengals flirt with an upset. Practicing against Lamar Jackson and Co. for his first four NFL seasons might give Stone at least some advantage going into this matchup. But Jackson's recent inefficiencies as a passer might be the best thing working in Stone's favor; let's say Lamar gets a little too impatient while seeking the big play for Baltimore, giving his old friend a chance to steal a possession for the Bengals.Prediction\nIt's true that even when Flacco was dealing as Burrow's replacement, the Bengals failed miserably in other facets, be it situational coaching or general defensive competence. But there might be something to the notion that Burrow's return will put a little extra pep in everyone's step. The Ravens' own scattershot offense is another reason to believe this could be a pristine night for Burrow and Chase to reestablish their home run connection and throw another wrench into an already messy AFC North tangle.That said, we hesitate to put too much trust into a Zac Taylor-led operation that's routinely struggled to look prepared, and Higgins' absence should allow Baltimore to really hone in on lessening Chase's impact. There's also the distinct possibility of Jackson rediscovering his own juice as a rusher, with the bruising Henry by his side, against such a porous run \"D\" in Cincy. We anticipate some holiday fireworks before the buzzer, but give us the home team to scrape one out on Thanksgiving night.\nPick: Ravens 26, Bengals 22 | Bengals +7, Under 51.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\nThe New England Patriots and New York Giants both will have their eye on a prize when they meet in Week 13 of the 2025 NFL season at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. on Monday Night Football. However, the clubs are looking to obtain very different prizes.New England (10-2) has a few rewards in its sights, such as its first AFC East title since 2019 and the top overall seed in the conference come playoff time. The Patriots enter Week 13 with a 2.5-game lead over the Buffalo Bills, who have captured the division crown each of the last five seasons, and are a half game ahead of the Denver Broncos (9-2) for the No. 1 seed in the AFC.Mike Vrabel's tenure as head coach of the team with which he won three Super Bowls as a player got off to a rocky start as New England lost two of its first three games this year. However, the Patriots haven't been defeated since, as they enter Monday night's matchup with the Giants having won nine consecutive contests.\nThe Patriots have scored at least 23 points in every game during their winning streak and have won four straight at home by a combined total of 62 points. They now host a Giants squad that has lost six consecutive contests and leads the NFL with five setbacks this season in which it owned a lead in the fourth quarter.New York (2-10) became the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention with last week's 34-27 overtime loss to the Detroit Lions. The Giants possess the worst record in the NFC and are very much alive in the running for the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, as only the Tennessee Titans (1-10) are below them in the league standings.New England has been strong on both sides of the ball this year, ranking eighth in both total offense (359.9 yards) and defense (301.2 yards allowed). The Patriots are sixth in the league in passing (247.5 yards) and seventh in scoring (26.5 points), while they are the second-best team against the run (87.7 yards allowed) and sixth in points allowed (18.8).Drafted third overall in 2024, Drake Maye leads the NFL with 3,130 passing yards and ranks fourth with 21 touchdown tosses. The 23-year-old should come up with a solid performance against the Giants, who are last in the league against the run (157.2 yards allowed), 30th in both total defense (385.0) and points allowed (27.8) and 23rd against the pass (227.8 yards allowed).SportsLine's Inside the Lines team currently doesn't see how the Patriots don't put an end to their three-year postseason drought, and it says a loss to New York won't do much to reduce their chances.According to the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, New England also is an overwhelming favorite to end Buffalo's five-year reign atop the AFC East regardless of the result of Monday night's contest.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 13 WINWITH WEEK 13 LOSSDIFFERENCENew England Patriots99.4%100.0%98.1%1.9%CHANCES OF WINNING AFC EASTTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 13 WINWITH WEEK 13 LOSSDIFFERENCENew England Patriots86.9%88.9%81.6%7.3%Buffalo Bills13.1%17.9%7.4%10.5%Miami Dolphins0.0%0.0%0.0%0.0%New York Jets0.0%0.0%0.0%0.0%The Giants have owned the first overall draft pick twice in their history.

    "body": "\nIn late October, the Colorado Avalanche endured a four-game stretch during which they failed to record a victory. In that span, they lost twice in overtime, once in a shootout and suffered their lone regulation defeat of the 2025-26 NHL season to date - a 3-2 setback against the Boston Bruins on Oct. 25 in Beantown.That period seems as if it was a lifetime ago, as Colorado has gone 12-0-1 since. The Avalanche (17-1-5) won all four of their contests last week and enter Week 8, which will run from Friday to Monday, with a 10-game winning streak.The Tampa Bay Lightning and Minnesota Wild also went undefeated in a Week 7 that spanned 10 days, with the former going 5-0-0 and the latter 4-0-0. The Washington Capitals had an impressive week of their own, winning five of their six games.Conversely, Week 7 was unkind to a number of teams, including the Chicago Blackhawks. After going 4-0-1 over the previous two weeks, the Blackhawks recorded just one victory while suffering three regulation losses and falling once in overtime during Week 7. Thanks to the rough patch, Chicago dropped out of this week's top 10 ratings.Each week during the season, I'll rank the league's top 10 teams based on both the previous week's performances and overall body of work in 2025-26. I'll also give brief synopsis for each club that explains why they're ranked where they are.Let's dive into the power ratings after Week 7 of the 2025-26 NHL season and highlight a few of the teams' notable accomplishments.NHL Week 7 power ratings 1. Colorado Avalanche (4-0-0 in Week 7; 17-1-5 overall)Not only did the Avalanche continue to show that they have the most potent offense in the NHL last week, they demonstrated their ability to keep their opponents at bay. Colorado scored six times in two of its four victories, increasing its league-leading total to 94 goals. The team also finished the week with three consecutive shutouts, with Mackenzie Blackwood sandwiching 35 and 26-save performances against the Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, respectively, around Scott Wedgewood's 22-save effort against the Blackhawks. Wedgewood also registered his first career assist in the Avalanche's 6-3 win against the New York Rangers. Nathan MacKinnon was kept off the scoresheet for just the fourth time this season in Colorado's 1-0 triumph over Chicago but finished the week with four goals and two assists. The 2024 Hart Trophy winner leads the league with 18 goals and 39 points while Cale Makar, who netted three tallies and set up two others, tops all NHL defensemen in goals (nine), assists (21) and points (30).2. Dallas Stars (3-1-1; 15-5-4)Dallas began Week 7 with a 3-2 setback against the New York Islanders that ended its five-game winning streak but earned points in each of its next four contests, going 3-0-1. Jason Robertson had a huge week, tallying in each of the Stars' first four outings of the week to extend his goal-scoring streak to seven games, which tied him with Bill Goldsworthy (1970-71), Neal Broten (1981-82) and Dave Gagner (1992-93) for the second-longest run in franchise history behind Brian Bellows' 10-gamer in 1989-90. The 26-year-old Robertson was kept off the scoresheet in Dallas' 3-2 triumph over the Seattle Kraken on Wednesday, halting both the goal-scoring streak and the eight-game point run during which he collected 11 tallies and seven assists. Tyler Seguin collected seven assists last week, while captain Jamie Benn returned to the lineup and recorded a goal and three assists in five games after missing the Stars' first 19 contests due to a collapsed lung. 3. Tampa Bay Lightning (5-0-0; 14-7-2)Don't look now, but the Lightning have soared to the top of the Atlantic Division thanks to their perfect week. In fact, after winning just one of its first seven games this season (1-4-2), Tampa Bay has been one of the best teams in the league, going 13-3-0. Three-time Art Ross Trophy winner Nikita Kucherov continued his offensive wizardry, registering three goals and eight assists over the Lightning's five contests as he extended his point streak to seven games. Jake Guentzel began Week 7 with his eighth career hat trick in a 5-1 triumph over the New Jersey Devils and finished the week with seven points, Brandon Hagel recorded five goals and four assists over the team's last three contests and Anthony Cirelli netted two tallies and set up three others in the same span. Meanwhile, defenseman Darren Raddysh had a strong week offensively, collecting a goal and five assists after notching only four points over his first 12 games this season.4. Minnesota Wild (4-0-0; 13-7-4)The Wild sandwiched triumphs in a shootout and overtime around a pair of shutout victories last week to extend their winning streak to six games and their points run to nine contests (8-0-1). Defenseman Brock Faber landed on the scoresheet in all four of Minnesota's games, scoring three goals and setting up three others, while Matt Boldy registered four tallies and three assists in Week 7. The 24-year-old Boldy has notched at least one point in seven of his last eight outings and is tied for the team lead with Kirill Kaprizov, who recorded three goals and two assists last week to increase his point total to 28. Filip Gustavsson turned aside all 19 shots he faced in a 5-0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins for his second shutout of the season and Jesper Wallstedt followed with his league-leading third blanking as he made 32 saves in a 3-0 triumph over the Winnipeg Jets.5. Carolina Hurricanes (2-2-1; 14-7-2)The Hurricanes began Week 7 with two wins and a shootout loss to extend their points streak to five games but ended it with back-to-back regulation defeats, which prevented them from rising in these power ratings. Sebastian Aho had the best week for Carolina offensively, recording a goal and four assists to increase his season total to a team-high 23 points. The 28-year-old Finnish center celebrated his 700th NHL game on Wednesday with a pair of assists in the Hurricanes' 4-2 loss to the Rangers. Defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere also was productive, scoring two goals and setting up two others.6. New Jersey Devils (2-3-0; 15-7-1)New Jersey fell three spots in the ratings due to a rough start to Week 7. After ending the previous week with a shootout victory against the Washington Capitals in their first game without Jack Hughes (finger surgery), the Devils felt the star forward's absence as they scored a total of four goals while suffering three consecutive losses to finish their five-game road trip at 2-3-0. The club managed to right the ship as it concluded the week with home triumphs over the Detroit Red Wings and St. Louis Blues. The first overall pick in the 2017 NHL Draft, Nico Hischier has been doing his best to fill Hughes' skates as he racked up five goals and four assists over New Jersey's past five games. The 28-year-old Swiss center enters Week 8 with a streak of three straight multi-point performances, while Timo Meier has scored a goal in three consecutive contests.7. Washington Capitals (5-1-0; 13-9-2)The Capitals entered Week 7 having lost eight of their previous 10 games (2-6-2). They turned things around in a big way, scoring 29 goals while winning five of their six contests. Superstar Alex Ovechkin netted six of the tallies and added a pair of assists, while defenseman John Carlson also racked up eight points (two goals, six assists). The NHL's all-time goals leader, Ovechkin registered his 33rd career hat trick in Washington's 8-4 triumph over the Montreal Canadiens on Nov. 20, tying Brett Hull for fourth place in league history behind Wayne Gretzky (50), Mario Lemieux (40) and Mike Bossy (39). Blue-liner Jakob Chychrun had a tremendous week offensively, collecting five goals and four assists. The 27-year-old enters Week 8 with a four-game goal-scoring streak and a run of nine straight contests with at least one point. 8. Ottawa Senators (3-1-0; 12-7-4)Ottawa played only four games over the 10-day span of Week 7 - all on the road - but won three of them. Each of the four contests were decided by one goal, with the Senators posting 3-2 regulation victories against the Anaheim Ducks and San Jose while defeating the Vegas Golden Knights 4-3 in a shootout. Ottawa trailed both the Ducks and Sharks 2-1 before scoring the equalizer late in the second period and the winning goal in the latter half of the third. Drake Batherson was the hero in Anaheim, tallying with 1:58 remaining in regulation, while Tim Stutzle netted the decisive tally in San Jose with 6:38 left. The 23-year-old Stutzle leads the Senators with 11 goals and 23 points.9. Anaheim Ducks (3-2-0; 14-8-1)The Ducks return to the top 10 after going 0-3-0 in Week 6 and dropping out of the ratings. Anaheim played five one-goal games last week and won three, defeating Vegas and the Utah Mammoth in overtime and the Boston Bruins in regulation. Cutter Gauthier, Troy Terry and 19-year-old right wing Beckett Sennecke each recorded at last one point in all five of the Ducks' contests, while Leo Carlsson landed on the scoresheet in each of the team's last four outings. Gauthier enters Week 8 with a five-game assist streak and Terry is in the midst of a four-game run.10. Vegas Golden Knights (2-1-2; 10-5-8)The Golden Knights began last week with a pair of victories and ended it with three straight defeats, although one took place in overtime and another came in a shootout. Jack Eichel scored three goals and set up four others over his last four games to increase his team-leading total to 31 points and tie him for fifth in the NHL. Meanwhile, 22-year-old right wing Braeden Bowman landed on the scoresheet in all five of Vegas' contests, recording three goals and three assists to become the first undrafted rookie to post a five-game point streak since Taro Hirose accomplished the feat in 2018-19 while with the Red Wings. Captain Mark Stone returned to the lineup on Wednesday and tallied in the Golden Knights' 4-3 shootout loss to Ottawa. The 33-year-old right wing, who had missed 16 contests with an upper-body injury, has registered a total of 14 points this season and at least one in each of his seven games.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Plenty of times in recent college football history, there have been cases where a rivalry is created out of thin air and foisted upon fan bases as a real thing. That could've been the case when Nebraska joined the Big Ten and needed a new team to play on Black Friday after spending the previous two decades facing Oklahoma or Colorado.Iowa seemed a natural choice, but the Hawkeyes had other traditional rivals in the Big Ten, so nothing was guaranteed.Well, here we are, 15 years later, and there's very little pretending still being done. These fan bases are going after each other all year long, and some on both sides might even tell you they dislike the other more than their other older, traditional rivals. Both teams enter the game licking some wounds. Iowa was a playoff contender a few weeks ago, but close losses to Oregon and USC ended those hopes. Nebraska had a shot too before quarterback Dylan Raiola broke his leg.Now they enter the final week of the regular season with one thing in mind: ruin the other's Thanksgiving weekend.\nIowa vs. Nebraska: Need to know  Iowa has controlled the Big Ten rivalry: These two played plenty of times before sharing a conference, and Nebraska leads the all-time series 30-22-3. However, Nebraska's lead was much larger before it entered the Big Ten. Nebraska won the first two meetings in 2011 and 2012, but Iowa's taken 10 of 12 since, including the last two. Iowa has also won six straight meetings at Memorial Stadium.  Iowa loves November: The Hawkeyes lost their first two games in November this season, which is a rarity for them. Those losses dropped their record in the month to 19-4 since the 2020 season. It's the fourth-highest win percentage among FBS teams in that time.  Nebraska looking to end a nearly decade-long drought: If the Cornhuskers get the win here it'll give them a record of 8-4 on the season. That's a big deal because it would be the first time the Huskers won eight games in a season since 2016. It would also be the first time they won five Big Ten games since that same season when they finished 6-3 in conference play.\n  Where to watch Iowa vs. Nebraska live  Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Memorial Stadium -- Lincoln, NebraskaTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppStreaming on Paramount+ PremiumIowa vs. Nebraska prediction, picks\nWe throw out the record books in rivalry games like this because anything can happen, so I'm not sure who will win, or who will cover. However, I don't expect there to be a lot of points scored in this one. It's going to be cold at Memorial Stadium, and with TJ Lateef at QB for the Cornhuskers now, this team has leaned heavily on its rushing attack. Iowa's been a run-heavy team all year. Unless we see a lot of explosive rushing plays (not out of question) or numerous defensive and special teams scores (also not out of the question!), I don't think either offense does enough to put a lot of points on the board. After all, the last two meetings have finished with 13-10 scores.  Pick: Under 38.5Who will win and cover in each Week 14 college football rivalry game?

    "body": "\n        With his team battling for a playoff spot, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones will try to play through a fibula injury that limited his practice participation over the past two weeks. Jones is dealing with a fractured fibula, NFL Media reports. Jones was a surprise addition to the Colts' injury report when the team returned from their Week 11 bye. Jones initially appeared on the Colts' Week 12 injury report with a calf injury. Prior to the Colts' game against the Chiefs, CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson reported that Jones in fact was dealing with a fibula injury while adding that he was not in jeopardy of missing that game. Despite the injury, Jones played in the Colts' Week 12 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. He went 19 of 31 for 181 yards and two touchdowns in the Colts' 23-20 overtime loss. The Chiefs failed to sack Jones, but he ran the ball just three times for 16 yards. \"It was just something that was hanging over, realized it last week,\" said Jones, who was a full participant in practice. \"Just trying to get treatment and make sure I'm in the best spot that I can be.\" \nJones also made it clear that he has every intention of playing in the Colts' upcoming home game against the Houston Texans. \"I'll be ready to go on Sunday,\" he said. \"Obviously, (I) was out there last week. I'm good to go.\"\nJones' health is clearly a cause for concern for the Colts, who, at 8-3, are just one game ahead of the Jacksonville Jaguars and are two up on the Texans in the AFC South standings. Jones, 28, in the midst of the best season of his career. \nIn his first season with the Colts, Jones is completing a career-high 69.1% of his passes. He is also on pace to set new single-season career-highs in passing yards and touchdown passes. While his success so far has made him a somewhat early candidate for NFL Comeback Player of the Year, Jones is remained focused on winning games while helping the Colts snap their four-year playoff drought. \"We've got to keep winning games,\" he said in a recent interview with CBS Sports. \"We've got to keep keep taking care of business week after week. It's been a good start to this point ... but there's certainly things we haven't done as well at times that we need to clean up and be sharper with going forward, so that will be a focus of ours.\n\"But yeah, we're confident. I think we're confident in our team and our ability to go a long way and to continue to play good football, but we've got to win week after week.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 16 Texas hosts No. 3 Texas A&M in a fierce rivalry game at Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium in Austin. The Longhorns try to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive after moving to 8-3 after a dynamic victory against Arkansas. Texas A&M has blazed out to a historic 11-0 start for the first time since 1992. The last time the Aggies won 10 games was 2012, the year Johnny Manziel won the Heisman Trophy. In their most recent SEC game, Texas A&M overcame a 30-3 halftime deficit to shock South Carolina 31-30 to stay unbeaten and virtually clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff. Texas has not hosted this rivalry game since 2010, a 24-17 victory for Texas A&M. However, the Longhorns took down the Aggies 17-7 in the return of the rivalry last year at Kyle Field. Emotions will be high for the return to Austin.   Texas vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  Breakout pass rusher: Texas A&M lost multiple defensive linemen to the NFL last season. However, Cashius Howell has stepped up and emerged as one of the best in the sport. The former Bowling Green transfer was a rotation player last season, but has since emerged to lead the SEC with 11.5 sacks. Amazingly, he has recorded a sack in seven of his eight Power Four games. Against a Texas offensive line dealing with major issues, Howell can change the game. Resurgent Arch: Texas quarterback Arch Manning had a slow start to the year as he acclimated to the job of being QB1, but has found his footing in the second half of the year. Manning now has four straight games of completing more than 60% of his passes with 13 touchdowns to only two interceptions. Texas is 3-1 in those games. Against Arkansas, he became the first Texas QB to score touchdowns via pass, rush and receiving in one game. Texas A&M will be a substantially tougher challenge, but Manning is playing his best ball. \nStrength on weakness: Despite coming into the year with a highly-rated defense, Texas' secondary has been a major liability. In SEC play, the Longhorns rank last in the conference in passing defense, surrendering more than 295 yards per game. Over the last four games, they're giving up 325 passing yards per game. Texas A&M boasts the SEC's best receiving corps behind standouts Mario Craver and KC Concepcion. The Longhorns will have their hands full.   Where to watch Texas vs. Texas A&M live  Date: Friday, Nov. 28 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Location: Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium -- Austin, Texas  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Texas vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  From a matchup perspective, Texas A&M clearly has the upper hand. Their passing offense will gave Texas' defense fits. Top pass rusher Cashius Howell is a matchup nightmare against an inconsistent Longhorns offensive line. Even their special teams has created opportunities. But in a rivalry game of this magnitude, it will be a mental game above all. Mike Elko's squad has stepped up in the biggest moments, and they will do the same to clinch their first spot in the SEC Championship Game and finish 12-0. Pick: Texas A&M -2.5\n\n

    "body": "\n        No. 19 Tennessee is set to host No. 14 Vanderbilt Saturday for the 120th meeting all-time between two of the SEC's oldest rivals. There's plenty at stake for both teams, as they look to solidify their postseason standing in the final week of the regular season. Though the Vols and the Commodores first met in 1892, this will be the first time in series history that both are ranked inside the AP Top 25 -- and the College Football Playoff Rankings -- at kickoff. This is also just the fifth time that Vanderbilt can boast an AP ranking entering its game against Tennessee and the first since 1958. The Commodores are 1-3 in those meetings. They've also just won once in 42 meetings against AP-ranked Tennessee teams. That one win came in 2016. So history certainly is not on Vanderbilt's side as it looks to build its case for a College Football Playoff appearance. The Commodores have also lost their last six in a row against Tennessee. They have not won in Knoxville in eight years. \nBut Tennessee has undergone its own share of struggles this season. The Vols have yet to down a ranked team and they have struggled against some of the SEC's lower-tier teams like Mississippi State and Arkansas. There's still motivation to send the year out on a high note and secure a quality bowl game. Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt: Need to know  Biggest game in Vanderbilt history: The stakes are simple for Vanderbilt: Win, and it gives itself a good chance to snag an at-large bid in the College Football Playoff. That the Commodores have a chance to do this on the road against their oldest active rival only adds to the importance. Vanderbilt is also seeking 10 wins in a single season for the first time in program history. The Commodores are the only current Power Four team without a 10-win campaign on record. There's no doubt that this is the biggest game that Vanderbilt has ever played, especially since the Commodores have not so much as won a conference title in the modern era of college football.     \nA lot on the line for Tennessee, too: Tennessee is virtually out of the College Football Playoff race at this point. The Vols have yet to snag a victory against an FBS team with a winning record and they're 0-3 against ranked opponents this season. But they do have a chance to win nine games for a fourth straight season, something they have not done since 1995-99. For rivalry purposes, Tennessee can also spoil Vanderbilt's Cinderella story which, after winning at Florida for the first time in 22 years, would be a nice cherry on top of a decent season for the Vols.    Vanderbilt's Pavia closing in on another record: Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia already holds the Vanderbilt record for most touchdowns passing in a season at 26. He leapt past former Commodore star Kyle Shurmur in the process. Now, he's just 254 yards away from surpassing Kurt Page for the most yards passing in a single season in program history. Pavia, who has 2,924 yards through the air on the year, is also close to becoming just the fourth Vanderbilt quarterback to exceed 3,000 yards passing in a single season. Both feats are certainly doable against a Tennessee secondary that ranks near the bottom of the SEC.   Where to watch Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt live  Date: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET  Location: Neyland Stadium -- Knoxville, Tennessee  TV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)\n  Tennessee vs. Vanderbilt prediction, picks  Tennessee currently ranks 14th in the SEC in total defense (378.5 yards per game). Vanderbilt ranks 11th in the SEC in total defense (353.4 ypg). Tennessee has held just one conference opponent below 30 points all season. Vanderbilt allowed an average of 32 points in its two games against top-20 foes this season. Tennessee quarterback Joey Aguilar is just the fifth 3,000-yard passer in program history.

    "body": "\n        It doesn't get much better than The Game this week. Bragging rights, an undefeated season and College Football Playoff spots are on the line when Michigan hosts Ohio State on Saturday in the most heated rivalry in the sport.It's been a year since No. 1 Ohio State (11-0) last lost a game, and the culprit for that setback is No. 15 Michigan (9-2). No one will forget that improbable upset in Columbus, but knocking off the Buckeyes this year may be a bigger challenge. The Wolverines are gunning for their fifth straight victory in the series, which hasn't been done since the 1920s. The Buckeyes roll into Michigan Stadium with the nation's best defense, allowing only 7.6 points per game, the second-best mark by an FBS team over the last 30 years. Heisman Trophy contenders Julian Sayin, who is on pace to set the FBS single-season record for completion percentage, and Jeremiah Smith lead an explosive Buckeyes offense.Michigan is undefeated at home but has faced only one ranked opponent: No. 18 Oklahoma on the road.\nSaturday marks the 50th time both teams are ranked in The Game, the most between two teams in the AP poll era (1936). The Wolverines last defeated the No. 1 team in the AP poll in 1984 (Miami). Ohio State vs. Michigan: Need to knowHow healthy is Ohio State?  Star receivers Jeremiah Smith and Carnell Tate sat out last week's win against Rutgers, but it appears both will play against Michigan, even though coach Ryan Day said earlier this week they are \"day to day.\" Smith and Tate are the Buckeyes' top two pass catchers, leading the way with 902 and 711 yards, respectively. Smith was held in check in last season's loss to the Wolverines, recording only 35 receiving yards.Can Michigan's offense keep it up? The Wolverines are without star running back Justice Haynes, and even backup Jordan Marshall sat out last week, and yet they managed to score 45 points and record 445 yards in a road win at Maryland. Freshman Bryce Underwood has thrown for 200-plus yards in each of the last two games -- both on the road. Michigan is 0-2 when falling below 350 total yards of offense; Ohio State is allowing only 206.6 yards. The key is Michigan's strong offensive line creating holes against Ohio State's stellar defensive front.\nMichigan's mind games: Hear us out: Is it possible that Day has a mental block when it comes to Michigan? The Ohio State coach is 52-1 in the Big Ten against all teams not named Michigan. He's 1-4 against the Wolverines.Sack Sayin: If Michigan wants to slow down this Ohio State offense, it needs to pressure quarterback Julian Sayin. He's completing passes at a record-breaking pace, and with the best receiver corps in the country, the Wolverines can't afford chunk plays. That's where a star like edge rusher Derrick More becomes so important. He has 9.5 sacks and 28 QB pressures.Wolverines' playoff hopes: As if a rivalry game wasn't enough to get the blood flowing, Michigan is likely also playing for a spot in the College Football Playoff. The Wolverines enter Saturday ranked No. 15 in the CFP, and though many teams above them are expected to hold serve, it will be difficult to keep them ranked below 11th in the final rankings if they defeat the previously unbeaten Buckeyes.\nHow to watch Ohio State vs. Michigan liveDate: Saturday, Nov. 29 | Time: 12 p.m. ETLocation: Michigan Stadium -- Ann Arbor, MichiganTV: FOX | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Ohio State vs. Michigan prediction, picksIt hasn't been easy picking this game, and last season's result certainly provides a pause whenever assuming the Buckeyes could win by more than one touchdown, even on the road inside Michigan Stadium. The numbers show us that this Ohio State defense is even better than last season's, and though Michigan's offense has found some success of late, this defense is built differently, allowing barely over 200 yards. Don't touch the spread.  Pick: Ohio State SU\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n

Woods was already sidelined from playing golf after rupturing his Achilles this spring.\"After experiencing pain and lack of mobility in my back, I consulted with doctors and surgeons to have tests taken,\" Woods explained. \"The scans determined that I had a collapsed disc in L4/5, disc fragments and a compromised spinal canal. I opted to have my disc replaced yesterday, and I already know I made a good decision for my health and my back.\"Woods has recovered from multiple back surgeries throughout his career, though they have certainly compounded on one another over time. While Tiger's statement referred to the surgery as successful, no timetable was offered for a potential return to golf.Already rehabilitating following surgery for a torn Achilles that cost him the entire 2025 season, Woods last played golf in TGL, the simulator league he runs alongside Rory McIlroy. Fans were hopeful he would return for the second season when it begins at the end of December. However, October back surgery seemingly make Woods' participation in this TGL campaign unlikely, and it certainly puts his status for the 2026 major championship season in doubt.\nThe list of surgeries and procedures Woods has undergone throughout his career is now well over a dozen. This latest procedure is Woods' seventh back surgery since 2014 and his second in 13 months.Tiger has also gone through numerous knee, ankle, leg and Achilles surgeries over his career. Every time he announced another surgery, Woods has stated his determination to fight his way back to the top of the golf world with his 2019 Masters win perhaps the greatest triumph of his career. \nNow, with Woods just over two months away from turning 50 years old, he faces another daunting physical challenge.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        When it comes to doing the little things right, there wasn't a team in college football checking those boxes at a higher rate this season than third-ranked Oregon entering Saturday's unbeaten showdown with No. 7 Indiana. However, there's plenty for Dan Lanning and staff to comb over in the film room now after the Ducks' 30-20 loss, a stunner that was Oregon's first regular-season setback as members of the Big Ten and snapped the nation's longest home winning streak.Oregon tried to follow Lanning's halftime direction to \"run its race\" after intermission and tied the game on Brandon Finney Jr.'s interception return for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter before fundamentals failed down the stretch.Indiana crossed the finish line at a faster pace, earmarking its first road victory in program history against an opponent ranked inside the AP poll's top 5 by winning the decisive moments late. That included Fernando Mendoza's 9-yard touchdown strike on third down to Elijah Surratt against an all-out blitz with 6:23 left before the Hoosiers followed that up by intercepting Dante Moore on Oregon's next possession.\nOregon's physical play from its cornerbacks throughout backfired on the Ducks in the second half, the first evidence coming after a pair of defensive pass interference flags aided Indiana's go-ahead touchdown possession. Roman Hemby's 2-yard touchdown run, his second of the contest, pushed the Hoosiers ahead 20-13 with 2:16 to play in the third quarter.During a game in which Oregon's rushing attack never got going and the offense struggled on third down thanks to several long-yardage situations, the Ducks tried to make up for it in other areas, notably on special teams and on a couple occasions defensively prior to the dam breaking midway through the fourth quarter.Ranked No. 1 in the Big Ten coming into the contest in fewest explosive plays allowed this season and fewest turnovers, Oregon was out front in turnover margin after Finney's pick and was holding the conference's top rushing offense well below its season average of 268.7 yards per game before Indiana churned clock late.\nHowever, Moore followed with two interceptions under pressure, twice as much as his season total coming in, and Mendoza moved the chain several times with chunk plays in the final frame.The structurally sound team we've come to expect under Lanning at Oregon, at least for a week, struggled to do the little things right late.Details matter for DucksThere was a series of plays in the third quarter with the Ducks trailing 13-10 that exemplified their focus on what was needed to take out a fellow top-10 team, but it wasn't enough. After forcing a three-and-out to open the second half, Oregon got the look it wanted and appeared to call for a fake punt near midfield, but James Ferguson-Reynolds decided to boot it off-balanced with a rusher approaching.\nFerguson-Reynolds' kick rolled down to the 2-yard line, before the Ducks forced another quick empty possession by the Hoosiers and flipped the field with their next drive starting at Indiana's 38 after a punt. Ferguson-Reynolds' smart special teams decision is one that doesn't show up in the box score but is the high-level play it takes to win a close game against a fellow elite team.The ensuing Oregon possession ended with a game-tying field goal that came after a fourth-and-9 completion over the middle from Moore to Jeremiah McClellan on an in-route to put the Ducks near the red zone.During Finney's interception return that tied the game at 20 in the fourth quarter, the defensive back avoided the umpire on the play and stepped in front of Mendoza's throw intended for E.J. Williams. \nIt was only Mendoza's second interception of the campaign and resulted in the Ducks' second biggest takeaway of the season at the time, the first coming in last month's double-overtime win at Penn State when Dillon Thieneman drifted into coverage and baited Drew Allar for the victory-clinching takeaway.After Finney's defensive score, Oregon's offense turned it over twice the rest of the way, a nauseating failure for a team usually adept at keeping it out of the hands of the opposition.\n            ",

It was a matchup of two very different contenders: one freshly on the upswing in Detroit, which had just established itself as a potential force thanks to a late-year push under coach Dan Campbell; the other firmly entrenched as a powerhouse in Kansas City, which had just outdueled the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII for the second ring of Patrick Mahomes' career.Three years later, both Detroit and Kansas City remain NFL heavyweights. But they're once again in very different places. This time, the Lions are the unquestioned juggernauts, easily leading the league in points per game (34.8) a year after cruising to the NFC's No. 1 playoff seed. The Chiefs, meanwhile, have a deeper postseason resume thanks to five Super Bowl appearances in the last six years, but at 2-3, they're in the midst of maybe the sloppiest slog of the vaunted Mahomes era.Bet Chiefs vs. Lions at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket.

This pertains exclusively to the Chiefs, who somehow still rank in the top 10 in terms of average offensive yardage but are leaning heavily upon their quarterback to carry a one-dimensional attack. Mahomes remains a magician, as evidenced by his team-high 190 rushing yards via desperate scrambles, and Isiah Pacheco is at least gaining some steam in a rotational role in recent weeks. But there's no real steady rhythm with the rushing attack, with the aging Kareem Hunt still a face of the committee, putting added pressure on Mahomes' aerial work.Do the Chiefs stand a chance of defending the run? Not only is Kansas City struggling to move the ball consistently on the ground, but Steve Spagnuolo's defense is also pressing to plug holes against opposing rushing attacks, surrendering more than 120 yards per game. That spells big trouble against a Lions team with maybe the best 1-2 punch in the league; both Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery are on pace for 1,000-yard seasons as the lightning and thunder of Detroit's all-star lineup. Nick Bolton is a tackle machine at the heart of the Chiefs' defensive efforts, but this could be an uphill battle.Which top edge rusher will steal the spotlight? Aidan Hutchinson is practically the face of the Lions' defense, and he's already logged five sacks and three forced fumbles on the year. He should have a favorable matchup against Chiefs right tackle Jawaan Taylor. But K.C. has a bona fide pocket disruptor of its own in George Karlaftis, who leads the club with six tackles for loss in the middle of a breakout campaign. If Karlaftis can find a way to best Penei Sewell off the edge, putting heat on Jared Goff's typically clean operation, it could go a long way in slowing the Lions' track-team fireworks.You can bet Chiefs vs. Lions at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nX factor to watch\nWhile the Chiefs have been streaky with the ball in their hands, Mahomes has generally done a good job of controlling the rock, throwing just two interceptions through five games. Still, the more he has to make something out of nothing, the more he tends to put the ball in harm's way. Enter Kerby Joseph, who's racked up a whopping 20 interceptions since he began his career with the Lions back in 2022. This man is a pick magnet on the back end, showcasing elite range and ball-tracking whenever opportunities present themselves. If anyone's going to rob Kansas City of a possession in this one, it's probably going to be him.Chiefs vs. Lions prediction, pick\nWhen these two teams met at Arrowhead Stadium to kick off the 2023 season, the Lions escaped with a 21-20 victory, announcing to the rest of the NFL they'd finally arrived as contenders. Now, the book is out on Detroit as a title candidate, and yet Dan Campbell's aggression and general manager Brad Holmes' all-star assembly remain a force. We're not ready to say the Chiefs no longer belong on the same plane, but it's clear, five games into 2025, Kansas City is even more of a makeshift outfit than usual.Will Mahomes and Co. be motivated to rebound from Week 5's prime-time loss? Sure. But when have we ever questioned the Chiefs' motivations? This is about talent, strategy and execution, and right now, the Lions are clearly better on all fronts. They've got splashier weapons. They've got undying boldness. They've got momentum. While Kansas City may be scrappy and seasoned, the Lions are firing on all cylinders, and their ability to find space both on the ground and through the air should help them prevail.Will it be tight like the last time they met? We'd actually bet against it. The Chiefs should keep this within a score while hosting the Sunday night affair, but Detroit's got enough firepower to take care of business decisively.\nPick: Lions 31, Chiefs 26 | Lions +2.5, Over 53\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

For the Jacksonville Jaguars, their primetime victory over the Kansas City Chiefs Monday night was more than just a major upset of the perennial champions of the AFC and the NFL's defining franchise of the last decade. It also etched into the minds of Duval County certain moments -- from Devin Lloyd's 99-yard pick six to Trevor Lawrence's improbable game-winning touchdown after stumbling and falling to the ground -- that will now live permanently in franchise history, and could serve as the spark to even greater things down the road.At 4-1 and tied for the AFC South lead only one year after finishing as one of the worst teams in the league, the Jaguars have become one of the biggest surprises in the NFL in their first season under new coach Liam Coen. And now, their objective is to defend their home turf yet again and improve to 5-1 in their Week Six matchup with the Seattle Seahawks, who will come to Jacksonville coming off of a hotly-contested shootout loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Where to watch Seahawks vs. Jaguars liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: EverBank Stadium -- Jacksonville, Fla.TV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Jaguars -1.5; O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings)   Seahawks vs. Jaguars: Need to knowDevin Lloyd is having a breakout season. Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd took a notable place in the franchise record books, and a permanent place in the imaginations of Jaguars fans, when he intercepted Patrick Mahomes and returned it 99 yards for a touchdown last week. Lloyd's decisive play highlighted not only the emergence of the Jaguars defense under defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile, but also Lloyd's personal breakout in his fourth NFL season. Lloyd has had four interceptions and five total takeaways in his last four games, earning him AFC Defensive Player of the Month honors for September and making him a player that the Seahawks are going to have to account for at all times.Hit the road, 'Hawks. While losing in a shootout might happen to any team in any environment, the continued struggles of the Seahawks at home at Lumen Field has gone from a curiosity to an outright mystifying inversion of the way things are supposed to be. Under coach Mike Macdonald, the Seahawks have gone just 4-12 at home, but are a formidable 9-1 on the road in that same span. Even with the inherent disadvantage a West Coast team has in traveling to the East Coast -- and playing in a 1 o'clock game with their body clocks set far earlier -- a trip to Jacksonville may not be the worst thing in the world for Seattle, even if they just can't figure out why they can't put things together for their home fans.\nSeahawks vs. Jaguars prediction, pick\nI'm looking Jacksonville's way, and its defense is a big reason why. With the Jaguars coming off of a signature win against the Chiefs I expect them to come into this matchup with tons of energy and full buy-in, which is bad news for any other team that might be expecting to play the Same Old Jags. Considering that the Seahawks lost a week ago thanks to a critical Sam Darnold interception at an inopportune time, I don't think this is the sort of opponent that Seattle can expect to get right against. Pick: Jaguars -1.5; Under 47.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

Bo Nix and the Broncos enter Week 6 on the heels of their second straight victory, ending the Eagles unbeaten streak with a 21-17 come-from-behind win in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, Justin Fields and the Jets continue their quest to get into the win column, most recently giving up 20 second-quarter points to the Dallas Cowboys in a 37-22 loss.Kickoff from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is set for 9:30 a.m. ET.

The run defense has been solid through five weeks and only allowed 45 rushing yards to Philadelphia, so the Broncos should have their work cut out for them against the Breece Hall-led Jets run game. Nix came up big in the fourth quarter against the Eagles and exited Philadelphia without throwing a pick -- a big confidence boost ahead of the Broncos' tenth international game. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Jets can coverNew York has covered the spread twice this season and their best shot at keeping Sunday's game close -- if not ending their winless skid -- is to keep hammering away on the ground. Hall has a team-leading 305 rushing yards and Fields adds 204 yards of his own. The 26-year-old quarterback finished Week 5 32-for-46 for 283 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions, but he will need to connect with Garrett Wilson and the receiving corps much earlier than the fourth quarter if the Jets are going to keep Denver from running away with the game. See which team to back at SportsLine. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Jets vs. Broncos  picksFor the NFL London Game in Week 6, the model is leaning under the total, and also says one side of the spread hits in more than 50% of simulations. See what it is at SportsLine.Who wins Broncos vs. Jets, and which side of the spread hits more than 50% of the time?

    "body": "\n        If the season ended today, the Indianapolis Colts would be the No. 1 seed in the playoffs and get the AFC's lone bye week. If someone would have made such a statement in the middle of the summer, a person hearing such a comment would have been within their right to assume that the heat had gotten the better of the person's voicing such a thought.But the reality is that the 4-1 Indianapolis Colts are a team to watch in the fall of 2025. They are coming off a dominant 40-6 win over the Las Vegas Raiders. Their only loss this season came from the Los Angeles Rams, who defeated them 27-20 in Week 4. Aside from that one hiccup, everything has been going Indy's way.The same can not be said of the 2-3 Arizona Cardinals who are mired in a three-game losing streak. The Cards appears to be snakebit as some of their own odd miscues have paved for their opponents to kick field goals as time expires over that span. Last week, the Tennessee Titans defeated them, 22-21.Here's everything you need to know to watch the game, with betting odds and a prediction for the game.\nWhere to watch Cardinals vs. Colts liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 1 p.m. ETLocation: Lucas Oil Stadium  -- Indianapolis, IndianaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Colts -6.5; O/U 47.5 (via DraftKings)    Cardinals vs. Colts: Need to knowColts are in protection mode. The Colts have done an excellent job at protecting quarterback Daniel Jones. Indy has allowed just four sacks, best in the league. Their 34 yards loss by sacks is the second-best in the league, behind the Denver Broncos.Jonathan Taylor is having a career season. The Colts running back currently leads the league in rushing yards, with 480, ahead of Buffalo Bills' James Cook (450). His 96.0 average yards per game, 94 attempts and six rushing touchdowns are also the most in the league. Taylor is hard to stop and the Colts offensive line is assisting in his success this year, making holes and blocking for him.Will Cardinals get over incident? The Cardinals fined Jonathan Gannon $100,000 for his sideline interacting with running back Emari Demercado during last week's loss. Last week, Demarcado dropped the ball before the end zone to conclude a 72-yard run, causing a touchback for the Titans rather than a touchdown for the Cardinals. A clearly frustrated Gannon looked like he made contact with Demarcado and later apologized for the incident, saying he \"didn't feel great about it.\"\nCardinals vs. Colts prediction, pick\nThe Cardinals have lost a lot of close games this season, but I don't think this one will be close. I think the Colts can expose some of the issues the Cardinals have and find the end zone often. Pick: Colts, Over 47.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        COLUMBIA, Missouri -- Ty Simpson stood in the same end zone where he'd thrown Alabama's go-ahead touchdown an hour earlier, flipping through a packet of stats, shaking his head as his eyes darted down each page.\"Too many sacks,\" he said, pausing as he scanned the page. \"Didn't throw the ball great.\"He let out a soft, irritated \"mmcht,\" the sound of a perfectionist still fuming.You'd have thought No. 8 Alabama (5-1, 3-0 SEC) had just lost at No. 14 Missouri (5-1, 1-1). Instead, the Tide snapped Missouri's 15-game home winning streak, and Simpson delivered when it mattered most -- twice converting fourth downs on the decisive drive to seal a 27-24 win at Faurot Field.For a perfectionist like Simpson, frustration comes easily. But this road win marked another step forward for a program that's finally learning to finish after a year of faltering in close games\n\"A year ago, we were not making the plays in the critical moments to win games,\" Alabama's second-year coach Kalen DeBoer said.The Tide made the big plays when they needed them most in the second half Saturday. The Tide converted all three fourth-down attempts, and none were bigger than their final two: a perfect 29-yard pass to freshman Lotzeir Brooks on fourth-and-8 and a 1-yard touchdown throw a few plays later to a wide-open Daniel Hill on the left side of the end zone with 3:16 remaining.\"I appreciate Coach DeBoer and [offensive coordinator Ryan] Grubb for giving us the green light,\" Simpson said. \"We have tons of confidence in our guys, and big-time players make big-time plays in big-time games. Lotzeir Brooks is a big-time player. For a freshman, that dude's unreal.\"\nEven more impressive: the Tide flipped Missouri's own formula against them. Missouri came in leading the nation in time of possession and ranking second in rushing, but Alabama stole both. The Tide held the ball for 38:33, including a nine-minute march in the third quarter. \"There's times I know we wanted to put more points on the board ourselves, but it's part of the game when you play a team like this,\" DeBoer said.Mizzou only ran for 167 yards, nearly half its average that ranked No. 2 among power teams. The Tide held the nation's leading rusher, Ahmad Hardy, to under 100 yards for the first time in eight games dating back to last season.\n\"Rush defense,\" said DeBoer, \"I think we took another step in the right direction.\"But back to that fourth-down decision with 3:54 remaining. The Tide led 20-17 and faced a difficult choice in no man's land at Mizzou's 38. The Tide was within one yard of their fourth-down book recommending a kick, but DeBoer didn't pay much attention to the analytics. \"It wasn't off that,\" he told CBS Sports. \"It was more about a gut feeling.\"One play earlier, a third-and-24 pass to Kevin Riley, in which the running back powered forward to pick up difficult yards against Mizzou's high-pursuit defense, had emboldened the head coach and his players.\n\"I can see us battling,\" DeBoer said. \"There's a feel you have, a belief you have, and a lot of it is on the body language, on the execution. I just feel when you've got a quarterback with some guys around him that can go make plays, you gotta let them play.\"On the left hash, Grubb dialed up a tight trips look. Missouri showed two-deep, man under coverage. One receiver ran an out route near the sticks but was covered. Another crossed the formation and was smothered.That left 5-foot-9 freshman Lotzeir Brooks streaking downfield against corner Toriano Pride Jr., who played perfect coverage. Simpson launched. Pride's right arm pressed into Brooks' chest, but the freshman twisted, extended his arms and snatched the ball before crashing to the turf at the 9.\n\"Brooks made a good move, good route to get open,\" Simpson said. \"I put it where he could try to catch it.\"First down.Underclassmen, particularly a pair of freshmen, played a big part for the short-handed Tide. Brooks was exceptional, leading all receivers with 58 yards on four catches. Redshirt freshman running back Kevin Riley also scored on a reception. Alabama entered the game hobbled, with star receiver Ryan Williams limited after missing time in practices during the week with an unspecified injury. Go-to running back Jam Miller was knocked out with a concussion after converting a fourth down early in the fourth quarter. Freshman receiver Derek Meadows was pulled from he game with a concussion on a violent hit late in the first quarter.\nStill, there were issues. Mizzou marched down the field on the opening drive to take a 7-0 lead. Simpson fumbled on the first play of the second half, setting up a Mizzou touchdown. The quarterback also stumbled after a snap on first down at the 1-yard line, leading to a 4-yard loss and the Tide settling for a field goal rather than a touchdown with 9 seconds remaining in the third quarter.Simpson was visibly frustrated on the sideline between possessions, a look that lingered as he scanned the stat sheet on the very field where he earlier made big throws to help win the game. He said he \"got after\" his teammates in the locker room, adding that \"it starts with me.\"He didn't sugarcoat his feelings.\"That game should have been put away a long time ago,\" Simpson said. \"That's disappointing on my part. We're such a good offense but we've got to be better in the second half. We had a lot of things going in the first (half) and we just got to put it away.\"\nMizzou pulled within 27-24 with 1:40 remaining, and the Tigers' defense forced a three-and-out to give them another chance at a win. Alabama's defense, however, forced Mizzou quarterback Beau Pribula into a second interception to end the threat with 37 seconds remaining in regulation.\"We pride ourselves on being unbreakable,\" said linebacker Deontae Lawson, who co-led the Tide with seven tackles. \"That's our team slogan. We just know that we're going to execute in those situations.\"That resilience didn't exist a year ago, making this win against a top-15 opponent that entered the day with the nation's second-longest home winning streak so impressive. \nA year ago, they failed on fourth-and-22 against Tennessee, setting up a field goal in the final two minutes of a 24-17 loss. Against Vanderbilt, Jalen Milroe fumbled in the fourth to help Vanderbilt take a two-touchdown lead.That narrative has changed in 2025. Even when Simpson and the Tide made mistakes Saturday, they countered them with critical possessions – a 9-minute possession in the third quarter – and two fourth-down conversions on their final scoring drive.Simpson finished 23 of 31 passing for 200 yards and three touchdowns. He also absorbed four sacks.\n\"There's just things that could have been cleaner,\" DeBoer said. \"It's not bad, but he knows when it's perfect and that's what he wants. He wants it perfect. He wants to score every possession, so a little frustration isn't bad. In the end, he does a good job of regrouping himself. Our guys regroup around him, they feed off of his confidence, and that's what matters to me.\"Next up is Tennessee, the flagship program of Simpson's home state and a chance for Alabama to avenge last year's stumble. A win would push this run against ranked teams to four straight.\"That's why we came here,\" Simpson said. \"That's why I stayed. Life in the SEC. Good, that's what we want, that's what we came here for. It's going to make us better in the long run.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 130th chapter of The Deep South's Oldest Rivalry takes center stage on Saturday when No. 10 Georgia travels to Auburn for a showdown at Jordan-Hare Stadium. The past dozen years have been lopsided, with the Bulldogs (4-1) claiming all but one meeting since 2014. For the Tigers (3-2), it's about more than turning the tide in the rivalry -- they're also fighting to avoid an 0-3 start in SEC play for the third straight season. Beating Georgia would give Auburn a much-needed jolt.\"Everything is still in front of us, and it starts with an incredible rivalry game that you ought to just relish the opportunity to play in,\" Auburn coach Hugh Freeze said Monday. \"... Yes, there's always a sense of urgency because it's the next SEC game, but you can't run from the fact that this rivalry game means something to a lot of people.\"Bet Auburn vs. Georgia at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The last time the Tigers defeated Georgia was in 2017 at Jordan-Hare Stadium, a 40-17 win during Kirby Smart's second season, though Georgia later won the rematch in that year's SEC title game.\nThe Bulldogs start arguably their toughest three-game stretch of the 2025 season, continuing with a clash against No. 4 Ole Miss and followed by a showdown with a dangerous Florida team on the horizon. So, Saturday's trip to Auburn could set the tone for how Georgia handles this upcoming slate.Where to watch Georgia vs. Auburn liveDate: Saturday, Oct. 11 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Jordan-Hare Stadium -- Auburn, AlabamaTV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Georgia vs. Auburn: Need to know  Where's Georgia's pass rush?: The Bulldogs are getting pressure on just 28.2% of drop backs by the opposing quarterback. That ranks tied for 112th in the FBS and last in the SEC. Georgia has just seven sacks on the season and finally got their first from a defensive lineman in a win against Kentucky last week. That's potentially welcome news for Auburn, which is dead last in the nation in sacks allowed per game (4.20).\nAuburn's SEC struggles: Since Hugh Freeze took over in 2023, the Tigers own the fifth-worst SEC win percentage (.278). Slow starts have been a pattern: Auburn dropped its first four conference games over the past two seasons under Freeze and is already 0-2 in SEC play in 2025. Ten of those 13 SEC losses came against opponents ranked in the AP Top 25.Key matchup: Saturday's game might come down to which offense can best establish the run. Both Auburn and Georgia have held opponents to under 90 rushing yards per game this season, ranking among the top 20 nationally. The Bulldogs hold a slight edge, posting a 53.7% success rate on designed run plays compared with 47.6% for Auburn's offense.Georgia vs. Auburn prediction, picks  \nWith how unpredictable college football has been this season, and neither Auburn nor Georgia's offenses -- led by Jackson Arnold and Gunner Stockton, respectively -- being particularly imposing, it might be best to lean toward the total. The two SEC rivals are a combined 3-7 ATS this year, and recent history in the Deep South's Oldest Rivalry backs that up, with nine of the last 12 meetings finishing under the total. Pick: Under

    "body": "\n        Week 6's London showdown between the Denver Broncos (3-2) and the New York Jets (0-5) features two squads headed opposite directions. The Broncos are riding high after handing the Super Bowl LIX champion Philadelphia Eagles their first loss of the 2025 season in a 21-17 stunner in Philadelphia. Denver trailed 17-3 and then ripped off 18 consecutive points for just the franchise's second road win ever when trailing by at least 14 points. Quarterback Bo Nix locked in during the final quarter, completing 9 of his 10 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. Bet Broncos vs. Jets at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365. Claim your offer here:On the other hand, the Aaron Glenn-led Jets are still searching for their first win. In fact, Glenn is the first head coach to start his tenure 0-5 in team history. A critical reason for that is because Glenn's is the first without a takeaway in the first five games of a season since at least 1940, per CBS Sports Research. That's another reason why exactly half (56 of 112) of the Jets' points have come when trailing by 13 or more points this season. It's the most scored when trailing by at least 13 points by any team through five games in the play-by-play era, since 1991, according to CBS Sports Research. The Jets have plenty of work to do across the pond. \nWhere to watch Broncos vs. Jets liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 9:30 a.m. ETWhere: Tottenham Hotspur Stadium (London)TV: NFL Network | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Broncos -7.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel Sportsbook)Broncos vs. Jets: Need to knowCan Broncos quarterback Bo Nix find consistency against the New York Jets defense? Denver's 3-2 record is representative of the topsy turvy nature of quarterback Bo Nix's 2025 season: he's thrown for eight touchdowns, tied for the ninth-most in the NFL, and committed five turnovers (four interceptions and one fumble lost), tied for the sixth-most in the NFL. His performance in the Broncos' Week 5 victory at the Eagles was a microcosm of his inconsistency with Denver scoring just three points in the first three quarters before piling on 18 points in the fourth quarter.Bo Nix, Week 5 at EaglesFirst Three QuartersFourth QuarterTeam Points318Comp/Att15/29 (51.7%)9/10 (90%)Pass Yards115127Pass Yards/Attempt4.012.7TD-INT0-01-0Passer Rating61.7152.1Fortunately for the Broncos and Nix, the Jets have the second-weakest pass rush in the NFL with a quarterback pressure rate of only 26.4%. Only the Carolina Panthers with a 25.6% quarterback pressure rate are worse. That should give Nix plenty of time to play efficient, turnover free football. Will the NFL's leakiest offensive line (Jets) be able to hold up against the NFL's best pass rush (Broncos)? Jets quarterback Justin Fields is being protected by the worst offensive line in football: New York has allowed an NFL-worst 50% quarterback pressure rate and an NFL-worst 95 quarterback pressures. That's tremendously bad news for Fields since he'll be going up against Broncos edge rusher Nik Bonitto, who co-leads the NFL with 7.0 sacks along with New York Giants edge rusher Brian Burns, and a Denver pass rush that collectively leads the NFL in sacks (21) and quarterback pressures (89). This matchup between the Broncos defensive line and the Jets offensive line when Fields drops back to pass is the NFL equivalent of the hydrogen bomb vs. coughing baby meme. Broncos Defense NFL Ranks, 2025 SeasonNFL RankPPG Allowed16.82ndTotal YPG Allowed288.65thSacks211stQB Pressures891stQB Pressure Rate44.7%2ndPasser Rating Allowed83.37thBroncos vs. Jets prediction\nYes, Jets quarterback Justin Fields is off to a historic statistical start to his 2025 season as the first player in NFL history with at least 750 yards passing (754), 200 yards rushing (204) and no interceptions through four games played in a season. However, much of that is empty stats because half of New York's points have been scored when trailing by at least 13 points. Fields has also never won a start (0-26) when an opponent scores at least 21 points because of his inability to prevail in an aerial fireworks show. With all the time Nix will have when dropping back to pass, Denver will surpass 21 points, which will allow its pass rush to eat en route to a multiscore victory. Prediction: Broncos 24, Jets 10 | Broncos -7.5, Under 43.5\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Florida got back on the right track last Saturday in Week 6, snapping a three-game losing streak with a 29-21 win over Texas. Its next opponent also hails from the Lone Star State, and the hostile confines of Kyle Field could make life more challenging on Billy Napier and his Gators than it was during the much-needed win at home. If this new momentum is to last more than one week, the Gators have to get past No. 5 Texas A&M on the road.That is no easy feat. The Aggies are 4-0 at home including two consecutive SEC victories. Mike Elko has Texas A&M playing terrific offense, and the defense finally held up its end of the bargain in those two conference wins by allowing a combined 19 points to Auburn and Mississippi State.Bet Texas A&M vs. Florida at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Napier has not been one to string together big wins throughout his much-maligned Florida tenure. His struggles at taking Florida to the next level could help Texas A&M bolster what is quickly shaping up to be a potential College Football Playoff-caliber resume. As for his hot seat status, which is the primary topic surrounding the Gators program on a near weekly basis, another loss would almost certainly rekindle questions just one game after he bolstered his job security.\nWhere to watch Florida vs. Texas A&M liveDate: Saturday, Oct. 11 | Time: 7 p.m. ETLocation: Kyle Field -- College Station, TexasTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Florida vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  Gators in a gauntlet: Schedules do not get much tougher than the one Florida faces this season. This game also marks the final week of a brutal stretch in which the Gators face four top-10 opponents in consecutive outings. They went 1-2 against No. 3 LSU, No. 4 Miami and No. 9 Texas, so to add another victory against the Aggies to improve to .500 in that stretch would be respectable if not impressive, all things considered. Florida is not done with premier competition after this week, though. Two more top-10 foes (No. 10 Georgia and No. 4 Ole Miss) loom in November.Boom or bust: The Marcel Reed experience is a roller coaster. He is a rare case in that he ranks No. 7 nationally in yards per completion (14.6) but No. 98 in completion rate (59.7%). Reed brings a dynamic element to the Texas A&M offense and has the eighth-best odds, per FanDuel, to win the Heisman Trophy. But throughout his starting tenure which dates back to last season, when things go poorly, they have a tendency to spiral. Fortunately for Reed, Florida's pass rush is far from the most formidable, so he could have ample time to operate and avoid costly errors.\nFlorida offense shows signs of life: Scoring 29 points on the elite Texas defense is impressive regardless of the context. What made it particularly surprising in Florida's case was that the Gators had yet to score more than 16 points against an FBS opponent heading into that win. DJ Lagway looked healthier and more comfortable leading the offense with his most productive passing effort of the year, Jadan Baugh ran for more yards (107) on the Longhorns than on any other opponent this season and freshman receiver Dallas Wilson made a splashy college football debut with six catches for 111 yards and two touchdowns.  Florida vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  \nBanking on Lagway to perform in a tough environment is asking a lot. He threw five interceptions at LSU and managed just 61 yards at Miami. Elko, defensive coordinator Jay Bateman and the 12th Man are more than capable of making life difficult on him in a similar fashion even with Wilson breaking out as a potential game-changer in the Gators' receiving corps. On the flip side, Florida boasts the best defense Texas A&M has seen all year. The threat of a defensive touchdown always looms, and 47.5 is not a very large number, but I have a hard time believing these offenses will put the ball in the end zone seven times.

    "body": "\n        The Week 7 college football schedule features top 25 matchups throughout the day into the night, leading into a primetime schedule with some of the biggest programs in the nation. Two of the marquee names in college football are in the early stages of their conference rivalry, with USC and Michigan going head-to-head with their combined 19 national championships. Michigan defeated USC, 27-24, in Ann Arbor last season in their first matchup as Big Ten rivals in the programs' first meeting since 2007. Although Michigan travels to USC for their matchup this year, the SportsLine model expects a similar result, as it has Michigan defeating USC at +120 odds as one of its Saturday best bets at DraftKings on the Week 7 college football schedule.While the model likes USC to pull off the upset, it's also backing a pair of favorites in its Saturday best bets at DraftKings. The model projects Georgia to cover its 4-point spread against Auburn, as it has in the programs' previous eight meetings, as well as Minnesota to cover as 7.5-point favorites against Purdue in its Saturday best bets.

Georgia has the No. 16 scoring offense at 36.3 points per game, and ranks 36th in defensive scoring at 21.5 ppg allowed. The Bulldogs have dominated the last decade against Auburn, winning eight straight games by at least seven points. They are also 11-1 over their last 12 meetings, with each of their victories coming by at least six points. Auburn has lost both of its SEC games this season, and that's a trend the model expects to continue on Saturday. The model projects Georgia to cover in 60% of simulations.Michigan +124 vs. USCThe Wolverines bested USC, 27-24, in their first meeting as new Big Ten rivals last season at home, and the model likes their chances of delivering the same result on the West Coast. Michigan, ranked No. 15 in the nation, is coming off a 24-10 win over Wisconsin last week to improve to 4-1. USC (4-1) lost, 34-32, to Illinois on Sept. 27 in its previous matchup before a bye last week. The Wolverines are led by a stout defense yet again, ranking 16th in the nation in scoring defense (16.2 ppg allowed) after having a top-20 scoring defense in the country in each of the prior four seasons as well. USC has the No. 1 scoring offense in the nation at 48.4 points per game, but that's inflated by scoring 73 points against Missouri State and 59 points at Georgia Southern. USC hasn't played a defense ranked in the top 85 in the nation yet this season, so Michigan will be a completely different test for the Trojans. The model projects Michigan to win in 58% of simulations, despite being the underdogs at DraftKings.Minnesota -7.5 vs. Purdue (-108)The Golden Gophers are coming off a rough showing, but playing the No. 1 team in the nation can do that. Minnesota lost on the road to No. 1 Ohio State, 42-3, last week. They'll return home to play Purdue, and the Golden Gophers are 3-0 on their home field this season. Purdue is 2-3 this season, despite playing four of five games at home, and the Boilermakers lost their one road contest, 56-30 to No. 24 Notre Dame. Minnesota has won six of its last seven home contests against Purdue, with four of those victories coming by more than seven points. The model projects Minnesota to cover in 64% of simulations. Want more college football picks for Saturday?You've seen the model's Saturday best bets.

    "body": "\n        DALLAS -- Texas quarterback Arch Manning has been saddled with immense expectations from the first time he arrived on campus, from No. 1 recruit to preseason Heisman favorite.But playing in one of the nation's signature rivalries against No. 6 Oklahoma, he dominated by excelling with the details. Manning's final stat line was relatively pedestrian -- 21-of-27 for 166 yards and a touchdown. But unlike the first few weeks, where Manning was asked to drop bombs downfield, his playmaking ability in the intermediate range was put to the test. Playing against an Oklahoma defense that ranks No. 1 in the nation in several categories, the Longhorns knew that Manning would be under duress. The first few weeks, Manning has held onto the ball longer than almost any other quarterback in the Power Four. With potential All-Americans David Stone and R. Mason Thomas on the other side, getting the ball out quick was a priority. \"Arch can make every throw in the book,\" wide receiver DeAndre Moore said. \"It's really about what the defense is giving us. They played a lot of deep coverage and Arch took advantage of that. It was a really great game plan.\" \nManning was pinpoint to start the game, hitting 8-of-9 passes for 52 yards. Many of the passes were screens or slants, but Manning wasn't hitting them early in the year. His accuracy and mechanics looked much improved. Eventually, the pressure did come for Manning. The Sooners posted five tackles for loss over the course of a quarter. Instead of running, Texas coach Steve Sarkisian trusted him to create opportunities. Manning soon started buying time with his legs and finding receivers on intermediate crossing routes to keep drives alive. \"He did a nice job,\" Oklahoma coach Brent Venables said. \"We lost contain a few times to allow him to buy some time. And he's a good player with good skill guys around him. He played with really good poise and made some good plays in tight coverage.\" \nThird down kingTexas was stifled on its first few drives by the Oklahoma defense, especially as a few young offensive linemen struggled to acclimate. But midway through the second quarter, Manning started taking over at a particular moment: third down. \"I think being able to stay out of third and long and get more reasonable third downs,\" Manning said of their success. \"Offensive line did a hell of a job and playmakers made plays. That's what it's all about.\" Looking back at the numbers, though, Manning's mettle was stark. From the middle of the second quarter on, Manning faced 11 times third downs. Those plays averaged a distance to gain of 6.7 yards, an obvious passing situation -- the type Oklahoma's defense feasts on. \nManning was electric in those sequences, completing 8-of-9 passes for 105 yards and adding two carries for 35 yards. The highlight was a 12-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeAndre Moore on third-and-8. His 26-yard scamper ending in a slide was a game-ending play, and he waved goodbye to the crowd. \"He proved today, he's a great quarterback and we're all behind him,\" Livingstone said. \"He's the leader of this team and the leader of this offense.\" The Texas efforts on third down completely transformed the heavyweight battle. The Longhorns strung together drives of 12 plays, 14 plays and 13 plays as they built a 13-6 lead in the fourth quarter. The weight later stacked onto Oklahoma, which allowed a 75-yard punt return to Ryan Niblett that was the closing statement. \n\"I think so much is made about Arch,\" Sarkisian said. \"When we don't win, it's his fault, when we do win, everybody praise Arch. We're the team and Arch will be the first to tell you that. He's an awesome teammate.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sunday is a pivotal game for the Steelers and Browns, though for vastly different reasons. For Pittsburgh, Sunday is a chance to possibly extend its lead over the rest of the field in the AFC North standings. At 3-1, the Steelers will enter Sunday's game with a 1.5-game lead over second-place Bengals. Given that Cincinnati is a 14-point underdog at Green Bay, the Steelers figure to likely emerge from the Week 6 with even greater separation in the division with a win over Cleveland. At 1-4, the Browns need a win if they want to increase their odds of still playing meaningful football by month's end. While their record isn't good, a win could go a long way for the Browns, given the current state of fellow division foes Cincinnati (2-3) and Baltimore (1-4). Records aside, Sunday's game is a matchup of two historic rivals who simply don't like each other. If nothing else, expect a physical game that has become a trademark of AFC North football. \nHere's how you can follow the action in real time, along with a breakdown and a prediction for Sunday. Where to watch Browns vs. Steelers liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 12 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: Acrisure Stadium -- Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Steelers -5.5; O/U 38.5 (via FanDuel)Browns vs. Steelers: Need to know It'll be a road debut for Gabriel. Sunday will be the first regular season road start for Browns rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel. In his first start (which was played in London), the third-round pick had a solid game, going 19 of 33 for 190 yards and two touchdowns in a 21-17 loss to the Vikings. No more Joe. Last year, the Steelers lost to the Colts after Joe Flacco replaced injured starter Anthony Richardson. There's no chance history will repeat itself on Sunday after the Browns traded Flacco to the Bengals earlier this week. \nWhat about Shedeur? If something were to happen to Gabriel, the Browns' quarterback options are rookie Shedeur Sanders and veteran Bailey Zappe, who promoted from the practice squad after Flacco was traded. Sanders has yet to attempt a pass in a regular season game. Zappe does has a win over the Steelers on his resume, a 21-18 victory during the 2023 season as a member of the Patriots. Zappe went 19 for 28 for 240 yards in three touchdowns in that game. A surprising trade. The Browns' second surprise trade when down on Wednesday night when the news broke that they were trading Greg Newsome II and a 2026 sixth-round pick to the Jaguars in exchange for fellow cornerback Tyson Campbell and a 2026 seventh-round pick. Unless Campbell learns the Browns' defense extremely quickly, Newsome's replacement for Sunday will likely be Myles Harden, a 2024 seventh-round pick who has already made three starts this season. Tomlin's dominance facing rookie QBs. Saying that Mike Tomlin's teams have historically played well against rookie quarterbacks would be a massive understatement. Under Tomlin, the Steelers are 26-6 against rookie quarterbacks. Two of those losses, however, were against the Browns, with the most recent loss occurring in 2023 when Dorian Thompson-Robinson led the Browns to an upset win in Cleveland. \nThe rivalry within the rivalry. Sunday's game will feature two of the NFL's best pass rushers in 2017 first-round picks Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt. Their rivalry went to another level the last two years, with Garrett proclaiming himself as the league's premier pass rusher last year after the Browns upset the Steelers in Week 12. Garrett's comments came after Watt posted a passive-aggressive message on social media after Garrett was chosen over him as the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year. Browns vs. Steelers prediction, pick \nTurnovers appear to be the Browns' best chance of pulling off an upset. If the Steelers take care of the ball, minimize Cleveland's rushing attack (led by rookie Quinshon Judkins) and get their own running game going, Pittsburgh should be able to take care of business while getting its first home win of the 2025 season. Pick: Steelers -5.5, Under 38.5\n            ",

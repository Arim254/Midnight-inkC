He took over for Kevin Willard four seasons ago and won 17 games in his first year, 25 games in his second year and then seven games in his third year. Now Seton Hall is 17-7 with a 7-7 record and is looking like a fringy NCAA Tournament bubble team. However, the Pirates are only 7-9 against the spread as favorites this season and Butler is 8-6 against the spread at home. The model predicts that the Bulldogs win outright and cover in 72% of simulations. Back Butler to cover at DraftKings here:Belmont money line vs. Murray State (-102)Casey Alexander has managed at least 20 wins in each of his seven seasons as the head coach at Belmont, but he's still chasing his first NCAA Tournament appearance with the Bruins. Belmont is 23-4 overall this season and can give itself a three-game lead in the Missouri Valley Conference with a win over second-place Murray State (19-8, 11-5) on Sunday night. The model predicts that Belmont wins outright in 58% of simulations. Back Belmont at DraftKings here:Team World to win 2026 NBA All-Star Game tournament (+155)\"The new NBA All-Star format, with three teams competing in a round-robin tournament, should create more fan interest and more on-court intensity. I'll back the World team (+160) to prevail over USA Stripes (+155) and USA Stars (+200),\" Hartstein said. \"Any team (with) Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic (who says he will play a 'little bit' on Sunday) and Victor Wembanyama should be the favorite. While Shai-Gilgeous Alexander and Giannis Antetokounpo won't play due to injuries, the World team supplements its big three with big-time performers like Jamal Murray, Pascal Siakam, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Alperen Sengun. Back Team World at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Sunday?You've seen some of the model's Sunday best bets.

The league has tried to drum up some more interest from fans and players alike to create a more intriguing event. Last year, that plan fell flat with a mini tournament that featured three All-Star teams and one Rising Stars team. This year, the league is still holding the mini tournament but will move to a USA vs. World format. The league wants to highlight the growing international talent, so we'll see Nikola Jokić, Luka Dončić, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and more compete against LeBron James, Kevin Durant and other top American talent. The rosters have already been set, so let's dig into some more details about the new format.\nHow to watch 2026 NBA All-Star GameTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Sunday, Feb. 15Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockNBA All-Star Game format, explainedThe 25 All-Stars have been divided into three teams (Team World has nine players). There will be two U.S. teams (USA Stars and USA Stripes) and one World team. Detroit Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff will coach USA Stars, while San Antonio Spurs coach Mitch Johnson will lead USA Stripes. Toronto Raptors coach Darko Rajaković will coach Team World.There will be a round-robin tournament of four, 12-minute games. USA Stars and Team World will face off in Game 1. The winner of that game will play USA Stripes in Game 2. The losing team of Game 1 will then play USA Stripes in Game 3. Following the three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 with the chance to be crowned champions of All-Star Weekend.If all three teams have a 1-1 record after the first three games, the point differential from the round-robin games will be used to determine the two teams that advance to the championship game.The All-Star Game has a $1.8 million prize pool. Each player on the championship-winning team gets $125,000. Players on the second-place team get $50,000, while players on the third-place team get $25,000.Here are the rosters for the three All-Star rosters:2026 NBA All-Star rostersUSA StarsUSA StripesTeam WorldScottie BarnesJaylen BrownGiannis AntetokounmpoDevin BookerJalen BrunsonDeni AvdijaCade CunninghamStephen Curry (injured)Luka DončićJalen DurenKevin DurantShai Gilgeous-Alexander (injured)Anthony EdwardsBrandon Ingram (injury replacement)Nikola JokićChet HolmgrenLeBron JamesJamal MurrayJalen JohnsonKawhi LeonardAlperen Sengun (injury replacement)Tyrese MaxeyDonovan MitchellPascal SiakamNorman PowellKarl-Anthony TownsVictor Wembanyama\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The 24-hour window to appeal the results of the 2026 Winter Olympics ice dance competition passed, and United States Figure Skating did not appeal the controversial ruling that led to a silver-medal finish for Team USA pair Madison Chock and Evan Bates. A USFS official said to USA Today that the association did not file an inquiry by the Feb. 12 deadline.Chock and Bates finished a mere 0.43 points behind the French team of Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron in the ice dance event, and the judges' scores drew public scrutiny. The American pair trailed narrowly after the rhythm dance portion of the competition, and while five of nine judges awarded them a higher score than the French duo in the free dance, they still came up less than a point short. French judge Jezabel Dabouis gave the French team a score more than seven points higher than Chock and Bates.\"There has been a lot of thoughtful, and at times emotional, discussion about the ice dance competition in Milan,\" USFS CEO Matt Farrell said to USA Today. \"Working together with Madi and Evan after the Games, we will have thoughtful and intentional discussions about the best way to support them and the future of the sport. For now, we plan to join them in supporting the success of U.S. Figure Skating in Milan.\"Dabouis gave Chock and Bates a 129.74-point score for their ice dance routine. She awarded Beaudry and Cizeron 137.45 points. The difference between those marks was the largest of any judge, and the score given to the Americans was the lowest of the judges.\nThat scoring decision raised eyebrows and sparked concerns that Dabouis unfairly favored her home country's team. But the International Skating Union issued a statement defending the judges' decisions.\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations,\" the ISU said, per the Associated Press, adding it has \"full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.\"Chock and Bates earned their first Olympic ice dance medal but were favored to win gold, especially considering they entered the free dance in lockstep with the leaders. They won a gold medal in the team event earlier in the Games. Chock expressed disappointment with the controversial scoring decision that stood between him and a third career Olympic gold medal.\n\"I think it would definitely be helpful if it's more understandable for the viewers to see more transparent judging and understand what's really going on,\" Chock said in an interview with CBS News. \"It's also important for the skaters that the judges be vetted and reviewed and that they are also putting out their best performance. There's a lot on the line for the skaters when they're out there giving it their all. We also deserve to have the judges giving it their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field.\"\n            ",

Auston Matthews' three-point game powered the Americans to victory as they turn their attention to the quarterfinal.Through the first two games, Matthews had drawn criticism for not being at his best. That went out the window on Sunday as Matthews was the best player on the ice for the United States. Matthews really kickstarted the play that got Team USA on the board late in the first period when he retrieved a loose puck in the offensive zone and found defenseman Zach Werenski gliding down the weak side.\nFrom there, Matthews made his presence felt in the offensive zone by getting to the front of the net, scoring both of his goals from in or around the crease. One was a power play goal that deflected in off Matthews' stick, and the other was the redirection of a Jake Sanderson slap pass.The Tkachuk brothers were everywhere, which has become a staple of the American play in this competition. Brady was a physical force and notched an assist on a goal by Brock Faber, and Matthew picked up two more assists as he continues to be at the center of the action offensively.Connor Hellebuyck wasn't tested a lot in goal, but he was very good when called upon. The only shot that got past Hellebuyck came off the stick of Tim Stützle, one of the Germans' two best offensive players.The United States made the preliminary round harder than it needed to be, but the team played its best game of the tournament on Sunday. The Americans will try to carry that momentum into the quarterfinals, where they'll play the winner of Sweden vs. Latvia.\nU.S. men's hockey scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 12: USA 5, Latvia 1Saturday, Feb. 14: USA 6, Denmark 3Sunday, Feb. 15: USA 5, Germany 1QuarterfinalUSA vs. Sweden/Latvia | Wednesday, Feb. 18 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDSemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Friday, Feb. 20 | 3:10 p.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Saturday, Feb. 21 | 2:10 p.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Sunday, Feb. 22 | 8:10 a.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

Five different players found the net for the U.S. against the hosts, with Kendall Coyne doing so twice.The U.S. women's curling team, meanwhile, will look to continue its strong showing in round-robin play against Italy. The U.S. is currently second behind Sweden, with the top four teams advancing to the semifinals.\nAlso, medals will go out in the figure skating pair skate, where two U.S. pairs enter the free skate with work to do to get on the podium after Sunday's short program. \n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics medal count: Keep track of Team USA's quest for gold in Italy\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Milan Cortina Games will run through Sunday, Feb. 22, and in total of 119 events will take place with 245 medals handed out to the athletes.

    "body": "\n        LeBron James is an All Star for a record-extending 22nd consecutive season. Whether or not it's his final one remains TBD. Speaking ahead of Sunday night's All-Star Game, the Los Angeles Lakers superstar remained mum on his basketball-playing future.\"When I know, you guys will know,\" James said about how he's feeling about playing next season. \"I don't know. I have no idea.\"James, 41, is in the final year of a two-year, $104 million deal, the fourth deal he has signed with the Lakers. He's averaging 22.0 points, 7.1 assists and 5.8 rebounds per game this season, with the scoring average on pace to be his lowest since his rookie season (2003-04) when he was still a teenager.James has already missed 18 games this season due to a variety of ailments, meaning he will not be eligible for All-NBA team selection -- there's a 65-game minimum -- which means his 21-year All-NBA streak will end. Still, he has shown moments of dominance, including a triple-double in the Lakers' 124-104 win over the Dallas Mavericks to send the team into the All-Star break.\nIt ended an eventful pre-break stretch for James, who also missed a game with left foot arthritis and, before that, shared a blunt assessment of his team.\"You want me to compare us to them? That's a championship team right there. We're not,\" James told reporters after Monday night's loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. \"We can't sustain energy and effort for 48 minutes, and they can. That's why they won a championship.\"The Lakers (33-21) are fifth in the Western Conference. On one hand, they have a point differential that suggests they should be closer to .500. On the other hand, they've rarely been fully healthy. Luka Dončić has missed 12 games, Austin Reaves has missed 26, and Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart have both missed 10. James acknowledged the health factor Sunday.\n\"It's too hard to really say what we're capable of,\" James said about the team's prospects following the All-Star break. \"I know that we've played some of our best basketball this season, we've looked very good. On the other side, we've been terrible. We've looked disgusting. I think the most important [thing] is if we can get healthy, how many minutes we can be on the floor, how much chemistry with can build with this sprint starting.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe business end of the UEFA Champions League season officially begins this week with first leg ties in the knockout phase playoffs, with Real Madrid and reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain headlining the list of 16 teams competing for eight spots tickets to the round of 16.For Los Blancos, the knockout phase playoffs offer a chance to immediately seek revenge after a surprise 4-2 defeat to Benfica on Matchday 8, one that knocked them out of a top eight finish they looked nearly certain to clinch. It marked an unusual but noticeable hiccup for Madrid since Alvaro Arbeloa took charge following Xabi Alonso's January firing, one that linger in the back of everyone's minds even as they assume their regular position as the favorites in this tie thanks in large part to Kylian Mbappe's scintillating form.Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain make a familiar trek to Monaco as their title defense continues. The reigning champions are naturally the oddsmakers' choice to advance despite a mixed bag in the league phase – four wins out of eight demonstrate that the luster of last season's run to silverware remains but losses to Bayern Munich and Sporting Lisbon, alongside draws against Athletic Club and Newcastle United, prove they are not infallible.Previous Champions League winners Inter will also pass through the knockout phase playoffs in the hopes of advancing, while former finalists Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund are amongst a group that await meetings with the league phase's top eight teams, including Arsenal and Bayern.Here's what you need to know before tuning in.How to watchParamount+ will have every minute of Champions League action this week, while CBS Sports Network and CBS Sports Golazo Network will provide select coverage.

(Those matches will also be simulcast on Paramount+.) The Golazo Show on Paramount+, as usual, will return for the late slate of matches on both days.

It was the England international's first start since December and only his 17th appearance of the season during an injury-plagued first campaign with Madrid, but Alexander-Arnold's return comes with a major boost for Arbeloa and company. Mbappe has been the most consistent attacker in Europe this season with 39 goals across all competitions but Alexander-Arnold offers more range and dynamism for Los Blancos' offense at a very crucial juncture of the season. He's a uniquely creative right back, the best in the world at what he does with an ability to distribute from just about every position on the right flank. His assist on Saturday is merely a precursor for what he can offer Madrid and though he does not solve all of the team's problems (of which there are many), he automatically makes them more of an attacking presence – and harder to beat.Weston McKennie's big season: Juventus are still in the thick of the top four race in Serie A but have a chance to make their deepest Champions League run in four years with a tie against Galatasaray, thanks in large part to Weston McKennie's recent form. The U.S. international is already in the midst of his best goalscoring season ever with seven across all competitions, his performances allowing him to be what Juventus need at exactly the right time. McKennie, who also has four assists this season, has been a utility player for many of his six years with the Turn-based club but has become an out-and-out attacking force since Luciano Spalletti took over as the team's coach last fall. It is a tactical shift that suits McKennie really well and has allowed him to hit another level with a World Cup on home soil just months away, the 27-year-old peaking at just the right time. For a team that's in the middle of the pack in terms of their goalscoring form – Juventus scored 14 in eight league phase matches – McKennie's uptick in form may just be well-timed for them, too, especially against a goal-shy Galatasaray.First-timers target upsets: For Azerbaijan's Qarabag and Norway's Bodo/Glimt, their history-making European campaigns were not reserved solely for the league phase. The pair have reached the knockouts for the first time, Glimt doing so in their first-ever Champions League campaign and less than a year removed from their historic run to the UEFA Europa League semifinals. Naturally, though, things will not get easier from here. Qarabag host Newcastle United, who will travel more than 2,500 miles to Baku for the first leg, the visitors down on their luck in domestic play but still full of quality. Glimt, meanwhile, have quite the uphill battle against Serie A leaders Inter, who continue to seek redemption after their potential treble-winning season unraveled completely a year ago. Big results over the course of the league phase, though, including Qarabag's 2-2 draw with Chelsea and Glimt's 3-1 win over Manchester City, should provide enough confidence for the ambitious underdogs to draw upon as the knockouts approach.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Zuffa Boxing returns on Sunday with Zuffa Boxing 03 from the Meta APEX in Las Vegas. The event is headlined by a clash between Efe Ajagba and former IBF heavyweight champion Charles Martin.Ajagba is on the verge of being a top 10 heavyweight in the world and likely would already be considered as such had things broken better for him on the scorecards in his most recent fight. That night, Ajagba took on Martin Bakole, seen as one of heavyweight's boogeymen, avoided by most in the division for the difficulties he can present to opponents.Ajagba controlled much of that fight in May 2025, but the scorecards resulted in a majority draw, with one judge scoring the fight 96-94 in Ajagba's favor and the other two ruling the fight a 95-95 draw.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 03 live on Sunday night for no additional fee. Plus, every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\nAjagba was rewarded for his performance against Bakole with a proposed IBF title eliminator against Frank Sanchez, who handed Ajagba his lone defeat in a 2021 meeting. Ajagba was unhappy with how the purse bid for the fight shook out and declined to move forward with the bout, ultimately leading to the termination of his contract with Top Rank, which opened the door for the heavyweight contender to sign with Zuffa Boxing.While Martin does hold the distinction of being a former world heavyweight champion, the circumstances of his title reign are unusual.Martin won the IBF title in a 2016 bout with Vyacheslav Glazkov that saw Glazkov unable to continue due to a knee injury suffered during a third-round knockdown. Less than 90 days later, Martin was no longer champion, suffering a second-round knockout to Anthony Joshua.\nMartin has insisted he was \"badly injured\" 10 days before the Joshua fight and continued to chase a rematch for years, rising to the fringes of title contention with a few wins before suffering repeated setbacks in the form of losses to Adam Kownacki, Luis Ortiz and Jared Anderson.After losing to Anderson in July 2023, Martin got back in the win column with a stoppage of unheralded Matthew McKinney the following November. He has not fought since, marking 15 months out of the ring.The light heavyweight co-main event between Umar Dzambekov and Ahmed Elbiali appears to be the standout fight on the card, with unbeaten Dzambekov looking to continue building his resume against a tough out in Elbiali, whose lone loss came to former world champion Jean Pascal.\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of the fight card for Sunday night with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.Zuffa Boxing 03 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookEfe Ajagba -1100 vs. Charles Martin +650, heavyweightsUmar Dzambekov-1400 vs. Ahmed Elbiali +700, light heavyweightsAbel Mejia -800 vs. Jaybrio Pe Benito +500, lightweightsLeonardo Ruiz -1400 vs. Casey Streeter +700, middleweightsAntonio Woods -425 vs. Mark Beuke +300, middleweightsOswaldo Molina -1200 vs. Joshua Clark +650, lightweightsEmiliano Alvarado -2500 vs. Devin Gantt +1000, junior featherweightDariial Kuchmenov -3000 vs. Jorge Lagunas +1000, lightweightsWhere to watch Zuffa Boxing 03Date: Feb. 15 | Location: Meta APEX -- Las VegasPrelims begin at 6 p.m. ETMain card begins at 9 p.m. ETWatch live: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionAs a 31-year-old on a six-fight unbeaten streak who was being lined up for a title eliminator, Ajagba is very much a contender at heavyweight. Martin started his career 23-0 and won a world title, but has fallen very much into a spot as a gatekeeper for the division. That's not a knock because divisions benefit from gatekeepers; they're good enough to fend off pretenders, and a win against them carries actual meaning.\nAjagba came up short against Frank Sanchez, which does raise some questions about whether he is ready to fully break through to the upper echelon of heavyweights and if he isn't, Martin is talented enough to knock him down the ladder. But Ajagba's performance against Bakole showed he can handle big, awkward heavyweights who carry some power in their fists.This is a fight set up to get Ajagba a win over a former champion and he should be able to do just that. Pick: Efe Ajagba via UD\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA All-Star Game has arrived at the Clippers' Intuit Dome in Los Angeles. The game, featuring a brand-new USA vs. World format, is being held Sunday afternoon. The All-Star Game rosters were finalized earlier this week with all injury replacements being named and some of the teams shuffled around. The USA vs. World format features three teams in a round-robin tournament. Twenty-eight players in total were named All-Stars this season as Spurs guard De'Aaron Fox joined the ranks Thursday. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, GiannisThe format will consist of a mini-tournament, where each team plays each other once to determine who will face off in a title game. There will be a USA Stars team and a USA Stripes team to split up the American talent, while Team World will have all the international NBA talent.Some liberties were taken in dividing up the roster to even up the numbers. For instance, Karl-Anthony Towns, who was born in New Jersey but has played for the Dominican Republic national team, will be on Team World, although he also could've been placed on one of the two USA teams. The same goes for Norman Powell, who was slid over to Team World to replace the injured Giannis Antetokounmpo after first being placed on USA Stripes. Powell, born in San Diego, has played for the Jamaican national team. \nAs far as the schedule goes, USA Stars -- made up of the younger American All-Stars like Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham and Tyrese Maxey -- and Team World will face Team World in Game 1. The winner of that matchup will face USA Stripes -- made up of American vets like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard -- in Game 2. The loser of Game 1 will then also play USA Stripes in Game 3. At the end of the first three games, the two teams with the best record will face off in Game 4 to determine the champions.

    "body": "\nThe NBA keeps attempting to find a format for its All-Star Game that will be competitive and spark more interest. It's hoping it found one this time around.A United States vs. World format will be in effect this year when the 2026 NBA All-Star Game takes place Sunday, beginning at 5 p.m. ET at Intuit Arena in Inglewood, Cal. Two teams consisting of American stars and one of international players will compete in a round-robin tournament that features four 12-minute contests.The USA Stripes team will be led by LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Jaylen Brown, while the USA Stars squad features Anthony Edwards, Devin Booker and Tyrese Maxey. Giannis Antetokounmpo was named to the World roster but will not participate due to a calf strain. However, Nikola Jokic and Victor Wembanyama are among the players expected to play for the World team.Sunday's college basketball schedule consists of more than 30 games, including an Atlantic 10 Conference matchup between Davidson (15-9) and Dayton (15-9) at 4 p.m. ET at the University of Dayton Arena. The Wildcats have won three of their last four games, while the Flyers have lost five of six.Another intriguing contest is a MAAC showdown that has Siena (17-9) visiting McCann Arena in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. to take on Marist (16-9) at 2 p.m. ET. Both teams are looking to avoid a third consecutive loss, while the Red Foxes aim to avenge last month's 69-50 loss at Siena. Team World is a +155 favorite to win the NBA All-Star Game tournament in the latest consensus NBA odds. Marist is a 1.5-point favorite against Sienna and Dayton is a 4.5-point favorite against Davidson.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Sunday, Feb. 15. All times EasternNBA best bets, where to watchWorld vs. USA StarsTime: 5 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Cal. | TV: NBC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine pick -- Expert: USA Stars +2.5 (-113, Mike Barner)SportsLine NBA expert Mike Barner has been red-hot as he is 40-17 (+2014) on his last 57 NBA picks. Even though the World team is loaded with size, Barner believes USA Stars can combat that with the likes of Chet Holmgren and Jalen Duren. In addition, he feels USA Stars has the edge in speed, and for that reason, he likes the squad to cover the spread.CBB best bets, where to watchSiena at MaristTime: 2 p.m. | Location: Poughkeepsie, N.Y. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Marist -1.5 (-115) | Expert: Marist -125 (Thomas Casale)The Red Foxes have been superb at home this season, winning 10 of their 12 contests at McCann Arena and nine of the last 10. Each of their home victories were by seven or more points and eight of them were by double digits. The SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see this contest being a blowout, but it does have the Red Foxes covering the spread in 65% of its simulations. SportsLine expert Thomas Casale (30-19, +675 on his last 49 college basketball picks) also believes Marist will emerge victorious as it is the top defensive team in the MAAC.Davidson at DaytonTime: 4 p.m. | Location: Dayton, Ohio | TV: ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 139.5 (-110) | Expert: Davidson +4.5 (-110, Larry Hartstein)Both teams are averaging more than 74 points per game this season, with the Flyers at 76.1 and the Wildcats at 74.5. Davidson has been an offensive juggernaut of late, scoring at least 79 points in each of its last four contests while eclipsing 82 in the past three. The SportsLine Projection Model feels each club will surpass the 70-point mark in this matchup, and its simulations have the Over hitting 71% of the time. SportsLine expert Larry Hartstein (8-1, +690 on his last nine college basketball spread picks involving Davidson) likes the Wildcats to cover the spread as the Flyers are 0-6 ATS in their last six outings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 3 South Carolina picked up a 79-72 win at No. 6 LSU on Saturday night, marking the Gamecocks' 18th straight victory against the Tigers. It was also coach Dawn Staley's 500th win with the program. The win keeps South Carolina (25-2, 11-1 SEC) alone in first place in the conference, while the loss likely ends any chance LSU (22-4, 8-4 SEC) had at earning at No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\"I think this team sees the end of the tunnel, meaning they know we are at the end of the season,\" Staley said during a postgame press conference. \"So it's a little bit easier to just focus in on what we have in front of us, and this was a big one. This was a huge game in front of us, huge game on the road and a hostile environment. Very NCAA Tournament-like. We just found a way to win.\"\nThe last name Johnson stole the spotlight last night as Tessa Johnson scored 21 points and Raven Johnson contributed with 19 in the Gamecocks' victory. Meanwhile, Flau'jae Johnson led LSU's effort with 21 points.As expected, this was a very competitive battle with no double-digit leads for either team at any point in the game. LSU won the first quarter 21-16 but South Carolina entered halftime with a 41-40 advantage. The Tigers played from behind the entire second half, but they got within one point multiple times during the fourth quarter.\nLSU had a chance to tie late in the game with two free throws from Flau'jae, but Staley said her team got \"lucky\" after she missed them both and then the Gamecocks got another opportunity to score. The coach also pointed out how unexpected it was to get the win despite giving up 18 offensive rebounds. \"It was two of the best teams in our conference, in the country, just trying to get a win,\" she said. \"We all said the game is going to be determined in those plays.\"Meanwhile, Kim Mulkey hopes her team takes this loss seriously, but she also likes what she is seeing from a roster that features eight new players and has only lost four games this season.\n\"My assessment would be keep doing what you are doing,\" Mulkey said. \"You are this close to winning some of those games against people you are not supposed to beat. And we did this year, didn't we beat Texas here? We weren't supposed to win that game, so just keep plugging away. Stay in the right mindset and understand it's a lot of basketball left to be played after the regular season is over.\"\n        \n            \n                Women's Bracketology: ACC teams on the bubble, plus mind-boggling stats for each No. 1 seed\n                \n                    Connor Groel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere is a closer look at Saturday's game:Fulwiley faces former teamThis was MiLaysia Fulwiley's first game against South Carolina since transferring to LSU. She had some good moments, including a steal, followed by a no-look pass to Grace Knox in the third quarter.However, it was not an ideal night for her overall. She finished the game going just 1 of 8 from the field with three turnovers in 24 minutes. Her energetic style of play can lift up her team, but sometimes it can also hurt her.\n\"We gotta continue to make the positive be pluses when she's in the ballgame and not minuses because she has tremendous quickness,\" Mulkey said. \"She has things that she just does naturally.\"\n'Who can guard Tessa?'That was the question Mulkey asked her team during a huddle in the middle of the third quarter. It was a valid one because Tessa Johnson went on to register a season-high 21 points, with 16 of those coming in the first half.She was on fire, but LSU freshman Bella Hines deserves credit for how she stepped up to guard her after Mulkey challenged someone to rise to the occasion.\nHines didn't just make an impact on defense, she was also bringing the energy on offense, including four quick points in the third quarter. In the six minutes she played, Hines scored six points and potentially earned herself more playing time.\"I saw a kid that I need to play more,\" Mulkey said. \"She needs to take away some of the minutes of some of them, because she got out there and guarded Tessa. She wasn't afraid to bow up to her. She made shots. She had a lot of energy and effort, and she has my respect.\"\nMadina Okot shines in return to starting lineupStaley took Okot out of the starting lineup before the game against Vanderbilt to take pressure off her. The center returned to the starting five on Saturday and put on one of her best performances of the season with 12 points and 17 rebounds.\nHer impact was especially felt late in the game when LSU was only down by one point and still had a chance to win. After Flau'jae Johnson missed two key free throws, Okot grabbed the defensive rebound and South Carolina called a timeout. With 25 seconds left, Okot snuck behind the LSU defense and converted a pass from Raven Johnson. She also knocked down two late free throws. \"Made probably made the biggest play of the game when Raven gave her a lob in the dunker and she made it. Took her time and made it,\" Staley said during the postgame broadcast interview. \"Truly proud of her because she's been just through somethings this season and hopefully she can gain some confidence from this win.\"\nFlau'jae is not wasting a failureFlau'jae Johnson, who finished the night with a team-high 21 points as well as eight rebounds, was doing everything she could for her team but some shots just didn't go in. She made it a one-point game with a second-chance jumper with 1:16 left in the fourth quarter. The crowd was electric and got even louder when she drew a foul with 45 seconds left. Unfortunately for her team, neither of her two attempts went in. She also missed a 3-pointer with 20 seconds remaining.. \nFlau'jae was emotional after the game thinking about those two free throws and what else she could have done defensively. However, she quoted former Alabama football coach Nick Saban when asked about how she would help the younger players move on from this result and stay locked in for the next game.\"Nick Saban says, 'Never waste a failure,' so we are not going to waste this loss,\" she said. \"We are definitely going to learn from it. We're going to grow from it. As vets, tomorrow or whenever we get back in the lab, we gotta focus. We really gotta be intentional about these last couple of games that we have and then going into the SEC Tournament and the Big Dance.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nearly four months have passed since Dave Dombrowski, the Philadelphia Phillies' president of baseball operations, raised eyebrows with comments he made about first baseman Bryce Harper's 2025 season. Time may yet heal all wounds, but it hasn't stopped reporters from asking Harper about what Dombrowski said, nor has it stopped Harper from admitting he continues to be mystified by it.\"I don't get motivated by that kind of stuff,\" Harper told reporters on Sunday. \"For me, it was kind of wild the whole situation of that happening. I think the big thing for me was, when we first met with this organization, it was, 'Hey, you know, we're always going to keep things in-house, and we expect you to do the same.' And so, you know, when that didn't happen, kind of took me for a run a little bit.\"So I don't know. It's part of it, I guess. It's kind of a wild situation, that even happening. Obviously I didn't have the year I wanted. Obviously I didn't have the postseason I wanted. My numbers weren't where they needed to be. I know that. ...For Dave to come out and say those things, it's kind of wild to me, still.\"\nHarper in 2025 posted his lowest OPS+ since 2019.  In that sense, Harper and Dombrowski would seem to more or less agree, even if they may differ in whether or not it was appropriate for Dombrowski to say the following during an end-of-the-season press conference in October after the Phillies were eliminated by the Dodgers in the NLDS:\"He's still a quality player. He's still an All-Star-caliber player. He didn't have an elite season like he has had in the past. And I guess we only find out if he becomes elite or he continues to be good. If you look around the league, I think ... Freddie Freeman: He's a really good player, right? He still is a good player. Is he elite like he was before? Probably not to the same extent. Freddie is a tremendous player, and that, to me, is Bryce. Can he rise to the next level again? I don't really know that answer. He's the one that will dictate that more than anything else. \"I don't think he's content with the year that he had. And again, it wasn't a bad year. But when you think of Bryce Harper, you think of elite, right? You think of one of the top 10 players in baseball, and I don't think it fit into that category. But again, a very good player. I've seen guys at his age -- again, he's not old -- that level off. Or I've seen guys rise again.\"Again, those are fairly tame comments for an executive to make -- the Chicago White Sox exercising a \"diminshed skills\" clause in Frank Thomas' contract this was not. Dombrowski acknowledges that Harper's numbers were down while leaving open the possibility that Harper rebounds. Harper's issue, then, has to be that his boss (for all intents and purposes) was willing to offer a blunt assessment of his season publicly for no apparent gain other than providing an honest answer to a question. Fair enough.\nHarper, 33, remains under contract with the Phillies through the 2031 season. In the past, the parties have been rumored to have interest in a contract extension. One gets the sense they may want to put those talks on ice until they can finally move past this mess.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        PEORIA, Ariz. —Nick Castellanos has no regrets about how his time in Philadelphia ended. The newly acquired Padre, signed after his release from the Phillies earlier this week, said he took lessons from the rocky finish.But regret? There's none of that. \"In the moment, I felt how I felt, and I spoke from the heart, and I was honest in every word that I said,\" Castellanos said early Sunday afternoon from the Peoria Sports Complex, San Diego's spring training facility. \"It's not like I was outwardly ever displaying that. I kept it all inside. But when I was asked a question, I shot straight, and then people perceived it how they wanted.\" Perception always trailed Castellanos in Philly, making him a polarizing figure across his four seasons with the Phillies. But the dugout incident in June, reported by The Athletic, when he brought a beer into the dugout and screamed at manager Rob Thomson and hitting coach Kevin Long, didn't earn him much support.That, Castellanos admitted, he wished he handled differently.\"I said I will learn from this,\" Castellanos said. I let the emotions get the best of me in the moment. [Going forward] possibly if I see things that frustrate me or I don't believe are conducive to winning. [It's about ] not letting things just pile up over time so when I address it, it's less emotional.\" \nCastellanos joins an emotional clubhouse. Manny Machado, a friend from their childhood days, is viewed as the leader of the club. Some around the game see that fact as part of the reason why San DIego has yet to reach its potential. Whether Castellanos will only add fuel to what is already a combustible clubhouse will be something to monitor this season.Nonetheless, after vetting Castellanos' sour ending in Philly, A.J. Preller, the Padres' president of baseball operations, decided to take a chance on the veteran. \"We did a lot of homework,\" Preller said. \"Throughout the whole offseason, there was a lot of talk that the Phillies were looking to move him. We talked to a ton of people that have history with Nick. Teammates, coaches, people who have been around him.\" \nSan Diego made Castellanos' role clear, indicating he will DH and play some outfield and possibly first base, a position he has never played in his big league career. With the Padres' outfield set by Fernando Tatis Jr. in right, the position Castellanos is most accustomed to, his playing time in the field could be limited. Still, San Diego is paying only the league minimum of his $20 million salary in hopes he can rediscover the bat that eluded him at times with his former club.Machado is confident that Castellanos will produce. \"For me as a player, seeing it from this side of it, I see a guy who's accomplished a lot,\" added Machado. \"I really don't know the details of what happened over there. Don't really care, honestly. I'm just happy we got him for what we got him for, and he's going to improve our team tremendously.\" San Diego is in an unusual position. The club is in the middle of a sale, and its finances have been reshaped by the collapse of its regional sports network model. Preller, known for handing out hefty deals, was uncharacteristically quiet this offseason with the future of ownership in flux. On the field, you could argue the Padres might have missed their window to win a World Series. Machado will turn 34 in July. Xander Bogaerts turned 33 in October. After presuming that San Diego would be Fernando Tatis' longterm home, a trade down the line isn't out of the question. \nTheir rotation this year, too, leaves a lot to be desired headlined by Nick Pivetta, Michael King, and Joe Musgrove. Spring training will determine the final two spots. Castellanos, however, has his sights set on this season. He spoke about needing a fresh start and how he sensed Game 4 of the NLDS would likely be his last game as a Phillie. He long came to terms with that and with some of the decisions he made during the year.He wants to contribute. He believes he can still do so -- even as he enters his age-34 season coming off of a down one (.250/.294/.400 slash line in 547 at-bats).\nHe does have just one regret overall about his previous stop, though. \"That we didn't win a World Series,\" he said. \"I think winning solves everything. So I think the one thing that I wish would have ended up different is that we would have won.\" He'll now try to change that outcome in San Diego.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        No. 22 BYU has won consecutive games for the first time since early January, but Saturday's 90-86 overtime victory over Colorado came at a price. Veteran guard Richie Saunders sustained a season-ending torn ACL in the win, the team announced Sunday.Saunders, the 2024-25 Big 12 Most Improved Player and the 10th-leading scorer in the conference this season, left the contest after just 45 seconds. He fell awkwardly on a drive-and-kick on the Cougars' opening possession and remained on the floor for several minutes as BYU trainers attended to him. Saunders walked into the locker room under his own power and did not return to action.BYU coach Kevin Young did not provide an update on Saunders' status in his postgame media availability and said he was waiting, along with everyone else, to learn about the severity of the injury.\"Unfortunate news last night -- I tore my ACL, ending my season,\" Saunders said in an Instagram post. \"Thank you for all the thoughts and prayers. They mean more than you know. To end my BYU career like this is heartbreaking. I've loved every moment and every challenge that came with representing the school I love. These past four years have shaped who I am -- on and off the court. Cougar Nation, thank you. Through the ups and downs, you've stuck with me. I'll never forget that.\"My story has never been one of ease. And while I didn't plan for this, my career is not over. I will return with more fight and more grit than before. My goals haven't changed. I don't always understand why things happen the way they do, but I trust that God is in the details. I trust His plan. The next chapter begins the same way I've always lived. Work With Faith.\"\nAlong with Texas Tech' JT Toppin, Saunders is one of just two Big 12 players to score more than 1,000 points over the last two campaigns. He averaged a career-best 18.0 points per game across 25 starts this season and was a two-way standout who also tallied 1.7 steals per contest.While BYU still boasts its top two scorers -- AJ Dybantsa leads the nation with 24.4 points per game and Rob Wright III averages 18.7 -- Saunders' absence for the rest of the season could prove devastating to the Cougars' chances of making a deep NCAA Tournament run. They had already fallen out of favor as a Final Four contender after losing four consecutive games against ranked opponents.\"It sucked the life out of the gym, if I'm being honest,\" Young said postgame. \"You never want to see an injury to any player, but definitely to someone who's the heart and soul of our team, bleeds BYU blue. Just didn't like seeing it. Unfortunately, you've gotta move on. You've gotta find a way to come in and channel that emotion.\"\nThe Saunders-less Cougars will have to adjust on the fly against two elite opponents in their next two games. Their first game without the senior guard comes Wednesday at No. 1 Arizona, and they square off against No. 5 Iowa State on Saturday.\n            ",

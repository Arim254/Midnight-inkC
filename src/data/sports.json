But the Retrievers could not overcome 6-of-26 shooting from beyond the arc. At home, I expect the Retrievers to shoot better. They're 5-0 SU (3-2 ATS) in America East home games, including knocking off first-place NJIT 87-74. UMBC does a great job of winning the free-throw battle (outscored conference foes 184-106) and that should prove critical Thursday. Back UMBC to cover at DraftKings here:Knicks (-4.5) vs. Pistons (-105)The veteran Knicks' squad should be well rested following the NBA All-Star break, and they resume the season at home, where New York went 19-9 against the spread heading into the break. The Pistons have a six-game advantage over the Knicks in the standings. However, after losing their first two matchups of the year in Detroit, this is a chance for New York to showcase its Madison Square Garden dominance against the top seed in the East in a potential postseason preview. The Knicks went 10-2 over their final 12 games before the All-Star break, capping it with a 49-point win over the 76ers in the final game.

Thanks to Megan Keller, Team USA defeated rival Canada, 2-1, in a thrilling overtime win for the gold medal.Just over four minutes into the overtime period, Keller deked her way around Canadian Claire Thompson and guided a backhand shot over the right pad of Ann-Renee Desbiens to deliver gold for the Americans.\nIt didn't even look like the game would get to overtime for a while as Canada held a 1-0 lead for the majority of the final two periods. A shorthanded goal from Kristin O'Neill got Canada on the board first, but the U.S. got a clutch play from a legend in the dying moments of regulation.Captain Hilary Knight tied the game with 2:03 left in regulation, a goal that gave her the U.S. women's career records for Olympic goals and points. Knight got to the front of the crease off the face-off, and she tipped a Laila Edwards point shot past Desbiens to even the score.American goaltender Aerin Frankel provided some clutch saves to keep her team within striking distance. Frankel turned away 30 of the 31 Canadian shots she faced, and she had to stand on her head at times when Canada was pressing to extend its lead in the second period.Team USA has now won the gold medal in two of the last three Olympics, and it extends its winning streak against Canada in all international play to eight games.\nU.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0Semifinal\nMonday, Feb. 16: USA 5, Sweden 0Gold medal gameThursday, Feb. 19: USA 2, Canada 1 (OT)\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Hilary Knight has cemented herself as the greatest Olympic scorer in U.S. women's hockey history. And she did it in dramatic fashion. Knight scored the 15th goal of her Olympic career against Canada in Thursday's goal medal game, tying the score at 1-1 with just 2:04 left in regulation and opening the door for her team to win the gold medal on Megan Keller's golden goal in overtime.Knight broke the American women's record for career goals previously held by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. In the process, she also broke the record for most career Olympic points in U.S. women's hockey history. Now at 33 points, she broke the record previously held by Jenny Potter (32 points -- 11 goals, 21 assists). Knight entered the final with 14 goals and 18 assists. \nKnight is already an American hockey icon with no qualifiers needed. From an international perspective, no U.S. player is more decorated than Knight, who won her second gold medal and fifth Olympic medal overall -- another U.S. record. Additionally, Knight is now the third Olympic hockey player in history with five medals to his or her name.Throughout her career, Knight has racked up 12 gold medals and eight silver medals between the Olympics and World Championships. In 115 career games with the U.S., Knight has piled up 81 goals and 70 assists.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics: U.S. women's hockey team finishes incredible run, takes gold with OT win over Canada\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn addition to being a USA Hockey legend, Knight is also one of the greatest players in University of Wisconsin history. In four years with the Badgers, Knight totaled 143 goals, which still stands as the program record for men and women. Knight also led Wisconsin to national championships in 2009 and 2011.In less than three full seasons with the Professional Women's Hockey League, Knight has made her mark there as well. In 2024-25, Knight was tied for the league lead in points with 29 as a member of the Boston Fleet. This season, while captaining the Seattle Torrent in their inaugural season, Knight is tied for sixth in the league with seven assists.\nKnight, 36, doesn't need to add anything else to her resume. Her accolades are already spilling off the page as it is and a place in the Hockey Hall of Fame awaits Knight when her career is over.\n            ",

Megan Keller put home the game-winning goal in the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics gold-medal contest against rival Canada in overtime, placing Team USA on top in a 2-1 thriller on Thursday. Keller made a fantastic move to get past defender Claire Thompson and pushed the puck past Ann-Renée Desbiens for the clinching goal to conclude the women's hockey tournament at the Games. Keller's teammates scrambled to embrace her after she secured Team USA's first gold medal since the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.\nKeller became just the fourth player, woman or man, and first American to score an overtime goal in an Olympic gold-medal game. She joined Canada's Sidney Crosby (2010 vs. USA) and Marie-Philip Poulin (2014 vs. USA) and Russia's Kirill Kaprizov (2018 vs. Germany) as the only players to do so.These Olympics are Keller's third with the national team. The Boston College product, who plays professionally with the PWHL's Boston Fleet, finished the Olympic tournament tied with Team USA's Caroline Harvey as the competition's leading scorer with nine points. Her three goals were the most of any defender in the tournament.\nKeller's clutch goal put the finishing touches on a riveting comeback effort from the Americans, who trailed 1-0 with just over two minutes to play in regulation. Hilary Knight leveled the score with 2:04 on the clock in the third period, setting the stage for a golden-goal situation in overtime. Knight's game-tying goal made her the all-time scoring leader in U.S. Olympic women's hockey history.The United States has medaled at every Olympics since women's hockey became an official sport in 1998. This first-place finish is the third in Team USA history.The victory also improved the United States' record against Canada in Olympic gold-medal games to 3-4. The bordering nations have met in the championship in all but one tournament, and Team USA reigned victorious in two of the last three.\nThursday's match was just the second time in the tournament that the Americans needed more than one goal to win a game. They cruised through the competition with five consecutive shutouts after surrendering one goal in the preliminary round opener. The two goals they scored against Canada were their fewest in a game all Olympics, but both scores will live on in United States hockey lore.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Alysa Liu became the first American woman to win an individual Olympic gold medal in figure skating in 24 years. The 20-year-old Oakland native delivered an electrifying performance during the women's free skate program on Thursday to surge atop the podium.   Liu started the day in third place after posting a 76.59 short program score behind Japan's Ami Nakai and Kaori Sakamoto. As the third-to-last skater of the event, Liu put together a near flawless program while skating to Donna Summer's \"MacArthur Park.\" She received roars from the crowd as she skated with confidence and ease. The positivity exuded off of her with every jump and artistic sequence, culminating with a career-best score of 226.79.\nLiu posted a whopping 150.20 score in the free skate, but had to wait out the programs of Sakamoto and Nakai to learn her fate. However, minor deductions to both Japanese skaters ensured Liu would walk away with gold. Her free skate program was nearly three points higher than the silver medalist, Sakamoto.\"Being able to do it my way on the big stage like this has been my dream,\" Liu said after winning gold, via NBC News. \"I got to do it in my short [program] in the team event and I got to do it tonight in the free skate. I'm just over the moon. I'm the luckiest girl ever, and I'm really grateful.\"   \nLiu finished with a combined score of 226.79, while her American teammates Amber Glenn and Isabeau Levito finished fifth and 12th, respectively. Liu became the first American woman to win an individual gold since Sarah Hughes in 2002 and the eighth American woman overall to accomplish that feat. Earlier in these Games, Liu and Glenn helped the Americans win team gold.NameShort programFree skatingTotal scoreAlysa Liu (USA) 🥇 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t76.59 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t150.20 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t226.79 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tKaori Sakamoto (JPN) 🥈 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t77.23 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t147.67 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t224.90 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAmi Nakai (JPN) 🥉 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t78.71 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t140.45 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t219.16 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMone Chiba (JPN) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t74.00 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t143.88 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t217.88 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAmber Glenn (USA) \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t67.39 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t147.52 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t214.91 \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAt no point during Liu's performance did she appear to be bothered by the pressure. Even after she received her score, it was all smiles.    No shocked reaction, no tears of joy. Just pure happiness.      A remarkable comeback for Alysa Liu   It's the perfect storybook ending for Liu, who briefly -- and abruptly -- retired from figure skating in 2022 at the age of 16. At the time, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of everything from school classes to entire professional sports seasons, Liu's local rink in the Bay Area closed. That provided her something she hadn't had since she started skating at five years old: a break. That forced break from skating made the idea of leaving the sport forever enticing to Liu, and so she walked away.   This wasn't just any figure skater who decided to call it a career. Liu is a prodigy. She began competing in major competitions at the age of 10. By 13, she became the youngest U.S. women's national champion ever. At 14, Liu became the youngest skater to win two senior national titles. In 2019, she became the first U.S. female figure skater to land a quadruple jump in an international competition.   Liu was at the peak of her powers. But she was satisfied with everything she had accomplished at the time, and decided to move on.   \"It was a crucial time in my life,\" Liu told 60 Minutes in an interview before the Olympics began. \"I was 16 and college was coming up. Like, I wanted to do so much. I went to Nepal and I trekked to Everest Base Camp. Me and my friends would do tons of road trips. I was really just livin' it up. I would say it was my best life.\"   \nBut after two years of quality time with friends and family, and traveling around the world, Liu got the itch to compete again. In 2024 she made her triumphant return, and surprised many in her ability to essentially pick right back up where she left things with no skill loss.   If Liu was to return, though, she wanted to do things differently.   \"I get to pick my own program music,\" Liu said. \"I get to help with the creative process of the program. If I feel like I'm skating too much, I'll back down. If I feel like I'm not skating enough I'll ramp it up. No one's gonna starve me or tell me what I can and can't eat.\"   \n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics: American figure skater Alysa Liu is an unconventional talent on an improbable path\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHer coach, Phillip DiGuglielmo, said she returned to the sport a better skater.    \"For many years she was dropped off at the rink,\" DiGuglielmo said. \"She was told what to do. Now she comes in, and it is all collaborative.\"   Since returning in 2024, Liu became a world champion in 2025. That made her the first American woman to win a world title since since Kimmie Meissner in 2006. Liu career has reached new heights in ways she never expected -- she's a gold medalist on the biggest stage. \n            ",

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA has already exceeded its overall medal tally, now at 27, and stands to add to both the overall count and possibly even the gold medal count. A win over Slovakia on Friday would assure the U.S. men's hockey team of some type of medal as it would advance to Sunday's final.On Thursday, figure skater Alysa Liu, 20, became the first American woman to take home a singles gold in 24 years and the U.S. women's hockey team rallied from a 1-0 third period deficit to a 2-1 overtime victory over rival Canada to reach the top of the podium for the first time in eight years. And speedskater Jordan Stolz added to his collection of two previous gold medals with a silver in the men's 1,500 meters.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Entering these Games, Norway had won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag.

    "body": "\n        INDIANAPOLIS -- Will the NCAA Tournament expand in 2027? Maybe, maybe not, but we know we won't have an answer in the immediate future. On Thursday, NCAA senior vice president Dan Gavitt told reporters participating in the mock selection committee exercise that talks on expansion will be paused, with a resolution not coming until after the 2026 NCAA Tournament at the earliest.Earlier on Thursday, NCAA president Charlie Baker neglected to answer an expansion question when asked at the organization's headquarters. Baker met with 10 members of the media and wrapped the informal interview session by reinforcing his opinion: he would prefer to see March Madness expand. \"I think there's some very good reasons to expand the tournament, so I would like to see it expand,\" Baker said. The NCAA's men's and women's basketball committees have been debating and deliberating the concept of expanding their 68-team tournaments for close to four years now. The general public -- and much of the sports media -- stands opposed to the idea of watering down one of the country's most treasured sporting events. \n\"For now, we're still talking to the various players in this one,\" Baker said. \"You have to remember that some of the folks we're talking to are going through some pretty interesting corporate conversations of their own. And I think for us, we accept and acknowledge that, but we're still talking.\"Baker added that, regardless of what decision is made, the NCAA Tournament will remain with its 32-team automatic-qualifier format (which has never been in jeopardy of changing) in addition to the at-large bids that fill up the field. Baker is of the belief that the 36 at-large cutoff is too small for the number of teams that should get a crack on the biggest stage in the sport. \"That leaves 36 spots,\" Baker said. \"That means you're going to leave a bunch of the top 50 teams out of the tournament, right? ... I mean, couple years ago I was kind of bummed when Seton Hall and Indiana State didn't get in the tournament, because they both had quality wins and quality schedules. ... The more you do to create opportunities for the so-called bubble teams each year to get into the tournament, first of all, it puts some other really good teams that probably might belong there. But it also protects the AQs, right? Because I don't want to end up in a situation where people say we need to do something about the AQs because we're keeping too many good teams out of the tournament.\" \nCBS Sports asked Baker how much it would presumably cost the NCAA to add 16 more schools to the men's and women's tournaments. The cost element has been one of the biggest blockades in the past three years to expansion efforts.\"I think we can figure out how to pay for it. I'm not worried about that,\" Baker said. When pressed on the cost in terms of how many millions of dollars the NCAA is projecting to add to its expenses, Baker neglected to give more specifics. He was also asked what his expectation was for the 2027 NCAA Tournament and he declined to go on the record with a prediction. \nIf the NCAA is going to opt to expand for 2027, a decision would need to be made in the spring. This issue has loomed over college basketball for a very long time, which speaks to the logistical challenges at hand, in addition to widespread resistance of changing March Madness.In addition to expansion talk, Baker spoke at length about the challenges of player eligibility and the constant battles the NCAA has been faced with in regard to rosters, NIL regulations and more. He noted the NCAA has a much better track record in court than is often reflected in the media.\"We win a lot more of those cases than we lose,\" he said.The NCAA provided the statistics: Since December of 2024, there have been 56 lawsuits filed in eligibility cases. Thirty of those 56 have seen denials for the plaintiffs and 12 have been granted. There are seven still going at the state court level now and five are pending. A local judge recently ruled against Charles Bediako's case at Alabama, while Trinidad Chambliss recently logged a victory in court to give him a sixth year of eligibility at Mississippi. \nBaker also said the NCAA is having conversations and bracing for the possibility that a few college football players might try to explore options to return to their college teams, should they fail to make NFL rosters at training camps in the summer of 2026.\"It's certainly something we've been talking with folks about it,\" Baker said. \"The basketball piece is just different than the football piece for a whole bunch of reasons, but it's certainly something we're discussing.\"On the topic of eventual collective bargaining, Baker was passionate that it's probably not happening or feasible.\n\"You'd have to get a federal law passed to do that, first of all,\" he said. \"Secondly, student athletes don't want to do that. And third, when everybody says [to collectively bargain] they don't talk about are scholarships now taxable under that arrangement? Does this apply to all the kids in college sports? Because if it does, you can have kids in college sports who are going to have to write checks to their schools to pay for all the benefits they currently get, they don't get taxed on that become benefits that are taxable because they're employees. There's a lot to that issue that nobody ever talks about. ... Saying that is a simple answer to this is not a legitimate response.\" The NCAA has undergone massive changes in the past five years, and Baker has been a proponent for modernizing the 120-year-old organization. For all the progress that has been made with NIL legislation and player empowerment, profound problems still exist and, judging by Baker's comments on Thursday, seem unlikely to be resolved in any major, tangible way in 2026.\"People get paid a lot of money to crystal ball this stuff,\" Baker said. \"It's a hard crystal ball, because so much of it is often driven by outside elements and circumstances, which in some cases are totally unpredictable.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tanking has been the hot button topic around the NBA, and team owners have now gotten in on the conversation. Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia had some strong words on social media about the prospect of teams tanking around the league to better position themselves for one of the top draft prospects coming out of college.\"This is ridiculous! Tanking is losing behavior done by losers,\" Ishbia wrote on X. \"Purposely losing is something nobody should want to be associated with. Embarrassing for the league and for the organizations. And the talk about this as a 'strategy' is ridiculous.\"The topic of tanking was ever-present during All-Star weekend, with league commissioner Adam Silver saying during his annual press conference that the tanking has been \"worse\" this year compared to seasons past. \"Are we seeing behavior that is worse this year than we've seen in recent memory?\" Silver asked rhetorically. \"Yes, in my view. Which is what led to those fines. And not just the fines, but my statement that we're going to be looking more closely at the totality of all the circumstances this season in terms of teams' behavior and very intentionally wanted teams to be on notice.\"\n        \n            \n                Mark Cuban explains why NBA 'should embrace tanking,' prioritize fans in wake of Adam Silver's remarks\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSilver handed down a hefty $500,000 fine to the Utah Jazz for holding out players in the fourth quarter in close games in an effort to lose games. A $100,000 fine was also given to the Indiana Pacers for holding healthy players out of games entirely. \nThe fine given to the Jazz was among the largest we've ever seen, and was clearly supposed to serve as a message to the rest of the league about their tanking tactics. Will it change things? Probably not. But Ishbia thinks \"massive changes\" need to happen to curb this behavior.\"If you are a bad team, you get a good pick,\" Ishbia wrote on social media. \"That makes sense. But purposely shutting down players and purposely losing games is a disgrace and impacts the integrity of whole league.   This is much worse than any prop bet scandal. This is throwing games strategically. Horrible for fans that pay to watch and cheer on their team. And horrible for all the real teams that are competing for playoff spots.\"\"Awful behavior that Adam Silver and the NBA will need to stop with massive changes, and I have complete confidence that with his leadership, he will fix it. Those of us in a position of influence need to speak out… the only \"strategy\" is doing right by fans, players, and the NBA community.\"Ishbia didn't offer any options for what should be done to stop this blatant tanking, but his thoughts are in direct opposition to what Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban thinks on the topic. Cuban also took to social media recently to say that the NBA should \"embrace tanking,\" as it's one of the proven ways for teams to improve their championship hopes. That's especially true of small market teams -- like the Jazz -- who will never be able to outpace teams like the Los Angeles Lakers or New York Knicks in trying to sign top-tier free agents simply because the team exists in Utah and not a market like Los Angeles or New York.We'll see if the league tries to make any meaningful changes to limit tanking, but it's been an unsolvable problem for years now. And in a year where the draft is loaded with elite talent, of course every team is going to prioritize their draft positioning over getting the No. 8 spot in the playoffs just to get swept. It's a situation the league created by awarding the worst team with the top pick in the past and then flattening the odds to allow several teams a more equal shot at landing that top pick.\nSo unless there's drastic, sweeping changes, tanking isn't going anywhere.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Selection Sunday is right around the corner, and NCAA Tournament odds are tightening. While most bettors gravitate toward picking the national champion, targeting teams to make the Final Four can be a smarter strategy. Those wagers pay out after just three wins, and you can spread your bets across multiple teams to increase your chances. Championship bets still have strong appeal, particularly if you're drawn to a longshot or a team peaking at the right time. Combining both types of wagers covers you if a team gets hot and advances, while also putting you in line for the largest payout if they win it all. Below are my favorite \"value\" picks in each market. I left Michigan at -150 to make the Final Four off my list, even though they have the ability to win it all, as you'll see below. Keep an eye out for roster changes -- one major injury can ruin a bet. All odds via DraftKings.  Bet on college basketball at DraftKings, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if their first wager of $5 or more wins:Best value picks to reach the Final FourFlorida Gators (+250)The defending national champions are currently \"on a heater,\" winning 12 of their last 13 games -- most by double-digit margins. Todd Golden has constructed arguably the best frontcourt depth in the country with Alex Condon, Rueben Chinyelu and Thomas Haugh. February is when Florida's momentum traditionally builds. They are currently a top-six KenPom squad, and the addition of transfer Boogie Fland has stabilized a backcourt that previously struggled with turnovers. The Gators are overwhelming -1200 favorites to win the SEC regular-season title, which says a lot about how dominant they've been all year. They have size, depth, and athleticism at every position, and they play with a confidence you can feel. This group is built for a deep March run once again, and I wouldn't bet against them.UConn Huskies (+400)The Huskies look set for a No. 2 seed, but their makeup screams deep tournament run. Even with a few recent losses, UConn's defense is still top-notch, and Dan Hurley has proven he can get a team rolling in March -- just look at those 12 straight covers during their back-to-back title runs. The veteran trio of Alex Karaban, Silas Demary Jr. and Solo Ball gives them experience and leadership. UConn's path through the Big East is also less brutal than what teams in the Big 12 or Big Ten face. At +400, you're really putting your faith in coaching and rebounding -- two things that tend to matter most this time of year. Why not pick them to win it all? Their 69.8% free-throw shooting worries me. Against the best, that's the kind of detail that can end a season.Kansas Jayhawks (+550)A month ago, Kansas struggled with consistency, but Bill Self has refined his rotations to lead the team on an eight-game winning streak. The Jayhawks possess an elite defensive efficiency (Rank 9) and a senior-heavy lineup that brings necessary experience to the tournament. At +550, this is a high-value \"buy low\" opportunity. The Jayhawks' ceiling is contingent on the health of star freshman Darryn Peterson, but they have proven they can win without him, including an upset of previously unbeaten Arizona. If Peterson is fully healthy by March, grabbing 5.5-to-1 odds on a Bill Self-coached team to win three games feels like tremendous value.Saint Louis Billikens (+2800)If you're looking for a big return on a small bet, Saint Louis is the ultimate Cinderella candidate. Led by Robbie Avila -- nicknamed \"Larry Nerd\" -- the team holds the 23rd spot in KenPom and boasts an offense that hits threes at a 40% rate while dominating at the rim. The path won't be easy for this mid-major, but they excel in the mid-range, protect the ball, and rarely make costly mistakes. At +2800, picking Saint Louis is a bold move that could shake up the tournament. I called them a dark horse on the Early Edge, and I stand by it. With odds like these, it's worth a shot -- especially since we haven't seen a true dark horse make a deep run in quite some time.Pick any of these teams to reach the Final Four at FanDuel, where new users can get $100 in bonus bets if their first bet of $5 or more wins:Top value picks to win national championshipMichigan Wolverines (+320)Michigan has become the standout team of the 2025-26 season, currently sitting atop the NET, RPI, and KenPom rankings. Under Dusty May, the Wolverines lead the nation in scoring margin (+22.5) and have posted a flawless 10-0 record in Quad 1 games. Michigan's impressive size and relentless pace present a challenge for any opponent across a full 40 minutes. Yaxel Lendeborg spearheads a Wolverines transition offense that relentlessly pushes the pace and averages 90.6 points per game.As the consensus pick for the No. 1 overall seed, Michigan is well positioned for the smoothest route to Indianapolis. I would be surprised if they don't reach the Final Four, and the +320 odds to win the championship offer solid value.Florida Gators (+1300)The Florida Gators enter the final stretch of the season as one of the most compelling value plays on the board at +1300. As the reigning national champions, Todd Golden's squad has demonstrated the talent and tactical depth required to become the first back-to-back winners since UConn's 2023-24 run. By betting Florida at +1300 now, you are securing a premium price on a team that ranks as a top-five unit in advanced efficiency since the start of conference play and possesses the most physical frontcourt in the tournament field. This line will not last much longer, so get down ASAP.Illinois Fighting Illini (+1300)I love the value this team offers at its current odds. The main reason to back the Illini is their historically efficient offense. Illinois owns the nation's top adjusted offensive efficiency rating, according to both KenPom and Bart Torvik. Averaging 84.8 points per game, they deploy a system that wears down opponents with up-tempo transition play and elite floor spacing. Even in their losses -- including two in overtime -- the games have been close. Illinois features a remarkable mix of freshman talent that has consistently exceeded expectations. Consistency on defense has been Illinois' only major flaw this season. However, the return of senior guard Kylan Boswell from a fractured hand has fundamentally changed the team's defensive profile. In his first game back, Boswell spearheaded an elite defensive effort that held Indiana to just 40.8% shooting and 25% from the 3-point line. Since his return, Illinois has jumped to No. 23 nationally in defensive efficiency, creating the balanced \"top 25 offense/top 25 defense\" profile that historically characterizes national champions. By betting on Illinois at +1300 now, you are securing value on a team that currently possesses the best offense in college basketball and is just now reaching full defensive health at the perfect time for a March run. While Illinois is also available at +250 to make the Final Four, this current wager offers superior value.Bet on the college basketball national championship futures at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users can get a first bet match up to $250 in bonus bets with promo code CBSSPORTS250BM:\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Racism continues to overshadow the world of soccer, and the next couple of weeks may be telling as to how things will be handled moving forward. Ahead of Real Madrid and Benfica meeting at the Santiago Bernabeu on Feb. 25 in the UEFA Champions League playoffs second leg, there's a matter that needs to be sorted out due to a current UEFA investigation into an incident between Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior and Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni from Tuesday. An alleged racial incident caused the match to be stopped while the referee reviewed what happened, and it has now been moved to an investigation by UEFA to determine the next steps. Both teams are maintaining that their side of the story is the correct one, and here's what to know so far:What happened?After Vinicius Junior scored the winning goal in Real Madrid's 1-0 victory over Benfica in the playoff first leg, the match had to come to a stop due to alleged racial abuse. As he does many times when he scores, Vinicius went to the corner flag to celebrate while dancing, for which he was yellow carded, while objects from the stands also rained down onto the pitch. Benfica weren't happy with this, and Argentine winger Gianluca Prestianni raised his shirt to cover his mouth while speaking to the Brazilian.While it's officially unknown what Prestianni said, he was alleged to have called Vinicius a 'mono' which is the Spanish word for monkey. Vinicius reported the incident to referee Francois Letexier, who paused the match while sorting out the situation as per UEFA's three-step procedure for referees to act against incidents where racism is believed to have taken place.Since it wasn't clear what was said by Prestianni, the referee could only investigate the matter before deciding on a course of appropriate action, which in this case was resuming the match, but the incident is still subject to further investigation once the match is complete.\nUEFA released a statement calling for that investigation, which so far, Real Madrid has complied with:\"A UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector has been appointed to investigate allegations of discriminatory behaviour during the UEFA Champions League 2025/2026 knock-out play-off match between SL Benfica and Real Madrid CF on 17 February 2026.Further information regarding this matter will be made available in due course,\" the statement read.What's Real Madrid saying?In a statement on Thursday, Real Madrid confirmed that they submitted all the evidence that they have to comply with UEFA's investigation.\n\"Real Madrid C. F. announces that today it has submitted all available evidence to UEFA regarding the incidents that occurred last Tuesday, February 17, during the Champions League match our team played in Lisbon against SL Benfica. Our club has actively collaborated with the investigation opened by UEFA following the unacceptable episodes of racism experienced during that match.Real Madrid appreciates the unanimous support, backing, and affection that our player Vinicius Jr. has received from all areas of the global football community. Real Madrid will continue working, in collaboration with all institutions, to eradicate racism, violence, and hate in sports and society.\"What are Benfica saying?Benfica are supporting Prestianni's statement that what Vinicius said he heard was not what was actually said. There has yet to be an update of their compliance with the investigation, but with the two teams meeting next Wednesday to decide the tie, this is on a compressed timeline.\"The Club reaffirms, clearly and unequivocally, its historical and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality , respect , and inclusion , which align with the core values of its foundation and which have Eusébio as their greatest symbol.Sport Lisboa e Benfica reiterates that it fully supports and believes in the version presented by the player Gianluca Prestianni , whose conduct while serving the Club has always been guided by respect for opponents, institutions, and the principles that define Benfica's identity. The Club regrets the defamation campaign to which the player has been subjected.\"\n            ",

Ball was not injured in the two-car crash, which came at an intersection downtown and totaled his vehicle.Video obtained by WSOC-TV showed Ball's vehicle making contact on the driver's side with a KIA sedan shortly before 5 p.m. Wednesday. The front left tire of Ball's Hummer came off of the vehicle during the accident before the GMC came to a stop near the shoulder.Ball was later spotted at the scene being picked up in a Lamborghini shortly after the accident. Both cars involved in the wreck were reportedly towed from the scene, but an accident report has not been made available.\nThe Hornets have won 10 of their last 11 games with Ball leading the charge. The sixth-year pro and former No. 3 overall pick is averaging 19.3 points per game and 7.4 assists this season.Charlotte (26-29) is currently the No. 9 seed in the Eastern Conference standings, 3.5 games back of Miami. The Hornets' starting lineup of Ball, standout rookie Kon Kneuppel, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges and Moussa Diabate has the franchise in line to make its first postseason appearance since the 2015-16 season if the hot streak continues.\nEarlier this month against the Rockets, Ball led the Hornets with 20 points during a road victory, which marked Charlotte's eighth straight win -- the first time that's happened since the 1999-00 season.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        On a day at Riviera Country Club that featured everything from a deluge of rain to a 3-hour weather delay to wind gusts hovering around 30 miles per hour, a man who has done just about everything in the game of golf rose to the top of the leaderboard. Rory McIlroy was nearly flawless in the first round of the 2026 Genesis Invitational, shooting his lowest-ever score across the first 18 holes at Riviera with a 5-under 66 to sit one stroke behind Aaron Rai.Round 1 was suspended due to darkness with the likes of world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele and Jordan Spieth all needing to complete the majority of their back nines on Friday when play resumes at 7 a.m. PT.Scheffler will take the interruption in stride as he was 5 over through 10 holes, 11 strokes off the lead and tied for last place when play was called. It's the third straight week in which the best player in the game has slipped out of the gate.McIlroy, meanwhile, was among the first players on the golf course; as such, he was able to finish his first round. He now looks to do what neither tournament host Tiger Woods nor legend Jack Nicklaus accomplished in their careers: win at the historic venue that is Riviera. On the line is not only the trophy and a signature event purse but the five-time major champion reaching the 30-win mark on the PGA Tour.\n\"I've definitely got more comfortable playing in conditions like this over the past few years as I've gotten more comfortable in controlling my ball flight, and controlling my ball flight taking a lot more club, hitting the ball low,\" McIlroy said. \"I've started to just really enjoy this style of golf. \"If you had asked me 10 years ago, I didn't enjoy these conditions, but it's been a shift in a mindset and maybe just a continuation of trying to build upon the skill set that I have. Then, when it does get to conditions like this, I'm a lot more prepared. I wouldn't say I enjoy them, but I can certainly handle them better.\"If McIlroy plays the next 54 holes in the same manner as his first 18, he will win this tournament. Battling and overcoming the conditions, he played golf in its truest essence -- flighting drives depending on the wind direction, leaving himself with easy leaves and taking care of the scoring holes.\nAttacking the early portions of both nines, McIlroy started his round emphatically, making birdie on three of his first four holes to propel himself to the top of the leaderboard. His birdie on the newly lengthened par-3 4th came right out of the rain delay as his first stroke produced a 30-foot birdie.\nOnce the rain subsided, wind entered the equation, and McIlroy answered masterfully. Showing off every tool in his belt, the 36-year-old headlined his grouping that featured another round in the 60s from Tommy Fleetwood -- the Englishman has broken 70 in 20 straight PGA Tour rounds -- and a nifty 68 from last week's winner Collin Morikawa. \"Just trying to keep the same mindset essentially,\" Morikawa said. \"You don't want to get too relaxed, but you also want to kind of find that zone to go out and play golf. A long day, a lot of back and forth kind of rain, no rain, a lot of wind, no wind. Just was able to get the ball in the hole, which was kind of the whole goal.\"\nLeader1. Aaron Rai (-6): Known as a Point A to Point B type of player, Rai kept everything in front of him on Thursday, and he was rewarded with a stellar performance on the greens. The Englishman opened with an eagle, tacked on six more birdies and made putts from nearly 80 feet on No. 9, 7 feet on No. 11, 21 feet on No. 13, 12 feet on No. 15 and finally 7 feet on No. 16. He will have a chance to extend his lead Friday morning as he starts his day on the par-5 17th.ContendersT2. Rory McIlroy, Jacob Bridgeman (-5)4. Ryan Fox (-4)T5. Pierceson Coody, Akshay Bhatia, Collin Morikawa, Aldrich Potgieter, Max Greyserman, Si Woo Kim, Marco Penge (-3)T12. Jhonattan Vegas, Taylor Pendrith, Maverick McNealy, Viktor Hovland, Hideki Matsuyama, Tommy Fleetwood, Ryo Hisatsune, Harry Hall (-2)Only two weeks into his PGA Tour season, and Hovland is already searching for answers with his driver. He may have found them on Thursday. Missing only two fairways, the Norwegian looked noticeably more comfortable with the big stick in hand and was sensational from tee to green. He will need to clean up his play on and around the green as all three bogeys were courtesy of some sloppy play in that area, but if his full swing is in order, he should love his placement.\n\"You might have seen the band drill that I was messing around with now. It's still trying to serve the same purpose, but I feel like that actually made it easier for me to find something tangible that I could take out on the golf course,\" Hovland said. \"Trying to just get a little bit wider in the downswing, not trying to pull my arms as close to me. That's what the floaties were for, trying to get some space in the downswing. It was just hard to feel that when I took the floaties away. \"But the band, because it forces your body to push against the tension, and then when you take it away, it's like, 'Wow, that's what it's supposed to feel like.' We're not quite all there yet, even though this is a great round of golf, but that was a huge step in the right direction.\"\nScheffler's Thursday struggles continueIt was an inauspicious start from the world No. 1 on the first hole as Scheffler found the surface on the easy par 5 only to need three putts and walk off the green with a par. That ultimately told the tale of his day as Scheffler never made it easy on himself.\nWith two bogeys in his first six holes, he started to head even further south on the leaderboard when he made a head-scratching double bogey on No. 8, which featured another three-putt. He turned in 4 over, made an ugly bogey on the devilish, short par-4 10th and made par on another scoring chance on the par-5 11th to put a bow on his day.Like the last three weeks, Scheffler faces a long climb back, and unlike last week, he will be staring the cutline directly in the face as the top 50 players and ties (as well as those within 10 strokes of the leader) will secure tee times over the weekend.2026 Genesis Invitational updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookRory McIlroy: +350Aaron Rai: 10-1Si Woo Kim: 13-1Jacob Bridgeman: 15-1Collin Morikawa: 15-1Tommy Fleetwood: 18-1Hideki Matsuyama: 19-1Scheffler is at 26-1, if that tickles your fancy, but instead, we will look at someone else on the golf course with holes remaining in his first round: Matt Fitzpatrick at 36-1. The Englishman is 1 under, through 15 holes and will have a couple of scoring chances coming in Friday morning. He made nothing on the greens Thursday, so if his fortunes change, he will make up some ground.\n            ",

    "body": "\nMike Wagner, a former Pro Bowl defensive back and a key member of the Pittsburgh Steelers' famed \"Steel Curtain\" defense, has died at the age of 76 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.Wagner spent his entire 10-year career with the Steelers. Over that span, he was named to two Pro Bowls and helped Pittsburgh win four Super Bowls over a six-year span. He was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor in 2020. \"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Mike Wagner, a tremendous player and an integral part of some of the most successful teams in Pittsburgh Steelers history,\" said team president Art Rooney II. \"As a member of four Super Bowl-winning teams, his toughness and consistency were paramount to our secondary. His contributions on the field were significant, but it was also his steady presence and team-first mentality that truly defined him.\" An 11th round pick in the 1971 NFL Draft, Wagner was part of a notable Pittsburgh draft class that also included future Hall of Fame linebacker Jack Ham and fellow future starters in defensive linemen Ernie Holmes and Dwight White, offensive lineman Gerry Mullins, tight end/offensive lineman Larry Brown and receiver Frank Lewis. Despite his low draft stock, Wagner cracked the Steelers' lineup as a rookie and a year later finished second on the team with six interceptions. A year later, he led the entire NFL with eight interceptions. In 1974, Wagner helped the Steelers win the franchise's first Super Bowl, recording one of Pittsburgh's three interceptions during Pittsburgh's 16-6 win over the Minnesota Vikings. A year later, he was named to his first of two consecutive Pro Bowls while helping Pittsburgh repeat as champions. His fourth quarter interception of Roger Staubach in Super Bowl X set up a field goal and helped the Steelers record a 21-17 win over the Cowboys. Wagner's interception of Staubach was nothing short of brilliant. Prior to the snap, he realized that the Cowboys were about to run their bread and butter play that had resulted in the game's first touchdown. At the snap, Wagner instinctively positioned himself right in front of Staubach's pass intended for Drew Pearson. \n\"Mike was our quarterback in the secondary,\" Hall of Fame cornerback Mel Blount said, via the team's website. \"When you think about all the great players we had on that team who flew under the radar, Mike was one of those guys. I don't know if the fans or the general public really knew what an intricate part of that defense he was. He directed what we were doing back in the secondary, and at the same time made plays himself. He made some big plays for us. He did his job and made sure we were doing ours.\"More importantly with Mike, you're talking about a good human being. He was just a good person.\"In 1976, Wagner was one of a staggering eight Steelers defenders who were selected to the Pro Bowl. That season, Pittsburgh's defense recorded five shoutouts and allowed just 28 points over a nine-game span. Wagner remained a key component of the Steelers' defense when they won two more Super Bowls to close out the decade. In 1978, he filled the stat sheet with two interceptions, three forced fumbles and two sacks as Pittsburgh finished the season by defeating the Cowboys in the Super Bowl for a second time. In 1979, Wagner recorded four interceptions despite only playing in eight regular season games. The Steelers finished that season with a 31-19 win over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV. He retired after the 1980 season with 36 career interceptions, 12 fumble recoveries and five sacks. \"He will always be remembered as a champion,\" Rooney said, \"a great teammate, and a proud member of the Steelers family.\" \n            ",

Jackson has missed the last two games due to a hamstring injury suffered vs. the Kansas City Chiefs, but the two-time league MVP was a full participant in practice on Friday after being limited Wednesday and Thursday.The 1-5 Ravens have lost four straight games, and were out-scored by a combined 48 points in the last two losses to the Houston Texans and Los Angeles Rams, in which Cooper Rush started at quarterback. John Harbaugh actually announced Friday that if Jackson can't go, Tyler Huntley would start vs. Chicago instead of Rush.In his first four starts this season, Jackson completed a career-high 71.6% of his passes for 869 yards, 10 touchdowns and one interception. As a rusher, he picked up 166 yards on the ground and another touchdown. Jackson is averaging a career-low 41.5 rushing yards per game this season. \nThe Bears are no pushover, as Ben Johnson's squad has won four straight games and leads the NFL in takeaways (16) and turnover margin (+11). The Ravens are 4-11 without Jackson under center since 2019, which was his first season as Baltimore's full-time starter. He is 24-3 against the NFC in his career, which is the highest win percentage by a quarterback in non-conference games since the merger. \n            \n    ",

However, in his second start since being acquired from the Cleveland Browns, new quarterback Joe Flacco led the Bengals to an impressive 33-31 win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 7. Flacco threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns, while star receiver Ja'Marr Chase hauled in 16 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown.On the other hand, the Jets have had a brutal start to the 2025 season as they remain winless at 0-7. Most recently, New York racked up just 220 yards of total offense in a 13-6 loss against the Carolina Panthers last week. After a subpar first half, coach Aaron Glenn elected to bench offseason signee Justin Fields in favor of veteran Tyrod Taylor. It's unclear which quarterback will be under center on Sunday.Click here to bet Jets vs. Bengals at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nWhere to watch Jets vs. Bengals liveDate: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: Paycor Stadium -- Cincinnati, OhioTV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bengals -6.5; O/U 44.5 (via FanDuel)Jets vs. Bengals: Need to knowFlacco continuing to get more comfortable. For most of Burrow's absence, Cincinnati has been lackluster at the quarterback position under backup Jake Browning. However, Flacco now has two games under his belt with his new team. Obviously, Flacco looked much more comfortable in picking up a win against the Steelers last week. The veteran signal caller has plenty of weapons, especially at the wide receiver position. It also doesn't hurt that the Jets are surrendering the seventh-most points (26.1) in the NFL and don't get a ton of pressure on the quarterback.Jets' offensive struggles. A great deal of New York's early shortcomings have been as a result of their offense. The Jets are averaging the fourth-fewest yards per contest (271.3), while scoring just 17 total points in their last two games. Fields and Taylor split first-team reps throughout the week and Glenn has yet to announce which quarterback will get the start on Sunday. No matter who is under center, the Jets likely will want to get star running back Breece Hall involved early on, whether it's on the ground or out of the backfield.Get Brown going. Entering Week 8, the Bengals rank last in the NFL in rushing with just 68.9 yards per contest. Starter Chase Brown had struggled to begin the season, but produced his best outing of the season with 108 rushing yards against the Steelers last week. With the Jets being in the bottom half when it comes to defending the run, Brown could enjoy more of that same success in this week's matchup.Jets vs. Bengals pick, prediction\nThe Jets are a sinking ship right now. It's unclear which quarterback will be under center against the Bengals, but it may not matter at this point. The Bengals offense seems to be finding itself with Flacco at the helm. As a result, Cincinnati certainly has all the makings of a team that comes out with a convincing win this week. Pick: Bengals -6.5; Under 44.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        If the Los Angeles Dodgers are to become the first back-to-back World Series champions since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees, they will have to go through the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays punched their ticket to the Fall Classic with a Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners on Monday night as George Springer hit a game-winning home run. This is Toronto's first World Series appearance since 1993, when they won their second consecutive title.The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series. They are the first defending champion to reach the World Series the next season since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies, and, in more than a few ways, this year's Dodgers are better than last year's. On the mound, Tyler Glasnow is L.A.'s worst starter, and he's pretty darn good. Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and the singular Shohei Ohtani have all pitched like aces the last few weeks and they're all healthy. Ohtani also provides impact at the plate, as evidenced by his historic three-home run performance in the pennant-clinching NLCS Game 4 win. Snell will receive the nod in Game 1, with Yamamoto following him in Game 2. That was the same order the Dodgers employed during the NLCS.\nAs for the Blue Jays, they've ridden a high-powered offense to seven wins in 11 postseason games. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has been the best hitter on the planet this month and is doing just about everything he can to bring a championship to Toronto. Others like George Springer, Ernie Clement, and Andrés Giménez have come up big at times this postseason as well. Toronto's pitching staff is neither as deep nor as star-studded as L.A.'s, but it is formidable. Rookie righty Trey Yesavage, who gets the Game 1 start, has shown himself to be unfazed by postseason pressure and veteran starters Shane Bieber, Kevin Gausman, and Max Scherzer have proven their postseason chops. The bullpen can be shaky, though the same is true of the Dodgers. The Blue Jays (94-68) will be the home team over the Dodgers (93-69) in the World Series because they had the better regular-season record. Here now is the schedule for the 2025 World Series.

Additionally, the Dodgers are, by far, the more experienced club in this setting. Los Angeles will have now appeared in five of the last nine World Series, including three of the past six.Blue Jays: The Blue Jays are in their first World Series since 1993, when they won their second title in a row. Toronto became just the third club in the last 20 years to overcome a 2-0 deficit in a best-of-seven series, with the others being the Arizona Diamondbacks (in 2023) and the Dodgers (in 2020).Game 1 predictionI picked Los Angeles to win the whole thing heading into the postseason, and I have to stand by that now. The Dodgers were the better team during the regular season, in terms of run differential, even if they had the worse record. Most importantly, the Dodgers now have a healthy rotation. I think that'll prove to be the difference, starting with a tight victory here in Game 1. I'll say 3-2 Dodgers. -- R.J. Anderson\n            ",

England, the 2025 UEFA Women's Euro winners, will host Brazil, the 2025 Copa America Femenina champions. The match is the first meeting between the two sides since 2023. The Lionesses came out victorious in the \"Finalissima\" after a 4-2 penalty shootout against Brazil.Saturday's game is just an international meeting during the official October window, and will be a glimpse into two of the world's best sides. Fans can watch the upcoming match on CBS Sports Golazo Network and Paramount+.Both squads are missing key players ahead of the game, and both head coaches will want to utilize the game as an important checkpoint in building up to the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. Lionesses head coach Sarina Wiegman and Brazil manager Arthur Elias will have to balance tactical efforts and creative flair as they continue to evaluate their player pool, before they meet again for the 2026 Finalissima.Here's everything to know ahead of the gameHow to watchDate: Saturday, Oct. 25 | Time: 12:30 p.m.Place: Etihad Stadium -- Manchester, EnglandStream: CBS Sports Golazo NetworkLionessesEngland is fresh off their historic back-to-back championship. The 2025 Euro winners find themselves in a bit of a new era in a build-up to the 2027 World Cup. The team is without general retired stalwarts in Mary Earps and Fan Kirby, but showed during the Euros that they can manage. The recent retirement of Millie Bright is another to consider, but there are injuries at play that may affect some roster rotations for manager Sarina Wiegman during this international window.\n\"It is great that we can return to action after our incredible summer with four exciting fixtures at home. Each opponent will challenge us in different ways, which is exactly what we need with World Cup qualification beginning early next year,\" Wiegman said in a statement\"It's very nice to begin against Brazil, and it is also special for us to be able to play again for our fans in Manchester for the first time since EURO 2022. We know from the Finalissima in 2023 that they will be very tough opponents.\"Leah Williamson, Lauren James and Lauren Hemp are long-term injury absentees. Jess Park, Grace Clinton and Katie Reid withdrew from the squad with injuries and were replaced by Jessica Naz and Grace Fisk.\nGoalkeeper Hannah Hampton has very recently withdrawn after an elbow injury. She's been replaced by Brighton & Hove Albion keeper Sophie Baggaley.BrazilBrazil is also managing an injury load. Manager Arthur Elias is without Real Madrid's Antônia and Manchester City's Kerolin. He has also lost Atlético Madrid's Gio Garbelini following an injury during UEFA Women's Champions League play, and her replacement, Kansas City Current's Debinha. São Paulo's 22-year-old forward Isabelle Caroline has been called up and could be another attacking option for his staff.\"These games are really important for us to see how we behave collectively when facing different teams with different styles,\" he said at the squad announcement. \"We are at a stage where we are consolidating our team identity.\"\n'We will face two great European teams. England, two-time Euro Cup champion, and Italy was a semifinalist and playing very well,\" Elias said about the international window. \"The list was planned according to this evolution that we have been making in the selection. With opportunities for young players, we have an average age of 24 years, which we consider close to ideal, thinking ahead to the 2027 World Cup.\"PredictionWith so much uncertainty around rotations and lineups, this could have the script of another draw between the two sides. Unlike the 2024 Finalissima, there won't be penalties to decide a winner, but England might squeak out a win with the home crowd behind them.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 season has been a historic one for Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who is on the precipice of possibly making even more history when Pittsburgh hosts his former team -- the Packers -- on Sunday night. Rodgers, who earlier this season passed former teammate Brett Favre in career touchdown passes and former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger in career passing yards, will become only the fifth quarterback in history to beat all 32 NFL teams if he can defeat the Packers in a matchup between two first-place clubs. \n        \n            \n                Steelers' Aaron Rodgers says he will end his career 'with Green Bay' ahead of Sunday's showdown vs. Packers\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe four-time league MVP will become the fifth Hall of Fame-caliber quarterback to face his former longtime team. Ironically, one of the previous quarterbacks to do so was Favre when the Vikings faced Rodgers' Packers during the 2009-10 seasons. Joe Montana, one of Rodgers' childhood idols, also faced his longtime former employer during his second (and ultimately final) season with the Chiefs.  For the most part, the previous four quarterbacks had successful first games against their former longtime team. Their teams were 3-1 in those games, which included Favre's first win over the Packers during the 2009 season. \nNotable QBs vs. former longtime team Joe Montana, 1994 Montana went 19 of 31 for 203 yards and two touchdowns in leading the Chiefs to a 24-17 win over the 49ers in Week 2 of the 1994 season. Montana outdueled his former teammate, Steve Young, who committed three turnovers and was sacked four times. \nYoung would rebound from that loss by leading the 49ers to their first Super Bowl title since 1989. In the process, Young won his second league MVP in three years and was also named Super Bowl MVP after throwing six touchdown passes against the Chargers while breaking Montana's previous Super Bowl single-game touchdown pass mark. Brett Favre, 2009 Favre ripped the Packers' defense to shreds in Week 4 of the 2009 season. In front of a primetime audience, Favre went 24 of 31 for 271 yards and three touchdowns while accumulating a 135.3 passer rating in Minnesota's 30-23 win. \nWhile Favre received sterling protection (he wasn't sacked), Rodgers was sacked eight times, with Hall of Fame pass rusher Jared Allen being responsible for 4.5 of those sacks. But despite the constant pressure, Rodgers still managed to throw for 384 yards and a pair of touchdowns. It was a similar story a month later when Favre made his first and only appearance at Lambeau Field with the visiting team. He threw four touchdown passes with no picks while leading the Vikings to a 38-26 win. Minnesota's offensive line, once again, did not allow a sack of Favre, while the Vikings' pass rush, once again, got to Rodgers, who was sacked a half dozen times. Rodgers still held his own by throwing three touchdowns. Favre won his first and only game at Lambeau Field as the opposing quarterback.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Green Bay flipped the script in 2010, sweeping the Vikings in what turned out to be the final year of Favre's illustrious career. The 2010 season ended with the Packers' win over the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. \nPeyton Manning, 2013Manning had an emotional return to Indianapolis in Week 7 of what was his second season as the Broncos' quarterback. In a high-scoring game, the Colts recorded a 39-33 win while handing Manning's Broncos their first loss of the season. While both Manning and Andrew Luck threw three touchdown passes, neither one was very accurate on a day when emotions were high. Manning was especially off, as he threw 20 incompletions, was sacked for a safety and threw a pick that set up a Colts field goal. Manning acknowledges the crowd prior to his first game against the Colts.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Manning's misery against his former team continued in 2014, when the Colts shocked the heavily favored Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs. That loss largely overshadowed Manning's lone win over his former team, which came in Week 1. \nIn 2015, Manning faced his former team one last time in Week 9, with the Colts once again coming out on top in a tightly-contested game. Manning would finish the season -- and his career -- on a high note, though, after he and the Broncos defeated the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. Tom Brady, 2021 Brady's only game against the Patriots came on the heels of his seventh Super Bowl win and his first without his longtime coach, Bill Belichick. As he often did, Brady led the Buccaneers on a game-winning drive that included a key third-down completion to Antonio Brown. Tampa Bay's 19-17 win included 269 yards from Brady on just 22 of 43 passing. \nBrady played OK, but the Buccaneers' top offensive player that night was running back Leonard Fournette, who ran for 92 yards and also caught three passes for 47 yards. Brady was all business against his former team  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            On Sunday night, Rodgers will become the latest Hall of Fame-caliber quarterback to face his longtime former team. And while he has acknowledged that this won't be just any other game, Rodgers has also made it clear that he has no hard feelings towards the Packers, a team with which he enjoyed tremendous success during their 18 years together. \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" he said this week. \"I have a lot of great memories from my time there. There have been a lot of great interactions with fans over the years. You know, living in Green Bay, living in Suamico, living in Hobart, going to Chives, being out and about, seeing people at the Piggly Wiggly when I'm shopping for groceries.\n\"I grew up there. I spent 18 years there, from [age] 21 to 39. So I'm thankful for my time there.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Nick Saban has been out of the coaching industry for nearly two years, and it appears he will not return to the college football sideline in the immediate future. Coaching searches are underway at numerous Power Four programs and more could be on the way, but Saban said again that he has no interest in accepting any potential job offers at this point in his retirement.That is a disappointing development for anyone at Florida, Penn State or any other school holding out hope that Saban could be on the market. Those prominent programs figure to offer hefty salaries to attract the best and brightest candidates on the coaching carousel, but not even the prospect of a massive payday piques Saban's interest.\"I want to stay retired, and I do not want him (agent Jimmy Sexton) anywhere near Miss Terry, because when she hears some of these numbers, she gets interested,\" Saban said on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"And I ain't interested.\"If ever there was an opportunity for Saban to pick up a clipboard and headset again, the 2025 hiring cycle would be among the best. Multiple traditional powerhouse programs fired coaches early in the season, and more prominent positions could open in the coming weeks with all eyes on Wisconsin, Auburn and other schools where high expectations have not equaled reality in recent years.\nSaban would, in theory, have his pick of whichever open job he would like if he were to return to coaching. The seven-time national champion and College Football Hall of Fame electee is one of the greatest football coaches of all time at any level and would inject enthusiasm into any program that hires him.But two seasons into his gig as a college football analyst, Saban says he is perfectly content.\"No way,\" Saban said about the possibility of accepting a job offer. \"I have so much fun working with you. Why would I go do that?\"\nFlorida, Penn State, Arkansas, Oklahoma State, Virginia Tech, UCLA and Stanford comprise the list of seven Power Four programs to fire their coaches thus far in the 2025 season. Four additional programs at the Group of Six level are in search of new leadership, as well. This cycle already features more power conference openings than last year's, and the season is only just over halfway complete. The 2024 carousel saw movement at only five Power Four schools.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        It's important to attack the waiver wire early in the season. Picking up the correct players within the first week or two can provide you with excellent returns for the duration of the season. With that in mind, here are six players who are still available in the majority of CBS leagues to consider adding.Jaylen Wells, Memphis Grizzlies (49% available)Cheating a little bit on this one because Wells is rostered in just over half of leagues. However, it's worth checking to see if he is still on the waiver wire in yours. He started the Grizzlies' season opener against the Pelicans, scoring 14 points over 28 minutes. He took all eight of his shots from behind the arc, making four of them. In addition to his scoring contributions, Wells chipped in three rebounds, four assists, and one steal.Last season, Wells averaged 1.7 3-pointers over just 26 minutes per game. With Desmond Bane being traded to the Magic during the offseason, the Grizzlies need more 3-point shooting. Wells has the potential to play a lot this season and could really help fantasy managers in need of a boost in points and three-pointers.Ryan Kalkbrenner, Charlotte Hornets (60% available)Mark Williams had a checkered injury history, but he was still an important part of the Hornets last season. The team then traded him to the Suns, creating a huge void at center. They did not bring in a significant veteran to replace him, instead turning to second-round rookie Ryan Kalkbrenner to start their season opener against the Nets. He certainly made a good impression with his new squad, posting 10 points, 11 rebounds, and two blocks across 27 minutes.\nIt's not always going to be as easy as a matchup against the lowly Nets. However, it was encouraging to see Kalkbrenner start and play so many minutes in his first game. Moussa Diabete logged 21 minutes off the bench, while Mason Plumlee didn't take the floor at all. Kalkbrenner blocked shots in bunches in college, so if he starts for the duration of the season, he could provide significant fantasy value. For those who need a center, he should be the top waiver wire target.Neemias Queta, Boston Celtics (65% available)The Celtics moved on from Kristaps Porzingis and Al Horford during the offseason. As they tried to get their payroll in order, they didn't make any significant additions up front. Queta drew the start in their first game, logging 25 minutes against the 76ers before fouling out. He shot 7-for-8 from the field, finishing with 17 points and eight rebounds.No big off the Celtics' bench logged more than 16 minutes against the 76ers. Even starting power forward Sam Hauser played just 22 minutes. The Celtics are desperately lacking size, so given how well he performed in the first game, Queta may have a leg up on Chris Boucher, Xavier Tillman Sr., and Luka Garza for minutes moving forward.\nJaime Jaquez Jr., Miami Heat (76% available)Jaquez showed promise during his rookie season, averaging 11.9 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists, and one steal over 28 minutes per game. He also shot 48.9% from the field and 81.1% from the free-throw line. Still, the Heat only played him 21 minutes per game last season, which mostly made him irrelevant in most fantasy leagues.Jaquez didn't start in the Heat's first game of the season against the Magic, but he logged 30 minutes off the bench. That helped him produce 13 points, six rebounds, and two steals. He showed efficient shooting again, making six of his seven attempts from the field. The Heat's depth is being tested with Tyler Herro (ankle) likely out through at least November, so don't be surprised if Jaquez continues to play a lot off the bench.Tre Jones, Chicago Bulls (83% available)Just before the start of the regular season, the Bulls announced that Coby White is out with a calf injury. The initial report said that he wouldn't even be re-evaluated for two weeks, so it's possible that he could be out even longer than that. With him out, Jones started their season opener against the Pistons. He logged 32 minutes, finishing with 12 points, eight assists, three steals, and one three-pointer.\nJones has shown he can be productive when given added playing time. During a nine-game stretch as a starter in March of last season, he averaged 14.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, 7.1 assists, 1.2 steals, and 0.9 3-pointers. He'll likely be relegated to a limited role once White returns, but until then, he's worth rostering in many fantasy formats.Ron Holland, Detroit Pistons (87% available)Holland only averaged 16 minutes per game during his rookie season, which limited him to averages of 6.4 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 0.6 steals. The Pistons' roster looks different heading into this season, with Malik Beasley no longer in the picture and Jaden Ivey (knee) out for at least a month. Even Tim Hardaway Jr. departed the team to join the Nuggets.Duncan Robinson and Caris LeVert were brought in to help offset the offseason losses for the Pistons, but Holland also looks to be primed for more minutes. In what was a great matchup against an up-tempo Bulls team in the Pistons' season opener, Holland played 27 minutes. He came through with 19 points, four rebounds, three assists, two steals, one block, and one three-pointer. The Pistons need scoring within their second unit, so Holland could be in line for a large role this season.\n            ",

And sure enough, adversity has now struck a Tampa Bay Buccaneers team that was seemingly rolling right along.After racing out to a 5-1 start and looking like a team that had a claim to being one of the outright best in the NFC, the Buccaneers were handed a humbling 24-9 defeat by the Detroit Lions in Week 7, one which featured the loss of one of their best players and a pillar of their franchise. It was a bad loss at a bad time, as the Bucs now enter their second NFC South game of the year with a trip down to the Superdome to play the New Orleans Saints -- a team which, despite their 1-6 record, has continued to prove to be a tough out.\nWhere to watch Buccaneers vs. Saints liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 4:05 p.m.Where: Caesars Superdome -- New Orleans, LouisianaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Buccaneers -4.5; O/U 46.5 (via DraftKings)Buccaneers vs. Saints: Need to knowThe effect of losing Mike Evans. What made Tampa Bay's loss to Detroit especially devastating was that on top of losing the game, they also lost All-Pro wide receiver Mike Evans to a broken collarbone that will sideline him for a majority of the rest of the season. The injury not only deprives the Buccaneers of one of their best players on offense, but also brings an end to a remarkable streak of production and durability: Evans had 11 consecutive 1,000 yard receiving seasons since entering the league, tying an NFL record held by Jerry Rice, and he had also played in at least 13 games in all of his seasons to date. With Evans now out long-term, more of the passing game shall not only fall on promising rookie receiver Emeka Egbuka, but also key reserves including Sterling Shepard and Tez Johnson.More losses for the Saints. The sting of New Orleans' latest loss to the Chicago Bears was exacerbated by developments on the injury front, as the team saw center Erik McCoy (biceps) and running back Kendre Miller (ACL) both be lost for the remainder of the season. McCoy's injury is especially devastating, as the two-time Pro Bowl player has been the Saints' starter since being taken in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft. Miller, a third round pick in 2023, had also been emerging and showing promise in his third season. The loss of Miller will open the door for sixth-round rookie Devin Neal, who took over Miller's role in the backfield as well as kick returner against the Bears. Buccaneers vs. Saints prediction, pick\nThe Buccaneers are favored in this matchup by -4.5, which seems about right given how the Saints -- for all that they lack as an overall team -- have continually proven they can at least hang around and make things difficult for their opponent from week to week. Still, Tampa Bay has long proven to be a thorn in New Orleans' side. The Saints were the first team that the expansion Buccaneers ever beat, and Tampa Bay has gone 5-1 in their last six matchups with New Orleans. I would expect the Bucs to bounce back here, even if the Saints make them play four full quarters to earn it.

But for this upstart Carolina team, the grade is getting much steeper. Not only because it is dealing with an injury at quarterback, but because it's about to face its toughest test yet as reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills come to Bank of America Stadium. The Panthers' hopes of becoming a playoff team will be put to the test.\nWhere to watch Panthers vs. Bills liveWhen: Sunday, Oct. 26 | Time: 1 p.m. ETWhere: Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North CarolinaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Bills -7.5; O/U 45.5 (via DraftKings)Panthers vs. Bills: Need to knowThe return of the Red Rifle? The Panthers' win last week came at a cost, as quarterback Bryce Young was forced to leave the game and is now described as \"day-to-day\" with what has been reported as a high ankle sprain. Young did not participate in practice on Wednesday, but he was seen working out on the side and -- most notably -- was not seen in a walking boot. Should Young be unable to play, veteran backup Andy Dalton would get his first start of the season after filling in for Young from the third quarter on a week ago. The famed \"Red Rifle\" did just enough to keep the Panthers afloat against the Jets, completing four of seven passes for 60 yards while taking one sack. The Panthers are 1-5 in games that Dalton has had to start since 2023, with his lone win coming in a 36-22 drumming of the Raiders a year ago.Old faces in familiar places. For the first time since becoming the coach of the Bills, former Panthers defensive coordinator Sean McDermott will lead his team into Bank of America Stadium as the visiting coach in a regular season game. McDermott coached in Carolina from 2011 to 2016 under franchise great Ron Rivera, leaving his mark by overseeing defenses that helped lead the Panthers to three NFC South titles in a row before a 15-1 record and trip to Super Bowl 50 in 2015. Many figures from that great Panthers team later built the Bills into what they've become, including general manager Brandon Beane, the former assistant GM in Carolina. Among the notable former Panthers players now on the Bills includes linebacker Shaq Thompson, the Panthers' first round pick in 2015 who became the understudy to Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis before carrying the baton all the way until 2024.Panthers vs. Bills prediction, pick\nAs an upstart team that's new to the winner's circle, the Panthers are still in a position where they have to earn the trust of Vegas, as the bookies have hedged their bets and made the Bills a -7.5 point favorite in this game. Carolina has gone undefeated at home in uptown Charlotte this year, but their chances in this game have taken a considerable hit due to the injury to Bryce Young as well as their rushing attack coming back down to Earth a week ago. Still, the Panthers are playing very well on defense -- Derrick Brown has been arguably the best defensive tackle in football this season -- which will at least give them a chance against a Bills team that had lost two straight prior to their bye. The Bills may bounce back in this matchup, but they and all other teams in the NFL will quickly find out that the Panthers are no longer a doormat.

    "body": "\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have a storied history of postseason success, and they begin their quest Friday for their third World Series title of this decade and ninth in franchise history.Conversely, the Toronto Blue Jays have had a limited sample size on baseball's biggest stage but made the most of its opportunities, winning titles in each of its two appearances.The teams square off in Game 1 of the 2025 World Series in Toronto, with first pitch from Rogers Centre set for 8 p.m. ET Friday. The Dodgers are seeking a second consecutive World Series title in the best-of-seven series. They're already the first World Series champions to make a return appearance since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies. The last franchise to win back-to-back World Series was the New York Yankees, who hit the trifecta from 1998-2000.Coincidentally, the Blue Jays won back-to-back World Series in their only prior appearances, in 1992-93. Should they win their third, they would remain tied with the Miami Marlins as the only undefeated franchises with multiple World Series appearances. Rookie right-hander Trey Yesavage (2-1, 4.20 ERA) is scheduled to start Game 1 for Toronto, while the Dodgers are leaning on two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell (3-0, 0.86). Los Angeles is a -155 favorite (risk $155 to win $100), while Toronto is priced at +130 in the latest sportsbook odds for Dodgers vs. Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series. The over/under for total runs scored is 7.5. In addition to Game 1 of the World Series, we'll preview an NBA showdown and a late college football kickoff in the Mountain West Conference. The following is a snapshot of what to watch for Friday, Oct. 24. All times Eastern. MLB best bets today, where to watchDodgers at Blue Jays Time: 8 p.m. | Location: Toronto | TV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Blue Jays +1.5, -130 | Expert: Under 7.5 runs (Bruce Marshall) The SportsLine Projection model sees some slight value in the underdog Blue Jays winning outright but prefers taking the insurance run for added value and laying the modest price to do so. Its 10,000-game simulation suggests Toronto will keep this a one-score game about 63% of the time, a stark contrast to the implied sportsbook odds of around 56%. SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall (+2940 on MLB picks this season) locked in a strong play on the Under 7.5 runs. He envisions both starters giving their clubs and points out the postseason acumen of Snell, who has an ERA of 0.86 in the playoffs. Marshall also cites the somewhat erratic nature of the Los Angeles offense, figuring into an equation where he projects Game 1 as a low-scoring affair. More MLB best betsModel's best bets for Game 1 of the World Series\nNBA best bets today, where to watchTimberwolves at LakersTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Los Angeles | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Under 225.5 pointsIn this Western Conference playoff rematch, in which the Timberwolves knocked out the favored Lakers, the model has a slight lean on the home underdog Lakers. But its stronger play comes in a top-rated selection on the Under 225.5 points, as the model envisions a modest offensive output relative to the posted total.  The model's 10,000-game simulation projects a final score of 111-109 in Minnesota's favor. Although this score would only send the game Under by five points, the model's data suggests the game stays Under about 60% of the time, a stark contrast to the sportsbook implied odds of about 52%. College football best bets today, where to watchBoise State at NevadaTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Reno | TV: CBS Sports Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 50.5 points This matchup features perennial Mountain West front-runner Boise State taking on a Nevada team that hoped to see positive returns under second-year coach Jeff Choate but instead has been continually plagued by an inability to finish close games and put together strong efforts in consecutive weeks. The high-powered Broncos (5-2, 3-0) were challenged for a while last week against UNLV before creating separation in the second half and rolling to a 56-31 victory. Meanwhile, Nevada (1-6, 0-3) put together a respectable effort but again came up short as a two-touchdown underdog against New Mexico, falling 24-22 for its fifth consecutive defeat. This is a potentially tricky contest for handicapping, as convention wisdom suggests the Broncos, who are three-touchdown favorites, could be a candidate for a sleepy performance against a Wolf Pack club that should play with a sense of desperation to salvage some respectability and perhaps the employment status of its coach. However, the last time Nevada had such an opportunity, it was routed 44-10 by upstart San Diego State in Reno two weeks ago.The SportsLine Projection model evidently sees this dilemma and offers just a moderate lean on the underdog with a projection of a final score that lands close to the posted number. However, it likes the Over 50.5 points with the Broncos leading the way and the Wolf Pack doing just enough to clip the total. Its 39-19 final score prediction sends the game past the total with room to spare, and its 10,000-game simulation sees the Over hitting about 63% of the time.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers in the offseason between the 2023 and 2024 seasons. The Dodgers won the World Series in his first year and he won the National League MVP. He's likely to win the MVP again this year, while the Dodgers head back to the World Series. Standing in the Dodgers' way is the Toronto Blue Jays, a team powered by stars like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and George Springer. But remember when Ohtani was almost (maybe) among them?This was a much much bigger tease job than what we see most of the time when free agents are attached to teams. Sure, there was the normal wine-and-dine atmosphere to the situation. Ohtani visited Dunedin, the Blue Jays' spring training home, and the bidding was serious. People made connections on their own as well, such as the fact that then-Blue Jays starter Yusei Kikuchi and Ohtani attended the same high school in Japan, though that was always thin -- especially since they only overlapped by one year in high school and it's, you know, high school. The roster fit was there, as it was with most teams. The money was there, as it was with a small handful of teams.This is all to say that the Blue Jays had a realistic shot at landing Ohtani, though most people throughout the process always had the Dodgers as the favorites. So what was the tease?  \nThe flurry started on Dec. 8, 2023. Word came down that Ohtani's decision was \"imminent.\" Then the internet sleuths did their thing and started tracking flights. There was a private jet leaving the Anaheim area -- remember, Ohtani was with the Angels before the Dodgers and lived in the region -- and flying to Toronto.The excitement rose. Then, a Twitter account claimed that Kikuchi had rented out an \"entire upscale sushi restaurant near Rogers Centre\" for that night. Oh boy. That's the type of thing that sends some people into a frenzy. Then there were reports that Ohtani was signing with Toronto, though those were quickly shot down by Blue Jays beat reporters. \nNext came reports that Ohtani was indeed flying to Toronto, even if he hadn't officially made up his mind or signed a deal.There was a plane headed from the west coast to Toronto, it turned out. Aboard was not Ohtani, but rather Robert Herjavec, a Canadian businessman and panelist on \"Shark Tank.\"\nThe next day, Ohtani announced he was signing with the Dodgers. Blue Jays nation was heartbroken. Not only were the Blue Jays a finalist for the services of a once-in-a-lifetime player -- and that is probably underselling Ohtani -- but it felt tantalizingly close. If Ohtani signing with another team was a gut punch, Jays fans were also punched in the face and groin.\n\"When we met with him, you felt good about it, and you felt good about the feedback he was giving about our organization and an opportunity here,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Thursday. \"But you never really know what a player's feeling in free agency, and there's a lot of things that have to line up for them personally, too. You can't really think about what if. You think about the 26 that we have.\"He's a great player. I'll say it again, I hope he brought his hat, the Blue Jays hat that he took from us in our meeting, I hope he brought it back finally -- and the jacket for decoy, you know, it's like, give us our stuff back already. But he's a great player. But that aside, I think that we have a great team and just an unbelievable cast of characters and players.

The ALCS MVP was Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who earlier this year signed a 14-year, $500 million extension to stay in Toronto. \nHad the Blue Jays had landed Ohtani in free agency and they were headed to the World Series this year, we'd be saying \"they don't get here without him.\" But they did.

    "body": "\n        What a start to the season. Since the 2025-26 NBA campaign tipped off on Tuesday, we've gotten two double OT thrillers from the Thunder--— including Thursday night's win over the Pacers in Indiana where Shai Gilgeous-Alexander put up a career-high 55 points. It's the first time in NBA history that a team started the season with back-to-back double OT games. For good measure, the Warriors and Nuggets followed that up with another OT classic in Thursday's nightcap. Aaron Gordon posted a career-high 50 points with 10 3s, but the Warriors won after erasing a 14-point deficit thanks in part to Steph Curry scoring 33 of his 42 points after halftime while doing ridiculous Steph stuff. \nWith the Nuggets and Pacers finally getting into the action on Thursday, every team has now played at least once. What follows are the After One Game Awards, a way-too-early collection of honors (some dubious) that we arrived at through the scientific process of watching a lot of basketball -- and in one case reading through two surprising federal indictments. Overwhelmed Commissioner MedalBefore we get to the (mostly) fun stuff we have to address the bomb that detonated on the NBA's opening week when Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones were arrested on Thursday as part of two sweeping federal indictments involving illegal sports betting and gambling. Rozier and Billups were placed on immediate leave by the league, with Portland assistant Tiago Splitter tapped to be the Blazers interim head coach. \nBillups and Jones are accused of allegedly taking part in rigged illegal high-stakes poker games operated by organized crime figures. Jones also is reportedly being accused of selling info about LeBron James and the Lakers before it was public. Rozier is accused of being part of a sports gambling operation that used non-public information about NBA players to their advantage in order to net hundreds of thousands of dollars in bets in what federal law enforcement officials called \"the insider trading saga of the NBA.\" It's worth noting that the Rozier indictment also features someone called \"Co-Conspirator 8\" -- an as-yet-unnamed person whose biography matches that of Billups. The timing here is interesting. Earlier this week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver appeared on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" and called for greater regulation on prop bets.\"We've asked some of our partners to pull back some of the prop bets, especially when they're on two-way players, guys who don't have the same stake in the competition, where it's too easy to manipulate something, which seems otherwise small and inconsequential to the overall score,\" Silver said. \"We're trying to put in place -- learning as we go and working with the betting companies -- some additional control to prevent some of that manipulation.\"\n\n        \n            \n                How can NBA address prop betting problem? Three possible solutions as league faces another gambling scandal\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThat's a starting point, but it doesn't get the league very far. Rozier isn't a two-way player. He's in the final season of a four-year deal worth $96 million. Billups is a Hall of Famer who earned more than $100 million over 17 years as a player, recently signed a contract extension with the Blazers, and reportedly made $4.7 million to coach Portland last season. Those financial profiles don't fit Silver's stated concerns about people associated with the league who might be manipulated into participating in illegal sports betting operations. The league's exposure here on who might be susceptible is bigger than Silver let on during the McAfee interview. Add this to the NBA's ongoing investigation into the Clippers potentially circumventing the salary cap in the Kawhi Leonard saga, and suddenly Silver has a lot of heavy stuff overloading his plate. This is his 12th full year running the NBA and he is tasked with handling two full-blown crises that will undoubtedly linger over this season and define his tenure as commissioner. And with that, we momentarily return to our regularly scheduled basketball nonsense. Best (and only) in Show SashWith LeBron James still on the mend due to sciatica, Luka Dončić was forced to do much of the heavy lifting in an opening night loss to the Warriors at home. He just narrowly missed a monster triple-double, finishing with 43 points, 12 rebounds, 9 assists while shooting 63% from the field (despite going just 2 for 10 from beyond the arc). \nOf course the name of this award necessarily implies the rest of the Lakers weren't great. Outside of Austin Reaves, who got hot late, they were not. The non-Austin/Luka Lakers were a combined 3 for 8 from deep. For a Lakers team that was middle of the pack in 3-point shooting a year ago, that's not encouraging. Depth was a concern for L.A. coming into the season. Part of that is a consequence of design. The plan is to rebuild this thing on the fly around Luka, and to do so the Lakers front office has tried to steer clear of anything resembling long-term commitment. This coming offseason they'll have Doncic, Jared Vanderbilt and Jake LaRavia on the books, along with DeAndre Ayton and Marcus Smart who both have player options that they'll almost certainly pick up. Dalton Knecht, who they tried to ship to NBA Siberia last season in a trade that was eventually nixed, has a club option. Bronny James is partially guaranteed. And Reaves, who they hope to retain, has a player option that he will most definitely decline before signing a much fatter new contract. Everyone else, including and most notably LeBron, will be an unrestricted or restricted free agent. The offseason after next they could potentially say goodbye to everyone outside of Doncic and Reaves. But that long-term flexibility comes with some glaring short-term roster construction issues that head coach JJ Redick will have to solve for this season. It's a strategy that already has our guy Sam Quinn asking questions about general manager Rob Pelinka and the front office. Le Prix AlienI put that through Google translate which assures me it means \"The Alien Award\" in French; I'm sure the AI bot wouldn't lead me wrong. Either way, Victor Wembanyama wasted no time putting the Dallas Mavericks in a stranglehold and the rest of the league on notice with a monster opening night double double: 40 points (15-21 FG), 15 rebounds, one steal and three blocks. He dominated Anthony Davis and had several outrageous dunks, including a reverse alley oop that shouldn't be possible for someone 7-foot-4 or anyone else.\nWebanyama came in at No. 5 in our Top 100 player rankings for this season. I was the highest on him among our staff, ranking him at No. 3. I think I might have been too low. After one game, Wembanyama (at +275) leapfrogged Nikola Jokić and Dončić for -- [talks quietly through gritted teeth and waves hand at ongoing federal gambling investigations] -- the best odds to win Most Valuable Player and now trails only reigning MVP SGA at Caesars Sportsbook.Participation TrophyCooper Flagg played his first NBA game. It did not go how he wanted. The Mavs got stomped on their home floor by the Spurs. History will record that Flagg had a double-double, but those 10 points and 10 rebounds weren't impressive. He looked tentative for most of the game and didn't pad his scoring stats until later in the evening. Flagg shot just 30.8% from the floor and despite all the Point Cooper hype had no assists. He wasn't even the best rookie in that particular game; Dylan Harper, the No. 2 overall pick, had 15 points on 50% shooting in 23 minutes off the bench for San Antonio. Asked about his performance, Flagg summed it up nicely after the game saying it was \"not great.\" Better days are surely ahead -- perhaps as soon as Friday night when the Mavs play the Wizards. It's the Hope That Kills You AwardIf I may take off my NBA columnist hat for a moment and replace it with my battered, well-worn Philadelphia native hat, watching the Sixers during my lifetime has not been easy. This is a gross understatement. The organization last won a championship in 1983. The team hasn't been to the conference finals since Allen Iverson stepped over Ty Lue in 2001. That's the last good moment I can remember. In fairness my brain has been poisoned by covering much of the Process Sixers saga for assorted Philadelphia and national media outlets. At some point the mind tries to delete all those memories as a natural protection mechanism. \nThe Sixers went into last season with high hopes of potentially challenging for a conference title. It was an abject disaster instead. Joel Embiid played in 19 games. Paul George played in 41 and forgot how to shoot after coming off a career shooting season. Tyrese Maxey got shut down after 52 games. Even for a franchise that seemingly invents new miseries each season, it was a brutal campaign.But. There is a giant BUT here. It led to them late-season tanking their way into keeping their first-round pick, getting lucky in the lottery, and selecting VJ Edgecombe third overall.Edgecombe had 34 points, seven rebounds, three assists, five threes and shot 50% from the floor against the Celtics in his first professional basketball game. That's the third-most points in a debut in NBA history behind Wilt Chamberlain (43) and Frank Selvy (35). He rattled off 10 straight Sixers points in the first quarter, earned a shoutout from the NBA Twitter account, and put his much-hyped athleticism on immediate display. \nDon't give me hope. Acting Masterclass MedalMarcus Smart. Perhaps the finest thespian of our time.\nThat Wasn't the Plan RibbonThe Clippers were a fashionable pick to be sneaky good in a loaded Western Conference. I had them fifth in our preseason predictions. That's where they finished a year ago, but they beefed up a roster that won 50 games and took the Nuggets to Game 7 in the first round of the playoffs. This offseason they added John Collins and Brook Lopez to the frontcourt and Chris Paul and Bradley Beal to the backcourt. On paper the Clips came into the season looking like one of the deepest teams in the league.And those things might remain true. They might be one of the deepest teams and they might end up sneaky good. It is only one game -- but that one game did not go as they hoped. The Clippers -- an experienced group of vets, which is a nice placeholder for just saying they're the oldest team in the NBA -- got throttled in Utah, losing by 21 to a Jazz team that figures to be snack food for the ravenous West all season. James Harden had a double-double and Ivica Zubac was an efficient 9 for 13 from the floor. Didn't matter. The starting five with Kawhi Leonard (minus-25), Zubac (minus-21) and Harden (minus-21) got buried by the Jazz. I'm not a single-game plus-minus guy -- it can be grossly misleading -- but in this case it was a pretty accurate snapshot of an opening-night dud for Ty Lue and his guys. At least the Inside the NBA guys got to have a little fun with it. \nMidseason Form Medallion Draymond Green. It took him less than seven minutes into the first game of the season to get his first technical foul -- and he wasn't even on the floor. A classic of the genre.\nLevel Up AwardThere was a lot of buzz about how well Alperen Sengun played at EuroBasket this summer. I'll have to take everyone's word for it because the competition was a tough find here in the states. It was ostensibly broadcast on something called Courtside 1891, which is supposedly a real thing. Unsurprisingly, I didn't not catch much (any) EuroBasket. I did watch every second of the Rockets-Thunder game on Tuesday night, however, and Sengun was spectacular. He went for 39 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists, two steals and a block with 50/62.5/90.9 shooting splits. That's an eye-popping line but it was the 3-point shooting that really stood out. Sengun shot 5-for-8 from deep. A year ago, he only had 21 threes all season.\nSengun became the first player in NBA history with at least 35 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and five 3s in a season opener. He made his first All-Star team last season. It's only one game but if the distance shooting is legit, All-NBA could be next. Full Russell Westbrook Experience CertificateRussell Westbrook has played in 1,238 NBA games and has won this award in every single one. He is incapable of turning off his Russ-ness. Indeed, his first game with the Kings went about as you'd expect. Here he is turning the ball over at one end, then racing down the floor for a chase-down block.\nThat sort of maddening Russ giveth-and-taketh-away default position is a big reason why he's now on his seventh team in the last six seasons. Why he's on this particular team has a lot of people confused, however. Surely he makes no sense on a roster full of heavy-usage ball dominant players including Zach LaVine, DeMar DeRozan and newly acquired Dennis Schröder. That seems like a pretty awful fit however you mix and match them, especially at the defensive end. But then again, if you think about it, it's also sort of the perfect fit, because where else would soon-to-be 37-year-old Russ make any sense but with a Kings organization that makes no sense to anyone outside of the Kings. Russ has to be Russ and the Kings can't help but be the Kangz and actually I get it now and it's beautiful. \nChris Webber PrizeThis frankly isn't fair to Kevin Durant or Chris Webber for that matter. Webber made one (admittedly huge) mistake back in college and it has followed him around ever since. Unlike Webber, KD got bailed out by the officials failing to see him call for a timeout the Rockets did not have near the end of the first overtime even though all the Thunder players, coaches and fans in the arena clocked it.\nThat would have been a bad way to end a great game. Instead, it ended with an exhausted KD trying to guard SGA -- a man 10 years his junior -- as the reigning MVP danced with the ball toward the end of the second overtime. Durant steamrolled him, fouled out, and SGA nailed both free throws to win the game by a point. The Ball Don't Lie Gods evidently demanded a sacrifice after the timeout snafu. Iron Men MedalsJoel Embiid, Zion Williamson and Ja Morant are on pace to play 82 games. \n            ",

The visiting Dodgers will start lefty ace Blake Snell, and he'll oppose Blue Jays right-hander Trey Yesavage. First pitch is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET. Snell, 32, will be making his fourth start of the 2025 postseason. Over the previous three starts, he's pitched to an ERA of 0.86 with 28 strikeouts and five unintentional walks in 21 innings. Those numbers include an eight-inning gem against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series in which Snell struck out 10 with no walks and only one hit allowed. During the regular season, his first with the Dodgers after signing a five-year free-agent pact, Snell was limited to just 11 starts because of shoulder inflammation. Over those 61 ⅓ innings, however, Snell thrived with a 2.35 ERA (177 ERA+) and an FIP of 2.70. In all, Snell in the playoffs has an ERA of 2.58 over 13 starts and two relief appearances.\nYesavage at 22 years and 88 days old will become the second-youngest Game 1 starter in World Series history. As Sarah Langs notes, only Ralph Branca of the 1947 Brookyn Dodgers was younger.\nThis season, Yesavage made just three major-league starts in the regular season following his mid-September call-up. In those three starts, he put up a 3.21 ERA with 16 strikeouts and seven unintentional walks in 14 innings. After that, he made three starts in the playoffs, including two against the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS. Over those three starts, Yesavage had an ERA of 4.20 with 22 strikeouts and six unintentional walks in 15 combined innings.\"It's something I never even would have dreamed of, but I'm here now and I'm embracing it fully and I'm so happy to be here,\" the rookie said Thursday.\nYesavage comes into Friday's Game 1 start on the standard four days of rest. Snell, meantime, will be making his first start since Oct. 13. \n            \n    ",

UFC 321 emanates from the Etihad Arena with a pair of title fights atop the marquee. Most notably, the main event serves as the first undisputed title defense for heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall when he takes on Ciryl Gane. Aspinall was elevated from interim titleholder when Jon Jones announced his abrupt retirement.Aspinall now gets his chance as the leading man after two years of turmoil. He was one of four fighters ever to defend an interim title as Jones continued to avoid the matchup while fighting just once against Stipe Miocic, who made his first appearance in over four years. Aspinall's lone blemish was avenged in that interim title defense when he TKO'd Curtis Blaydes. Aspinall lost that first meeting with Blaydes after suffering a knee injury in the opening minute of the bout. Gane, meanwhile, bounced back from his defeat to Jones with a pair of wins to earn his shot at the crown.Meanwhile, the second title fight is guaranteed to produce a new champion. Zhang Weili vacated the women's strawweight crown when she made the decision to move up and challenge Valentina Shevchenko for the flyweight title.

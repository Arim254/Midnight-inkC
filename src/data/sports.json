    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl brings the most betting opportunities of any sporting event each year, and Super Bowl 60 between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots is no different. One of the popular Super Bowl props is the MVP award, which is handed out after the game. Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold is the +120 favorite (risk $100 to win $120) in the Super Bowl 60 odds at DraftKings, while Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is +240. While quarterbacks are the most likely winners, three of the last 10 winners have come from non-quarterback positions. This provides longshot betting opportunities for other players in Patriots vs. Seahawks. CBS Sports gambling and Fantasy sports managing editor R.J. White went 718-623-37 on NFL against-the-spread picks from 2017-24, returning more than $3,200 to $100 players as SportsLine's No. 1 NFL expert in ATS picks. He's also gone 22-15-1 (+545) in his last 38 over/under picks, and now he's sharing his Super Bowl 60 MVP picks.Here are the latest odds for Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings:\nSuper Bowl MVP picksBest bet: Seahawks QB Sam Darnold (+120)Best longshot value: Patriots WR Mack Hollins (+18000)Defensive longshot: Seahawks LB DeMarcus Lawrence (+9000)Sam Darnold, Seahawks (+120)\"When it comes to taking a player to win Super Bowl MVP, the safest play is to back a quarterback,\" White said. \"Fourteen of the last 19 Super Bowl MVPs have been quarterbacks, with the position winning the award 34 times overall versus eight times for receivers, seven times for running backs and 10 times for any defensive player. With the Seahawks being huge favorites on the money line, taking Darnold to win Super Bowl MVP presents the best value on the board by getting plus odds for them winning and the award going to the most likely candidate.\"Mack Hollins, Patriots (+18000)\"The Patriots have been criticized for playing an easy schedule this year, but when the tougher opponents have shown up, Hollins has tended to be more involved in the offense,\" White said. \"After a quiet first seven weeks, he caught all seven of his targets for 89 yards in Week 8 against a Browns defense that held Stefon Diggs to 14 yards. He delivered a season-best 106 yards on 10 targets in Week 10 in a close game against the Buccaneers, again outperforming Diggs by a wide margin. He had just 41 yards in Week 15 against the Bills but saw a team-high eight targets in the game while Diggs had four, and then the next week Hollins racked up 69 yards on nine targets in a comeback win over the Ravens, with Diggs leading the team in all receiving categories in that one. Hollins went to IR after that game and returned for the AFC Championship, where he recorded catches of 31 and 20 yards in a game where Maye threw for just 86 yards total.\"Hollins definitely doesn't deserve to be among the favorites for the award, but he should be much closer to Stefon Diggs (+5500) considering how much Maye leans on the secondary receiver in big games. And when compared to the other players ahead of Hollins in odds, including guys like Jake Bobo and George Holani who may not make any impact on the box score for Seattle as well as both backup QBs and a number of defensive players, Hollins stands out as the best value pick on the board.\"DeMarcus Lawrence, Seahawks (+9000)\"There hasn't been a defensive player to win Super Bowl MVP since Von Miller 10 years ago, but it happens more than you think and doesn't necessarily have to be the best defender on the team, with Malcolm Smith and Dexter Jackson taking home the award this century as well,\" White said. \"While that brings super longshots like Jaylinn Hawkins (+25000) and Drake Thomas (+25000) into play, my favorite defensive pick is Lawrence. He'll be up against a Patriots offensive line that has struggled to protect Maye during the playoffs, and the quarterback has had a massive issue hanging onto the ball.\"Lawrence has a sack and forced fumble in three of his last four games, and he's recorded at least one QB hit in 13 of the last 14 games. With the veteran playing in his first Super Bowl after more than a decade with the Cowboys, he could continue his recent fine form, and if he can score a touchdown after recovering a fumble, which he did twice against the Cardinals earlier this year, he could be in contention for this award in a lower-scoring game. I'd put Lawrence at least as the co-favorite among Seahawks defenders, but he's slotted behind Ernest Jones and Nick Emmanwori, so he's my favorite value among the defenders.\"Want more Super Bowl 60 picks?Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl is the biggest betting event of the year, and the wagers available for the NFL's championship game aren't restricted to what happens when the ball is in motion. The wagering options on Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings include everything from the coin toss (-103 on both Heads and Tails) to an over/under on the jersey number of the first touchdown scorer (Over 10.5, -160; Under 10.5, +120) to a quarterback to catch a pass (+1100). One of the more popular Super Bowl 60 props is sure to be the run time of the national anthem, although the market may not be available to you depending on your location.Charlie Puth will be singing the anthem before Sunday's game between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, set for a 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Seahawks enter Sunday's showdown as 4.5-point favorites, and the over/under for total points scored is 45.5. Before you sweat your coin-toss bet, you might be on the edge of your seat, and watching the stopwatch, as Puth belts out the national anthem so you can stack up some winnings before the action starts.CBS Sports gambling and Fantasy sports managing editor R.J. White has been analyzing Super Bowl for years and is one of SportsLine's top NFL experts -- he is on a 29-15 roll (+1323) on his NFL picks this season. White also has also had past success betting Super Bowl entertainment props and has hit the National Anthem prop in the past five Super Bowls. Last year, White expected Jon Batiste to add some musical flourishes or a solo to the anthem, and the multiple Grammy winner just eclipsed the projected 120.5-second run time. Puth has said he hopes to bring a jazzy feel to the song Sunday, but what does that mean for the run time? White has taken a close look at it, and now he's sharing his Super Bowl 60 national anthem pick.   Here are the latest odds for Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings:\nSuper Bowl national anthem pickR.J. White's national anthem length pick: Under 120.5 seconds (-125)White's analysis: I started making picks on the length of the Super Bowl national anthem for SportsLine six years ago, and it's been quite the ride. Before making each pick, I dug into old performances of the anthem for each artist and any quotes I could find about their upcoming rendition, then applied what I know about their musical style to get a feel for the projected length. Sometimes it's easy; back in 2021, the NFL gave us a duet that was certain to fly Over the posted total. The last few years have been tougher and featured some very close calls, but I've managed to get it right every single time. That's right, we're entering this year's rendition with an active 5-0 streak on picking the length of the national anthem.This is likely going to be another close call where it's tough to have a strong play either way. Charlie Puth is delivering the national anthem, an opportunity for which he took the initiative of sending an audition tape to Roc Nation before landing the gig of a lifetime. He talked about that process and why he so badly wanted the opportunity in a Rolling Stone interview, saying that he feels pressure to live up to the precedent set by Whitney Houston (a New Jersey native like Puth), and he also noted a desire to stand out like Chris Stapleton did in 2023.Puth shared a video of him playing the national anthem on keyboard on YouTube five years ago, but I don't know that there's much to take away from it. He's said recently that he plans to have a bit of a jazzy feel to his rendition, which he claimed all came together in his head clearly (whether he can translate it to the big stage is another thing).While he feels pressure to prove himself as a vocalist with this performance, I'm going to lean to the Under here, particularly if you can lock in a number higher than two minutes. My expectation is that Puth will have some type of instrumental intro cooked up before he sings the first line of the song, which is what starts the stopwatch for this prop market, and as such he'll keep the vocal portion a little tighter than some performers from the recent past. I expect our final anthem time to clock in somewhere between 115 and 120 seconds.Head to SportsLine for more Super Bowl picks, both from proven experts and the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every game 10,000 times and enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024.

They will become the second American duo to share the honor at the Winter Olympics.Jackson is the ninth speed skater in U.S. history to bear the flag and follows Brittany Bowe, who replaced bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor to open the 2022 Beijing Winter Games after the latter tested positive for COVID-19. Del Duca is the sixth bobsledder selected for the role and, because of Meyers Taylor's absence four years ago, will be the first in 70 years to carry the flag at an opening ceremony.This is the second consecutive Winter Olympics in which Team USA selected two flag bearers.The Opening Ceremony will air live in the United States at 2 p.m. ET on Friday. Follow along with our live coverage of the Opening Ceremonies, including all the incredible musical performances and the walk of nations. \nWho is Erin Jackson?Jackson, 33, made her Winter Olympic debut in 2018 at the Pyeongchang Winter Games. Her breakthrough came four years later when she became the first Black American woman to medal in speed skating and the first Black woman to win gold in an individual sport. Her 500m speed skating victory at the Beijing Winter Games snapped a two-decade drought for American women atop the speed skating podium.\"Being chosen to represent the United States on the world stage is a tremendous honor,\" Jackson said. \"It's a moment that reflects far more than one individual -- it represents my family, my teammates, my hometown, and everyone across the country who believes in the power of sport. The Olympics remind us of the power of sport to connect and inspire, and I'm proud to carry that forward on the Olympic stage.\"\n        \n            \n                2026 Winter Olympics: Team USA athletes to watch, medal favorites, potential breakout stars in each sport\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson hails from Ocala, Florida, and graduated from the University of Florida. The longtime roller skater had just four months of experience in speed skating on ice when she qualified for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Since then, she has accumulated six medals on the world stage.\nWho is Frank Del Duca?Del Duca, 34, will make his second Winter Olympic appearance this month after debuting at the Beijing Games. The bobsled pilot finished 13th in the two-man and four-man competitions in 2022.\"Being flag bearer for Team USA is an incredible honor,\" Del Duca said. \"It was also quite the surprise. I'm grateful for the support from my teammates, coaches and staff, Team USA, U.S. Army WCAP, family and friends, and everyone who has helped me on this journey. With the Olympic Games being held in Italy, it means even more. Nearly everyone in my family is of Italian descent.\"There is no greater honor than leading Team USA into the Opening Ceremony in Italy. It feels like a bridge between my family's heritage, and the country I'm so proud to serve. I know my grandfather is watching over me saying, \"Hey, Frangesch, way to go kid,\" and would be so proud.\"\nAfter winning the high school state championship in alpine skiing, the Bethel, Maine, native walked on to the University of Maine track and field team. He attended a bobsled combine after college and joined the U.S. Bobsled team as a push athlete, and after missing out on a selection for the 2018 U.S. Olympic Team, he moved to the pilot position.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most exciting annual sports days on the calendar, and millions of Americans watch football for the touchdowns. With online sports betting becoming legalized in more states, anytime touchdown scorer bets have become among the most popular bets you can make on any NFL Sunday, especially for Super Bowl Sunday. The 2026 Super Bowl features the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET, and Seattle and New England both had top-10 scoring offenses, which could lead to plenty of potential winning Super Bowl 60 anytime touchdown scorer bets. The over/under for total points scored in Seahawks vs. Patriots is 45.5, while the Seahawks are favored by 4.5 points. The SportsLine Projection Model has simulated Super Bowl 60 10,000 times, and found multiple players with value to cash 2026 Super Bowl anytime TD scorer bets. One of the model's top picks is Seahawks star wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who has scored a touchdown in each of Seattle's first two playoff games. \nThe model projects that to continue, locking in Smith-Njigba as one of its best bets for Super Bowl 2026 anytime touchdown scorer picks. The model is also backing a pair of Patriots, projecting value in both New England running back Rhamondre Stevenson and wide receiver Kayshon Boutte to score in Super Bowl 60. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Super Bowl betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in Super Bowl 60 at DraftKings, the SportsLine Projection Model can help you find value to add to your 2026 Super Bowl picks. Super Bowl 60 anytime touchdown picks:Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (-110)Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (+140)Kayshon Boutte, Patriots (+320)\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks (-110)\nThe third-year receiver is staking his claim as the best wideout in the NFL. He led the league with 1,793 receiving yards this season, while finishing fourth in receptions (119) and tied for sixth with 10 touchdowns. Smith-Njigba was nearly unstoppable against the Rams last week, posting 10 receptions for 153 yards and a touchdown on 12 targets. He's scored in both playoff games, as, despite teams knowing he's going to be the focal point of the offense, Seattle still finds ways to scheme him open while other teams can't stop him, even with multiple defenders. The model projects the 23-year-old to score in 65% of simulations, compared to his implied probability of 52.4%.Rhamondre Stevenson, Patriots (+140)\nThe 27-year-old running back appeared to be being pushed out of the top spot in the backfield toward the end of the regular season, with rookie TreVeyon Henderson playing more snaps as the season progressed, but New England has made it clear which back it trusts more for the postseason run. Stevenson outsnapped Henderson 60-4 last week, with the veteran playing 94% of snaps against the Broncos. Stevenson has played at least 62% of snaps in all three playoff games, with Henderson's snaps never totaling more than 41%. Stevenson had at least one rushing touchdown in each of New England's final three regular-season games, and the model projects him to score in 53% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 41.7%.Kayshon Boutte, Patriots (+320)\nBoutte leads the Patriots with 147 receiving yards this postseason, and he's one of four New England pass catchers with a touchdown during the playoffs (no Patriot has more than one). He is second behind Stefon Diggs in receptions (eight) and targets (15), yet he's only third among Patriots pass catchers in anytime touchdown odds and eighth for all players at DraftKings. During the regular season, he was second on the Patriots in touchdown receptions (six), which doubled his touchdown total over the first two years of his career. The model projects him to score in 31% of simulations, which shows strong value for a player priced at more than 3-1 odds. Want more Super Bowl NFL picks? You've seen the best model Super Bowl 60 anytime touchdown picks.

However, that also means they aren't making it easy to make 2026 Super Bowl predictions which such a small ATS margin between them.Seattle is favored by 4.5 points (O/U 45.5) per the latest Super Bowl odds from DraftKings Sportsbook. Underdogs have covered 52.6% of the time in Super Bowl history, which is close to the flip of a coin, so that Super Bowl spread trend may not help much with your Seahawks vs. Patriots bets. Thus, seeking out some NFL betting advice is essential. Before locking in any Super Bowl picks or NFL prop bets, be sure to check out the Super Bowl best bets and predictions from SportsLine's red-hot Vegas experts. \nSportsLine has more than 40 hand-picked Vegas experts who excel in multiple spots. The NFL, however, is a strength for the site as SportsLine currently has five total experts who are on NFL runs that have returned $1,000 or more for $100 players and one who has returned more than $1,500.

Go to SportsLine to see them all now.Top Super Bowl expert picks from Micah RobertsRoberts, a former Vegas bookmaker, is 11-4 (+658) over his last 15 Patriots ATS picks. For Super Bowl 60, Roberts is backing Seattle (-4.5) to cover.\"The Patriots went 9-0 in away games, and the Seahawks went 8-1 in road games. Seattle won nine games in a row, with the last five games being against playoff teams and covering the last four. Drake Maye has looked shaky over the last few weeks, as has his offensive line. The Seahawks were No. 1 in the NFL against the rush number, 6th in total yards allowed (293.4), and No. 1 in total points (17.1) allowed. The real betting hasn't begun. I think this line moves through 5 and 5.5 quickly and closes 6.\" See all of Roberts' picks here, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:\nTop Super Bowl props from Todd FuhrmanA Vegas insider who shared first place in the inaugural Circa Survivor contest, Fuhrman is 14-6 (+440.5) over his last 20 NFL player props picks. For Super Bowl LX, he is backing Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III Under 77.5 rushing yards (-125).\"New England's run defense is damn stout with the return of Milton Williams and I don't expect that to change in two weeks. Kenneth Walker is being asked to take on a bigger workload in the absence of Zach Charbonnet however we saw his effectiveness wane against the Rams as his touches increased, Walker is a dynamic playmaker and he'll be leaned into for sure although it might be more as a receiver than runner vs this Pats defense.\" See the rest of Fuhrman's picks here, and bet that prop here:\nTop Super Bowl predictions from Matt SeveranceSeverance has returned $2,010 for $100 bettors over the last two NFL seasons and is 10-3 (+842.5) over his last 13 NFL picks. He is backing the Under (45.5) in Patriots vs. Seahawks.\"It is an outdoor game so maybe we get some elements in Santa Clara. But giving Mike Macdonald two weeks to prepare for sack- and fumble-prone Drake Maye makes me think Seattle will keep that New England offense in check. That offense did very little in the AFC title game. And I'm sure the Pats' defense will have some surprises for Sam Darnold, too. Our model has 44 points.\" See the rest of Severance's picks here, and bet the total here:\nHow to make 2026 Super Bowl picksSportsLine's team of experts also includes Brady Kannon, a former SuperContest winner who enters Super Bowl LX on a sizzling 29-15 run (66%) on NFL picks, returning over $1,200 for $100 players. You can find out who his NFL picks are for the Super Bowl 2026 here. If you are looking for NFL picks, NFL props, or NFL best bets for Super Bowl 60, SportsLine has you covered with its proven team of experts.

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props like Kenneth Walker anytime touchdown (-195) to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, such as the Seahawks prevailing by 1-6 points (+275) or New England winning by 1-6 points at +300. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters the 2026 Super Bowl on a 53-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now that the simulation model has had a chance to digest the Super Bowl 60 NFL odds, it's locked in its betting picks to form a longshot NFL parlay that could pay out $15,000 for a $10 bettor. You can only see the picks and full parlay by heading to SportsLine.\nTop 2026 Super Bowl parlay picksFor Super Bowl LX, one of the picks featured in the longshot parlay is Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte as an anytime TD scorer (+310). Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

    "body": "\n        The final NFL DFS slate of the season arrives on Sunday at Levi's Stadium when the 2026 Super Bowl unfolds between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots (+4.5, 45.5 at DraftKings) at 6:30 p.m. ET. Some of the year's biggest daily Fantasy producers will be on display as Seattle receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was second among receivers in Fantasy points, while New England quarterback Drake Maye was third among quarterbacks. They'll be popular NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60, but are they the best values, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel? There's always a player or two who comes out of nowhere to make a huge impact in The Big Game. Before making any NFL daily Fantasy picks for the 2026 Super Bowl, be sure to check out the NFL DFS advice, strategy and stacks from SportsLine daily Fantasy expert Mike McClure.McClure is a legendary professional DFS player with more than $2 million in career winnings. He uses a powerful prediction model that simulates every snap of NFL action, taking factors such as matchups, statistical trends, and injuries into account. This allows him to find the best DFS values that he shares only with members at SportsLine. His methodology has led to enormous cashes on FanDuel and DraftKings. In 2023, he finished tied for first in the DraftKings Millionaire Maker twice and the FanDuel Million once. Anyone who has followed him could be way up.\nNow, McClure has turned his attention to the 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS slate and just locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. You can only see his picks and analysis at SportsLine. \nTop NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60One of McClure's top NFL DFS picks for Super Bowl 60 is Smith-Njigba, who is looking to cap a monster season where he led the NFL in receiving yardage at 1,793. After a relatively quiet week in the divisional round, he got back to his dominant ways against the Rams in the NFC Championship Game, posting a 10-153-1 receiving line. By Super Bowl standards, the Patriots did not have an elite Fantasy defense against receivers this season, ranking 10th in Fantasy points allowed to that position group. They've also given up a touchdown to an opposing receiver in three of the past four games. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and new users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins, and bet Smith-Njigba to go Over 94.5 receiving yards at DraftKings:\nMcClure is also building his NFL DFS strategy around Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp. The 32-year-old has become a secondary option this season, but he has seen his target share increase a bit in the NFL playoffs. That helped lead to a touchdown against the Rams in the NFC title game. With elite New England cornerback Christian Gonzalez likely shadowing Smith-Njigba for much of the game, there's a great chance that Kupp will get more opportunities on Sunday, all at a very affordable NFL DFS price. See who else to roster at SportsLine, and bet Kupp to go Over 32.5 receiving yards at DraftKings: \nHow to set 2026 Super Bowl NFL DFS lineupsMcClure is targeting an undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers in Patriots vs. Seahawks. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing. You can only see who it is, and the rest of McClure's NFL DFS picks, at SportsLine.\nSo who is Mike McClure including in his optimal NFL DFS lineups for the Super Bowl, and which under-the-radar player offers huge value? Visit SportsLine now to see optimal NFL DFS picks, NFL DFS rankings, NFL DFS advice and NFL DFS stacks, all from a daily Fantasy expert with more than $2 million in winnings, and find out. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        UFC bantamweights are front and center. The four highest-ranked bantamweights all recently competed in major fights. On Saturday, Mario Bautista and Vinicius Oliveira step into the spotlight.People are starting to wake up to the skill of Bautista (16-3). The Arizona native had won eight fights in a row since 2022 before getting a step up opportunity against top contender Umar Nurmagomedov. While he was swept on the scorecards, Bautista put up a strong effort in defeat. Bautista stunned Nurmagomedov with a knee and nearly yanked his foot off with a toehold. His strong showing, plus a dominant win over former Bellator bantamweight champion Patchy Mix, helped mend fan feelings after his contentious win over the great Jose Aldo.\"I thought I blew the [Nurmagomedov] fight. That's the mindset I had,\" Bautista told CBS Sports. \"Being around people saying, 'That was an awesome fight. You actually went out there and fought him. You didn't hold anything back.' I'm glad people saw that from me. I think that's what landed me this main event.\"On Saturday, Bautista can utilize his wealth of experience against a fighter with a rapidly rising profile.\nSign up for Paramount+ and Watch UFC Fight Night: Bautista vs. Oliveira for no additional fee -- every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!\"His hand placements,\" Bautista said of Oliveira's technical gaps. \"Outside of the UFC, I saw three separate videos of him getting knocked out. He lives and dies by the sword. I think there's a higher possibility for that to happen the higher you climb up the UFC rankings.Oliveira (23-3) is a madman. He marches forward with his hands down and strikes from odd angles. Oliveira is already calling out elite stars like Nurmagomedov, Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili only four fights into his UFC career. \"Lok Dog\" won't be far from those conversations if he makes good on his first-round knockout prediction.\n\"No one in the top five wants to fight me. They're all close to fighting for the belt. If UFC asked them to fight 'Lok Dog,' they'd say no...\" Oliveira told CBS Sports. \"They don't want to fight me because they have many things to lose. \"I'm dangerous in this division. When you see me fight, you can see I'm crazy. I move forward with my hands down. I dodge stuff and throw punches from nowhere. I'm not technical or orthodox. It's strange to fight me. If I were someone in front of me, I'd run away. I wouldn't want to face me.\"Saturday's co-main event has important implications for the flyweight division. Kyoji Horiguchi, who enjoyed four title reigns between Rizin and Bellator, has the second fight of his second UFC stint. To date, Demetrious \"Mighty Mouse\" Johnson is the only flyweight to beat Horiguchi. The Japanese star could make a serious splash in the title conversation by beating Amir Albazi. Once considered a future title contender, significant health issues have stunted Albazi's career. Heart and neck surgery are among the serious procedures that Albazi underwent over the last few years.\nLet's take a look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.UFC Fight Night card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookFavoriteUnderdogWeightclassMario Bautista -170Vinicius Oliveira +142Bantamweight  Kyoji Horiguchi -375Amir Albazi +295FlyweightJailton Almeida -155Rizvan Kuniev +130HeavyweightMichal Oleksiejczuk -500Marc-Andre Barriault +380MiddleweightFarid Basharat -285Jean Matsumoto +230BantamweightDustin Jacoby -185Julius Walker +154Light heavyweightUFC Fight Night viewing informationDate: Saturday, Feb. 7 | Start time: 8 p.m. ETLocation: Meta APEX -- Las VegasStream: Paramount+ (subscribe now for as little as $8.99 per month)PredictionMario Bautista vs. Vinicius Oliveira: Oliveira doesn't seem concerned with Bautista, technique, or much else. You can chalk up his swagger to some combination of confidence and stubbornness. Oliveira was a vicious KO artist on the regional scene. Things haven't come so easily for him in the UFC. He might not like that, but I do. Oliveira showed that his skills hold up over 15 minutes. Saturday's headliners are surprisingly similar considering their contrasting personalities and game plans. They have comparable striking offense and defense stats, though Oliveira sees less artillery coming his way. They're also difficult to ground. I'm torn here. Bautista's performance against Nurmagomedov opened my eyes to how good he is. I don't think he'll finish Oliveira, and that creates concerns about a potential KO loss over 25 minutes. However, Oliveira's inexperience against elite fighters and failure to finish his last three opponents are more concerning. I'll side with the veteran over five rounds. Pick: Bautista via unanimous decision\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Penn State hockey star Gavin McKenna will no longer face a felony charge stemming from his involvement in an altercation that occurred at a bar in State College, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night. McKenna, the potential No. 1 pick in the 2026 NHL Draft, was initially charged with felony aggravated assault after an incident at Doggie's Pub in the hours after Penn State's outdoor game against Michigan State at Beaver Stadium. However, Centre County district attorney Bernie Cantorna wrote in a statement Friday that the felony charge against McKenna has been dropped following a review of video evidence and learning the extent of the man's injuries -- which weren't as severe as initially reported.McKenna, 18, still faces a misdemeanor count of simple assault and summary offenses of harassment and disorderly conduct. He has a preliminary hearing for those charges scheduled for Feb. 11.The complaint says the alleged victim \"was punched twice on the right side of his face\" following \"an exchange of words between the alleged victim's group and the group of people with McKenna.\" According to the Centre Daily Times, the injured man was \"heckling McKenna and his mother after the game.\"\nThe initial complaint alleged that the victim \"sustained fractures to both sides of his jaw,\" requiring surgery, and was \"missing a tooth.\" However, a police investigation determined the victim \"sustained two fractures to one side of his jaw ... and was not missing a tooth.\" The man \"had surgery and is recovering,\" Cantorna said. \"In order to establish probable cause for the crime of Aggravated Assault, the Commonwealth must establish that a person acted with the intent to cause serious bodily injury or acted recklessly under circumstances showing an extreme indifference to the value of human life. Both the District Attorney's Office and the State College Police Department have reviewed video evidence of this incident and do not believe that a charge of Aggravated Assault is supported by the evidence,\" Cantorna said in a release from the District Attorney's office. \"Accordingly, the District Attorney's Office will be withdrawing the felony count of Aggravated Assault and correcting the record regarding the injuries suffered by the victim. A review of the video does not support a conclusion that Gavin McKenna acted with the intent to cause serious bodily injury or with reckless indifference to the value of human life.\"McKenna, a freshman forward from Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada, has 32 points -- 11 goals and 21 assists -- in 24 games this season for the Nittany Lions. McKenna, touted before his arrival at Penn State as a potential generational prospect, had a goal and had two assists on Saturday. Prior to his arrival at Penn State, McKenna starred as a 17-year-old in the Western Hockey League in Canada, posting 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) for the Medicine Hat Tigers in 58 regular season games, and helped lead them to a WHL championship. Thanks to an NCAA rule change, McKenna is part of the first class of young Canadian stars who played at the top junior levels in Canada to be allowed to play college hockey in the United States. \nMcKenna's status with the Penn State hockey team is unclear. The Nittany Lions (18-8) next play on the road against Michigan on Feb. 13. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In May 2025, when Tottenham defeated Manchester United to win the Europa League final, despite both teams finishing in the bottom third of the Premier League, it seemed like the North London club was on the rise while United were destined to spend the next season in turmoil. Fast forward only nine months, and while both teams now have new managers, they couldn't be in much different places as they prepare to meet on Sunday at Old Trafford.How to watch Manchester United vs. Tottenham, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 7 | Time: 7:30 a.m. ETLocation: Old Trafford -- Manchester, EnglandTV: USAOdds: Manchester United -175; Draw +350; Tottenham +400After being told that 10 places separate the sides in the Premier League, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it was Tottenham who are further up the table, especially after bringing in a highly regarded manager in Thomas Frank during the summer. But, it's instead the Red Devils who can strengthen their hold on prospective Champions League soccer under interim manager Michael Carrick. It's an improvement that was happening before Carrick took over, with good summer business improving key positions such as goalkeeper and the attack, but taking over and winning three matches on the bounce over Manchester City, Arsenal, and Fulham is an impressive start. It's far too early to declare that \"Fergie time\" is back, but the fact that the two most recent victories came via goals in the 85th and 95th minute of play. It's clear that whatever Carrick is preaching during his time as manager is working.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            The same can't be said for Frank's Tottenham. While injuries to Mohammed Kudus and James Maddison don't help the creativity of the team, the fact that Tottenham haven't won a Premier League game since December is a problem. They've drawn four and lost two while tumbling down the table with extreme momentum.\nFewest points collected since January 1TeamNumber of pointsCrystal Palace3Burnley3Tottenham4Wolverhampton5Four-way tie6Being on a list with all the teams in the relegation race isn't good company, yet Tottenham were able to secure a place in the last 16 of the Champions League, which makes their form such a conundrum. There are good things happening under Frank, but it hasn't been repeatable. Winning a game like this would be significant for improving the outlook on his managemnent but coming up against a tough United side, it also won't be an easy task. \nThis is far from the matchup that was expected at Old Trafford at this juncture of the season, but that's also what makes soccer fascinating. At any given point, teams can swap places in the table and need to fight back to the top. That's where Tottenham are at the moment, and if Frank wants to remain as manager next season, the wins will need to return sooner rather than later.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        There are major college basketball games between rivals, and there is Duke vs. North Carolina.There is a difference.The 266th all-time meeting between the two will take place Saturday in Chapel Hill in what may be a potential inflection point for No. 14 UNC as it welcomes No. 4 Duke into the Dean Dome. UNC is on the prowl looking to rebound after losing all three meetings vs. Duke a year ago, and in the process it is hunting to burnish its burgeoning NCAA Tournament resume after winning its last four games in ACC play.Doing so under the immense pressure this rivalry presents will no doubt be a challenge, though, because Davis' team will be underdogs on their home court for the first time all season. And Davis is not only well aware of the pressures surrounding him and his program entering the matchup but also attuned with the fact that for those in and around the Tobacco Road, this is not just a rivalry.\"The main thing I've tried to communicate to the guys is that our preparation, our process, the way we practice, the way we play is no different,\" Davis said Thursday. \"Only difference is: the circus is coming to town.\"\nThere will be no clowns or acrobats, but Davis is undoubtedly walking a tightrope as UNC's fifth-year coach. He led UNC to the NCAA Tournament championship game in Year 1, but he has led them past the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament just once since. \n        \n            \n                Duke vs. UNC: Cameron Boozer and Caleb Wilson set up rivalry's best NBA prospect matchup in last 40 years\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDavis entered the season on the hot seat and in need to prove himself after barely making the tourney a year ago, losing thrice to Duke and getting outclassed by its rival at every turn. He has his team 18-4 and things have turned for the better. But with a 4-6 career record as head coach vs. Duke, he will be under scrutiny more than most games this weekend.Even if he said Thursday that the game vs. Duke is \"just another game.\"A loss Saturday for his team, to be frank, is expected given the odds -- Duke is favored by roughly 6 points -- so I hesitate to overstate the game's importance for Davis and for UNC. He's not getting canned if they lose. But you cannot understate just how momentous a win would be for this program at this point vs. this team. Duke is barreling toward an ACC championship and a No. 1 seed. Stopping that freight train on the tracks would take some gusto and breathe life into the Heels at a time it needs it.\nIt's a tall task and one Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who is in just his fourth season as Blue Devils coach, will not likely make easy. Scheyer is 5-2 coaching vs. the Tar Heels since taking over in 2022-23, and two of the three seasons he's been head coach in Durham he has led the Blue Devils to a season sweep of UNC. A tide turn in favor of the Tar Heels feels vital -- for UNC, of course, but also, and maybe especially, for Davis.When the chips are down Saturday, the drama of the rivalry, the pressures of the hot seat and the lofty expectations foisted upon both schools and coaches will largely be lost to the noise of competition. It's UNC vs. Duke. They'll settle this one the old-fashioned way on the hardwood. But Davis will be prepped and ready to play the game within the game vs. one of college basketball's best and brightest young coaches in Scheyer to try and get his program back on top vs. its rival. It's been weeks since UNC last lost, and nearly two months since Duke last lost. These teams are rumbling in and will be raring to go. \n\"We've established a way that we want to play on both ends of the floor,\" Davis, who with a win can improve to a career-best 19-4 start, said Thursday. \"That's the chess match: being able to [try] to do what we've done throughout the year consistently well.\"\n            ",

Schwartz became defensive coordinator ahead of the 2023 season and was under contract through 2026. He had been considered a candidate for the team's vacancy after Cleveland fired Kevin Stefanski, but the position went to Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken.\"Yesterday, Jim Schwartz submitted his letter of resignation as defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns,\" the Browns said in a statement. \"We'd like to thank Jim for his contributions to our organization over the last three seasons. Our search for a new defensive coordinator will begin immediately.\"Despite the team's 5-12 record this past season, Schwartz's defense ranked fourth in the NFL in total yards allowed, giving up 283.6 yards per game. The unit recorded 53 sacks, including 23 from NFL Defensive Player of the Year Myles Garrett, a single-season league record. Cleveland also allowed 167.2 passing yards per game, second-best in the AFC.\nSchwartz has extensive NFL experience, including a five-year tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles, where he won Super Bowl LII as defensive coordinator, and a stint as head coach of the Detroit Lions from 2009 to 2013. He later worked with the Tennessee Titans as a senior defensive assistant before joining the Browns.Reports in January indicated Schwartz was disappointed at being passed over for the head-coaching role. Monken had expressed openness to keeping him as defensive coordinator.\nSchwartz's departure could affect other defensive staff members and players. He had been linked to openings with the San Francisco 49ers, who hired former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, and the Eagles if Vic Fangio retires.\n            \n    ",

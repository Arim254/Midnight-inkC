    "body": "\n        The second edition of Zuffa Boxing takes place Sunday from the Meta APEX in Las Vegas. In the main event, former junior welterweight champion Jose Valenzuela will take on Diego Torres.Valenzuela started his career 12-0 before running into Edwin De Los Santos in 2022. That night, Valenzuela suffered a third-round knockout for the first loss of his career. That loss was followed by a widely disputed decision loss to Chris Colbert. Valenzuela would get revenge against Colbert in an immediate rematch, scoring a sixth-round knockout with a devastating right hand.Sign up for Paramount+ and watch Zuffa Boxing 02 live on Sunday night for no additional fee. Plus, every UFC numbered event and UFC Fight Night is included with the price of your subscription! Plans start as low as $8.99/month or $89.99/year!The win over Colbert was enough to set Valenzuela up for the biggest fight of his career, a shot at Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz for the WBA junior welterweight title. Valenzuela made good on the opportunity with a measured performance to edge out a split decision in a major upset.\nValenzuela was unable to repeat that solid performance in his first title defense -- and most recent fight -- when he was nearly shut out by Gary Antuanne Russell to lose the belt.Valenzuela will now look to get back in the win column when he faces Torres, who has fought all but one of his career bouts in his native Mexico.\nThat lone fight in the United States was also Torres' lone professional loss, a 2023 TKO defeat against Raymond Muratalla. That loss has aged well as Muratalla has gone on to become the current IBF lightweight champion.\nTorres has rebounded from the Muratalla loss with four consecutive wins, including two by stoppage.There are other notable names on the three-fight main card, including former WBC interim junior middleweight champion Serhii Bohachuk taking on Radzhab Butaev, who is a former WBA \"regular\" welterweight champion, and former WBC light heavyweight champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk facing former world title challenger Radzhab Butaev.Let's take a look at the odds for each bout as well as how you can catch the action on Sunday before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\nZuffa Boxing 02 fight card, oddsOdds via DraftKings SportsbookJose Valenzuela -800 vs. Diego Torres +500, lightweightsSerhii Bohachuk -175 vs. Radzhab Butaev +140, middleweightsOleksandr Gvozdyk -550 vs. Radivoje Kalajdzic +380, light heavyweightsWhere to watch Zuffa Boxing 02Date: Feb. 1 | Location: Meta APEX -- Las VegasPrelims begin at 6 p.m. ETMain card begins at 9 p.m. ETWatch live: Paramount+ (subscribe now for just $8.99 per month)PredictionAs mentioned, Torres' lone career loss came against the best fighter he has fought and in the United States. The fight with Valenzuela is very similar for Torres. Like Muratalla, Valenzuela is considerably better than the rest of the fighters on Torres' resume. And Torres is having to come to America again to take on another big challenge. This should be a chance for Valenzuela to get off to a solid start in his Zuffa Boxing debut. Pick: Jose Valenzuela via TKO5\n            ",

The 10 starter picks were announced two weeks ago ahead of All-Star Weekend (Feb. 13-15) at Intuit Dome in Los Angeles. The game will feature a brand-new USA vs. The World format.LeBron James has secured a spot on the 2026 All-Star roster as a reserve, extending his record streak to 22 consecutive All-Star selections. Despite turning 41 in December, James has continued to put up impressive numbers, averaging 21.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 7.4 assists in 30 games played. NBA coaches pick reserves in each conference, and put LeBron on the West team ahead of other possible selections like Kawhi Leonard and Alperen Sengun.Rounding out the Western Conference All-Star reserves is a mix of established stars and rising talent, highlighted by Anthony Edwards, Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, along with first-time selections Jamal Murray and Chet Holmgren. On the Eastern Conference side, the reserves feature a blend of proven veterans and emerging players, including Donovan Mitchell, Karl-Anthony Towns and Pascal Siakam, with newcomers Jalen Duren and Jalen Johnson among those making their first All-Star appearances. Eastern Conference All-Star reservesDonovan Mitchell, CavaliersJalen Johnson, HawksKarl-Anthony Towns, KnicksPascal Siakam, PacersNorman Powell, HeatScottie Barnes, RaptorsJalen Duren, PistonsWestern Conference All-Star reserversAnthony Edwards, TimberwolvesJamal Murray, NuggetsChet Holmgren, ThunderKevin Durant, RocketsDevin Booker, SunsDeni Avdija, Trail BlazersLeBron James, LakersThe NBA is debuting a dramatically reworked All-Star Game format in 2026 by shifting to a USA vs. The World layout, replacing the traditional East vs. West matchup on the court. The event will feature three eight-player teams in total -- two made up of American players and one international squad -- competing in a round-robin tournament of 12-minute games.\nWhile the game format is new, the selection process remained the same to get this initial list of 24 All-Stars. Fans, players and media still voted to choose the All-Star starters from each conference, with seven bench players added per conference based on coach voting. One key change in voting is the removal of backcourt and frontcourt labels, allowing voters to simply select the best players regardless of position.To make the new format work, the league has roster minimums: at least 16 American players and eight international players must be selected, with commissioner Adam Silver authorized to add players if needed. Towns (Dominican Republic) and Powell (Jamaica) are both American-born players who have played for other countries internationally. But if they're both on American teams at the 2026 All-Star Game, that would leave eight other international players: Dončić, Jokić, Wembanyama, Antetokounmpo, Gilgeous-Alexander, Murray, Siakam and Avdija. Antetokounmpo, who has been part of rampant trade speculation recently, will likely miss the 2026 ASG after hurting his calf last weekend.\n2026 NBA All-StarsWestern ConferenceEastern ConferenceLuka Dončić, Lakers*Tyrese Maxey, 76ers*Stephen Curry, Warriors*Jalen Brunson, Knicks*Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder*Cade Cunningham, Pistons*Nikola Jokić, Nuggets*Jaylen Brown, Celtics*Victor Wembanyama, Spurs*Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks*Anthony Edwards, TimberwolvesDonovan Mitchell, CavaliersJamal Murray, NuggetsJalen Johnson, HawksChet Holmgren, ThunderKarl-Anthony Towns, KnicksKevin Durant, RocketsPascal Siakam, PacersDevin Booker, SunsNorman Powell, HeatDeni Avdija, Trail BlazersScottie Barnes, RaptorsLeBron James, LakersJalen Duren, Pistons* recognized as NBA All-Star starter\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Florida coach Todd Golden responded to a question about Charles Bediako's eligibilty at Alabama 10 days ago by saying the Gators were \"gonna beat 'em anyways.\" Golden, it turns out, was right.Florida made quick work of the Crimson Tide in Gainesville in a 100-77 victory Sunday as his team made him look prescient with a dominant showing in the paint and efficient triple-digit scoring. The win gives No. 19 Florida -- 11-2 in its last 13 outings after a rocky 5-4 start to the season -- a fifth consecutive win over No. 23 Alabama under Golden.Golden said he meant no disrespect about the \"we're gonna beat 'em anyways\" comment, but it nonetheless became a central storyline to Sunday's game that juiced up an already-electric matchup. Alabama coach Nate Oats didn't have much to say about that specific comment in the lead-up to the game, but he did make a curious comment about Florida's offensive rebounding success, saying earlier in the week: \"When you can sit in the lane for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 seconds at a time, it helps you offensively.\" \nPostgame, Golden had more to say, indirectly but not subtly commenting about the time his bigs were in the paint.\"Our bigs were in the paint for one second, two seconds, three seconds and scored,\" Golden said.Perhaps both coaches contributed meaningfully to the bulletin board material, but Florida was the team that backed up the talk. Fittingly, it scored a whopping 72 points in the paint in the win -- five shy of Alabama did in the entire game -- and it outrebounded the Tide 44-33, to boot.\n\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Texas A&M sits in first place of SEC with showdown vs. Alabama up next\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBediako, whose controversial eligibility started the back-and-forth between Oats and Golden, played 24 mostly forgettable minutes in which he added six points and seven rebounds and eventually fouled out. Seemingly, the fodder he provided in the run-up to Sunday's game and the juice fans brought to an electric O'Dome were his biggest contributions.\nIt was Florida's frontcourt which did the heavy lifting impacting the final outcome: Alex Condon (25 points and seven rebounds), Thomas Haugh (22 points and five rebounds) and Reuben Chinyelu (14 points and 17 rebounds) were tremendous in the win. And Boogie Fland added 15 points and eight assists leading the team's backcourt.\nAs right as things went for Florida was as wrong as things went for Alabama. Despite making 14 3-pointers on 34 attempts, it lost the turnover battle 18-2, was outscored 25-0 on points off turnovers and was bludgeoned in the painted area -- much like it has been all season. \nFlorida became the first SEC team in the last 20 seasons to score 70 or more paint points vs. a major-conference opponent. In doing so, it scored its third-most total points in a game this season and finished with more paint points (72) than total points it scored this season in losses to Duke (67-66) and Auburn (76--67).\n            ",

    "body": "\nFrom NFL player props to Patriots vs. Seahawks (-4.5) picks against the spread, to over/under picks (45.5), to money-line picks (Seahawks -230, Patriots +190), your 2026 Super Bowl parlay can go in a number of different directions. Another option is guessing the margin of victory of the game, and there's an NFL betting trend that could help in that regard. Entering Super Bowl LX, three of the last four editions of The Big Game have been decided by exactly 3 points. So, you could back the game's winning margin to be exactly 3 points in a 2026 Super Bowl SGP, which would return +475.Seattle winning by 3 points has +950 NFL prop odds, while New England doing the same carries +1100 odds. You could also make NFL bets on winning bands, with Seattle prevailing by 1-6 points at +275. But if you want to increase your potential winnings exponentially, then you could string one of these wagers with others into a lucrative Super Bowl same-game parlay. There are countless 2026 Super Bowl picks with plus-money payouts you can target, from alternate lines to anytime TD scorers to exact score predictions. Before making any Super Bowl 60 picks and NFL parlays, you need to see the epic Super Bowl LX same game parlay from SportsLine's proven model that pays out $15,000 on just a $10 bet.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Despite ranking 68th amongst wideouts in catches (33) in the regular season, Boutte was 18th in positional receiving touchdowns (6). He added another score in the Divisional Round and then got a redzone target in the AFC Title Game. While Seattle has an elite defense, through the air is where to exploit that unit. Eight of the last 10 touchdowns the Seahawks have allowed have been via the pass, including all three they gave up in the NFC Title Game.Boutte has more touchdowns this season than the Pats leading receiver, Stefon Diggs, despite the latter having twice as many targets and receptions. The model projects Boutte to score 0.31 touchdowns, which is the highest amongst all Patriots and brings great value to these plus-money odds as one leg of a Super Bowl SGP. See the rest of the picks in the Super Bowl LX same game parlay here, and you can bet Boutte as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $15,000The parlay also includes three additional Super Bowl picks from SportsLine's NFL model, including a must-see first NFL touchdown-scorer prop that pays out 25-1.

For the first time in the history of The Big Game, each team ranks in the top four in both scoring offense and scoring defense, providing a balanced Super Bowl 60 matchup. New England (14-3) went on the road to defeat Denver, 10-7, in the AFC Championship Game, while Seattle (14-3) held off the Rams, 31-27, to claim the NFC Title Game. The 2026 Super Bowl is a rematch from 11 years ago when the Pats prevailed 28-24 to win Super Bowl XLIX. New England quarterback Drake Maye didn't practice on Friday due to an illness. Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. ET from Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The Seahawks are 11-9 all-time versus New England. Seattle is the 4.5-point favorite in the latest Seahawks vs. Patriots   odds from DraftKings Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points is 45.5, with the Over slightly favored at -112 and the Under a -108.

They enter Super Bowl LX with a 16-1 record over their last 17 games, which is not a record that even Seattle can measure up to. New England has incredible balance, ranking second in points scored and fourth in points allowed, with the offense specifically standing out. Drake Maye combines both efficiency with a big-play ability as he leads the league in both completion percentage and yards per pass attempt. Meanwhile, the defense is playing its best entering Super Bowl Sunday as New England has given up one or fewer touchdowns in each of its last five games. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverIt's hard to find any holes with Seattle, including in regard to the spread, as it has both the most covers and the best cover percentage of the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are the only NFL team to rank in the top three in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and just five teams had more takeaways in the regular season. Mike Macdonald's crew also boasts top-10 rankings on both the ground and thru the air, but the defense is the star of this team. Seattle leads the NFL in points allowed, third-down defense, yards per rush allowed and yards per pass attempt allowed while ranking second in yards per play given up and rushing touchdowns allowed. No. 1 scoring defenses, like what Seattle has, also have a great history in this game, with a 14-4 all-time Super Bowl record. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Seahawks vs. Patriots picksSportsLine's model has simulated Patriots vs. Seahawks 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 44 combined points.

With a few notable-name free agents and trade candidates still on the board even at this increasingly late hour, there's a daily supply of rumors. Speaking of which, you can find Sunday's roundup just below. White Sox acquire Hicks from Boston\nThe Boston Red Sox have traded right-hander Jordan Hicks and right-handed pitching prospect David Sandlin to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for right-handed pitching prospect Gage Ziehl and a player to be named, ESPN and MassLive.com report. Hicks, 29, is one of the hardest throwers in baseball, and he has experience as both a reliever and a starting pitcher. Last season, he pitched to a 6.95 ERA and an FIP of 4.35 in a combined 67 ⅓ innings for the Red Sox and Giants. For his career, he has an ERA+ of 91 across parts of seven MLB seasons. Over that span, Hicks has made 37 starts and 238 relief appearances. He's under contract through the 2027 season and is owed $12.5 million for each of the next two seasons. The White Sox will be picking up the majority of Hicks' remaining commitment. As for Sandlin, he turns 25 on Feb. 21, and he's a former 11th-rounder out of the University of Oklahoma. He was originally drafted by the Royals. Sandlin has a 4.38 ERA in four minor league seasons -- 47 starts and 18 relief appearances -- with 279 strikeouts in 232 innings as a pro. He reached the Triple-A level in 2025. \nThe 22-year-old Ziehl, a fourth-rounder in 2024 out of the University of Miami, has an ERA of 4.12 and a K/BB ratio of 4.74 in his lone minor league season. He made 22 starts and one relief appearance. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Serie A match between Cremonese and Inter was temporarily stopped after a firecracker thrown from the away fans section of the Stadio Giovanni Zini exploded next to goalkeeper Emil Audero. The game was stopped for around three minutes at the 48th minute as the Cremonese player was assisted by the physios and was able to continue playing against his former team. Audero, who played for Inter during the 2023-24 season and moved to Cremonese in the summer of 2025, faced moments of fear when the firecracker ended up near him, but luckily, he appeared to come away uninjured.\nInter were fortunate, because had the match been suspended, the Nerazzurri could have been handed a 3–0 defeat, as has happened in similar cases in the past. However, since Audero was able to resume play, that scenario was avoided. Inter captain Lautaro Martinez and the Nerazzurri manager Cristian Chivu immediately went close to the away section, and tried to calm things down a bit as it remains unclear the reason behind the shameful gesture.\nSpeaking to DAZN after the game, Lautaro Martinez spoke on the matter, saying, \"These things should never happen. We are footballers, and you put a person's safety at risk. An apology is owed to Audero, a champion of the second star, and to the Cremonese supporters.\" Inter Presidente Giuseppe Marotta said to Sky Italy, \"Sport has values that are truly far removed from what we witnessed. The authorities are carrying out investigations into what was an isolated act, and what I think is shared by all Inter supporters: football must be completely removed from such incidents. We condemn it in the strongest possible terms, and we also thank Audero for his professionalism. The authorities will identify those responsible; the condemnation from the entire Inter club for what happened is explicit and total. A truly senseless act.\"\nInter won 2-0 against Cremonese thanks to the goals scored by Lautaro Martinez and Piotr Zielinski in the first half, and the Nerazzurri are now leading the Serie A standings by eight points over AC Milan, who will face Bologna on Tuesday at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara. \n            ",

The Roos are playing out the string this season under departing coach Marvin Menzies; the school announced in January that it was moving on from Menzies' four-year run at season's end. Kansas City, which is 4-18 and ranks near the bottom of Division I this season, made the move official and announced Turgeon's hiring Sunday afternoon.Turgeon, who turns 61 on Feb. 5, has a 479-275 record across 23 and a half seasons. He began his career at Jacksonville State, then Turgeon upped his profile in a seven-year stint at Wichita State, including a 2006 Sweet 16 appearance. From 2007-11, Turgeon ran Texas A&M's program and took the Aggies to four straight NCAA Tournaments. That landed him his biggest job: Maryland. Turgeon had an NCAA Tournament-level team in six of his nine full seasons in College Park, though he only took the Terrapins to the Big Dance five times due to his 24-7 team not getting a chance to play in the canceled 2020 NCAA Tournament. He took over the Terps in 2011, lasting a little more than a decade. Turgeon resigned from his post at Maryland on Dec. 3, 2021, amid a rocky start and toxic situation with the fan base.\nA little more than four years removed from roaming the sidelines, Turgeon is hopping back into the profession. He does so in surprising fashion by heading to the Summit League level; it's conceivable Turgeon could have landed a bigger job in March, when dozens more will inevitably come available. Turgeon has ties to the area: He played at Kansas in the 1980s and grew up in Topeka, Kansas. A source said that Turgeon will bring his son, Will, on staff as well.Kansas City AD Brandon Martin made a significant push on Turgeon in the past two weeks (and a source said it's not the first time he tried to court a former power-conference coach). Martin ultimately swayed Turgeon, and in doing so, the Roos will boast one of the most accomplished coaches at the mid-major level.\nKansas City (formerly UMKC) has been in Division I since the late 1980s but never made the NCAA Tournament. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Puerto Rico is considering withdrawing from the upcoming 2026 World Baseball Classic because insurance issues have struck at the heart of their proposed roster for the tournament. In all, at least eight players eligible to play for Puerto Rico -- including, most notably, Mets All-Star shortstop Francisco Lindor -- have not been approved to be insured for the WBC, which begins in March. In Lindor's case, the insurance provider for the WBC declined to cover his salary obligations because he's undergone a pair of elbow surgeries over the past three offseasons, the Athletic reports. Lindor, however, is expected to have a normal spring training with the Mets in advance of the 2026 Major League Baseball regular season, as the elbow procedure he underwent in October is considered to be minor. In addition to Lindor, Astros infielder Carlos Correa, Blue Jays right-hander José Berríos and Twins catcher Victor Caratini are among those not expected to be able to participate for Puerto Rico. As for the possibility of Puerto Rico withdrawing from the tournament, team operations manager Joey Sola said such a drastic step is \"on the table\" depending upon whether the team is able to find suitable roster replacements. Puerto Rico had been considered one of the favorites for the tournament, recently boasting the fourth-best odds (+1100 at DraftKings) behind the United States, Japan and the Dominican Republic.Here's more from Sola, via the Athletic: \n\"In some ways, I think it's a little bit unfair,\" Sola said. \"Especially when you are three days from submitting your final roster. Who in the world would think Lindor wasn't on the (eligible) list? You wait until the last weekend to get an answer on Lindor? C'mon.\"It took us by surprise. I know the WBC isn't in those decisions. It's the insurance companies. But you have guys on other teams, they have an injury history and then I got guys on my roster who will be playing at the Double-A level with no (major-league) guarantee, no MLB invitation (to spring training), and they get flagged. And guys on other teams who can play in the WBC are earning $30 million per year. It's kind of tough to understand it.\"Further complicating the issue is that Puerto Rico is scheduled to host pool play in San Juan's Hiram Bithorn Stadium from March 6 to March 11. WBC team rosters are set to be finalized by Tuesday. Former All-Star catcher Yadier Molina is set to manage Puerto Rico in the WBC. Insurance policies, which are provided by a league-approved insurer, cover a player's salary for multiple seasons in the event of an injury during the WBC. The underwriting process for those policies has become more exacting following the injuries suffered by Jose Altuve and Edwin Díaz during the most recent WBC in 2023, according to the Athletic. As well, such WBC policies are no longer being extended to players who are age 37 or older, ESPN reports. \nPuerto Rico has long been a baseball power on the international scene and finished as runner-up in the WBC in both 2017 and 2013. As for the 2026 tournament, the United States is widely regarded as the favorites going in with a roster that includes the likes of Aaron Judge, Bobby Witt Jr., Tarik Skubal, Paul Skenes, and others. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Justin Jefferson did not hesitate when asked the quiet part out loud when it relates to the Minnesota Vikings and their quarterbacks. Could this have been the Vikings in the Super Bowl if Sam Darnold stayed?\"Yeah, for sure. Definitely,\" Jefferson said in a recent interview with USA Today.It was an honest answer, and one that now lands differently in Minnesota, where the Vikings are coming off a 9-8 season, missed the playoffs and the stunning firing of general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah, just months after a contract extension.Darnold, meanwhile, is preparing to play in Super Bowl LX in his first season with the Seattle Seahawks.\nJefferson's comments were not necessarily a shot at Minnesota's current quarterback room. Instead, they reflected the reality of a season that unraveled after the Vikings chose not to re-sign the quarterback who had helped guide them to a 14-3 record in 2024.Darnold arrived in Minnesota as a temporary solution while the organization waited on first-round pick J.J. McCarthy's recovery from a knee injury. When McCarthy went down for the year, Darnold delivered the best season of his career, throwing for more than 4,300 yards and 35 touchdowns and leading one of the most productive offenses in the league.The long-term plan, however, never changed. Minnesota turned the offense over to McCarthy in 2025, and the results were uneven. McCarthy's injuries and inconsistency pressed veteran Carson Wentz and rookie Max Brosmer into action, and the Vikings' offense fell from ninth in scoring to 26th. Minnesota ended the regular season on a five-game win streak, but narrowly missed out on the playoffs.\nSeattle took the opposite path. The Seahawks signed Darnold to a three-year deal, watched him earn another Pro Bowl nod and rode a balanced roster to a franchise-record 14 wins and a Super Bowl berth.For Jefferson, the difference was familiarity and stability -- something the Vikings rarely had under center in 2025.\"Everyone knows the difficulty of the quarterback position this year, of how we were dealt it,\" Jefferson said. \"But having a quarterback that already had a season under his belt with us, knew the plays, knew the playbook, knew the players -- throwing to me, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson, all these guys -- I definitely feel like we would have done better. But it is what it is. It's on to new and better things, but I'm definitely happy and proud for him that he was able to reach it this year.\"\nWatching Darnold reach the Super Bowl has stirred conflicting emotions for Jefferson, who admitted it hasn't been easy seeing another team enjoy the success Minnesota hoped to chase.\"It's definitely tough. It's tough to watch,\" Jefferson said. \"I love that he's in the Super Bowl. I'm happy for him, I want nothing but the best for him, especially the way his journey was at first, people doubting him and people not giving him the respect. Now they're giving him the respect. Now they're seeing that he's a top-tier quarterback in this league. Of course, selfishly I wish he had done that for us last year, but to see him blossom and bounce back right after last year and make it this year, I'm happy for him and I hope he wins.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This is a tough weekend for many sports fans, as it is the first weekend without pro or college football since last summer. And while there is still one football game left next Sunday -- just a small little one, you probably haven't heard of -- this Sunday's schedule might look a little bit empty. But don't fear, there is no need to go outside or spend quality time with friends and family, because there's enough phenomenal women's college basketball on tap to keep you firmly planted on the couch. In fact, it is such a phenomenal lineup I'm dubbing it \"Super Sunday.\"We've got three historic rivalry games on tap, including the legendary UConn vs. Tennessee game and two regional showdowns between Michigan and Michigan State and Oklahoma and Texas. We've also got battles for supremacy in the Big Ten and Big 12. \n        \n            \n                Takeaways: After USC loss, Iowa looks to Hannah Stuelke as its X factor heading into Big Ten showdown vs. UCLA\n                \n                    Isabel Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt might not be March yet, but Sunday is the first day of February, and it looks like the madness is ready to begin a month early. Keep reading for the must-watch games and most pressing questions heading into these marquee matchups. The must-watch gamesTwenty of the top 25 teams are playing on Sunday and there are a staggering seven games between ranked teams. While you can check out the full women's college hoops schedule on Sunday here, and there are plenty of great match-ups involving teams outside the top 25, these seven are must-watch games, so get multiple screens ready.\nNo. 1 UConn vs. No. 15 Tennessee; 12 pm ET; Fox/fuboNo. 24 Alabama vs. No 6 LSU; 12 pm; SEC Network/fuboNo. 9 Michigan vs. No. 13 Michigan State; 12 pm; FS1/fuboNo. 14 Baylor vs. No. 22 West Virginia; 1 pm; ESPN/fuboNo. 12 TCU vs. No. 21 Texas Tech; 2 pm; FS1/fuboNo. 10 Oklahoma vs. No. 4 Texas; 3 pm; ABC/fuboNo. 8 Iowa vs. No. 2 UCLA; 4 pm; Fox/fuboThe burning questions1. Will Tennessee spoil UConn's perfect season?The No. 1 UConn Huskies are the lone undefeated team in women's college basketball, and given they have the best player in the country in Sarah Strong and the Big East only has two other teams ranked in the top 50 in NET rankings -- Villanova at 38 and Seton Hall at 48 -- it is unlikely they get tested at all in conference play. That means their biggest hurdle before the NCAA Tournament will come from their final nonconference game against No. 15 Tennessee on Sunday. The Lady Vols are 14-4 on the season and an impressive 6-1 in SEC play. Kim Caldwell's team is much faster and more physical than any team in the Big East, and the Lady Vols' defense has been potent in the last month -- they've held SEC opponents below 60 points in four of the last six games. Plus, Tennessee actually beat UConn last season, 80-76. But while that game was in Knoxville, this one is in Hartford, Connecticut, and the Huskies have reached a new level since then -- their last loss before their current 38-game winning streak.This is, of course, a historic rivalry in women's basketball, dating back to the days when the late Pat Summitt and Auriemma battled yearly for supremacy and took the sport to new heights. While UConn is the heavy favorite in this one, it's worth tuning in to see how they handle a team of Tennessee's ilk.\n2. Can Texas keep pace with the contenders?Out of all the great games this Sunday, our Isabel Gonzalez picked this one as her must-watch of the weekend, and it is not hard to see why. No. 10 Oklahoma has the front-runner for freshman of the year, Aaliyah Chavez, and No. 4 Texas has one of the best players in the nation, Madison Booker, and is a team with national championship hopes.The Sooners have been ranked as high as No. 5 this season before hitting a rough stretch in mid-January, dropping three straight games to then-No. 18 Ole Miss, then-No. 6 Kentucky and then-No. 6 LSU. But Oklahoma turned around the skid in emphatic fashion, upsetting then-No. 2 South Carolina last Thursday, and has notched two more wins since. An upset over Texas would go a long way toward securing Oklahoma a top 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament.But, in my opinion, Texas faces the most pressure in this game. Every team in the SEC will take its lumps, but since the Longhorns lost back-to-back games to then-No. 6 LSU and then-No. 3 Texas, legitimate questions have emerged about whether this team has enough offensive firepower and ball security to make it back to the Final Four. A loss to Oklahoma would only exacerbate those concerns and put Vic Schaefer's team in rocky waters at the beginning of a string of five straight games in 15 days against ranked opponents -- after Sunday, Texas faces No. 6 LSU, No. 18 Kentucky, No. 5 Vanderbilt and No. 15 Tennessee.\nAll season, last year's Final Four teams of UConn, South Carolina, UCLA and Texas have held onto the top four spots in the rankings and have been the favorites to make it to Phoenix. But a loss to Oklahoma would put Texas in danger of losing a No. 1 seed and falling back in the pack.3. Is UCLA ready to take full control of the Big Ten?So, this was supposed to be a battle of the undefeated teams in conference play, but No. 8 Iowa stumbled before it got to the finish line when it laid an egg against a feisty USC team on Thursday night. Still, these are the top two teams in the Big Ten and Sunday's game at Pauley Pavilion should be electric. Will Hannah Stuelke be the X factor Iowa needs to get the upset and make the Big Ten a true competition? Or will Gabriela Jaquez's shooting and leadership help No. 2 UCLA distance itself from the rest of the Big Ten? It should be fun to find out. 4. Are any of the top Big 12 teams elite?I'll be honest: I did not think the Big 12 would be so entertaining this season, but it has certainly made me look foolish for my low expectations. I thought No. 12 TCU would run away with it, and figured if anyone challenged the Horned Frogs, it would be Iowa State. However, as I covered in my article on the biggest disappointments of the season, the Cyclones stumbled out of the gate in Big 12 play and while TCU still sits atop the standings, it has looked far from unstoppable.\nRight now, the top four teams in the standings are TCU (20-2 overall; 8-1 conference), No. 14 Baylor (19-3, 8-1), No. 21 Texas Tech (20-3, 7-3) and No. 22 West Virginia (17-5, 7-3). On Sunday, we will see these four teams face each other. Can Texas Tech get its season back on track and upset TCU? Will Baylor be able to keep pace with TCU -- or even take over the top spot, depending on what TCU does -- by staving off a gritty West Virginia squad? I'm hoping Sunday provides some clarity amidst the chaos and shows whether TCU and Baylor are ready to establish themselves firmly as the top dogs of the conference or if West Virginia and Texas Tech are going to fight to stay in the mix.5. Who is the top team in Michigan? Michigan vs. Michigan State is a historic rivalry, but the women's basketball version has never held much significance outside of the state. But this year, the entire country should be tuned in. No. 9 Michigan is ranked in the top 10 for the 10th straight week, the longest streak in program history, and No. 13 Michigan State is at its highest ranking since 2010. It is the first time in the rivalry's history that both teams have been ranked in the top 15, and the second time they've both been ranked in the top 25, with the first occurring just one year ago. The two teams sit third and fourth in the ultra-competitive Big Ten, just behind UCLA and Iowa, so this game won't just be for in-state pride; it will have a real impact on conference standings and on earning a top-16 seed come March. They'll play twice in the next couple of weeks, with this one taking place in East Lansing.\nWhile there are plenty of talented players in this one, I'll be keeping an eye on the versatile star sophomore guards on each team – Kenendy Blair for the Spartans and Syla Swords and Olivia Olson for the Wolverines. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 coaching carousel is finally filled, as the Arizona Cardinals have decided on their new lead man. The Cardinals plan to hire former Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur as their new coach, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports. LaFleur is staying in the NFC West, and has served as Sean McVay's top offensive lieutenant for the last three years. The younger brother of Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur has coached in the NFL for over a decade. After interning with the Cleveland Browns in 2014 and then serving as an offensive assistant with the Atlanta Falcons for two seasons, Lafleur had the opportunity to work as the passing game coordinator and wide receivers coach with the San Francisco 49ers for four years. He then followed Robert Saleh to New York, and ran the Jets' offense for two seasons.Los Angeles boasted the top offense in the NFL this past season, averaging 394.6 total yards per game, and a league-leading 30.5 points scored per game as well. Veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford is the favorite to win MVP, as he led the NFL in passing touchdowns (46), passing yards (4,707) and TD-INT ratio (46-8). Only two other quarterbacks have ever thrown 45 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single season, the others being Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. Stafford had plenty of help, however, as wide receiver Davante Adams led the league with 14 receiving touchdowns, while Puka Nacua led the NFL with 129 receptions and 107.2 receiving yards per game. \nRams with Mike LaFleur as offensive coordinatorCategoryStatisticNFL RankWin percentage.627T-6thPoints per game25.36thYards per play5.76thTotal yards per game361.8 6thPassing yards per game244.95thLaFleur replaces Jonathan Gannon, who was fired after a 3-14 season. The Cardinals are the only team to lose at least 13 games in three out of the last four seasons, and are 19-49 since 2022 -- which is tied with the Tennessee Titans for the worst record in the NFL in that span. Gannon went 15-36 in his three seasons as lead man, and recently joined the Packers to be their new defensive coordinator. In Arizona, LaFleur will have access to one of the best tight ends in the NFL in Trey McBride, who just caught 126 passes for 1,239 yards and 11 touchdowns this season, and a former No. 4 overall pick at wide receiver in Marvin Harrison Jr., who has registered 103 receptions for 1,493 yards and 12 touchdowns in his first 29 career games played. The Cardinals also have one of the most underrated wide receivers in the NFL with Michael Wilson, who crossed 115 yards receiving three different times this year. \nWhile there are some pieces in place, the Cardinals have plenty of questions to answer this offseason. No question looms larger than what Arizona will do at quarterback. Kyler Murray played just five games in 2025 due to a foot injury. Jacoby Brissett replaced him in the lineup, and was unquestionably more efficient. Murray is under contract through at least 2027, but it's possible the Cardinals could part ways with him this offseason. The former No. 1 overall pick has seen his production dip since 2021. He ranks 26th in win percentage and 29th in yards per attempt among the 33 quarterbacks with 25 or more starts since 2022, and has played 12 games just once over the last four seasons. Arizona hasn't won a playoff game since 2015, and has made the postseason just once since then.\n            ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        The San Francisco 49ers are expected to hire Raheem Morris as their defensive coordinator, per CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Morris was fired as Atlanta Falcons coach following the end of the 2025 season. He replaces Robert Saleh after Saleh took the Tennessee Titans' coaching job.Morris, 49, went 8-9 in both seasons in his most recent stint in Atlanta. He also served as an interim coach there in 2020 and also coached the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2009-11. Overall, he has a 37-56 record as a head coach.However, Morris has an extensive background as a defensive coach, including as the Los Angeles Rams' defensive coordinator from 2021-23, a stretch that included a Super Bowl victory. He was also the Falcons' defensive coordinator in 2020 before taking over as interim coach.\nMorris broke into the NFL in 2022 with the Buccaneers as a defensive quality control coach and rose to defensive backs coach before he was hired as head coach at just 32 years old. After three years in that role, he joined Washington as the secondary coach, where he was on the same staff as current 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan. Morris and Shanahan were also on the same staff in Atlanta in 2015 and 2016, when Morris worked on both sides of the ball and Shanahan was the offensive coordinator.The 49ers struggled defensively in 2025, but many of those struggles can be attributed to injuries. Nick Bosa (ACL) and Fred Warner (ankle) both missed double-digit games, and first-round rookie Mykel Williams only played roughly half the season after tearing his ACL. The 49ers still managed to make the playoffs, where they beat the Philadelphia Eagles before losing to the Seattle Seahawks.\nSan Francisco had one of the NFL's least-productive pass rushes, something that will certainly be an area of focus for Morris. San Francisco spent each of its first five picks in 2025 on defenders, and their development will be crucial.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        With the topic of illegal eye pokes fresh on the mind of most in mixed martial arts following last weekend's aborted heavyweight title bout between Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane, Saturday's co-main event at UFC Fight Night in Las Vegas couldn't have played out in a more bizarre and unprecedented manner. Heavyweight contender Waldo Cortes-Acosta went from nearly losing his bout against Ante Delija by first-round TKO inside the UFC Apex despite absorbing a poke to the eye, to having the fight restarted after referee Mark Smith consulted instant replay. Merely seconds later, after uncorking a monstrous, looping right hand that caught Delija flush and floored him, Cortes-Acosta was celebrating an unlikely knockout victory of his own. Cortes-Acosta (15-2) improved to 6-1 over his last seven fights by successfully rebounding from a decision loss to Sergei Pavlovich in August. But the 34-year-old native of the Dominican Republic only pulled off the dramatic stoppage by choosing to keep fighting despite an errant left hand from Delija that scraped his left eye in a similar manner to what Gane did to Aspinall at UFC 321, which caused the fight to be ruled a no contest late in Round 1. \"I feel the finger going inside my eye. The referee said to stop it. I decided to continue because I felt that I could continue,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"My eyes were like 20% vision but I said I don't give a f---.\"\nThe irony of the situation is that Delija (26-7) is a teammate of Aspinall and criticized Gane this week at media day by saying, \"I had 33 fights and never poked someone in the eye. And I do believe the punishment for that should be severe.\"Delija's illegal poke was initially not seen by Smith. Cortes-Acosta covered up and absorbed a series of hard strikes from the knockout puncher that forced Smith to jump in and seemingly wave off the fight. Seconds later, everyone from cageside doctors to the cutmen and coaches from both teams entered the Octagon. But after instant replay was consulted following a long break, the fight was restarted. The dramatic knockout win from Cortes-Acosta came just moments later at 3:59 of the round after he dropped Delija with a single punch and attempted to follow up with ground strikes until Smith leaped in to stop the bout. \n\"Yeah, I'm mad. I'm Dominican. This is in my blood, from birth,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"This is what happens. I come in like that every f---ing time and anyone that doesn't come in f---ing shape, I f--- him up like that.\"Delija, a 35-year-old from Croatia, is a former PFL tournament champion who made an explosive UFC debut in September when he knocked out Marcin Tybura just over two minutes into the fight. But it was Cortes-Acosta who now moves forward in a noticeably shallow division.\"I want to tell you something, Aspinall, you see that fight, no? I'm going for you,\" Cortes-Acosta said. \"Be ready, OK? Be ready.\n\"It's exciting for me. For my last fight, I pressured too much. That Russian guy [Pavlovich] got my f---ing victory and took my f---ing five straight [win streak]. I want to come back and beat the champ of the world and f--- him up, too.\" \n            ",

Miguel Rojas hit a game-tying home run in the ninth and Will Smith hit a go-ahead home run in the 11th. Yoshinobu Yamamoto got the final eight outs one day after throwing six innings in Game 6. That earned him World Series MVP honors.Before L.A.'s late-inning comeback, future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer walked off the field to a standing ovation, having fired 4 ⅓ innings of one-run ball. That performance will ultimately go down as a footnote. After Game 7, the 41-year-old Scherzer reiterated that he has no immediate plans to retire, and expects to continue pitching in 2026.\"I think I'll give a full answer on that later,\" Scherzer said when asked about retirement after Game 7. \"But I will say this: I just don't see how that's the last pitch I've ever thrown.\"\nThis season marked Scherzer's 18th in the majors, a legendary career that has included two World Series rings, three Cy Young awards, eight All-Star nods.Scherzer limped to the finish in the regular season, pitching to a 9.00 ERA with eight home runs allowed in 25 innings in his final six starts. He pitched well in the postseason though, authoring a 3.77 ERA in three starts. Scherzer doesn't pitch deep into games these days, but he can still be effective in the innings he does pitch.\nPitching is always in demand, so, if Scherzer does want to pitch in 2026, a team will surely offer him a contract, likely a contender. He's still a viable mid-to-back-end starter and he's also a great clubhouse presence. For now, Scherzer and the Blue Jays will regroup following the Game 7 loss, and figure out 2026 later.\n            \n    ",

A year after their shock elimination to Atlanta United in the opening round, the Herons will go to a decisive Game 3 for a second straight year in their opening series, this time facing Nashville SC. Inter Miami fell 2-1 in Game 2 on Saturday night in Tennessee.A 3-1 win in Game 1 saw all the momentum shift to Lionel Messi and company after the Argentine scored two goals. But with the rain coming down in Nashville, a slow start doomed Javier Mascherano's side, who gave the hosts a penalty kick within the first 10 minutes and conceded again right before halftime. Messi, who just signed a contract extension with the club, did scored a late consolation goal, but it won't matter ahead of their Friday night meeting in Fort Lauderdale for Game 3.Both teams finished with 10 shots, with Nashville putting five on target. Inter Miami put four of theirs on target and completed 226 more passes than the hosts, who defended well with their physicality and were able to see out the game with patience passing and quality spacing, not letting Miami's aging attackers to do much.\nAnother first-round elimination would mean a serious blow to the Herons' plans and Mascherano's tenure as coach, having fully expected to claim an MLS Cup this season with their high-powered attack, boosted by the summer addition of Argentina international Rodrigo de Paul. Last season, the club moved on from Tata Martino shortly after the loss to Atlanta United. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        We now have the complete career resume when it comes to the all-time great career of Dodgers legend Clayton Kershaw. He ends his 18-season career with three World Series rings after the Dodgers staged an all-time great comeback in Game 7 of the 2025 World Series. Kershaw was in the bullpen but didn't see action, other than the celebrating, of course. Kershaw did plenty throughout his career to merit three rings, of course. He won three Cy Youngs and an MVP. He made the All-Star team 11 times. He won five ERA titles. His numbers are staggering. He went 223-96 (his .699 winning percentage is the best ever in MLB post-integration) with a 2.53 ERA, 1.02 WHIP, 3,052 strikeouts against fewer than 700 unintentional walks in 2,855 ⅓ innings. I've previously noted that he could be ranked in the top 20 all-time pitchers and there's an argument that he's in the top five among left-handers ever. And now, he finishes with back-to-back World Series championships.\"I can't imagine a better way to go out,\" he said on the broadcast after the Game 7 victory.\nIn this World Series, Kershaw faced one batter. That's it. Just the one. You could still make an argument they don't win the series without him, however, because he entered in the 12th inning of Game 3 with the bases loaded. He induced a groundout to strand three runners and keep the game alive for the Dodgers. Now, any all-time great would probably prefer to go out while having two huge starts in the World Series or something like that, but Kershaw has been on fumes for a while, ravaged by a series of injuries including chronic back problems. He's known this was the end for a while.It's why he was a special selection for the All-Star Game -- because he knew this was it. \nSpeaking of, he got two outs in that Midsummer Classic without allowing a baserunner, even recording a strikeout. In the regular season this year, he was productive and helped the Dodgers fight through rotation issues for months. He was 11-2 with a 3.36 ERA in 112 ⅔ innings at age 37. He was also coming off foot and knee surgeries that he had last offseason. All in all, Kershaw's decision to rehab for one final season, knowing it was one last shot to finish on a high note, went very well. He had a good season, got a gigantic out in the World Series and ends up with another ring. \"How can I script it any better? That's the last time I'll ever get to play baseball,\" he said after Game 7.   \nAnd now, in five years, he'll get into the Baseball Hall of Fame with nearly -- if not all -- 100% of the vote. It certainly does sound like a very nice script for real life.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Dodgers right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto was named World Series Most Valuable Player on Saturday, just minutes after Los Angeles completed a comeback Game 7 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. In the process, the Dodgers both overcame a 3-2 deficit in the best-of-seven set, and became the first team since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees to repeat as Fall Classic winners.Yamamoto's performance was integral to the Dodgers' victory. He appeared three times in the seven games, starting Games 2 and 6 and then pitching out of the bullpen in Game 7 and closing out the victory. Manager Dave Roberts had initially ruled out Yamamoto from Game 7 consideration after Yamamoto threw 96 pitches on Friday night. Yet Yamamoto, the same mad hatter who had begun to warm on short rest during the 18-inning marathon Game 3, pushed back and changed Roberts' mind.In doing so, Yamamoto cemented his place in both Dodgers and MLB history -- at least along the likes of Randy Johnson, who closed out the 2001 World Series after throwing 104 pitches the night before, and Sandy Koufax, who threw multiple complete games on short rest during his heyday. Yamamoto, like Johnson most recently before him, earned three wins in the 2025 World Series. He also became the third pitcher since 1960 to start World Series Game 6 and then appear in Game 7, joining Johnson (2001) and Bob Friend (1960).\nYamamoto's accomplishments weren't just about his availability, but also his capacity for giving the Dodgers quality innings. He threw two complete games this postseason, including one in Game 2. In the World Series as a whole, he struck out 15 batters in 17 innings pitched. For the postseason, he made six appearances and tallied a 1.45 ERA. L.A. went 5-1 in his outings -- how could they not?. Here's a complete list of pitchers to win Games 6 and 7 of a World Series:2025: Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Los Angeles Dodgers2001: Randy Johnson, Arizona Diamondbacks1946: Harry Brecheen, St. Louis Cardinals1925: Ray Kremer, Pittsburgh PiratesThere's a tendency to flatten the Dodgers' success to their financial might. That's understandable, but it misses a key consideration: while they have several well-compensated players, including Yamamoto himself, they also employ players who are willing to put the \"we\" before the \"I.\" Whether that's Mookie Betts changing positions seemingly every six months, Will Klein becoming a minor folk hero by exceeding his comfort level during a lengthy World Series outing, or Yamamoto offering to pitch on short rest several times during the World Series to give the Dodgers the best chance at success.  Baseball, like any professional sport or billion-dollar industry for that matter, is full of outsized egos. Watching a player like Yamamoto put the team first lets you forget about that. At least for a little while.\nGame 7 is a great capper for Yamamoto, 27, and his second season in America. He joined the Dodgers prior to last year on a $325 million contract -- the largest in MLB history for a pitcher -- following one of the best pitching careers in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league career. In 30 regular season starts, he compiled a 2.49 ERA (167 ERA+) and a 3.41 strikeout-to-walk ratio. He was named to his first career MLB All-Star Game. By winning the World Series MVP, Yamamoto added another accomplishment: he became the first Japanese-born pitcher to ever win the World Series MVP Award. He's the second Japanese-born player to win it overall, joining longtime New York Yankees outfielder Hideki Matsui. Matsui won the award back in 2009 by homering three times and driving in eight runs as part of a victory against the Philadelphia Phillies.Eighteen months ago, fans might've been unaware of what Yamamoto was all about, or if he would find as much success in America. Now, he's done his part to answer those questions -- and to place his name in the history books.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After several close ACC wins this season for unbeaten Georgia Tech, the dam finally broke defensively during Saturday night's 48-36 loss at NC State, the second stunner in conference play to highlight Week 10 following SMU's overtime triumph over Miami.The Wolfpack had the Yellow Jackets on the ropes throughout the second half, countering every punch with uppercuts in the form of touchdowns of their own through red-hot quarterback CJ Bailey and a big-play offense playing without two of its top talents -- tailback Hollywood Smothers and tight end Justin Joly.NC State piled up 583 yards of total offense -- including a career-best 196 yards rushing from Duke Scott -- and sent Georgia Tech (8-1, 5-1) to a resounding first setback. Virginia (8-1, 5-0) is the ACC's lone remaining unbeaten in conference play and clinches a spot in the conference championship game with wins over Wake Forest, Duke (5-3, 4-1) and Virginia Tech to finish out the regular season.With Georgia Tech's unexpected loss, the ACC likely will not have a team inside the top 10 of the College Football Playoff Rankings when the selection committee unveils its first top 25 on Tuesday night unless the Hurricanes (6-2, 2-2) get the benefit of the doubt since they've posted three wins over ranked teams.\nLouisville (7-1, 4-1) and SMU each have one loss in conference play, but one of those two will be eliminated from reaching the title game when they meet on Nov. 22 in Dallas. That leaves one-loss Virginia and Duke, who play one another on Nov. 15, to try and fill the other side of the equation in the first weekend of December.The best Georgia Tech can finish is in a multi-team tie for first, and then it would come down to various tiebreakers under the ACC's policy, that was enacted in 2023 with conference expansion.With the selection committee's new strength of schedule metric set to debut this week, the ACC will be far lower than the SEC and Big Ten in the pecking order and likely the Big 12, as well. Virginia's lone ranked win this fall came against Florida State, while Georgia Tech beat Clemson for its quality win and Louisville beat Miami.\nThe ACC champion gets an automatic bid to the playoff, but those in the mix for one of seven available at-large spots will be battling against the likes of the SEC and Big Ten's runner-up, others within those leagues with double-digit victories and a potential 10-win Notre Dame. Best-case for a two-bid scenario for the ACC would be Georgia Tech beating Georgia in Atlanta during rivalry weekend, but losing the following weekend against one of these one-loss in conference challengers. That would mean the Yellow Jackets are 11-2 overall with a pair of ranked wins, and could let the chips fall where they may with the selection committee during at-large deliberations.SMU earned the ACC's second bid in last year's first year of expansion after losing its second game of the season to Clemson in the league title game, but this time around, it's going to take mass chaos the rest of the month outside of the conference to warrant inclusion for a league's second selection.\nThis is partly why ACC commissioner Jim Phillips was a strong advocate for further expansion over the summer, knowing his league was a bit top-heavy and needed strong showings from its preseason elites to get there. Instead, Clemson has flatlined, Florida State has struggled and Miami has lost two of its last three games after starting 6-0.There will be no microphone holding this time around for the conference it appears, unless much falls in the ACC's favor over the final weeks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Sherrone Moore's tenure as Michigan's coach has featured some incredible highs, most notably a pair of victories over hated rival Ohio State, but the Wolverines have also struggled to make themselves legitimate contenders in the Big Ten due to an offense that hasn't been up to par. Given Moore is an offensive coach, that's a considerable concern for Michigan fans who haven't been impressed by their output in big games. Their early road losses this season at Oklahoma and USC saw the Wolverines' offense sputter, scoring just 13 points in each contest. The 6-2 Wolverines won by 11 against arch-rival Michigan State last week and are currently in a dogfight with Purdue at home. Michigan is a 21.5-point favorite vs. Purdue. With star freshman Bryce Underwood now under center, the expectation for a more explosive passing attack hasn't materialized in their biggest games, and the temperature has steadily risen for Moore's seat in Ann Arbor. That hit a fever pitch on Saturday night when the Wolverines found themselves locked in a defensive struggle at home with a Purdue team that hasn't won a Big Ten game since 2023. Another poor offensive performance led to Wolverines fans wondering if it might be time to make a change, and the cost to do so wouldn't be anything close to what we've seen a number of other big programs shell out to get rid of a coach this season. Sherrone Moore buyout, contract detailsMoore's contract pays him $5.5 million in base salary and additional compensation annually, running through 2029 -- with a $500,000 retention bonus each season. His buyout is 75% of the base and additional compensation for the remainder of his contract. \nThat means if Moore was fired during the 2025 campaign, Michigan would pay him $16.5 million (including what he's been paid already this season), and if they fire him after this season, they would owe him $12.375 million for the final three years of his contract. Moore's contract also includes the obligation to seek alternative employment, where any amount earned there will offset Michigan's buyout payments. For Michigan, that is a relative drop in the bucket. With NCAA penalties having already been handed out for the sign-stealing scandal, if the Wolverines want to re-enter the coaching carousel, Moore's buyout is a minor impediment to doing so. The biggest possible concern with firing Moore wouldn't be money, but instead would be whether Underwood would explore options in the transfer portal due to a coaching change. The new reality of college football is that, like in the pros, you probably need to at least discuss a coaching change with your top stars to take their temperature on bringing in a new staff. \nIf Michigan is confident in their star quarterback sticking around, then Moore may need to finish with a flourish this season. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays lost Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday night to the Los Angeles Dodgers in heartbreaking fashion. The Blue Jays were two outs away from their first championship since 1993, but the Dodgers ended up winning in extra innings to become MLB's first repeat champ in 25 years.Fresh off securing the franchise's first AL East title since 2015 and first pennant since that aforementioned 1993 season, the Blue Jays will now head into the winter with plenty of questions to address if they want to repeat as division champions -- something Toronto hasn't done in more than three decades.Here are a few particular matters the Blue Jays will weigh this winter.1. What will happen with Bichette?Bo Bichette, the Blue Jays' starting shortstop since 2019, wasn't on the roster for most of their playoff run after spraining his knee late in the regular season. Bichette returned in the World Series and was impactful against the Dodgers, even though he was not 100%. Bichette hit a three-run home run off Shohei Ohtani in Game 7 that looked as if it might serve as the title-clinching blast. Alas, the Jays surrendered the lead, and it's possible that Bichette's absence earlier in October was a preview of life to come. He's now slated to hit the open market this winter as one of the most attractive free agents available. \nBichette, 27, is a career .294/.337/.469 hitter (121 OPS+) with 111 home runs and 60 stolen bases to show for his seven big-league seasons. His contributions have been worth an estimated 20.8 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference. Bichette isn't considered a strong defensive presence, but there's no denying his offensive aptitude -- that, plus his relative youth, will make him an appealing target for teams seeking an upgrade on the infield.\"I've said I want to be here from the beginning,\" Bichette told reporters after the Game 7 loss.The Blue Jays made a splash earlier this year when they locked up first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. on a $500 million extension, thereby preventing him from reaching free agency this offseason. Toronto general manager Ross Atkins confirmed he wanted to do the same with Bichette around that time, but nothing has materialized since.\n\"The interest is definitely there,\" Atkins said in April. \"…It's also our vision for [Guerrero and Bichette] to continue to play together. We will do everything in our power to see if we can line up.\"The Blue Jays will continue to have exclusive negotiating rights with Bichette for a few more days. After that, it's anyone's ballgame. If the two sides can't line up on a new agreement to keep Bichette in town, the Blue Jays could just slot in Andrés Giménez at the six, the way they have throughout this postseason. Alternatively, Toronto could look outside the organization. There aren't many compelling shortstop options available, however, suggesting that Giménez is not only the path of least resistance, but perhaps the best path period.2. What about the rotation?Bichette isn't the only notable Blue Jays veteran who could be on their way elsewhere. \nIndeed, most of Toronto's starting rotation is eligible for free agency, beginning with seasoned veterans Chris Bassitt and Max Scherzer. Deadline addition Shane Bieber could join them too, provided he does as expected and voids the $16 million player option he holds for the 2026 season. Those three combined to start 31 of Toronto's 66 second-half games.To provide further uncertainty, the Blue Jays also lost José Berríos to elbow inflammation in September and Bowden Francis to a shoulder impingement in June. The good news is that both resumed throwing throughout the month of October, though neither was deemed in position to help in a playoff round. Presumably Berríos and Francis will be good to go come this spring. If that is the case, the Blue Jays could -- without any re-signings or outside additions -- trot out a starting five consisting of Kevin Gausman, postseason breakout star Trey Yesavage, Berríos, Francis, and Eric Lauer. It stands to reason the Blue Jays will look to add at least one arm, if only for insurance purposes.\n3. Can key additions perform better in Year 2?For as well as the season played out for the Blue Jays, it's easy to forget that a few of their top additions from last winter did not live up to expectations.Outfielder Anthony Santander followed up the best full-season of his career by hitting just .175/.271/.294 (57 OPS+) with six home runs in 54 games. Closer Jeff Hoffman, meanwhile, posted a 4.37 ERA (98 ERA+) and issued more than 16 walks in his final 28 ⅔ innings -- those troubles didn't prevent him from saving 33 games and finishing 26 others, but they did stray from the marks he had compiled in the years prior. His home run issue (Hoffman allowed two homers per nine innings in the regular season) came back to bite him in Game 7 of the World Series as he allowed the game-tying blast to Miguel Rojas in the ninth inning.A return to form for either/both would go a long way in helping the Blue Jays position themselves to return to the World Series next fall.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Toronto Blue Jays lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday night. The nature of baseball is that the clock never stops ticking, and the Blue Jays will soon discover as much. In a matter of days, they'll lose exclusive negotiating rights with infielder Bo Bichette, one of the winter's top potential free agents.Bichette, 27, was recently ranked by CBS Sports as the third-best player in the class, behind Chicago Cubs outfielder Kyle Tucker and Boston Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman. Here's what we wrote:Bichette's optimal position is second base, but his bat may convince a team to tolerate his substandard play at short for a few more years yet. He rebounded from a down season by clearing a .290 average (for the fourth time in five tries) and 60 extra-base hits (for the third time). Bichette's flat swing allows him to wear out elevated pitches, with his .337 average on offerings located in the upper half ranking fifth among qualifiers. As an added bonus, he's on the younger side for a free agent (he'll turn 28 in March).While Bichette may still be processing the World Series loss, the Blue Jays front office and others around the league now have all the reason to dig in and figure out if and how he can fit into their plans. What's the book on him, good and bad? And just where might he land, and for how much? Below, CBS Sports has compiled a buyer's guide, of sorts, to one of the winter's most interesting free-agent cases.1. StrengthsThere's never a surefire way to predict how much a player is impacted by this or that injury. Still, it seems more safe than not to write off Bichette's 2024 as a result of the repeated calf issues and a fractured finger he suffered. That's because of his youth (he'll turn 28 in March) and his track record.To wit, Bichette has produced at a level 20% or better than the league-average hitter in four of his five full seasons. (He also cleared that mark in both of his partial seasons, 2019 and 2020.) Since becoming a full-time fixture in 2021, Bichette ranks eighth among active middle infielders (min. 2,000 plate appearances) in OPS+, behind names like Corey Seager, Mookie Betts, and Bobby Witt Jr.\nBichette is highly skilled at putting the barrel on the ball. He was one of four qualified batters in the 90-90 club -- that is, 90 mph average exit velocity and 90% in-zone contact rate. Bichette's swing features a flat attack angle, allowing him to get on top of pitches up in the zone. He's an all-fields hitter, too, spraying at least 25% of his batted balls to left, center, and right. Bichette's game isn't based on power. He doesn't prioritize pulling and lifting the ball or anything like that, but he has averaged 24 home runs and 41 doubles per 162 games. Those numbers may slip in a less-generous offensive environent. All the same, Bichette ought to remain a quality batter who can slot in as a prototypical No. 2 hitter if his new team so desires.  2. WeaknessesBichette's biggest flaw is his shortstop defense. He's always struggled on plays that require him to charge in, and this season those woes have extended to whenever he's asked to range in either lateral direction. He also has below-average arm strength; though that tends to be overvalued publicly, it may rule out a move to the hot corner. Bichette's exposure to second base in the postseason -- the first of his big-league career -- has been in response to his knee injury, but he's probably heading that way on a permanent basis sooner than later. Of course, the state of the shortstop position could persuade some teams to tolerate his substandard glove if it means adding his bat to the lineup.\nThe other notable flaw in Bichette's game is his approach. His 6.4% walk rate this season represented his highest since 2019, when he appeared in 49 games. Bichette has always offered at more than 53% of the pitches he's seen in a season, and he's not inherently picky about whether or not they're within the zone. Indeed, this season he ranked in the 12th percentile in chase rate. He must maintain a high rate of contact, ideally quality contact, in order to remain productive with such swing-happy tendencies. It's fair to point out too that Bichette hasn't appeared in 150 or more games in a season since 2022. He's required time on the shelf for soft-tissue injuries involving both knees, a calf, and a quad. Generally, teams have more concern about that subset of injuries than if a player misses time because of a broken bone, with the latter often being easier to regard as a fluke incident. \n3. Contract predictionWhile contractual terms may feel channeled from another dimension, you can make some good guesses by taking precedent and adjusting for inflation and other factors.\nIn Bichette's case, there are no shortage of recent contracts inked by shortstops in their late 20s. Two in particular feel relevant here: the seven-year, $177 million pact Dansby Swanson signed with the Chicago Cubs in December 2022, and the seven-year, $182 million agreement Willy Adames reached last winter with the San Francisco Giants. In both cases, you're talking about a lengthy agreement that paid between $25 million and $26 million annually. Bichette's defense may cause some teams to take pause, but it's probably fair to assume that he'll find a suitor willing to fork over something like seven years, $189 million.4. Potential suitorsThe Blue Jays are the most obvious landing spot for Bichette. They're the only team he's ever suited up for and they expressed interest in signing him to an extension back in the spring. Perhaps being fresh off a World Series appearance -- and the windfall that comes with it -- will help the two sides find enough common ground to reach a new, long-term arrangement.\nShould Bichette reach free agency, it's worth wondering if old Blue Jays boss Alex Anthopoulos, now at the helm with the Braves, would be willing to overlook his defensive limitations and install him at short. Atlanta's plausible interest could hinge on if Ha-Seong Kim opts out of his contract, however. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles Angels are also managed generally by Perry Minasian, a scout with the Blue Jays when they drafted Bichette. That doesn't guarantee interest, but the Angels could use the help if they want to return to the postseason. Pairing Bichette with Zach Neto would make for a strong double-play combination. Beyond those clubs, the teams who received the least production from shortstop this season either have a strong internal candidate (Detroit Tigers), probably won't spend the money (Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers), or may have hang-ups about the defense (New York Yankees). \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Deion Sanders made plenty of outlandish claims when he took the head coaching job at Colorado. Nearly three years later, most of them came to fruition. Sanders produced a once-in-a-generation Heisman winner (Travis Hunter) and helped his son (Shedeur Sanders) become an NFL Draft pick. He recorded the most wins in a season at Colorado since 2016 and drew more eyeballs than almost any other program in the sport. On Saturday, Shedeur was back in town to see his father during the Cleveland Browns' bye week. Instead of a triumphant return, it only emphasized how much has changed in Boulder in only a year. One week after getting blasted by Utah, Colorado lost 52-17 against Arizona. The Buffaloes have been outscored 81-7 in the first half of games over the past two weeks, ending their chances before they started. Losing badly to Utah is one thing -- the Utes are one of the Big 12's premier programs. An Arizona squad that came into Week 10 1-3 in Big 12 play is a little tougher to swallow. \nAfter the loss to Utah, Sanders told his team that the book was out on how to beat them, especially by blitzing quarterback Kaidon Salter and an inconsistent offensive line. If there is a plan, Arizona followed it to perfection, with a fan exodus from Folsom Field before the second half even started. The Wildcats forced a punt and a fumble as the Buffs ended the first quarter with minus-12 yards. They scored five touchdowns in seven drives with only one punt. They took a 38-7 lead into halftime with a pair of forced turnovers and 212 yards passing from quarterback Noah Fifita alone. Highly-rated freshman Julian Lewis came off the bench and threw a fun touchdown, but that was about it for positive moments. And ultimately, that's the greatest tragedy of the 2025 season for Colorado. They're no longer even entertaining. \nHeading into the weekend, Colorado ranks No. 15 in the Big 12 in both total offense and defense. They're 13th in scoring defense and 14th in scoring offense. They only have one total player that ranks top 100 nationally in passing, rushing or receiving. They're just not very good at anything. And because of the sheer number of transfers, Colorado isn't especially young. Especially in the trenches, the vast majority of top trench contributors are gone after this season. This was supposed to be a year to keep the train rolling, but instead it's flown off the tracks. Why should Lewis or highly-touted tackle Jordan Seaton even return to the program next year? Many have pointed out that Sanders took over a 1-11 team, which is true. That said, the season is a little misleading for its unique depths. Previously, Colorado reached at least four wins in every season since 2014. With West Virginia suddenly streaking, the Buffaloes have a battle just to reach 4-8 again. The performances the Buffs put together over the last two weeks have compared with the lowest moments of the 21st Century. \nColorado has only lost by at least five touchdowns in consecutive weeks once in the past decade. It was during the 1-11 season. After another crushing loss, add 2025 to the list. So now what? According to BuffStampede publisher Adam Munsterteiger, staff changes are on the way. New portal adds too. \"There has been a lack of leadership in the locker room this season, and that showed itself in Salt Lake City,\" Munsterteiger told CBS Sports' Brad Crawford. \"Sanders has shown a willingness to make tough decisions and changes with his coaching staff previously. I would expect there to be adjustments to his staff in the near future, whether that comes in the next month or after the season.\"\nBut how attractive is the situation for people coming in? Sanders' first offensive coordinator, Sean Lewis, was pushed out midseason. His first defensive coordinator, Charles Kelly, left after a year. Now, offensive coordinator Pat Shumur and defensive coordinator Robert Livingstone are both on the hot seat. And when a new coach comes in, there's no telling who's even on the roster. Colorado brought in 104 new players in the last two classes alone. Thirty-eight players on the roster are listed as seniors or graduates, not counting a potential exodus. There's no guarantee that better players are on the way, especially without the allure of either a nine-win season -- or the chance to play with future NFL stars. So most likely, Sanders will be back in 2026 with a new collection of potential coaches and players. And for the fourth year in a row, Colorado will ride the roulette and hope that this roll is the one that lands on black. \nGranted, Sanders could make the choice to step away for health reasons. Sanders battled through bladder cancer over the offseason and has dealt with serious blood clots across his coaching career. No one would fault him for prioritizing his family and health, if he decided to make that choice. At the same time, Sanders signed a five-year, $54 million contract before the season. The number is more than he made across his entire NFL career. Colorado couldn't realistically fire Sanders regardless because of the fan backlash, but a $33 million buyout also makes it cost-prohibitive. Let's be clear, regardless of what happens from here. \"Coach Prime\" won. I was at the press conference after his shocking win over TCU in 2023, when he confronted several reporters and asked if they believed. He accomplished things in 2024 that few thought were possible. \nSanders went from assisting at a local private school in DFW to winning big at Jackson State and Colorado. Hunter's exploits will go down in college football history. When you tell the story of \"Deion,\" his crazy decision to jump into coaching and doing things no one has ever seen. Maybe the legend will get even bigger when it's told in a few decades. The best ones do. But now, the Colorado fairytale is over. Reality is coming. And unless Sanders has another superstar family member waiting in the wings, it's hard to see a way out. \n            ",

On Nov. 8, headlining the Week 11 action, Coach Dan Lanning and his Oregon Ducks will go on the road for a Big Ten showdown with the legendary Kirk Ferentz and Iowa. In addition to the Big Ten games on the docket, CBS Sports will also feature three legs in the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy rivalry between Army, Navy and Air Force. Army-Navy, of course, will be in its historic spot on the calendar, this year taking place on Dec. 13 in Baltimore. Check out the full schedule below, and then below the table a closer look at the matchups that will be featured as part of the early Big Ten on CBS schedule.      \n   Fall 2025 CBS college football schedule   DateTime (ET)GameSat., Aug. 23  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t7:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tStanford at Hawaii  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Aug. 30  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tNevada at Penn State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 6  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOklahoma State at Oregon  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 13  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tUSC at Purdue  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 20  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.         7:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMichigan at Nebraska         Washington at Washington State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Sept. 27  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOhio State at WashingtonSat., Oct. 4  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t12 p.m.         3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tAir Force at NavyPenn State at UCLASat., Oct. 11  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tIndiana at OregonSat., Oct. 18  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOhio State at WisconsinSat., Oct. 25  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tMinnesota at IowaSat., Nov. 1  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t12 p.m.         3:30 p.m.       7:30 p.m.    \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tArmy at Air ForceIndiana at Maryland        Washington State at Oregon State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Nov. 8  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tOregon at IowaSat., Nov. 15  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.    \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBig Ten on CBS Game  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tFri., Nov. 22  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBig Ten on CBS Game  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tFri., Nov. 28  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t12 p.m.      4 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tIowa at Nebraska      Boise State at Utah State  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Nov. 29  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3:30 p.m.   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tBig Ten on CBS Game  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tSat., Dec. 13  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t3 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tArmy-Navy Game  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tWed., Dec. 31  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t2 p.m.  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\tTony The Tiger Sun Bowl \t\t\t\tNow let's highlight the announced games for Big Ten on CBS in 2025.

The Hawkeyes are in the College Football Playoff conversation despite two close losses, while Oregon is looking to continue its bounce back from its lone setback against Indiana.This marks the first meeting between the two programs since 1994 and Oregon's first trip to Iowa City since 1989. Iowa has been strong at home in recent seasons, winning 16 of its last 19 games in Kinnick Stadium since the start of 2023.Oregon quarterback Dante Moore showed he can handle a raucous environment already this season when he helped lead the Ducks to an overtime win at Penn State.Iowa at Nebraska (11/27)Expect a close one on Black FridayIowa and Nebraska have delivered thrills nearly every Thanksgiving weekend for the last decade, and the small margins between the two programs has always packed intensity into their respective regular season finales. The interesting twist here is that while nine of the last 11 games in the rivalry have been decided by seven points or less, nine of the last 11 games have also been won by Iowa. If Matt Rhule and the Cornhuskers are going to have a true breakthrough season in 2025 it doesn't need to include a win over the Hawkeyes necessarily, but it would definitely help the vibes to finish the regular season by snapping this recent run of struggles.CBS Sports will announce additional details on its 2025 roster of game and studio announcers at a later date\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Hawks were among the teams expected to take a step forward this season in the Eastern Conference, but a 3-3 start and injury concerns for star point guard Trae Young have stripped away some of the excitement early in Atlanta. After Young injured his knee on Wednesday night against the Brooklyn Nets when a teammate fell into him, there was some initial good news in it not being a torn ACL. However, the team announced an MRI on Saturday revealed a sprained MCL that will keep him out for at least four weeks before they re-evaluate him -- which means the absence could extend beyond that initial timetable. For a Hawks team that has been largely built around Young's abilities on the offensive end for years, they'll face a serious challenge navigating the next month without him. That said, the reason for optimism entering this season was the Hawks were the deepest, most talented group of teammates Young has had in Atlanta on paper, and that means they should be better equipped for his absence. How the Hawks can succeed without YoungFriday's 128-108 win over the Pacers in their NBA Cup opener provided a glimpse at the ideal scenario for how the Hawks can play without Young in the lineup. \nDyson Daniels had one of his best offensive games of the season stepping into the point guard role with Nickeil Alexander-Walker taking over at the two guard spot. Those two combined for 39 points and Daniels had six assists and nine rebounds to do a bit of everything for Atlanta from the point guard spot. Their ability as a duo to wreak havoc on defense can lead to easy offense, and the Hawks will have to lean on their defensive upside in Young's absence. Daniels living up to the $100 million contract the Hawks just gave him prior to the season will be critical to whether they can stay afloat in November. This is also an opportunity for Jalen Johnson to prove himself as a leading man, as many in Atlanta hoped to see him take a leap as an All-Star this season. On Saturday, his full skillset was on display when he led the team in all three major categories with 22 points, 13 rebounds and eight assists in the win in Indiana. Johnson was having a breakout 2024-25 campaign before an injury shut him down, and without Young they'll need him to not just show flashes of brilliance but be a consistent star-level player for the Hawks to reach their goals. While it'll take a group effort to cover for what Young brings as a scorer and facilitator, Daniels and Johnson are the two most important players in terms of taking on the playmaking role for Atlanta over the next month. \nThe schedule will get more difficult than the Pacers and Nets, and their next five games against the Cavs, Magic, Raptors, Lakers and Clippers will offer a more true assessment of what this group is capable of without Young. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 1998-2000 New York Yankees are no longer baseball's last repeat champions. The Los Angeles Dodgers, thanks to a historic Game 7 comeback, beat the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 to win this year's World Series despite looking shockingly feeble for much of the series. The on-paper rotation advantage didn't materialize, the offense vanished for games at a time, and the bullpen and defense were too often unreliable. The Dodgers won despite looking like the inferior team for most of the seven games.You needn't try hard to see the Dodgers winning the NL West again next year, and finishing with one of the best records in baseball (if not the best) and making another run to the World Series. It's a talented roster with a deep farm system, a smart front office, and an ownership group that is willing to go above and beyond financially. The Dodgers are as all-in as a team can get. Here's what the Dodgers need to do this offseason to get stay on the top of the sport. \n        \n            \n                Dodgers end MLB's World Series repeat drought, join exclusive club of back-to-back winners\n                \n                    Dayn Perry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n 1. It's time to start turning over the roster Truth be told, the Dodgers started this process months ago. Longtime backup catcher Austin Barnes, the club's longest-tenured position player, was released in May. Not even a week later, the Dodgers released super utility man Chris Taylor, a staple since 2016. Despite being popular teammates and important players in the franchise's recent history, neither Barnes nor Taylor were productive players anymore, so the Dodgers moved on. They did what they felt was best for the team, feelings be damned. The Dodgers must continue that process this offseason and some of it will happen organically with future Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw having already announced his retirement. The Enrique Hernández era has run its course, especially since Postseason Kiké is no longer guaranteed to show up (he was largely quiet after the Wild Card Series). Now 35, Max Muncy remains a quality platoon bat, though he's a liability at third base, and is at the age when offensive decline can come quick. The front office may have to take Blake Treinen away from manager Dave Roberts to get him to stop using him. \nLos Angeles had the oldest group of position players in baseball this season and some of those guys (Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Teoscar Hernández, Shohei Ohtani, Will Smith) are locked in long-term. They aren't locked into everyone, though, and there's an obvious need to infuse some youth into the roster (Alex Freeland, Dalton Rushing, soon enough Josue De Paula, etc.). The Dodgers need to get more athletic and better defensively, and also incorporate into the lineup more players who are on the upswing and entering their prime rather than trying to stave off age-related decline. Turning the page on a group of players who were important figures in a prosperous era of your team's history is a difficult step, but it is a necessary one and it is an unavoidable one. Several of those players for the Dodgers have already aged out as regulars or are in the process of aging out as regulars. Saying goodbye to them is tough, especially for fans, but it is the front office's job to put emotion aside and put the team in the best position moving forward. The Dodgers did that in May with Barnes and Taylor. That work must continue this winter.  2. They need another high-end bat The Dodgers sputtering offensively throughout the World Series may have surprised many given the names in the lineup, but anyone who watched them regularly this season knew it didn't come out of nowhere. The Dodgers had a knack for hard-to-believe ice cold streaks at the plate throughout the summer, and the fact of the matter is they had a mediocre offense over the final three months of the regular season. Here are their numbers from July 1 through the end of the regular season: \n DodgersMLB rankBatting average \t\t\t\t.241 \t\t\t\t20th \t\t\t\tOn-base percentage \t\t\t\t.315 \t\t\t\t14th \t\t\t\tSlugging percentage \t\t\t\t.419 \t\t\t\t11th \t\t\t\tRuns per game \t\t\t\t4.53 \t\t\t\t16th \t\t\t\tThat is a long stretch -- 77 team games, to be precise -- of being a middle of the pack offense, and there were times they were downright putrid. What happened in the World Series wasn't anything that hadn't happened for a week at a time in July, August, or September. The Dodgers have to add youth into the roster. They also just need more bats. This is not a juggernaut (or even comfortably above average) offense right now despite its star power. It is no surprise then that it has already been reported the Dodgers are expected to pursue Kyle Tucker, the offseason's best free agent and one of the top hitters and all-around players in the sport. He would fit wonderfully in right field (with Teoscar sliding over to left) and in the middle of the lineup. The Dodgers were connected to Cleveland Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan at the trade deadline and could circle back. Tampa Bay Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe is surely a trade candidate as a Rays player with an eight-figure salary. He would be a one-year rental and lengthen the lineup nicely. The offense was top heavy during the regular season and even moreso in October. The bottom four or five spots in the lineup were too often a black hole. There is room to add a bat in the outfield -- Michael Conforto was one of the worst-hitting regulars in baseball this year, so much so that he was left off the postseason roster all four rounds the Dodgers played -- and Tommy Edman's versatility allows the Dodgers to seek an infielder too. The offense is not really as bad as it looked at times during the World Series, though there is clearly room for improvement here.  3. The bullpen needs to be reworked The Dodgers won the World Series despite a really bad trade deadline. Conforto's poor season was not a secret and yet the only outfielder they acquired was righty platoon guy Alex Call. The bullpen was a problem all season, and their only addition was righty Brock Stewart, who made four appearances before going down with a shoulder injury (not a shock given his injury history). The Dodgers bet on their improvement coming from within (Conforto, Treinen, Tanner Scott, Kirby Yates, et al being better) and they were losing that bet up until the final innings of Game 7. The bullpen ranked 21st in ERA and 25th in win probability during the regular season, including 22nd in ERA and 30th in win probability after the trade deadline, which better reflects the players who were available to them in the postseason. There was much consternation about payroll when the Dodgers signed Scott and Yates, but both pitched poorly and never got their seasons on track. Yates was left off the postseason roster. Scott had to be removed from the postseason roster during the NLDS because of an infection, though he did not appear in a game before that. He was deemed untrustworthy and was pushed far down the depth chart. Bullpens are tricky. Scott and Yates (and Treinen for that matter) were among the best relievers in the sport in 2024, then they were borderline unusable in 2025. Relievers can be like that. The Dodgers could run it back with largely the same relievers next season and get significantly better results, and not be the first team to do it. Some shuffling is required though. Scott will be back and it's likely hard-throwing Edgardo Henriquez will get more responsibility. Maybe Game 3 hero Will Klein too. Righty Paul Gervase, who was part of the Ben Rortvedt/Hunter Feduccia trade with the Rays, has a chance to be an impact bullpen arm soon. I don't think reworking the bullpen is as important and turning over part of the aging position player core and adding a difference-making bat, but it is something that has to happen. The bullpen the Dodgers ran out there all season and into the postseason was too much of a liability. Their rotation was as healthy as it's ever going to get, really, and we saw how quickly that can be undermined by a shaky relief crew. Bullpen improvement can come internally, at least to some extent, but it's safe to assume the Dodgers will make outside additions as well. (I can't say I expect them to give out another Scott-sized contract though.) We collectively make too much of the postseason and I'm including myself in that \"we.\" I certainly do it. They are the most important games of the season, but, ultimately, they are just a handful of games. The playoffs are good team vs. good team and a good team has to lose. As difficult as it can be, you have to be careful to not read too much into what happens in October. This is why general managers get the big bucks: to see through the noise and remain grounded. In the case of the 2025 Dodgers, they won the World Series despite an offense prone to going silent and a shaky bullpen, so the postseason really just reinforced what we already knew. The Dodgers need an impact bat (maybe two) and to rework their relief crew. Continuing to move on from their aging stalwarts like they did with Barnes and Taylor is a must as well. That era of Dodgers baseball is ending and they have to move forward and begin assembling a new core around Betts, Freeman, Ohtani, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto. This group has more championships in it, though that doesn't mean standing pat is the right move.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As you pick through the remnants of your leftover Halloween candy, the NFL is jam-packed with a loaded Week 9 slate. Of course, the most notable of the bunch is the latest chapter in the rivalry between Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes as Buffalo hosts the Chiefs at Highmark Stadium. While that matchup will dominate the late window, the early collection of games packs a punch as well, with the Vikings and Lions squaring off from Detroit, the red-hot Patriots hosting the Falcons, and two of the top defenses in the league clashing between the Broncos and Texans. But before you kick back, relax and unwrap your latest Reece's peanut butter cup, you need to get your bets in order. In case you were too busy with the holiday to zero in on best bets for the weekend, we're here to help. Below, you can find our best bets for Week 9 and picks for every game on the slate. Teams with bye weeks in Week 9: Cleveland, New York (Jets), Philadelphia, and Tampa Bay.NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook. Bet NFL at FanDuel and get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager.\nArizona Cardinals at Dallas CowboysMonday, 8:15 p.m. (ESPN/ABC | Fubo, try for free)\nEven with Kyler Murray still dealing with injury, Jacoby Brissett is good enough to exploit this poor Dallas defense. The Cowboys are allowing opposing quarterbacks to post a 112.0 passer rating this season -- worst in the league. With Marvin Harrison Jr. and Trey McBride in the fold, Brissett has plenty of weapons to do damage and have Dallas on upset alert. On the flip side, Arizona's defense is solid. The Cardinals rank top 10 in opponent passer rating, and if they can dilute Dak Prescott and Co. even a touch, it could tip the scales in their favor. While Arizona has dropped five-straight, they've been kind to bettors over that stretch, owning a 3-2 ATS record. Projected score: Cardinals 30, Cowboys 27The pick: Cardinals +3Minnesota Vikings at Detroit LionsSunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nI'll believe it when I see it with J.J. McCarthy, who is slated to make his return this week for Minnesota. This only comes after Carson Wentz was placed on injured reserve, and I'm not totally convinced Kevin O'Connell is thrilled about putting his young quarterback out there, but he's been painted into a corner. Outside of a fourth-quarter run against the Bears in Week 1, McCarthy has seven quarters of bad football on his short résumé. That includes a Week 2 performance where he couldn't lead the Vikings to double-digit points as he tossed two interceptions and fumbled three times (one lost).\nAnd he's supposed to now come back aboard and go toe-to-toe with a Lions team entering Week 9 on a four-game home winning streak -- each by at least 15 points? Detroit is also averaging 36.7 points per game at Ford Field in 2025. On top of that, the Lions are 4-0 ATS as a favorite this season, and I expect that streak to continue here.Projected score: Lions 33, Vikings 21The pick: Lions -8.5\n        \n            \n                Agent's Take: Did the Vikings miscalculate their quarterback decisions by going all in on J.J. McCarthy?\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJacksonville Jaguars at Las Vegas RaidersSunday, 4:05 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nThere's something I don't quite trust about the Jaguars, despite coming out of the bye with a 4-3 record and in the hunt in the AFC playoff picture. A chunk of that skepticism centers around Trevor Lawrence, who has yet to impress me as a passer in 2025. Currently, Lawrence has an 80.6 passer rating, which would be the lowest since his rookie season. The offensive line also hasn't done him many favors, contributing to his 20 sacks on the season. With Maxx Crosby ready to wreak havoc off the edge, the Raiders have a path to pulling off the home upset. Geno Smith hasn't been good in 2025, but he's also been playing somewhat with one hand tied behind his back with tight end Brock Bowers limited since Week 1 with a knee injury. Bowers, along with wideout Jakobi Meyers, are expected to be back this week, which should give the Raiders' passing attack some juice, particularly against a Jags defense that is surrendering 245.7 passing yards per game (27th in the NFL).   \nProjected score: Raiders 23, Jaguars 20The pick: Raiders +2.5Seattle Seahawks at Washington CommandersSunday, 8:20 p.m. (NBC | Fubo, try for free)\nJayden Daniels is another star in line to return this week, which should boost the spirits of a Commanders team that is 3-5 on the year. Is it enough to boost them to victory? I have my doubts, especially against an underrated Seahawks club. Seattle is top 10 in the NFL in points scored (27.6) and points allowed (19.4) per game this season, and also ranks third in yards per play (6.0) and yards per play allowed (4.7). This could be another game where Washington's defense is exposed. In the past three contests, the Commanders are giving up a league-high 32.3 points per game, and opposing quarterbacks are averaging a 111.2 passer rating over that stretch. The duo of Sam Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba could go off in prime time. While laying points on the road is already a risky endeavor, Seattle is 3-0 straight up and ATS on the road this year. Projected score: Seahawks 30, Commanders 24The pick: Seahawks -3Denver Broncos at Houston TexansSunday, 1 p.m. (Fox | Fubo, try for free)\nHow much of Houston's resurgence was the Texans finally flipping a switch, and how much was it injuries finally catching up to the San Francisco 49ers? I think we'll find out this weekend, and I expect it to be more of the latter. The notable nugget out of last week's dominating win by Houston was that C.J. Stroud went through the contest unscathed with zero sacks. It's hard to imagine that happening again; I assume the third-year quarterback will be back under siege, particularly against the Broncos. Denver leads the NFL with 36 sacks on the season, which is 10 more than any other team. \nOn top of getting after the quarterback, this defense should exploit a key weakness of the Texans' offense: red zone efficiency. Houston is scoring touchdowns on just 42.1% of its red zone trips, which is second-lowest in the league. Now, they face a Denver red zone defense allowing touchdowns on just 40% of opponents' trips, which is tied for the best in the NFL. This could be a little more lopsided than the minuscule spread suggests. Projected score: Broncos 24, Texans 20The pick: Broncos +1.5Rest of the bunchBears at BengalsProjected score: Bengals 27, Bears 24The pick: Bengals +2.5Panthers at PackersProjected score: Packers 33, Panthers 17The pick: Packers -13.5Chargers at TitansProjected score: Chargers 28, Titans 14The pick: Chargers -9.5Falcons at PatriotsProjected score: Patriots 27, Falcons 20The pick: Patriots -4.5\n49ers at GiantsProjected score: 49ers 24, Giants 17The pick: 49ers -2.5Colts at SteelersProjected score: Colts 30, Steelers 21The pick: Colts -3.5Saints at RamsProjected score: Rams 27, Saints 17The pick: Saints +14.5 Chiefs at BillsProjected score: Bills 28, Chiefs 24The pick: Bills +1.5\n            ",

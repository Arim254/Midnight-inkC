    "body": "\n        Clemson coach Dabo Swinney held it in for as long as he could before his internal thermometer finally exploded on the sideline during Saturday's 46-45 loss to Duke. Swinney's sideline tirade in the faces of his starting secondary was a microcosm of another team-wide failure during a lackluster season -- one that could be the Tigers' worst in more than two decades.Duke's climactic first win at Clemson in 45 years featured four touchdown passes and 361 yards passing from Darian Mensah, who gave the Blue Devils the lead with a successful 2-point conversion with 40 seconds to play on a bootleg toss to Sahmir Hagans. Duke got in position to punch it in after Clemson's Aveion Terrell was called for defensive pass interference near the goal line on 4th-and-10 inside the final minute of play.Nate Sheppard capped an 11-play, 94-yard drive -- Duke's longest of the season -- with a 3-yard touchdown run prior to Manny Diaz rolling the dice and going for the 2-point try.Clemson (3-5) has never missed bowl season under Swinney, but that changes if Tigers fail to three of their last four games against Florida State, Louisville, Furman and South Carolina.\nClemson went 6-5 under Tommy Bowden in 2004 but declined a bowl invitation following a brawl involving multiple players at the end of a 29-7 victory over South Carolina during rivalry weekend. Bowden stuck around 3.5 more years until Swinney took over during the second half of the 2008 campaign prior to the interim tag being removed after beating the Gamecocks.Clemson has finished with a losing record only six times in the last 50 years, only once coming under Swinney.Clemson's losing seasons since 1975 YearRecord19752–919763–6–219925–619945–619983–820106–7Clemson hasn't beaten a Power Four opponent at home since Virginia on Oct. 19, 2024, a span of six losses. This is coming from a program that saw its school record 40-game home winning streak snapped only three seasons ago by South Carolina, two years after the Tigers had accomplished six straight playoff appearances with two national titles under Swinney.\nDuke's explosive performanceComing out of an open week after a home loss to SMU last month, Clemson fell behind early after Duke managed 199 yards of offense and 21 points in the opening quarter. After recovering a bit defensively to frustrate the Blue Devils on consecutive three-and-outs, the Tigers lost their 28-21 lead in the final minute of second quarter thanks to Duke's tempo.Mensah's 43-yard home-run ball to Que'Sean Brown over the top of Clemson's two-deep marked Duke's second explosive score of the afternoon and sent Swinney into his sideline tizzy.Duke converted a fourth-and-2 at its own 44-yard line with 31 seconds and converted on Mensah's strike after Clemson cornerback Avieon Terrell dropped what would've been an interception near midfield.\nDuke converted four times on fourth down in the first half, and by intermission, Mensah was 15-of-24 passing for 241 yards and four touchdowns.Swinney's tirade was captured by TV cameras with partial audio as he scolded veterans Khalil Barnes, Ronan Hanafin and others.Another pivotal chunk play for Duke came on its final possession, a career-best 56-yard reception from tight end Jeremy Hasley on third-and-7. He later converted a fourth-and-1 on the first play following the 2-minute warning inside the 20 before the Blue Devils took the lead.\nAfter last month's home loss to SMU that pushed the Tigers to 3-4 on the season after being ranked inside the top five in August, Swinney pounded the table for \"credibility\" and what he's done in the past -- two national championships and nine ACC titles with the Tigers -- after watching his team stumble.\"I take the good with the bad,\" Swinney said. \"I don't like it, but that's just my perspective. And I know something good will come from it. I promise you, though, I've never worked harder. And I'm going to continue to do everything I can, and we'll be back.\"We'll win more championships. We'll win more championships. All right? I promise you that. May not happen this year, but we're going to win more championships. That's all I can say. And I think we have a track record that demonstrates that.\"\nWhat's the message now after yet another flat performance for one of college football's most-talented rosters?Clemson's ACC victories have come up against North Carolina and Boston College, teams who are a combined 1-8 in league play. And the Tigers needed 27 unanswered points to take out Troy in September, a week after losing to and LSU team that has since fired coach Brian Kelly.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin is not just a passenger on his team's ride to a possible Big Ten championship and another College Football Playoff berth. He's a wheelman.For much of the season, Sayin was looked at as another cog in the machine at Ohio State -- a young QB taking advantage of playing on an offense that surrounded him with elite talent, particularly at the wide receiver position. That was certainly true to start the year. Ohio State opened its season with what looked to be its most difficult game on the schedule against Texas. It was in that game that Ryan Day and the Buckeyes staff took an approach of not putting too much on Sayin's plate.They've loaded more onto it as the season has progressed, however, and Sayin continues to answer every challenge and excel.Sayin completed 20 of his 23 pass attempts for 316 yards and four touchdowns in Ohio State's 38-14 win over Penn State on Saturday. It's the seventh straight game he's completed at least 70% of his pass attempts, and the fourth time he's finished a game with a completion rate over 85%. It's the fifth time this season he's thrown for at least 300 yards and three touchdowns in a game, becoming the first Ohio State QB to do so since CJ Stroud in 2021. Stroud, like Sayin this year, was a redshirt freshman during that season. I'm sure Ohio State would love it if Sayin's career in Columbus follows the same path as Stroud's, though perhaps with a national title or two.\nAnd it's not like he's out there dinking and dunking.\nSayin's performance against Penn State launched him to the lead of the Heisman Trophy odds at multiple sportsbooks, but it's not a reactionary measure. Sayin has been slowly building toward this and has been playing at an elite level for a while now.His box score stats betray his play in wins over Washington and Illinois. In Seattle, it was clear early that the Huskies weren't going to put up many points, which led to the Buckeyes leaning more on their run game in a tough road environment. Sayin and the Buckeyes' passing attack were happy to make short throws and nick the Huskies' defense at will while it dropped guys deep looking to take away explosives.Against Illinois, Ohio State's offense was gifted with short fields by the Illini turnovers, so it was impossible to rack up big yardage numbers. He was still remarkably efficient in those games, which is the hallmark of who he is.\nIt's that efficiency that likely causes some people to look at Sayin as an exceptional game manager, but that viewpoint ignores what truly separates him from so many college quarterbacks. Ohio State's offense has always done a great job of making things \"easier\" on its quarterbacks, but Sayin shows a high IQ in the offense for somebody who remains relatively inexperienced. The ball is out on time and typically with impeccable placement. It's either going to be caught by his target and give him a chance to get yards after the catch, or it's going to fall incomplete.\nSayin also doesn't force things that aren't there, which is not typical of most freshmen, redshirt or otherwise. He has not thrown an interception since Ohio State's Week 3 win over Ohio. He hasn't even fumbled. In other words, he manages the game while making exceptional plays that few other quarterbacks in the country are capable of.The last thing other contenders wanted to see this year was an Ohio State team with an incredible defense and NFL talent on offense find itself with an elite QB to boot, but they've got one. \n            ",

Maye put his league-leading completion percentage (75.2%) to the test against a tough Browns defense and came away with 282 passing yards and three touchdowns. Third-year receiver Kayshon Boutte now has at least one touchdown catch in three straight games and Stefon Diggs tallied his first TD of the season against the Browns. The defense has been solid overall and is only allowing 18.3 points per game. Plus, the Patriots have cleaned up since a mistake-heavy loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 3 and now enter Week 9 with a plus-two turnover ratio.Click here to bet Falcons vs. Patriots at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of at least $5 wins:Model's Falcons vs. Patriots score prediction, picksNew England is 6-2-0 ATS and has covered in five straight while Atlanta is 3-4-0 ATS and has failed to cover the spread in two straight.

    "body": "\n        Sunday's NFL schedule features three games in the 4 p.m. ET window, including one of the matchups many NFL fans were most looking forward to when the 2025 NFL schedule was released, as the Buffalo Bills host the Kansas City Chiefs. It may come as a surprise since Josh Allen has never played in a Super Bowl and Patrick Mahomes has made five, but the Bills are 4-1 during the regular season in Allen vs. Mahomes contests. The SportsLine model expects that trend to continue, backing the Bills to beat the Chiefs despite being +110 underdogs in the latest Week 9 NFL odds. The Chiefs are favored by 2 points, while the over/under is set at 52.5 points.The model's two other best bets for the late-afternoon window for NFL betting feature the Saints being competitive enough with the Rams to cover the spread as 14-point underdogs, and Under 44.5 total points for Jaguars vs. Ravens. Before locking in your Week 9 NFL picks, be sure to check out the top NFL betting picks from SportsLine's advanced computer model. New users can target the latest bet365 promo code, which gives new users $200 in bonus bets whether their first bet wins or loses: The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 9 on a sizzling 45-28 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Week 9 NFL best bets for Sunday, Nov. 2 (odds subject to change): Jaguars vs. Raiders: Under 44.5 total pointsSaints (+14) vs. RamsBills (+110) to defeat the ChiefsCombining the model's three picks into a Week 9 NFL parlay would result in a payout of +649 (risk $100 to win $649). Bet it now at DraftKings Sportsbook:Jaguars vs. Raiders: Under 44.5 total pointsThe Jaguars and Raiders have two of the bottom eight scoring offenses in the NFL, including Las Vegas with the second-worst scoring offense at 14.7 points per game. Geno Smith hasn't performed at the same level in Las Vegas as he did during his resurgence in Seattle. He has seven touchdowns compared to 10 interceptions this season and threw for just 67 yards against the Chiefs in Week 7 before their bye. The Jaguars have also been one of the surprisingly better defensive units in the NFL, ranking 15th in scoring defense at 22.1 ppg, but they rank 25th in scoring at 20.9 ppg. The model projects the Under to hit in 58% of simulations. Saints (+14) vs. RamsQuarterback Tyler Shough, a second-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft out of Louisville, is set to make his first NFL start for New Orleans this week, and he draws a tough defense to make it against. Although he's a rookie, Shough has plenty of high-level football experience, playing in 42 games over seven years of college football. He entered in relief against Tampa Bay last week and completed 17 of 30 passes for 128 yards with no touchdowns and one interception, but with an entire week to prepare, he could have better results on Sunday. Despite a 1-7 record, New Orleans has only two losses by 14 points or fewer, and the model expects the Saints to stay within the margin on Sunday, projecting New Orleans to cover in 60% of simulations.Bills (+110) to defeat the ChiefsThe Bills host the Chiefs on Sunday, and Buffalo is 11-1 in Orchard Park since the start of last season. They've been a dominant home team, and the model expects them to continue with an upset victory on Sunday. Josh Allen is 4-1 over his regular-season career against Patrick Mahomes, including a 30-21 win last year in Buffalo. The Bills are coming off a dominant 40-9 win against the Panthers last week as they have the No. 4 scoring offense at 29.6 ppg this season. The model projects the Bills to win in 55% of simulations, despite being the underdogs.Want more Week 9 NFL picks?You've seen the model's Week 9 NFL best bets for Sunday.

The promotion brings its latest edition of Saturday Night's Main Event to Salt Lake City with an astounding four title matches on the bill. The biggest is set to see a new champion crowned when Jey Uso and CM Punk battle it out for the vacant world heavyweight championship that Seth Rollins was forced to relinquish.Rollins was forced to vacate the title after The Vision's Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed betrayed him on the episode of Raw immediately following Crown Jewel. Punk was granted a vacant title match, with his opponent determined in a battle royal. Jey Uso outlasted the field to set up Saturday's clash to crown a new king.Speaking of champions, Saturday Night's Main Event is loaded with title matches. Undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes and Drew McIntyre run it back. McIntyre was scheduled to face Jacob Fatu on the ensuing episode of SmackDown after Crown Jewel, but Fatu was found backstage laid out. With McIntyre in the ring ready to be declared No.1 contender again, Rhodes stormed in and took the fight to him. The pair have been at each other's throats since and look to settle the score on Saturday.Jade Cargill hopes her new mean streak is enough to dethrone Tiffany Stratton when the two battle for Stratton's WWE women's title.

Saturday will be the third time that they've met since Oct. 18 as Miami look to win three straight in the series. If Lionel Messi and the Herons can accomplish that, they'll spare us from seeing a fourth match between the two with this MLS Cup Playoffs tie seeing Inter Miami lead the best-of-three series 1-0.Messi is doing the best that he can to avoid that while putting last season's disappointment behind him. The Herons were knocked out of the MLS Cup Playoffs in the first round by Atlanta United, leading to change throughout the club. In these two games facing Nashville, Messi has scored five goals and assisted one more. He also now has at least a brace in three consecutive matches and goal contributions in four straight. How to watch Nashville SC vs. Inter Miami, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 1 | Time: 7:40 p.m. ETLocation: Geodis Park -- Nashville, TennesseeLive stream: MLS Season PassOdds: Nashville SC +150; Draw +270; Inter Miami +155Likely to win the league MVP award, Messi has consistently shown why he is indispensable to everything that Javier Mascherano and the Herons want to do. Even the defensive issues that the team had were improved upon in their second match against Nashville. Changes in marking kept Sam Surridge from seeing the ball, as Nashville's only goal came from a peach of a free kick by Hany Mukhtar. \nIt will be tougher to keep Nashville completely contained with the match taking place at Geodis Park, but with the run that Miami are on, there aren't many teams in the league who can actually stop them from imposing their will. Making sure that they get rest by winning this series in two matches would ensure that the Herons have the best possibility of continuing their playoff run where anything but an MLS Cup victory would be a disappointment. \n            \n    ",

Three points separate Toluca in first place from Monterrey in fifth as things have never been tighter this late in the season. With Liga MX sides being able to add global superstars to their ranks ahead of this season, it's turning into a title race for the ages, but so far, Toluca have been holding their own. Leading the league with 41 goals scored, no team is within 10 goals of them, and their plus-23 goal difference is also tops by a significant margin over Tigres in second. Despite how close things are, Toluca can clinch the top spot with a victory away to Atlas, a draw between Tigres and Monterrey, and some help, but with how this Liga MX season has gone, things could go to the final day before playoffs kick off. Much of the top of the table action can be found on the CBS Sports Golazo Network, where Sergio Ramos, German Berterame, and Monterrey will try to stop Toluca's closest competitor in Tigres.Since adding Angel Correa to their ranks alongside Andre-Pierre Gignac and Juan Brunetta, Tigres have been an absolute unit in Liga MX play. They've also played solid defense, so it's no surprise that they're making a comeback atop the table as teams look to break Club America's reign.Andre Jardine's men are well set up for the playoffs, but they will need help if they are to win the regular season title.

Murray injured his foot in the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans. He finished that game but has not played since. Murray was able to further rest his foot last week during the team's bye week, but he is not quite ready to return to the starting spot. \"He is getting better,\" Gannon said via ESPN. \"He's had some more work this last week, but like I said, he's just not ready to go yet. I know he wants to be out there and he is doing everything he can. It's just he's not quite there yet.\"\n        \n            \n                Biggest need for all 32 NFL teams ahead of the trade deadline: Packers, Cowboys may be looking for DB help\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBrissett has started in place of Murray for the last two games against the Indianapolis Colts and Green Bay Packers.

The Cardinals are averaging 118.2 rushing yards with Murray this season and just 91 yards per game without him. \nThe Cardinals have lost five straight following a 2-0 start and haven't seen a check in the win column since Week 2.

    "body": "\n        The two active members of the Pac-12 square off for the first of two regular-season matchups Saturday in Corvallis, Oregon. Familiar foes in Washington State and Oregon State will become even closer in the coming weeks as they conduct a home-and-home for conference supremacy, and the opening leg is set for 7:30 p.m. ET on CBS.The Cougars (4-4) hit the road for the fourth time in five games and seek to move closer to bowl eligibility in Year 1 under coach Jimmy Rogers. The Beavers (1-7), in contrast, are in the midst of a three-game home stand and seek to build momentum on the heels of their first win of the season. Interim coach Robb Akey, who took over after Oregon State fired Trent Bray, led them to a 45-13 win over FCS Lafayette prior to their bye week.Click here to bet Oregon State vs. Washington State at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:Returners from last year's Washington State squad will also likely have vengeance on their minds after the Pacific Northwest rivals delivered a classic in their 2024 matchup. The Cougars fell short in a 41-38 shootout last year as they watched the Beavers win the quasi-Pac-12 championship game in thrilling fashion. They are unquestionably the stronger team this time around, but that was also the case last November.\n   Washington State vs. Oregon State: Need to know   Let's play two: It's not unprecedented for two teams to face each other twice in a regular season, but it's far from common. New Mexico State was the last program to do so, playing Hawaii twice in 2021 to fill out an independent schedule. Washington State and Oregon State found themselves in similar situations after the mass exodus from the Pac-12 and the expiration of their 2024 scheduling agreement with the Mountain West, forcing them to piece together slates full of nontraditional matchups. The Cougars will host the Beavers on Nov. 29 to close out the regular season, marking their second meeting in a month for the longtime conference companions.Playing up: One hallmark of these teams' unconventional schedules is a string of road matchups against ranked Power Four opponents. Washington State handled those challenges better than Oregon State, nearly pulling off upsets of No. 7 Ole Miss and No. 15 Virginia. The Cougars lost those games on Oct. 11 and Oct. 18 by a combined five points, with their defense leading the way in limiting both opponents to 24 points or fewer.Johnson provides a spark: Oregon State remains a program in flux -- including at quarterback. Maalik Murphy started the first eight games before giving way to backup Gabarri Johnson midway through the most recent contest. A more mobile threat who had previously appeared in rushing packages, Johnson excelled in the 45-13 win over Lafayette in his biggest role of the season. He completed seven of nine passes, ran for 82 yards and totaled two touchdowns to jolt a struggling offense.\nDefense stiffens: Washington State's defense was gashed for 59 points by both North Texas on Sept. 13 and Washington the following week in the Apple Cup. Since then, the Cougars have looked like a far more disciplined unit. None of their four opponents since that stretch have scored more than three touchdowns. Linebacker Parker McKenna has been central to that turnaround as the team's leading tackler, while edge rusher Isaac Terrell -- who missed last week with an injury -- posted two sacks and four tackles for loss against Ole Miss.Hand it to Hankerson: Anthony Hankerson entered the season as one of college football's top running backs but struggled to replicate his 2024 success during Oregon State's 0-7 start. That changed dramatically last week. The second-year Beaver set career highs with 204 rushing yards and four touchdowns as Oregon State shredded Lafayette's defense, particularly in the second half.Where to watch Washington State vs. Oregon State liveDate: Saturday, November 1 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Reser Stadium -- Corvallis, OregonTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium\n   Washington State vs. Oregon State prediction, picks   \nOregon State played its best football of the season last time out, but don't be fooled by the 45-13 victory. Beating up on an FCS opponent is no sure sign of a turnaround, especially given that it took until the second half to pull away. Washington State is the better offensive team in this matchup, its defense seems to have turned a corner and it will have the special teams advantage against one of the worst teams in the country in that regard. The Cougars are better in all three phases than a team simply looking to get across the finish line with its interim staff.

    "body": "\n        The Los Angeles Dodgers and Toronto Blue Jays will play a winner-take-all Game 7 on Saturday night to determine this year's World Series champion. The Dodgers forced the decisive contest on Friday, defeating the Blue Jays in Game 6 to sustain their hopes of becoming MLB's first repeat champion since the New York Yankees from 1998-2000. The Blue Jays will retain home-field advantage in Game 7, however, as they try to secure their first title since winning both the 1992 and 1993 Fall Classics.\n        \n            \n                World Series Game 7 predictions: Blue Jays vs. Dodgers expert picks with MLB championship on the line\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPitching has been the story of the series. Whether it's Yoshinobu Yamamoto throwing a complete game, Trey Yesavage breaking a longstanding rookie record, or the two sides exhausting themselves in a marathon Game 3, the pitchers on both teams have been the engine making the series go. It would be only fitting, then, if the pitching staffs end up being the talk of Game 7, too.If you squint, you can already see that shape on the horizon. The Blue Jays are starting Max Scherzer, a veteran of eight prior winner-take-all games. All the signs pointed to Shohei Ohtani getting the Dodgers' nod, but Los Angeles only confirmed as much on Saturday six-plus hours before first pitch.Below CBS Sports has highlighted the state of each staff entering Game 7, all the while providing an \"ideal\" roadmap for each team on their pursuit of glory.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles DodgersPitcherG6 pitchesDays of restBlake Snell (Game 5 starter)02Yoshinobu Yamamoto (Game 6 starter)960Tyler Glasnow30Roki Sasaki330Blake Treinen02Anthony Banda02Emmet Sheehan04Jack Dreyer03Edgardo Henriquez\t02Justin Wrobleski\t160Will Klein04Clayton Kershaw04Using Ohtani as the starter is the logical call. MLB's rulebook allows for a starting pitcher to serve as DH, and to remain in the game as a hitter even after being removed as a pitcher. There are no carveouts for relievers, however, meaning the Dodgers would have to shed the DH and move Ohtani to a defensive position (likely left field) to keep him in the game if they used him as a reliever and later made a pitching change. That's without factoring in the logistical issue of having Ohtani, who is used to warming up before the game begins, tossing while his spot in the order looms.Dodgers manager Dave Roberts seemed to tip his hand about using Ohtani as a pitcher again in this series earlier in the week.\"I haven't talked to Shohei yet, but obviously he won't be available tonight,\" Roberts said prior to Game 5. \"We'll see where he comes in beyond that. But I haven't had that conversation. But certainly, when you're talking about Game 6, potentially Game 7 of the World Series, all hands on deck. So we'll see where that goes.\"If he can go, if it makes sense, certainly he would be an option.\"\n        \n            \n                Dodgers' World Series Game 7 pitching plans: Why Shohei Ohtani is starting vs. Blue Jays\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPresuming Ohtani gives the Dodgers two or three innings, the question becomes, where do they go from there? Glasnow was penciled in as the bulk pitcher for Game 7, but it's possible that his relief appearance in Game 6 causes the Dodgers to pull back on how far they let him work on Saturday. Roberts has said that everyone except Yamamoto, the Game 6 starter, is available for duty. (Yamamoto, the mad hatter he appears to be, suggested he would be willing to pitch if needed.)In an ideal world, the Dodgers would lock most of their bullpen in the clubhouse. Rather than tempt fate by drawing from a unit that tied for the second most meltdowns during the regular season, Roberts would tease nine innings from a combination of Ohtani, Glasnow, and Snell. If Roberts does have to slot in a reliever, you have to assume he'll want to do it on a situational basis. Maybe Anthony Banda versus a left-handed batter here, or Emmet Sheehan against the bottom of the order there.Ideal gameplan: Ohtani, Glasnow, and Snell each turn over the Blue Jays lineup once apiece, with Roberts interjecting a reliever or two only if absolutely necessary. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Toronto Blue JaysPitcherG6 pitchesDays of restTrey Yesavage (Game 5 starter)02Kevin Gausman (Game 6 starter)930Shane Bieber03Jeff Hoffman02Seranthony Domínguez\t100Louis Varland\t170Brendon Little\t04Chris Bassitt\t130Mason Fluharty\t80Braydon Fisher\t04Eric Lauer\t04On Toronto's side of the ledger, the key will be not allowing Scherzer to overstay his welcome. Yes, he's enjoyed a storied career, and yes, he's as intimidating as they come nowadays. But those are no reasons to entrust him with facing this Dodgers order more than once unless the score dictates otherwise.Manager John Schneider seems less likely to try to patch together this game with starters. The Blue Jays clearly like deploying Fluharty against Ohtani and Seranthony Domínguez versus Teoscar Hernández. You can probably pencil those matchups in one last time. The Blue Jays, unlike the Dodgers, have a fresh closer. Jeff Hoffman probably gets an inning of work in Game 7, and it shouldn't surprise anyone if he ends up working across multiple frames, the way he has three other times this postseason. The x-factor here is Yesavage. He struck out 12 Dodgers as part of his Game 5 start, suggesting he may have figured out a lineup that chased him after four innings in Game 1. The Blue Jays will almost certainly use him in Game 7, though it's fair to wonder if it'll just be for an inning or two as Toronto balances the risk-reward dynamic with their budding young star right-hander.\"Yup, everyone that is active on the roster will be available to pitch,\" Schneider said following Game 6. \"Maybe even [Gausman]. So it will be all hands on deck.\" The Blue Jays shouldn't need length. Not only can they likely pencil in multiple innings from Scherzer, Hoffman, and Yesavage, but they have Bieber and Bassitt (albeit on one day's rest) available to them as well. There's simply no excuse for overexposing anyone.Ideal gameplan: Scherzer turns the lineup over once before giving way to matchup-based relievers like Fluharty and Domínguez.

    "description": "\n        This has not been the rookie season many expected from Ashton Jeanty after he was the No. 6 overall pick by the Las Vegas Raiders in the 2025",
    "body": "\n        This has not been the rookie season many expected from Ashton Jeanty after he was the No. 6 overall pick by the Las Vegas Raiders in the 2025 NFL Draft. However, there is plenty of blame to go around the Las Vegas offense, which ranks 31st in the NFL at 14.7 points per game this season. The Raiders are coming off their bye, though, after being shut out by the Chiefs, and that additional time to prepare for a matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars could lead to better offensive success. The rookie has five of the Raiders' 10 touchdowns this season, and the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has Jeanty among its top picks for Week 9 anytime TD scorer bets at +105 odds at online sports betting sites. The model also has a few other top picks for Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer bets, including Josh Jacobs to remain on a roll for the Green Bay Packers, and Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze to cash for Week 9 anytime TD scorer bets. Targeting anytime touchdown bets is one way to approach Week 9 NFL betting at online sports betting sites. With NFL props available for almost every player in every game at sportsbooks, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model can help you find value to add to your Week 9 NFL picks. It can also help new users take advantage of sportsbook promos like the latest bet365 bonus code, where new users receive $200 in bonus bets with a $5 wager, whether it wins or loses.Best Week 9 NFL anytime touchdown picks:Josh Jacobs, Packers (-145)Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+105)Rome Odunze, Bears (+125)Parlay these picks for +625 odds with a DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if your first bet of $5 or more wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free: (odds subject to change)Josh Jacobs, Packers (-145) Jacobs has scored a touchdown in six of seven games this season, including in each of the last four contests. The Packers RB1 has seven touchdowns over his last four games, with three different two-touchdown performances. He's second in the NFL with nine rushing touchdowns entering a contest against the Panthers, who allowed 216 yards and two touchdowns to Buffalo running back James Cook last week. The Panthers are allowing 4.6 yards per rush, which ranks 24th in the NFL, and even at -145 odds, the model sees strong value in Jacobs scoring a touchdown, which he does in 80% of simulations.Click here to bet on Jacobs as a Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer at DraftKings, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins, plus three months of NBA League Pass free:Ashton Jeanty, Raiders (+105)The Raiders' rookie has scored half of Las Vegas' touchdowns this season (five), with three rushing and two receiving scores. Las Vegas was shut out by the Chiefs in its last game, but the Raiders are coming off a bye, and that additional time between games could lead to a more successful game plan. Jeanty has four touchdowns over his last four games, and he's played more than 60% of snaps in four of his last fives games as he grasps a better concept of being an NFL running back and the Raiders' offense. The Raiders play the Jaguars, who are coming off a 35-7 loss to the Rams in Week 7, and the model projects Jeanty to score in 70% of simulations, compared to his implied odds of 48.78%. Click here to bet on Jeanty as a Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Rome Odunze, Bears (+125)Odunze was a touchdown-scoring machine to begin the season, scoring at least once in each of the first four games of the year. He's gone scoreless over his last three weeks, though, but he remains a featured part of the offense, averaging seven targets per game over that span. The No. 9 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft had seven receptions for 114 yards on 10 targets last week against the Ravens, and he's been Chicago's leading receiver in three of seven games this season. Starting running back D'Andre Swift (groin) is out, which could lead to more passing against the Bengals, who have the worst scoring defense in the NFL. The Bengals are allowing 31.6 ppg, including 39 points to the previously winless Jets last week. The model projects Odunze to score in 64% of simulations, returning strong value at +125 odds. Click here to bet on Odunze as a Week 9 anytime touchdown scorer at FanDuel, where new users receive $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 bet wins. Want more Week 9 NFL picks?You've seen the model's NFL picks for some top anytime touchdown scorer NFL player props for Week 9.

    "body": "\n        A potential SEC and College Football Playoff elimination game headlines on Saturday night in Knoxville when No. 14 Tennessee hosts No. 18 Oklahoma under the lights at Neyland Stadium. It's the Vols' first and only home night game of the season as they return from a bounce-back win at Kentucky looking to keep their postseason hopes alive.Oklahoma, meanwhile, is seeking a rebound of its own after a 34-26 home loss to Ole Miss last week -- its second defeat in three games. The Sooners now face a must-win stretch to close the regular season, with upcoming matchups against No. 4 Alabama and No. 19 Missouri in addition to Saturday's trip to Knoxville.Click here to bet Tennessee vs. Oklahoma at Bet365 Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets using the bonus code CBSBET365:The programs met last season for the first time as SEC foes, with Tennessee winning 25-15 in Norman. It was an emotional night for Vols coach Josh Heupel, who returned to the stadium where he was once an All-American quarterback and national champion for the Sooners. Overall, Oklahoma leads the all-time series 3-2, with an Orange Bowl victory in 1967 and regular-season wins in 2014 and 2015.\n  Oklahoma vs. Tennessee: Need to know  Battle of the SEC's best: This game features a best-on-best matchup in the SEC when it comes to Tennessee's offense going head-to-head against Oklahoma's defense. Heading into the weekend, Tennessee has the SEC's No. 1 scoring offense, total offense and passing offense while the Sooners boast the SEC's No. 1 scoring defense, total defense and passing defense. It's the kind of game where the direct battle between some of the sport's elite units decide the winner or a situation where one team's supposed \"weaker\" unit rises up to make the difference in a huge conference win.  Battle of sack machines: Both defensive fronts have been among the best in the country when it comes to getting after and bringing down the quarterback. Oklahoma enters the weekend ranked No. 2 in the SEC and tied for No. 2 nationally with 29 sacks on the year, while Tennessee is No. 4 in the SEC and No. 7 nationally with 27 sacks so far in 2025. Considering the playmaking ability of both quarterbacks, it serves as an X-factor that cuts both ways in the matchup. Both offensive lines will need to protect their quarterback to give them a chance to make plays and both defensive fronts looking to neutralize the offensive explosiveness by speeding up the quarterback's clock with pressure in the backfield. Oklahoma cashes in on scoring opportunities: The dual-threat playmaking of quarterback John Mateer has made Oklahoma particularly difficult to stop in the red zone, leading to the Sooners having one of the best red zone offenses in the country. Oklahoma is one of just three teams nationally to score on every red zone opportunity, scoring 19 touchdowns and kicking seven field goals across its 26 red zone attempts. That strength should be a particular concern for Tennessee, which enters the week ranked No. 125 nationally in opponents red zone conversion rate. \n  Where to watch Oklahoma vs. Tennessee live  Date: Saturday, Nov. 1 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ET  Location: Neyland Stadium -- Knoxville, Tenn.  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Oklahoma vs. Tennessee prediction, picks  \nThe Josh Heupel involvement has made this one of the great new rivalries post-SEC expansion, and if his emotional locker room moment last year didn't drive it home enough, this result will back up his desire to beat the Sooners. Neyland Stadium should be rocking under the lights and a Tennessee defense that has been a bit boom or bust throughout the season could find success flipping Oklahoma turnovers into easy points in a crucial win for the Vols' playoff hopes. Pick: Tennessee -3 \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom

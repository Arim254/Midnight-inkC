    "body": "\n        One of the most popular forms of sports betting is prop betting, which involves wagering on a specific outcome usually not tied to the overall game result. When you bet on a point spread, total or money line, you are wagering on a game outcome while a prop bet is a more targeted wager looking at one area, usually a particular statistical category. The lines for prop bets are derived from oddsmakers in a similar way to game lines. We'll take a look at what prop betting is, how it works and some of the best strategies when betting on props at the best sportsbook apps. Bet props at DraftKings Sportsbook:Types of propsPlayer PropsThere are many types of prop bets you can make at top sportsbooks, but the most common one is a player prop bet. This involves betting on a particular player's production for a specific statistic. The Philadelphia Eagles played the Dallas Cowboys in Week 1 of the 2025 NFL season, and let's say you wanted to bet on Dak Prescott's passing yards. DraftKings allows you to pick a yardage total you'd like to bet on and gives dynamic odds for different totals. For example, you could bet on Prescott to throw for 240+ yards at -147 (wager $147 to win $100), but if you increase that number to 250+ yards, the odds go to -116 (wager $116 to win $100). If you went down to 230+ yards, the odds move to -187 (wager $187 to win $100). Player props are especially popular in NBA betting and sportsbook promos.Game PropsGame props are also offered, and they usually involve statistical achievements either team can reach or a combination of both teams. Using the same Eagles vs. Cowboys example, DraftKings offers a game prop for either team to score 30+ points with \"Yes\" priced at -110 and \"No\" priced at -120. If you bet \"Yes\", you'll win as long as either the Eagles or Cowboys score 30 points, regardless of the game's outcome. If you bet \"No\", you'll win if both teams score fewer than 30 points. There are also game props for total touchdowns scored, how many yards the longest touchdown scored will account for and which team gets to certain points milestones first.Team PropsTeam props are similar to game props, but they only involve one team rather than both. With the same Eagles vs. Cowboys example, you can bet on how many points and touchdowns one team will score, along with more unique outcomes such as whether a team will post a shutout or if a team will come from behind to win the game.There are also season-long props available, which usually involve player statistics. These could be a player's passing yards, points scored, goals scored, or even fouls committed during an entire season.Bet different prop bet types at FanDuel Sportsbook here:Understanding prop betting odds in different sports and leaguesIn most cases, the four major sports leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL) have similar prop betting markets available for every game and for futures. Here's a look at some examples of prop bets in different leagues and how to read lines on prop bets.NFL prop bettingUsing the above Eagles vs. Cowboys game prop example for either team to score 30+ points, both sides were fairly even at -110 and -120. This means the oddsmakers are pricing this close to 50-50 on whether a team scores 30+, but there's a slight lean towards neither team hitting that mark. If you go to either team to score 40+ points, \"Yes' jumps to +550 and \"No\" goes to -1000. A \"+\" sign indicates that side of the prop is seen as less likely to hit in the eyes of the oddsmakers, while the \"-\" is seen as more likely. -110 odds are standard when both sides are equal, and slight deviations from this number shouldn't be weighed heavily if both sides of the prop remain at \"-\" odds.NBA prop bettingLet's look at a season-long prop example for the NBA. The reigning champions Oklahoma City Thunder had a win total for the 2025-26 season set at 62.5 (Over +100, Under -120) at DraftKings. If the Thunder win 63+ games, all bets on the Over will cash. If the Thunder win 62 or fewer games, the Under will cash. Since there's a +100 on the Over side at the moment, the odds imply Oklahoma City is less likely to win 63 or more games, but it's close.NHL prop bettingWe'll look at an awards prop in the NHL. Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid is the favorite to win the Hart Trophy, which is given to the league MVP,  in 2025-26 at DraftKings. However, he's priced at +200 while the next player, Colorado Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon, is priced at +600. This is an instance where even the favorite is at plus odds. Because only one player can win MVP, it's harder to pinpoint who will have a dominant season and get the most votes. As games are played, the lines in this market will shift and eventually somebody will become the clear odds-on favorite.MLB prop bettingSportsbooks offer plenty of MLB player props, which are predominantly divided between batters and pitchers. Let's use a pitching prop as an example here and say Detroit Tigers ace Tarik Skubal's strikeouts line for a particular game is set at 8.5 (Over +110, Under -145). This means the odds imply Skubal is more likely to tally eight or fewer strikeouts in this outing. These lines can change based on how the market is betting on a prop. If there's more action from respected bettors on the Under leading up to the game, oddsmakers will usually shift the odds to incentivize betting on the Over to balance their risk.Skubal's performance in this game could impact future strikeout prop lines. If he were to strike out 12 batters in this game, it's possible oddsmakers will raise his strikeouts prop line for the next game to 9.5 or even 10.5. If he were to only tally four strikeouts, the line could be lowered to 7.5 for the next contest.Prop bets are also available for sports like soccer, golf and tennis. These can be goal scorers in soccer, how many shots a particular hole will take for a golfer to complete and how many sets a tennis player will win during a particular match.Use the promo code CBSBET365 and sign up for Bet365 Sportsbook for more prop betting:Special laws for prop betting in college sportsMany states have sports betting regulations that prohibit wagering on college sports. For example, in Illinois, bettors cannot wager on college teams from the state or games involving college teams from the state, but can wager on college teams outside of the state and games involving two teams outside of the state. This also occurs with prop bets. The thinking behind this is that \"unpaid\" college athletes could be more likely to intentionally game the system on one side of a prop bet to make money through intermediaries. With the rise of NIL money in addition to athletic scholarships, this could theoretically be less of a concern in the future since athletes don't need to engage in fixing games for personal gain. Nonetheless, some states still restrict betting on college sports in some fashion. Those states are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington D.C., Washington and Wisconsin.Best sportsbook to bet propsYou can bet on props at nearly every sportsbook and it's important to make sure you're looking at multiple books to get the best value. Some sportsbooks will have slight adjustments on props when it comes to the lines, while others may have entirely different values for the props themselves.Tips and advice for prop betting Because there's so much data available, player prop betting is usually more favorable than betting on game or team props. Player props do carry injury risk, especially if you're venturing into awards and futures props, but bettors can generally get enough information to make educated wagers on a game-to-game basis. Some sportsbooks have programs where bettors can get insurance for players leaving early in games with injuries, which makes betting on Overs for player props more enticing.NBA player prop betting can be particularly profitable, as there are multiple games over the course of a week. For example, Nikola Jokic had a stretch of five consecutive triple-doubles in the 2024-25 season, and those who kept backing Jokic to record a triple-double likely saw huge returns. Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett recorded a sack for eight straight games in the regular season during his record-breaking 2026 campaign. While the oddsmakers likely adjusted lines to the sacks where there wasn't much of a return on Garrett's sacking a quarterback, the winnings added up for bettors who backed Garrett.If there is one sport where player props might not be as favorable, it's hitter props in baseball. Batters usually get three or four plate appearances in any given game, and there's unnecessary risk in limiting your prop bet to those three or four outcomes. In NFL, NBA and NHL games, players are usually in action for larger periods of time and have more opportunities to connect on their particular player props.Generally, betting Overs is the trend for the public. Therefore, there's inherent value in betting unders for player props. Across the full season, unders on NFL player props have cashed on nearly 60% of wagers for multiple seasons.FAQWhat does prop mean in betting?A prop is a specific outcome usually involving a player or team, but can include multiple teams. It is usually not tied to the game result (spread, total, money line).What are NBA prop bets?NBA prop bets usually refer to NBA player props, which are considered among the most popular bets. These are predictions for players to go Over or Under in particular statistical categories. However, NBA prop bets can also be team win totals, awards and whether a team makes the playoffs or not.What is the best prop betting site?All top sportsbooks offer props in some fashion, though the lines and odds may be slightly different at each one. It's important to look at multiple sportsbooks to see if there's better value being offered at one over the other but there's no consensus \"best\" prop betting site.What is a receiving prop?A receiving prop is seen in football and involves offensive skill players who catch the ball. These can be running backs, receivers or tight ends. Receiving props are usually limited to receiving yards and receptions, as receiving touchdowns would fall under \"touchdown scorer\" props.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As sports betting continues to gain popularity across the country with more and more states legalizing the activity, aspiring bettors have a wealth of information available to them when it comes to the best approaches to sports betting strategies. We'll take a look at some general betting strategies, sport-specific approaches and guidelines for different types of wagers.A sports betting strategy is any approach to sports betting, whether it's maintaining a particular wager amount, betting on a particular sport or avoiding certain markets. While these strategies may not provide you with an eye-catching payout and get you featured on social media channels, they are more likely to lead to long-term success and ensure responsible gaming. Sign up for DraftKings Sportsbook and put your betting strategies to work:What are some general betting strategies?The first and most important strategy is to make sure you know what you're betting on. This may seem obvious, but even the best handicappers can get tripped up. A good example of this is when wagering on soccer. Bettors will often be presented with three options: Team A to win, Team B to win or a draw. These bets are for regular time only, and sportsbooks will specify this in the bet slip. This is especially important to note in competitions with knockout games, as a team winning in extra time in a knockout match will not count towards a wager on that team to win the match on the three-way money line. There are additional soccer betting markets where bettors can account for this, so be sure to know what you're betting on.A secondary component here is to know the sport you are betting on, especially because there are so many sports globally you can make wagers on. For example, if you've never watched cricket, it would not be wise to bet on cricket matches. That doesn't mean you can't get lucky and win some wagers, but it's generally not advised.Managing your bankroll is important in order to game responsibly. Do not wager more than you are willing to lose, and do not chase your losses. Sometimes, you may feel more confident about a particular wager and bet more than your usual amount. This can work from time to time, but in general it's best to use the same wager amount for each bet to ensure long-term success.Line shopping is another important strategy. While most top sportsbooks offer similar odds, there can occasionally be some discrepancies from platform to platform. This won't matter for one or two bets, but over the long haul, it could lead to a sizable difference in winnings. If you're going to make a wager, you might as well get the best possible payout.A secondary component of this betting strategy is to monitor line movement. For example, if you want to bet on the Eagles to win against the Cowboys at DraftKings Sportsbook at -325 in the morning and the line moves to Eagles -150 two hours before kickoff, make sure to see why the line has shifted and whether you would still like to keep your bet at -325 or cash out if your sportsbook offers this option. If the line movement is that sizable, there's likely injury news or a lineup change which could materially impact the result of the contest.Fading the public is a popular strategy, but how can bettors actually do that? There are websites which can tell you where the majority of bets are going for a particular market, and sportsbooks have started providing that information as well. Sometimes, there's a lot of momentum with one team which isn't actually merited by statistical evidence. This is particularly true in college basketball during the NCAA Tournament, where upsets are common. You can fade big-time programs in a variety of ways, often going against the betting public, and get rewarded for it.Hedging is when you place a wager on both sides of an outcome, effectively protecting yourself from a major loss. It's a way to give yourself some protection against some of your bets not hitting. This can be applicable to all markets. For example, let's say you bet Eagles -7.5 against the Cowboys before the game and Philadelphia has a 14-0 lead at halftime. The live line at halftime is Eagles -10.5. You can bet the Cowboys side of the spread here to cover yourself in case Dallas comes back. There's a possibility you win both bets if the Eagles win by 8-10 points, but you've already got Eagles -7.5 in the bank if Philadelphia goes on to blow out the Cowboys. Betting Dallas on the live line hedges your original bet and while you eat into your potential profit, you also minimize the potential loss.Now that you know general betting strategies, sign up for bet365 Sportsbook with the promo code CBSBET365:Do specific strategies work for specific sports?NFL betting strategies Finding a strategy that works for you is important. but there are some general guidelines when it comes to specific sports for betting. In NFL betting, it's usually wise to back the home team in some fashion. Home teams tend to win more than road teams, even if the talent gap is substantial. Betting on the home team against the spread or on the money line is generally a good way to stay profitable, even if it takes many wagers to see decent returns.College football betting strategies When it comes to college football betting, slightly modifying the NFL betting approach can be successful. Betting on home underdogs in college football might not pay off every week, but there are enough upsets over the course of the season where this tends to even out the wins and losses. There are certain weeks where there may not seem like an obvious upset pick but this is the ultimate chaos sport. Those massive upsets can make up for your misses. The same goes for college basketball, where home teams often feed off the crowd to a greater extent than in other sports and can pull off stunning victories.NBA betting strategiesIn NBA betting, player props are the most popular types of wagers. Because basketball players tend to play every few days, it's more likely for positive or negative form to carry over across multiple games. For example, Nikola Jokic had a stretch of five straight triple-doubles in 2025. If you wagered on Jokic to record a triple-double in each of those contests, you'd make a decent profit even if you also bet on the sixth triple-double, which did not occur.MLB betting strategiesPlayer props are available in every league, but they are riskier in MLB betting and NHL betting. In baseball, hitters usually get three to four plate appearances in a game. Even the best hitters can have off days and the randomness of three or four individual matchups is usually not worth pursuing. There are plenty of MLB player props available outside of hitting props and the odds account for the limited number of chances a player gets, but there's still a greater amount of risk compared to player props in other sports. NHL betting strategiesA similar phenomenon occurs in hockey, where the best players only tend to play for 45-50 seconds at a time before getting a breather. This doesn't mean you can't find great information on specific matchups in baseball betting, or target a team's most important player in hockey betting. It just means you are leaving things more to chance compared to a game result. However, the points prop market for hockey is potentially more favorable because of the way players record points. Up to two assists can be awarded on every hockey goal, which means as many as three players can record a point on every goal scored. That helps your chances when betting on a player points prop in hockey betting.Soccer betting strategiesSoccer betting offers goal-scorer props but these carry the same risk as player props in MLB betting and NHL betting. Bettors are more likely to get good results wagering on team results. One market in soccer betting which can be favorable is the double chance, which gives users multiple outcomes to bet on in a single slip. This tends to work well when backing a home underdog to either win or draw, and there's usually still a solid payout associated with this type of wager.Golf betting strategiesWagering on a winner for a tournament in golf betting, even when there's a clear favorite, can be a futile exercise given how many competitors there are in the field. Markets for top-5 and top-10 finishes are usually more favorable, even if the payout is lower. You can also wait for a few days to make wagers, as golf tournaments usually take place across multiple days. If a player you are targeting makes it past the cut for the first few rounds, you can likely still get a decent price to back him even on the later days of the competition.MMA betting strategiesMMA betting and UFC betting have gained popularity over the last few years with the sport generating substantial buzz internationally. One of the most crucial things to check when betting on MMA and UFC is fighter statistics. You can find out how many bouts a certain fighter has won and which method they've won with. There are markets where you can wager on the method of victory and in most cases, fighters do not change their style from bout to bout. If they are winning a large majority of their fights in a particular way, they are likely to keep that style moving forward.Bet football, basketball, baseball and more at Caesars Sportsbook:Do different bet types require different strategies?There's no consensus approach to betting point spreads, run lines and puck lines but it's generally better to back the favorite. Favorites win a majority of the time and sportsbooks offer strong payouts on run lines and puck lines for favorites. There's a wealth of information on how teams perform against the spread in each situation, and you can find this information quite easily before placing a wager. In certain sports, like college football, NBA and college basketball, it makes sense to back the underdog on the spread in certain cases, particularly if the underdog is at home. You might not want to back the upset with a money line wager, so you can give yourself some breathing room with a spread bet.The same goes for totals and player props. Most sportsbooks now give you the opportunity to bet alternate lines at different odds, so you can modify spreads, totals and prop lines to your liking. Even if you sacrifice a bit with the odds, you can lower the thresholds which need to be crossed in order to have more success.Futures betting can be tricky, especially if you're banking on a team making certain improvements which haven't materialized yet on the field. However, betting on a team with sustained success can be more profitable here. For example, the Pittsburgh Steelers have had 22 consecutive non-losing seasons. While that alone doesn't guarantee anything for the 2026-27 NFL season, what's most likely to occur? The Steelers are +450 (wager $100 to win $450) to win the AFC North in 2026-27.Parlay betting and same-game parlays have become wildly popular, and it can be tempting to try to hit a massive 10-leg parlay when you see bettors being featured on sportsbook social media accounts for turning $10 wagers into thousands of dollars thanks to parlays. However, it is generally advised to avoid parlaying. This is because not only do you need every outcome of the bet to be correct to win (even one wrong result in 5-6 legs can ruin the entire bet), but sportsbooks often do not give you correct odds relative to your chances to win.For example, the implied win probability of parlaying two legs at -110 odds each is 25%, as you've got a 50% chance of hitting each part of the wager correctly (0.5x0.5 = 0.25). The associated odds with this would be +300, but sportsbooks typically offer around +264 or +265 for this wager. So not only are you increasing your risk of losing, but you're also curtailing your payout slightly when compared to what the probability says the odds should be. If you do bet parlays, it's advised not to go beyond four legs. While there are larger payouts for each added leg, this is not sustainable over the long haul and can lead to irresponsible gaming habits like chasing losses.If you do want to bet parlays, the best strategy would be to have four or fewer legs and back big favorites in each leg. Even if you do not get substantial odds, you will have a greater chance at long-term success with parlay betting if you minimize the opportunities to get things wrong.Are there any strategies that should be avoided for sports betting?Most of these have been mentioned in the article and fall under the umbrella of responsible gaming. Make sure you know what you're making a wager on. Make sure you understand the sport you are wagering on. Do not chase losses and only bet what you are willing to lose. Make sure to shop across sportsbooks for the best lines for a particular wager. In general, try to avoid betting on parlays or keep the number of legs to four or fewer.FAQWhat are sports betting handicapping strategies?Sports betting handicapping strategies are tactics used by gamblers to try to get the most value for their bets. These can range from general tips like wagering the same amount on each bet or only betting one particular market, to sport-specific guidelines like wagering primarily on NBA player props or betting on home teams in the NFL.What is the most successful sports betting strategy?There's no such thing as a \"most successful\" sports betting strategy, but there are general approaches which work well for most bettors. Keep in mind, the vast majority of those engaging in sports betting are losing money. Otherwise, sportsbooks wouldn't be operating. If you enter sports betting with the mindset of getting rich quick, you're likely to be disappointed. If you go in with a disciplined approach hoping to make money over a long-term horizon, you're more likely to have success.

    "body": "\n        The Women's National Basketball Players Association delivered a new collective bargaining agreement proposal to the WNBA on Tuesday. While it offered concessions on revenue sharing and housing, the league was unmoved and called the offer \"unrealistic,\" while warning that the two sides were \"running out of time\" to get a deal done and ensure the 2026 season goes ahead as planned. Notably, the players have dropped their revenue sharing target from an average of 31% of gross revenue over the course of the agreement (with a $10.5 million salary cap in 2026) to an average of 27.5% of the gross revenue over the course of the agreement (with a $9.5 million salary cap in 2026), as first reported by ESPN and confirmed by CBS Sports. Additionally, the players want housing to be provided to everyone in the first few years of the deal, but put forth a plan to phase it out for those on guaranteed multi-year deals that are close to the max. Within hours, the WNBA had released a strongly worded statement. \"The Players Association's latest proposal remains unrealistic and would cause hundreds of millions of dollars of losses for our teams,\" a WNBA spokesperson told CBS Sports. \"We still need to complete two Drafts and free agency before the start of training camp and are running out of time.  We believe the WNBA's proposal would result in a huge win for current players and generations to come.\"A source with knowledge of the situation indicated that the WNBPA's proposal would result in projected losses of $460M over the lifetime of the agreement for the league's teams, but it's unclear how that calculation was made. Throughout this process, the players have accused the league of a lack of transparency. \nThe WNBA's most recent proposal arrived on Feb. 7, following an in-person meeting between key stakeholders in New York on Feb. 2. The league had previously sought to end all housing benefits, but offered its own concessions on housing in the Feb. 7 offer. First-year players and players on a minimum salary would be provided a one-bedroom apartment for the first three years of the CBA, while developmental players would be provided a studio apartment, a source familiar with the negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports. (The league previously agreed to create two new developmental player roster spots, a source familiar with the negotiations confirmed to CBS Sports. Those players would receive a stipend, plus money for each game appearance, but would be limited to a certain number of appearances.)The WNBA has provided housing for players since 1999. In the most recent CBA, teams were required to offer players a one-bedroom apartment or a stipend for housing costs. \nHousing and revenue sharing remain the two biggest disagreements between the two sides. While the players' most recent proposal lowers their revenue sharing target, they are still asking for a share of gross revenue, while the league is offering a share of net revenue -- that is, the revenue remaining when league-specified operating expenses are removed from the pot.The league's Feb. 7 proposal offered a $5.65 million salary cap in 2026, with an average player salary of more than $535,000 and a max salary of nearly $1.3 million. For comparison, in 2025, the WNBA's salary cap was about $1.5 million, the minimum salary was around $66,000 and its supermax was about $250,000.\n\n        \n            \n                WNBA, players make CBA progress as Breanna Stewart opens up on process that has taken 'way longer' than needed\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLast month, the WNBA announced the full schedule for the 2026 season. Training camps are scheduled to begin on April 19, with preseason games to begin on April 25 and opening night set for May 8. With just over two months until training camps are supposed to open, the two sides not only have to come to terms on a new CBA, but hold a double expansion draft for the Toronto Tempo and Portland Fire, and conduct the busiest free agency period in league history.\"Time is of the essence,\" WNBPA vice president Breanna Stewart told CBS Sports earlier this month. \"I think that both sides are very aware that this has gone on way longer than it needed to. But hopefully we can really start to be hearing each other and they hear us on things that are non-negotiables.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The middle of February may seem too early for Fantasy Football projections. 'Seem' may not be a strong enough word in that first sentence. Free agency is right around the corner, but the NFL Draft won't happen for two more months. It is way too early. But that doesn't mean it isn't helpful to take a snapshot before things get crazy.The first thing you notice when you look at the projections below is that we have more job openings than good starting quarterbacks. Considering that Francisco Mendoza is the only projected starter in the upcoming draft, and I have five teams below projected with no starting quarterback, we should expect some shuffling of the deck chairs in 2026. Kyler Murray, Tua Tagovailoa, and Aaron Rodgers aren't listed below, but if they want to start in 2026, I would expect they get the chance. I do currently have Michael Penix Jr., Jacoby Brissett, J.J. McCarthy, and Shedeur Sanders projected as starters, but not with anything close to certainty. Maybe Deshaun Watson or Kirk Cousins get another shot.The second thing this process is helpful for is noticing the tiers at the top of the rankings. Josh Allen projects for 16 more Fantasy points than any other QB, but QB2 through QB7 are projected within 15 points of each other. In a recent CBS mock draft, both Jalen Hurts and Dak Prescott fell to Round 8, and they are both in the second tier of these projections. If that trend holds in July, then the back end of that second tier will be my favorite place to draft a quarterback.One final thing that may stick out to you is the fact that Patrick Mahomes is currently projected as QB19. The first point about this is that projections are not the same as rankings, and I will rank Mahomes significantly higher based on his upside. But specifically to Mahomes, I don't think him missing time early in the season is actually the biggest risk. The biggest risk is that in his first year back after an ACL injury, Mahomes will be less mobile. This could show up in two places. One, most obvious, is that Mahomes' rushing production could crater. He rushed for a career-high 422 yards and five touchdowns last year. He has run for at least 300 yards in six straight seasons. We should not be surprised if he struggles to reach 200 yards rushing next year. The second risk is that Mahomes' lack of mobility negatively affects his ability to buy time in the pocket, and he takes more sacks and is less effective under pressure.\nThose risks result in a lower projection, particularly since we still don't know if Mahomes will be ready for Week 1. But I would draft him higher than his projection because of upside. Other QBs I would draft higher than their projection below are Jaxson Dart and Caleb Williams. Earlier this month, I had Jay Felicio from QB List on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty to discuss the state of the quarterback position in Dynasty. Check it out:\nBelow is my first run at 2026 QB projections. These projections will be updated as we get information on free agency and the 2026 NFL Draft.\n            ",

You can sign up to get it in your inbox every weekday morning here. \nGood morning and happy Wednesday! Carter Bahns here on the heels of a momentous day in baseball, MMA and soccer. We'll discuss all those big stories and more on this hump day, but before we go any further, here's a name you'll want to know today and throughout the rest of the week: Alysa Liu. Liu opened the women's singles competition with her short program yesterday and is poised to become one of Team USA's biggest breakout stars. Jasmyn Wimbish wrote a terrific feature on the 20-year-old. I highly suggest you give it a read. And here's where you can track today's Olympics action. With that, let's go.  ⚾ Five things to know Wednesday Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano are coming out of retirement. Two MMA legends will return to the cage for a five-round fight on May 16 under Most Valuable Promotions. Rousey, a UFC Hall of Famer and the first female fighter to sign with the promotion, will fight for the first time in nearly a decade while Carano is set to break a 17-year hiatus. The event, which features two of the biggest names in women's combat sports history, is set to unfold at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California.MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark resigned. Clark reportedly stepped down after an internal investigation revealed an \"inappropriate\" relationship with his sister-in-law. The timing of his resignation could not come at a more pivotal moment for the MLBPA, which is in the midst of a federal investigation into financial impropriety and is about to engage in potentially tense negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement. The present CBA expires Dec. 1, and a realistic threat of a lockout looms. A change in leadership only complicates matters and is the latest reason why the start of the 2027 season is already in jeopardy.Team USA picked up two silver medals and opened the women's figure skating competition. The Americans added to their third-place overall medal count tally with podium finishes in the men's freeski big air and men's speedskating team pursuit. Mac Forehand excelled in the former while Team USA finished behind only Italy in the latter. No medals were on the line quite yet in women's figure skating, but the competition was the marquee event of the evening and saw two-thirds of the \"Blade Angels\" put on a show. Alysa Liu stands in third place heading into Thursday's free skate while Isabeau Levito resides in eighth. Things, unfortunately, did not go according to plan for Amber Glenn as she slipped to 13th after backing out of one of her jumps. Here's what to watch as Olympic action continues today, and here's where you can follow all of the day's action.Michigan notched the biggest win of the day in college basketball. It was another statement victory for the top-ranked Wolverines, who built a commanding early lead on No. 7 Purdue in a hostile road environment and rolled to a 91-80 triumph -- their sixth straight double-digit win. Matt Norlander has more on the big game. Dusty May's squad improved to 9-0 in Quad 1 opportunities ahead of Saturday's non-conference battle with No. 3 Duke. Elsewhere, No. 16 North Carolina was all kinds of overwhelmed in an 82-52 rivalry loss at NC State, marking its largest loss in the series since 1962. Also, unranked Iowa defeated No. 9 Nebraska, 57-52.Real Madrid and PSG were victorious in UEFA Champions League playoff matches. Real Madrid's 1-0 win over Benfica in the knockout stage playoff was soured, however, by an alleged racial incident involving Vinicius Junior which led to a delay of nearly 12 minutes. In other action, Juventus fell on their face in a 5-2 loss to Galatasaray in the most lopsided first-leg match of the playoff round. Four more men's matches are on the docket today, while the women's knockout playoffs feature a pair of second-leg contests. 📈📉 Do not miss this: First NBA front office rankings of 2026 \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            With the NBA trade deadline in the rearview mirror, it's time for Sam Quinn to deliver his biannual front office rankings. This analysis of organizations' abilities to construct competitive rosters comes every February and July after the trade deadline and free agency, and once again, the Thunder stand atop the league with the best and brightest braintrust in basketball. The Thunder and Celtics have been Nos. 1 and 2 in every edition of the front office rankings, and there is no reason to downgrade them as they remain two of the top championship contenders on the heels of prolific 2024-25 runs. So let's look elsewhere. \nBiggest riser: Hornets (up eight spots)Biggest fallers: Clippers, Magic (down six spots)Why is the needle pointing upward in Charlotte? Quinn: \"The Hornets are on a heater. Their 2024 draft hasn't given them much (though there have been recent signs of life from Tidjane Salaun!), but they went 3 for 3 in 2025. Sion James and Ryan Kalkbrenner both have obvious niches as long-term role players, but the real win was Kon Knueppel.\" 🔠 MLB offseason grades: Dodgers pass with flying colors, Twins fail \n                                                                    Imagn Images\n                                                            Full-squad workouts are underway at spring training sites across Major League Baseball, and with that, the offseason is effectively over. Which clubs aced it on the hot stove and which enter 2026 with more questions than answers? Our offseason report card puts a bow on a busy winter that saw the Dodgers and Mariners come out as the biggest winners. Dayn Perry explained why the Dodgers' \"A\" grade is a no-brainer. Perry: \"The back-to-back champs remain the standard when it comes to investing in on-field success. Rather than rest on their substantial laurels this winter, the Dodgers went out and signed the best free agent available (Kyle Tucker) and landed an upgrade at closer (Edwin Díaz).\"All but two teams received passing grades. The Twins were one of those that flunked, as they received an \"F\" for failing to fully embrace a rebuild. And our panel of MLB experts is tepid on the Giants after their hiring of manager Tony Vitello and some underwhelming roster moves. \n 👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            Mike Evans has at least another year in him. The legendary Buccaneers wide receiver reportedly plans to play in 2026 and will explore his options as an unrestricted free agent.Robert Woods, meanwhile, is calling it a career.

Now playing hosts, Juventus have more to play for after last week's dramatic 2-2 draw in Germany. Despite carrying a 2-0 lead late in the match, the Serie A side couldn't regain momentum after conceding a penalty and will need to show they can start and finish Champions League games with authority. Newly acquired Ana Capeta was a key figure in attacking sequences, getting on the scoreboard first and then providing an assist on Amalie Vangsgaard's goal. The group will need more from veterans Cristina Girelli and Barbara Bonansea.Meanwhile, Wolfsburg will want a better start to their second leg after trailing for 85 minutes of the first leg. After Janina Minge's penalty, Sarai Linder's dazzling equalizer leveled things for Wolfsburg, but the group will need to figure things out quicker at home. Some more string pulling in the midfield by Minge and pushing veteran Alex Popp higher could be a welcome adjustment. Will the real Real Madrid please stand up: The Madristas hold a slim one-goal advantage as they head back for the home leg at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano. They finally can say they defeated Paris FC in a Champions League match, and now they'll have to show they can do it again. Caroline Weir, recently named Scotland captain, has been an offensive generator. She leads the team with four goals in the tournament, and her creativity will be necessary. Colombian international Linda Caicedo is a commanding presence on the pitch with her skill and dribbling on the flank; she leads the group in assists in this competition. With Paris FC likely to chase the game from the first whistle, both Wier and Caicedo will need to strike fear into the Parisians' hearts first. Look ahead to the quarterfinals: The four winners will join FC Barcelona, Chelsea FC, OL Lyonnes, and Bayern Munich in the quarterfinals. The draw is already set: Arsenal/Leuven winner faces Chelsea, Real Madrid/Paris FC winner meets Barcelona, Wolfsburg/Juventus winner takes on OL, and Manchester United/Atlético winner faces Bayern Munich.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Champions League knockout playoff between Benfica and Real Madrid was delayed by 10 minutes on Tuesday night after Vinicius Junior reported an alleged racial incident. The Brazil attacker had just scored an outstanding opening goal in the 50th minute of the match in Lisbon's Estadio da Luz when anger built among home supporters, objects raining down on the pitch as Vinicius celebrated by the corner flag. The exuberance of his celebrations earned Vinicius a yellow card from referee Francois Letexier while tensions frayed between both sets of players.It was soon after that Vinicius sprinted over to Letexier and was seen pointing at Benfica player Gianluca Prestianni. The French referee made a gesture of crossed arms above his head, an initiative adopted by FIFA in 2024 to allow players and officials to signal that they believe racist abuse has taken place on the field. Television cameras caught Benfica forward Gianluca Prestianni speaking to Vinicius with his jersey covering his mouth; the Real Madrid man appeared to subsequently make reference to that while speaking to Letexier. Posting on his Instagram stories after the game, Vinicius said: \"Racists are, above all, cowards. They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are. But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened today is new in my life and my family's.\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose. I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\nFIFA president Gianna Infantino chimed in on Wednesday morning as the sport's global governing body released a statement:\"I was shocked and saddened to see the incident of alleged racism towards Vinícius Júnior in the UEFA Champions League match between SL Benfica and Real Madrid CF.    There is absolutely no room for racism in our sport and in society – we need all the relevant stakeholders to take action and hold those responsible to account.    At FIFA, through the Global Stand Against Racism and the Players' Voice Panel, we are committed to ensuring that players, officials and fans are respected and protected, and that appropriate action is taken when incidents occur. I commend referee François Letexier for activating the anti-racism protocol by using the arm gesture to stop the game and address the situation.    FIFA and football shows full solidarity to victims of racism and any form of discrimination. I will always continue to reiterate: No to racism! No to any form of discrimination!\"  Speaking after the game, several visiting players also alleged that Prestianni had racially abused their teammate.\"This can't happen,\" Aurelien Tchouameni told Movistar. \"Vini told us that the kid called him a 'monkey.' [Prestianni] said he didn't say anything, that he said ... I don't know, 'f--gots' or whatever.\"  Federico Valverde added, \"We don't know for sure, but according to all the teammates who were nearby, he said something nasty that shouldn't be said. We've been fighting for this for a long time. Vini has fought for this, and if this keeps happening, it's a shame that a camera didn't record it. \n\"If you cover your mouth to say something, it means what you're saying isn't right. It's a shame. I'm proud of the teammates who defended Vini and proud of Vini for carrying on.\"\nMeanwhile, a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card as tempers built across the field. Vinicius was spotted in an embrace with Jose Mourinho before sitting on the Madrid bench, the delay to proceedings running to 10 minutes before the match was resumed at the hour mark.Speaking after the game, Mourinho, who was sent off for a separate incident, revealed that he had told Vinicius that \"the last thing [Benfica] is is racist,\" pointing to the fact that their greatest ever player, Eusebio, was black. The Benfica head coach said he wished to remain \"independent\" in regards to what may have been said by Prestianni but criticised Vinicius for his celebrations.\n\"Unfortunately, he was not just happy to score the goal,\" Mourinho told Amazon. \"When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.\"When it was put to the former Real Madrid manager that Vinicius had suffered racist abuse on several other occasions during his career, Mourinho said, \"Stadiums that Vinicius plays in, something happens, always.\"\n        \n            \n                Thierry Henry on alleged racial incident involving Real Madrid star Vinicius Junior: 'We belong, right?'\n                \n                    Chuck Booth                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThough there were no further flashpoints between the players, Vinicius' every touch was booed by the Estadio da Luz and the game was stopped momentarily in the 96th minute as items were thrown onto the pitch by supporters and once again in the 103rd minute as 12 minutes of added time were issued. Madrid would ultimately hold onto their lead with relative ease.\n\"Disgraceful to the sport,\" was how Trent Alexander-Arnold described the incident to CBS Sports. \"It's disappointing. It's ruined the night. It's a disgrace to the sport and society. There's no place for it.\"If incidents like this do happen, we can only deal with it like we did tonight. Very proud of the team, the club and the squad, how everyone reacted and got around Vini. You can see it's something upsetting and disappointing. We reacted the right way, we kept our heads and kept calm. We defended each other and we also played very well.\"Vinicius has been racially abused on multiple occasions during his time as a Real Madrid player, particularly in 2023, when the incidents included an effigy of him being hung on a bridge in the Spanish capital before a match against Atletico Madrid. His campaigns against such intolerance and hatred have won the 25-year-old widespread admiration in the footballing world and beyond, with the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul implementing \"Vinicius Junior laws\" that will see sporting contests suspended over incidents of racist abuse.\nThe Brazilian football federation swiftly issued a statement of support for their star player. \"The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) stands in solidarity with Vinicius Junior, victim of yet another act of racism this Tuesday, after scoring for Real Madrid against Benfica in Lisbon. Racism is a crime. It is unacceptable. It cannot exist in football or anywhere else,\" the statement read.\"Vini, you are not alone. Your action in activating the protocol is an example of courage and dignity. We are proud of you. We will remain firm in the fight against all forms of discrimination. We are by your side. Always.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs restructured Patrick Mahomes' contract for the fourth consecutive season, according to Over The Cap, opening up tens of millions of dollars in salary cap space. Mahomes was scheduled to carry a $78.2 million cap hit in 2026, but the Chiefs converted $54.45 million of his salary into a signing bonus to lower his cap number to $34.65 million.The clearance of $43.65 million in cap space is the first step towards creating financial flexibility in what is a critical offseason for the Chiefs. They entered 2026 more than $57 million over the cap, limiting their ability to make necessary roster moves after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and failing to win the AFC West for the first time in the Mahomes era.With Mahomes coming off a torn ACL, there are no guarantees that he starts the 2026 season at full strength. His recovery timeline sets up for potential Week 1 availability, but that it is a question that emphasizes the Chiefs' need to build a roster capable of staying afloat if he misses time.While the contract adjustment lowers Mahomes' cap number in 2026, it also adds $10.98 million to his number for every year from 2027-31. He will carry an $85 million hit next season, setting the stage for yet another restructuring next winter.All of the adjustments to Mahomes' earnings are a product of his signing a monumental contract extension in 2020. His 10-year, $450 million deal was at the time the largest contract in American sports history. Making Mahomes the highest-paid player in the NFL was effectively a no-brainer given that he had established himself as both a league MVP and Super Bowl champion at that stage of what was already a legendary career. But it was also clear it would create financial stress down the line.Kansas City is now facing the repercussions of inking that historic deal.\nChiefs seek flexibility after down yearKansas City has until the start of the NFL league year on March 11 to get under the salary cap, so further moves are likely in store over the next couple of weeks. Over The Cap projects that even with Mahomes' contract restructuring, the Chiefs need to clear about $11 million worth of space. Defensive lineman Chris Jones could be next in line to have his contract adjusted, as he will carry a cap hit of approximately $45 million in 2026.Once the Chiefs get under the cap, they will have key personnel decisions to make as they seek to bounce back from an uncharacteristically poor campaign. The offense is not nearly as unstoppable as it was during the peak of Kansas City's league dominance, and it could benefit from upgrades at the skill positions to help once again get the most out of Mahomes. Uncertainty about whether Travis Kelce will return in 2026 further clouds the picture.Mahomes' contract creates challenges through 2031The Chiefs have managed to limit Mahomes' cap hit to no greater than $37.1 million in any year since he signed his lucrative contract. They have effectively delayed the inevitable, though, with their repeated restructuring. The three-time Super Bowl champion is running out of years onto which Kansas City can use to reduce their burden.Here is Mahomes' cap breakdown through 2031, per Spotrac:\nYearBase salaryCap hit2026$1.3 million$34.7 million2027$45.8 million$85.3 million2028$18 million$53 million2029$8 million$55.4 million2030$30.6 million$56.4 million2031$37.6 million$48.4 millionThe most logical solution is for Mahomes to sign another extension when first eligible in 2028. Tacking on additional years to his deal, and at a much lower salary, would provide the Chiefs the ability to further spread out his scheduled earnings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Northern Illinois coach Thomas Hammock is leaving the Huskies to join the Seattle Seahawks as an assistant, sources confirmed to CBS Sports. Hammock becomes the latest FBS head coach to depart his role in the ever-changing landscape of college football for a job in the NFL. The move comes at an awkward time for the program as Northern Illinois is in the midst of a move from the MAC to the Mountain West, where it is set to begin its first season as a member. That transition represents a significant competitive and operational shift for the Huskies, who will be tasked with adapting to longer travel, deeper conference competition and increased recruiting demands.Hammock has served as Huskies head coach since 2019. While Northern Illinois is coming off a 3‑9 finish in 2025, Hammock led the team to winning records three of the last five years and helped reestablish the Huskies as a consistent bowl participant. Under his leadership, Northern Illinois reached bowl games in 2021, 2023 and 2024, often exceeding pre-season expectations despite operating with a smaller budget than many of its opponents.Hammock also guided the Huskies to a MAC championship in 2021, one of the high points of the program's recent history. His most notable victory came in September 2024, when Northern Illinois defeated No. 5 Notre Dame -- a win often labeled an \"upset\" that Hammock rejected.\n\"If you go back and watch the game and put blank jerseys on both teams, you'd say it was a tremendous physical affair of teams going back and forth, and you can't tell which one has $20 million and which one don't,\" Hammock told CBS Sports' Chris Hummer.That win was Notre Dame's only loss of that season before it eventually reached the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.Before Northern Illinois, Hammock spent five seasons in the NFL as a running backs coach with the Baltimore Ravens. He began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Wisconsin in 2003‑04, then returned to his alma mater to coach running backs from 2005‑06. Hammock spent four seasons at Minnesota from 2007‑10 in various roles before returning to Wisconsin as assistant head coach and running backs coach from 2011‑13, building a reputation for developing productive running backs and disciplined offenses.\nHammock's tenure at Northern Illinois was also defined by his outspoken commentary on the state of college football. In August 2025, shortly after the NCAA further loosened restrictions on transfers and the growing influence of NIL and revenue-sharing deals, Hammock criticized the effect on programs outside the Power Five.\"Everyone's talking about everything else besides the most important thing of going to college,\" Hammock said at the time. \"Because if you're going to college to get a couple of dollars, you might as well go get a job. This is too hard to go get a couple of dollars. Learn the lessons that you need to learn to be successful in life for the next 40 or 50 years of your life. I would do it again for free because of the things I learned. That's why I'm standing here today, because of what I learned in college. Not because of how much someone gave me.\"Hammock's philosophy centered on building a sustainable program through recruiting high school talent and developing depth internally, rather than chasing transfers from larger programs. That approach allowed younger players to emerge late in the season and helped Northern Illinois sign two four-star recruits in 2025, a rarity for a Group of Six program.\nNavigating a move to the Mountain West ConferenceNorthern Illinois is set to join the Mountain West in 2026, ending a tenure in the MAC that dates back to 1997. They'll join UTEP, Air Force, Hawai'i, Nevada, New Mexico, San Jose State, UNLV, Wyoming and North Dakota State -- which recently made the jump from the FCS -- in the new-look conference. As Northern Illinois prepares for its first season in a new league, the search for Hammock's successor will be one of the program's most consequential decisions in recent years. The Huskies must now navigate conference realignment, roster turnover and elevated competition without the coach who has shaped their recent identity and development philosophy.\n            ",

Newcastle United will get to experience as they travel to Baku for the first leg of their Champions League knockout phase fixture to face Qarabag, who found form to sneak through the league phase, finishing 22nd, while the Magpies were unable to keep up with Paris Saint-Germain in an attempt to join the other four Premier League sides in the top eight, earning a spot in the round of 16.How to watch Qarabag vs. Newcastle United, oddsDate: Wednesday, Feb. 18 | Time: 12:45 p.m. ETLocation: Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium   -- Baku, AzerbaijanLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Qarabag +600; Draw +425; Newcastle United -263During the trip, one thing that could be on the back of Newcastle coach Eddie Howe's mind is that while the Toon will be the favorites facing Qarabag, they'll have additional pressure since all the other English sides are through. Chelsea or Barcelona loom for the winners of this two-legged tie, so it could also be an all-English affair in the round of 16, giving Newcastle familiarity if they are to make it through.Advancement shouldn't come as a formality, however. This Qarabag side have accomplished plenty of firsts in the competition so far, winning for the first time in UCL and becoming the first side from Azerbaijan to make it to the Champions League knockout phase. Seven first-team players are set to miss out for the Magpies despite the return of Joelinton to the squad. Needing to balance injury concerns with so many games in quick succession will be a challenge for Howe.\nBruno Guimaraes, Fabian Schar, Valentino Livramento, and Emil Krafth will all miss out, while Yoane Wissa, Sven Botman, and Lewis Miley are all doubts for the match, so rotation will be needed. All eyes will be on Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes, who have been pacing the attack, and Gordon can become the top scorer ever in Champions League history for the Magpies. Currently with six goals in the competition, he's level with Newcastle legend Alan Shearer and only one ahead of Barnes. If they can find the back of the net, it will be quite a memorable matchday. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        More than 150 quarterbacks changed locations at the FBS level during the 2026 transfer portal cycle. With the dust settled, it's now time to evaluate their fits. In the age of unfettered movement, quarterback transfers have never been more important. Last season, three of the four Heisman finalists were transfers. Seven of the 12 quarterbacks in the College Football Playoff were also transfers, along with every one that made the final four. With that said, we dug into the quarterbacks who will be the best fits at their next schools. Of course, many followed existing coaches or coordinators to new stops -- some are even bringing multiple members of their old offense -- which gives them a leg up. That said, plenty of others step into encouraging new situations where they can play their way onto the map. Here are 10 quarterbacks who will be great fits at their next schools and have a chance to shape the 2026 football season. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Drew Mestemaker, Oklahoma State2025 stats: 4,379 yards, 34 touchdowns, 9 interceptions, 68.9% completion at North TexasThere are multiple quarterbacks following their coach to new stops, but none lands in a better spot than Mestemaker. The former walk-on who never started a high school varsity game emerged as the most productive quarterback in America, and led UNT to the American title game. Now at Oklahoma State, he should be able to keep the magic going in the Big 12 with many of his top targets coming to Stillwater with him. Most importantly, coach Eric Morris and offensive coordinator Sean Brophy will be guiding him along. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Brendan Sorsby, Texas Tech2025 stats: 2,800 yards, 27 touchdowns, 5 interceptions, 580 yards rushing, 9 touchdowns at Cincinnati\nTexas Tech boasted the top offense in the Big 12 last season, but the offense sputtered at key moments. There's optimism around Lubbock that Sorsby is ready to take the unit to the next level. The Denton, Texas, native has garnered rave reviews for his high-level processing and brings a dual-threat component that will be welcome against elite opponents. Sorsby was rated the No. 2 overall player in the transfer portal. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Josh Hoover, Indiana2025 stats: 3,472 yards, 29 touchdowns, 13 interceptions, 65.9% completion at TCUHoover has been one of the most productive quarterbacks in college football over the past two years, but was often asked to do too much on a TCU team that struggled to run the ball. Now, the one-time Indiana commit enters one of the most structured offenses in college football. It's unlikely that Hoover will be able to match the Heisman output of outgoing quarterback Fernando Mendoza, but offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan has done a tremendous job putting quarterbacks in good positions. If Hoover can manage his turnover issues, he has a chance to be an elite quarterback. \n\n        \n            \n                Meet Drew Mestemaker: North Texas QB enjoying breakout after never starting varsity game in high school\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Sam Leavitt, LSU2025 stats: 1,628 yards, 10 touchdowns, 3 interceptions, 306 yards rushing, 5 touchdowns at Arizona StateFrom a career perspective, transfer more accomplished than Leavitt, the No. 1 player in the portal. The junior helped lead Arizona State to a historic Big 12 title in 2024 and led the Sun Devils to a 5-2 start last year before going down with a season-ending injury. LSU will give him a key opportunity to show off his talent, but it comes with some complications. The offensive line has a lot of work to do, and the wide receiver room is filled with newcomers. Leavitt has to be the one to figure it out. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Byrum Brown, Auburn2025 stats: 3,158 yards, 28 touchdowns, 7 interceptions, 1,008 yards rushing, 14 touchdowns at South Florida\nBrown was one of the top quarterbacks in the Group of Six last season. Now he has the opportunity to help turn around Auburn's offense. The Tigers failed to establish much of an offensive identity during the Hugh Freeze era, but Brown immediately fills many of the biggest holes. While his passing might be a work in progress at the SEC level, his physical running will help set a much higher floor than the Auburn units of years past. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Aidan Chiles, Northwestern2025 stats: 1,392 yards passing, 10 touchdowns, 3 interceptions, 227 yards rushing, 6 touchdowns at Michigan StateChiles has long been a mystery box, ultimately failing to wrangle his vast potential under Jonathan Smith at Michigan State. However, after calming his turnover issues, he finds himself in a perfect situation under first-year offensive coordinator Chip Kelly. Kelly has made a career of elevating dual-threat quarterbacks, and Chiles gives him plenty of tools to play with. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Jaden Craig, TCU2025 stats: 2,869 yards, 25 touchdowns, 7 interceptions at HarvardCraig has been an intriguing name on NFL Draft radars for a while. Now he gets the chance to prove himself at the major college level. At TCU, the senior will get to work with noted quarterback developer Sonny Dykes, along with intriguing new offensive coordinator Gordon Sammis. The latter helped coach Joe Fagnano to one of the best seasons in college football at UConn. \n        \n            \n                Meet Josh Hoover, the TCU transfer who will follow Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza as Indiana QB\n                \n                    Shehan Jeyarajah                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Jackson Arnold, UNLV2025: 1,309 yards passing, 6 touchdowns, 2 interceptions, 311 yards rushing, 8 touchdowns at AuburnArnold made a bad call last year by hitching his wagon to doomed Auburn coach Hugh Freeze. When things went wrong, Freeze quickly threw Arnold under the bus. Luckily, Arnold chose much better for his third school, landing with Dan Mullen at UNLV. To start, Arnold boasts the physical tools to create major advantages in the Mountain West. Additionally, Mullen has done a tremendous job of maximizing quarterback talent, even ones who are still developing as passers. Expect Arnold to quickly contend for all-conference honors. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Alonza Barnett III, UCF2025 stats: 2,806 yards, 23 touchdowns, 8 interceptions, 589 yards rushing, 15 touchdowns at James MadisonBarnett led James Madison on an unlikely run to the College Football Playoff after an impressive junior campaign. In the first round against No. 5 Oregon, he played well, finishing with 273 yards passing, 45 yards rushing and three total touchdowns. Now, he'll get the chance to reorient Scott Frost's offense at UCF. His dual-threat upside gives Frost options. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Dylan Raiola, Oregon2025 stats: 2,000 yards, 18 touchdowns, 6 interceptions, 72.4% completion at Nebraska\nRaiola is an unusual addition to this list for one reason: He probably won't even play next year. The Nebraska transfer committed to the Ducks despite knowing incumbent Dante Moore could return for another year of eligibility. However, a chance to wait is actually the perfect situation for Raiola, who has been battered during his career with the Cornhuskers. Oregon gained an elite quality backup, and Raiola reset his development clock. Win-win. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Inter are still the best team in the Italian Serie A and also showed it on Saturday when the team coached by Cristian Chivu won 3-2 at San Siro against Juventus. Despite a controversial decision from the referee at the end of the first half, when Juventus defender Pierre Kalulu was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for a foul on Alessandro Bastoni, Inter finally managed to win against one of the top Serie A teams. The Nerazzurri have so far struggled to rise to the occasion against Europe's elite, both domestically and on the international stage. In Serie A, they suffered defeats to AC Milan and Napoli, while in the UEFA Champions League league phase, they were beaten by Liverpool, Atletico Madrid and Arsenal. As a result of those setbacks, Inter are now forced into the playoff round, where they will face Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday (3 p.m. ET on Paramount+) for the first leg, looking to advance to the round of 16. Inter played two Champions League finals in the last three years and even if their primary target is to win the Scudetto again, they can potentially have success in their European campaign thanks to their recent form, winners of six in a row.How to watch Bodo/Glimt vs. Inter, odds Date: Wednesday, Feb. 18 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Aspmyra Stadion -- BodoLive stream: Paramount+Odds: Bodo/Glimt +360; Draw +310; Inter -138Here's what to know about the win over Juve and what's to come against Bodo/Glimt: \nA controversial decision The controversial decision took place at the end of the first half in Milan when the referee Federico La Penna decided to send off Kalulu for a second yellow card for a foul on Bastoni. However, after reviewing the footage, it became clear that the contact on the Inter defender's shoulder was far less significant than it initially appeared. Despite that, VAR was unable to intervene. Under the current regulations in place until the end of the season, the video review can only overturn on-field decisions in cases involving red cards. Juventus were forced to play the remaining part of the game with 10 men, leading to their defeat at San Siro.\nThe post-match became heated as Juventus directors Giorgio Chiellini and Damien Comolli tried to confront the referee at the end of the first half in the tunnel alongside Juventus manager Luciano Spalletti. The Italian coach didn't speak after the match but left the floor to Chiellini, who seemed particularly frustrated.\"After what happened today, it's difficult to talk about football. Once again, something unacceptable occurred; you can't ruin a match of this level. This is a spectacle we present to the world; things need to change immediately, without the usual procrastination that often happens in Italian football. Since the beginning of the year, we have pointed out that there isn't a structure suitable for a league of this standard. We can't keep going like this. Decisions like the one made tonight simply cannot be taken so lightly.\"\nThe Italian chief of referees Gianluca Rocchi spoke on the matter to ANSA and said, \"La Penna is devastated and we stand by him, but I have to tell you the truth: he isn't the only one who made a mistake. Because yesterday there was a clear dive. The latest in a long series, in a league where they try in every possible way to deceive us.\"\nBastoni apologies During the pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Bodo/Glimt, Bastoni reflected on the last days, saying \"I wanted to be here because there's been so much talk about what happened on Saturday. I waited a few days to review what happened and understand the differences compared to what I felt on the pitch. I felt a contact with my arm, which, reviewing the footage, was absolutely accentuated. That's why I'm here, to admit it and take responsibility. But what I'm most disappointed about is the behavior following the sending off, so I'm here because a human being has the right to make mistakes, but also the duty to acknowledge them.\"Inter's depth will be key to UCL runDespite the episode mentioned above, Inter showed their full potential on Saturday, also thanks to the decisions made by Chivu in the second half. Unlike the past years when the second lines were not performing as the starting players, this season things are going much better. Francesco Pio Esposito, one of the most interesting Italian talents, scored a key goal against Juventus in the second half, while Piotr Zielinski scored the last-minute winning goal. Last season, the Polish midfielder didn't play regularly under Simone Inzaghi's management, but this season, also thanks to the recurring injuries of Hakan Calhanoglu, he played much more and has already scored six goals in all competitions, three in the last four Serie A games. While the second lines are more involved in the rotations and are performing better, Inter struggled more when they faced the top teams, and this is why the win against Juventus can become a turning point of the season ahead of the crucial last stretch. Inter faced a major setback in the closing months of last season, finishing without a single trophy and suffering a heavy 5–0 defeat to PSG in the Champions League final in Munich. It was a bitter ending that left a mark on the squad and its ambitions ahead of the current season, which also led to the departure of Inzaghi and the appointment of Chivu. \nThis season, however, the narrative could be very different. Lifting the Serie A trophy would not only make them forget last season's disappointment but also reaffirm Inter's status at the top of Italian soccer, while look to once again also conquer Europe.Possible lineupsBodo/Glimt XI: Nikita Haikin; Fredrik Sjoevold, Odin Luraas Bjoertuft, Jostein Gundersen, Fredrik Andre Bjoerkan; Haakon Evjen, Patrick Berg, Sondre Brunstad Fet; Ole Blomberg, Kasper Waarts Hoegh, Jens Petter Hauge.Inter XI: Yann Sommer; Manuel Akanji, Francesco Acerbi, Yann Aurel Bisseck; Luis Henrique, Petar Sucic, Piotr Zielinski, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Federico Dimarco; Marcus Thuram, Ange-Yoan Bonny.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This week in our college basketball futures article, I'll take a look at the national semifinal market. While a lot of people focus on who will win the championship, sometimes wagering on a team to reach the national semifinal round is the smarter bet. One thing I look for in betting college basketball futures is teams peaking late in the season. Those big matchups in November are fun to watch but the reality is they don't mean much come March. Here are a couple of teams I like in the national semifinal futures market and one to avoid. All odds are from FanDuel Sportsbook.Best bet: UConn Huskies (+340)Remember a couple of months ago when betting UConn to win it all was all the rage? After the Huskies fell to St. John's though, there hasn't been much talk about UConn with bettors now more enamored with other teams. One reason I believe the Huskies are flying a bit under the radar is because they play in the weak Big East conference. UConn had a killer non-conference schedule, so wins over BYU, Illinois, Kansas, Florida, and Texas got people excited. However, the Huskies have played just one big game since Christmas and that was a 81-72 loss to the Red Storm. I do believe playing in a weaker conference can hurt teams come NCAA Tournament time. That has been an issue for Gonzaga over the years. The difference is Danny Hurley has two titles and knows how to prepare his team in March. The key metric to predict a college basketball champion is finding teams that rank top 20 in both offensive and defensive efficiency on KenPom. UConn is right on the cusp, ranking 22nd in offensive efficiency and 10th in defensive efficiency as of Feb. 18. The Huskies also create a lot of turnovers and are a strong rebounding team. The only key metric I look at for the NCAA Tournament where UConn falls short is free throw shooting. The Huskies hit just 70% from the foul line, and that can be a factor in close games. I came into the season thinking UConn was one of the top teams in the country and my opinion hasn't changed. We are now at the buy point on the Huskies. There is good value backing UConn +340 to make the national semifinal and +1700 to win the title.Back UConn to make the national semifinal at DraftKings, where new users can get $200 in bonus bets when they wager $5 or more and that bet wins:Best value: Purdue Boilermakers (+600)Purdue is coming off a blowout loss to Michigan at home, so it may feel like a weird time to back them in the futures market. Betting futures is about being objective and looking for a number. Michigan is better than Purdue and the odds-on favorite to win the title. However, in a one-and-done format like the NCAA Tournament, Purdue may not have to play Michigan to reach the national semifinal and even after the loss, I still believe the Boilermakers can be dangerous in March. The thing I like about the Boilermakers is they are elite offensively and good enough defensively. Purdue ranks second in offensive efficiency and 27th in defensive efficiency. Compare that to a team like Alabama, who is also an elite offensive basketball team but ranks a distant 57th in defensive efficiency. The Tide's defense simply isn't good enough to win a title. Purdue is a veteran team that rebounds, shoots well from the perimeter and doesn't turn the ball over. Those are all qualities I look for in the NCAA Tournament. Another positive is the Boilermakers have played one of the toughest schedules in the country and been in a lot of close games. Stuff like that matters in March when a lot of games come down to the final few minutes. Purdue has stumbled at times stepping up in class with losses at home to Iowa State, Illinois and Michigan. Still, I believe the Boilermakers have the ingredients to win a few games in the NCAA Tournament and make a national semifinal run if they draw a favorable bracket.Bet on Purdue to be among the last four teams standing in the tournament at FanDuel, where new users can get $100 in bonus bets if their first wager of $5 or more wins:Team to avoid: Alabama Crimson Tide (+1300)The one championship futures bet I made before the season was Alabama at +4000. Both the Tide and Iowa State were sitting around that number and I was deciding which team to bet. I chose poorly. Alabama has a puncher's chance against anyone because of its offense. It's tough to play a team that routinely scores 90+ points. The Tide have scored at least 88 points a ridiculous 19 times this season. But I have to question a team that scores 100 points and only beats an average Texas A&M squad by three. It's hard to see a scenario where Alabama's defense holds up if the Tide face Duke, UConn or one of the better teams in the Big Ten and Big 12.The other thing that scares me about the Crimson Tide isn't they don't rebound well. Alabama is 0-10 in its last 10 games against Tennessee and Florida. Why? Because those two teams bully the Tide in the paint and dominate the offensive glass. Again, that doesn't bode well in potential matchups against strong rebounding teams like Michigan, Houston, Duke and UConn in the NCAA Tournament. Alabama is one of the most exciting teams in the country to watch and they have the talent to win a couple of games in the tournament. However, given the Tide's defensive liabilities, making the second weekend feels like the ceiling for them this season.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Michigan's stranglehold on the No. 1 overall seed tightened Tuesday night when the Wolverines toppled Purdue 91-80 on the road. A Wolverine loss could have made the discussion for the top spot in the bracket a lot more intriguing ahead of the NCAA Tournament selection committee's bracket preview on Saturday. But this cemented in stone that Michigan is the top dog. The Wolverines are now 10-0 in Quad 1, 19-1 across the first two quadrants, and rate as the No. 1 team across the board in metrics used by the selection committee.With a 10.55 WAB (Wins Above Bubble) score, Michigan has a commanding lead over second-place Duke (9.25) in that vital resume-based metric. At KenPom, the Wolverines possess a 39.33 Net Rating, which is even higher than the rating of last year's historically great Duke team.But of course, everything could change on Saturday. Just a few hours after the bracket preview, the No. 1 Wolverines and No. 3 Duke will square off on a neutral court in Washington, D.C. It's a huge spot for the Blue Devils, who will get a chance to halt the crowning of Michigan and show the country that it's a serious factor in the race to be the No. 1 overall seed.\nFor now, it's the Wolverines' world.

The Cornhuskers started 20-0, rose to No. 5 in the AP poll while slaying high-powered foes like Illinois and Michigan State and are well-positioned to win an NCAA Tournament game for the first time in program history. But as Selection Sunday creeps closer, the Cornhuskers are moving in the wrong direction within the CBS Sports Bracketology model. After Tuesday night's 57-52 loss at Iowa, Nebraska has dropped four of its past six games and is now a No. 4 seed.All hope for a rise back up the seeding list is not lost for Nebraska, which remains an impressive 11-4 across Quads 1 and 2. But none of its final five regular-season games are \"marquee\" matchups. In fact, the next two are landmine home games against Big Ten bottom feeders Penn State and Maryland that can do little to bolster the Cornhuskers' resume. Then comes a tricky west coast trip to USC and UCLA, both of whom are going to be fighting for their spots as at-large teams in the field of 68. On the upside, avoiding the Big Ten's best teams down the stretch could give the Cornhuskers a chance to rediscover the gear that carried them to a historic start that made this season such a memorable ride.\nRematch rulesAmid conference consolidation and the proliferation of nonconference matchups between high-major schools, the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee faces challenges when it comes to avoiding regular-season rematches. The 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket featured three potential second-round games between conference teams, although none of them came to fruition. The committee will still seek to minimize conference meetings and nonconference rematches, and our model is coded to do the same. However, NCAA bracketing principles permit games between conference teams in the second round, so long as the teams in question played each other just once before the NCAA Tournament. For conference teams that met twice prior to the NCAA Tournament, principles state they should not meet prior to the Sweet 16. If the teams played three times, NCAA bracketing principles state they should not play before the Elite Eight.With regard to rematches of nonconference games, NCAA bracketing principles state that they should be avoided \"in the First Four and first round.\" The committee will also \"attempt to avoid\" nonconference rematches in the second round. But the committee has historically prioritized keeping teams on their natural seed line over changing their seed line for the sake of avoiding a rematch. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 MLB regular season is fast approaching and teams around  the  league will use these next few weeks  to   evaluate their players  and  eventually finalize their Opening Day roster. Spring    training  games, which start Friday,  don't count, but they do matter. For many players, this  spring    training will be their best opportunity to win a big-league roster   spot. It    might be their only opportunity.                                          With    that in  mind, let's  break down 10 important position battles taking   place this spring, with an emphasis on teams aiming  to reach the  postseason. These are hardly the  only position battles this   spring --  lots of teams are sorting out their bench and auditioning guys for the  last spot in the bullpen -- but they're arguably the most important.            Baltimore Orioles: Leadoff hitterThere are a few others to consider, including Dylan Beavers and maybe even Adley Rutschman, though it seems likely the O's will start the season with one of those three players atop the lineup. Jackson Holliday was the club's primary leadoff hitter last year, though even before his recent hamate injury, I have to think Orioles wanted to do better than his .314 on-base percentage at leadoff. His place atop the lineup last year had more to do with getting a young player more at-bats during a lost season than putting the team in the best position to win.     Henderson was Baltimore's primary leadoff hitter in 2024. I'm new school in that I would put my best hitter in the leadoff spot to get him the most at-bats (think Shohei Ohtani), and batting Henderson leadoff would quality. Does rookie manager Craig Albernaz subscribe to that logic? We'll find out in spring training. Ward's power is better used in the middle of the order but he has led off at times in his career. Westburg is nursing an oblique injury and isn't a great leadoff option given his middling on-base percentages. If Albernaz wants to spread out his righty hitters though, putting him in the No. 1 spot is a possibility.            \nThe frontrunner: I'm going to say Henderson right now but this \"position\" battle is pretty wide open, and not necessarily one that will be determined in spring training. It is really, really easy to make lineup changes. If the offense isn't clicking early in the season, Albernaz can switch things up and move someone else to the leadoff spot.            Boston Red Sox: Second and third basesWe could even add Kristian Campbell and Ceddanne Rafaela to the mix, though it doesn't sound like Campbell is in the infield plans and Rafaela, who played 24 games at second base last year, looks set to stay in center field, where he won a Gold Glove last year. As things stand, Boston is sorting through several players for both second and third base. Durbin and Kiner-Falefa were brought in right before the start of spring training to add depth. (Kiner-Falefa seems more likely to be a utility guy.)     Complicating matters is Gonzalez's shoulder issue, which has limited him early in camp. He annihilates lefties and played his way into regular playing time last season. Gonzalez is a natural platoon partner for Mayer, who's had trouble some staying on the field throughout his career. Nate Eaton and Nick Sogard are the emergency options here. If the Red Sox open the season with one of those guys as a regular infielder, it means a) they got hammered with injuries, and b) they didn't do enough in the offseason.     \nThe frontrunners: It has to be Durbin and Mayer, right? How the Red Sox align them is another question (it has been Mayer at second and Durbin at third earlier in camp, though I'd argue the reverse is the best use of their defensive skills), but they're the young building block types. Kiner-Falefa is what he is, and that's a utility guy best used in moderation. Gonzalez is a must-start against lefties. His playing time against righties will be dictated by the health of his shoulder, his performance, and Durbin's and Mayer's performance as well.     Houston Astros: Right and left fieldsThis position battle extends into the infield, because the Astros have hinted at playing Jose Altuve in left field and Isaac Paredes at second base. Yordan Alvarez, however, seems locked in at DH. Don't expect to see him roaming left field much, if it all. For now, Jake Meyers in center field is about the only part of Houston's outfield that can be considered even remotely settled, and even that's not a given. The Astros could give Smith, who moved from third base to right field last year, time in center this spring.     Cole gave the Astros a nice boost late last season, though his strikeout issues are worrisome. Loperfido was reacquired from the Blue Jays last week and, frankly, isn't all that dissimilar from Cole. All things considered, Smith handled himself well last season considering he changed positions on the fly and played only 32 games in the minors after being drafted in the first round in 2024. Trammell and utility guy Zach Dezenzo didn't impress when they played last year. It's not the best outfield group for the Astros. This is a wide open spring competition. \nThe frontrunners: The answer is \"all of the above.\" Trammell's a long shot, otherwise Smith (a righty hitter) can platoon with Cole and Loperfido, two lefties. Paredes has been in trade rumors all winter. Trading him for a no-doubt starting outfielder would be ideal, though it seems unlikely at this point, especially after the Red Sox seemingly moved on and brought in Caleb Durbin and Isiah Kiner-Falefa. Still, keep an eye out for a Paredes trade, or another move that nets Houston a legitimate big-league outfielder.     Los Angeles Dodgers: No. 6 starterYes, that is No. 6 starter. The Dodgers use a full-time six-man rotation because Shohei Ohtani needs one to manage his workload. Blake Snell's Opening Day availability is in question because he slow-played his offseason routine after being heavily used last postseason -- \"You want to ramp up, but I gotta take my time and get healthy,\" he recently told the California Post -- which leaves an open rotation spot behind Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, Roki Sasaki, Emmet Sheehan, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto.           Three of those four pitchers above are coming off surgery. Wrobleski, who became a trusted bullpen option in October, is the only one who was healthy in 2025. Hurt returned from Tommy John surgery last September. Ryan missed last season with Tommy John surgery, though he completed his rehab and was considered for a postseason roster spot. Stone missed last season with shoulder surgery but is ready to go this spring. Landon Knack was one of 14 pitchers to make multiple starts for the Dodgers last year. He's still around as a deeper depth option.           \nThe frontrunner: I will say Wrobleski because a) he was pretty good last year and seems to have the trust of manager Dave Roberts, and b) he's the only one of the four candidates not coming back from major surgery. Ryan is the guy to watch this spring. He's done rehabbing and the Dodgers did seriously consider him for their postseason roster. It's high-end stuff, and if he's healthy, Ryan could pitch his way into the Opening Day rotation while Snell takes his time building up.           Milwaukee Brewers: Third baseThe Caleb Durbin trade left a pretty large hole at third base. Shortstop Jesús Made is one of the best prospects in baseball and he reached Double-A as an 18 year old last season. As much fun as it would be, I have a hard time seeing the Brewers jumping Made over Triple-A (after only five games at Double-A) and putting him at shortstop this season, and bumping Joey Ortiz back over to third. Made is a long-term solution. In the short term, the Brewers figure to have a stopgap at the hot corner.     Williams was the prize of the Freddy Peralta trade and he's going to spend this spring focusing on shortstop. It is far, far more likely Williams makes the Opening Day roster than Made, but even that is far from a given. Rengifo signed with the Brewers last week and has played every position except first base and catcher in his career. He is a much better everyday option than Hamilton, who fits best as a speedy part-time player. Wilken has yet to play above Double-A and has some strikeout issues to work through. Utility man Eddys Leonard is a long-shot third base candidate. \nThe frontrunner: I'll say Rengifo for now but I think Williams, who played six weeks in Triple-A last year and had a strong season overall, has a real chance to win the shortstop job this spring, which would push Ortiz to third and turn Rengifo (and Hamilton) into frequently used utility guys. Long-term, Made and Williams will be on the left side of the infield. Short-term, Rengifo makes the most sense as the stopgap.     New York Mets: Right fieldBrandon Nimmo, the club's longest-tenured player, was sent to the Rangers for Marcus Semien a few weeks back. The trade makes the Mets much better defensively on the infield but also leaves a pretty sizable hole in the outfield. They made a short-term/high-dollar offer to Kyle Tucker that ultimately wasn't enough, and they never really seemed to make a serious pursuit of Cody Bellinger. The Luis Robert Jr. pickup solves center field and Juan Soto is shifting back to left. Right field is a position without a player.            Give the Mets a truth serum and I'm certain they would tell you they want Benge, their top position player prospect, to win the job convincingly in spring training. Benge had a not great cameo in Triple-A at the end of last season though, and he's played only 56 career games above Single-A. Winning the job is not a certainty. Baty played a handful of games in the outfield in the minors and has nowhere to play on the infield after the Semien trade and Bo Bichette signing. Taylor is a true fourth outfielder who gets exposed with too much playing time. Journeymen Mike Tauchman and Jared Young are other candidates for right field.     \nThe frontrunner: It's Benge. I don't think it's a secret the Mets want him to be the guy. That said, it is not a lock, and Benge will have to perform well this spring to get an Opening Day roster spot. Baty and Tauchman are the logical backup plans. Taylor and Young, and to a lesser extent Melendez, are worst case scenario outcomes. Something will have gone very wrong if one of those guys get regular playing time in the outfield.            Philadelphia Phillies: Center fieldThe Phillies came into the offseason intending to reshape their lineup and it didn't really happen, did it? Nick Castellanos is out in right field and Adolis García, who is Nick Castellanos with better defense, is in. The infield is unchanged and J.T. Realmuto is back behind the plate. Center field stands as the single biggest position change, where Crawford is poised to unseat Rojas. Crawford slashed .334/.411/.452 in a full season at Triple-A last year and is one of Philadelphia's best prospects.         Rojas is an outstanding defender, but his chronically low on-base percentages make it hard for a contending team to carry him even as their glove-first No. 9 hitter. Brandon Marsh led the Phillies with 72 starts in center field last season, so I have to mention him here. He's clearly not in the center field plans though. Marsh is penciled into left field with Otto Kemp as his platoon partner. The top depth option behind Crawford and Rojas is former Astros' prospect Pedro León, who hasn't played much center field lately.           \nThe frontrunner: It's Crawford, for sure. Unless he has a disastrous spring training (I'm talking something like a .300 OPS while looking completely overmatched at the plate), he'll be the guy on Opening Day. Rojas is the backup plan in case Crawford, the son of the longtime big leaguer Carl Crawford, gets hurt in March. I almost didn't include the Phillies here because their center field position battle doesn't seem like much of a battle. They've have made it plainly obvious they want Crawford in center in 2026.           San Diego Padres: No. 4 and 5 startersThere are a few veterans to consider here too, including Walker Buehler, Griffin Canning, Marco Gonzales, Germán Márquez, and Triston McKenzie. Point is, those last two spots in the San Diego rotation are up for grabs. Michael King, Joe Musgrove, and Nick Pivetta will occupy the top three spots in whatever order, then it's an open competition for the last two spots. Sears came over from the Athletics as part of the Mason Miller trade and has the most big league experience. Vásquez made 26 starts (and two relief appearances) in 2025.     Waldron ramped up his knuckleball usage to 55% in Triple-A last season, but also had a 6.67 ERA in 18 starts at the level. He made 26 starts and threw 146 ⅔ innings for the Padres in 2024, then was pretty much out of the picture in 2025. Hart was unable to turn his tremendous 2024 season in Korea into consistent success with San Diego in 2025. He made as many appearances in Triple-A as he did in the big leagues (20 each). Hart re-signed with the club this offseason and the rotation offers for opportunity now.     \nThe frontrunners: I have to say Sears and Vásquez, at least until Canning completes his Achilles surgery rehab. Vásquez because he was pretty good last year (3.84 ERA in 133 ⅔ innings) despite worrisome under-the-hood numbers (4.85 FIP and 5.37 xERA); Sears because he never misses a start and the Padres could use a reliable innings guy at the back of the rotation with Musgrove coming back from Tommy John surgery. This is a position battle that will extend into the season. If it's Sears and Vásquez on Opening Day, OK, but if they don't perform, there are others waiting to take their place.Tampa Bay Rays: CloserPerhaps it's generous to consider the Rays a contender given the division they play in and the fact they won 80 games in 2024 and 77 games in 2025, but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, the Rays declined their $11 million club option for Pete Fairbanks early in the offseason and are now without a clear-cut closer for the first time in several years. Manager Kevin Cash is certainly savvy enough to use a closer by committee, though he's a shown a preference for a set closer when one is available.           Cleavinger is Cash's go-to left-on-left reliever and figures to remain in that role, which takes closing off the table. He needs to be available for important matchup situations in the seventh and eight innings. Jax, last summer's big trade deadline addition, and Uceta both have closer-caliber stuff and have filled in as ninth inning guys at times. Money may be a factor in this decision. Saves pay in arbitration and Jax is closer to free agency, meaning closer to being traded away by a Rays team that ships out its highest-salaried players every offseason. Using Jax as the saves guy would keep Uceta's arbitration salaries down. It's nasty business, but unfortunately these things happen all the time league-wide.           \nThe frontrunner: I think it'll be a closer by committee to begin the season. The Rays will determine their preferred matchups (we want this reliever facing this pocket of the lineup, etc.) and Cash will use his late-inning relievers accordingly. Effectiveness and/or injury as much as anything will decide whether Cash and the Rays have a set closer at some point in 2026. Given the way these things go, there's a chance it's someone who's barely on the radar (Hunter Bigge? Kevin Kelly?).           Texas Rangers: Center fieldThe center field position battle in Texas isn't so much a \"battle\" as it is just a thing they have to figure out. Carter, Haggerty, Helman, and Langford are all expected to be on the Opening Day roster, Carter and Langford as everyday players and Haggerty and Helman as platoon/bench guys. New addition Brandon Nimmo is shifting over to right field. So, who do the Rangers want in left and who do the Rangers want in center? Langford was a Gold Glove finalist in left field last year, but he has center field skills.            Multiple injuries (back, quad, wrist) have limited Carter, who was a revelation during the 2023 postseason, to only 108 games the last two years. Keeping him healthy is of paramount importance and putting him in left may be the best way to do it. Center field requires a lot of running. It's not just more ground to cover; it's having to back up right/left constantly as well. Haggerty and Helman both started 10-plus game in center last year, which says more about the position player plight of the 2025 Rangers than it does their viability as regulars. Alejandro Osuna and maybe even Ezequiel Duran are the deeper depth options in center.            The frontrunner: My hunch is the Rangers will keep Langford in left and go with Carter in center, and use Helman as the primary backup over Haggerty. Another Carter injury could send the Rangers scrambling. That could push super utility man Josh Smith off second base and into the outfield, or mean regular playing time for Osuna.            \n            ",

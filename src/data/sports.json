Miller Moss, who spent his last four seasons at USC and threw for 2,555 yards for the Trojans last year, has made the Cardinals one of the most consistent offenses in the nation by breaking 20 points in all nine games. He's thrown for 2,132 yards with 11 touchdowns this season. Star Louisville running back Isaac Brown will miss his second straight game, which means the Cardinals will likely rely on Miller even more on Friday. Meanwhile, Clemson quarterback Cade Klubnik has thrown for 2,136 yards with 14 touchdowns compared to five interceptions this season, and he's two weeks removed from throwing for 385 yards in a 45-point effort for the Tigers against Duke. The model projects the Over to hit in 54% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Spurs to defeat the Warriors (-142)\"Am I a huge Steph Curry fan? Not really,\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"In many ways, he has ruined the NBA with his crazy pull-up/step-back 3-pointers because he is so gosh-darn amazing that everyone thinks they can do it. Do I think schematically Curry was good for basketball? Absolutely not. But I would argue he has changed the NBA, maybe more than Jordan has. My point is that Steph can win a game by himself. He did Wednesday on the Riverwalk with 46 points. It's just so hard to sweep one of these baseball-type series, though -- especially away. Remember, we were in this spot last Sunday with Orlando. With trepidation, I played the Magic to sweep Boston in a similar home/home type thing. They didn't.\" Back San Antonio at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Iowa (-15.5) vs. Xavier (-112)\"On the wrong end of an 86-67 scoreline vs Santa Clara on Monday actually flatters the Musketeers, who only picked up the pace in garbage time when Richard Pitino let transfer guard Roddie Anderson (ex-UCSD and Boise State) shoot to his heart's content in the second half, when he scored 25 of his 29 points,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"A more accurate barometer of the X came in the first two games when laboring past LeMoyne and Marist, and the first half vs. SCU when held to 20 points. Good things are expected at Iowa under new head coach Ben McCollum, who made Drake the rage of the Missouri Valley last season and has the Hawkeyes shooting out the lights (57% from the floor!) in the first two games.

Thomas, who has already been discharged from the hospital, posted a video while standing up, indicating he was recovering well from the procedure. Thomas did not set a timetable for his return to the golf course but noted he will miss the start of the 2026 PGA Tour season at a minimum.\"My next few weeks will be a lot of resting before the rehab process begins,\" Thomas wrote. \"I have a great team behind me who I fully trust to get me back to a better place than I was before! Before you ask, I'm not putting any tournament on the calendar or specific time for returning. While I will miss some events in the beginning of 2026, I want to be very smart and patient in letting my disc fully heal so it isn't an issue again. I'm very lucky that the game of golf allows us to play at a high level for a long time, and that's what I plan on doing - this procedure will allow me to do that injury free in the future. Can't wait to see y'all back out there.\"\nThe 2026 PGA Tour season will start later than usual after The Sentry was cancelled due to drought conditions in Hawaii. Thomas won't set a target date, noting he will be patient and allow the disc to fully heal in hopes of avoiding any lingering issues. \nAlong with missing PGA Tour events, Thomas will no longer participate in the upcoming Skins Game competition on Black Friday. He was scheduled to compete with Keegan Bradley, Tommy Fleetwood and Xander Schauffele at his Panther National golf course in Florida. A replacement for Thomas was not immediately announced Friday. Thomas will also sit out the start of the TGL season. The second year of the simulator golf league begins Dec. 28, and if Thomas is going to miss tournaments in the 2026 season, he will assuredly be out for at least a portion of the TGL season for the Atlanta Drive. \nThe 2025 campaign was a return to form for Thomas, who picked up his first win since 2022 at the RBC Heritage and added three runner-up finishes among his eight top 10s. That showing earned Thomas a spot on the United States Ryder Cup team and pushed him back into the conversation among golf's best. Thomas' performance tapered off later in the year with just one top 10 in his last six events, and it has now become clear some of that was due to hip pain caused by a disc issue. \n            \n    ",

Although he lost his first two fights, he has not tasted defeat since. In September 2021, he earned a unanimous decision win over Ange Loosa in Dana White's Contender Series 39. He then joined UFC, and defeated Pete Rodriguez by TKO in his debut at UFC 270 in January 2022. In 20 professional fights, Della Maddalena is 18-2 with 12 wins by knockout, two by submission and four by decision.He is a highly decorated fighter, earning ESPN's 2022 UFC Men's Rookie of the Year and 2022 Co-Newcomer of the Year with Jailton Almeida by Cageside Press. He was UFC.com's 2022 Newcomer of the Year. He is a four-time Performance of the Night winner, and has won two Fight of the Night honors. He is No. 8 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings. Check out SportsLine to see his picks and analysis.Makhachev, 34, turned professional in August 2010, and won his first 12 bouts, including his UFC debut in May 2015. At UFC 187, he defeated Leo Kuntz by submission. After being knocked out by Adriano Martins later that year, he has gone on a tear. In 28 career fights, he is 27-1 with five wins by knockout, 13 by submission and nine by decision.He is a former UFC lightweight champion, where he successfully defended his title four times before deciding on moving up in weight class.

Mariscal uses his pace, pressure and grittiness to intimidate his opponents and wear on them. His volume-striking attack makes him dangerous, but it's his ability to grapple and scramble that give him the edge in this matchup. Sabatini is a Ju-Jitsu ace, with 13 of his 19 pro wins coming by submission. He is a savvy grappler who can keep his opponents pinned to the mat. However, I have a hard time seeing him do that to Mariscal, who has never been submitted in his 18-6 pro career. Mariscal has a 73% takedown defense rate and has shown the ability to get up when taken down. If this fight plays out on the feet, Mariscal's relentlessness will overwhelm Sabatini.\" See who else to back here. You can make this pick at FanDuel, where new users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev picksVithlani has strong picks for Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev and other bouts on the UFC 322: Della Maddalena vs. Makhachev card.

The move came less than a year after Harrison orchestrated one of the most controversial trades in NBA history, which saw Luka Dončić go to the Los Angeles Lakers and Anthony Davis return to Dallas as part of the deal.Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki commented publicly for the first time since Harrison was fired on Friday, stating that this move \"should've happened this summer.\"\"Too many distractions, too much going on to keep going this way,\" Nowitzki said on the Prime pregame show. \"This move probably should've happened this summer, honestly. I didn't want this negative energy and this black cloud over the Cooper Flagg era. ... This trade just made no sense. It made no sense to them, and really, there was no explanation for it either.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont let Nico Harrison trade Luka Dončić. Firing the GM doesn't change that\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNowitzki, one of the most celebrated players in Dallas' franchise history, played his entire NBA career (1998-2019) with the organization. He even played with Dončić for one season during the 2018-19 campaign before his retirement.\"It was very sad,\" Nowitzki said. \"Very sad how that ended. The fans feel like they got robbed of actually seeing the end, seeing this through. Seeing Luka develop into a champion one day. Felt like they never got to see the end to this, very heartbreaking. But now I think it's time to move on.\"\nDallas is off to a 3-9 start to the season and has lost six of its last seven games. Harrison, who was hired by the franchise in 2021, was fired the day after a 116-114 loss at home to the Milwaukee Bucks in which fans inside the arena chanted \"fire Nico\" throughout.\n            \n    ",

Dobbins for this Sunday's divisional matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs and possibly some time after due to a significant foot injury, according to the NFL Network. The report states that Dobbins is \"believed to be out for the foreseeable future\" and is exploring all options, including injured reserve. Dobbins suffered the injury in Week 10's win over the Raiders.If he is placed on IR, Dobbins would miss at least four games, meaning he'd be sidelined for matchups against the Washington Commanders, Las Vegas Raiders and Green Bay Packers if he is designated before the Week 11 game.So far this season, Dobbins has played in 10 games where he has totaled 772 rushing yards and four touchdowns.Injuries have plagued Dobbins' career, with the former second round pick missing 43 games over four years with the Baltimore Ravens and four games with the Los Angeles Chargers last season. If he misses more than one game, it will mark the fifth straight year he missed multiple games.\nDobbins' absence means a heavier workload for rookie RJ Harvey this week and potentially for the next few games. The rookie out of UCF has 214 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 50 carries so far this season while adding 175 receiving yards and four scores through the passing game.The running back room also includes Tyler Badie and Jaleel McLaughlin.\nThe 5-4 Chiefs and 8-2 Broncos will face off at Mile High at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and streaming on Paramount+. The Chiefs are favored in the matchup (-3.5), per DraftKings.\n            \n    ",

He should have the chance for another huge game in the rematch, and Warren will be in plenty of my DFS lineups for Week 11.He's a good price at $6,100 on DraftKings and $7,000 on FanDuel, and the Steelers have said they want to give him more work heading into this game against Cincinnati. It makes sense since the Bengals are No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing running backs, with 13 total touchdowns allowed.For the season, 11 running backs have scored at least 15.4 PPR points against Cincinnati, including Warren. He should have another big game against the Bengals again, and I'm excited for him to headline a lot of my DFS lineups in this scoring period.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 11, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        Bill Belichick is not worrying about anything but North Carolina's next opponent. The UNC coach knows there's an opening in the NFL that many will link him to, but his attention is on Wake Forest.Belichick's name has been tied to the New York Giants coaching vacancy since Brian Daboll was relieved of his duties following New York's Week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears.Belichick affirmed that commitment to Chapel Hill on Friday night when he said that he will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies.\"I have great respect and genuinely care for the New York Giants organization and both the Mara and Tisch families. The New York Giants played an important role in my life and in my coaching journey. It was a privilege for me to work for the Mara family and be a member of Coach Parcells' staff for over a decade. However, despite circulating rumors, I have not and will not pursue any NFL head coaching vacancies. \n\"Since arriving in Chapel Hill, my commitment to the UNC Football program has not wavered. We have tremendous support from the university, our alumni, and the entire Carolina community. My focus remains solely on continuing to improve this team, develop our players, and build a program that makes Tar Heel fans proud. We're on to Wake Forest.\"These comments came after Belichick struck a similar tone on Tuesday during his weekly press conference.\"I've been asked about it from time to time, but I've been down this road before,\" Belichick said. \"I'm focused on Wake Forest. That's it, and that's my commitment to this team, and next week, it'll be to our next opponent, and so forth. But, you know, I'm here to do the best I can for this team.\" \nIt's easy to see why so many have speculated about Belichick's possible interest in the Giants, and vice versa. Prior to winning six Super Bowls with the Patriots, Belichick won a pair of Super Bowls as the Giants' defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells. He was carried off the field by Giants players after New York shut out Washington in the 1986 NFC title game en route to defeating the Broncos in Super Bowl XXI.Four years later, Belichick's defense held the mighty 49ers' offense to just 13 points in what was one of the biggest upsets in conference title game history. A week later, his defense made even more history by holding the prolific Bills offense to just 19 points in the closest Super Bowl ever played. Belichick's controversial game plan worked; New York's defense (which often lined up with just two defensive linemen) allowed Thurman Thomas to rush for 135 yards, but it succeeded in neutralizing Jim Kelly and the Bills' prolific passing attack. That game plan currently resides in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. \nIn 2009, during a return trip to Giants Stadium, Belichick broke down in tears while reflecting back on his years with the Giants. Ironically, it was the Giants who handed Belichick's Patriots two of his three Super Bowl losses that includes New York's shocking upset over the previously-undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Belichick served as the Browns' head coach from 1991-95 and was the Patriots' coach from 2000-23. His six Super Bowl wins as a head coach is two more than the next closest coach, former Steelers coach Chuck Noll. Belichick's 303 regular season wins is the third highest total in NFL history. His 333 total wins is second to only Don Shula's 347 wins that came with the Dolphins and Colts. Belichick's NFL career will likely be immortalized in the Pro Football Hall in 2026. He is one of nine coaching semifinalists for induction next summer in Canton, Ohio. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Raheem Morris came under fire this week when comments from Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. were misinterpreted to make people think the young quarterback wasn't getting any support from the coaching staff. On Friday, Morris fired back at those online who pulled Penix's answer out of context.On Wednesday, Penix was asked about his mental and physical support systems. Penix cited his fiancé as the person he leans on mentally and emotionally, and he pointed to coaches back home for assisting him physically with tips on things like throwing mechanics.Some on social media clipped captioned video of the answer to make it seem as though Penix was implying he gets no help in Atlanta. In a charged response, Morris called the whole situation a \"joke\" and accused people of pulling things out of thin air.\"Stop looking for stuff on a young man,\" Morris said, per ESPN. \"You don't need this stuff on him. It is what it is. But all of those things people do, it doesn't matter to affect this building.\n\"I just feel bad for the kid. I don't want the kid having to deal with stuff that doesn't matter or stuff that's not real. ... Let his problems be his problems, like third downs. Let's fix those. Don't make up [a thing] that doesn't exist.\"In his full answer on Wednesday, Penix doesn't say anything that reflects poorly on the Falcons coaching staff. He was simply pointing to people outside the facility who lend support.\"Mentally, my fiancé is always there for me,\" Penix said. \"I know, whenever I get home, she's gonna be there for me. No matter how I played, she's always gonna be there for me. She's gonna have a smile on her face. She's gonna give me a hug and make me feel good no matter what.\n\"As far as physically, like on the field stuff, there's nobody I talk to as far as another quarterback or anything like that. I do have quarterback coaches from back home that reach out to me like, 'Hey, you need to clean this up or clean that up, and everything will be good.' Those guys help me as far as that too. Shoutout to them.\"The Falcons are currently riding a four-game losing streak, and that has put both Penix and Morris under a microscope. Penix, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, has completed 58.8% of his passes for 1,807 yards, nine touchdowns and three interceptions.Now 3-6 on the season, Atlanta occupies third place in the NFC South, and it desperately needs a divisional win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.\n            ",

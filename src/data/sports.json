    "body": "\n        No. 2 Michigan faces UCLA Saturday on CBS in a clash of Big Ten foes. This will be the 13th matchup between Michigan and UCLA since the turn of the century, with both programs having six wins against each other during that stretch.  The Wolverines (23-1) are off to their best 24-game start in school history, but are coming off an upset scare against Northwestern. Michigan trailed by as many as 16 points on the road before storming back in the second half to seal an 87-75 win over the Wildcats. Michigan's lone loss came against Wisconsin last month at home.  UCLA has won five of its last six games after starting 4-3 in Big Ten play. The Bruins are coming off a 77-73 win over Washington after guard Trent Perry dropped 23 points. UCLA heads into the weekend 3.5 games back of Michigan in the Big Ten standings.   The Wolverines hold a 2.0-game lead over Illinois for first place.    Michigan vs. UCLA: Need to know  Michigan could make race for No. 1 interesting: Michigan is the projected No. 1 overall seed in CBS Sports' latest Bracketology projections. The Wolverines jumped to No. 1 overall after Arizona lost to Kansas earlier this week. With Arizona dropping its first game of the season, the AP Top 25 poll on Monday should be interesting. Arizona has been the consensus top-ranked team for several weeks. It wouldn't be surprising to see Michigan get some consideration for No. 1.  \nCan UCLA get Donovan Dent going? The key to a potential upset for UCLA will be Dent. The former New Mexico star has had an up-and-down season with the Bruins after transferring in last offseason. Dent is having one of his best stretches at UCLA after recording at least 10 assists in three consecutive games. He played all 40 minutes against Washington and finished with 17 points, 10 assists and six rebounds.  Aday Mara faces his old team: A storyline to monitor will be Mara, who played the first two seasons of his career at UCLA, facing his old team. Mara played limited minutes under coach Mick Cronin at UCLA but has found a consistent role with the Wolverines. Michigan coach Dusty May has routinely deployed two-big lineups in his rotation. With Mara assuming a more prominent role, he has become one of the nation's best defensive players.    Where to watch Michigan vs. UCLA live  Date: Saturday, Feb. 14 | Time: 12:45 p.m. ET  Location: Crisler Center -- Ann Arbor, Michigan   \tTV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App  Streaming on Paramount+ Premium      Michigan vs. UCLA prediction, pick  \nFor the first 30 minutes of game time against Northwestern, Michigan looked vulnerable. Then, the Wolverines flipped the switch and looked like the team ranked No. 2 in the country. This game will be a tougher challenge for Michigan than its last matchup against Northwestern. Still, I expect Mara to have a big game against his old team and star forward Yaxel Lendeborg to have a bounce-back performance on offense after scoring just 35 points total in his last three games. Pick: Michigan -15.5\n \t \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Gary Parrish\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Matt Norlander\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Kyle Boone\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Isaac Trotter\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Cameron Salerno\n                            \n            UM -15.5\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            UCLA\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    STRAIGHT-UP\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Michigan\n                    \n    \n    Who will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson hopes to parlay his upcoming fight into a shot in the sport's top promotion.Steveson (2-0) fights 11-year veteran Hugo Lezama (11-3) on Feb. 19 in Mexico. Steveson says he's in touch with the UFC and believes a big knockout could propel him to the next level. Ideally, the 2020 Olympic gold medalist in freestyle wrestling wants to debut at the UFC White House card set for June 14.\"We've been in a lot of contact [with the UFC],\" Steveson told ESPN.   \"Most definitely, I'll call [for the White House]. I think it's   rightfully so, especially if a big knockout happens next Thursday. It   would be my fourth one: three in MMA and one in boxing.\"  Steveson is currently training with former two-division UFC champion Jon Jones, whom many deem the all-time best. Jones once predicted that Steveson would be a UFC heavyweight champion by early 2027. Steveson, who isn't even signed by the promotion, agrees that he'll be champion roughly this time next year.\n\"Yeah, I  believe it,\" Steveson said. \"I've got full  confidence in myself. With a guy like Jon, I feel like my confidence  goes through the roof, and the best thing about it is that he sees me  firsthand, training with him and hitting the pads, going through all the  motions. \"His word is gold with that. If it's not next year, it'll be  soon after that. It just depends on how the cards fall.\"\nSteveson won two NCAA Division I national wrestling championships with the University of Minnesota. He embarked on an unsuccessful professional wrestling career with the WWE before signing with the Buffalo Bills in 2024. The Bills released Steveson three months after signing him. He subsequently started his MMA journey, which has thus far been a success.\n            \n    ",

The fight will take place at the Co-Op Live in Manchester, England, Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions announced Friday.Wardley (20-0-1, 19 KO) scored the biggest win of his career this past October, stopping Joseph Parker in the 11th round of their clash for the WBO interim title. After undisputed champion Oleksandr Usyk chose to relinquish his WBO title, Wardley was promoted to full champion.The win over Parker was Wardley's second consecutive late stoppage win in a fight he was losing on the scorecards. Prior to the Parker win, Wardley was down big on the scorecards against Justis Huni, only to score a knockout in Round 10 to win the WBA interim title.Dubois has taken a hard road to become one of the top heavyweights in the world. After a 15-0 start to his career, Dubois suffered a 2020 knockout loss to Joe Joyce in a fight where he was ahead on two of three scorecards but suffered a broken left orbital bone and nerve damage around his eye.\nDubois bounced back with four stoppage wins before losing to Usyk in a bout for three world championships. Two fights later, Dubois won the IBF interim title with a stoppage of Filip Hrgovic and was promoted to full champion after Usyk vacated the title.After the biggest win of his career, a dominant fifth-round knockout of Anthony Joshua in a packed Wembley Stadium in London, Dubois was set to defend his belt against Parker in February 2025 only to be forced out of the bout due to illness. In his return to the ring, Dubois was again stopped by Usyk in a bout to crown an undisputed champion.\nDubois has not fought since the July 2025 loss to Usyk in the rematch, but gets another crack at a world title against a champion with big power, but who has needed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in back-to-back fights.\n            \n    ",

It's been a rousing success thus far. The Americans routed Italy, 6-0, in their quarterfinal matchup on Friday to advance to the medal round.The Americans only led 1-0 after the first period due in large part to the spectacular efforts of Italy goaltender Gabriella Durante. However, the U.S. eventually solved Durante and hung five goals in the second period to coast to a blowout victory in the knockout round.Defender Megan Keller got on the board first, but it was Kendall Coyne Schofield who got the ball rolling for Team USA. She had two goals in the first few minutes of the middle frame -- her first two goals of the tournament -- and those set the tone for the rest of the game.Caroline Harvey tacked on another assist, giving her eight points and the U.S. women's record for the most points in a single Olympics for a defender. Harvey's fellow Wisconsin defender, Laila Edwards, also shined with one goal and one assist.\nTeam USA has now outscored its opponents 26-1 in these Olympics, and it outshot the Italians 51-6 in this game. The Americans have faced little resistance so far, but perhaps that will change in the semifinal game on Monday. That matchup is yet to be determined as the teams get re-seeded after the quarterfinals.Below is everything you need to know about how to watch Team USA's quarterfinal clash with Italy, as well as how they got here.\nU.S. women's hockey Olympic scheduleAll times EasternPreliminary roundThursday, Feb. 5: USA 5, Czechia 1 Saturday, Feb. 7: USA 5, Finland 0Monday, Feb. 9: USA 5, Switzerland 0Tuesday, Feb. 10: USA 5, Canada 0QuarterfinalFriday, Feb. 13: USA 6, Italy 0SemifinalTBD vs. TBD | Monday, Feb. 16 | 10:40 a.m. | TBDBronze medal game\nTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 8:40 a.m. | TBDGold medal gameTBD vs. TBD | Thursday, Feb. 19 | 1:10 p.m. | TBD\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am leaderboard is littered with the biggest names in golf, but after two rounds it's Akshay Bhatia who holds a share of the lead heading into the weekend. Bhatia has gone bogey-free around Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill over the first two days of play, following up a 65 at Pebble Beach on Thursday with an 8-under 64 at Spyglass Hill on Friday. Bhatia's iron play has led the way, as is often the case for those that succeed on the small greens at Pebble Beach. He's third in strokes gained on approach through the first two rounds. The young lefty's game has been sharp tee-to-green, and even when he's had the occasional miss, he's a perfect 6-for-6 getting up-and-down. That's the recipe for success at this event, and as the professionals lose their amateur partners for the weekend and get to focus solely on playing Pebble Beach, Bhatia will look to continue his incredible ball-striking performance. The light winds and soft greens on the California coast have created ideal scoring conditions, so even with a bogey-free performance so far, Bhatia has company at the top in the form of Ryo Hisatsune. The young Japanese star is continuing his stellar form early in the season, and while he did cool off a bit on Friday after his first-round 62 put him in another early lead, he was able to put together a solid 67 to remain in a share of the lead.\nLeading the charge from the chase group is Rickie Fowler, who matched Bhatia's 64 at Spyglass to get to 14 under heading into the weekend. Fowler is now in position to contend for his first victory since 2023, and is looking to continue a solid start to 2026. Fowler hasn't traditionally thrived at Pebble Beach, but he's been the best player in the field this week with his irons, gaining 4.8 strokes on approach so far. The 37-year-old highlighted that he feels better physically this year than he did in 2025 when he battled a shoulder injury, but was able to secure a top-50 position and a spot in all of the Signature Events this year. \"My shoulder was bad all last year so I was just trying to manage and get through as best that I could. I definitely earned the time off with sneaking inside that top-50, so that was a nice bonus,\" Fowler said. \"So that was what I was trying to work towards to, like I said, earn that time off and then be able to get into a position where I could get the body in a better spot and go play this year.\" \nThat extended time off certainly seems to have paid off with a pair of top 20s to start the season and now a late tee time on the weekend at Pebble Beach. Fowler will need to keep up the strong iron play on Saturday and Sunday if he's going to contend for the win, but he's been lights out attacking soft greens thus far. The time to get the course was certainly the first two days, as the forecast calls for winds to pick up starting on Saturday afternoon and continue blowing 17-21 mph throughout Sunday's final round -- with some rain to add to the misery. For the leaders, that'll make it a challenge to hold up in rapidly changing conditions, but it will also make it harder for the chase pack to go low around them. The leadersT1. Akshay Bhatia, Ryo Hisatsune (-15)Bhatia had a rocky start to 2026 with a pair of missed cuts, but he found something in Phoenix last week with a T3 and has carried that form into Pebble Beach. A two-time winner on the PGA Tour, we've seen that when Bhatia gets hot, he can go on a tear. Given the scoring to start the week at Pebble Beach, that'll be a must, as he's going to need to keep the pedal down to pick up the biggest win of his young career. \nHisatsune meanwhile has been on a tear for the last three weeks, and he continues to build confidence in his ability to contend with the best. After a T2 at Torrey Pines and a T10 at TPC Scottsdale, he keeps putting himself in position and learning how to handle the nerves on the weekend. The putter has been leading the way this week, and he seems extremely comfortable on poa greens that can give some players fits. We'll see if that holds up on the weekend, but a late tee time should feel like part of the routine after his last two weeks. The challenge for both Bhatia and Hisatsune will be holding off the best field of the young season with the weather expected to shift dramatically over the course of the weekend. Other contendersT3. Rickie Fowler, Sam Burns (-14)T5. Min Woo Lee, Sepp Straka, Jacob Bridgeman (-12)T8. Tom Hoge, Jake Knapp (-11)T10. Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Fitzpatrick, Keegan Bradley, Jordan Spieth, Xander Schauffele and two others (-10)T17. Rory McIlroy, Chris Gotterup, Tommy Fleetwood and two others (-9)T34. Scottie Scheffler and 10 others (-6)\nBurns joined Fowler at 14 under, and in news that will come as a surprise to no one, it's a hot putter that has Burns in contention. Straka had a top 10 at Pebble last year and is in position to back that up again in 2026, joining Min Woo Lee in the top five. The group at T10 features some big names, but even in a sea of other major winners, Spieth is the player most are watching with interest this weekend. We haven't seen him anything close to his peak in some time, but any signs of life from the three-time major winner spark hope that he might be returning to top form. A bit further off the pace is Chris Gotterup, who finally cooled off a touch and is going to need a big Saturday effort if he's going to capture his third win of the young season. Defending champion Rory McIlroy is also at 9 under heading to the weekend, and will feel like he left a few shots out there on Friday that would've made him an even bigger threat to repeat. \nThen there's Scottie Scheffler, who is nine shots off the pace, but similar to last week in Phoenix, he bounced back from a rough Thursday to surge up the leaderboard with a Friday 66. He'll need to produce something magical to get in the mix late on Sunday, but after almost pulling off a huge come from behind victory a week ago, it's impossible to write him off. Updated 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am odds, picksAkshay Bhatia (+340)Rickie Fowler (11/2)Ryo Hisatsune (11/2)Sam Burns (6-1)Sepp Straka (14-1)Min Woo Lee (16-1)Jake Knapp (20-1)Rory McIlroy (22-1)Jacob Bridgeman (22-1)Xander Schauffele (25-1)If the winds pick up, this tournament could shift considerably, and it's going to be critical for players to get out to fast starts in their third round before it becomes a battle to hang on through difficult weather on Sunday. I tend to trust those leaning on ball-striking over putting when things get tough, which points me to Fowler and Straka of the guys just off the lead. I also don't hate sprinkling some of the pre-tournament favorites like McIlroy and Scheffler at longer odds, because there's certainly the potential for the top of the leaderboard to come back a bit in tougher conditions the elite players may handle a bit better. \n            ",

Among the allegations made by federal prosecutors is that Clase partook in an illegal gambling scheme during a 2024 playoff game.Clase and teammate Luis Ortiz have been on the restricted list for the Guardians since last July while under investigation. Ortiz has since asked for his case to be severed from Clase and has claimed that he was an unknowing victim in the scheme that was being headed up by Clase. Clase is alleged to have thrown balls on purpose (ball/strike prop bets were available at some sportsbooks) in a list of 15 different examples, ranging from 2023-25. One that stands out in the indictment is a pitch from the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 2024 ALDS against the Tigers. The Guardians won that game 7-0 and Clase retired all three batters he faced in the ninth inning, but the first pitch Clase threw was a ball to Tigers hitter Matt Vierling that bounced in front of the plate.Further, the allegations note that there were at least three other times when Clase intended to throw a ball on purpose but didn't get into the game. \nVia The Athletic: Robinson Vasquez Germosen was charged with five federal counts by prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York. They allege that he worked with Clase and, later, Ortiz to rig pitches during Guardians games so that they and others could win money betting on them. He is also accused of lying to federal agents during an interview as part of the investigation. Vasquez was arrested in December and released on $100,000 bond.The allegations note that Clase and Vazquez would use coded language to communicate on the pitch-fixing. Such as: \"Throw a rock at the first rooster in today's fight,\" from Vasquez and \"Yes, of course, that's an easy toss to that rooster,\" from Clase (The Athletic). \nClase's trial is set for May 4. Expect him to remain on the restricted list until the conclusion of the trial. A lifetime ban from baseball is a potential outcome if he's found guilty. \n            \n    ",

The showcase, designed to give the best young players in the league the chance to take center stage, will have more juice than normal because this year's rookie class has been one of the best in recent memory.However, the leading candidate for rookie of the year won't be playing. Mavericks star Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick in last summer's NBA Draft, will miss the Rising Stars Challenge due to a foot injury. Before suffering the injury, Flagg was on an offensive tear. He became the first teenager in NBA history to record back-to-back 30-point double-doubles last month. He also scored 49 points against the Hornets, which was the most by a teenager in NBA history.\n        \n            \n                NBA Rookie Rankings: Kon Knueppel stays on Cooper Flagg's heels in ROY race\n                \n                    Jasmyn Wimbish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDespite Flagg being out, there are plenty of others worth keeping an eye on. Flagg's college teammate at Duke, Kon Knueppel, has knocked down 183 3-pointers this season. He is on pace to shatter the rookie record held by Keegan Murray for the 3-pointers made. Murray knocked down 206 during the 2022-23 campaign.Flagg and Knueppel were selected No. 1 and 2 overall in the Rising Stars draft by Carmelo Anthony and Tracy McGrady, respectively. Anthony, McGrady, Vince Carter and Austin Rivers will be the four coaches for the event. Rivers will be coaching the best players from the G League.While there have been plenty of stars from the rookie class, there will also be some notable second-year players participating. One of them is San Antonio Spurs guard Stephon Castle, the reigning NBA Rookie of the Year. Castle will join forces with Dylan Harper and Reed Sheppard -- the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft -- on Team Melo.The headliner on Team Vince is 76ers guard VJ Edgecombe, the No. 3 overall pick from last summer's draft.

He claimed the NFL is \"rife with racism,\" specifically in its hiring and promotion of Black coaches.\"The court's decision recognizes that an arbitration forum in which the defendant's own chief executive gets to decide the case would strip employees of their rights under the law,\" said attorneys Douglas H. Wigdor and David E. Gottlieb in a statement. \"It is long overdue for the NFL to recognize this and finally provide a fair, neutral and transparent forum for these issues to be addressed.\"  \nAs a result of the ruling, the case will now move to trial, with a pretrial conference scheduled for Friday, April 3 in New York. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- For better or worse, tanking and the draft lottery are hot topics in the NBA as we enter All-Star Weekend. Less than 24 hours before the NBA Rising Stars Challenge, the Utah Jazz and the Indiana Pacers were fined by the NBA on Thursday night.The Jazz were hit with a $500,000 fine, while Indiana was fined $100,000 related to the management of their respective rosters in recent games. If you thought the tank last year for Cooper Flagg was worth monitoring, this year will be an even bigger story because of the blue-chip talent at the top. Duke's Cameron Boozer, BYU's AJ Dybantsa and Kansas' Darryn Peterson project as the top three picks in this summer's draft, and each of them can represent a foundational building block for the franchise.\n        \n            \n                2026 NBA Mock Draft: Where college stars like Cameron Boozer, Caleb Wilson figure to go\n                \n                    Adam Finkelstein                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever, this year's NBA rookie class, headlined by names like Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper, VJ Edgecombe and Kon Knueppel, makes it one of the strongest classes in years. The term \"Capture the Flagg\" took over social media in the months leading up to the lottery, which was won by the Dallas Mavericks. Dallas entered the draft lottery with just a 1.8% chance of landing the top pick.With the draft lottery and the race to the bottom of the standings being such a hot topic among NBA fans, some players admitted to keeping tabs on what was happening toward the bottom of the NBA standings before they were drafted. Others, when asked, said they blocked it out.\n\"I ain't going to lie, I did,\" Edgecombe said when asked if he followed the NBA standings. \"Early in the season, I wasn't really hooping. They had me in the honorable mention for Freshman of the Year and stuff like that. ... I did, not going to lie. I was looking.\"Coming out of Baylor, Edgecombe was a projected top-five pick, but it was unclear exactly where he would land on draft night. After the 76ers moved into the top three and passed on the chance to select Ace Bailey, who reportedly canceled his pre-draft workout with the 76ers, Philadelphia landed on Edgecombe.That's part of the reason why this topic has extended to the All-Star Game. A team like Jazz dropped all the way to pick No. 5 last year after finishing with the worst record in the league. Utah selected Bailey at No. 5. Utah owes its 2026 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder if it finishes outside of the top eight in this year's lottery.\n\"My head was just down, focusing on the main thing, being in the NBA,\" Bailey said on whether he paid attention to the standings. \"That was my main goal. Had my circle around me blocking out the outside noise.\"A player like Brooklyn's Egor Dёmin, who had a wide range of where he might get picked in the months leading up to the draft, also paid attention to what was going on in the NBA before he entered.\"I was really trying to stay present,\" Dёmin said. \"As big as the NBA is, standings and other stuff, it's just popping out. Even if you're trying not to see it, you're going to still see (the standings).\"\nSince the draft odds were flattened in 2019, the team that finished the season with the worst record in the association has never landed the No. 1 pick. In 2024, the Hawks had just a 3% chance of landing No. 1. That draft was more of a mystery than last year and 2026. There wasn't a clear-cut top prospect that teams were necessarily tanking for, which led to drama on draft night.The biggest college star leading up to the 2024 NBA Draft was Reed Sheppard, who was selected by the Houston Rockets at No. 3. Houston held the Brooklyn Nets pick and moved up from having the ninth-best odds at No. 1 to inside the top three on lottery night. The NBA standings and the tank race that year were \"hard to not ignore\" for Sheppard.\n\"It's definitely hard to not ignore,\" Sheppard said. \"I was trying to focus on the season and not trying to get caught up in everything. Social media, you're going to see things.

    "body": "\n        Opening Day and the start of a new Major League Baseball season is roughly six weeks off, but teams are already announcing plans for who'll take the ball for their maiden voyage in 2026. Traditional MLB Opening Day is set for Thursday, March 26 in the 2026 season, though the Yankees and Giants will get the season started a day earlier with a matchup in San Francisco on March 25.With that in mind, CBS Sports will use the space below to log every team's Opening Day starting pitcher decision. These things are always subject to change at a later date, be it because of injury or further roster move, but we'll keep this as current as the news cycle allows.Before we meet this year's crop of Opening Day starters, here's a look at the pitchers who've made the most of these starts in MLB history:Tom Seaver: 16Steve Carlton: 14Jack Morris: 14Randy Johnson: 14Walter Johnson: 14\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Boston Red Sox: Garrett CrochetCrochet will be entering his second season with the Red Sox, and he'll be making his third consecutive (and third overall) Opening Day start. Crochet finished second in American League Cy Young Award voting after compiling a 2.59 ERA (159 ERA+) and a 5.54 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 32 starts.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Detroit Tigers: Tarik SkubalSkubal, winner of two consecutive AL Cy Young awards, will make his third consecutive Opening Day start for the Tigers, tying him for eighth most in franchise history. It's possible this could be Skubal's final Opening Day assignment for Detroit. He's entering his walk year and is expected to receive a massive payday after accumulating a 3.08 ERA (135 ERA+) and a 5.17 strikeout-to-walk ratio over his first 137 big-league appearances.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston Astros: Hunter BrownThe Astros will start someone other than Framber Valdez (now a member of the Tigers) on Opening Day for the first time since 2021. Brown will receive the honors after managing a 2.43 ERA (172 ERA+) and a 3.61 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 31 starts in 2025. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Marlins: Sandy AlcantaraIt was Friday, Feb. 13 when the Marlins announced that Sandy Alcantara would again get the ball on Opening Day. This will be the sixth time in the last seven seasons that he opens the season for the Marlins with 2024 -- when he was recovering from Tommy John surgery -- being the exception. The 2022 Cy Young winner was 11-12 with a 5.36 ERA last season, but he seemed to finally pitch back to form late in the season. He was 5-1 with a 2.68 ERA in the last eight outings.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Newly minted FBS school North Dakota State found itself in a position similar to Alabama fans during the heyday of Nick Saban's dynasty: It simply won too much. The school has captured 10 national championships in 15 years. Within the fan base, the expectation is not just success, but success at the highest level.Attendance for early-round home playoff games that NDSU is expected to win handily has suffered. This year's loss to Illinois State drew an official attendance of 10,464 to the 19,000-seat Fargodome, roughly half full. Despite five interceptions from Redbirds quarterback Tommy Rittenhouse, the No. 1 Bison lost. It marked the first time NDSU had fallen before the quarterfinal round since 2009 and the first time a No. 1 seed lost its playoff opener since 2004.Few knew it at the time, but it was NDSU's final game at the FCS level. A process that began ramping up in late fall accelerated in January, when athletic director Matt Larsen began to believe the program was moving up from the division it had dominated since 2004. For a segment of the Bison fan base, the move to FBS will provide a new challenge.\"I do think there's an element of our fan base of what's next we've had great success, is there a next iteration at a higher level for Bison football?\" NDSU AD Matt Larsen told CBS Sports. \"And so I think that's where, if you would ask me, six or seven years ago, where the fan base was, they probably weren't there yet, right? But four national championships later, and I think the majority of Bison nation would tell you that this is the right next step, and it's the right time to do it.\"\nTo compete in the FBS, North Dakota State has to be up to par not only on the field, but also financially. NDSU will pay $5 million to the NCAA to transition and a $12.5 million entry fee to the Mountain West over six years.Consider the Fargodome. the longtime home to the Bison is owned by the city of Fargo and requires voter approval for renovations. A referendum has failed twice in recent years. Larsen said the Fargodome has a reserve fund earmarked for renovations, but the 32-year-old building needs updates, particularly for more premium seating. A pending convention center project -- which may or may not be located at the Fargodome site -- also factors into the decision-making.North Dakota State opened a 117,000-square-foot, $54 million football facility in 2022. Its total athletic department budget is about $30 million annually, and Sportico reported the school spent $8.4 million on football in the last fiscal year. Larsen expects that figure to double within two years, accounting for staffing, scholarships, revenue sharing and coaching compensation.\nThe school's primary athletics fundraising arm said it has \"tentatively raised\" $25 million for the move. NDSU does not expect to add sports to offset the increase in football scholarships from 65 to 85 upon moving to FBS.The school will receive a full share of Mountain West television revenue by 2032, but as CBS Sports previously reported, it will collect 50% of College Football Playoff and bowl revenue distributed to full members this year and 100% after its second postseason appearance. The school plans to challenge the NCAA's two-year probationary period that bars it from postseason play.As with many realignment cases, the loss of tradition is part of the cost. South Dakota State and North Dakota State have met 118 times and have played for the Dakota Marker trophy since 2004. The rivalry has often determined FCS supremacy, with one or both teams ranked in the top five when they meet. After the 2022 season, they faced each other in the national championship game.\n\"I would say for the foreseeable future, it's probably on hold,\" Larsen said. \"I think our rivalry was one out of really great respect between programs that did it the right way. And so I think there's so many positives to this move, I think the one thing you could say that our fans are going to miss it's playing for the Dakota Marker, because there were some epic games over the course of the last 10-15, years that have created great memories and great opportunities for our fans.\"As one FCS administrator cautioned to CBS Sports, there is a \"careful what you wish for\" element to moving up -- trading double-digit win seasons and championship runs for years that could end in a lower-tier bowl game in a far-flung locale that is difficult to reach. The novelty can be appealing at first, but it fades without winning.Still, there is reason for optimism about the Bison's ability to compete quickly. Programs with less FCS pedigree have made successful transitions in recent years.\nThe newest FCS-to-FBS members, Delaware and Missouri State, both finished 7-5 and reached bowl games in their debut seasons. After struggling in its 2024 debut, Kennesaw State went 10-2 under new coach Jerry Mack and won a conference championship over Jacksonville State, which moved up in 2023 and has won at least eight games in each of its first three FBS seasons under two different coaches. Sam Houston also moved up in 2023 and, in its second year, narrowly missed a Conference USA title while winning 10 games. James Madison transitioned in 2022 under Curt Cignetti and has won at least eight games every year since. The 2025 season under Bob Chesney culminated in a College Football Playoff berth.The relative ease of those transitions raises questions about the gap between the top half of the FCS and the Group of Five conferences.In many respects, North Dakota State accomplished all it could at the FCS level. Now, the FBS journey begins.\n            ",

    "body": "\nFor the first time since July 17, there will not be a NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL or college football game on Friday. That means all eyes should be on the game of the night: the No. 10 Michigan State Spartans taking on the Wisconsin Badgers at the Kohl Center in Madison, Wisc.The Spartans (20-4, 10-3 in Big Ten) are tied for third in the conference. They are coming off a much-needed 85-82 overtime win over No. 5 Illinois, which ended a two-game skid for Michigan State.The Badgers (17-7, 9-4) also are coming off an overtime victory over Illinois, a 92-90 decision in Champaign on Tuesday. Wisconsin is tied for sixth in the Big Ten. The Spartans are 2.5-point favorites over the Badgers.While Michigan State vs. Wisconsin is the marquee attraction on Friday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that includes a full college basketball schedule and the NBA's Rising Stars. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Friday, Feb. 13.

Even though they have two road wins (Michigan and Illinois) better than any other team's, Greg Gard's men aren't even among the 10 teams also \"receiving votes\" in the AP Top 25 poll. The Badgers feature a very good back-court in Nick Boyd (20.2 points per game) and John Blackwell (18,7) that would be the envy of many teams. Led by those two, Wisconsin averages 121.7 points per 100 possessions, according to KenPom, which ranks 28th in the country. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, says the Badgers have a 59.0% chance to cover and assigns a B grade to Wisconsin +2.5. Meanwhile, Patterson is expecting a lot of points. \"If the Badgers are a step faster on offense and Jeremy Fears can cut through the Wisconsin defense like Keaton Wagler did, there's a real bucket-for-bucket game script that could take us Over this total,\" he says.NBA best bets, where to watchRising StarsTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Expert: Team Melo +230 (Mike Barner)The NBA will showcase its best young talent on Friday when the Rising Stars competition takes place at the Intuit Dome. The mini-tournament will feature three teams of the league's rookies and sophomores and one team comprised by G-Leaguers. In the first semifinal, Team Austin will face Team Melo. Team Vince will take on Team T-Mac in the second semifinal, with the two winning teams squaring off in the final. Star rookie Cooper Flagg, who was originally set to play for Team Melo, will miss the game because of an ankle sprain, but Barner still likes the team to win the competition. \"(Ace) Bailey replaces Flagg, and he has been playing well heading into the break, averaging 15.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.6 three-pointers over his last 17 games,\" he says.Looking aheadCollege basketball: No. 9 Kansas at No. 5 Iowa StateTime: 1 p.m. Saturday | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Iowa State -6.5\nWill he play or won't he? That the question surrounding Kansas Jayhawks star and potential No. 1 overall pick Darryn Peterson every game now since he has been in and out of the lineup for much of the season, sometimes mysteriously, with various ailments (cramps, hamstring and flu, among other things). When he has played, he has been great (20.5 points per game in 13 starts). And when he hasn't played, the Jayhawks (19-5, 9-2 in Big 12) still have been very good, knocking off No. 1 Arizona on Monday. But on Saturday, Kansas goes on the road to face the fifth-ranked Iowa State Cyclones (21-3, 8-3), who rank sixth in the country in defensive efficiency (92.0 points per 100 possessions). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Cyclones have a 60.0% chance to cover and gives a B grade to Iowa State -6.5.No. 25 Kentucky at No. 14 FloridaTime: 3 p.m. Saturday | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kentucky +11.5\nThe lead in the SEC will be on the line when the Florida Gators and Kentucky Wildcats collide on Saturday at the O'Connell Center. The Gators (18-6, 9-2 in SEC) lead the conference by one game over the Wildcats (17-7, 8-3) and Arkansas Razorbacks (18-6, 8-3). Florida has emerged once again as the best team in the SEC. Over their last four games, the Gators have outscored opponents by an average score of 92-65. But on Saturday, they face a Kentucky team that is on its own roll, having won eight of its last nine. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 59.0% chance the Wildcats cover this large spread and assigns a C grade to Kentucky +11.5.No. 16 Texas Tech at No. 1 ArizonaTime: 6:30 p.m. Saturday | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Texas Tech +9.5\nThe top-ranked Arizona Wildcats will look to bounce back from their first loss of the season when they host the Texas Tech Red Raiders on Saturday at the McKale Center. On Monday the Wildcats (23-1, 10-1 in Big 12) failed to execute in the second half and lost at Kansas. Meanwhile the Red Raiders (18-6, 8-3) are coming off a 34-point victory against Colorado, which prompted Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle to rip into his team. While the Wildcats figure to have the advantage on the glass, Texas Tech leads the conference and ranks seventh in the nation in 3-point makes per game (11.5), while Arizona ranks 336th (5.9) in that category. The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 56.0% chance the Red Raiders cover and gives a C grade to Texas Tech +9.5.\n            ",

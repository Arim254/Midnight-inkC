    "body": "\n        A cross-conference NFL Week 13 matchup has the New England Patriots hosting the New York Giants on 'Monday Night Football' at 8:15 p.m. ET. Drake Maye is second in the MVP odds (+145), while Jaxson Dart is second in the Offensive Rookie of the Year odds (+230), as both will be popular in NFL player props and with a Patriots vs. Giants SGP. New England is a 7.5-point favorite to utilize in NFL picks, but the over/under of 46.5 points may be of even more interest. That's because the Over is a combined 9-3 for the two teams over their last six games.Your 'MNF' SGP could include a combination of predictions related to the total or spread, as well as NFL props in regard to a player, team or the game in general. Dart has seven rushing touchdowns across his seven pro starts, so are his +340 prop odds as an anytime touchdown scorer worth gambling on with an NFL same-game parlay? Dart also has an over/under of 201.5 passing yards and 27.5 rushing yards.

In his last game, Henry had a career high of 115 receiving yards which came on seven receptions, one of which ended in a touchdown. The seven grabs were one shy of tying a career high, and over New England's last five games in which it was favored, as is the case on 'MNF', Henry's gone over his receptions bar in four of those contests.New York has a bottom-10 pass defense and has already seen a pair of tight ends go off with nine-reception games against it this season. Henry will also enjoy the comforts of Gillette Stadium as he has more catches, yards and touchdowns at home than on the road, despite playing the same number of games. Henry is projected to have 5.2 receptions on average, as this plus-money NFL prop rated 4.5 stars could be a part of a winning 'Monday Night Football' SGP. See which other MNF same-game parlay picks to make here, and bet this prop here:How to make Giants vs. Patriots SGP picksIn addition, the SportsLine Machine Learning Model has seven other NFL props that are rated 4 stars or better, including one that returns plus money, that could be a part of your Patriots vs. Giants SGP picks. You can only see the Machine Learning Model's Monday Night Football NFL parlay at SportsLine.What are the model's top same-game parlay picks you should target with your Giants vs. Patriots predictions?

    "body": "\n        The New England Patriots (10-2) host the New York Giants (2-10) on Monday Night Football to wrap up the Week 13 NFL schedule between two franchises with plenty of history. The Patriots and Giants have played in some of the most memorable games in NFL history, but Tom Brady or Eli Manning won't be stepping on the field Monday. It's unfair to compare anyone to Brady, but the Patriots may have found their quarterback of the future in Drake Maye. Meanwhile, the Giants have struggled to find consistency at that position since Manning retired. These two franchises are trending in opposite directions, as the Patriots have won nine straight while the Giants have lost six straight. The Patriots are favored by 7.5 points, according to the latest Giants vs. Patriots odds, while the over/under for total points scored is 46.5.There are dozens of betting options if you're wondering how to bet on the NFL, or more specifically, Patriots vs. Giants.

New England has taken advantage of a softer schedule, going 7-1 against teams entering Week 13 with a losing record. And the Patriots find themselves against an inferior team again, with the Giants at 2-10 this season and on a six-game losing streak. New England has won nine straight games en route to a 10-2 start. Jaxson Dart (concussion) is back for the Giants, but he could show some rust as he's missed the last two weeks. Drake Maye is third in the NFL in passing yards (3,130) and near the top of the odds board for the NFL MVP race, and a big-time Monday Night Football performance can enhance his MVP chances. The model projects the Patriots to cover in 53% of simulations.Over 46.5 pointsAgain, not calling these two quarterbacks Tom Brady and Eli Manning yet, but both Maye and Dart have shown a high upside early in their NFL careers. Many were unsure if Dart would play his rookie season, but a strong preseason was the first sign he was ready for NFL competition. And once he took over for Russell Wilson, Dart proved worthy. The Giants are averaging 23.6 ppg in Dart's seven starts this season, compared to averaging 16.1 ppg last season. Meanwhile, the Patriots have the No. 7 scoring offense in the NFL at 26.5 ppg this season, including 28.7 ppg during their nine-game winning streak. New England has at least 24 points in seven straight games, and the Giants have the No. 30 scoring defense at 27.8 ppg allowed this season. The model projects 48 total points in this matchup.Responsible gamingResponsible gaming is a serious topic, and all sportsbooks take steps to ensure users play responsibly.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 Ryder Cup didn't end up as a lopsided defeat for the United States, thanks to a wild Sunday surge in singles. That was too little too late, considering Europe had built up a massive lead over the first two days to become the first team to win an away Ryder Cup since 2012. There was no shortage of blame passed around after the U.S. side fell short at home, and captain Keegan Bradley bore the brunt of it, especially when it came to complaints about the course setup at Bethpage BlackKnown as one of golf's toughest tests, Bethpage Black was neutered by a decision to cut down the rough. Rain early in the week softened the greens, and the Europeans crushed the Americans across the first two days thanks to a red-hot putting display on greens that lacked the fire most expected. That was apparently a point of contention between the U.S. team and the greens staff at Bethpage Black, and the greens were noticeably quicker on Sunday when the Americans made their charge. Bradley was largely blamed for specifying how the green should run, but Justin Thomas confirmed that the course staff and the U.S. team argued over the green speeds through the week during a recent appearance on the No Laying Up podcast.\n\"I don't know why they weren't at all what Keegan had asked for,\" Thomas said. \"I mean, he had been pretty clear of asking for a certain speed and wanting it fast enough. I watched them argue with us that they were 13s [on the Stimpmeter]. It's like, 'Guys, we play golf every week, like, look on TV at how many guys are leaving putts short. Nobody is getting ... You can't have a putt roll 3-4 feet past the hole. Like, these greens are slow. Speed them up.'\"\"It was just bizarre because that's not something you would expect at a home Ryder Cup. And again, that's not an excuse. They had to adjust to them just as much as we did,\" Thomas added. \"But that's kind of a fun advantage you generally have is being able to [set up the course] a little bit, and it was just so frustrating that we were being fought with and argued with on the speed of the greens that we asked for. So that was bizarre.\"To Thomas' point, none of this is an excuse for the Americans' poor performance on Friday and Saturday. Still, it is certainly not the situation a team wants to experience when choosing the course setup is supposed to be one of the main advantages for the home side. \nThat will be something the PGA of America will have to address ahead the next Ryder Cup staged stateside, as the course staff must be willing to adapt if the greens aren't where the team wants them. Perhaps they were rolling 13 on the Stimpmeter, but if the team says they need to be faster, then you have to try everything you can to speed them up rather than pushing back. At the same time, the U.S. side must be able to adjust and perform better, even if they aren't getting the exact conditions they wanted. Softer greens are harder to speed up, and with the rain that the course took on the week of the Ryder Cup, the U.S. team had to play better in the conditions that confronted them. While cutting down the rough was an own goal by Bradley, the way the greens played was perhaps not his fault after all.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        For the first time in their long and celebrated careers, Dick Vitale and Charles Barkley will share the broadcast booth for an NCAA Tournament game, bringing together more than 100 years of combined basketball experience. The pairing will call a First Four matchup as part of CBS Sports and TNT Sports' coverage.Before that, the duo will make their regular-season broadcast debut for No. 22 Indiana at No. 17 Kentucky on Saturday, Dec. 13 on ESPN. Vitale's presence in the booth is particularly notable given his recent health journey. The Hall of Fame broadcaster, 86, revealed in September that he is currently cancer-free following a PET scan. Over the past four years, Vitale has faced multiple diagnoses, including melanoma, lymphoma and laryngeal cancer, each successfully treated.Vitale returned to broadcasting earlier this year, courtside for then-No. 2 Duke's matchup against Clemson -- his first on-air assignment in 22 months. He has called more than 1,000 games in his career, becoming one of the most enduring and beloved voices in college basketball.\nBarkley, an award-winning analyst on TNT's Inside the NBA for 25 years, brings a contrasting style to Vitale's high-energy, storytelling-driven approach. The combination of Vitale's passion and Barkley's candid insight promises to deliver a broadcast filled with personality, humor and basketball expertise.\"Dick has meant so much to the game of basketball, and we have long felt he deserved an opportunity to call an NCAA Men's Tournament game, and we are delighted he has finally agreed following several offers,\" said Harold Bryant, CBS Sports' executive producer and executive vice president for production. \"Having him call the game with Charles will be must-see TV and a great way to tip off the First Four.\"\nThe First Four pairing gives fans a rare chance to see two legends of the game together, blending decades of experience, perspective and plenty of personality. While the matchups themselves carry high stakes for the teams involved, Vitale and Barkley's presence ensures the broadcast will be just as memorable for the commentary off the court as the action on it.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Devin Williams is changing boroughs. Williams and the New York Mets have agreed to a three-year contract, reports The Athletic. The deal includes $45 million in salary plus a $6 million signing bonus and deferrals, according to the New York Post. The team has not yet announced the move. The signing reunites Williams with David Stearns. Williams was a minor leaguer with the Milwaukee Brewers when the club named Stearns their general manager in September 2015, and the two overlapped in the organization until Stearns left to take over the Mets two years ago. Surely that relationship played a role in the signing.Williams, 31, spent this past season across town with the Yankees and had a turbulent season, throwing 62 innings with a 4.79 ERA. He allowed 37 runs in 2025 after allowing 33 runs combined from 2022-24. Williams was dominant at times, however, and he finished the season with 90 strikeouts in those 62 innings. He was a trusted late-inning reliever in the postseason. \n\"At first it was a challenge, but I've grown to love being here,\" Williams said after the Yankees were eliminated from the postseason. \"I love this city. I love taking the train to the field every day.\" We ranked Williams as the 19th-best free agent available this offseason, and the second best reliever behind erstwhile Mets closer Edwin Díaz. Here's the write-up: \n\"High-Lev Dev\" is a strong rebound candidate based on, if nothing  else, the incongruity between his ERA and his underlying data. There  were 21 pitchers who made 30 or more appearances in 2025 without any  starts and who possessed a strikeout rate above 30% and a walk rate  below 10%. Williams' 4.79 ERA was the worst of the group, which as a  whole put up a 2.76 mark -- to the extent that the next worst ERA was  just over 4.00. Williams somehow managed that while sporting the fourth-best hard-hit percentage of the bunch, behind names like Josh Hader and Abner Uribe.  Things happen in this game sometimes, particularly with individual  relief seasons. There's no compelling reason to think Williams has lost  his touch just yet. \tWe explained further why Williams, despite his disappointing season with the Yankees, was a highly coveted free agent with a chance to bounce back to his All-Star form. The Williams signing does not necessarily preclude Díaz returning to the Mets, though it does make it less likely. New York's bullpen was in rough shape most of the 2025 season and it could be that they hope to pair Williams with Díaz rather than have Williams replace Díaz. Either way, Williams figures to be the first reliever the Mets acquire this winter, not the only one. Lefties Brooks Raley and A.J. Minter are the only other locks for New York's bullpen at the moment. Minter missed most of this past season with season-ending lat surgery. Righty Huascar Brazoban is a candidate for another bullpen spot.  \nThe Yankees did not make Williams the $22.025 million qualifying offer, so they will not receive a compensation draft pick for losing him nor will the Mets surrender draft picks to sign him. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The U.S. women's national team closed out 2025 on a high with a 2-0 win over Italy on Monday, the performance showcasing the progress the group has made since head coach Emma Hayes began a year-long experimentation period as she rebuilds the team with the 2027 Women's World Cup in mind.Three days removed from a 3-0 win over the same opponent, Hayes made five changes to the lineup that started on Friday and reaped the rewards for her selections in more ways than one. Fresh off bagging a brace in their previous meeting against Italy, Catarina Macario scored the USWNT's opener in the 20th minute. Lily Yohannes expertly saw Macario running into space and made the pass from the halfway line, with Macario meeting the ball before making a long run into the box and putting a curled shot into the back of the net.\nThe USWNT doubled their lead in the 41st minute through Jaedyn Shaw, who connected with Alyssa Thompson for the goal. Thompson spotted Shaw and played a long pass through traffic to her teammate, with Shaw eventually making her way to the edge of the penalty area before slotting the ball past Italy goalkeeper Francesca Durante.\nMuch like they did three days earlier, the USWNT were dominant in possession but created fewer meaningful goalscoring opportunities along the way, their shot count dropping from 19 on Friday to 16 on Monday. The U.S. also posted just 1.44 expected goals on Monday, their second-lowest total all year long, though they effectively shut Italy completely out of the game. Italy mustered 1.21 expected goals from seven chances on Friday and became the latest team to expose the USWNT's shakiness when defending set pieces but on Monday, the visitors had just 0.31 expected goals from six shots.\nThe USWNT return to play in the new year with a friendly against Paraguay on Jan. 24, the latest step in the team's progression to the Concacaf W Championship in November, which will serve as the qualification tournament for the 2027 World Cup.The USWNT's stacked attackMacario and Shaw were the latest players to have their moment in the sun in a year full of them for the USWNT's young stars, each of them translating their strong club form to the national team. Chelsea's Macario now has seven goals and three assists in her last 14 matches for club and country, while Shaw has three goals and one assist in her last five, playing a major role in Gotham's run to the NWSL Championship. Their outings offer a stark reminder that Hayes treats club form as foundational in earning a call-up to the national team, the pair continuing to live up to the hype as important new additions to a USWNT attack that has historically been the team's defining aspect.For Macario in particular, the games against Italy have finally allowed the attacker to live up to her promise after several injury-plagued years. She boasts a versatility that makes her an easy addition to any USWNT roster but Hayes has frequently deputized her as a No. 9, which may be her role with the team going forward. Alongside the likes of Shaw and Alyssa Thompson, who also started on Monday, Macario helps to quash any concerns about the USWNT's depth in attack. Hayes has had to spend the vast majority of 2025 without the triple espresso of Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson, who combined for 10 goals during the team's gold medal-winning run at the 2024 Olympic Games. The USWNT have not missed the trio all that much, setting up for a competitive race for roster spots and playing time as the World Cup nears.\nThe USWNT's year of opportunityHayes now has 30 matches under her belt as the USWNT head coach and has handed starts to 50 different players along the way, the most of anyone in her position during that stretch of games. The player pool is as wide-open as it has ever been as a result, meaning the race for minutes will not be exclusive to the attacking positions.The head coach will now spend much of 2026 locking in her top choices for different roles, though it seems like a few players are inching closer to starting roles than others. The goalkeeper position just might be down to two players in Phallon Tullis-Joyce and Claudia Dickey, with Dickey starting both games against Italy while Tullis-Joyce battles a fractured eye socket. Naomi Girma still has a hold on a starting position as a center back, while the USWNT are better when 18-year-old midfielder Lily Yohannes is on the field.Many of the other positions seem to be up for grabs, either waiting for a player recovering from a long-term injury or on the way back from maternity leave or paving the way for an up-and-comer to assume the role. Each and every friendly en route to the Concacaf W Championship in November will essentially be an audition for those spots but one thing feels certain – Hayes' version of the team already looks vastly different than the one she inherited, at the very least proving that the U.S. team has the depth needed to make deep runs in major tournaments.\n            ",

Platinum recording artist Toosii, whose legal name is Nau'Jour Grainger, announced his commitment to the Orange, pausing his music career to pursue college football.Born in Syracuse, Grainger moved to North Carolina as a teenager and began his music career. In 2020, his single \"Love Cycle\" went platinum, and his single \"Poetic Pain\" reached gold certification. In 2023, Grainger really flew up the charts when his single \"Favorite Song\" went viral on TikTok and reached double platinum certification.In high school, Grainger played wide receiver and returned kicks for Rolesville (N.C.) High. Now 25 years old, Grainger resumes his career as a Syracuse wide receiver.\n\"For every kid who ever had a dream, make it reality,\" Grainger wrote in his announcement. \"God's will is the way and no one can stop it not even the devil. I wanna thank my lord and savior Jesus Christ for even giving me the strength to chase what I believed when so many people told me I couldn't. Thank you to the people who supported me as well, it never go unnoticed. To be born in Syracuse and move to North Carolina at age 12 and haven't been back since. When Coach Fran called, I knew it was a sign from God. So with that being said, Cuse I'm coming home.\"Since announcing his return to football in August, Grainger visited NC State and Duke while receiving a scholarship offer from Sacramento State, according to 247Sports.\nGrainger joins the 2026 Syracuse signing class, which currently sits at No. 30 in the nation and No. 5 in the ACC, per the 247Sports Team Rankings.\n            \n    ",

The video includes audio of someone telling Patullo to \"Get the f--- out of Philly.\" The Moorestown Police Department has stated that the investigation is ongoing. Patullo's home was vandalized following another tough outing for the Eagles' offense. Against the Bears, Philadelphia's offense managed to score just 15 points while committing two turnovers. The Eagles' running game was once again a non-factor as Saquon Barkley carried the ball just 13 times for 56 yards. Through 12 games, the Eagles' offense is currently 19th in the NFL in scoring, 23rd in passing, 22nd in rushing and 28th in third down efficiency. Philadelphia is getting it done in the red zone, however, as it is currently tops in the NFL with a 75.9% touchdown rate inside the opponents' 20-yard-line. \nWhile he said that he will evaluate everything following the loss to Chicago, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni stated that Patullo will continue to serve as his offensive play-caller. Patullo, 44, has been on Sirianni's staff since he took over as the Eagles' coach back in 2021. \"I have confidence in the entire group,\" Sirianni said. \"I know it will keep coming back to Kevin. If I thought it was one thing, I'd make those changes. Obviously, it's a lot of different things. I don't think it's Kevin.\"\nDespite their offensive struggles, the Eagles will head into their Week 14 with the Chargers with an 8-4 record and in first place in the NFC East. \n            \n    ",

Herbert is considered day-to-day, and his status for the Week 14 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night is to be determined. Herbert injured his hand on the Chargers' opening drive, which was capped by a 10-yard Quentin Johnston touchdown. The star signal-caller hurt his hand after taking a big hit from Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn, but he appeared to be OK. \nFollowing the opening scoring drive, Herbert exited the sideline and jogged to the locker room. Trey Lance took over at quarterback on L.A.'s next drive. When Herbert returned to the game that very same drive, he sported a large protective glove. \nHerbert completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception vs. the Raiders, and passed Dan Marino for the third-most passing yards (23,935) in a quarterback's first six seasons in NFL history. Los Angeles relied on its rushing attack Sunday, as Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson combined for 180 yards and two touchdowns on the ground. Herbert told reporters he's treating this week as if he's playing, per ESPN. He will surely be pushing to play, and will need to wear a protective device on that injured hand, but it's possible Lance could make his first start for L.A. in Week 14.\nThe former No. 3 overall pick of the San Francisco 49ers made one start for the Dallas Cowboys last year, a 23-19 loss to the Washington Commanders in which he completed 20 of 34 passes for 244 yards. Lance is 2-3 in his career as a starter. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Florida athletic director Scott Sricklin introduced Jon Sumrall as the school's next football coach on Monday. And after that introduction was made, Stricklin spent a bulk of time answering questions about the candidate who did not accept the job. We, of course, would be talking about Lane Kiffin.The Gators' interest in Kiffin was no secret, but the two sides never came to an agreement, and Kiffin was introduced as the new LSU coach shortly after Sumrall took the podium in Gainesville. Stricklin admitted he didn't know why Kiffin turned down the Florida job but felt like they had some \"productive conversations\" throughout the process.\"He's a fascinating guy, and I respect his decision,\" Stricklin said, per The Independent Florida Alligator. \"I don't know why he made the decision he did, but, I would say we had productive conversations.\"Stricklin denied the rumors that he and Kiffin didn't mesh well in interviews, saying that there is a lot of \"false information\" going around about the coaching search.\"There's a lot of twisted information, and a lot of people trying to create narratives that benefit themselves,\" Stricklin said. \"And so look, I said earlier, I'm not gonna talk about any other candidates, but Lane was a pretty visible candidate.\"\nCBS Sports' own John Talty chronicled the chaos that was the Kiffin courtship by Florida, LSU and Ole Miss. In that article, Talty reports that initial talks between Kiffin and Stricklin weren't exactly smooth. Part of the disconnect was Florida's insistence on having a general manager who would report directly to the next coach.\n        \n            \n                Inside the weeks of turmoil that drove Lane Kiffin from Ole Miss to LSU -- with a hard pass on Florida\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nUltimately, Kiffin passed on the opportunity to coach the Gators and wound up in Baton Rouge. Stricklin was pleased that Florida ended up where it did -- with Sumrall in charge after another great season at the Group of Five level. Stricklin also said he holds no ill will toward other parties involved in the process.\"I'm really happy with where we are,\" Stricklin said. \"I wish him the best. I wish all the schools involved the best, except for when we play them.\"\nWhen it became clearer that Kiffin was leaning away from Florida, Stricklin said he knew the Gators had to act fast because there would be \"a line out the door\" for Sumrall, who came recommended by Urban Meyer. Auburn was reportedly interested in Sumrall, but Florida was able to lure him away from Tulane after pivoting away from Kiffin.\n            ",

They're coming off a closer-than-expected victory over the Cincinnati Bengals last week, their third one-score win over their last four games. They can maintain their hold on the top spot in the conference with a win here before they head into their Week 14 bye.The Giants lost in overtime against the Lions last week, coming from ahead to take their sixth consecutive defeat. The Giants will get rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart back in the lineup after Jameis Winston started the last two weeks, but they're only playing for draft position at this point in their season.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL playoff picture: Who's in, who's out and who's in the hunt after Colts and Rams go down in Week 13\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWill the Patriots continue their winning streak, or will the Giants snap their losing streak and deal the Pats an upset under the lights of Monday night? We'll find out soon enough. But before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.Where to watch Patriots vs. Giants liveDate: Monday, Dec. 1 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium (Foxborough, Massachusetts)TV: ESPN/ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free) Follow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -7.5, O/U 46.5 via DraftKings SportsbookLIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Patriots battle the  on \"Monday Night Football.\"Key storylinesJaxson Dart's return. Dart missed last week's game against the Lions and Week 11 against the Packers with a concussion but is set to return on Monday night. This will be his first game in the post-Brian Daboll era, with former offensive coordinator Mike Kafka now at the helm. Dart has played well so far this year, completing 62.7% of his passes at an average of 6.8 yards per attempt with 10 touchdowns and three interceptions, while also adding 317 yards and seven scores on the ground. He desperately needs to figure out a way to take fewer hits both inside and outside the pocket, and we'll get our first chance on Monday night to see if he has learned how to slide.Drake Maye's MVP case. After Matthew Stafford's three turnovers in the Rams' loss to the Panthers on Sunday, Maye has a chance to move into the lead in the MVP race. He hasn't had a blow-up game in a few weeks now, having more muted performances in recent weeks, but if he can tear up the Giants' defense, then he can solidify himself as the front-runner heading into the Patriots' bye week. Concerns for Giants defense. New York gave up 494 yards, 23 first downs and 34 points to the Lions last week, including 237 yards on the ground in an all-time performance by Jahmyr Gibbs, which led to the firing of defensive coordinator Shane Bowen (Charlie Bullen will now be calling the defense as interim defensive coordinator). The Giants are 30th in the league in both yards and points allowed, as well as 31st in Tru Media's version of EPA per play allowed. For a team that was supposed to be built around a strong defense buoyed by an elite defensive front, it has simply not been that. Instead, the Giants have been pushed around up front for most of the year. They're fortunate here that the Patriots will be without two starting offensive linemen.Patriots gunning for top seed. After Denver's win over Washington on Sunday night, the Patriots need to win here to retake the No. 1 seed in the AFC. (The Broncos are currently ahead due to tiebreakers.) After their bye week, the Pats return with a pair of tougher games against the Bills and Ravens, but finish out with easy division games against the Jets and Dolphins. Meanwhile, the Broncos have games remaining against the Raiders, Packers, Jaguars, Chiefs and Chargers. It's going to be a dog fight down the stretch for the first-round bye.Prediction\nThe Giants get Jaxson Dart back here, but I'm more concerned about their defense than I am about their offense. They are getting clocked on the ground to the tune of 5.9 (FIVE POINT NINE) yards per carry and just gave up 200 million yards (approximately) to Jahmyr Gibbs in Week 12. TreVeyon Henderson isn't Gibbs, obviously, but he has the ability to rip off huge chunk gains. And New England still has Drake Maye playing really well. \nPrediction: Patriots 30, Giants 20\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        In the early window of games on Sunday of Week 13 in the NFL, the New York Jets and New Orleans Saints -- both of whom had two wins headed into the day -- had opportunities to win. The Jets won on a walk-off field goal from Nick Folk whereas a late potential go-ahead drive by the Saints fell short on fourth-and-1. There are two games featuring teams with four wins or fewer next week: Titans at Browns and Commanders at Vikings. All four of those teams are in the top 10 overall range. Week 14 is also the last week of byes.As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon) as well as potential team needs:\n1. Tennessee Titans (1-11)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEJacksonville did not play with its food Sunday as the Titans were washed away with the tide. Tennessee has a firm grip on the No. 1 overall pick with a date against the Browns next weekend. 2. New York Giants (2-11)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTNew York traveled to New England for \"Monday Night Football\" and got torched in Jaxson Dart's return from a concussion.3. New Orleans Saints (2-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans was driving with a chance to take the lead over Miami in the final minute, but the Saints failed to convert a 4th-and-1 that would have kept the drive going in Dolphins territory. \n4. Las Vegas Raiders (2-10)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTThe Raiders offense was no more threatening in a post-Chip Kelly world. Ashton Jeanty has only broken 75 rushing yards once this season. 5. Cleveland Browns (3-9)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLShedeur Sanders started the second game of his young NFL career, but, like others before him, was unable to get the Browns offense in gear.6. Washington Commanders (3-9)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington lost a heartbreaker in OT to Denver on \"Sunday Night Football.'' Jayden Daniels is said to be nearing his return to the football field, but a return to the postseason is already out of reach.  \n7. New York Jets (3-9)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TERedemption for Nick Folk! The 41-year-old converted a 56-yard field goal after the Jets had a false start earlier. 8. Arizona Cardinals (3-9)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBArizona attempted to become the latest thorn in Tampa Bay's side, but its upset bid fell short. Since winning the first two games of the season, the Cardinals have lost nine of their last 10.9. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (4-8)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta and Kirk Cousins were involved in a tightly contested affair Sunday. Their loss was Los Angeles' gain as the Rams are currently in position to pick top 10 overall. \n10. Cincinnati Bengals (4-8)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGEJoe Burrow must have shaken off the rust in practice because it looked as though he was back in midseason form; earlier than scheduled. The Bengals are still on the prowl. 11. Minnesota Vikings (4-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBMax Brosmer, J.J. McCarthy, the outcome is all the same. Minnesota has failed to score 20 points or more in four straight games. 12. Miami Dolphins (5-7)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SMiami has won four of its last five games, including three straight. In theory, the Dolphins still have an outside shot at the playoffs.\n13. Kansas City Chiefs (6-6)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEKansas City's playoff hopes are very much hanging in the balance after losing to Dallas on Thanksgiving Day. There is a logjam in the AFC playoff race and the Chiefs can ill afford to lose any more ground. 14. Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6)Projected needs: QB, DL, WR, CB, IOLPittsburgh could not capitalize on Baltimore's Thanksgiving loss. The Steelers failed to score in the second half against the Bills.15. Carolina Panthers (7-6)Projected needs: CB, S, IOL, WR, DLCarolina has been one of the most inconsistent teams of the season. The Panthers were demolished by the Bills and lost to the Saints, but then defeated the Packers and Rams. The Panthers may be just as capable of winning every game as they are losing. \n16. Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas has won three straight games with critical victories over the Eagles and Chiefs. The Cowboys' final five games set up well for the franchise to push for the NFC playoffs. 17. Detroit Lions (7-5)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTSince winning four consecutive games in September and early October, the Lions have neither won nor lost back-to-back games. To continue on that trajectory, Detroit would need a win against the Cowboys on Thursday night. 18. Houston Texans (7-5)Projected needs: IOL, OT, TE, DL, SAlthough the quarterback may have been different -- C.J. Stroud returned to the starting lineup for Davis Mills -- Houston, with backs against the wall, won its fourth consecutive game as the Colts loosen their grip on the AFC South lead.\n19. Baltimore Ravens (6-6)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBBaltimore had surged to regain the AFC North lead, but Cincinnati put an end to its five-game win streak on Thanksgiving.20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TETampa Bay narrowly avoided losing its fourth consecutive game. Carolina is suddenly pushing for the NFC South title. 21. Buffalo Bills (8-4)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, CB, WRThe Bills have an opportunity to achieve some positive momentum going into the playoffs.\n22. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Projected needs: TE, CB, EDGE, S, IOLIn each of the past two weeks, A.J. Brown has eclipsed 100 receiving yards and in each of those two games, the Eagles have lost. Perhaps it would serve them well to have a bit less pressure on them. 23. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-4)Projected needs: LB, CB, EDGE, IOL, DLJets and Browns fans are equally attentive to the AFC South race, which has suddenly drawn even with five games to play. Cleveland holds the rights to Jacksonville's first-round pick and the Jets hold Indianapolis' pick.24. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Projected needs: OT, IOL, DL, WR, TESan Francisco did not need much to put away the Browns given its opposition's lack of offensive consistency. The 49ers were set up for an initial score by a long punt return and used a few well-timed explosives to score their remaining points. Cleveland actually outgained San Francisco, 253-252.\n25. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Projected needs: IOL, EDGE, CB, TE, DLJustin Herbert suffered a fractured left hand against the Raiders, but helped the Chargers continue to keep pace in the AFC playoff hunt. 26. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville has won three consecutive games and is now in the mix to win the AFC South. Sunday's outcome against the Titans was never in doubt.27. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBAlthough the jerseys may have changed, Micah Parsons continued his personal tradition of playing on Thanksgiving. His new team and former team were victorious.28. Seattle Seahawks (9-3)Projected needs: CB, DL, IOL, S, WRSam Darnold enacted revenge on his former team as Minnesota has struggled to lock in on his replacement. Three teams in the NFC West have nine wins. 29. Los Angeles Rams (9-3)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLLos Angeles' season suffered a surprising setback with Sunday's loss to the Panthers. Puka Nacua delivered a few highlight-reel moments.30. Denver Broncos (10-2)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTDenver escaped in OT in a wild game against Washington on \"Sunday Night Football\" and took over the No. 1 seed in the AFC in the process.31. Chicago Bears (9-3)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTWith five games remaining, it is neither the Eagles, Packers, 49ers or Lions with the NFC's best record; it is the Bears (along with the Rams). Ben Johnson has revitalized what had been a self-deprecating fan base in recent years. 32. New England Patriots (11-2)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEThe Patriots won their 10th straight game by dismantling a lowly Giants team on Monday night.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place from April 23-25 in Pittsburgh.

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL season has officially reached its home stretch. As we march further into Week 13 after Thanksgiving's tripleheader and a Black Friday upset, only five full weeks of regular-season action remain until the start of the playoffs. The postseason picture is far from finalized, but it's really taking shape -- including in the fight for top seeding -- thanks to late-year contests.The current field features a bevy of unexpected heavyweights, including the Denver Broncos, who survived a thriller on \"Sunday Night Football\" for their ninth straight win; the Chicago Bears, who overpowered the reigning champion Philadelphia Eagles a day after Thanksgiving; and the Seattle Seahawks, who've enjoyed top-level production from Sam Darnold under center.Where, exactly, do all the playoff contenders sit after Week 13? Which teams would be in the postseason if the schedule were halted today? And which clubs still have a shot to sneak into the mix down the stretch? Below is an updated rundown of the entire playoff picture, complete with remaining schedules for primary contenders:Complete playoff pictureThis is the NFL playoff picture as it stands, with the following teams tabbed for postseason spots:\nAFC standingsNew England Patriots (11-2)Denver Broncos (10-2)Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4)Baltimore Ravens (6-6)Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Indianapolis Colts (8-4)Buffalo Bills (8-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. New England Patriots (11-2)Remaining schedule: vs. Bills, at Ravens, at Jets, vs. DolphinsDrake Maye is still on an MVP-caliber run as the face of Mike Vrabel's lineup, and the remaining slate sets them up well for the Patriots' first AFC East title since Tom Brady's final season with the club in 2019. Two of the Pats' final four opponents have losing records, and three of those four fall within the division.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Denver Broncos (10-2)Remaining schedule: at Raiders, vs. Packers, vs. Jaguars, at Chiefs, vs. ChargersDenver is buoyed by Bo Nix's late-game composure and a stellar defense led by Vance Joseph. Dates with the rival Chiefs and Chargers in the final two weeks of the season will likely determine whether the Broncos can rob Kansas City of its 10th straight division crown. But this group is all but a lock to play January ball.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Colts, vs. Jets, at Broncos, at Colts, vs. TitansThe mercurial Jaguars have been undisciplined for much of the year, but they've now won three of their last four, rolling over the lowly Titans on Sunday. Their light late-season schedule might send Liam Coen's squad into the dance with confidence.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Baltimore Ravens (6-6)Remaining schedule: vs. Steelers, at Bengals, vs. Patriots, at Packers, at SteelersThe Ravens backed into the AFC North lead thanks to the Steelers' loss to the Bills. Though talented, they are just so sloppy, with Lamar Jackson in a funk and John Harbaugh's group losing the ball like crazy on Thanksgiving. The division could come down to a Week 18 game in Pittsburgh. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (8-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Eagles, at Chiefs, at Cowboys, vs. Texans, at BroncosAmong the current wild card contenders, the Chargers might be in the most danger of losing their spot entirely despite a convincing win over the Raiders in Week 13. Down the stretch, the Bolts will be up against some of the NFL's best defenses while struggling to keep Justin Herbert comfortable behind a depleted offensive line.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Indianapolis Colts (8-4)Remaining schedule: at Jaguars, at Seahawks, vs. 49ers, vs. Jaguars, at Texans  Can Daniel Jones rediscover the early-year efficiency that made him a stunning breakout? He'll have to do so against some stingy defenses down the stretch, with almost every one of Indianapolis' remaining opponents boasting a top 10 scoring \"D.\" Accordingly, the Colts are the safest bet to keep slipping in these standings.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Buffalo Bills (8-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Bengals, at Patriots, at Browns, vs. Eagles, vs. JetsJosh Allen is still capable of playing Superman, as evidenced in Buffalo's Week 11 win over Tampa Bay. But Sean McDermott's defense has been more volatile. New England may be out of reach atop the AFC East, but the Bills have a relatively clear path to a wild card berth if they can claim two or three of their final five matchups.In the huntThe Texans (7-5) aren't to be written off in the South, with DeMeco Ryans' defense ranking No. 1 in the NFL. The Steelers (6-6) are still alive in the AFC North race despite dropping five of their past seven games. The Chiefs (6-6) finally rediscovered their late-game flair against the Colts in Week 12, but Patrick Mahomes' last-gasp heroics weren't enough to mask greater offensive issues on Thanksgiving.NFC standingsChicago Bears (9-3)Los Angeles Rams (9-3)Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5)Seattle Seahawks (9-3)Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)San Francisco 49ers (9-4)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Chicago Bears (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Packers, vs. Browns, vs. Packers, at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears, who looked more scrappy than special for a long time, are seemingly proving to the naysayers that they are true contenders after knocking off the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles in convincing fashion. Up next will be the potentially tall task of holding off the NFC North-rival Packers.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Los Angeles Rams (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Cardinals, vs. Lions, at Seahawks, at Falcons, vs. CardinalsMatthew Stafford is slinging it with as much, if not more, confidence than he did in his title-winning Rams debut. But the typically stingy defense was nowhere to be found in a Week 13 upset at the hands of the Panthers. L.A. should still be poised to feast on lesser clubs like Arizona and Atlanta moving forward. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (8-4)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, vs. Raiders, at Commanders, at Bills, vs. Commanders\nThe reigning Super Bowl champions are struggling down the stretch, losing their past two games to the Cowboys and Bears. Vic Fangio's physical defense seems to be wearing down, while the all-star offense isn't getting its typical push up front.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5)Remaining schedule: vs. Saints, vs. Falcons, at Panthers, at Dolphins, vs. PanthersEvery year, the Bucs scrape their way through the NFC South race, regardless of who's healthy around Baker Mayfield. The remaining schedule suggests a fifth straight division crown is well within reach, although Week 12's blowout loss to the Rams showed the Bucs may not be ready to hang with the heavyweights.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Seattle Seahawks (9-3)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. Colts, vs. Rams, at Panthers, at 49ersEven after falling to the rival Rams in Week 11, Seattle should hang around in the race for the NFC West title due to Mike Macdonald's physical defense. That unit was on full display in a Week 13 shutout win over the Vikings.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Green Bay Packers (8-3-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Bears, at Broncos, at Bears, vs. Ravens, at VikingsMatt LaFleur's offense has been more scattershot than usual over the course of the year, but the NFC North is still up for grabs with three divisional matchups still on tap. And the Pack took care of business on Thanksgiving with a showcase by Jordan Love and Micah Parsons, who could make Green Bay a sneakily scary contender.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. San Francisco 49ers (9-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Titans, at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksBrock Purdy has been up and down since his return from a lingering injury. Regardless, all year, the 49ers have hung around, and now their defense should get some more confidence-boosting matchups after impressive showings against both Carolina and Cleveland, including in Sunday's rout of the Browns.\nIn the huntThe Lions (7-5) aren't the juggernaut they were a year ago at this time, with Dan Campbell's signature fourth-down gambles coming up short, but their young playmakers should keep them in the fight until the end. The Cowboys (6-5-1) are still finding their defensive footing, but Dak Prescott is playing lights out at quarterback, wheeling and dealing with George Pickens at his disposal. The Panthers (7-6) remain in thick of the NFC South race with Sunday's upset win over the Rams. They are just a half game back of the Bucs, who they face two times down the stretch. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After the latest matchday of Champions League soccer, there's a new number one in the table, Mikel Arteta's Arsenal. The English side have been unbelievable this season and they also managed to win against Bayern Munich in the latest round of Champions League action, the first defeat of the season for the team coached by Vincent Kompany. Teams such as Inter or Barcelona are facing some ups and downs in their first part of the season, but they are definitely competing, while others, including Juventus or Jose Mourinho's Benfica, are going through a challenging season, despite their managerial changes. Let's take a look our Champions League Power Rankings five games in:Don't forget -- you can watch the UEFA Champions League all season long with every game airing on Paramount+.1. Arsenal (+1)The new leaders. After winning 3-1 against Bayern Munich, they are leading the standings with five wins in five matches, which is why the Gunners deserve to be here. Also, after Sunday's 1-1 draw against Chelsea, they have a five-point margin on Manchester City in the Premier League. This might be their season, finally. 2. Bayern Munich (-1)They have started the 2025-26 season nearly perfectly as they won 18 out of the 20 matches played so far, but also lost to Arsenal last week, losing the crown of being the only team unbeaten in the top five European leagues. It's obvious to consider them among the main candidates to win the Champions League, but the defeat to Arteta's team showed the first doubts about this incredible team. \n3. Barcelona (--)The team coached by Hansi Flick are finally back at the Spotify Camp Nou, their home stadium after two years of renovations, and it can definitely become a factor later this season. The 3-0 defeat against Chelsea last week showed they are still a team that have some blackouts, but they are the new LaLiga leaders after Real Madrid drew three matches in a row in the Spanish league. 4. PSG (--)The 2024-25 Champions League winners were deeply affected by injuries in this first part of the season, but this is something they can fix in the long term. Key players like 2025 Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele and African Player of the Year Achraf Hakimi are unavailable, and this is affecting their performances, as they are currently second in the Ligue 1 table after Saturday's defeat to AS Monaco. 5. Chelsea (+4)One of the best-looking teams around Europe. Enzo Maresca's side won against Barcelona in the Champions League last week and also drew 1-1 against Arsenal on Sunday, despite playing the majority of the match thanks to the silly red card by Moises Caicedo. They are improving fast. \n6. Manchester City (+1)It's clear that when there is a team like Manchester City with their roster and a manager like Pep Guardiola, it's impossible not to consider them among the candidates for the title, but they don't look to be as strong as in the past, at least until now. They lost 2-0 to Bayer Leverkusen at home last week but also won against Leeds United over the weekend, showing their inconsistency of results in this first part of the season. 7. Inter (-2)The 2023 and 2025 Champions League finalists kicked off their Champions League campaign with four wins in four games, but against teams that were not at their level. In fact, when they met Atletico Madrid on Wednesday last week, they lost 2-1 and showed they need some more work to be at the level of the past years. 8. Real Madrid (-1)The Spanish giants are always in the contention for a Champions League trophy, as their history has taught us. However, after a strong start to the season under the new manager Xabi Alonso, Real Madrid only won one of the last five matches played in all competitions, including three LaLiga draws against Rayo Vallecano, Elche and Girona, not the best teams of the league. Should Alonso start to worry? \n9. Liverpool (-1)The most disappointing team of the season until now. The team coached by Arne Slot, who dominated the 2024-25 season in England, made some outstanding transfer signings with players like Florian Wirtz or Alexander Isak. The 4-1 home defeat against PSV in the last matchday of the Champions League showed that things are really going bad for Slot and his team that next week will face Inter at San Siro. 10. Atletico Madrid (+2)Their first part of the season wasn't as great as we could have expected but the home win against Inter showed they are still the team we used to know. They also gained some points in their domestic league and are currently only three points behind Real Madrid in the standings. 11. Newcastle (-1)Despite losing their first home game of the league phase against Barcelona, Newcastle are still in a good spot to qualify directly to the knockout stages, but they need to improve in their consistency as they are currently in 14th place in the Premier League standings with 18 points after 13 matches. They can and they should do more. \n12. Galatasaray (-1)It's not surprising to see Galatasaray in this position, as they are a strong team with big ambitions after their summer business when they were able to sign Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen permanently. It's always difficult for a team to visit their home stadium in Istanbul with one of the most passionate fanbases in the world, but not for Union SG which won at their home stadium last week and surprised many. 13. Olympique Marseille (--)The side coached by Roberto De Zerbi is doing fantastic so far. They are only two points behind Lens in the Ligue 1 standings and also won 2-1 the last Champions League match against Newcastle, after three defeats against Real Madrid, Sporting CP and Atalanta. They are now back on track ahead of the next phase. 14. Tottenham (--)Thomas Frank's side have struggled in recent weeks and come from only one win in the last five Premier League matches, including another disappointing 2-1 home defeat against Fulham over the weekend. They also lost 5-3 to PSG last week, and conceded a total of 11 goals in the last three games. Too many. \n15. Borussia Dortmund (--)The 2024 Champions League finalists won the last two matches against Villarreal and Bayer Leverkusen and they are now back on track in both Bundesliga and Champions League standings. 16. Sporting CP (--)With 10 points after five matches, Sporting CP are in a good spot and they can potentially hope for a top-eight scenario if they do well in the next three matches of the league phase of the Champions League. 17. Napoli (+1)Despite the challenges and the issues they had so far with some concerning injuries like those of Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, Napoli are now back in a good spot in both Champions League and Serie A standings. After the 1-0 win against AS Roma over the weekend, the team coached by Antonio Conte are leading the Serie A standings alongside AC Milan.\n18. Atalanta (+2)Raffaele Palladino took over the club after Atalanta decided to sack Ivan Juric and he immediately had an impact. The Nerazzurri lost to Napoli but then won 3-0 against Eintracht in his first ever Champions League match as manager before winning 2-0 against Fiorentina over the weekend. It took more time than expected but Atalanta are now back under the new coach. 19. Juventus (--)Juventus also decided to sack their former coach and hired Luciano Spalletti who is having some issues to make an immediate impact but the Bianconeri won two important matches against Bodo/Glimt away and then against Cagliari. Juventus will face Napoli this Sunday, a key game to determine the status of the team. 20. Bayer Leverkusen (+1)A new manager like Kasper Hjulmand brought a rejuvenated air to the dressing room and to the team after the disappointing start under Erik ten Hag. They are now fully back on track and are expected to qualify for the next round of the Champions League after winning 2-0 against Manchester City away. Another huge result for them. \n21. AS Monaco (+1)They managed to win against PSG over the weekend, a key win for them after some disappointing results. They are behind in both Ligue 1 and Champions League standings, after the 2-2 draw against Pafos. However, Paul Pogba is finally back and played his first minutes with the team. 22. PSV (+1)Two wins so far in the league phase but both were unforgettable ones as the Dutch team managed to win 6-2 against Napoli in one of the most bizarre results of the tournament so far and then 4-1 at Anfield against Liverpool. Scoring 10 goals against the Serie A and Premier League title holders is just incredible. 23. Qarabag (-6)Maybe we overrated them a bit too much last time. After winning the first two matches of the league phase, they lost two and drew one. They are still hoping to land in a spot for the playoffs, but it's not guaranteed at all. \n24. Club Brugge (--)After winning their first home game of the league phase, they lost twice, drew 3-3 against Barcelona and then lost 3-0 to Sporting CP last week. Their talented roster might not be enough for them this season. 25. Eintracht Frankfurt (--)Losing 3-0 to Atalanta might put an end to their playoff hopes as they will face Barcelona, Qarabag and then Tottenham in the last three games of the league phase. At least they are doing better in the Bundesliga, currently sitting in seventh place. 26. Union Saint-Gilloise (+2)After a great 3-1 win against PSV in their opening game of the league phase, we all thought they could become one of the surprises of the season. They weren't until the unexpected 1-0 win against Galatasaray. They still have hopes. \n27. Athletic Club (-1)One win, three defeats and one draw in the opening five matches of the league phase. Not enough to have hopes to go further this season in the European campaign but they can still turn things around with the team they have, even if they face PSG, Atalanta and Sporting CP in the next three. 28. Villarreal (-1)Villarreal drew once against Juventus and then have four defeats in the five games they played. It's a strange situation, especially considering their excellent league form, sitting third and only two points off the top in LaLiga.29. Benfica (+1)Despite the appointment of Jose Mourinho Benfica are currently in 30th place and out of the playoffs. Next matches: Napoli, Juventus and Real Madrid. It will be difficult even for \"The Special One.\"30. Pafos (-1)The team from Cyprus are doing more than we could expect and they are in 25th place after their first historical Champions League win against Villarreal. However, it's unlikely to see them ending up in the top 24 of the league phase.31. Slavia Prague (--)Slavia Prague are struggling but we could see that coming. They are not a team at the level of the other ones competing in the league phase and they are where they should be. 32. Olympiacos (--)Another big disappointment of the Champions League season. No wins so far, three defeats and two draws. They could definitely do better. 33. Copenaghen (--)Despite the home draw against Bayer Leverkusen in their debut match in September, they later lost to Qarabag, Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham before winning the last match against Kairat. That was great but too late. 34. Bodo/Glimt (--) They gave Juventus all they could handle before losing late, but that's not going to get them anywhere in this competition. 35. Kairat (--)We all expected them to reach this stage of the tournament and, even though they were held to a 0-0 draw against Pafos, simply competing in the Champions League is already a historic achievement for the club. It could be worse...36. Ajax (--)One goal scored and 16 conceded, they sit bottom of the table with zero points. One of the biggest, most historic clubs in the world, an iconic logo in the sport, with nothing to show. There are no words.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Caleb Williams has produced off plenty of miraculous moments in the Chicago Bears' magical run this season. His latest escape act might just be his greatest. It also might have used up his seemingly endless reserve of magic.On a fourth-and-4 from the Los Angeles Rams' 9-yard line, Williams retreated all the way back to the 40-yard line before tossing up a perfect pass to tight end Cole Kmet for a game-tying touchdown.Kmet got himself open with a bit of hand fighting, allowing Williams' pass to land right in his bread basket on a last-gasp effort from Chicago. The touchdown tied Sunday night's game 17-17, though Los Angeles rallied in overtime to kick a walk-off field goal and win, 20-17, advancing to the NFC Championship.\nThe overhead view provides another perspective on Williams' wild throw. His protection fell apart almost instantaneously, and he had his back fully turned to the play before gathering himself and delivering the ball more than 51 yards through the air.\nAnd how about this field-level view?\nThe videos still somehow only does it partial justice. NFL Next Gen Stats specifies that Williams' 14-yard completion traveled 51.2 air yards, making it the \"longest\" completion in the red zone since at least 2016.That was as good as it got for the 2024 No. 1 pick out of USC. In overtime, the Bears' defense got a stop, setting up Williams and co. for a potential game-winning drive. Instead, Williams threw his third interception of the night, with Kamren Curl stepping in front of a deep pass intended for DJ Moore and making a remarkable diving, bobbling catch.\nMatthew Stafford then drove the Rams into field goal range, and Harrison Mevis delivered the game-winning field goal. The Rams will face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship.\nFor Williams, it ends an impressive bounce-back campaign after a tough rookie season. He had seven fourth-quarter comebacks this season (including the postseason), one shy of tying the single-season record. Last week in the Wild Card Round against the Green Bay Packers, he made a similarly incredible fourth-down play as the Bears, who trailed 21-6, won 31-27.\nThe Bears finished with an NFL-record seven wins in games they trailed in the final two minutes of regulation.But living in such small margins also meant mistakes like the one Williams made in overtime were devastating, and one of Williams' next steps will be limiting those mistakes. Though he was generally safe with the ball this season, Williams' accuracy inconsistencies continued to rear their ugly head, and they did so again in the worst moment Sunday. Williams had a 14.6% off-target rate this season, the highest in the NFL.\nSunday night's game proved to be a microcosm of the season as a whole: many tremendous highs and some frustrating lows. The biggest difference? The Bears ended up on the wrong side of the scoreboard.\n            ",

The Rams are now headed to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2021, a season that ended with them winning the Super Bowl. In the NFC title game, the Rams will be heading to Seattle to face the Seahawks for the third time this season. The teams split their two regular-season meetings with the Rams winning in Week 11 (21-19) and the Seahawks winning in Week 16 (38-37). The Seahawks earned their way to the NFC Championship by absolutely destroying the 49ers in a 41-6 win on Saturday night. The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years. In the AFC, the Denver Broncos are headed to the conference title game after beating the Buffalo Bills, 33-30 in overtime, in what was easily the wildest game of the divisional round. The Broncos' vaunted defense forced five turnovers, including four from Josh Allen, who threw two interceptions while also losing two fumbles. The top-seeded Broncos will now host New England in the AFC title game with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line. The Patriots advanced on Sunday after beating the Texans, 28-16. The Broncos and Patriots are facing each other in the AFC title game for the third time in 13 years. The two previous meetings were both played in Denver and the Broncos won both of them. If the Broncos are going to get to the Super Bowl this year, they're going to have to do it without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury against Buffalo. For the Patriots, it will mark their first trip to the conference title game since 2018 in what ended up being the final appearance by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. With that in mind, let's take a look at the full playoff schedule.Divisional Round scheduleSaturday, Jan. 17(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. The Broncos have had one of the best defenses in the NFL all year and Josh Allen found out firsthand why they're so good. The Bills turned the ball over five times with four of those coming from Allen. The Bills QB threw an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Bo Nix also came up big for the Broncos, throwing for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown and this game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. They also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. Sunday, Jan. 18(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has yet to make it to the conference title game. (5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play. The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Championship SundaySunday, Jan. 25\nAFC ChampionshipPatriots at Broncos, 3 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)NFC ChampionshipRams at Seahawks, 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox; Fubo, try for free)Super Bowl LXSunday, Feb. 8AFC champion vs. NFC champion at Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California), 6:30 p.m. ET (NBC)Wild Card resultsSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams 34-31 over (4) PanthersRams vs. Panthers recap: The Panthers almost pulled off the upset, but they couldn't stop Matthew Stafford with the game on the line. With the Rams trailing 31-27, Stafford engineered a 71-yard game-winning scoring drive that ended when he hit Colby Parkinson with a 19-yard touchdown with just 38 seconds left to play. Stafford threw for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the win. (2) Bears 31-27 over (7) PackersPackers vs. Bears recap: The Bears pulled off the third-largest fourth-quarter comeback in NFL history. Going into the final quarter, the Bears were trailing by 15 points, but they were able to erase that deficit during a miracle quarter where they outscored the Packers, 25-6. Caleb Williams threw for more yardage (184) in the fourth quarter than he did in the first three quarters combined (177). Williams capped things off with a 25-yard score to DJ Moore with just 1:43 left to win the game. Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills 27-24 over (3) JaguarsBills vs. Jaguars recap: For the first time in his career, Josh Allen led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. The Bills' franchise quarterback scored the game-winning touchdown on a 1-yard run with just one minute left to play. Allen also threw a 15-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter to help propel Buffalo to the win. Allen totaled 306 yards and three touchdowns in the win. For the Bills, it was their first road playoff win in 33 years. (6) 49ers 23-19 over (3) Eagles49ers vs. Eagles recap: The 49ers pulled off a shocker by going on the road and knocking off the Eagles. After losing George Kittle, the 49ers had some unlikely heroes, including Demarcus Robinson, who caught six passes for 111 yards and a touchdown. Christian McCaffrey also came up big with two touchdowns, including the game-winning score, which came on a 4-yard pass from Brock Purdy with just 2:54 left to play. (2) Patriots 16-3 over (7) ChargersChargers vs. Patriots recap: The Patriots defense took over and carried New England to the win. Justin Herbert was sacked six times as the Patriots kept the Chargers out of the end zone and held them to fewer than 210 total yards.The offense didn't light up the scoreboard, but Drake Maye was impressive in his first career postseason start, throwing for 268 yards and rushing for 66 more. The Patriots are headed to the divisional round for the first time since 2018.Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans 30-6 over (4) Steelers\nTexans vs. Steelers recap. The Texans had the best defense in the NFL during the regular season, and that unit carried them to a win against Pittsburgh. The Texans defense sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, held the Steelers to just 175 yards and scored two touchdowns, which both came in the fourth quarter. The first one came on a 33-yard fumble return by Sheldon Rankins, and then Calen Bullock followed that up with a 50-yard pick six with just 2:39 left in the game. It was a defensive masterpiece by a Texans team that picked up its first road win in franchise history\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Arizona Wildcats will earn all 61 first-place votes in the poll after earning 60 last week, made possible after Iowa State -- which earned the other first-place vote last Monday -- lost twice in two outings this week.Arizona's death grip on No. 1 is one of many notable changes coming to the poll Monday. I'm also anticipating UConn to rise to No. 2 while extending its streak of appearances inside the top five to 11 weeks. Also likely among the risers will be Purdue, Duke and Houston.Previously undefeated teams falling will largely be the underlying theme of the Week 11 poll Monday. Not only will Iowa State (which went from 16-0 to 16-2 this week) drop from No. 2 to out of the top five -- but so, too, will Vanderbilt (which also went from 16-0 to 16-2 this week). The Commodores' two losses comes the same week it climbed to its highest spot in the poll, No. 10, which will send it back outside the top-10 range once again.Plenty of other movement is expected in the poll Monday as well, and I am -- perhaps naively -- expecting voters to wise up and rank several worthy mid-major teams in Saint Louis and Miami (OH). The latter improved to 19-0 with a thrilling overtime win over Buffalo on Saturday, while the former squashed Richmond at home to get to 17-1 -- its best start to a season since the 1993-94 season.\nNeither have been ranked this season.

    "body": "\n        The first tournament of the 2026 PGA Tour season produced a winner who has made a habit of raising trophies in his limited time on the circuit. Chris Gotterup blended power and touch like a seasoned veteran at the 2026 Sony Open as the third-year player crafted a masterclass on Sunday with a final-round 64 to put him at 16 under for the tournament, two strokes clear of runner-up Ryan Gerard.Gotterup's triumph at Waialae Country Club marks his third on the PGA Tour in as many seasons as he entered the winner's circle in Myrtle Beach his rookie year before outclassing Rory McIlroy at the Scottish Open last summer. The 26-year-old now trails only McIlroy (eight) and Scottie Scheffler (four) among active players in terms of consecutive seasons with a PGA Tour win. He is also the sixth player since 2024 to collect three or more wins.After opening his season with a 7-under 63, Gotterup entered the final round at 10 under and two strokes behind Davis Riley, the 54-hole leader. Riley had converted one of his previous two 54-hole leads on the PGA Tour and looked comfortable in the position early with two birdies in his first five holes.However, just as Riley appeared to be settling into his own, a rough three-hole stretch saw him pencil bogey, bogey, double bogey onto his scorecard. The door flew wide open, and Gotterup stepped through.\nThe big-hitting right-hander overpowered the classic Seth Raynor design, chopping off doglegs and taking egregious lines off the tee, doing so without sacrificing any semblance of accuracy. Four front-nine birdies saw him capture the lead by himself before he took full control of the tournament in the middle of his back nine.\nFor all his power off the tee, Gotterup got going thanks to his touch on the greens. He dialed up birdie connections from 21 feet on No. 12, 26 feet on No. 13 and 12 feet on No. 17 to put the tournament on ice just as Gerard was beginning to breathe down his neck.With only the par-5 finisher remaining, Gotterup flighted another beauty into the middle of the fairway. A layup, a wedge to the middle of the green and two putts were all that remained as Gotterup stepped up to the challenge and in doing so may have stepped up in class. Grade: A+\nHere are some of the other notable finishes on the 2026 Sony Open leaderboard.T4. Robert MacIntyre (-12): MacIntyre entered the week as the third-highest-ranked player in the field, and he looked the part on Sunday. The world No. 8 fired a final-round 63 -- the lowest of the day -- that included five front-nine birdies and zero dropped shots. MacIntyre was finally able to combine his approach play and putting and noted his frustrations on the greens earlier in the week had boiled over so much that he snapped his putter on Friday. There was none of that over the weekend as he started his season on a high note.\"This is one of my favorite golf tournaments of the year, to be honest,\" MacIntyre said. \"This is one of the best golf courses we play all year. Any one of the guys out there can play this golf course on their day. You don't have to bomb it. You can be short. It's just a proper test of golf, more like what we would play in Europe when we go to Valderrama, Belgium. You got to shape the ball. Obviously, the breeze gets up, but yeah, this is a great start. A lot more to come. \"But always a massive reminder of attitude has to be spot on. Last year, I felt like I done a great job of that. Yeah, I think expectations first two rounds have kind of affected me with that, but yeah, starting to manage it better. Obviously nice when you're playing well. It's easier to manage. Something I really got to switch on for the rest of the year.\" Grade: A-\nT13. Hideki Matsuyama (-9): The former tournament champion snuck his way into the weekend thanks to some late-round heroics on Friday and parlayed that into a strong Moving Day. Matsuyama was sensational from tee to green on Saturday in particular, carding a third-round 65 that featured seven birdies and just about nothing made on the greens. Matsuyama pushed it as deep as 9 under through his first five holes in the final round, but two bogeys and no birdies across his next 11 holes put any chance of a Sunday surge to bed. Grade: BT24. Jordan Spieth (-7): There were plenty of positive signs for those in the Spieth camp as he opened with two straight 68s before a Sunday 69. At various points of the tournament, he flashed in all areas of the game, but he just seemed allergic to momentum. Every time he took one step forward, he took one step back and was never able to create a snowball effect of rolling one quality hole into another. That could stem from multiple areas, but close-range putting is a place to start. \"I thought I kicked some rust off,\" Spieth said. \"I thought it was better than a month ago. Certainly, a lot of positives to go off. Historically, I've had a really hard time on these greens; that continued this week. But I'll go into some more familiar ones coming up the next few events. I got either a week or two weeks, depending on when I play next, to kind of trim the fat a little bit and get tighter and more consistent. \n\"But I was very happy with the control of the ball, especially in the conditions. Then today was a day-to-day take advantage and got off to a nice start, and unfortunately, was a just little off today with the striking and with the putting. Days like that happen. You kind of hope they happen on Monday and not on Sunday. It was a little bit of an off day, but all in all, coming into the week, I felt pretty confident about where things were at, so I would've liked to maybe finish higher. It was a nice finish, birdieing the last couple and feeling like I can take some momentum into the beginning of the season and hopefully get on a nice little run.\" Grade: C+\nT40. Vijay Singh (-5): Amid outside criticism for using his career money list exemption this season, the soon-to-be 63-year-old beat players like Brian Harman, Tom Kim, Collin Morikawa and Keegan Bradley in his first non-major start on the PGA Tour since the 2021 Honda Classic. Spanning even further back, the finish represents Singh's first made cut on the PGA Tour since the 2020 Memorial. It is unknown just how much the three-time major champion will play on the PGA Tour this season (he is not in next week's field at The American Express), but so far so good through the first week. Grade: CMC. Collin Morikawa: On a golf course that was perfect for him on paper, Morikawa penned an underwhelming two-round performance. The two-time major champion struggled with his swing in the calm conditions Thursday morning and watched as his putting problems persisted into Friday afternoon. Morikawa had a chance late in the second round to recover from his opening 72 and make the cut, but a couple of misses from short range across his final three holes were the final nails in his coffin.

    "body": "\n        And then there were four. The NFC and AFC Championship representatives have been determined, and the winners of those two games will square off in Super Bowl LX.Just three games remain that will impact where each team picks in the 2026 NFL Draft. The final missing piece in determining the complete order for all seven rounds will be the announcement of compensatory selections, which came on the second Tuesday in March last year.As a reminder, four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- do not own a first-round pick in 2026 due to draft-day trades, including the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals.Here is the current 2026 NFL Draft order:1. Las Vegas Raiders (3-14)Las Vegas over-extended last offseason by drafting a running back in the top-10 and trading for a 35-year-old quarterback despite having one of the league's worst rosters. As a result, they fired head coach Pete Carroll after one season and are now picking even earlier in the draft. \n2. New York Jets (3-14)The Jets finished with one of the worst records in the league, but at least they have a plan and put themselves in a position to change the course of their franchise. Over the next two years, New York has five first-round picks. 3. Arizona Cardinals (3-14)Arizona made the decision to part with head coach Jonathan Gannon. It would not be a surprise if they moved on from Kyler Murray as well. The problem is that there are not a wealth of options to replace Murray.4. Tennessee Titans (3-14)The positive momentum Tennessee had built over the past month came to a frustrating end in the season finale. Still, Cam Ward's strong finish to the 2025 campaign should give Titans fans hope.\n5. New York Giants (4-13)There are reasons to be optimistic about Jaxson Dart's future with the franchise. He brought life to an offense that could have easily wallowed in self-pity following the Malik Nabers and Andrew Thomas injuries. If they get the head coach hire right, then maybe the a bounce back will happen sooner than most would expect.   6. Cleveland Browns (5-12)The Browns made the decision to part with head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons. He did lead the franchise to its first playoff win post-expansion, but may not be any closer to identifying the quarterback of the future. 7. Washington Commanders (5-12)Next season is an easy sell for Washington. If Jayden Daniels returns healthy, then they will be competitive once again, but there are a lot of needs on that roster. An attempt to microwave those weaknesses last offseason did not work out. \n8. New Orleans Saints (6-11)The Saints' season ended just as fans were clamoring for more of Tyler Shough. He looks like the clear favorite to open next season as the starting quarterback, bringing a level of optimism that simply didn't exist earlier in the year.9. Kansas City Chiefs (6-11)Kansas City will enter next season in unfamiliar territory: the hungry underdog. Assuming Patrick Mahomes' full health, there is no reason to believe the Chiefs will not be in the mix again next season. They do have a deteriorating roster that desperately needs a youthful infusion. 10. Cincinnati Bengals (6-11)Joe Burrow made a notable attempt to get the Bengals into the playoffs after succumbing to an injury early in the season, but ultimately fell short. The offense will be in a spot to compete next season, but can the defense improve enough this offseason to get them enough stops?\n\n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 5.0: Dante Moore's decision shakes up Round 1, forcing Jets to pivot at No. 2\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n11. Miami Dolphins (7-10)Fans can say what they want about the Mike McDaniel era in Miami, but few had such a recognizable aesthetic as the Dolphins' former coach. It is a fresh start for the organization with a new general manager, new head coach and presumably a new quarterback.12. Dallas Cowboys (7-9-1)Dallas is once again searching for answers this offseason. Dak Prescott was healthy and the team still failed to reach the playoffs with a new head coach. 13. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (8-9)Atlanta fired Raheem Morris as head coach for a second time. They sent their first round pick to Los Angeles as part of the trade up for James Pearce Jr. \n14. Baltimore Ravens (8-9)For the first time since 2007, the Ravens will have a new head coach after firing John Harbaugh. It sounds as though the franchise chose Lamar Jackson -- who turned 29-years-old one day after Harbaugh's firing -- over the veteran coach. 15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9)Other organizations have been quick to make a head coaching change, but the Buccaneers are going down the path of firing coordinators rather than a change at the top. 16. New York Jets via Indianapolis Colts (8-9)Cornerback Sauce Gardner struggled to stay healthy and the Colts' pick being sent to New York rose precipitously by the week. \n17. Detroit Lions (9-8)The coaching drain that took place after last season's run was likely understated in the moment given the presence Dan Campbell has over that organization, but that, along with a few veteran offensive line departures, led to a much more tumultuous season.18. Minnesota Vikings (9-8)J.J. McCarthy's season was volatile, which was once the expectation for a young quarterback. Recent rookie performances from Jayden Daniels and C.J. Stroud set unrealistic expectations for the majority. Caleb Williams is proof that situation matters. 19. Carolina Panthers (8-9)The team with the worst record in the NFL Playoffs, but also a home game, was the first punted from the postseason. Although not a desirable conclusion, the Panthers have to be pleased with how the season played out. \n20. Dallas Cowboys via Green Bay Packers (9-7-1)The team with the second worst record in the NFL Playoffs was also dispatched after building a 21-3 lead over the division rival Bears. It is going to be an interesting offseason for the Packers. 21. Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7)The Steelers couldn't do anything against an elite Texans defense as the team suffered its seventh straight playoff loss.22. Los Angeles Chargers (11-6)The Chargers are headed home for the season after falling to the Patriots in the wild card round.\n23. Philadelphia Eagles (11-6)A frustrating season, for fans and receivers alike, came to an end Sunday against the 49ers. The Eagles will be doing some soul searching this offseason. 24. Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (13-4)The Jaguars have every reason to celebrate their accomplishments this season. Yes, they lost in the wild card round as the home team, but a year ago, they were making preparations for the No. 5 overall pick. The future is bright for a team who played most of this season without No. 2 overall selection Travis Hunter.25. Chicago Bears (11-6)The Bears forced overtime on yet another miraculous, game-tying throw by Caleb Williams, but the last of his three interceptions proved costly, setting up the Rams' game-winning field goal in the divisional round.\n26. Buffalo Bills (12-5)The stage was set for Josh Allen to excel in a playoff setting that excluded the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson, but it ended the same as every other year -- in heartbreak.27. San Francisco 49ers (12-5)San Francisco's divisional round game against the Seahawks was never in question. The Seahawks scored the game's first 17 points, and the 49ers were outscored 17-0 in the second half as well. The franchise has big questions to answer this offseason.28. Houston Texans (12-5)C.J. Stroud completed four passes to the opposition Sunday afternoon, which left the margins for victory very slim. Despite those issues, Houston maintained striking distance for most of the game, but the Patriots pulled away late. 29. Los Angeles Rams (12-5)Chicago's snow slowed Matthew Stafford and the high-flying Rams offense, but they did enough in overtime to survive the Bears and advance to the NFC Championship Game.30. New England Patriots (14-3)Drake Maye was not immune to his own turnover tendencies. He threw an interception and lost two of his four fumbles. However, the stage is set for them to advance to the Super Bowl given Denver will be playing a backup at quarterback next week. 31. Denver Broncos (14-3)Denver suffered the rare win that feels like a loss. It was learned after the game that Bo Nix had broken his ankle and would miss the AFC Championship. 32. Seattle Seahawks (14-3)Seattle returns to the NFC Championship game for the first time since 2014 after drubbing the 49ers on Saturday night.The 2026 NFL Draft will take place April 23–25 in Pittsburgh.

Plenty of the betting action will center on the spread, money line and over/under, but bettors are also always looking to push the envelope to put together huge parlays. The Rams vs. Bears matchup has the highest over/under (48.5) despite frigid temps and heavy winds expected, so many will look at the alternate total in that contest.From NFL player props to alternate lines to exact score predictions, there are several plus-money NFL bets one could pursue in their playoff parlay for a shot at a massive return.

SportsLine's model has him scoring 36% of the time on Sunday, making it a great value at these odds. See the rest of the picks in the divisional round NFL parlay here, and you can bet Parkinson as an anytime TD scorer using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make NFL parlay picks for a payout of $1.2 millionThe parlay also includes several additional picks from the divisional round Sunday from SportsLine's computer model, including multiple touchdown props that returns +600 or higher. You can only see the picks and the full parlay at SportsLine.What are the top NFL picks for the divisional round that can be combined into a parlay that returns $1.2 million on just a $10 bet, and what optimal touchdown scorer bets should you be all over?

    "body": "\nThe fifth-seeded Houston Texans will look to extend their winning streak to 10 games when they battle the second-seeded New England Patriots in a 2026 NFL divisional round matchup on Sunday. Houston advanced with a 30-6 win at Pittsburgh, while New England defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 16-3 in the Wild Card Round. The Texans (12-5), who finished 10-2 against AFC foes this season, have outscored their opponents by 109 points. The Patriots (14-3), who were 9-3 within the conference, have a plus-170 point differential. Houston will be without wide receiver Nico Collins (concussion). Pats CB Christian Gonzalez (concussion) is active after passing protocol.Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. Houston has won three of the last four meetings with New England. The Patriots are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Texans vs. Patriots odds, while the over-under for total points scored is 40.5.

    "body": "\nTeams coming off wild-card comebacks will meet in the 2026 NFL divisional round as the Los Angeles Rams visit the Chicago Bears on Sunday. This matchup will complete the final four teams of the 2026 NFL playoffs. L.A. (12-5) defeated Carolina, 34-31, last Saturday via a game-winning touchdown pass with 38 seconds remaining. Chicago (11-6) overcame an 18-point deficit to knock off Green Bay, 31-27, on Saturday. The teams have split their prior two postseason meetings, with the home team winning each game.

Los Angeles is the 3.5-point favorite in the latest Bears vs. Rams odds from DraftKings Sportsbook.

With that type of potency, no team has more against-the-spread victories than Los Angeles' 12 this season, while the Bears are just 2-7 ATS over their last nine divisional round playoff games. The L.A. offense sometimes overshadows the other side of the ball, which is elite in itself. No team has allowed fewer rushing scores than Los Angeles, which also finds itself in the top 10 in interceptions, sacks and passer rating allowed. That defense contrasts with what Chicago offers as the Bears rank 29th in total defense and allowed 6.0 yards per play in the regular season, which was the third-most in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Bears can coverThe Windy City has certainly provided a home-field advantage for the Bears who are 8-2 both straight-up and ATS over their last 10 home games versus the Rams. This season, the team is 11-4-1 ATS over its last 16 games, while the Rams are the only team playing this weekend that lost versus the spread in the Wild Card Round. The Rams have lost against the line in three of their last four road games, and Chicago's highly efficient offense can exploit Los Angeles' suddenly leaky defense. No team has committed fewer turnovers than the Bears, who also possess top-10 rankings in both points scored and yards gained. Meanwhile, the Rams have given up an average of 30 points over their last five contests and have allowed multiple passing touchdowns in five of their last seven games. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Bears     picksSportsLine's model has simulated Bears vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 52 combined points.

The Bears outscored Green Bay 25-6 in the fourth quarter to erase a three-score halftime deficit. Williams shook off two interceptions and finished with two touchdown passes and 361 passing yards, including some clutch fourth-quarter passes that got Chicago back in the game. While the Bears have some deficiencies on defense, they boast a top-10 scoring offense as Williams has spread the ball around to DJ Moore, Rome Odunze, Colston Loveland, Luther Burden III and others. They are getting more than a field goal at home this week against a Rams squad that was shaky at Carolina this week, giving them a great chance to cover. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Rams can coverDespite failing to cover in the wild-card round, Los Angeles has been one of the best NFL teams against the spread this season. The Rams are 12-6 ATS overall and 11-5 ATS as the favorites. Stafford leads the league's best scoring offense as the Rams are the only team in the NFL that averages more than 30 points per game. They also have a top-10 scoring defense, giving up just 20.9 points per game. Stafford has been in the MVP conversation this season, and he has an extremely strong supporting cast. Running backs Kyren Williams and Blake Corum have combined for nearly 2,000 rushing yards, while receiver Puka Nacua led the NFL in receptions (129) in the regular season and ranked second in receiving yards (1,715).

There are only two undefeated teams remaining, UConn and Vanderbilt, and both will be put to the test against some tough opponents.The Coretta Scott King Classic in New Jersey will feature Michigan against Vanderbilt, as well as another AP Top 25 matchup with Ohio State taking on TCU. Meanwhile, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish are heading to Connecticut to see if can challenge the reigning national champions. Here is a closer look at the top three games to watch on Monday.No. 14 Ohio State vs. No. 10 TCU12 p.m. ET on FOXAfter they lost a close game to UCLA on Dec. 28, the Buckeyes have been on a five-game winning streak that includes quality victories over Illinois and Maryland. They are also fresh off a 108-84 victory against Penn State in which they tied their single-game program record with 17 made three-pointers. Even if they don't shoot the ball like that against TCU, they have momentum on their side right now. TCU had an upset scare against West Virginia on Jan. 14, and bounced back with a 78-62 victory against Arizona. However, the Horned Frogs have been struggling with turnovers recently, which was on full display against Arizona with 17 of them. Pick: Ohio State. No. 8 Michigan vs. No. 5 Vanderbilt2:30 p.m. ET on FOXAs I mentioned in our expert predictions, I think this could be Vanderbilt's first loss of the season. Michigan has multiple scoring threats and has had several convincing victories, including a 39-point win against Notre Dame. The Wolverines also almost pulled off an upset against No. 1 UConn in November. The Commodores are still undefeated but not unbeatable as they almost suffered their first loss at the hands of Mississippi State on Jan. 14. Michigan's guard play should provide a tough challenge for Vanderbilt, and this might come down to how well the Wolverines can defend Mikayla Blakes, one of the nation's leading scorers. Pick: Michigan.\nNo. 23 Notre Dame vs. No. 1 UConn5 p.m. ET FOXThe Fighting Irish are in the middle of a rebuilding season and have gone through some rough patches. They briefly left the AP Top 25 but returned after a 23-point win over North Carolina behind a 31-point performance by Hannah Hidalgo and a double-double from Cassandre Prosper. This team has potential but they are still working on more players consistently stepping up. They are fresh off a 79-66 loss to No. 9 Louisville, and this will be a tough game to bounce back with. UConn is led by Sarah Strong and Azzi Fudd, but the roster is a lot deeper than them. The Huskies are strong on both sides of the court which doesn't leave a lot of room for mistakes. Pick: UConn.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        No. 2 South Carolina played at Coppin State on Sunday, an unusual sight since high-majors don't typically play HBCUs on the road. It all started with a tweet from Gamecocks coach Dawn Staley while trying to finish her 2024-25 schedule.\"Really sorry I have to resort to this but-we need a game,\" Staley wrote in August 2024. \"I've had some nice, funny and outlandish convos regarding scheduling a game H/H with a guarantee and guaranteed a great student-athlete experience -any interest please let me know. Need to finish this schedule.\"A few days later, Staley gave an update saying the Gamecocks' schedule had been completed and gave a shoutout to HBCUs. Although she didn't reveal it was Coppin State at the time, South Carolina hosted the Eagles on Nov. 14, 2024.\nThis Sunday, it was time for the Gamecocks to travel to Baltimore. South Carolina picked up a 90-48 victory, but the lopsided result doesn't take away from how beneficial scheduling a game like this can be for HBCUs. Staley made the deal with coach Jermaine Woods, but it was honored by first-year head coach Darrel Mosley.\"It's a big revenue (draw) for HBCUs\" Mosley said to Greenville News ahead of the matchup. \"We're not well-funded so drawing ticket sales at the door. A regular game we have 200 people in the building, just (Staley) coming to play it's going to probably be roughly 4,000 people. The university is able to capitalize on that revenue.\"\nOther than helping a roster build confidence early in the season, there are not too many benefits for top-ranked opponents to travel for a game against mid or low-major teams. There are costs involved in traveling and losing that game could be a huge hit on their resume.Regardless, Staley talked about the importance of shining some light on HBCUs. During Sunday's postgame press conference, she said the crowd of 3,371 was the second highest attendance in Coppin State history, only trailing the game against LSU on Dec. 2023 when Maryland native Angel Reese was on the Tigers' roster.Despite this being a road game for the Gamecocks, there was a lot of appreciation for South Carolina, with fans even lining up to take pictures with Staley.\n\"Scheduling is hard...Instead of the big competitive games, we've added some HBCUs just to lift up every aspect of our sport,\" Staley said in September. \"Not every team will play an HBCU on their home court. And we feel like, you know, it's a great game, great competition, great coaching. If we can lift because we play the game and get some notoriety to some HBCUs, then we'll do that.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Golden Knights have a penchant for making waves on the trade market, and it appears as if they have set another in motion Sunday night. Las Vegas has acquired veteran defenseman Rasmus Andersson from the Calgary Flames, dished out a nice return to secure the deal, according to Elliotte Friedman of SportsnetAs part of the Golden Knights' acquisition, the Flames have agreed to retain 50% of Andersson's $4.55 million contract. Las Vegas is sending back to Calgary a first-round pick in the 2027 NHL Draft, a conditional 2027 second-round pick, defenseman Zach Whitecloud and defensive prospect Abram Weibe.If the Golden Knights win the Stanley Cup this season, the second-round pick will become a future first-round selection, per Friedman.With Alex Pietrangelo out for the season due to a serious hip injury, the Golden Knights had a void in their top four. They've now filled that gap with one of the best options on the trade market.\nThe compensation sent over by Las Vegas is particularly significant considering Andersson is playing on the final year of his current contract and the deal did not include agreement on a contract extension. The Golden Knights have consequently surrendered premium future assets for a rental player. An extension could be announced anytime over the next few months, of course, but it's still a gamble on the part of general manager Kelly McCrimmon, who hasn't shied away from bold moves in the past.The question now is whether Andersson was the right player on whom to gamble. There was a time when he was considered an underrated star on the back end, particularly when Darryl Sutter was behind the Flames' bench from 2020-23. Andersson posted solid five-on-five numbers, including a plus-31 goal differential, while also tallying 120 points in 217 games, per Natural Stat Trick.However, since Ryan Huska took over in 2023-24, Andersson's numbers have tumbled. Part of that has to do with Sutter taking his elite defensive system with him when he left, and another part of it is the overall deterioration of the roster.\nStill, the underlying metrics haven't been kind to Andersson recently.With Huska leading the Flames, Andersson has a 48.1% expected goals share and a minus-24 goal differential at five-on-five. His offensive production has also taken a slight step back, too, with 100 points in 207 games.The Golden Knights will try to get Andersson back into a strong defensive environment where shortcomings can be concealed while allowing him to showcase his offensive skillset. If they can get Andersson back to his 2022-23 form, no one will care about the acquisition cost.As for the Flames, they're a team clearly in rebuild mode, and it seemed unlikely that Andersson would re-sign next summer. Securing a first-round pick (as well as a conditional second-round pick) without a sign-and-trade was probably fair value in this instance. Whitecloud is a solid depth defenseman, and Weibe is more of a long-term project.\nThis is a classic example of a trade that made plenty of sense for both sides. The Flames can load up on draft capital as they try to kickstart a rebuild, and the Golden Knights are focused on winning now as they gear up for what should be a gauntlet in the Western Conference playoffs.Las Vegas currently has the second-best odds to win the West at +470, according to FanDuel; however, the Colorado Avalanche (+125) are the clear favorites, and the Edmonton Oilers (+500) aren't far behind.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        At long last, DJ Lagway has made a decision regarding his plans for the upcoming football season. The former Florida Gators' sophomore quarterback is signing with Baylor 10 days after he had committed to them. A former five-star recruit, the 6-foot-3, 247-pound Lagway entered the transfer portal on Dec. 15 following two seasons at Florida. He had early visits with Florida State and Virginia before visiting Ole Miss after Trinidad Chambliss was denied a sixth season of eligibility. There were also rumblings that Duke could be in the mix for Lagway's services after Darian Mensah entered the transfer portal at the 11th hour. In the end, though, the 20-year-old Lagway has decided to sign with Baylor while following in the footsteps of his father, Derek, who played running back for the Bears from 1997-01. While he showed flashes of his potential at Florida, injuries prevented Lagway from having more success during his time with the Gators. Multiple injuries, for example, prevented him from taking part in Florida's spring practices ahead of the 2025 season. A calf issue that was sustained in July further hindered his practice availability. Those injuries and the subsequent loss of practice time undoubtedly impacted Lagway's effectiveness once the 2025 season began. He and the Gators endured a 1-3 start to the season that included a 20-10 loss to LSU that saw Lagway throw a season-high five interceptions. \nLagway finished the season with 2,264 yards and 16 touchdowns while completing 63.2% of his passes. He also threw an SEC-high 14 picks for the Gators, who finished the season with a 4-8 record. Lagway showed his potential at the end of the 2024 season by leading the Gators to four straight wins that included throwing for a season-high 305 yards in a 33-8 win over Tulane in the Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl. He also led the Gators' to wins over then-ranked LSU and Ole Miss before Florida defeated rival Florida State in their regular season finale. A former USA Today Offensive Player of the Year, Lagway was named Mr. Texas Football in 2023 after throwing for 4,631 yards and a Texas 6A record 58 touchdown passes during his senior season. He also ran for 975 yards and 15 touchdowns while showcasing his impressive versatility. \nLagway will be going to a Baylor team that went 5-7 last season and 3-6 in the Big 12. Despite last year's struggles, the school decided to retain coach Dave Aranda, who went 36-37 during his first six seasons with the Bears. His best season with the Bears took place back in 2021, when he lead Baylor to a 12-2 record that was capped off by Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        It was a wild ride to get there, but Senegal have won the Africa Cup of Nations, defeating hosts Morocco 1-0 after a stoppage-time golazo from Pape Gueye on Sunday. His unbalanced shot was well placed to best Yassine Bounou in the net, but this is a game that would not have been won without the leadership of Sadio Mane, who rallied the Senegal side after Morocco were awarded a penalty deep into stoppage time.Here is the winning goal:\nWhen Morocco were awarded a penalty due to Malick Diouf's challenge on Brahim Diaz, the match devolved into madness. Senegalese players went down the tunnel and left the pitch due to frustration. They had a goal ruled out in the second half for a foul on Achraf Hakimi before Morocco's penalty was given after a VAR review, heightening the frustration that the players were feeling. Mane pleaded with the players to return to the pitch before needing to go into the locker room to retrieve the remainder of the Senegal team, which resulted in a stoppage of play of around 18 minutes before the penalty could be taken. When things resumed, Youssef En-Nesyri handed the ball to Diaz with a chance to potentially win the game. It wasn't to be as he attempted a Panenka that Edouard Mendy had no issues saving in the net.\nWinning the Africa Cup of Nations final takes the ability to survive, and Senegal did just that to best Morocco in Rabat, winning AFCON for the first time since 2021. Being in the final for three of the last four AFCONs, this has been a dominant Senegalese side, and they'll look to push that success to the World Cup, where they'll be in a group with France, Norway, and one of Bolivia, Suriname, or Iraq. It won't be an easy path to escape from that group, but it also wasn't an easy path to lift AFCON for this battle-tested side. Even without their captain, Kalidou Koulibaly, who was suspended due to yellow card accumulation, the Lions of Teranga were defensively stout and able to stave off anything that came their way. Senegal only conceded one goal in their last five matches, recording a shutout in the last three.In the first half, Morocco keeper Bounou stole the show with an impressive save in a one-on-one situation with Iliman Ndiaye bearing down on his goal. It's nothing new for Bounou, who has been excellent protecting Morocco's net as he hasn't allowed a goal in four consecutive matches while leading his nation to the final. But that was a streak that Senegal would end in extra time.\nMorocco, 2022 World Cup semifinalists, grew into the match in the second half but lost momentum after a clash of heads between Senegal's Malick Diouf and Morocco's Neil El Aynaoui caused a long stoppage in play while both players received medical treatment. That took some wind out of the match that Senegal used to regain their defensive composure and push on to win with the help of Mane's leadership. For Morocco, it's the first time that they've appeared in the final since 2004, and while this is a strong team, they'll feel hard done not being able to lift the title in front of their home fans as their drought will officially reach half a century in two months.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe 2026 NFL playoffs are set with Denver and Seattle the top seeds in their respective conferences. Thus, they won't partake in the 2026 Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule but several other Super Bowl contenders are available to make Wild Card NFL bets on. Teams like the Texans and Jaguars enter in on win streaks of nine and eight games, respectively, and could be highly sought after with NFL picks. Meanwhile, Green Bay is riding a four-game losing streak and is a 1.5-point underdog to the Bears on Saturday night, per the latest Wild Card Weekend NFL odds.Those two split their regular season matchups as they'll tangle in the postseason for just the third time ever. The NFL line for that game matches Bills vs. Jaguars (+1.5) as the slimmest of the Wild Card Weekend NFL spreads, while the largest has the Rams favored by 10.5 points over the Panthers. Other spreads include 49ers vs. Eagles (-3.5), Chargers vs. Patriots (-3.5) and Steelers vs. Texans (-3.5). All of the updated Wild Card Weekend NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Wild Card Weekend NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

These teams have the same 9-8 spread record, but Pittsburgh is 4-1 ATS over its last five, while Houston has failed to cover in two of its last three. While Houston has an elite defense, it allowed its most points (30) all year in Week 18 to a Colts team with a fourth-string rookie quarterback, which is no comparison to an Aaron Rodgers-led unit getting back a rested DK Metcalf. As for C.J. Stroud, he is 0-2 on the road in his playoffs career, failing to account for a touchdown in either loss. The Steelers are forecasted to cover over 50% of the time, with the Over hitting in well over 50% of simulations. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Steelers using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nHow to make Wild Card NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Wild Card Weekend NFL schedule and just revealed three teams projected to outright win over 60% of the time, potentially giving you a huge payday.

This year's postseason won't have Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, but there will still be plenty of familiar faces. The Eagles are in the playoffs for the fifth straight season and they'll be looking to become the first NFC team in 31 years to repeat as Super Bowl champion. Jalen Hurts is one of just two quarterbacks in the playoffs this year who has won a Super Bowl along with Matthew Stafford and Aaron Rodgers. The Steelers quarterback actually has more career playoff wins than every other QB in the AFC playoff field combined. There are also plenty of new faces in the postseason this year, including six teams that didn't make the playoffs last year with the Seahawks, 49ers, Panthers, Bears, Patriots and Jaguars all getting in. The final five teams in that group all lost at least 11 games last year before rebounding to make the postseason this year. The Panthers are in playoffs for the first time since 2017 and they'll be kicking off the postseason this year by hosting the Saturday afternoon game. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top two picks as other teams miss out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams at (4) Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Packers at (2) Bears, 8 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime)Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) (Stream on Paramount+)(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots, 8 p.m. ET (NBC)Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans at (4) Steelers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 4:30 p.m. ET AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 8 p.m. ETSunday, Jan. 18AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 3 p.m. ETAFC or NFC divisional matchup, 6:30 p.m. ETNote: The winner of the Monday night game in the wild card round will play on Sunday in the divisional round.

    "body": "\n        The end of the regular season doesn't just close the book on another year in the NFL. For some franchises, it also coincides with a reevaluation of the entire organization, which can result in various firings. While some clubs made changes midseason, the more common time we see head coaches and GMs be let go comes the day after the regular season concludes, better known as Black Monday. Already, we've seen four teams fire their now-former head coach (Falcons, Browns, Cardinals and Raiders) and one club also rid itself of its general manager (Falcons). Pair that with the two head coaching vacancies (Giants and Titans) that were already open due to firings during the season, and quite a few jobs are opening up across the league. So, who fills them? With the Band-Aid ripped off, those teams are now beginning the process of finding their next leader. Below, we'll chronicle that pursuit by tracking the latest interview requests by each team. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Head coaches\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Arizona CardinalsPrevious head coach: Jonathan GannonAfter three seasons on the job, the Cardinals decided to move on from Jonathan Gannon. He went 15-36 as the organization's head coach, which included a 3-14 season in 2025. Arizona ended the year on a nine-game losing streak. The Cardinals have made the playoffs once in the last 10 seasons. \nInterview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsPrevious head coach: Raheem MorrisAfter two seasons on the job, the Falcons fired Morris in the aftermath of a disappointing 2025 campaign. Atlanta finished 8-9 for the second season in a row and was third in the NFC South. Interview requestsKlint Kubiak, Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator (via NFL Media)Anthony Weaver, Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator (via NFL Media)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland BrownsPrevious head coach: Kevin StefanskiCleveland moved on from Kevin Stefanski after a 5-12 season in 2025 that saw the franchise finish last in the AFC North. Stefanski coached the Browns for the last six seasons and won two Coach of the Year awards, but was 45-56 in his 101 regular-season games.  Interview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Las Vegas RaidersPrevious head coach: Pete CarrollPete Carroll proved to be one-and-done in Las Vegas after the 74-year-old was unable to lift the organization to respectability in 2025. The Raiders finished with the worst record in the NFL (3-14) and now possess the No. 1 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft. General manager John Spytek and minority owner Tom Brady are expected to spearhead the coaching search. \nInterview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York GiantsPrevious head coach: Brian DabollNew York fired Daboll midway through the 2025 season after a 2-8 start to the year. He'd been at his post since 2022 and went 20-40-1 over his tenure in the regular season. General manager Joe Schoen will remain with the organization and lead the search. Interview requestsMike Kafka -- Giants interim head coach and offensive coordinator\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Tennessee TitansPrevious head coach: Brian CallahanTennessee fired Callahan in mid-October after a 1-5 start to the season. The 41-year-old coach was hired in 2024 and went 4-19 over his tenure. Interview requestsMatt Nagy -- Chiefs offensive coordinator (via The Athletic)Vance Joseph -- Broncos defensive coordinator (via CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones)Steve Spagnuolo -- Chiefs defensive coordinator (via The Athletic)Lou Anarumo -- Colts defensive coordinator (via The Athletic)General managers\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta FalconsPrevious GM: Terry FontenotAtlanta cleaned house after the 2025 season, not only firing Raheem Morris but also parting ways with general manager Terry Fontenot. He had been with the organization in this GM role since 2021 and was able to add some intriguing skill position players like Bijan Robinson and Drake London, but was unable to get a concrete plan in place at quarterback. A clear plan at that position will likely be the main emphasis for owner Arthur Blank as he combs through candidates this time around. \nInterview requestsTo be announced.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami DolphinsPrevious GM: Chris GrierIt was a rather seismic decision by the Dolphins and Grier to mutually part ways during the 2025 season, simply due to how long his tenure had been with the organization. He started as a scout in 2000 and stayed with the franchise ever since, ascending to GM in 2016. Miami made the playoffs just three times over his 10-year stint as GM, and has been under .500 in each of the last two seasons, due to an inability to build a stable roster. Interview requestsJon-Eric Sullivan -- Packers VP of player personnel (via NFL Media)Alec Halaby -- Eagles assistant general manager (via NFL Media)Tariq Ahmad -- 49ers VP of player personnel (via NFL Media)Josh Williams -- 49ers director of scouting and football operations (via NFL Media)John McKay -- Rams assistant general manager (via NFL Media)RJ Gillen -- 49ers assistant general manager (via NFL Media)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After six seasons and two of the only three playoff appearances for this iteration of the franchise, the Cleveland Browns fired head coach Kevin Stefanski on Monday morning. Stefanski, 43, is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year and signed an extension with the team in 2024. But since then the Browns have won just eight of a possible 34 games, and the offensive-minded head coach has given up play-calling duties to two different offensive coordinators in that time.\"We appreciate all [Stefanski's hard work and dedication to our organization but our results over the last two seasons have not been satisfactory, and we believe a change at the head coaching position is necessary,\" managing and principal Partners Dee and Jimmy Haslam said in a statement. Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.The Browns will retain general manager Andrew Berry, who will embark on a search for the next head coach that sources believe will likely yield another first-time head coach. And that man could very well have Shedeur Sanders as his Week 1 quarterback next season.\nLeague sources believe Stefanski could get another head-coaching job this cycle. The coaching pool is not teeming with the sort of perceived talent as last year's crop. Stefanski could be a candidate with both the Titans and Giants.The writing had been on the wall for Stefanski for months in Cleveland as it seemed like he and leadership got off the same page. He had to operate a clunky four-person quarterback competition in the summer with Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, Dillon Gabriel and Sanders. Flacco was the clear winner and gave the team the best chance to win, but second-team reps ultimately got wasted on Pickett when he was traded before the start of the season to the Raiders for a nice fifth-round return.Flacco started four games before Stefanski turned to Gabriel, and then the Browns made the surprising move to trade the veteran to the Bengals for a fifth-round pick. What did not help Stefanski was Flacco going from a 60.3 quarterback rating in Cleveland to 91.0 rating in Zac Taylor's offense.\nIn Week 10, Stefanski handed play-calling duties over to Tommy Rees, who is well liked by owner Jimmy Haslam. It was the second straight year of Stefanski making the move after doing so with Ken Dorsey in 2024 before firing him. By the end of this season, the Browns offense ranked in the bottom-three in the league in yards and points.And then there's Sanders, who was taken in the fifth round by the team and who garnered more attention than any fifth-round rookie in recent NFL memory. He played in eight games and started in seven of them. By most metrics Sanders was the worst regular starter in the league this season.In seven starts Sanders had 1,400 pass yards, seven touchdowns to 10 interceptions, took 23 sacks and had a quarterback rating of 68.1, the lowest among qualifying quarterbacks.\n\n        \n            \n                Browns fire Kevin Stefanski: Here are five potential coaches who could replace him\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Browns will select in the top 10 of April's draft but will likely be out of the range for a quarterback like Fernando Mendoza. Sources say the Browns are preparing for Sanders to be their starter next season, hoping to build around the quarterback and get better results in Year 2.What coaching candidate the Browns will be able to attract is a big question hovering over the organization. The coach will need to believe in Sanders, as well as in the front office to deliver on offensive line and receiver acquisitions. Sources have said that a coach with options may not have the Browns high on his list.Since the Browns returned to Cleveland in 1999, the Browns will be looking for their 11th different head coach.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The grind leading up to the All-Star break has begun, bringing with it a plethora of games. This week will see 22 teams playing four times, with the remaining eight teams suiting up on three occasions. With no two-game teams, picking and choosing your roster will be an arduous task.Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: ATL, BOS, CHA, CHI, DEN, GSW, HOU, LAC, MEM, MIA, MIN, NOP, NYK, OKC, ORL, PHI, PHO, POR, SAS, TOR, UTA, WASThree Games: BKN, CLE, DAL, DET, IND, LAL, MIL, SACTwo Games: N/AHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the twelfth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Tre Jones, CHIOpponents: @BOS, @DET, MIA, DALWhile it hasn't all been smooth sailing for Jones since both Josh Giddey and Coby White went down with injuries, his role as the starting point guard seems relatively secure. In his past three appearances as a starter, Jones has averaged 12 points, 8.3 assists, and 0.7 steals. Given his body of work earlier in the season and down the stretch during the 2024-25 campaign, it's safe to assume his defensive contributions should increase moving forward. While he isn't a high-volume scorer, he is typically efficient for a point guard, only taking the shots he knows he can make. While White has been upgraded to questionable for Monday's game, there is every chance he is monitored quite closely, given this was his third calf injury of the season. With four games coming up, Jones makes for a strong starting candidate.Consider starting: Ayo Dosunmu, CHIOpponents: @BOS, @DET, MIA, DALDosunmu has also taken advantage of a favorable situation, playing at least 25 minutes in three of the past four games. Much like Jones, Dosunmu has stepped up over the past three games, averaging 15 points, 3.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and two 3-pointers. The possible return of White could have an impact on Dosunmu, although the fact that Jalen Smith is currently in the concussion protocol shouldn't be overlooked. Chicago will have to run with some small lineups, meaning Dosunmu's ability to play multiple positions should see him maintain a sizeable role for the foreseeable future.Consider sitting: Cam Thomas, BKNOpponents: ORL, LAC, @MEMThomas remains on a minutes restriction, having recently returned from a 20-game absence as a result of a hamstring injury. Given he missed a sizeable portion of last season for the same reason, it is likely the medical staff will want to monitor him closely moving forward. While his offensive production has been adequate since returning, rumblings out of Brooklyn are far from positive when it comes to his future with the team. In four appearances since getting back on the floor, Thomas has averaged 20.3 points and two 3-pointers, adding just two rebounds and two assists. His lack of peripheral numbers continues to be an issue, both in fantasy and reality. Despite the scoring upside, with only three games on the slate, Thomas on the bench might be a good look for your team.\nForwardsConsider starting: Justin Champagnie, WASOpponents: ORL, @PHI, NOP, @PHODespite continuing to come off the bench, Champagnie has been a sneaky source of value over the past two weeks. In seven games during that time, he has averaged 11 points, eight rebounds, 1.1 3-pointers, and 1.9 combined steals and blocks, good enough for top 90 value in standard leagues. Despite only playing 18 minutes in Sunday's loss to the Timberwolves, managers should view this as somewhat of an outlier, given the blowout nature of the game. He provides Washington with production all over the floor, a skill set that translates well across most fantasy formats. While not an obvious starting candidate, his floor should at least have him in the discussion for a starting spot, given the favorable schedule.Consider sitting: Naji Marshall, DALOpponents: @SAC, @UTA, @CHIIt's been another up-and-down season for Marshall, typically finding value when others are injured. Despite playing a sizeable role over the past month, Marshall has barely been a top 200 player in standard leagues. In 13 appearances during that span, he has averaged 14.9 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in 30.1 minutes per game. His value lies in his ability to get to the basket at an efficient rate. However, a lack of supporting numbers drags down his overall value, making him more of a streamer than a must-roster player. If he is hanging onto a spot on your roster, shifting him to the bench for a three-game week makes sense.Consider sitting: Ausar Thompson, DETOpponents: NYK, CHI, LACPlaying time continues to be a source of frustration when it comes to Thompson, with head coach JB Bickerstaff often limiting his minutes, for whatever reason he sees fit. This has resulted in Thompson overplaying his hand, particularly on the defensive end. In 13 games over the past month, Thompson finds himself well outside the top 200, averaging just 11.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 2.1 combined steals and blocks in 23.7 minutes per game. He has now played fewer than 25 minutes in four of the past five games, a trend that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. He remains a must-roster player, although only in specific builds. If you are one of those who has him on your roster, having him on the bench could certainly reduce your stress levels for the next seven days.\nCentersConsider starting: Sandro Mamukelashvili, TOROpponents: ATL, @CHA, @BOS, PHIThe saga that is Jakob Poeltl continues to roll on. Meanwhile, Mamukelashvili is putting together some tasty fantasy lines. In six games over the past two weeks, he has averaged 11 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.5 3-pointers, and 2.5 combined steals and blocks. What makes this even more impressive is the fact that he had a zero-point dud against the Nuggets. The eventual return of Poeltl is going to complicate matters, although even when he was healthy, Mamukelashvili was able to flirt with standard league value. Fire him up next week, but remember to keep an eye on Poeltl's availability.Consider sitting: Maxime Raynaud, SACOpponents: DAL, @GSW, HOURaynaud avoided serious injury when he went down with a knee concern during Friday's blowout loss to the Suns, a relief for fantasy managers everywhere. In fact, he was cleared to play only two days later, logging 24 minutes in Sunday's loss to the Bucks. His production of late has been nothing to write home about, averaging 11.3 points and 8.1 rebounds in seven games over the past two weeks. As a rookie center, his ceiling is relatively limited, particularly on the defensive end. He remains a viable asset simply because he is starting. However, with only three games coming up, moving him to the bench feels like a safe decision.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The final four is set in the College Football Playoff and it's not the teams most people were expecting. Here is how I rank the four teams based on their odds to win the National Championship heading into the semifinal matchups from FanDuel Sportsbook.Bet on the College Football Playoff at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets if their first bet of $5 or more wins:1. Indiana Hoosiers (+130)There was a changing of the guard in the Rose Bowl. Nick Saban and Alabama dominated the college football world for 15 years, winning six national championships over that span. Now, Curt Cignetti looks like the new Saban after the Hoosiers physically embarrassed Alabama. Cignetti is just two wins away from bringing a national championship to Indiana in just his second season. The Hoosiers are the best team left in the playoff and I don't think it's even debatable. Indiana has wins over Oregon, Ohio State and Alabama, all away from home. No other team in the country can match that resume. The Hoosiers are the deserving favorite to win the National Championship at +130 and I would make them at least 3-point favorites over the other three teams in the field. 2. Miami Hurricanes (+340)Miami is starting to remind me of last year's Ohio State squad that won the National Championship. The Buckeyes dropped a couple of games during the regular season but played their best football in the playoff. Miami's defensive line has been the best unit in the playoff. The Hurricanes held Texas A&M and Ohio State to a combined 17 points in the first two games but now gets its toughest test taking on the red-hot Trinidad Chambliss and Ole Miss' offense.  Despite being the last team in the field, the Canes are 3.5-point favorites over Ole Miss. I think the game will come down to Miami's offense. Carson Beck has done a good job of not losing the first two playoff games. The Hurricanes rushed for 328 in wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State, so Beck has been able to manage the game and avoid turnovers. Look for Miami to follow that blueprint against a Rebels' defense allowing 151 rushing yards per game this season. If you want to make a title bet right now, Miami is the best value on the board. The Canes are the one team left that can match Indiana in the trenches if the two meet for the National Championship.3. Ole Miss Rebels (+550)I put Ole Miss third because the Rebels are still being undervalued after the loss of Lane Kiffin. After crushing Tulane and upsetting Georgia, it's obvious Kiffin's departure isn't having a negative impact on the team.Remember, Ole Miss has one loss all season in a game it led most of the way at Georgia until the Bulldogs outscored the Rebels 17-0 in the fourth quarter. The Rebels also have an X-factor in Chambliss. We can talk about teams getting a first-round bye not being sharp after a long layoff, but I thought Georgia played really well. Chambliss was just the best player on the field, throwing for 362 yards and two touchdowns. Sometimes things happen in sports that just can't be explained. It would be one heck of a story if Ole Miss wins a National Championship without Kiffin. I do think Miami-Ole Miss is a pretty even game on paper and if the Rebels win, I wouldn't bet against them in the National Championship. I rate Ole Miss over Oregon because out of those two teams, I believe the Rebels have a better chance to pull the upset in the semifinals, so I see more value with them winning the title at +550. 4. Oregon Ducks (+310)Oregon played its best game of the season in the quarterfinals against Texas Tech. Before that win, the Ducks' best victory was at home over USC. Despite the dominant performance, I still have questions about Oregon moving forward and I think the Ducks are a little overvalued at +310 to win the National Championship. The Ducks get a rematch with Indiana in the semifinals. The teams met back in October with the Hoosiers winning at Oregon 30-20. The difference in that game was Indiana's defensive line. Indiana held Oregon to 20 points, 81 rushing yards and just 267 total yards. Quarterback Dante Moore struggled against the elite Indiana defense, finishing with 186 yards and two interceptions.I expect a similar outcome on Friday. Both defenses are very good, although I give the Hoosiers an edge. Indiana ranks No. 1 in stuff rate (tackles behind the line of scrimmage) and if the Ducks can't run the football here, they will be in trouble. For all the talk about Moore being the top pick in the NFL Draft, he has never put up big numbers against a top defense. I trust Fernando Mendoza more to make plays late if the game is close. I would make Miami a slight favorite over Oregon in the title game. If it were Ole Miss, I would make the line close to pick. Considering the Ducks have the toughest semifinals matchup, I don't like them being the second favorite to win the National Championship at +310.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Pittsburgh Steelers are getting a significant player back ahead of next week's wild card playoff showdown against the Houston Texans. Receiver DK Metcalf has been reinstated following his two-game suspension stemming from his altercation with a Lions fan during Pittsburgh's Week 16 win over Detroit. Metcalf was back inside the Steelers' facility hours after their thrilling win over the Ravens that clinched the AFC North division title for Pittsburgh. While he said he was surprised that his suspension was upheld following his appeal, Metcalf declined to discuss what transpired between himself and the Lions fan. \"I can't walk ya'll through nothing that happened,\" Metcalf said. \"I can't say nothing about what happened. ... I'm excited to be back in the building, around my teammates, being at meetings, going to practice, all the things that encompass a week of preparation.\" A two-time Pro Bowler, the 6-foot-4, 229-pound Metcalf was Pittsburgh's leading receiver during his first season with the Steelers. He caught at least three passes in all but one of his 15 regular season games and had a season-high seven catches for 148 yards during the Steelers' Week 14 win over the Ravens that sparked a three-game winning streak. \nIn their first game without Metcalf, the Steelers' offense scored just six points in their Week 17 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Pittsburgh's offense then scored just three points during the first half against the Ravens on Sunday night. Pittsburgh's offense finally got on track in the second half, scoring 23 points that included Aaron Rodgers' game-winning touchdown pass to Calvin Austin III with 55 seconds left. The Steelers' offense then watched as Ravens kicker Tyler Loop missed his game-winning, 44-yard field goal try as time expired. Along with Austin, the Steelers' offense received several other big games from their skill players. Running back Jaylen Warren had 99 all-purpose yards, while fellow running back and team MVP Kenneth Gainwell caught a team-high eight passes for 64 yards. Tight end Pat Freiermuth and veteran wideouts Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling combined to catch 11 passes for 128 yards. \nMetcalf said that he has a \"roller coaster\" of emotions watching Sunday night's game. \"I couldn't watch some moments because of my anxiety, but just happy my teammates got the dub,\" he said. Metcalf's return should be a huge boost for a Pittsburgh offense that will have its work cut out for it against a Texans defense that was No. 2 in the NFL in points allowed during the regular season. Houston's defense is led by its ferocious pass rush that is anchored by Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr., who combined to sack opposing quarterbacks 27 times during the regular season. The Texans also possess an opportunistic pass defense as four different players picked off four passes during the season. \nPittsburgh is trying to win its first playoff game since 2016, when they recorded an 18-16 win over the Chiefs in the AFC divisional round. The Steelers received six field goals that night from Chris Boswell, who along with Cameron Heyward are the only-remaining players left from Pittsburgh's most recent playoff-winning team. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders fired coach Pete Carroll after a disastrous 3-14 first season this week. Owner Mark Davis kept general manager John Spytek on board, and he and minority owner Tom Brady are expected to lead football operations in the search for the team's next coach.With the Raiders locked in for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, there's a chance for Las Vegas to take Heisman Trophy winning QB Fernando Mendoza out of Indiana. It would also present an interesting consideration in the search for a coach.\n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top two picks as other teams miss out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLas Vegas needs a culture change. Would it consider bringing in college football's ruler of the roost -- Indiana coach Curt Cignetti, to pair with his QB? The Raiders will be on their sixth head coach since 2021 and have only made the playoffs once over the last eight years -- so yes, there's nowhere to go but up after a series of failed front-office decisions.The 64-year-old Cignetti -- 10 years younger than Carroll -- has never worked in the NFL and has only two seasons of experience leading a program at the Power conference level. However, his stock's never going to be higher than it is in this very moment with the Hoosiers one win away from reaching the national championship game for the first time in school history.\nHis name has not been tied to any of the NFL's current vacancies, which include the Tennessee Titans, New York Giants, Cleveland Browns and Raiders, as of Monday morning. Looking at the current list of potential head-coaching hires this cycles who aren't retreads further, Cignetti would be just as much a calculated risk as many others without head-coaching experience with a longer career resume and pattern of winning.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.At Indiana, where he's 25-2 overall, Cignetti has done it his way through player development and talent acquisition, running off 14 straight wins for the nation's unbeaten and top-ranked team with a roster rated outside of the top-70 nationally, per the 247Sports Team Talent Composite.Cignetti's on an 8-year contract with an annual $11.6 million salary that runs through the end of the 2033 regular season at Indiana, but those figures are about to increase thanks to the Hoosiers' Rose Bowl win over Alabama triggering a \"good market faith review\" clause in his deal.\nIndiana will be required to renegotiate his current deal to be greater than or equal to the nation's third highest-paid coach (around $13 million) and if not, Cignetti's current buyout of $15 million is negated if he takes another job in 2026.Would Cignetti make the NFL jump?It's unlikely Cignetti would leave an elite program he has built at Indiana in short order for the unknown of the pro ranks, especially after acknowledging earlier this season his love for the program. And he's certainly not going to be interested in entertaining NFL opportunities -- should they arise -- amid the Hoosiers' final steps of the playoff this month.After signing an extension in October with the Hoosiers after the Penn State job opened, Cignetti said he could see himself being at the Big Ten school for many, many years. Would that mindset shift if Indiana beats Oregon in the playoff semifinals then finishes the deal with a national title on Jan. 19 in Miami?\nThat's hard to say.\"We've accomplished a lot here in a short amount of time and still have a lot of work to do,\" Cignetti said earlier this season. \"I couldn't be more proud to be a Hoosier and I plan on retiring as a Hooiser. The way this state has embraced us and our success in football has meant more to me than anything else, I just wanted to get on camera and let you know, Curt Cignetti is going to work daily to make Indiana they best they can be.\"Cignetti, whose compensation rivals the highest-paid in college football, is not jumping to the NFL for a paycut and there would be risk involved with pushing that many resources in his direction from Raiders owner Mark Davis. He would also need to provide Cignetti with full control of team operations -- from personnel decisions to coaching hires -- to ensure a potential sale pitch would be convincing.While its extent is unknown along with his influence on Davis outside of leading coaching search efforts, Brady's role within the organization is expected to increase this offseason. That's significant considering the Raiders are expected to use their top pick on a quarterback.\nIronically, Cignetti told CBS Sports earlier this season what impressed him most about Mendoza during his recruitment out the portal from California was his willingness to improve. He even name-dropped Brady, too.\"I've never been around a guy ... he wants to be great at a young age,\" Cignetti said. \"He told his dad he wanted to be the next Tom Brady. If there were 25 hours in the day, he'd spend all 25 preparing to be great… he's a special guy.\"The chance to draft his top player from the Hoosiers and build around him in Las Vegas could persuade Cignetti to toss his name in that, again, if there's mutual interest.\nRecent history of college coaches who went proSteve Spurrier, Nick Saban, Chip Kelly and Matt Rhule all won big at the college level as culture-changers of sorts in varying degrees and quickly realized the leap to the NFL was not going to work. Spurrier became the NFL highest-paid coach at the time in 2001 with the Washington Redskins after a storied 12-year tenure at Florida, but resigned in 2003 after consecutive losing seasons.Saban left LSU after winning a national championship for the Miami Dolphins in 2004, but later admitted he accepted a \"no-win situation\" after failing before assuming the lead role at Alabama a few years later.\nKelly banked off success at Oregon to join the NFL ranks in 2013 with the Philadelphia Eagles before his firing in December 2015 prior to his team's final regular-season game. His subsequent stint with the San Francisco 49ers didn't last either, along with his failed one season this fall as the Raiders' OC.Rhule's story was similar. The Carolina Panthers thought he could reverse franchise fortunes ahead of the 2020 season after success at Temple and Baylor, but it didn't happen. He went 11-27 in Carolina, received a $40 million buyout, and is now at Nebraska.Jim Harbaugh has made two successful jumps from the college to the NFL (with a jump from the NFL to college in between) and he belongs to a singular category of success all by himself. \nCignetti's won everywhere he has been and is on the cusp of becoming one of only four active coaches in college football with a national championship ring with two more wins. He may not want to tarnish a legacy, that's only going to be heightened in the coming years of the NIL and revenue share-driven era with the Hoosiers, who are already off to a hot start in the 2026 transfer portal. If there's a time for Cignetti to jump, though, it may be on the heels of the best season in school history and with a chance to lead one of the NFL's marquee franchises, and with his hand-picked QB. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Miami Hurricanes were slotted at No. 18 when the College Football Playoff Selection Committee revealed its first set of rankings on Nov. 4, setting up a daunting path for the two-loss team from the ACC to make the CFP. But Miami stayed focused on each opponent, and after stacking wins and slowly climbing up the rankings, Mario Cristobal's team received the final at-large bid to the 2025-26 CFP field, checking in at the No. 10 spot in the committee's final rankings. Merely making the bracket meant Miami made school history with its first-ever College Football Playoff appearance, but after two rounds of play, the expectations have been adjusted dramatically. This is not a Miami team that's just happy to be contending for titles -- this is a group that can fulfill the wildest hopes of Cristobal's hire and win the school's first national championship since 2002. And while such a suggestion might have been considered lunacy back when those first rankings were released on Nov. 4, it's undeniable now that Miami has arguably a good shot at winning it all. The Hurricanes are the betting favorite in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Fiesta Bowl against Ole Miss, and oddsmakers at FanDuel Sportsbook have Miami listed at +340 to win it all, third on the board just behind Indiana and Oregon.  Before we get into some of the more tangible reasons that Miami can be the last team standing this season, it's worth mentioning the ways that history and circumstance are setting up what could be a truly storybook run for a program that's packed decades of tales into college football's history. Miami, of course, has not been on stages this big with title opportunities this close since a controversial pass interference penalty against Ohio State in the BCS National Championship Game at the Fiesta Bowl in 2001-02. \nThe Hurricanes got a taste of redemption by taking out the Buckeyes in the quarterfinals, and now they can complete the cleanse with a win in Glendale in the semifinals. Winning the semifinals would also set up one of the biggest single nights in Miami football history, as the Hurricanes would then be competing for the national championship in their backyard, on their home turf, with Hard Rock Stadium set to host the title game on Jan. 19. This team has played, and won, in Blacksburg, Pittsburgh, College Station and Dallas since its last home game on No. 15. The opportunity to return home more than two months later with the game's biggest prize on the line would be an all-time moment for Miami football, and given what we've seen from this team and what's ahead, it's absolutely the expectation. So with the vibes properly addressed, let's get into the more football-specific reasons why Miami can win its next two games and claim the national championship.  More CFP predictions: Why Ole Miss can win it allBest defensive front still standing With 12 sacks in its two College Football Playoff wins, Miami has now jumped to No. 1 in the country in both sacks (46) and defensive pressures (220) while maintaining a top-10 pressure rate (40.5%) on the season. Mario Cristobal has built the identify of this team along the trenches with elite talent along both lines of scrimmage, but the wins against Texas A&M and Ohio State were notable for how the defense consistently won snaps with pressure on the quarterback on key downs but also routine run stops that prevented both opponents from getting into any kind of rhythm on offense. Texas A&M was held to just 89 rushing yards on 35 attempts (2.54 yards per attempt) in the 10-3 win in the first round, and then Ohio State managed even less with 45 yards on 24 attempts (1.88 yards per attempt). Though the Buckeyes may have wanted to be more balanced, they were forced to throw the ball 35 times to account for their struggles on the ground and the early deficit created by Miami's hot start. \nThat's the recipe for success with a group that's stacked up from end-to-end with game-changing talent. Reuben Bain has long been a leader for Miami, the home-grown blue chip star whose talent was evident from Day 1. He's backed up that talent with a relentless work ethic that shows up with his pass rush, and even when teams are dedicating extra blockers, he consistently fights his way through to get the quarterback off his mark. Of course, teams can't dedicate too much attention to Bain, because on the other side is Akheem Mesidor, who actually leads the team in sacks with 10.5 and has 3.5 sacks here in the CFP. Mesidor transferred from West Virginia prior to the 2022 season to be a part of Cristobal's first team, and now the sixth-year senior has nearly completed his goal of helping Miami get back to the promised land. In between you've got senior David Blay and junior Ahmad Moton, a pair of 300-pound defensive tackles who eat up space and press the pocket to allow those elite edge rushers to feast. Stopping teams on early downs with great run defense sets up third-and-long scenarios where Bain and Mesidor can wreck the timing for obvious passing downs. It's a tried and true way to win football games that any defense hopes to execute, but not every defense has the kind of experience and talent as Miami with the best defensive front left in the playoff. \n        \n            \n                Ranking potential College Football Playoff National Championship matchups: Miami vs. Oregon leads the way\n                \n                    Tom Fornelli                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBattle-tested resiliency  Miami has had the toughest College Football Playoff path of any of the four teams remaining, and in both of the wins, the team has found great strength in its resiliency. Playing on the road at Texas A&M, the No. 7 seed, and then against Ohio State, the No. 2 seed, in the Cotton Bowl represents the toughest road in terms of seed but also both opponents presented talent and athleticism matches for Miami's star-studded roster. While Oregon and Ole Miss started their CFP campaigns with Group of Five opponents, and Indiana got a bye to the quarterfinals, Miami has had to go into uncomfortable settings as the underdog twice and emerged victorious both times. Against the Aggies, it was the team's ability to rally from a potentially devastating fourth-quarter fumble to get the scores and stops needed to win. Then, in the upset win against Ohio State, the Hurricanes were able to stand tall and defend their early lead against every one of the Buckeyes' comeback efforts. \nThere is a great confidence that is being built by these experiences that can prove to be invaluable, and Miami's players have seen a competitive edge thanks to surviving the wars of a schedule that includes the toughest CFP path but also started with a win against Notre Dame. The Hurricanes have six wins against teams that were ranked in the top 25 at the time of the game, and with each of those victories has continued to build even more belief in their belonging as a championship team. Game-breaking athleticism on both sides of the ball With just 34 points combined in two CFP wins, Miami's offense has not exactly lit up the scoreboard so far in the postseason. But though there is an absence of production, there is not a lack of game-changing plays, as these heavyweight bouts are often determined by the one or two moments where elite athleticism rises to the surface. At this point in the playoff, the Hurricanes are not going to overwhelm any opponent with talent but the ability for that talent to break loose when the opportunity presents itself is unique with this Miami roster. It's the kind of game-breaking athleticism we see when running back Mark Fletcher breaks loose for a 56-yard run against Texas A&M to set up the only touchdown of the game for either team, or defensive back Keionte Scott jumping the route to pick off Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin and then explode 72 yards the other way for a momentum-swinging defensive touchdown. There is obvious, jump-of-the-screen athleticism with star freshman wide receiver Malachi Toney, and though he was mostly kept in check by Ohio State's defense, the commitment to stop the CBS Sports Freshman of the Year prompted more opportunities for CJ Daniels and Keelan Marion. Throw in the aforementioned pass rush duo of Reuben Bain and Akheem Mesidor, as well as some absolute transfer portal gems like safety Jakobe Thomas and linebacker Mo Toure, and what you find is a group that has been well-evaluated and well-developed to be at an athleticism advantage to no one, even on the game's biggest stages. \nMiami has routinely had players on its roster that were projected to be elite when they came out of high school, but this 2025 Hurricanes team is the group that has actually delivered results that match on-paper projection, and in many ways exceeded the expectations some of these players had coming out of high school. High-level roster building in the modern era requires both a commitment to the high school recruiting but also the ability to evaluate the transfer portal to fill in the right pieces. Mario Cristobal and his staff have hit it out of the park with this crew, blending both home-grown talent with elite athleticism out of the transfer portal to field a team that's two wins away from winning a national championship. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first week of 2026 gave the AP Top 25 poll a major shake with multiple ranked teams falling in the first few days of the new year. UConn remains at the top with 28 first-place votes, which puts the Huskies just four votes away from the first No. 1 unanimous decision of the season. Texas survived an upset scare against now-No. 18 Ole Miss on Sunday to stay at No. 2. The Longhorns are 17-0, their best start since the 1985-86 season.South Carolina stayed at No. 3 and UCLA kept its No. 4 ranking following a 34-point victory over now-No. 21 USC. Meanwhile, LSU fell from No. 5 to No. 12 after losses to Kentucky and Vanderbilt, which helped both teams enter the top 10. This is the first time a Kim Mulkey-led team has started conference play 0-2. Things won't get any easier for the Tigers as they will host Texas next weekend. As for Vanderbilt, the Commodores moved up to No. 7 after their first win over a top-five opponent since the 2008-09 season. They pulled it off thanks to a 32-point performance by Mikayla Blakes.LSU was not the only team with a shaky start to the new year. Elsewhere in the top 10, Michigan, Maryland, TCU and Iowa State suffered losses. Player of the Year candidate Audi Crooks registered a double-double of 26 points and 10 rebounds in a loss to Baylor, but it was noteworthy that Baylor figured out how to keep her scoreless in the fourth quarter. Before this game, no other team had really managed to stop Crooks. \nNotre Dame dropped out of the top 25 as Niele Ivey's six-player rotation suffered back-to-back defeats. The Fighting Irish took an overtime loss to Georgia Tech on Jan. 1 and then  a 14-point loss to Duke on Sunday even with Hannah Hidalgo flirting with a triple-double.In the Big Ten, the Iowa Hawkeyes stayed at No. 14 following an 86-76 victory over Nebraska. They join the Bruins as the only two undefeated teams in conference play, which could make their meeting in early February a very interesting one.There are only four women's college basketball teams still undefeated, UConn, Texas, Vanderbilt and Texas Tech -- whose 16-0 record is the best start in program history.\nAP Women's Basketball Top 25RankTeamRecordPointsPrev.1UConn15-0796 (28)12Texas17-0772 (4)23South Carolina15-172534UCLA14-171545Oklahoma14-165486Kentucky15-1625117Vanderbilt15-0621128Maryland15-153778Michigan11-2817610Louisville14-34851311Iowa State14-14621012LSU14-2456513TCU14-1454814Iowa12-24031415Michigan State14-12802416Baylor13-32782217Texas Tech16-02632118Ole Miss14-32431519Ohio State13-22371920Tennessee10-31622321USC10-41501722North Carolina13-41291623Washington12-21172324Princeton13-1912525Nebraska13-26520Others receiving votes: Illinois 58, Notre Dame 27, Stanford 25, NC State 22, Alabama 13, West Virginia 9, Georgia 5, Duke 3, Oklahoma St. 1.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Las Vegas Raiders' decision to hire the oldest coach in NFL history proved to be a disastrous one, and after just one year, they're starting over again. CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones is reporting that the Raiders fired Pete Carroll, 74, after he led the Raiders to a 3-14 record, its worst record as an NFL franchise. The Raiders hold the No. 1 pick in the upcoming NFL Draft.Carroll's tenure got off to a good start with the Raiders winning their season opener at the New England Patriots. But the Raiders quickly fell apart, and, after a Week 6 victory over the Tennessee Titans, Las Vegas did not win again. Their 11-game losing streak to close out the year is their longest in a single season as an NFL franchise.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.Along the way, just about every aspect went off the rails. The Raiders traded for and extended quarterback Geno Smith, who played for Carroll with the Seattle Seahawks. Smith promptly had the worst season of his career as a starter, throwing 17 interceptions to lead the NFL while No. 6 overall pick Ashton Jeanty, running behind a porous offensive line, struggled for most of the season.A breaking point arrived after a 24-10 Week 12 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Las Vegas fired offensive coordinator Chip Kelly in the aftermath, just months after making him the highest-paid coordinator in the league and just two weeks after firing special teams coordinator Tom McMahon. NFL Network reported there was a \"lack of cohesion in the coaching offices,\" with disharmony between Carroll and Kelly apparent.\nAhead of Week 17, the team shut down Pro Bowl edge defender Maxx Crosby (knee) for the season, a decision Crosby reportedly \"vehemently\" disagreed with. He now plans to evaluate his future with the franchise after signing a three-year, $106.5 million extension last offseason. The team also shut down Brock Bowers (knee), its top pass catcher, the same week.\n        \n            \n                Maxx Crosby landing spots: Cowboys, Ravens among top potential suitors for Raiders' star pass rusher\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Raiders' coaching carousel continues to spin rapidly, a trend that dates back to Jon Gruden resigning in 2021 in the wake of leaked emails in which he repeatedly used insensitive language. Las Vegas will now be looking for its sixth coach (including interims) in six seasons.Raiders coaches since 2021W-LMade playoffs?2026???2025Pete Carroll3-14No2024Antonio Pierce4-13No2023Josh McDaniels, Antonio Pierce (interim)8-9No2022Josh McDaniels6-11No2021Jon Gruden, Rich Bisaccia (interim)10-7Yes, lost wild cardAside from holding the top pick in April's draft, the Raiders have some young talent in Bowers, Jeanty and Michael Mayer, and Crosby, 28, is still in his prime -- though sorting out his future will be a crucial offseason task.\nStill, the Raiders appear in need of a substantial rebuild, something that always seemed incongruous with Carroll's timeline considering he turned 74 in mid-September. Minority owner Tom Brady, who was heavily involved in the Carroll hire, and owner Mark Davis have yet another major call on their hands as they hope to get the once-proud franchise back on track.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback Cam Ward has been diagnosed with an AC joint sprain in his right shoulder, according to NFL Media. Ward exited Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars after a defender landed on him at the end of a touchdown run.While this injury affects Ward's first full NFL offseason, the worst-case scenario seems to have been avoided. Ward's injury will not require surgery as he looks to build upon a strong finish to his rookie campaign.Fewer than five minutes into the Titans' season finale, a 41-7 loss, Ward kept the ball on a designed run and dove for the goal line. He came down on his right shoulder, and as he did, Jaguars linebacker Foyesade Oluokun landed on top of him with a lot of force.Ward was slow to get up, and when he returned to the sideline, he entered the injury tent. After exiting, he walked back to the locker room. The Titans quickly labeled Ward as questionable before ruling him out.\nThe injury ends Ward's bid to play every offensive snap in his rookie campaign. He was the only quarterback with that distinction coming into the day.Before exiting the game, Ward helped Tennessee get off to a fast start. He completed all three of his passes for 52 yards and rushed for 11 yards and the aforementioned touchdown.Brandon Allen entered the game in relief of Ward, and he will have the reins the rest of the way. Because fo Ward's durability and availability, Allen didn't see any action in the first 17 weeks of the season. A sixth-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, Allen completed 17 of 30 pass attempts for 56 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions as a backup with the San Francisco 49ers last season.\nWard's late-season surge comes to an abrupt endThe No. 1 overall pick in 2025, Ward's rookie season got off to a discouraging start. Between rookie mistakes, a shaky offensive line and an unimpressive wide receiver room, Ward struggled to gain traction at the NFL level.However, around a month ago, something seemed to click. He started playing more consistently, and the Titans started finding the end zone with a little more frequency. Dating back to the Titans' Week 14 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ward showed legitimate signs of progress.Over that four-game stretch, Ward completed 59.2% of his passes for eight touchdowns and just one interception while averaging 191.5 yards per game. Ward also became the first Titans quarterback to throw at least two touchdown passes in four consecutive weeks since Ryan Tannehill accomplished that feat in 2020.\nIn the 12 games prior to that run, Ward struggled, especially when it came to protecting the football. Over that span, Ward tossed seven interceptions to six interceptions, which came in consecutive games. He also fumbled the ball nine times, and a number of those came as a result of him trying to do too much in the backfield.Ward's improved late-season play generated a clear impact on the team overall -- the Titans were 2-2 in those four games and averaged 26.7 points per game. On the season, Tennessee averaged just 17.3 points per game prior to Sunday. Rookie receivers Chimere Diek and Elic Ayomanor also emerged to make some key plays for the Titans.Ward ends his season with a 59.8% completion rate, 3,169 yards, 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions, but those numbers don't tell the whole story. Ward showed flashes of greatness down the stretch, and that should encourage the Titans as they look toward the 2026 season.\n            ",

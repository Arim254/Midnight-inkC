    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Alex Pereira and Magomed Ankalaev are worse for wear after <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-magomed-ankalaev-vs-alex-pereira-2-results-winners-highlights-fight-card-complete-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">UFC 320</a></span>. Pereira, the UFC light heavyweight champion, broke his foot during his main event fight on Oct. 6. Meanwhile, reports claim Ankalaev fought with a broken rib.</p><p>Pereira is shockingly compromised despite how quickly he decimated Ankalaev at UFC 320. After <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-320-live-updates-results-fight-card-magomed-ankalaev-alex-pereira-2/live/\" target=\"_blank\">knocking out Ankalaev</a> in 80 seconds, \"Poatan\" limped out of the Octagon with what he believed was a broken foot. On Friday, Pereira confirmed a foot fracture during a Q&A in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>\"I did an X-Ray in Las Vegas and an MRI here, and we have a fracture on  my foot, but I still don't know what will happen, or how long it will  take for me to recover,\" Pereira said, according to <a href=\"https://www.mmafighting.com/ufc/449453/alex-pereira-reveals-injury-suffered-in-ufc-320-win-eyes-ufc-white-house-fight\" target=\"_blank\">MMA Fighting</a>, before Saturday's <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/ufc-fight-night-predictions-odds-fight-card-expert-picks-for-charles-oliveira-vs-mateusz-gamrot/\" target=\"_blank\">UFC Fight Night</a></span>. </p><p>A broken foot normally requires four to six weeks to heal, with a maximum of 12 weeks, according to the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/broken-foot-fractured-foot\" target=\"_blank\">Cleveland Clinic</a>. Once healed, it can take six months for the bone to support weight-bearing demands for greater physical activity. A worst-case timeline could sideline Pereira until April. \"Poatan\" continued advocating for a <span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/president-donald-trump-confirms-ufc-white-house-date-dana-white-denies-conor-mcgregor-is-booked/\" target=\"_blank\">White House fight</a></span> with Jon Jones, which would give him approximately 8-9 weeks to train after he's fully healed if he's out until April.</p><p>\"I think it's good to focus  on this White House [date], it's something that interests me,\" Pereira said. \"I think  I'll focus on this.\" </p><p>Last week, Pereira detailed the moment he believes the injury occurred.</p>\n<p>\"It's my foot,\" Pereira, wearing a boot, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hESHFh7dxPo\" target=\"_blank\">told reporters</a>, via a Portuguese interpreter, at the UFC 320 post-fight press conference. \"I'm pretty sure it's broken. The inside calf kicks were working. I threw a few of those, and then he  switched stances, and I think I was in the wrong range. And I threw  another kick to his lead leg, and it landed on the tip of my foot. I  think it's broken.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mma/news/conor-mcgregor-suspended-18-months-for-ufc-anti-doping-violation/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>Conor McGregor suspended 18 months for UFC anti-doping violation</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"Conor McGregor suspended 18 months for UFC anti-doping violation\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/07/ff9d22ad-2969-4120-b359-f17f9897d8fb/thumbnail/270x152/549f41b197d280e6bfa16dfc9a240985/conor-mcgregor-ufc-264-weigh-in-dustin-poirier-white-house-suspension-mma-news-today-cbs-sports-oct-7-2025.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>While Pereira believes he suffered the injury in the fight, Ankalaev might have entered the fight with an injury of his own. Ali Abdelaziz, Ankalaev's manager, claimed there were many reasons Ankalaev should not have followed through with the fight, but wouldn't specify why.</p><p>\"There are a lot of things happened with Ankalaev in his camp,\" Abdelaziz <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPczAXqkT36/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=d1720ea7-4725-447f-9427-b1d8ab3b20d7\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on Instagram. \"But, it's  for him to talk about. Not me. And if I need to talk about it, I will  talk about it. If it was up to me, he should never have fought due to  some things. But he's a grown man, he makes his own decisions, and he  lives by his actions.\" </p><p>On Monday, reports emerged that Ankalaev fought Pereira with a broken rib. Léo Guimaraes, whose Twitter bio describes him as a combat sports journalist, <a href=\"https://x.com/leoguimaraesmma/status/1975315482342531302\" target=\"_blank\">posted a video</a> of Ankalaev undergoing rib treatment approximately 20 days before the fight.

As was the case last year, Crown Jewel will be anchored by matches between WWE's top men's and women's champions for the honorary Crown Jewel championship. It all goes down from the RAC Arena on Saturday night in Perth.</p><p>For the men, that means a match between world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins and undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes. The women's Crown Jewel championship match is now set as women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer will take on WWE women's champion Tiffany Stratton.</p><p>In addition, John Cena returns for one of his final appearances when he takes on AJ Styles as the two revisit one of the promotion's top rivalries of the 2010s. Cena has been out of action since Wrestlepalooza and only has a handful of appearances booked through the end of the year, when he is expected to retire. Styles, meanwhile, also recently said he expects to retire by the end of 2026.</p><p>Plus, roman Reigns makes his return to a PPV card when he takes on Bronson Reed in n Australian Street Fight. And Asuka and Kairi Sane are set to team up and face Iyo Sky and Rhea Ripley.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-hall-of-fame-2026-stephanie-mcmahon-becomes-first-inductee-to-next-class-after-undertakers-surprise/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"WWE Hall of Fame 2026: Stephanie McMahon becomes first inductee to next class after Undertaker's surprise\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/09/21/4c7f6d7d-c427-484b-a45e-757c38e65b74/thumbnail/270x152/0f4cca3123a1cf94fb4f003fa58c11d7/pay14-photo-190.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>Let's take a look at what we know -- and what we expect -- from Crown Jewel, which takes place Oct. 11 from RAC Arena in Perth, Australia.</p><h2>2025 WWE Crown Jewel matches</h2><p><strong>Men's Crown Jewel Championship</strong> <strong>-- Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins:</strong> Rhodes and Rollins came face-to-face shortly after Wrestlepalooza, knowing the champion vs. champion match was more or less locked in. Rollins has questioned what Rhodes thinks of him and his \"vision\" for the future of wrestling, while Rhodes has questioned why Rollins needs the backup of \"goons\" if he's the best in the world. These two have a fairly lengthy history, dating back to Rhodes being Rollins' surprise opponent at WrestleMania 38 in Rhodes' return to WWE.</p><p><strong>Women's Crown Jewel Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer vs. Tiffany Stratton:</strong> Vaquer won the women's world championship at Wrestlepalooza in a terrific match with Iyo Sky for the vacant title. Now, she takes on Stratton as she has reigned as WWE women's champion since the beginning of the year. She's coming off a brutal triple threat match against Jade Cargill and Nia Jax on SmackDown on Sept. 26 that left Cargill badly cut. Vaquer and Stratton will now cross paths for the first time in their careers.</p>\n<p><strong>AJ Styles vs. John Cena:</strong> Cena and Styles had some fantastic matches around 2017. Those matches were among the best of Cena's entire career. That is pretty much the entire storyline of why this match is happening, with no real animosity or storyline beyond. Of course, maybe Cena has to deal with a surprise attack from someone like Brock Lesnar once again as his final days in WWE wind down.</p><p><strong>Roman Reigns vs. Bronson Reed (Australian Street Fight):</strong> Reed and Reigns met at Clash in Paris, with Reigns winning before Reed unleashed an onslaught after the match, taking Reigns out of action. Reigns recently returned and Reed, with Paul Heyman by his side, wanted to run it back, though this time in a match type that Reed \"made famous.\" Reigns was happy to accept and the rematch is on, and this time with no rules.</p><p><strong>Asuka & Kairi Sane vs. Iyo Sky & Rhea Ripley:</strong> After weeks of teasing a split, Asuka finally turned on Sky after Sky protected Ripley following an Asuka mist attack. Sane has sided with Asuka because she claims Asuka is why Sane and Sky are in WWE. After Sane and Asuka offered Sky a chance to apologize and return to her \"family,\" Sky was the next to suffer an Asuka mist attack. That was the last straw for Sky, who had struggled to break away from Asuka, and the Crown Jewel tag match was official.</p>\n            </div>",

Skubal had a 2.00 ERA against the rest of baseball, so although Skubal's greatness is undeniable, he hasn't been nearly as elite against the Mariners. Julio Rodriguez hit one of his 32 home runs off Skubal this season, and Jorge Polanco, who had 26 home runs this season, hit two homers off Skubal in Game 2. Cal Raleigh led baseball with 60 home runs this season, so Seattle has the offensive ability to take down Skubal on Friday, and the model projects the Mariners to win in 60% of simulations.</p><h3>Colorado State (+6.5) vs. Fresno State (-110)</h3><p>Fresno State is 5-1 this season, but the Bulldogs' last two wins have come by a combined five points. The Bulldogs failed to cover the spread in either of those victories, and they are 1-2 against the spread on the road this season. Fresno State defeated Colorado State, 28-22, at home last season, failing to cover this number when the Bulldogs were on their home field, but they'll travel to Colorado State for this matchup. The model projects Colorado State to cover the spread in 55% of simulations for a 9 p.m. ET start on CBS Sports Network.</p><h3>Rutgers vs. Washington Under 61.5 total points (-112)</h3><p>Each of these teams had huge offensive outbursts over their first three games, but none of those were in Big Ten play, and their totals have slowed down since the conference season began. After five of their first six combined games went Over this total, three of their last four combined games have gone Under it, with Washington going Under this number in each Big Ten contest. Washington went Under its over/under given by the sportsbooks in each Big Ten contest as well. Rutgers defeated Washington, 21-18, last year in a lower-scoring game, and the model projects the Under to hit in 63% of simulations.</p><h2>Want more college football and MLB picks for Friday?</h2><p><strong>You've seen the model's Friday best bets.

This year's event will be held in Perth, Australia, though it will operate under the same format as last year's Crown Jewel.</p><p>That means two headline matches featuring WWE's top champions. On the men's side, undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes will take on world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins. For the women, world champion Iyo Sky will face WWE women's champion Tiffany Stratton. The winners of those matches will win the ceremonial Crown Jewel championship, taking home a ring for their victory.</p><p>In addition, John Cena returns for one of his final appearances when he takes on AJ Styles as the two revisit one of the promotion's top rivalries of the 2010s. Cena has been out of action since Wrestlepalooza and only has a handful of appearances booked through the end of the year, when he is expected to retire. Styles, meanwhile, also recently said he expects to retire by the end of 2026.</p><p>Plus, roman Reigns makes his return to a PPV card when he takes on Bronson Reed in n Australian Street Fight. And Asuka and Kairi Sane are set to team up and face Iyo Sky and Rhea Ripley.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/john-cena-admits-his-wwe-heel-turn-failed-i-went-out-there-and-bombed/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <p>John Cena admits his WWE heel turn failed: 'I went out there and bombed'</p>\n                <p>\n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                </p>\n            </div>\n                            <div>\n    <figure><img alt=\"John Cena admits his WWE heel turn failed: 'I went out there and bombed'\" src=\"https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/08/cdb5017b-5e41-45af-aa6d-f4847bf3fecb/thumbnail/270x152/8ac11f1a78297520483f6e66b7fe9b25/john-cena-wrestlemania-41-retirement-tour-heel-cbs-sports-pro-wrestling-news-today-oct-8-2025.jpg\" /></figure>\n                </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n<p>With so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action goes down in Perth.</p><h2>2025 WWE Crown Jewel predictions</h2><p><strong><em>Men's Crown Jewel Championship </em>-- Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins:</strong> The Crown Jewel stipulation is tailor-made for Rhodes to lose. It's meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Rhodes solidified himself as a top draw by repeatedly beating Rollins upon his return to WWE. It's about time Rollins got one over on \"The American Nightmare.\" On Raw, CM Punk teased that he respects Rhodes too much to get involved in his business, suggesting The Vision's numbers game could get the better of the son of a son of a plumber. <em><strong>Pick: Seth Rollins wins</strong> -- Shakiel Mahjouri</em></p><p>Maybe I lean too heavily into what would be most interesting rather than what WWE is likely to do. Rhodes having Rollins' number and causing a crisis of confidence for The Vision's leader is interesting; Rollins winning with the assistance of Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker is not. Similarly, Rollins winning on his own doesn't really do much for how the story of The Vision is being constructed. Paul Heyman already sent a message to Rollins that a loss was unacceptable and would make him question the decision to back Rollins over Roman Reigns. Would Breakker be content to sit behind a man who can't get the job done against Rhodes? The most interesting option is for Rhodes to win, so that's what WWE should do. <em><strong>Pick: Cody Rhodes wins</strong> -- Brent Brookhouse</em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Women's Crown Jewel Championship </em>-- Tiffany Stratton vs. Stephanie Vaquer:</strong> Vaquer is a fresh champion who needs to continue building credibility as a main event-level star. Stratton has had a good run with her title, so a loss isn't particularly damaging in the same way it would be for Vaquer. That makes for some pretty simple math that just says to give Vaquer the victory. <em><strong>Pick: Stephanie Vaquer wins</strong> -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)</em></p><p><strong>John Cena vs. AJ Styles:</strong> Cena vs. Styles is the most deserving farewell tour match requiring the least storyline build. They had shockingly great matches at the height of their rivalry. That's enough to warrant one last tango. It's just a shame most of Cena's retirement tour has been half-baked. Cena's loss to Brock Lesnar at Wrestlepalooza really deflated fans. It's unlikely he takes another clean loss with his final match fast approaching. Styles, who recently said he'd retire next year, doesn't have much to gain by beating Cena. All anyone wants to see is one more solid outing from one of the most surprising hit feuds in WWE history. <em><strong>Pick: John Cena wins</strong> -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)</em></p><p><strong>Roman Reigns vs. Bronson Reed:</strong> Reigns matches are so rare that it makes the results fairly predictable. Reed has been around to give Reigns someone he can defeat to stay around the title picture without actually being in it. It's hard to imagine Reed being given a win over Reigns. What purpose would that serve? To set up a third Reigns vs. Reed match? That doesn't seem like a good way to use Reigns moving forward. That should mean a win for Reigns so he can move on to Breakker. <em><strong>Pick: Roman Reigns wins</strong> -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rhea Ripley & Iyo Sky vs. The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane):</strong> Ripley and Sky are bigger stars than The Kabuki Warriors. Plain and simple. It doesn't seem WWE has much planned long-term for the villainous duo, at least not enough to give them a win over two of the women's division's biggest stars. This match is mostly an excuse to get Ripley in front of her home fans. Expect \"Mami\" to pick up a big win for her fellow Aussies. <em><strong>Pick: Rhea Ripley & Iyo Sky win</strong> -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)</em></p>\n            </div>",

    "description": "<div>\n        <p><span>AUSTIN, Texas -- </span>The day before the U.S. men's national team's friendly against Ecuador, head coach Mauricio Pochettino ",
    "body": "<div>\n        <p><span>AUSTIN, Texas -- </span>The day before the U.S. men's national team's friendly against Ecuador, head coach Mauricio Pochettino wasted no time reminding everyone that his focus for the time being is performance rather than results. He got a game that encapsulated that exact sentiment on Friday night at Q2 Stadium, where the USMNT came from behind and settled for a 1-1 draw, showcasing some genuine signs of progress and lending credence to Pochettino's idea that the team is, at long last, trending in the right direction.</p><p>Pochettino's first year in the job was marked by unimpressive -- and at times, uninspiring -- results, but as he celebrates a year in the role, the USMNT have traded a sense of doom and gloom for some downright normalcy. In some sense, they were merely the latest victims of Ecuador's egregiously defensive approach that saw them finish second in CONMEBOL's World Cup qualifying competition despite scoring just 14 goals in 18 games, the 35-year-old (or ageless) Enner Valencia nicking a goal from a quick counterattack before the half-hour mark. The U.S. team were not exactly perfect throughout, the midfield trio of Weston McKennie, Tanner Tessman and Aidan Morris not always clicking after months away from a group with a new look, while the hosts were a little bit wasteful in attack as the game continued. None of the USMNT's issues on Friday evening, though, seemed atypical of a team that still has eight months to go before the opening game of the World Cup.</p><p>As Pochettino marks his first anniversary, the stamp he is beginning to leave on the team is clear and was on full display against Ecuador. While <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnts-mauricio-pochettino-says-no-player-is-a-lock-for-world-cup-roster-as-competitiveness-remains-priority/\">a newfound competitiveness</a> for playing time was apparent from the moment the roster dropped last week, Pochettino's version of the USMNT has a tactical flexibility that the previous iteration under his predecessor Gregg Berhalter did not. The back three he debuted in last month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan returned against Ecuador, this time with some new tweaks -- or specifically, a different look in and out of possession.</p><p>\"I think we keep, now, playing the way that we plan to play,\" Pochettino said after the match. \"I think we defend with a back four, two midfielders and three and one and of course, the 'keeper -- 1-4-2-3-1 -- but then our formation building from [the] back, we [were] building with three, two and then five.\"</p>\n<p>The personnel choices were equally as intriguing, with Miles Robinson joining mainstays Chris Richards and Tim Ream at center back while Max Arfsten and Tim Weah balanced each other out in respective roles on the left and right flanks. Weah described his role pre-match as the one of the \"fake wingback,\" simply explaining afterward that \"I would be doing less defending 'cause Miles was covering the whole time so that was pretty much it and in the attack, I was playing like a normal winger.\" Pochettino noted how Arfsten, a more traditional fullback, and Weah's distinct styles added new layers to Friday's game plan.</p><p>\"That is about hav[ing] different dimensions but that change depends on, also, the position of how we want to attack, how we want to use the channels, how we want to be vigilant if [the opponents] play with one striker, two strikers,\" Pochettino said.\"That is really important and we start to see how [to] change the set-up depend[ing] on the height [of the defensive line] of the opposition -- low block, medium block -- or when you are in the opposite half, different situations can happen. My appreciation, my opinion on his performance is that I think he did well. He did well when he was a winger trying to go in the diagonal to try to create chances. He had a few shots from the outside of the box and then when he was like a wingback because, [Pervis] Estupinan first and then when [Yaimar] Medina [was switched] in, to force him to defend a little bit closer than Miles and then close to [substitute] Alex Freeman.\"</p><p>There was still a mixed bag element from the USMNT, the team openly admitting that they could have turned more of their 11 shots into clear-cut opportunities. That said, there was a clear idea at play. Each time the USMNT had the ball -- which was often in a game in which they had nearly 65% possession -- the emphasis was to attack as quickly and cohesively as possible. Their attacking outing was also impressive in its own right considering the circumstances -- Sebastian Beccacece's Ecuador conceded just five goals in 18 World Cup qualification matches and it is not all that hard to envision a reality in which a more clinical USMNT would have scored multiple goals against them. Even if a draw is a fair enough result for both sides, the game started to tilt in the U.S.' favor in the second half.</p>\n<p>\"We started to look the fresher team as the game wore on and listen, as someone who's been on the other side of that, you know and you smell that,\" Ream said. \"You're like, okay, these guys … are starting to be a little bit gassed and you actually feel more energized and it allows you to get on top of them more and start making more little plays, being connected better. I think we were connected pretty well in the first half but even closer connections in the second half and I'll tell you what, it takes a toll on teams and it did that today.\"</p><p>This version of the team felt incomplete in part because Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Tyler Adams were not in the starting lineup for varying reasons -- Pulisic came on as a substitute and Robinson is not fully fit yet, while Adams did not make the trip as he and his wife await the birth of their second child. None of this comes as a surprise at this point and there are still questions to be answered about what the USMNT is capable of if those players are not on the field, especially Adams. The puzzle pieces feel like they are starting to finally come together, though, with a handful of standout individual performances headlined by Malik Tillman, who continued to prove his worth as one of Pochettino's breakouts with the assist to the USMNT's second-half goal. The credit for that, in the end, went to Folarin Balogun, who has two goals and one assist in his three games under Pochettino so far, reasserting himself once again as Pochettino's go-to No. 9.</p><p>The normalcy of the moment was not lost on Pochettino, either.</p><p>\"I think the performance was a very, very serious performance, very professional,\" he said. \"I think what works the most is that we are here talking about actions, concepts, formations, things like this that for me, after one year, I am so, so, so happy that we don't talk about other things like commitment, attitude or things that normally in the past we were talking [about]. I think that this is a massive step up because I think we need to forget that always, win or lose, it depends [on] our performance. If we are better and [if] we make sure we are better than our opponent, we can win. If we don't show that, it's because it's a soccer problem, not [that] it's another problem that is dangerous when these types of things happen in a team.\"</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>By the time the buzzer sounded in Phoenix on Friday night and the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LVA/las-vegas-aces/\">Las Vegas Aces</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/news/aces-mercury-live-updates-wnba-finals-game-4-score-results/live/\" target=\"_blank\">sealed their WNBA Finals sweep</a> over the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/PHO/phoenix-mercury/\">Phoenix Mercury</a> to win their third championship in four years, there was no doubt who would be named Finals MVP.</p><p>It was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677908/aja-wilson/\">A'ja Wilson's</a> trophy, given at the culmination of A'ja Wilson's season, smack dab in the middle of the A'ja Wilson era of women's basketball. It is hard to have a true GOAT conversation while a player is in the prime of their career, but it's certainly clear you can't start that conversation without mentioning Wilson -- and it feels inevitable that one day soon her name it going to end it, too.</p><p>But there will be time for those debates, short as they may be. For now I feel confident saying this: This was the most impressive season of her already HOF-worthy career. And it's not because led the league in points (23.4), blocks (2.3) and efficiency (29.2), was second in rebounds (10.2) and fourth in steals (1.6). Or because she led the Aces on a 16-game winning streak to close out the regular season. Or because she won the MVP award last month, passing Lisa Leslie, Lauren Jackson and Sheryl Swoopes to become the first four-time MVP in WNBA history. Or because she averaged 26.5 points, 10.1 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.5 blocks and 2.1 steals per game this postseason, career highs in every category except rebounds. Or because she hit one of the most iconic game-winning shots in Finals history on Wednesday night to put the Aces up 3-0 in the series. Or because she became the first player in the WNBA or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/nba/\">NBA</a> to win the scoring title, MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP in the same year.</p><p>Sure, those things count. But what really set her season apart was her leadership.</p>\n<p>I'm not the only one saying this. Las Vegas head coach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/1105013/becky-hammon/\">Becky Hammon</a> praised Wilson's leadership before the MVP presentation last month, recalling that during the \"embarrassing moments\" this season, Wilson started taking her teammates aside one by one and pouring into them. </p><p>\"This is the result of all the work that you don't get to see,\" Hammon said. \"You know, she's just a tireless worker, and where she took us this year from where we were -- if there was a leadership trophy, you know, this is the MVP skills trophy, but she has led tremendously through some really rough waters.\"</p><p>All championship teams talk about their struggles in dramatically wrought terms. But Hammon and the Aces aren't exaggerating when recalling their low points in 2025. The Aces spent the first few months of the season teetering around the .500 mark, and things hit rock bottom on Aug. 2 when they lost by 53 points at home to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/MIN/minnesota-lynx/\">Minnesota Lynx</a> to drop to 14-14. At that point, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677824/napheesa-collier/\">Napheesa Collier</a> was the runaway favorite for MVP, too.</p>\n<p>ESPN's Michael Voepel reported that after that 53-point loss, Wilson sent her teammates a text that set the tone for the rest of the season: <em>\"If you weren't embarrassed from yesterday, then don't come into this gym. You're not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing.\"</em></p><p>But she didn't just address them as a group and digitally; she found a way to speak the truth to each of them and bring out the best of them in the process.</p><p>According to point guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677818/chelsea-gray/\">Chelsea Gray</a>, in the first half of the season Wilson told her bluntly, \"There's no way I should ever have more assists than you.\" As reported by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/46504821/wnba-finals-2025-las-vegas-aces-phoenix-mercury-chelsea-gray-remark-aja-wilson\">ESPN's Katie Barnes</a>, before that remark, Gray was averaging just 4.3 assists per game; the rest of the season Gray averaged 7.1 assists per game. This postseason Gray averaged 7.5 assists per game, a career high for the 32-year-old point guard who now has four WNBA championships to her name – three with Wilson and the Aces, and one from 2016 with the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/LAS/los-angeles-sparks/\">Los Angeles Sparks</a>.</p>\n<p>It says a lot about Wilson's character not only that she was willing to call out one of the best point guards in WNBA history, but that she had built up enough trust and clout with Gray over the years for Gray to truly listen to her and not just get defensive.</p><p>And it says even more that she seems to have that level of trust and clout with every member of the team. Twenty-five-year-old forward <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850649/nalyssa-smith/\">NaLyssa Smith</a> was traded to the Aces from the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/teams/DAL/dallas-wings/\">Dallas Wings</a> midseason. She had never played with Wilson before, but had long been a fan -- cameras caught Wilson giving Smith advice and encouragement on the court <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.si.com/onsi/womens-fastbreak/news/nalyssa-smith-sends-4-word-message-about-a-ja-wilson-s-on-court-coaching-advice-01jte6x7ghb8\">during a preseason game</a> at the start of the year when the two were still on opposing teams.</p><p>Wilson immediately took Smith <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/wnba/article/how-nalyssa-smith-has-helped-power-the-las-vegas-aces-turnaround-alongside-aja-wilson-its-been-a-beautiful-thing-to-see-162108137.html\">under her wing</a> after the trade, helping her adapt to the team by giving her tips, motivating her throughout the game and making sure she stayed mentally focused. That investment paid off. Smith played some of the best basketball of her career this summer and played a key role in the Aces' turnaround.</p>\n<p>But in my opinion, the most impressive display of her leadership came in a video shared by the Aces' social media team after Wilson won her MVP award. In the video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqn-8KRybGk&list=PPSV&t=2s\" target=\"_blank\">Wilson was surprised by hand-written notes of congratulations</a> from each of her teammates. She sobbed as she read each and every one out loud -- and after listening to them all, I don't blame her.</p><p>One by one, her teammates showered words of praise at Wilson, words that go far beyond generic teammate talk.</p><p>\"I remember last year, you mentioned how you wanted to be a better leader in your last press conference. I just wanted to tell you that you're the best leader I've ever had, and I'm so blessed to compete with you,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677836/dana-evans/\">Dana Evans</a>, a reserve point guard in her first season with the Aces, wrote.</p>\n<p>\"People can talk all day about what you are as a basketball player, because you're the best. But I want to tell you how much you mean to people as a human,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/28850661/kierstan-bell/\">Kierstan Bell</a>, who just finished her fourth year with the Aces, said. \"You show up every single day and make it known that you will run through a wall for the people you love, which is why there's no doubt if I would ever do the same for you.\"</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26686148/megan-gustafson/\">Megan Gustafson</a> added that Wilson is \"truly one of the best leaders I've ever witnessed.

The way you serve and show up for your people is a testament to your character.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26678025/jackie-young/\">Jackie Young</a> wrote, \"I thank you for challenging me to get out of my shell and always believing in me and cussing me out when I needed it.\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/wnba/players/26677854/cheyenne-parker-tyus/\">Cheyenne Parker-Tyus</a>, who gave birth to her second child this season, said, \"The way you carry yourself is truly top tier, and I pray that my daughter has the same amount of love, strength and greatness that you show every day as a true leader and a champion.\"</p><p>And Smith shone light on why exactly Wilson's leadership is so effective: \"The kind of person you are, the kind of leader you are makes me want to go harder every day, not just for myself, but because my favorite player believes in me. ... I thank you every day from the bottom of my heart for being the person you are to me and helping me love basketball again.\"</p>\n<p>Even more moving than the words themselves was Wilson's reaction to each name that she read and each compliment she absorbed. Her obsession and adoration for each of her teammates was palpable through the screen.</p><p>\"This team, oh, man, I would never get tired of talking about this team and my teammates. They are, they're my heartbeat, they're my heartstrings. They are the reason why I love coming into work every single day, and I'm just so appreciative to be able to call them my teammates, my sisters, my road dogs, my partner, anything in between. I'm blessed. I'm really blessed,\" she said.</p><p>It's not unusual to see stars get along with teammates, or gush about them in big moments. But to see a superstar at Wilson's level have such a genuine connection with her entire roster, top to bottom, is truly rare. Ultimately, that's what sets Wilson apart from everyone else. Her greatness comes with accountability, not dramatics. Her confidence lifts people up, it doesn't tear people down. She knows how important she is to her team and to the game as a whole, but seems to truly believe that everyone in her orbit has the same import. </p>\n<p>This season put Wilson to the test like no other. And she didn't just pass, she made sure everyone around her did, too. That belongs on her GOAT resume, too. </p>\n            </div>",

No deal is imminent, but those talks follow a meeting Pujols had on Thursday with general manager Perry Minasian.</p><p>Right after the regular season concluded, the Angels announced that neither manager Ron Washington nor interim skipper Ray Montgomery would return to their dugout in 2026. Montgomery, of course, filled in for Washington when the latter was on medical leave.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/albert-pujols-angels-manager-owner-arte-moreno-reportedly-wants-future-all-star-as-next-skipper/\">Pujols was subsequently named as owner Arte Moreno's preferred candidate to take over</a>. It's worth noting that Pujols remains employed by the Angels. The contract he signed with the club as a player included a 10-year personal-services pact upon his retirement. Pujols has essentially served as an ambassador for the organization since walking away after the 2022 season. (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/mlb/\">MLB</a> has since banned personal service contracts, and it's unclear how it would factor in here.)</p>\n<p>Pujols, 45, remains slated to manage the Dominican Republic in next spring's World Baseball Classic. Last winter, he won the Dominican Winter League championship as the manager of Leones del Esogido.</p><p>Pujols was one of the best players in recent baseball memory. Across parts of 22 years, he hit.296/.374/.544 with 703 home runs and 117 stolen bases. His contributions were worth 101.2 Wins Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference's estimations. Pujols was an 11-time All-Star honoree, a three-time Most Valuable Player Award winner, a two-time Gold Glove Award winner, a six-time Silver Slugger Award winner, and a two-time World Series title winner.</p>\n<p>The Angels have had little success or stability at manager since Mike Sciscoia vacated the post in winter 2018. Pujols would be their fifth full-time skipper in the last eight years, alongside Washington, Phil Nevin, Joe Maddon, and Brad Ausmus.</p>\n            </div>\n    </div>",

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>Developing a successful NFL DFS strategy can take many forms, but one of the most common approaches is focusing on games with the highest projected point totals when identifying top NFL DFS picks and building NFL DFS stacks.The highest over/under in the NFL odds for the Sunday main slate is 49.5 in the Cowboys vs. Panthers matchup. Other potential high-scoring matchups on Sunday include 49ers vs. Buccaneers, Seahawks vs. Jaguars, and Colts vs. Cardinals. Thus, you can expect stars like Dak Prescott, Tetairoa McMillan, Christian McCaffrey and Jonathan Taylor to be core players in many NFL DFS lineups. </p><p>Players of that caliber, however, will set back your NFL DFS salary cap, forcing you to search for more potential NFL DFS sleepers and NFL DFS values. Should players like Daniel Jones or Baker Mayfield find their way into your quarterback slot for Sunday's main slate? Will underperforming players like Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins finally live up to their price tags on NFL DFS sites?

The former fourth-round pick out of Mississippi State had his 2024 season shortened by injury, but he still managed to throw for 1,978 yards with 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions in eight games, finishing with an 86.0 passer rating. In 2025, he has rebounded with one of his most efficient starts in years.</p><p>Through five weeks, Prescott has 1,356 passing yards, 10 touchdowns, and just three interceptions. The 32-year-old has regained his rhythm as the leader of the Cowboys' offense, showcasing improved decision-making and accuracy. His ability to extend plays and deliver under pressure has been a major factor in keeping Dallas competitive early in the season. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=10092025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek6Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">See who else to pick here</a>.</p><p>The optimizer's NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Rams running back Kyren Williams ($6,300 on DraftKings and $8,400 on FanDuel). The former fifth-round pick out of Notre Dame burst onto the 2024 season as the Rams' every-down workhorse, carrying the ball 316 times for 1,299 yards and scoring 14 rushing touchdowns, while also adding 34 catches for 182 receiving yards. His volume and versatility marked him as one of L.A.'s most reliable offensive weapons. </p><p>In 2025, he's off to a another solid start. Through five weeks, he's already logged 82 carries for 368 yards (4.5 yards per carry) with one rushing score, and chipped in as a receiver with 16 catches for 118 yards and three receiving touchdowns. Despite sharing some of the workload with Blake Corum, Williams remains the focal point of the backfield and has even secured a three-year, $33 million contract extension from the Rams. <a href=\"https://www.sportsline.com/nfl/daily-fantasy/optimizer/#ttag=10092025_agg_cbssports_dfs_football_nfl_Optimizer_NFLDFSWeek6Sunday\" target=\"_blank\">You can see the rest of the optimizer's NFL DFS picks here</a>.</p><p><em>New users can also check out the latest </em><span><a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/betting/news/fanduel-promo-code/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>FanDuel promo code</em></a></span><em> and </em><a href=\"https://martech.cbssports.com/bt/redirect/prod?b=fanduel&c=sport\" target=\"_blank\"><em>get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins</em></a><em>. </em></p><h2>How to build Sunday Week 6 NFL DFS lineups</h2><p>The NFL DFS Optimizer is also targeting multiple undervalued players who could explode for huge numbers on Sunday.

Norvell, who is in his fourth season leading the program, is facing mounting pressure to win and salvage the 2025 season.</p><p>Offensively, freshman running back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388915/jalen-dupree/\">Jalen Dupree</a> has paced the ground game with 370 rushing yards and a touchdown, while wide receiver <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28902160/armani-winfield/\">Armani Winfield</a> has emerged as the top target, hauling in 13 passes for 203 receiving yards and a score.

    "body": "<div>\n        <p>DENTON, Texas -- No. 24 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/SFLA/south-florida-bulls/\">South Florida</a> made its marquee road trip to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/NTEXAS/north-texas-mean-green/\">North Texas</a> awfully difficult ... at least for a half. </p><p>The Mean Green brought out all the stops. They sold out DATCU Stadium for the first time in program history -- on a high school football Friday night, no less. North Texas coach Eric Morris brought out some trickery and misdirection on key plays to build an early lead, especially as USF turned it over three times in the first quarter alone. </p><p>But it's nothing fancy or offensive wizardry from coach Alex Golesh that got the Bulls back on top in a 63-36 win to take control of the American Conference. It was old fashioned bully ball. </p><p>During a 5-minute stretch between the second and third quarter, South Florida showed the physicality that separates it from the rest of the Group of Five. The Bulls recovered a muffed punt and used the threat of a run to set up a pop pass for a touchdown. Then, they marched down the field with ease against an exhausted North Texas defense on the first drive of the second half in 69 seconds using tempo. </p>\n<p>North Texas quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29388141/drew-mestemaker/\">Drew Mestemaker</a> was electric in the first half, but the walls started to close in as the Bulls' defensive line got home. He whiffed on six consecutive passes in the middle-eight, including two interceptions. When he finally completed a pass, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26728691/simeon-evans/\">Simeon Evans</a> fumbled the ball after he got smacked by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29120688/jarvis-lee/\">Jarvis Lee</a>, and the ball was returned by South Florida for a touchdown. </p><p>In only 3:27 of game time, a 21-14 North Texas lead flipped to a 42-21 South Florida lead and the rout was on. Outside of that one sequence, the teams were largely equal. But even on a day where the Bulls did not bring their best football, their physicality gives them an advantage that could carry them perhaps all the way to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbssports.com/college-football/\">College Football</a> Playoff. </p><p>\"We're playing very physically,\" quarterback Byrum Brown said. \"You can just feel when our offensive line is feeling it. We were getting their D-Line pushed back 3 yards a pop. Them just leaning on opponents has been huge for our offense.\"</p>\n<p>On one of South Florida's first plays, quarterback <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/28876844/byrum-brown/\">Byrum Brown</a> dropped back in the pocket and didn't see blitzing defensive back <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/29393665/quinton-hammonds/\">Quinton Hammonds</a>. The ball dropped out of his hand, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BRO/brown-bears/\">Brown</a> barely moved from the direct hit. UNT was able to mitigate some of the issues against its defensive line with a quick passing game, but soon, defensive tackle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26702750/jacob-merrifield/\">Jacob Merrifield</a> and nose guard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/50008940/traevon-mitchell/\">Traevon Mitchell</a> each got home. </p><p>That level of team strength was forged over the last year after the Bulls limped out to a disappointing 7-6 campaign. The defense surrendered 104 points over their final four games against lackluster competition and proved unable to push even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULSA/tulsa-golden-hurricane/\">Tulsa</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/RICE/rice-owls/\">Rice</a> off their spots. </p><p>South Florida boasts perhaps the top NIL budget in the conference in 2025, sources told CBS Sports ... and they put it to good use. </p>\n<p>The Bulls added six defensive line and edge players via the transfer portal and now have a level of size and depth that few in the Group of Five can match. Four defensive tackles on the depth chart weigh more than 280 pounds, including former SEC transfers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/26696048/devin-lee/\">Devin Lee</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/players/3170065/josh-celiscar/\">Josh Celiscar</a>. </p><p>\"Like any program, we totally understand that you win games in the trenches,\" Golesh said. \"We needed to get some help and we were very, very picky with who we got. It's a really cool group, and the leadership from those guys has been incredible. Man, you talk about affecting a quarterback, I think we did that.\" </p><p>South Florida was able to create plenty of disruptive plays in 2025, but what's changed the most for this team is consistency. Against North Texas, it surrendered only 97 yards on the ground on 29 carries, good enough for 3.3 yards per carry. South Florida rushed for 298 yards. Perhaps more descriptively, USF's success rate was in the 95th percentile. North Texas's offensive rate sat in the 34th percentile. </p>\n<p>This has been more than a blip for South Florida during a 5-1 start. The Bulls pummeled <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/BOISE/boise-state-broncos/\">Boise State</a>, holding them to 3.2 yards per carry. They kept the chains moving in an 18-16 win against <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/FLA/florida-gators/\">Florida</a>, averaging 4.4 yards per carry. They have controlled games against some of the best in college football. </p><p>\"I told these guys last night, we have done nothing easy up to this point,\" Golesh said. \"We took the bye week and had the hardest practice we've ever had. We've attacked, we've practiced really hard.\"</p><p>After beating North Texas in a blowout, the schedule starts to clear up. There's a tough test against No. 23 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/MEMP/memphis-tigers/\">Memphis</a> on Oct. 25 that will all but clinch a spot in the American Championship Game, but even a loss there could push them through. With the overall strength of the American behind South Florida, Memphis, North Texas and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/teams/TULANE/tulane-green-wave/\">Tulane</a>, it will give them a chance to earn a trip to the postseason.</p>\n            </div>",

    "body": "\nBoth teams need a victory in NFL Week 16 when the Detroit Lions host the Pittsburgh Steelers with both teams entering Sunday at 8-6 and in danger of missing the playoffs. The Steelers are in a good position, sitting a game ahead of the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North, but they likely need to hold that spot to make the postseason. The Lions are unlikely to win their division as they are two games behind the Chicago Bears (10-4) in the NFC North and 1.5 behind the 9-4-1 Green Bay Packers, who are second in the division and hold the final playoff spot.   Kickoff from Ford Field is set for 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS and Paramount+. The Lions are 7-point favorites in the latest Steelers vs. Lions odds at DraftKings, and the over/under for total points scored is 52. Detroit's over/under for total points scored is 30.5, while Pittsburgh's is 21.5. Before you make any Lions vs. Steelers picks of your own, make sure to look at the top NFL picks from the SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times. \nWhere to watch Steelers vs. Lions on SundayWhen: Sunday, Dec. 21Time: 4:25 p.m. ETTV: CBSStream: Paramount+  Follow along: CBS Sports AppSteelers vs. Lions betting previewOdds: Lions -7, Over/Under 52Both teams are 7-7 against the spread, but Pittsburgh has covered in consecutive games and is 6-3 ATS in its past nine in December. Detroit is 10-2 in its past 12 against AFC teams. The Lions have the league's highest-scoring offense (30.6 points per game), which is why they are 9-5 to the Over, including 6-1 in their past seven. Pittsburgh is 7-7 but has scored at least 27 points in four of its past five games. The Detroit defense gives up 24.6 points per game (23rd in NFL) and Pittsburgh gives up an average of 25.4 on the road. Steelers vs. Lions SGPLions -7Jahmyr Gibbs Over 74.5 rushing yardsJared Goff Over 263.5 passing yards Bet it at DraftKings:\nModel's Steelers vs. Lions score prediction, picksThe model sees some value in taking the Steelers as plus-money underdogs on the money line, as they are winning in 35% of simulations. Detroit is covering the spread 52% of the time, and the simulations peg the score right on the number. The props model is expecting a big day for the Lions' offensive players, with Goff predicted to throw for 304 yards and Gibbs to rush for almost 91. Goff is averaging 262 yards per game but has topped this total in three of the past four and had a season-high 338 last week. Gibbs entered NFL Week 16 sixth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage and is averaging 5.5 yards per carry. He has five runs of at least 42 yards this season, so one big run could get him halfway there.Steelers vs. Lions score prediction: Lions 30, Steelers 22\nWant more Week 16 NFL picks?You've seen the model's best bets for Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Detroit Lions.

    "body": "\n        The Boston Red Sox have acquired veteran slugger Willson Contreras in a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals, reports ESPN. The Cardinals will receive righty Hunter Dobbins and minor-league pitchers Yhoiker Fajardo and Blake Aita in return, according to The Athletic. This is the second significant Cardinals/Red Sox trade this offseason; Boston sent two young pitchers to St. Louis for Sonny Gray last month.Similar to Gray, Contreras will receive an additional $1 million in guaranteed money in exchange for waiving his no-trade clause, according to the Boston Globe. He is signed through 2027 with a club option for 2028, and now has $42.5 million coming his way. The Cardinals will pay $8 million of the $42.5 million, reports MassLive. While Contreras initially showed no interest in leaving St. Louis, even in the face of the ongoing rebuild, he eventually reconsidered and waived it to approve the deal to a Red Sox club that, unlike the Cardinals, figures to contend in 2026.\n        \n            \n                Willson Contreras trade grades: Red Sox finally get their big bat, Cardinals continue clearing out veterans\n                \n                    R.J. Anderson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe trade pushes Boston's payroll into the same range as last year, meaning the the Red Sox will either have to raise payroll or shed a contract(s) to bring back third baseman Alex Bregman.Contreras, who's going into his age-34 season, is a former catcher who will likely man first base and DH for the Red Sox, as he did for the Cardinals in 2025. He gives Boston a needed middle-of-the-order righty bat and fits Fenway Park well given his above-average pulled fly ball rate. Contreras is coming off another productive season: \nThose 2025 outputs were good for a 123 OPS+ and a 2.5 WAR in 135 games. Contreras continues to back up his strong offensive production with similarly imposing batted-ball indicators. All of that suggests he's likely to continue producing at a high level for the time being. For his career, the three-time All-Star has an OPS+ of 118 and a WAR of 29.2 across parts of 10 MLB seasons. Over that same span, he's averaged 26 home runs and 31 doubles per 162 games played. Defensively, Contreras put up strong numbers last season, his first as a primary first baseman.Dobbins, 26, had a 4.13 ERA with 45 strikeouts in 61 innings in 2025, his first season in the majors. A knee injury ended his season in July, though he is expected to be ready in time for spring training. MLB Pipeline ranked Fajardo as the No. 23 prospect in Boston's system, calling him a \"potential mid-rotation starter.\" Aita was unranked. He and Fajardo both pitched in Single-A in 2025.\nBoston went 87-73 in 2025 and reached the postseason for the first time since 2021. They were eliminated by the rival New York Yankees in the Wild Card Series.\n            ",

A touchdown would give the Lions the lead with seconds remaining.Then it all fell apart: An offensive pass interference overturned an Amon-Ra St. Brown touchdown and sent the Lions back to the 11. A false start moved them back to the 16.\n        \n            \n                What happened on final play in Steelers' chaotic 29-24 road win over Lions? Making sense of dramatic ending\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nShortly thereafter, the knockout punch -- a strange and controversial one -- landed: St. Brown caught a pass at the 1-yard line and lateraled to Jared Goff, who scored as time expired. However, St. Brown had been flagged for offensive pass interference, and the heroic effort was for naught. Here's the full explanation.\nThat sequence may well be emblematic of Detroit's season as a whole.After the Chicago Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers on Saturday night, the Lions were just one game back of the Packers, who added quarterback Jordan Love (concussion) to their lengthy list of significant injuries. Instead, the Lions fell to 8-7, a result that had two significant NFC playoff implications:The Bears (11-4) clinched a playoff berth, because the Lions can no longer reach 11 wins.The San Francisco 49ers (10-4) clinched a playoff berth, because the 49ers' 8-2 conference record is better than what the Lions can possibly reach.It also narrowed Detroit's postseason path to just about the narrowest one possible. The Packers (9-5-1) remained 1.5 games up on the Lions with two games to go for both teams, meaning the Lions' only path to the playoffs is to win both of their next two games AND have the Packers lose both of their next two games.\nLions schedule: Week 17 at Vikings, Week 18 at BearsPackers schedule: Week 17 vs. Ravens, Week 18 at VikingsSportsLine projections give Detroit a 5% chance to make the postseason.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf has put himself at risk of being suspended by the NFL. At the very least, his pockets certainly will be a bit lighter.During the first half of the Steelers' Week 16 matchup against the Detroit Lions, Metcalf was seen interacting with a fan in the stands. He then threw a closed fist at the fan's face before walking away.Check out what happened, here:\nCBS rules analyst Gene Steratore explained that because this interaction took place off the field and was not seen by the officials, it could not be penalized. \"Because the officials did not see this -- and (you) wouldn't expect them to from where DK Metcalf was, it's not something they can weigh in to from an officiating standpoint. I have been notified, though, that will be delivered to compliance with the NFL, and they'll address it at that point,\" Steratore said.\nThe Detroit Free Press tracked down the fan in the stands, and asked them what they said to Metcalf and what their name was.\"What, my full name isn't is DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf,\" the fan said. \"He doesn't like his government name. I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt. I'm a little shocked. Like everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"The fan was reportedly ejected from Ford Field after the incident. Metcalf is in his first season with the Steelers after being acquired via trade from the Seattle Seahawks in March. He is Pittsburgh's leading receiver with 55 catches for 808 yards and six touchdowns, and it would be a massive loss for Aaron Rodgers & Co. if Metcalf were to be suspended for his actions. The Steelers visit the 3-12 Browns next Sunday. \nThe 8-6 Steelers find themselves in a heated AFC North battle with the 7-7 Baltimore Ravens, who host the New England Patriots this week on \"Sunday Night Football.\" The Steelers and Ravens face off in the regular-season finale in Week 18, which could be for the AFC North crown and a spot in the playoffs. \n            ",

Both teams needed a Lions loss to clinch a playoff spot and that's exactly what happened. And on Sunday night in Baltimore, the New England Patriots rallied to beat the Ravens to punch their ticket to the playoffs.The Bears, 49ers, Seahawks, Eagles and Patriots join the Broncos and Rams, who both clinched a playoff spot in Week 15. Now all eyes will be on the Monday night game, where a 49ers win over the Colts means three more AFC teams will clinch a playoff spot. \nLet's take a look at the remaining clinching scenarios for Week 16. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo Bills (11-4)Going into Week 16, the Bills had multiple scenarios for clinching a playoff berth, but now, there's just one: Buffalo will officially clinch a spot if the Colts lose to the 49ers on Monday night. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Like the Bills, the Jaguars only have one scenario left that can clinch them a playoff spot this week. After beating the Broncos on Sunday, Jacksonville now needs the Colts to lose to the 49ers on Monday night. If that happens, Jacksonville will officially clinch a playoff spot. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles Chargers (11-4) As it turns out, there will be three different teams cheering against the Colts on Monday night. The Chargers, Jaguars and Bills will all clinch a playoff spot if Indianapolis loses.  \nNOTE: The Packers can NO LONGER clinch a playoff spot in Week 16. They had two scenarios where they could have clinched this week, but they had to either beat the Bears or tie the Bears on Saturday. Instead, the Packers ended up losing, which means Green Bay will now have to wait until Week 17 at the earliest to possibly clinch a playoff spot. Let's take a look at who's in and who's out so far: 1. *Seahawks (12-3) -- NFC West leader2. *Bears (11-4) -- NFC North leader3. *Eagles (10-5) -- NFC East leader 4. Panthers (8-7) -- NFC South leader5. *Rams (11-4)6. *49ers (10-4)7. Packers (9-5-1)NFC playoff spots clinched: Rams, Eagles, Seahawks, Bears, 49ersNFC teams eliminated: Vikings, Falcons, Saints, Commanders, Cardinals, Giants, CowboysNow, let's check out the AFC: 1. *Broncos (12-3) -- AFC West leader2. *Patriots (12-3) -- AFC East leader 3. Jaguars (11-4) -- AFC South leader4. Steelers (9-6) -- AFC North leader5. Chargers (11-4)6. Bills (11-4) 7. Texans (10-5)\nAFC playoff spots clinched: Broncos, PatriotsAFC teams eliminated: Chiefs, Dolphins, Bengals, Jets, Browns, Raiders, TitansThe Cowboys were the only team that could be eliminated from playoff contention this week and that happened when the Eagles beat the Commanders. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        By virtue of Sunday's 29-24 win over the Detroit Lions, the Pittsburgh Steelers have set a new standard for excellence in the NFL. Winners of three straight games, Pittsburgh has clinched its 22nd consecutive non-losing season, an NFL record. The Steelers had previously shared the record with the Dallas Cowboys, a team that they have previously faced in three Super Bowls. The Steelers have not had a losing season since they went 6-10 in 2003. Most consecutive non-losing seasons in NFL history FranchiseSeasonsYearsChampionships won1Pittsburgh Steelers222004-Present22Dallas Cowboys 211965-8523New England Patriots 19 2001-196T4Oakland Raiders161965-802T4San Francisco 49ers 161983-9866Chicago Bears 151930-445Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has also secured his 19th consecutive non-losing season, which ties him with former Patriots coach Bill Belichick for second all time behind Tom Landry, who was the Cowboys' coach throughout the Dallas' 20-year non-losing streak. Tomlin has also extended his own record of consecutive non-losing seasons to begin a coaching career. In 2021, he broke the record that was previously held by Marty Schottenheimer. Sunday was also Tomlin's 200th career win (including the postseason). Most consecutive non-losing seasons for an NFL coach CoachSeasonsYearsChampionships1Tom Landry (Cowboys)211965-852T2Bill Belichick (Patriots)192001-196T2Mike Tomlin (Steelers)192007-Present14George Halas (Bears)161933-42; 1946-5145Marty Schottenheimer (Browns/Chiefs)141984-970The Steelers' current streak started in 2004, when they won a franchise-record 15 regular-season games. That season also saw Ben Roethlisberger win each of his first 13 career starts, an NFL record. \"It legitimized the fact that we can play with the big boys,\" former Steelers safety Troy Polamalu once said of the '04 Steelers. \"Midway through the season, we had beaten two unbeaten teams, which were Philadelphia and New England. ... Philadelphia had Terrell Owens, who was extremely talented, and Donovan McNabb. Obviously, everybody knows that Tom Brady is a pretty good quarterback as well (laughs) that we lost to (in the AFC Championship Game). \"That year was a very significant year because we [realized] we were good enough to play with everybody.\"The following season, the Steelers became the first six seed to win the Super Bowl after they defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL. That would be the second-to-last season on the sideline for Hall of Fame coach Bill Cowher, whose 15 seasons with the Steelers included tying Paul Brown's record by leading Pittsburgh to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons as coach. Pittsburgh continued its success upon Tomlin's arrival in 2007. The Steelers won the AFC North title that year before capturing the franchise's sixth Super Bowl title in 2008 after defeating the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII. In 2010, the Steelers reached the Super Bowl again before falling to Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers. In 2011, the Steelers lost to Tim Tebow and the Denver Broncos in the AFC wild-card round in what is considered one of the most shocking playoff losses in franchise history. What followed were consecutive 8-8 seasons as many of the central figures on Pittsburgh's championship teams began to depart. Behind an explosive offense, the Steelers enjoyed a successful four-year run from 2014-17 that included three division titles, four consecutive playoff berths and the franchise's most recent AFC Championship game appearance at the end of the 2016 season. In 2017, the Steelers went 13-3 before suffering another upset loss in the playoffs, this time at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars. After closing the 2010s with two non-playoff seasons, the Steelers made the playoffs four times over a five-year span from 2020-24. But while they've continued to remain competitive, Pittsburgh has yet to win a playoff game since defeating the Chiefs in the 2016 divisional round. That drought has, in some people's eyes, diminished the team's record of non-losing seasons. Here are some of the essential figures during the Steelers' recent run:Former head coach Bill CowherCurrent head coach Mike TomlinFormer general manager Kevin ColbertLate owner Dan RooneyHis son and current team president Art Rooney IIFormer defensive coordinator Dick LeBeauTwo-time Super Bowl champion Ben RoethlisbergerPro Football Hall of Fame safety and 2010 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Troy Polamalu2008 NFL Defensive Player of the Year James Harrison 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year T.J.

They are hoping to cap off the regular season with their first division title since 2020, which would lead to the franchise's first home playoff game in five years.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LONDON -- For Alexander Isak, this really might have been the moment where it all went click. Not that the 10 minutes leading up to his goal had particularly suggested that British football's record signing was on the brink of something, but there is nothing to drag a player out of a prolonged funk like a goal. All the more so given that his goal dragged Liverpool ahead in a game that they resolutely failed to impose themselves on, no matter the difficulties of Tottenham.These were the moments that you pay $175 million. They have been altogether too infrequent for Liverpool, 2-1 winners at Tottenham.Cruelly for Isak, however, they might not be much more frequent for some time yet. It was the other click that threatens to define this day. Or perhaps it was a jar, a jam or something even more heavy-duty. Whatever the nature of the damage done to Isak as Micky van de Ven collided with him well after the shot was away, it was enough to rob Liverpool's No. 9 of what might otherwise have been a moment of ecstasy. There was to be no celebration from Isak nor from his teammates. Dark and worried faces soon surrounded the Swede, who squirmed on the floor in agony, one hand covering his eyes as the other clung onto his left knee. He seemed to fear the worst.A stretcher may not have been required, but the worst fears hardly seemed allayed as Isak hobbled along the touchline at agonizing pace, his weight placed on two Liverpool physios. Suddenly, all manner of fears came crashing into view. When might Isak be back to fire life into year one at his new club? The belief is a broken leg, putting him out potentially for the next handful of months, which is a small silver lining to what potentially could have been a season-ending injury. Isn't this what any buyer would always have feared from a player whose Newcastle career was pockmarked with runs of seven or eight games on the sidelines? What of the World Cup and, indeed, the qualifiers in March, where Sweden could really do with one of the best strikers in the world? \nFor Arne Slot, it was much too soon for such doomerism, though he admitted that his gut feeling was not a positive one. \"I don't have any news on him,\" he said on Saturday. \"If a player scores and gets injured and doesn't come on the pitch and also doesn't try ... That's usually not a good thing. I cannot say anything more than that. That is just gut feeling. Nothing medical.\"I haven't spoken to him about his feeling but it's a nice thing that he scored. A good goal, assisted by Florian Wirtz.\"Slot might be intent on finding the silver lining but the story of this season seems to be that, no matter how much they spend, Liverpool cannot have nice things. Not for the first time this season, a moment of triumph was swept away in an instant. So too departed a flicker of what Slot's team might have been given more time to build the automatisms they so clearly lack.\nIsak's goal had been the moment the rest of the Premier League had feared since Martin Edwards parked the Brink's truck outside St. James' Park and came up with an offer even Saudi Arabia couldn't refuse. One clumsy moment from Cristian Romero -- the first of many -- and the ball was ricocheting off Alexis Mac Allister and into Isak's path. Smart hold-up play with his back to goal and then the No. 9 slipped the ball to Hugo Ekitike, whose first-time pass found Wirtz in stride. That long-awaited first goal contribution betrayed no nerves, a pass played at just the right moment for Isak to bend one low and across Guglielmo Vicario.\"That's what we would like to see happening a lot,\" said Slot. \"Good finish, good pass. Let's not be too negative yet. We don't know. Let's hope he's back with us soon. Difficult to say.\"This may feel like an overhype of an attack that was as much to do with how little else Liverpool offered in an attacking sense. A header from Ekitike 10 minutes after the opener gave them enough of a cushion to hold off a late charge but against 11, 10 or nine men, Liverpool never got going. It was one thing to get outshot five to one by Spurs in the period before Xavi Simons' red card; Tottenham controlled the game rather well early on. The fact that it was 10 to seven in Tottenham's favor from then on speaks as much to Liverpool's inability to exploit possession and territory as it does the late charge brought about by Richarlison's scrappy finish seven minutes from time. \nLiverpool found themselves clinging on against nine men at the death partly because football is a deeply silly sport for how low-scoring it is, somewhat because the decisions of referee John Brooks stoked an indignation in Tottenham that was worth at least one extra man and predominantly because they could not do enough with the ball. This isn't the first time they've found themselves hanging on against 10 men -- against Newcastle, they roared back in more thrilling fashion -- and it seems there is something that Slot is aware of that is making it harder for Liverpool to impose themselves on teams.\"It's always difficult. If I try to explain why it is difficult then people tell me afterwards, 'you say too much to your future opponents.'\"When we had the ball, that was what hurt me the most. In the nine minutes of added time, I think they had 95% of the ball. Every time when we had the ball, we kicked it away or we threw it away. It was unbelievable that we couldn't keep the ball a bit longer.\"\nThat feels like another problem on top of the other one that has dogged Slot for most of this season: that his team are too easily run through by counterattacking opponents. There were flashes of that, a breakaway chance for 10-man Randal Kolo Muani, but until the late drama, this had more of the feel of the Inter game, a match where Liverpool filled the center to throttle some of the drama out of proceedings. The logic to that should be that when indiscipline from the opponents allows them to apply further control, they turn that into shots and goals.Instead, the quasi-diamond of recent games was more of a lump of coal, all rough edges as Mac Allister found himself pushed up alongside Ekitike, Wirtz roaming high and low in pursuit of the ball. For this system to be effective, the fullbacks need to be at the top of their game. Conor Bradley was struggling with his radar before his injury-enforced exit at the interval and too many of Milos Kerkez's crosses crashed into the first Tottenham shirt. The left flank in particular never got going and inverting into more central areas does not seem to be the best use of Kerkez, a flyer down the line who could offer the width this team lacks too often.Such are the problems Liverpool made for themselves with their half-billion dollar overhaul of the champions, one which seems to have left them light on wingers and center backs while overstuffed with players who would be happiest in the space between midfield and the frontline. This might be a squad that needs reorienting but when you have as much talent as Slot can call upon, there is always the prospect of something clicking. Not that, however.\n            ",

He went back to the locker room with Baltimore training staffers, and after the team initially ruled him questionable to return, he was ruled out for the game late in the third quarter.Jackson, 28, took a knee to the back while going down on a run and left the field. Tyler Huntley took over for one play, and the Ravens kicked a field goal on the next snap after that to tie the game, 10-10. Huntley played the Ravens' final drive of the half as well.\nJackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries all season. He suffered a hamstring strain in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs and missed three games, returning in Week 9 against the Miami Dolphins. However, he has only had one full week of practice since then due to knee, ankle and toe ailments. He also dealt with an illness this week.Jackson's rushing production has fallen off steadily this season, especially in the wake of the hamstring injury and the injuries that followed. Entering Week 16, he is averaging 30.3 rushing yards per game this season, by far a career low. His 5.5 rushes per game are also on pace to be a career low.\nAs of Jackson's back injury, Ravens (7-7) are 1.5 games back of the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6) in the AFC North. Baltimore has a 20% chance to make the playoffs, per SportsLine.\n            \n    ",

The Chiefs specifically struggled to stay healthy this season, and that trend continued during their Week 16 showdown with the Tennessee Titans. During the first half, Gardner Minshew -- who started the game in placed of injured starter Patrick Mahomes -- sustained a knee injury that led to him being out for the remainder of the game. The Chiefs fear that Minshew tore his ACL in the loss, ESPN reports. Veteran backup Chris Oladokun replaced him and went 6 of 8 for 45 yards in the first half after Minshew went to the locker room. The Titans took a 9-6 lead into intermission before pulling away for a 26-9 win. Tennessee is now 3-11 on the year, while the Chiefs fell to 6-9. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Oladokun, 28, in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Oladokun signed three years ago after he hit waivers. His only previous regular season experience took place in Week 18 of the 2024 season. He had never thrown a pass in a regular season game prior to Sunday. \nOladokun finished the game with 111 yards on 11 of 16 passing. He was sacked four times while directing one scoring drive during the game's final 30 minutes. \nMinshew, 29, is in his first season with the Chiefs, his fourth team over the past five seasons. He earned his first Pro Bowl berth in 2023 after throwing a career-high 3,305 yards in 13 starts with the Indianapolis Colts. \nMahomes sustained a season-ending knee injuring during last week's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that knocked Kansas City out of postseason contention. This season marks the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        There are just two games remaining in the NFL regular season for the majority of the league's teams, but the 2026 NFL Draft order continues to shift. The Titans overcame a Patrick Mahomes-less Chiefs team for its third win of the season. There were several other close calls over the course of the day, as the Giants, Cardinals, Raiders and Browns were all involved in one-score games. With Las Vegas losing, it sets up a battle with the Giants for the No. 1 overall selection next weekend.There are seven teams with four wins or fewer in the NFL. The only two teams with just two wins meet next weekend. As a reminder, there are four teams -- Atlanta, Green Bay, Indianapolis and Jacksonville -- without a first-round pick in 2026 as a result of draft-day trades and the Micah Parsons and Sauce Gardner deals. \nHere is the current 2026 NFL Draft order (via Tankathon) as well as potential team needs:1. New York Giants (2-13)Projected needs: WR, CB, IOL, LB, OTWith J.J. McCarthy injured, New York had an opportunity to beat undrafted rookie Max Brosmer and the Vikings, but a Darius Slayton drop on third-and-8 proved to be the final nail in the coffin. 2. Las Vegas Raiders (2-13)Projected needs: CB, LB, S, DL, OTThe Raiders showed more life than their fans had seen in months, but the Texans pulled the plug with a clock-draining final drive that allowed Houston to kneel out the clock.\n3. Cleveland Browns (3-12)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLThe Browns were first on the scoreboard and stayed close throughout the game, but Shedeur Sanders couldn't deliver a win.4. New York Jets (3-12)Projected needs: QB, WR, DL, CB, TEThe Jets and Saints were trading field goals in the first half, but the Saints, led by rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, ultimately pulled away. 5. Tennessee Titans (3-12)Projected needs: OT, IOL, WR, DL, EDGEThere is no clarity on the future of the Titans' organization beyond Cam Ward's involvement. The team will have its third new head coach (not including interims) in four years. \n6. Arizona Cardinals (3-12)Projected needs: OT, IOL, LB, DL, RBArizona continued clawing its way back into the fight after Atlanta had delivered a few convincing blows. In the end, the Cardinals were unable to get one final stop for their offense to retake the field.7. Washington Commanders (4-11)Projected needs: EDGE, LB, CB, TE, WRWashington held a lead early in the game, but Jayden Daniels' backup, Marcus Mariota, gave way to veteran Josh Johnson and Philadelphia ran away with the game.8. New Orleans Saints (5-10)Projected needs: CB, S, DL, RB, WRNew Orleans has won its third consecutive game, and it has winnable games ahead against the Titans and Falcons.\n9. Cincinnati Bengals (5-10)Projected needs: IOL, CB, S, TE, EDGECincinnati expelled some of its frustrations on what had been a feisty Dolphins team on Sunday with a 45-21 victory.10. Miami Dolphins (6-9)Projected needs: CB, WR, TE, IOL, SAfter winning four consecutive games, Miami is now on a two-game losing streak. Mike McDaniel's seat is still hot with two games to play.  11. Los Angeles Rams via Atlanta Falcons (6-9)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLAtlanta has won two consecutive games and put a damper on the outlook of the Rams' first-round pick.\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (6-9)Projected needs: DL, RB, CB, LB, TEChiefs fans got a glimpse of what it would be like to play without Patrick Mahomes on Sunday. The offensive issues persisted, but with Gardner Minshew and Chris Oladokun at quarterback.  13. Dallas Cowboys (6-8-1)Projected needs: S, LB, EDGE, RB, CBDallas is once again falling short of expectations. Will this be the season that sets course on an off-season of drastic changes?14. Baltimore Ravens (7-8)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, IOL, TE, CBThe Ravens lost Lamar Jackson to a back injury and also lost to the Patriots on \"Sunday Night Football.\"\n15. Minnesota Vikings (7-8)Projected needs: LB, CB, S, DL, RBMinnesota is teetering on .500, but there is a clear delineation between the top teams in the conference and how the Vikings are currently playing. Unfortunately, another injury to J.J. McCarthy will hamper the evaluation process of the young quarterback. 16. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)Projected needs: LB, DL, EDGE, IOL, TEThe Buccaneers have now lost six of their past seven games, but will still have an opportunity to win the division if they take care of business against Miami next weekend. 17. Detroit Lions (8-7)Projected needs: EDGE, DL, LB, CB, OTDetroit could not afford to lose this weekend, but Pittsburgh was in a must-win scenario of its own. The Lions fell short in front of the hometown crowd.\n\n        \n            \n                2026 NFL Draft order after Week 16: Giants, Raiders losses set up a potential No. 1 pick showdown\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n18.

Cleveland Browns via Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Projected needs: OT, WR, QB, CB, IOLJacksonville is playing as well as any other team in football right now. There is a trust that has developed between Trevor Lawrence and Liam Coen over the course of the season that has enabled the offense to flourish. 28. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Projected needs: CB, OT, LB, S, IOLMatthew Stafford threw for nearly 500 yards and three touchdowns, but a two-point conversion pushed Seattle over the top in overtime. 29. Chicago Bears (11-4)Projected needs: DL, S, IOL, RB, OTAgainst all odds, Chicago has a python-like grip on the NFC North with just two games to play. 30. New England Patriots (12-3)Projected needs: OT, TE, WR, LB, EDGEThe Patriots knocked off the Ravens on \"Sunday Night Football\" to clinch a playoff berth.31. Denver Broncos (12-3)Projected needs: LB, TE, S, WR, OTAn 11-game win streak was brought to an end by Jacksonville Sunday evening.

    "body": "\n        There has been no shortage of drama in Week 16. Before we even got to Sunday's action, we had a trio of games that reshaped the playoff picture, particularly in the NFC. There were comebacks by both the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears, who sit as the top two seeds in the conference, while the Philadelphia Eagles locked in their place as the NFC East champions for the second year in a row. As expected, given the time of year, the latest playoff seeding scenarios are at the top of mind throughout the NFL. However, there are also plenty of storylines developing across the league that don't exactly link back to the postseason picture. For instance, the Kansas City Chiefs are finding out that life without Patrick Mahomes is awfully difficult, while the Miami Dolphins are potentially ushering in a new era under center. As we do every week, we're going to dive into some of the more noteworthy storylines to sprout up over Week 16 and determine which ones we should take seriously and which others are mere overreactions. Quinn Ewers era already over in MiamiOverreaction vs. reality: RealityOne of the bigger non-playoff storylines coming into Week 16 was the Miami Dolphins benching of Tua Tagovailoa and starting rookie Quinn Ewers at quarterback. While this change under center had more to do with Tagovailoa, it was an opportunity for Ewers to state his case as the possible heir apparent for the organization as it looks toward 2026. While it's only one start that's under his belt, it wasn't exactly a confidence-instilling performance by the Texas product. \nEwers finished his first career start, completing 20 of his 30 passes for 260 yards and two interceptions in what was a blowout loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. The second half was where Ewers truly started to falter, completing 55.6% of his throws and two interceptions to result in a 43.8 passer rating. \nEwers will likely get the start over Miami's final two games to wrap up the season, but the initial optimism of him rising atop the depth chart has certainly hit a sobering wall. Through the first test, Ewers didn't do enough to force Miami's hand to forgo looking at other options this coming offseason.Jaxson Dart no longer Giants clear-cut QB of the futureOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionIt was a bizarre day for the New York Giants offense as it fell to the Minnesota Vikings, 16-13. While that final score illustrates a close game, the offense didn't provide much, as the only touchdown on the afternoon for New York came on the defensive side. Overall, the offense registered just 141 yards of offense on 2.9 yards per play. \nSpecifically, it was a quiet afternoon for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, who only attempted five passes in the first half and completed one of them for 2 yards. For the game, Dart was 7 of 13 for 33 yards and an interception, which gave him a 27.4 passer rating. It was truly an awful performance all the way around. While that may shake the confidence in some regarding Dart's standing as the organization's centerpiece under center, it shouldn't. There is so much going wrong with the Giants, ranging from an ill-equipped offensive line, injured pass catchers, and an interim head coach, that it's hard to truly evaluate him. \nDart has flashed enough this season that any serious head coaching candidate this cycle can look at him and see someone whom they can mold into a true franchise quarterback. \nChiefs loss shows how much Patrick Mahomes was carrying team Overreaction vs. reality: RealityThe Kansas City Chiefs had another quarterback go down on Sunday, with Gardner Minshew leaving due to a knee injury, so the organization was truly playing with both arms tied behind its back offensively. That said, when watching them fall to the Tennessee Titans, it exposed how much Patrick Mahomes was propping this roster up. With the face of the franchise out for the year due to a torn ACL, we saw the warts that this roster has. The offensive line struggles in pass protection, there are no true receiving threats (albeit with Rashee Rice injured for this game), and the defense just saw one of the worst offenses in the league move the ball at will for most of the afternoon. These final two weeks should be a wake-up call to the front office that, as generational as Mahomes is, he needs at least some talent at his disposal to get them back to the mountaintop.\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: 49ers, Bears and Patriots punch their tickets; Panthers seize NFC South lead\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPanthers are going to run away with the NFC SouthOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionCarolina pulled off a massive win in Week 16 over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The victory vaulted them to first place in the NFC South as they sit as the No. 7 seed in the conference with just two weeks left in the regular season. \nAs much as this win gives them an inside lane to eventually being named NFC South champions, it's a step too far to say that they are not going to run away with the division. Yes, if Carolina wins out, they'll clinch the division, but the road ahead is hardly easy. Next week, they'll host the Seattle Seahawks, who are currently the No. 1 seed in the NFC, before heading on the road to Raymond James Stadium, where they'll again play the Buccaneers. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay's Week 17 opponent is far easier in the Miami Dolphins, albeit with that game being on the road. This division is still very much up in the air. \nBills run defense will be their undoing in the playoffs Overreaction vs. reality: RealityIt didn't burn them on Sunday as they were able to escape Cleveland with a win over the Browns, but the Buffalo Bills run defense is a massive problem that could prove to be their undoing when they get into the playoffs. In a game where Quinshon Judkins left early due to an injury, Cleveland still was able to rush for 160 yards on 5.2 yards per carry, which helped firmly put the Bills on upset alert. This isn't a one-week issue for the unit either, as it has been among the worst run defenses in the league all season. Coming into Week 16, Buffalo was giving up the third most rushing yards per game (143.1) on a 5.4 yards per carry allowed average that was the second highest in the league. With various playoff teams featuring a strong rushing attack, this could be their kryptonite.Detroit's Super Bowl window has closedOverreaction vs. reality: OverreactionThe Lions likely just saw their hopes of sneaking into the playoffs go up in smoke as they came up just short of mounting a comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Detroit is now 8-7 and the No. 8 seed in the conference, but trails the No. 7 seed Packers (9-5-1) by a large margin when factoring in Green Bay owning the head-to-head tiebreaker. \nWith their postseason dreams likely dashed, the next question is whether or not the Lions have missed their Super Bowl window. The division is getting tougher by the year, so it'll be a harder road for Dan Campbell's club, but there is too much talent to completely close the door on the Lions getting to the big game in the years to come. If they get healthy and make some additions this offseason, they could quickly return as one of the elite teams in the conference. Jaguars are the team to beat in the AFCOverreaction vs. reality: RealityJacksonville has its marquee win of the season, rolling into Denver and taking down the Broncos, who are currently sitting as the No. 1 seed. This was a much-needed victory for the Jags as it begins to validate what has been a stellar run over this six-game winning streak. \nPrior to Sunday, Jacksonville had largely beaten up bad competition, which opened the door for those looking at the organization to doubt whether or not the Jaguars are for real. Well, it's hard to argue that now, as they took down arguably the best team in the conference in their building in rather convincing fashion. Coming out of Week 16, you can make a strong case that these Jaguars are the cream of the crop in the AFC. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        A high-stakes batch of festive fixtures awaits the Premier League's teams, many of them in the hunt for much-needed points as they approach the business end of the campaign.Arsenal remain the oddsmakers' choice to win the title and Manchester City have provided a real challenge so far, but unpredictability has been the theme of the season so far. This season has had its fair share of surprises, from Sunderland's rise up the table to Liverpool's fall from grace a few short months after winning the Premier League title. This weekend's action was no exception – the Reds were unimpressive despite beating Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, while Aston Villa stayed in third place as Morgan Rogers' individual brilliance led them to a 2-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday despite the Red Devils' impressive turnaround this season.Christmas, as a result, serves as a fascinating check-in on each of the top flight's 20 teams as a competitive race for the title and top four spots – and as the top relegation contenders take on the uphill battle of escaping the bottom three. Here's a look at how each team has fared so far this season before the Premier League's busy holiday stretch.1. Arsenal (39 points)Arsenal have become regular contenders in recent years but things really seem to be trending in the right direction this time around and heading into Christmas, they remain the team to beat. The difference this season seems to be their deep squad, which has allowed the team to withstand injury issues and Viktor Gyokeres' underwhelming start to life in the Premier League. A two point gap may make Manchester City a little too close for comfort but there are few complaints to make about the Gunners' work so far, their strong start to the campaign is undeniable. Grade: A\n2. Manchester City (37 points)Manchester City very clearly entered the season in rebuild mode, a natural result of the previous campaign's slide to third place after winning four successive titles. They have been obviously imperfect and appear overly reliant on Erling Haaland and yet … they have thrust themselves into the title race. It may feel a little bit like a fluke, which raises a ton of questions about whether or not they can keep this up, but they deserve credit for finding a way to win time and time again, no matter how unlikely those victories have seemed. This grade, though, should not be confused for a prediction of what's to come – this version of Pep Guardiola's team does not look close to the finished product just yet. Grade: A3. Aston Villa (36 points)Aston Villa may have had some fortune on their side this season but they probably do not care all that much, sitting in third place heading into Christmas. Unai Emery's side ranks 15th in the Premier League for expected goal differential and have overperformed their expected goals tally considerably with 27 goals from 18.1 expected goals. They have also benefited greatly from Morgan Rogers' impressive run of form, the England international now boasting 10 goal contributions in his last 12 league games. It is worth asking if this approach is sustainable but their strong start probably means they have done enough to stay in the conversation for a berth in next season's edition of the UEFA Champions League, which is undoubtedly an improvement from a year ago. Grade: B+4. Chelsea 29 pointsIt has been a weird season for Chelsea, who are probably right where they should be in fourth place but have almost dragged themselves there in the process. Cole Palmer has spent much of the season injured and their attacking output has gone out the window in the process, all while making matters worse for themselves by picking up red cards at a shockingly high rate. Combine that with the fact that manager Enzo Maresca declared that he recently experienced his worst 48 hours at the club but would not explain why, it would be hard to say things are going wonderfully at Stamford Bridge. Grade: B\n5. Liverpool (29 points)In the span of a few short months, Liverpool have gone from the Premier League champions to the top flight's crisis team. Mohamed Salah's impressive form that anchored their title campaign is nowhere to be seen but more worryingly, manager Arne Slot has not found a way to build cohesion amongst his many attacking talents, the Reds' ability to compete hampered in the process. Take Saturday's 2-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur as an example – they had a man advantage for an hour after Xavi Simons' 33rd-minute red card but Spurs outshot them 15 to eight and outdid them with 1.07 expected goals to 0.66. Grade: D6. Sunderland (27 points)Aston Villa may be fortunate to be as high as they are but the luckiest team in the league this season just might be Sunderland, who rank 17th for expected goal differential but have racked up the types of results that make relegation difficult to imagine. They have overperformed their actual output in just about every category, leading with their defensive stability. Only Arsenal and Manchester City have conceded fewer goals than them so far this season, outdoing just about every realistic expectation newly promoted teams face in the process. The other shoe may drop at some point but staying up is essentially a pass-fail task and Sunderland are passing with flying colors, in that sense. Grade: A7. Manchester United (26 points)It may have felt unlikely at the start of the season but at long last, Manchester United have found some stability. Ruben Amorim's side have sneakily been one of the Premier League's best attacking teams all season with 31 goals, a tally only bettered by Erling Haaland-led Manchester City, and sit just three points outside of the top four heading into Christmas. It makes for a rapid transformation from last season's 15th-place finish, quietly making them one of the stories of the season so far. Grade: A+\n8. Crystal Palace (26 points)Things keep trending upwards for Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner, who have followed up their first-ever trophy with their first European campaign and a spot in the Premier League's top half at Christmas. They rank fourth for expected goal differential in the league and are amongst England's better defensive teams, on track to climb out of their personal purgatory of 12th place in the process. There is a little room for improvement for Palace, though – they have scored just 21 goals despite generating 28.24 expected goals in 17 games, which is why they sit a little lower in the table than the statistics suggest they should. Grade: A-9. Brighton and Hove Albion (24 points)Ninth place is a very respectable place for Brighton and Hove Albion to land at Christmas, but it is not exactly groundbreaking. They are performing roughly the same as they were this time a year ago, the club clearly in a holding pattern as one of the better midtable Premier League teams. There are worse fates than that but at this stage in the season, there is not much to write home about. Grade: B10. Everton (24 points)Relegation is not really on Everton's radar this season, a welcome departure from some recent seasons, but David Moyes' side seems destined for a midtable finish this season. It is probably a nice little injection of stability for a club that has needed it and only adds to the feeling that the Toffees have entered a new chapter, especially with the opening of Hill Dickinson Stadium. That is probably the only big takeaway, though, for an otherwise insignificant Everton season so far. Grade: B\n11. Newcastle United (23 points)Things have not gone according to plan for Newcastle United, who have lost their defensive resolve and slipped down to 11th place as a result. They seem to be happy with Nick Woltemade's seven goals to start his first Premier League season but he is no genuine replacement for Alexander Isak, though the Sweden international's departure is not the Magpies' only issue this season. Eddie Howe's side are a bit underwhelming and disappointing, a far cry from the team that finished fifth last season and were one of England's best teams for long stretches of the campaign. Grade: D12. Brentford (23 points)Brentford have not really missed a beat despite some high-profile departures over the summer, again proving themselves to be a modern example of how newly promoted clubs can transition into becoming Premier League regulars. The highlight of the campaign has been Igor Thiago, who has 11 goals so far this season and ranks only behind Erling Haaland in that category. Grade: B13. Tottenham Hotspur (22 points)Tottenham Hotspur are a little hard to judge since they are technically doing better than they were last season, when they notched a 17th-place finish. There's an argument to be made, though, that the standard should be much, much higher and that Thomas Frank's overly conservative strategy has not helped matters. Spurs have, at times, appeared allergic to taking shots and have not actually been strong in defense to make up the difference. There may be positives to take from their performance against Liverpool on Saturday, the players eventually playing with enough freedom to muster together a better attacking performance than the Reds, but only if Frank is willing to learn those lessons. Grade: D\n14. Bournemouth (22 points)Bournemouth have impressive qualities but have yet to demonstrate an ability to take a leap out of midtable mediocrity just yet, which may pave the way for an unmemorable season in some ways. Antoine Semenyo has been a real highlight, though, with eight goals and three assists so far this campaign. Grade: B-15. Fulham (20 points)Fulham are another one of those teams that have not changed much over the last year, keeping them just far enough from the drop zone but providing few other noteworthy moments along the way. Another midtable finish seems likely, though the return of U.S. men's national team defender Antonee Robinson after a long spell on the sidelines could improve things in the second half of the season. Grade: C16. Leeds United (19 points)Leeds United look more like a realistic version of the best-case scenario for a newly promoted side, entering Christmas six points clear of the relegation zone. They are probably a lot lower than they would like to be based on their performances – they rank inside the Premier League's top 10 for goals and expected goals but have been leaky at the back, conceding 31 goals despite posting 24.63 expected goals against. It's been a mixed bag for Leeds as a result but a path to staying up is not hard to envision, which should count for something. Grade: B\n17. Nottingham Forest (18 points)Last season's form to clinch a seventh-place finish was clearly fleeting since Forest are now back in the relegation mix in the midst of a chaotic season. They are now on their third manager of the campaign, Sean Dyche, succeeding Ange Postecoglou and Nuno Espirito Santo before him, but a variety of stylistic approaches have not helped Forest all that much. There are few redeeming qualities, too – a look at the underlying statistics demonstrates that they are midtable at best, the grueling tone of this campaign is ultimately an accurate one. Grade: D18. West Ham United (13 points)West Ham United are technically supposed to be better than this but the writing has been on the wall since the summer so their spot in the relegation zone comes as little surprise at this point. A great escape is not impossible with 19 games to go but years of poor squad building make them look a lot like a team that deserves to go down – they are not stacked with players with game-changing abilities, nor do they have any sort of cohesion to string together a few important wins. Grade: F19. Burnley (11 points)Burnley have earned the tag of most archetypal promoted team this season, dead last or close enough in just about every statistical category worth paying attention to. It does not help that their promotion campaign was built on an overreliance on goalkeeper James Trafford, who now sits on Manchester City's bench. If West Ham seem doomed, Burnley have it worse in every sense, a ticket back to the Championship feeling fairly certain even at Christmastime. Grade: F\n20. Wolverhampton Wanderers (two points)Heading into Christmas, Wolverhampton Wanderers are on course to be the worst-ever team in the Premier League's history. They are on course to win just 4.47 points by season's end – even if one rounded that total up to five for generosity's sake, they would still be six points short of the Derby County team that won just 11 points in the 2007-08 season. Never has a failing grade been so easy to dole out, the race to break all the wrong records now well and truly underway. Grade: F\n            ",

    "body": "\n        We've reached Week 16, so some teams are clinching playoff spots, some are aiming to stave off elimination and others are just playing out the string while keeping one eye on the NFL Draft order. And, of course, at this stage of the season, injuries are piling up for some teams while others are getting healthier. For bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 16, here are the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. Chargers at Cowboys (1 p.m. ET)LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, available)DAL CB DaRon Bland (foot, out)\nThe Chargers have Johnston for this matchup against Dallas' struggling secondary, which will likely be without cornerback DaRon Bland for the remainder of the year. The good news for the Cowboys is neither CeeDee Lamb or Javonte Williams carry injury designations for Week 16.The Cowboys are slight 1.5-point favorites at home. The total is 49.5.Vikings at Giants (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note \nBoth teams are just trying to get across the finish line here, with the Vikings taking a major step back from last season while the Giants are going to have a new head coach in 2026. The Giants have a handful of players out or questionable, but no real line-movers.Minnesota is a 2.5-point favorite. The total is 43.5.Bengals at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, available)\nThis matchup is most noteworthy for Quinn Ewers starting at quarterback for Miami in place of the benched Tua Tagovailoa as the rookie from Texas is set to make his first NFL start against Cincinnati's league-worst defense. The Bengals do have Tee Higgins back on offense after he cleared concussion protocol.\nCincy is a 4.5-point favorite, and the total is 47.5.Buccaneers at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThis very important NFC South clash thankfully doesn't have major injuries impacting it, as the Bucs have no players listed while none of Carolina's stars, namely receiver Tetairoa McMillan, carry designations into the weekend. Both teams are 7-7, so the winner will hold the NFC South lead entering Week 17. These teams face off again in Week 18. Tampa Bay is favored by three points. The total sits at 45.5.Jets at Saints (1 p.m. ET)NYJ Tyrod Taylor (groin and knee, available)NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, out)NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)NYJ WR Garrett Wilson (knee, out for season)NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)\nUndrafted rookie Brady Cook will start for New York and Tyrod Taylor will be his backup. Fields is out. Cook won't have two of New York's top weapons with receiver Garrett Wilson shut down for the year while rookie tight end Mason Taylor remains sidelined with a neck injury. As for New Orleans, the Saints are again without top running back Alvin Kamara. The Saints are 6.5-point favorites. The total is 40.5.Bills at Browns (1 p.m. ET)CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, out)CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)\nThe biggest injuries here come with Cleveland's offense, as rookie No. 2 back Dylan Sampson remains sidelined with a hand injury and veteran tight end David Njoku, who has seen his role diminish with the emergence of rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is also out. \nBuffalo is a 10.5-point favorite, and the total is 41.5.Chiefs at Titans (1 p.m. ET)KC QB Patrick Mahomes (knee, out for season)KC WR Rashee Rice (concussion, out)\nThe Chiefs are eliminated from playoff contention and will be without Patrick Mahomes for the rest of the year after he tore his ACL last week. Gardner Minshew will start in his place, but for this week, he won't have No. 1 receiver Rashee Rice as he is out with a concussion for this matchup with the Titans.Kansas City is favored by 3, and the total is 37.5.Jaguars at Broncos (4:05 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nThis AFC clash between division leaders is a potential playoff preview. The Jags have won five in a row to move to 10-4, while Denver sits atop the conference at 12-2 amid an 11-game win streak. Denver has clinched a playoff spot already while Jacksonville can clinch with a win and a loss by either Indianapolis or Houston. Denver is favored by 3.5 while the total is 47.5.Falcons at Cardinals (4:05 p.m. ET)ATL WR Drake London (knee, available)AZ RB Zonovan Knight (ankle, injured reserve)AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, available)\nAtlanta gets star receiver Drake London back after he's been sidelined for weeks with a knee injury. The Cardinals get a top receiver back in Marvin Harrison Jr., who is active after missing time of late after undergoing an appendectomy and more recently a nagging heel injury. The Cardinals' running back woes also continue, as Zonovan \"Bam\" Knight is now the third back the team has lost for the year due to injury, so Michael Carter will be Arizona's lead back on Sunday. \nThe Falcons are favored at -3. The total sits at 48.5.Raiders at Texans (4:25 p.m. ET)LV QB Geno Smith (shoulder, will play)HOU RB Woody Marks (ankle, out) HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, available)\nThe Raiders will get their starting quarterback back for this tough matchup with Houston as Geno Smith returns after missing last week's loss. The Texans' backfield will have a new leader, as Marks is out but Chubb is in. Jawhar Jordan is expected to have a big role after rushing for 101 yards on 15 carries against Arizona.Houston is a 14.5-point favorite. The total is 37.5.Steelers at Lions (4:25 p.m. ET)PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)DET OL Taylor Decker (available) and Graham Glasnow (out)\nThis is a big one for both sides, with the Steelers holding a slim one-game lead over Baltimore in the AFC North race while Detroit is trying to keep pace in the NFC wild card picture. The Steelers will again be without star edge rusher T.J. Watt after he had surgery to repair a collapsed lung last week. The Lions have listed two of their five starting offensive linemen as questionable. The Lions are favored by seven points. The total is 52.5.Patriots at Ravens (8:20 p.m. ET)No major injuries of note\nSunday Night Football is a big one for the AFC playoff picture with the Ravens hosting the Patriots. New England fell to Buffalo last week and at 11-3 leads the AFC East but is behind Denver in the race for the No. 1 seed in the conference. The Ravens are 7-7 and are a game behind the Steelers in the AFC North race and desperately need a win to keep pace. The Pats can clinch a postseason berth with a win or if either Houston or Indianapolis lose this week. \nThe Ravens are -3 on the spread with the total set at 49.5.49ers at Colts (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, TBD)IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, TBD)IND WR Alec Pierce (Achilles, TBD)\nFinal reports for Monday Night Football will come out on Saturday, but the three injuries worth watching are all in the passing game. Ricky Pearsall remains banged up and could be in danger of missing Monday's game for the 49ers, while the Colts are hoping for good news on top cornerback Sauce Gardner and deep-threat receiver Alec Pierce. The 49ers are favored by 5.5. The total is 46.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Week 16 is one of the highest-leverage weeks of the 2025 NFL season, and there have already been results with huge playoff implications. Leading up to Sunday's action, there was plenty of jockeying, particularly in the NFC. The Seahawks beat the Rams to move atop the division and the NFC on Thursday night, and Saturday's action saw the Philadelphia Eagles clinch the NFC East with a win over the Commanders, while the Chicago Bears pulled off a comeback for the ages and took control of the NFC North with an overtime victory over the Green Bay Packers. That was quite the appetizer for the full Sunday slate, which has had its fair share of drama as well. In the early window, the Carolina Panthers notched a key win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to move into first place in the NFC South. Meanwhile, in the AFC, the Buffalo Bills escaped with a win in Cleveland to keep their hopes of winning the AFC East alive. As we migrated to the later afternoon slate, the playoff picture continued to get turned on its head. The Jacksonville Jaguars took down the Denver Broncos to keep the door to the No. 1 seed ajar as the Steelers held on against the Lions, dwindling Detroit's chances of sneaking in. And there's still more to go as Monday's matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts have plenty of playoff implications. As we continue to monitor the latest movements in the playoff standings, here is an up-to-date look at where things stand heading into \"Monday Night Football.\" \nAFC standingsx-Denver Broncos (12-3)x-New England Patriots (12-3)Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)Buffalo Bills (11-4)Houston Texans (10-5)x-clinched playoff berth\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Denver Broncos (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Chiefs, vs. ChargersDenver's 11-game winning streak was snapped in Week 16 as the Jaguars rolled into Mile High and pulled off a convincing 34-20 win. While the Broncos are still the No. 1 seed in the conference and in first place in the AFC West, the door is now open slightly for them to fall from that perch if they aren't careful over these next two weeks. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New England Patriots (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Jets, vs. DolphinsThe Patriots secured their spot in the playoffs after rallying for an 11-point deficit against the Ravens to move to 12-3 on the season. The victory not only clinched their spot in the postseason, but it continued to keep the Bills at arms length for first place in the AFC East. New England loses the tiebreaker to Denver for the No. 1 seed at the moment due to a subpar win percentage in common games. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. TitansThe Jaguars made a statement in Week 16 that they are a serious player in the AFC playoff race after beating the Broncos on the road. That extends Jacksonville's winning streak to six games, as the Jaguars seem to be peaking at the right time. The Jags will clinch a playoff berth if the Colts lose to the 49ers on Monday night. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)Remaining schedule: at Browns, vs. RavensThe Steelers have won three straight and continue to give themselves breathing room in the AFC North playoff race, especially after taking down the Lions. On top of that, the Ravens fell to the Patriots, which means the only way Baltimore can leapfrog them is if they win out and Pittsburgh loses out. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Texans, at BroncosThe Chargers have now won four straight games after taking down the Cowboys in Dallas on Sunday. Currently, they are the top wild card in the AFC, but have some stiff competition behind them. That includes the Houston Texans, who they'll see next week at SoFi Stadium. The Chargers will clinch a playoff berth if the Colts lost to the 49ers on Monday night. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Buffalo Bills (11-4)Remaining schedule: vs. Eagles, vs. JetsIt was a bit closer than they may have liked, but the Bills came away with a win in Cleveland to push them to 11-4 on the season. That keeps them on the heels of the Patriots in the AFC East race and firmly in wild card position. Week 16 was the final time Buffalo will be on the road during the 2025 regular season, as they'll wrap up the year at Highmark Stadium. Meanwhile, if the Colts lose or tie on Monday night, Buffalo will have clinched a playoff berth. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Houston Texans (10-5)Remaining schedule: at Chargers, vs. ColtsAfter starting the year 0-3, the Texans have won seven straight games to put themselves in a comfortable position inside the playoff picture. Houston extended that winning streak with a victory over the Raiders at home that was much closer than anticipated, but they are knocking on the door of clinching. In the huntThe Colts (8-6) are mathematically still in the hunt, but have a difficult road forward as they take on the San Francisco 49ers on Monday night. The Ravens (7-8) saw a massive dent get put into their playoff hopes with their loss to the Patriots in Week 16. Baltimore's only path to the playoffs is via the AFC North, which they can win if Pittsburgh loses out and they win out. \nNFC standingsx-Seattle Seahawks (12-3)x-Chicago Bears (11-4)z-Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)Carolina Panthers (8-7)x-Los Angeles Rams (11-4)x-San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)x-clinched playoff berth; z-clinched division  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Seattle Seahawks (12-3)Remaining schedule: at Panthers, at 49ersSeattle pulled off an incredible, come-from-behind win over the Rams on \"Thursday Night Football,\" elevating itself to the No. 1 seed in the conference in the process. If the Seahawks win out against the Panthers and Niners, they will clinch the top spot in the NFC and a bye in the first round of the playoffs. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Chicago Bears (11-4)Remaining schedule: at 49ers, vs. LionsThe Bears are coming off a stunning comeback win over the Packers in Week 16, and they remain in the hunt for the NFC's No. 1 seed. Thanks to the Pittsburgh Steelers taking down the Detroit Lions on Sunday, Chicago has officially clinched a playoff berth, but the division is still yet to be clinched.   \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)Remaining schedule: at Bills, vs. CommandersPhiladelphia punched its playoff ticket on Saturday night with a commanding victory over the Washington Commanders. The defending Super Bowl champions become the first team to win back-to-back NFC East crowns since 2004.\nThe Eagles' win also eliminated the Cowboys from playoff contention, marking the second straight season they'll miss the postseason.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Carolina Panthers (8-7)Remaining schedule: vs. Seahawks, at BuccaneersCarolina has jumped up to the No. 4 seed after leaping over the Buccaneers for the NFC South lead thanks to a head-to-head victory in Week 16. While this does vault the Panthers atop the division for the moment, there's still plenty that can happen between now and the end of the regular season, especially with another matchup on deck for Week 18 in Tampa. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)Remaining schedule: at Falcons, vs. CardinalsThe Rams are still a playoff lock thanks to their win in Week 15, but their chances of winning the NFC West and claiming the No. 1 seed in the conference were dramatically reduced by their loss to the Seahawks on Thursday night. They need Seattle to lose at least one more game, but also can't have the 49ers win out. Otherwise, San Francisco would be the top seed in the conference by virtue of having the best division record among the three teams. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. San Francisco 49ers (10-4)Remaining schedule: at Colts, vs. Bears, vs. SeahawksThe Niners are quietly lurking in the NFC playoff race, and just clinched a playoff berth after the Lions fell to the Steelers. Despite being the No. 6 seed, San Francisco is 10-4 and ready to pounce if its division rivals slip up down the stretch. The team split the head-to-head series with the Rams, but does currently have the advantage over Seattle, which the 49ers face again in Week 18. Following L.A.'s loss to Seattle on Thursday night, the Niners control their own destiny in the race for the No. 1 seed in the conference. If they win out, they get the top spot. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)Remaining schedule: vs. Ravens, at VikingsGreen Bay saw a considerable fall from grace entering Week 16. After coming into Week 15 as the No. 2 seed and leading the NFC North, the Packers dropped all the way to the No. 7 seed following a loss to the Denver Broncos. That defeat allowed Chicago to jump ahead of Green Bay for first place in the division.\nThings got even worse Saturday night. Not only did Green Bay give up a double-digit lead in the final two minutes -- eventually falling in overtime to the Bears -- but it also lost Jordan Love to a concussion.Luckily for the Packers, they hold the tiebreaker over the Lions, their primary competition for a playoff spot, after sweeping Detroit earlier this season. Still, with games remaining against the Ravens and Vikings, it's far from a foregone conclusion that Green Bay will reach the postseason.In the huntThe Lions (8-7) have their backs against the wall after falling to the Steelers in Week 16. They already had an uphill climb coming into this slate, particularly as they are on the wrong end of the head-to-head tiebreaker against the Packers. To reach the postseason, the Lions need to win out and hope the Packers lose out. \nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8) have fallen out of first place in the NFC South after falling to the Panthers on Sunday. The only path for Baker Mayfield and Co. to make the playoffs at this point is to win the division, so there is zero margin for error over these final two weeks. They'll need to take care of business next week in Miami against the Dolphins before hosting the Panthers in what could be a win-and-in scenario in Week 18. \n            ",

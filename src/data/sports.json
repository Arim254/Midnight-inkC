The Bucks are home against the Knicks with both teams entering with 2-1 records, yet Milwaukee is the underdog. The model recommends taking the 1.5 points on the Bucks to back Milwaukee in its Tuesday best bets at DraftKings.

The model likes the value on the Blue Jays at +1.5 again on Tuesday, as Toronto has covered the number in two of three games despite the Dodgers leading the series, 2-1. Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to start for the Dodgers, but he was seen wincing while running the bases late on Monday, so he could be less than 100%. The Blue Jays are starting Shane Bieber, who has allowed just two earned runs in each of his three postseason starts. Given the importance of this game to even up the series, the model expects a strong showing from the Blue Jays on Monday, predicting them to cover as +1.5 underdogs in 67% of simulations. Back the Blue Jays at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Bucks (+1.5) vs. Knicks (-108)It's been a streaky history between the Knicks and Bucks over recent years, and the Bucks hope to start a new streak on Tuesday. The Knicks have won five straight head-to-head matchups, including all three last season, but before the current streak, the Bucks won nine straight against New York. The Bucks are 4-2 over their last six home games against New York, and they'll be the hosts on Tuesday. Giannis Antetokounmpo has scored at least 24 points in seven straight games against the Knicks, and he's off to a dominating start, averaging 36 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists to begin this season. Both the Knicks and Bucks are 2-1 this season, so with Milwaukee getting points at home, the model is leaning that way. The model projects the Bucks to cover the spread in 54% of simulations. Back the Bucks at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:James Madison vs. Texas State: Over 55.5 total points scored (-112)James Madison is coming off a nine-touchdown, 63-point performance in a 63-27 win over Old Dominion on Oct. 18, and the model expects the Dukes' offense to carry over that success into Tuesday night. Outside of taking knees to run out the clock on the final possession, James Madison scored a touchdown on nine of 13 drives in its last game. Alonza Barnett III had 448 combined passing and rushing yards with six touchdowns in the victory. Also, Texas State's recent results signal a high likelihood of the Over hitting even more than James Madison's last game. The last three Texas State games have featured an average of 75.7 combined points, with all three games totaling at least 61 points. The model projects the Over to hit in 70% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Tuesday World Series, NBA, college football picks?You've seen the model's Tuesday best bets.

    "body": "\n        If the Kentucky Derby is horse racing's Super Bowl, then the Breeders' Cup is horse racing's Olympics.The Breeders' Cup annually attracts many of the best horses from around the world to compete in 14 different events -- everything from the $1 million five-furlong Juvenile Turf Sprint for 2-year-olds on the grass to North America's richest race: the $7 million Classic for 3-year-olds and up at 1¼ miles on the dirt.  This year's Breeder's Cup, which will be held Friday and Saturday at Del Mar just north of San Diego, has brought more than 170 horses from 13 countries, including England, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Chile and, of course, the United States. The lineup is led by Sovereignty, the regal Kentucky Derby, Belmont Stakes and Travers Stakes winner who will be looking to clinch Horse of the Year honors with a win in the Classic. The horse, however, developed a temperature on Monday night, and his status for the race is up in the air.Then there's Minnie Hauk, a 3-year-old filly from Europe who came within a whisker of winning the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France and will be facing older males in the $5 million Turf. Among those she will have to beat is Rebel's Romance, who will attempt to become just the third horse to win in three different Breeders' Cups.\nBut those aren't the only horses who will be worth watching at the Breeders' Cup. SportsLine horse racing expert and microshare horse owner Jeff Hochman will be at Del Mar for the Breeders' Cup and has identified seven must-watch horses for Saturday. From an ultimate underdog to a hometown hero, these four-legged animals have stories that go beyond their ability to run fast.Note: These are Hochman's seven horses to watch, not necessarily seven horses to bet. Hochman's Breeders' Cup Classic picks are available at SportsLine for subscribers. Straight No Chaser (Sprint)Defending Sprint champion returnsThe 6-year-old colt by Speightster returns to Del Mar with unfinished business: defending his crown in the Breeders' Cup Sprint after capturing both the 2024 Eclipse Award as Champion Male Sprinter and last year's Santa Anita Sprint in commanding fashion. After his championship season, he journeyed halfway across the globe to Saudi Arabia, where he dominated the Riyadh Dirt Sprint at King Abdulaziz Racecourse in February 2025, securing an automatic berth back to the Breeders' Cup Sprint.\nThough he finished third as the favorite in September's Santa Anita Sprint Championship, Straight No Chaser has been training exceptionally well for the Breeders' Cup. His four-furlong workout in 47.20 was the best of 72 at Santa Anita, prompting trainer Dan Blacker to declare, \"He worked really well. We're on target for the Breeders' Cup.\" This will be the last race of his career, as the ownership group has already agreed with WinStar Farms to retire him to stud after this event. This makes Straight No Chaser an exciting athlete, and thousands of fans will cheer for him to win his final career race at his hometown track.Seismic Beauty (Distaff)Del Mar's hometown heroSeismic Beauty has truly transformed into an impressive two-turn filly. After her connections decided to stretch her out in distance, she has won three races in a row, each more convincing than the last. Her most recent triumph was in the Grade 1 Clement L. Hirsch Stakes at Del Mar in August, in which she showcased her dominance. She's now 3-for-3 lifetime at the seaside oval. The familiarity with Del Mar provides psychological and physical advantages that shouldn't be underestimated in a race of this magnitude. The recent defections from the Distaff field make Seismic Beauty even more formidable. Several esteemed older mares have opted for different targets, resulting in a race that will likely make her the betting favorite.The way she bolts to the front right from the start creates such thrilling moments, and you can't help but feel the tension as she dares the competition to keep up with her all the way down the Del Mar stretch, which is the shortest in the country.\nRebel's Romance (Turf)Chasing historic third Turf titleIf any horse embodies the globetrotting spirit and international prestige of the Breeders' Cup, it's Godolphin's magnificent Rebel's Romance. The 7-year-old Dubawi gelding returns to Del Mar with an opportunity to make history: becoming the first horse to win the Breeders' Cup Turf three times. He has won five races this year from seven starts, including prestigious victories in the Group 1 Grosser Preis von Berlin in Germany and a commanding 3½-length score in the Grade 1 Joe Hirsch Turf Classic at Aqueduct in September. Rebel's Romance's bid for a historic third Breeders' Cup Turf title is must-see TV.Fierceness (Classic)The beast from the East seeks Classic gloryFew horses arrive at the Breeders' Cup with as much talent, pedigree and unfinished business as Fierceness. The 4-year-old City of Light colt trained by Hall of Famer Todd Pletcher returns to Del Mar seeking redemption after finishing a gutsy second to Sierra Leone in last year's edition. Fierceness encompasses the complete package: pedigree, talent, tactical speed and big-race experience. However, he has also put in some disappointing performances in winnable situations. For that reason, he's a must-watch for me.Rhetorical (Mile)The Ultimate Underdog StoryRhetorical's trainer, Will Walden, has traveled a difficult road to reach racing's biggest stage. The son of WinStar Farm CEO Elliott Walden, Will struggled with severe drug and alcohol addiction for years before finding sobriety through the Stable Recovery program at Shepherds House in Kentucky. The program, created by Taylor Made Farm's Frank Taylor, helps recovering people with an addiction find employment and purpose within the thoroughbred industry.Rhetorical's racing history might be brief, but it's impressive. After an 8½-month layoff following his debut, the gelding returned in May 2025 with a runaway five-length allowance victory that opened eyes. He followed with increasingly impressive wins, culminating in the Coolmore Turf Mile at Keeneland in October, a Grade 1 race featuring seasoned European turf stars. In the Turf Mile, Rhetorical posted a shocking 9-1 upset, settling fourth early before unleashing a powerful late run under Irad Ortiz Jr. to defeat Program Trading and Brilliant Berti by ¾ length, posting a career-best 120 Equibase Speed Figure. Rhetorical may be a longshot against more experienced international turf milers, but that makes him intriguing. It would be a remarkable story and a fitting conclusion for all involved.\nNysos (Dirt Mile)Raw speed meets mile distanceThe 4-year-old Nyquist colt possesses speed figures that put him on another planet from most dirt horses, yet his tendency to miss training and races due to physical setbacks makes every start feel like a precious opportunity. When healthy and on the track, Nysos is simply devastating. His career record of five wins and one second from just six starts tells only part of the story; the manner of those victories captures attention. He opened his career with three consecutive wins by a combined 26¾ lengths, including a 7½-length romp in the 2024 Robert B. Lewis Stakes. If -- and it's admittedly a significant if -- Nysos makes it to post time for the Dirt Mile, he represents perhaps the most talented horse in the entire field.She Feels Pretty (Filly & Mare Turf)Turf Mare ExcellenceShe Feels Pretty burst onto the scene as a 2-year-old, winning the Grade 1 Natalma Stakes in just her second career start, a performance that gave trainer Cherie DeVaux her first Grade 1 triumph and punched the filly's ticket to the Breeders' Cup. Since then, She Feels Pretty has methodically built a record demanding respect: four Grade 1 victories and earnings exceeding $2 million across three racing seasons. There's really something exciting about seeing an American turf mare born and raised here compete against the top horses from Europe in a Breeders' Cup race. Can she outshine the European challengers and take home that prized victory? It's one of the most captivating storylines to watch on race day. She Feels Pretty enters the Breeders' Cup as the likely favorite among American-based runners.\n            ",

The cupboard, however, is far from bare in regards to White's play in the league, as he recorded five sacks a season ago.\nThe trading away of White continues the process of the Patriots forming their identity under Vrabel, who is overseeing the franchise's most successful season in some time. The Patriots lead the AFC East at 6-2 and are riding a five-game winning streak.\n            \n    ",

I love them. I think they know where I stand with them. I would die out there for them boys. I play as hard as I can to help us. Just do what I gotta do to help them. ... watching them would make me miss being out there. That's something that's hard.

    "body": "\n        Michael Jordan shared his insights on load management as the second installment of the \"Insights to Excellence\" series aired after the Bucks 121-111 win over the Knicks on Tuesday night. Unsurprisingly, Jordan isn't a fan of the increase in players taking games off to rest their bodies over the course of the 82-game season.\"It shouldn't be needed, first and foremost,\" Jordan said. \"You know, I never wanted to miss a game because it was an opportunity to prove -- it was something that I felt like, you know, the fans are there that watch me play. I want to impress that guy way up on top who probably worked his ass off to get a ticket or to get money to buy the ticket.\"\nOver his 15-year Hall of Fame career, Jordan rarely played in fewer than 70 games in a season. In fact, the three times it happened, one was due to a broken foot that limited him to 18 games his sophomore season, the second was when he came out of retirement midseason in 1995, and the third was in his first season after coming out of retirement the second time.\"You have a duty that if they're wanting to see you and as an entertainer, I want to show, right?\" Jordan said. \"So if the guys are coming to watch me play, I don't want to miss that opportunity. Physically, if I can't do it, then I can't do it. But physically, if I can do it and I just don't feel like doing it, that's a whole different lens.\"\n        \n            \n                Michael Jordan discusses last time shooting a ball, why he wishes he could still play in broadcast debut\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJordan then referenced his famed \"flu game\" during the 1997 NBA Finals. In Game 5 of that series against the Utah Jazz, Jordan fought off flu-like symptoms to lead the Chicago Bulls to a win and take a 3-2 lead in the series. Despite running a temperature of 103 degrees, Jordan dropped 38 points in the win.\n\"I could never leave my comrades if I could perform. Utah, great example. You know, everybody said it's a Game 5, which is very pivotal game,\" Jordan said. \"I was going to find a way to get out there, even if I was a decoy. Well, once I got out there, you never know how you're pushing yourself. You never know what happens, right? Next thing you know, the emotions, the situation, the need of the team, all those things catapulted me to, I'm gonna gut this thing out.\"Jordan is far from the only legend of his era to criticize load management, but trying to compare the two eras is like comparing apples and oranges. The game was far more physical in Jordan's era, but the game is much faster today, and more demanding even without the level of physicality that existed in the '80s and '90s.Load management is also often not a decision made by the players. \"It's usually not the player that is going to the training staff and saying, 'Hey, I don't have it tonight.' It's usually the other way around,\" Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry once said. \"There's a lot of science involved.\"\nBut something tells me that even if a team doctor told Jordan he should sit a game to rest his body, he'd probably say no. That's just the type of player he was.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 World Series is tied again and is now down to a best-of-three series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays.The Blue Jays got to Shohei Ohtani in Game 4 Tuesday and he was on the hook for four runs, including a two-run home run by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Shane Bieber, on the other hand, held the Dodgers hitters to just one run, a sacrifice fly off the bat of Kiké Hernández. The Game 4 win ties the series at 2 and guarantees at least one more game in Toronto on Halloween. The Dodgers took a wild Game 3 on a Freddie Freeman walk-off home run in the 18th inning Monday. Yoshinobu Yamamoto tossed a complete game in Los Angeles' Game 2 win, while the Blue Jays won Game 1 in an 11-4 blowout, including a grand slam by Addison Barger as part of a nine-run sixth inning.The Dodgers are back in the World Series for the second year in a row, looking to become the first back-to-back champion since the 1998-2000 Yankees. They completed their NLCS sweep of the Milwaukee Brewers last week and had a week off before World Series Game 1. They are the first reigning champion to return to the World Series since the 2009 Phillies. \nThe Blue Jays, meanwhile, took a tougher route through the ALCS but came out victorious in Game 7 against the Seattle Mariners. This marks their first World Series appearance since 1993.

    "body": "\n        The NCAA Division I Board voted Tuesday to delay the effective date of the legislative change that would permit college athletes to gamble on professional sports, pushing it back from Nov. 1 to Nov. 22. The move comes amid immense pushback from notable figures in college athletics, particularly SEC commissioner Greg Sankey, who voiced his concerns over the repealing of the NCAA's longstanding prohibition on sports betting.That the NCAA delayed the effective date to Nov. 22 in particular comes with important ramifications. That date is one day after the close of a membership rescission period in which Division I schools can vote to overturn proposed legislation. Division I rules state that schools may vote to rescind a proposal within 30 days if it is adopted by less than a 75% majority by the Division I cabinet.\nGiven the widespread opposition to the NCAA's new gambling legislation -- and that illegal gambling is in the headlines in the wake of the federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests -- there appears to be a legitimate chance that it is voted down during the rescission period.\n        \n            \n                Greg Sankey urges NCAA to nix rule change permitting sports betting: 'Major step in the wrong direction'\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSankey said in a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker that SEC presidents and chancellors have concerns with the legislation's impacts on competition, integrity and athlete well-being. Those feelings are also present in other leagues like the ACC, where Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi called the legislation \"absolutely one of the stupidest decisions I've ever seen.\"\nThe rule change does not alter the NCAA's stances on gambling in college athletics. Athletes will remain prohibited from betting on college games and sharing information with bettors. The legislation also includes plans to provide additional education and support to prevent problem gambling.\"On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association's commitment to maintaining strong national standards that keep collegiate participants separated from sports wagering activity at every level,\" Sankey said in his letter to the NCAA. \"If there are legal or practical concerns about the prior policy, those should be addressed through careful refinement -- not through wholesale removal of the guardrails that have long supported the integrity of games and the well-being of those who participate.\"Narduzzi pointed out recent issues in professional sports, including the NBA, which last week saw Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier arrested by the FBI as part of a federal investigation into illegal gambling.\n\"First of all, it's a habit,\" Narduzzi said. \"It's no different than smoking, drinking, doing drugs, it's a bad habit.

    "body": "\n        The NCAA could soon loosen its rules against sports betting, as it announced a pending legislative change that would allow college athletes to gamble on professional sports. That move, approved by the administrative committees across the NCAA's three divisions and now set to take effect on Nov. 22 (instead of Nov. 1), drew significant pushback from prominent figures in the college sports universe and remains subject to rescission. SEC commissioner Greg Sankey spoke up this week against the rule change.Sankey sent a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker on Oct. 25, obtained by ESPN, making it known that the SEC disagrees with the decision to allow athletes to bet on professional sports. He said in the letter that SEC presidents and chancellors came to the conclusion that \"this policy change represents a major step in the wrong direction.\" Importantly, the rule change does not alter the NCAA's stances on gambling on college athletics. Athletes will remain prohibited from betting on college games and sharing information with bettors.\"On behalf of our universities, I write to urge action by the NCAA Division I Board of Directors to rescind this change and reaffirm the Association's commitment to maintaining strong national standards that keep collegiate participants separated from sports wagering activity at every level,\" Sankey said in his letter to the NCAA. \"If there are legal or practical concerns about the prior policy, those should be addressed through careful refinement -- not through wholesale removal of the guardrails that have long supported the integrity of games and the well-being of those who participate.\"\n        \n            \n                College football early Week 10 betting guide: Notes for North Carolina at Syracuse and more\n                \n                    Bruce Marshall                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSankey argued that the rule change challenges the \"integrity of competition\" and that the SEC is concerned about its athletes' vulnerability. He called on the NCAA to restore its prior policy or modified rules prohibiting gambling at all levels. He raised concerns about the gambling industry's growing reach and influence and said the NCAA's removal of its barrier on professional sports betting \"sends the wrong signal.\"\nThe pushback on the NCAA's decision extends to other conferences, too. Pittsburgh football coach Pat Narduzzi this week called it \"absolutely one of the stupidest decisions I've ever seen.\" He pointed out recent issues in professional sports, including the NBA, which last week saw Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier arrested by the FBI as part of a federal investigation into illegal gambling.\"First of all, it's a habit,\" Narduzzi said. \"It's no different than smoking, drinking, doing drugs, it's a bad habit.

    "body": "\n        The New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks had already undergone fairly drastic changes when they reportedly attempted to negotiate a blockbuster trade this offseason. New York had fired coach Tom Thibodeau despite coming two wins short of the NBA Finals. Milwaukee agreed to pay the injured Damian Lillard more than $100 million to go away so they could sign Myles Turner in a desperate effort to remain competitive. Even after the fact, though, neither side could be described as fully settled.Giannis Antetokounmpo is two years away from free agency, which effectively means he is one year away from either extending his contract with the Bucks or getting traded to a team he prefers. According to ESPN's Shams Charania this offseason, that team would have been the Knicks. While Antetokounmpo stopped short of directly requesting a trade, he seems to have recognized the dire situation Lillard's torn Achilles and years of iffy management around the roster's fringes have left Milwaukee in. The Knicks, with a deep, win-now roster and an incredibly desirable market in New York City, were the team that appealed to him had he moved on.New York seemingly recognized that. They notably extended Mikal Bridges on July 31. Extensions of the sort Bridges signed carry a six-month trade restriction. His contract expires on Feb. 1, a mere four days before the Feb. 5 trade deadline. If the chance to land Antetokounmpo arose during the season, they wanted the flexibility to pounce. When they discussed a deal over the summer, though, they didn't get close.Now Antetokounmpo and the Bucks will host the Knicks for the first time since those offseason rumors. He'll get asked about them. Stars are always with these long-lasting rumblings. Think of LeBron James and Anthony Davis awkwardly navigating their desire to unite in Los Angeles with the teammates they actually had in 2019. The difference here, though, is that at least for the time being, all parties involved here are likely reasonably satisfied with how things have played out. A trade may come one day, but it doesn't feel quite necessary yet.\n        \n            \n                Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo jokes about building chemistry with Myles Turner: 'Six months ago, he hated me'\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Knicks wanted to improve in specific areas this offseason and, at least early on, have done so by and large. They've incredibly jumped from 28th to 1st in 3-point attempt rate. Their stale offense ranked 18th in the NBA in passes per game last season. This year, they've jumped from 281.2 to 309.3 passes per game, good for fifth in the league so far in this young season. That ball movement has been met with a similar verve and enthusiasm from the players themselves. Players are cutting and screening with a newfound intentionality. Everyone is touching the ball, and everyone is involved in the offense when they aren't. Heck, everyone is just involved, period. Gone are the days of Thibodeau's infamously short rotations. Mike Brown has used 12 players thus far, and 11 of them have played at least 28 minutes in three games. The democratization of the New York Knicks has, to this point, been a smashing success.\nThe Bucks have never been further from a democracy. It's a Giannisocracy in Milwaukee, and that has suited the Bucks just fine. His usage rate is up to 36.1%, the highest of his career, aside from his 2020 MVP season and the 2022-23 campaign, when he largely played without Khris Middleton. He's leading the NBA in rebounds, setting a new career-high in assists and averaging an absurd 36 points per game. The metrics suggest that this is the best he's ever played. He's blowing past career-best marks so far in virtually every all-in-one metric. The single-season PER record, for reference, is 32.85. Antetokounmpo is up to 42.82 thus far. At this rate, Antetokounmpo has a real chance at securing a third MVP trophy.The Bucks would be thrilled if he does. For all of the noise Antetokounmpo has made about winning another championship, the Bucks really don't have to get there this season. They just need to stall. If they can get to the summer without receiving a firm trade demand, they'll gain control of both a 2026 first-round pick (the worse of their own and New Orleans') and their own 2033 first-round pick from a trade perspective. Whenever Antetokounmpo gets close to leaving, Jon Horst pulls a rabbit out of his hat. Jrue Holiday. Lillard. Turner. If the Bucks can just survive until the summer, they can swing for another. If Antetokounmpo -- surrounded almost exclusively by shooters that amplify him as a ball-handler -- can win another MVP or come close, that seems like an attainable goal.We have a long way to go here. Until Giannis actually signs an extension, these rumors are going to persist. There's frankly plenty of time for any of the involved parties to develop some urgency. We're only three games into the season. It's too early to crown the Knicks Eastern Conference favorites, and if they don't reach the Finals, they're going to look into significant roster upgrades in the offseason. It's one thing to play the way Antetokounmpo has for three games. It's another to do so for 82. Can he handle this workload forever? Would he prefer to seek a true co-star in the short term to help him out? If the Bucks sense things going awry, is there a chance they'd act early in an attempt to retain more control over a possible trade than to allow Antetokounmpo to force his way somewhere specific, like New York, when he has the leverage to do so on an expiring contract?\nThese are all valid questions. The Antetokounmpo saga is going to take more twists and turns. But this isn't a repeat of James and Davis in 2019. Early in the season, the Knicks and Bucks are both reasonably happy with where they are. The Knicks have every reason to believe they can make the Finals without Antetokounmpo. The Bucks have every reason to believe they've been competitive enough to hold down the fort until they can bring in reinforcements next summer. A trade might make sense one day. It doesn't quite yet. Both sides are probably happy that they'll be able to see this season play out organically before making any decisions on a matter this seismic.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Internal Revenue Service issued a tax lien of more than $8 million dollars against Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier in November 2023, months after he allegedly pulled himself early from an NBA game as part of an illegal gambling scheme. Rozier, whom the FBI arrested last week amid the federal investigation into sports betting and illegal gambling, owed $8,218,211, according to county clerk records obtained by ESPN.There is no lien release on record, indicating that Rozier's debt either remains unpaid or is presently being processed. The IRS must file a lien release within 30 days of the debt payment.Broward County, Fla. records also show a construction lien filed against Rozier in August 2022. He paid $250,000 of the $271,000 lien by July 2023 after having work done on his property. That lien was issued months prior to Rozier's alleged involvement in the sports betting scheme, which occurred from December 2022 to March 2024 and involved seven NBA games.Rozier was arrested in connection with a sports betting ring that involves current and former NBA players trading inside, non-public information generally about injuries and illnesses. That information was allegedly distributed through a network of bettors who placed wagers worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n        \n            \n                NBA to assess gambling risks, review policies after arrests of Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRozier was specifically implicated for the March 23, 2023 game between the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans. The former Hornets guard allegedly pulled himself from the game as part of a preplanned move with the gambling ring. He played just 10 minutes before leaving the game with a foot injury. Sportsbooks received $200,000 in wagers on prop bets for Rozier's points, rebounds and assists. He was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\"The non-public information included when specific players would be sitting out future games, or when they would pull themselves out early for purported injuries or illnesses,\" U.S. attorney Joseph Nocella said. \"They relied on corrupt individuals, including [ex-NBA player Damon Jones] and Rozier. They also misused information through longstanding friendships they had with NBA players and coaches. And in at least one instance, they got their information by threatening a current player, [Jontay] Porter, because of his pre-existing gambling debts.\" The NBA placed Rozier on leave last week following his arrest. The league said it is in the process of reviewing the indictment and will cooperate with relevant authorities.\nRozier met with the FBI and NBA on multiple occasions in 2023 when the investigation began. He maintained his innocence throughout the probe, and the league conducted its own investigation in January 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Week 16 NFL schedule sees a number of teams playing their final home games of the regular season. Thus, there's nearly a full year's worth of home games to gather NFL betting trends from in order to help with Week 16 NFL picks. Two of those teams with their final home stands include the Ravens, who are -3 versus the Patriots, as well as the Cardinals who are +3 versus the Falcons. Both Baltimore and Arizona have a league-high of six ATS home losses this year, perhaps, making them ones to fade with Week 16 NFL predictions.There are more road favorites than home teams giving points, according to the Week 16 NFL odds. Amongst those home dogs are Giants (+3) versus the Vikings, the Panthers (+3) against the Bucs and the Titans (+3) against a Chiefs squad that lost Patrick Mahomes to a torn ACL and has been eliminated from playoff contention. All of the updated Week 16 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine's advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 16 NFL picks now.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 16 on a 52-37 run on top-rated picks dating back to 2024. Anybody following its NFL betting picks at sportsbooks and on betting sites could have seen strong returns.Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 16 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 16 NFL predictionsWe can tell you one of the model's strongest Week 16 NFL picks is that the Ravens (-3, 48) cover versus New England on Sunday night. Baltimore is coming off a dominant 24-0 win over Cincinnati, while the Patriots saw their 10-game win streak come to an end at the hands of Buffalo. The Pats have now dropped two of their last three versus the spread, as the team allowed season highs in points (35) and rushing yards (168) in the defeat to the Bills. Now, New England has to face the league's No. 3 rushing offense, led by Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson, and the quarterback has a stunning 16-0 regular season record in Week 15 or later. Baltimore is projected to rush for over 170 yards, which allows the Ravens to cover versus the spread 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Ravens using the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins right here:\nAnother one of its Week 16 NFL predictions: the Chiefs (-3, 37.5) cover versus the Titans in well over 50% of simulations in a Sunday kickoff at 1 p.m. ET. Patrick Mahomes' (torn ACL) injury shifted this line a full touchdown from Chiefs -10.5, but Kansas City still has a more complete team in just about all regards than Tennessee. While the Chiefs' No. 20 rushing offense isn't great, it's miles ahead of Tennessee's No. 30 ground attack. Then on defense, Kansas City boasts top 10 rankings in both points allowed and yards allowed, while the Titans rank in the bottom six in both categories. Tennessee is only 3-12 ATS over its last 15 home games and just allowed both its second-most total yards (430) and passing yards (292) of the year to San Fran on Sunday, so Gardner Minshew should be able to find success. The model also says the Under hits well over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here, and bet the Chiefs to cover at DraftKings:\nHow to make Week 16 NFL picksThe model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 16 NFL schedule and just revealed four A-rated picks with the spread and total, potentially giving you a huge payday.

    "body": "\n        Jake Paul isn't taking many shortcuts against Anthony Joshua. The two are set to throw down on Friday after Paul moved on from his original opponent, Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis, Paul vs. Joshua is a professional boxing match, unlike the exhibition fight that Paul was previously working towards. This means the result will impact their pro records. Paul (12-1, 6 KOs) and Joshua (28-4, 25 KOs) will wear the standard 10-ounce gloves used by heavyweights. Paul has competed in 10-ounce gloves for most of his career, excluding the unusual 14-ounce gloves used for his fight with \"Iron\" Mike Tyson. Against Davis, Paul was planning to wear 12-ounce gloves.  The fight will be contested at heavyweight, stripping Paul of his normal weight advantage against opponents. Paul normally competes at cruiserweight, 65 pounds higher than WBA champion Davis' usual weight class. Paul's only previous heavyweight fight was against Tyson, who was 30 years older than Paul. However, there is a stipulation that says Joshua cannot weigh more than 245 pounds for the bout.\n\n        \n            \n                Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua fight predictions, undercard, odds, start time for showdown in Miami\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"It's my job. We fight. We're licensed to kill. I'm sure many people don't understand it, but this is what my job is,\" Joshua said at the final press conference. \"When you're in that ring, it's a dangerous place to be and anything can happen. You hope your opponent leaves the ring safely, but if they don't, you still have to go to bed knowing that you just done your job. It wasn't personal.\"People don't like the fact that I'm fighting Jake. Whether that concerns me or not is another question. But if we look at the people that don't want me to be here, but they want me to put an end to Jake Paul's show, I understand it and that's why I have to carry boxing on my back with this fight.\"Perhaps the only stipulation benefiting Paul is the round totals. Joshua has exclusively competed in 12-round fights for the last decade, excluding a 10-round maximum for his short fight with Francis Ngannou. His fight with Paul is scheduled for eight three-minute rounds. With many believing Joshua will knock out Paul, this reduces the time Paul must theoretically survive.\nPaul is preparing for undoubtedly the biggest challenge of his career. The crossover star made a career by seeking opponents whose name value greatly outweighed their boxing experience, or who were significantly older or smaller than him. Though Joshua is 36 and likely beyond his prime, he should possess everything necessary to make short work of his opponent. Joshua is a two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist. Last year, he knocked out former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou in two rounds after Ngannou took Tyson Fury to a split decision.Paul vs. Joshua takes place on Saturday inside Miami's Kaseya Center.Who wins Anthony Joshua vs. Jake Paul on Dec. 19, and which massive longshot prop should you target for a huge payday? Visit SportsLine now to see Josh Nagel's best bets for the Friday, Dec. 19, heavyweight bout, all from the combat sports specialist who has covered the sport for more than 20 years, and find out.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Texas coach Steve Sarkisian turned the clock back Thursday by hiring Will Muschamp as the program's new defensive coordinator. As part of the move, the Longhorns parted ways with Pete Kwiatkowski, who was a finalist for the Broyles Award just one year earlier.Muschamp is widely regarded as one of the top defensive coordinators of the 21st century, including a run to the national championship game in 2009 under then-Texas coach Mack Brown. He later had uneven head coaching stints at Florida and South Carolina, though his defenses generally remained solid.Now, Muschamp is tasked with helping stabilize a Texas program that became the first preseason No. 1 team to fall out of the top 10 since 2012 USC. Fortifying the defense is part of that equation, but it is far from the only issue.Kwiatkowski's defenses were consistently strong over the past three seasons as Texas rose to national prominence. In fact, the Longhorns' defense has rated ahead of the offense in FEI in each of the past four years. During last season's run to the national semifinals, Texas ranked No. 3 nationally in FEI defense.\nCracks did form in 2025, particularly in the secondary. In a 29-21 loss to Florida, Texas allowed more than 450 yards of offense to a team that finished 4-8. The Longhorns were also overwhelmed through the air in the second half of a 35-10 loss to Georgia, surrendering four passing touchdowns to Gunner Stockton.Getting back in the game Muschamp's background working with defensive backs should help address those issues. He also brings significant SEC recruiting credentials that could elevate the talent level on that side of the ball.Still, it has been a long time since Muschamp has called a defense. During his time at Georgia from 2021-25, he was not a playcaller, even while serving as co-defensive coordinator alongside Glenn Schumann. His last stint calling plays came at South Carolina in 2020. His units were inconsistent down the stretch during that tenure ranging from as high as No. 19 to outside the top 40 in FEI.\nOver the past five years, Muschamp worked closely with Georgia coach Kirby Smart, one of the game's top defensive minds. Optimistically, that experience may have helped sharpen his approach, though he was not an on-field assistant for the past two seasons.What's the real problem?The more glaring reality, however, is this: Defense has not been Texas' primary problem.While the Longhorns ranked in the top 10 defensively in three of the past four seasons, Sarkisian's offense has not cracked the top 15 nationally. Its best FEI finish was No. 17 in 2022, Bijan Robinson's final season at Texas. In 2025, the Longhorns ranked 10th among 16 SEC teams in both scoring offense and total offense.\nIn all three losses, Texas' offense stalled. The Longhorns were scoreless through three quarters against Ohio State, had just seven late in the third quarter against Florida and managed only 10 in a loss to Georgia that cost them a College Football Playoff berth.After the season, Sarkisian fired first-year running backs coach Chad Scott, but the rest of the offensive staff remains intact. Sarkisian will also continue calling plays, despite mounting calls for him to hire a true offensive coordinator. Yet throughout his tenure, Texas' offense has not faced the same level of scrutiny as its defense.Of the five offensive assistants Sarkisian hired in 2021, three remain. Running backs coach Stan Drayton, a holdover from the previous staff, left to become head coach at Temple. Wide receivers coach Andre Coleman, another holdover, is the only offensive assistant who has been fired. During the Sarkisian era, nine of Texas' 11 All-Americans have come on defense or special teams.\nTexas attempted a similar nostalgia play last season by bringing back legendary secondary coach Duane Akina as defensive passing game coordinator. Akina, ironically, coached defensive backs at Texas when Muschamp was defensive coordinator. The move backfired, as the Longhorns finished last in SEC play in passing defense.Maybe this time will be different. Muschamp is 15 years younger than Akina and still firmly in his coaching prime. But no defensive overhaul will elevate Texas to national-title caliber unless the offense is held to the same standard.\n            ",

Adaway's attorney, B. Keith Jackson, said to The Washington Post that the Gamecocks running back filed a complaint on Dec. 12 accusing the trooper of assault. The Brazos County (Texas) District Attorney is considering whether to move forward with charges.Adaway's attempts to learn the trooper's name have come up short. Neither Texas A&M Police nor the Texas Department of Public Safety declined to provide identification, even after Adaway called campus police to report an assault. Adaway said he wants to know the trooper's name and to receive an apology.In the month since the game, Adaway said he has lost sleep over the incident and has seen a University of South Carolina sports psychiatrist because of the emotional distress.\"You see this sort of thing on TV -- different scenarios of police bullying people here and there -- but you never feel it and understand it until you're actually in the situation,\" Adaway said to the Washington Post.The incident occurred in the final minute of the second quarter after Harbor scored an 80-yard touchdown. Harbor ran through the end zone and partway up a tunnel while holding the back of his right leg in apparent discomfort. Multiple teammates, including Adaway, followed him into the tunnel and walked with him back toward the field. As they exited from the tunnel, the trooper walked the opposite direction, bumped into them and turned around to point at and say something to them.\nReactions to the incident poured in throughout the sports world. LeBron James was among the numerous prominent figures to comment on the situation.The Texas DPS relieved the officer of his game-day duties and sent him home after the incident.\"The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) is aware of the incident that occurred today during the Texas A&M football game,\" the DPS said in a statement. \"The DPS Trooper involved was sent home from the game. Our Office of Inspector General (OIG) is also aware of the incident and will be further looking into the matter. No additional information will be released at this time.\"\nThe touchdown that preceded the incident gave South Carolina a stunning 27-3 lead over Texas A&M. The Gamecocks eventually extended their advantage to 30-3 before the Aggies rallied back for the largest comeback in program history, erasing a 27-point deficit for a 31-30 victory to remain undefeated at the time.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        It was a disappointing day in Riyad for Christian Pulisic and AC Milan as the Rossoneri lost 2-0 in the Supercoppa Italiana semifinal against Napoli and miss their first chance to win a major trophy this season. The team coached by Antonio Conte, on the other hand, will meet the winner of Bologna vs. Inter, which will take place on Friday at 2 p.m. ET. On Monday, the final will be played at 2 p.m. ET at the King Saud University Stadium. Thursday's match did not go as planned for Massimiliano Allegri's side, who conceded twice to David Neres and Rasmus Højlund due to defensive errors by the Rossoneri. The game also exposed flaws within the team that had not been evident earlier this season. After losing to Lazio in the round of 16 of the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa defeat, Pulisic's only chance to win a trophy with AC Milan this season is now on the Serie A title, as the Italian giants are not part of any European tournament due to the disappointing 2024-25 season. \nAllegri decided to bench some of the biggest stars of the team in the semifinal, including former Real Madrid captain Luka Modric, who only entered the pitch in the final minutes, showing that this team needs a player of his talent in the midfield. AC Milan this season have demonstrated to be consistent, but this defeat against Napoli is only the third one of the season, after the Serie A opening game against Cremonese on Aug. 23 and the Coppa loss to Lazio on Dec 4. AC Milan should now focus on the league with some more days of rest compared to the competitors, such as Napoli and Inter, as they will now meet Hellas Verona on Dec. 28 before meeting Cagliari, Genoa and Fiorentina, teams that are all competing to avoid relegation. This is going to be a crucial stint for both Pulisic and the Italian giants as the upcoming schedule can give them a boost to their title hopes. The American international, who already scored nine goals and provided two assists in the 14 games he played so far in all competitions during the 2025-26 season, is still hoping to win a major trophy this season ahead of the 2026 World Cup, where he will lead the USMNT at home.\nWinning the Serie A title would be an incredible achievement, and the Rossoneri have a genuine chance to make it happen given Massimiliano Allegri's experience and the quality of the squad at his disposal. However, the semifinal loss to Napoli showed that, despite their injuries, Conte's side must still be considered the team to beat as reigning champs.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\nAll four members of the NFC North have finished atop the division over the last seven years, with the Green Bay Packers capturing the crown three times and the Detroit Lions accomplishing the feat each of the last two campaigns. With three weeks remaining in the 2025 NFL season, only the Minnesota Vikings have been knocked out of contention for the title.The Chicago Bears currently occupy first place in the NFC North with a 10-4 record, which marks the first time the team has reached double-digit wins -- and second in 13 seasons -- since going 12-4 and winning the division in 2018. Green Bay is right on their heels at 9-4-1, setting up an epic showdown at Soldier Field in Chicago on Saturday night.The long-time rivals met at Lambeau Field just two weeks ago and the Packers came away with a 28-21 triumph, ending the Bears' five-game winning streak. Jordan Love threw three touchdown passes -- two to Christian Watson -- and Josh Jacobs rushed for 86 yards and a TD with 3:32 remaining in the fourth quarter that snapped a 21-21 tie.Green Bay will be without Micah Parsons, who is tied for third in the NFL with 12.5 sacks, after he suffered a season-ending torn ACL in last week's 34-26 road loss to the Denver Broncos. In addition, Watson (chest/shoulder) and Jacobs (knee/ankle) are listed as questionable, while Chicago wideout Rome Odunze (foot) will miss his third straight game and running back D'Andre Swift (groin) is questionable.\nSwift had one of his best games of the season in Chicago's 31-3 rout of the Cleveland Browns last Sunday as he ran for a pair of touchdowns and finished two yards shy of his fourth 100-yard rushing performance of 2025. His absence would be damaging for a Bears ground attack that is second in the NFL with an average of 151.9 yards per contest.Chicago also is fifth in the league in total offense (369.1 yards), and on the other side of the ball, it can cause major problems for Love and the Packers' offense as it leads all teams in turnover differential (plus-20) and interceptions (21). Love went four straight games without an interception before being picked off by C.J. Gardner-Johnson in his first meeting with the Bears this year.While things currently look somewhat bleak for a playoff berth for the Lions, let alone their third consecutive NFC North title, they can't be counted out just yet. It's difficult to do so to a team that is first in the NFL in scoring (30.6 points), third in passing (248.8 yards) and fourth in total offense (379.9).Jared Goff ranks second in touchdown passes (29) and third in passing yards (3,672), Amon-Ra St. Brown is second in TD receptions (12) and Jahmyr Gibbs is tied for second with 13 rushing scores. Yes, Detroit has been wildly inconsistent since posting a four-game winning streak early in the season, alternating losses and victories over its last nine contests, but with such a high-powered offense, it certainly is capable of running the table to end the regular season.Practially, the Lions should have their sights set on overtaking the Packers for the third wild card spot in the NFC. A win by Chicago on Saturday and a victory by Detroit against Pittsburgh the following day would leave the Lions just a half-game behind Green Bay with two remaining.\nDetroit plays its final two games on the road against the Vikings and Bears, who visit the San Francisco 49ers after their meeting with the Packers. Green Bay hosts the Baltimore Ravens in Week 17 before closing out the regular season at Minnesota.The Bears and Packers both have a chance to clinch a postseason berth this week. Whichever team wins their matchup will punch its ticket if the Lions lose or tie their meeting with the Steelers on Sunday. Should the Chicago-Green Bay game end in a deadlock, a loss by Detroit would send both clubs to the playoffs.Even though the Bears own a slight lead in the NFC North, SportsLine's Inside the Lines team and its projection model currently give the Packers the best chance to win the division. But the ITL team's model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, believes the window will close substantially for Green Bay with a loss on Saturday.The same can be said for Chicago with a Week 16 defeat and, according to the model, Detroit's already extremely thin chances for the crown would completely disappear with a setback against Pittsburgh. A victory would slightly improve its outlook for the division title but considerably increase its prospects for a playoff spot.CHANCES OF MAKING PLAYOFFSTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCEChicago Bears80.8%94.4%69.6%24.8%Green Bay Packers89.7%99.0%80.0%19.0%Detroit Lions33.9%43.9%14.7%29.2%CHANCES OF WINNING NFC NORTHTEAMCURRENTWITH WEEK 16 WINWITH WEEK 16 LOSSDIFFERENCEChicago Bears45.2%78.1%16.3%61.8%Green Bay Packers48.8%80.6%12.8%67.8%Detroit Lions6.0%8.9%0.0%8.9%The storied all-time series between Green Bay and Chicago is relatively close, with the Packers owning a 108-95-6 advantage in the regular season. The Bears have struggled mightily of late, however, winning only four of their last 30 meetings. Chicago hasn't posted consecutive victories against Green Bay since sweeping the two-game season series in 2007.Caleb Williams and company obviously can't do that with a win in Week 16, but the Bears can move closer to - and even secure, with help -- their first postseason berth in five years. However, Green Bay is a 1.5-point favorite against Chicago in the latest NFL odds at DraftKings, and the model is predicting a 26-23 triumph by the Packers.The Lions are seven-point favorites at DraftKings in their matchup against the Steelers, with the ITL team's model calling for a 30-22 win by Detroit.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Any way you slice it, this is looking to be a down season for ACC women's basketball. At the start of the season, five ACC teams were ranked in the AP Top 25, with Duke and NC State leading the way at No. 7 and No. 9, respectively. Seven weeks later, both Duke and N.C. State have fallen completely out of the Top 25 and only three ACC teams remain: Louisville at No. 16, North Carolina at No. 18 and Notre Dame at No. 19.Yes, that would be the Louisville Cardinals sitting at the top of the ACC almost two months into the season.It's not exactly a surprise that Louisville is in the mix -- as head coach Jeff Walz is quick to remind everyone, Louisville was first in the ACC from 2017-2021 and from 2017-2023, the Cardinals made five straight Elite Eights and two Final Fours. But the last two seasons have been comparatively down years -- the Cardinals finished fifth in the ACC in 2024 and fourth in 2025, and had two consecutive first-weekend losses in the NCAA tournament. Perhaps that explains why they were ranked fourth in the ACC preseason poll.Louisville is 10-3 on the season, but all three of their losses came against quality opponents – No. 1 UConn on opening day, No. 20 Kentucky in an in-state rivalry game and No. 3 South Carolina. The Cardinals turned a lot of heads when they pushed the Gamecocks to the brink before falling 79-77. \nThen on Sunday night in Chapel Hill, Louisville got its first ranked win of the season, taking down then-No. 11 North Carolina in overtime, 76-66. This Saturday, Louisville will get a chance to get another top 25 win when it faces No. 17 Tennessee at the Women's Champions Classic at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.Heading into the nonstop conference play of January and February, it's worth considering not just that Louisville might be one of the best teams in the underperforming ACC, but that they might be one of the top 10 teams in the country before all is said and done and a real threat to make it to the ninth Elite Eight of the Walz era.Here are a few reasons why Louisville is the early-season ACC frontrunner:Six of last year's elite freshmen class returnedRoster turnover is a way of life in college sports these days, and Louisville is not immune -- in fact, the Cardinals faced one of their starters from last season, Nyla Harris, in Chapel Hill on Sunday. But Louisville actually has a lot of roster consistency from last year, with seven returnees. This means that the Cardinals have players who know Walz's system, know the conference and, perhaps most importantly, know each other on and off the court. And these are high-pedigree players.\nIn 2024, the Cardinals had the sixth-best recruiting class in the nation, per ESPN. Of those seven standout freshmen, six returned to Louisville this season, including Tajianna Roberts, who led the team in minutes as a freshman and came into this season on the Naismith Trophy Women's Player of the Year Watch List, the Ann Meyers Drysdale Award Watch List and as a Preseason All-ACC selection. She's leading the team with 13 points per game right now, and after a slow start to the season in the UConn game, she has shown up when it matters the most, scoring 22 points against Kentucky, 20 against South Carolina and notching 11 points, four assists and four steals against North Carolina.\nAnother notable player from that elite recruiting class is Imari Berry. Even though Berry is still coming off of the bench like she did last season, she's averaging 9.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.4 steals in 21.2 minutes per game, all massive increases from last season. She hit several key shots down the stretch against the Tar Heels, and while Walz is still trying to get her to eliminate in-game mistakes, he's bullish on her potential.\"She's a kid that if she can figure it out, that she can be one of the best players in this league and one of the best players in college basketball, because she can do things that others can't, athletically, and she's so smooth,\" Walz said.\nElif Istanbulluoglu took a major leapThis is Turkish junior Elif Istanbulluoglu's third year at Louisville, and it is already far and away her most productive season. Last season, she came off the bench and only averaged three points and two rebounds in 13 minutes per game. This year, she is a starter averaging 8.8 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. In the win against North Carolina, the 6-foot-3 forward had a career-high 16 points. \"I thought Elif played extremely well. She made a couple big time shots. She's been getting in the gym, working on her 3, and it's starting to show and that allows us to spread the floor more,\" Walz said.\nThis summer, Walz was the assistant coach for the Turkish national team, and so got to spend more time with Istanbulluoglu and see her development up close.\nWalz told reporters that last season, he joked with Istanbulluoglu that her middle name was \"but,\" because she would always come up with excuses not to put in extra work. But this year, she told him she wasn't going to say \"but\" anymore. Things seemed to click for her this summer with the national team, when she would see the pros on her team go to the gym before practice, put up extra shots after practice and painstakingly take care of their bodies.\"She has dedicated herself to that, and it's what's changed it all,\" Walz said. \"She realizes she has seen success now because she's putting the time in, and that, to me, is what it's all about.\"\nTransfer Laura Ziegler is making a big impactLaura Ziegler was one of the most noteworthy transfers into the ACC this season, and she's living up to the hype -- and then some -- early on. The senior from Denmark spent the first three years of her collegiate career at Saint Joseph's, where she averaged 17.5 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists last season and was a Becky Hammon Mid-Major Player of the Year finalist.While her stats aren't as eye-popping this season, in part because her minutes are down due to the lopsided nature of many of Louisville's wins and in part because she's surrounded by more talent on the Cardinals than she was with the Hawks, she is still making a massive impact with 11.6 points, 7.4 rebounds and 2.6 assists. Last week she was named the ACC Co-Player of the Week.\nAgainst North Carolina, she was a key force in getting Louisville early control of the game, scoring 13 of her season-high 17 points in the first quarter. Though her offensive production slowed down after that, Walz was incredibly pleased with how she played the entire game. He pointed out that she's a veteran player who is able to positively influence the game even when she isn't scoring -- and since the team is still so young, her experience is invaluable.\"What I appreciate about Laura is she didn't force any shots. She played 42 minutes for us, had two assists, zero turnovers and played a great basketball game,\" he said. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn't want to speculate about his future with the Milwaukee Bucks. On Thursday, the two-time MVP addressed rumors that he and his agent were contemplating whether Milwaukee was still the right fit for him.Antetokounmpo claimed he was unaware of a report earlier this month about conversations between his agent, Alex Saratsis, and the Bucks about whether his NBA future was best served by remaining in Milwaukee or heading elsewhere. The Bucks' star player said that his priority was getting healthy and that his agent is free to have his own conversations without Antetokounmpo's involvement.\"I didn't hear about the report,\" Antetokounmpo told reporters. \"Again, if my agent is talking to the  Bucks about it, he is his own person. He can have any conversation he  wants about it. At the end of the day, I don't work for my agent; my  agent works for me. And there's going to be conversations that are going  to be made between him and the Bucks, and him and his other players,  and him and other teams and other GMs, executives around the league.  It's something that you can't control. \"But, at the end of the day, I  personally have not had the conversation with the Bucks. I'm still  locked in, locked in on my teammates. Most importantly, locked in on me  getting back healthy.\"\nAntetokounmpo has been sidelined since straining his calf against the Detroit Pistons on Dec 3. The Bucks initially believed he'd be out for two to four weeks, but Antetokounmpo says his four to six weeks is a more realistic timetable. Antetokounmpo, 31, believes he may have returned too early from a left adductor strain last month, leading to the calf injury four games later.\"Maybe it was  a mistake of me coming back a little bit earlier, because  once I come  back, now you're overcompensating,\" Antetokounmpo said.  \"The only way  you can pop your soleus is by overcompensating and then  having an  extreme amount of load or playing a lot of games in a short  period of time.\"In August, ESPN reported trade talks between the Bucks and the New York Knicks regarding Antetokounmpo. Nothing materialized as he recommitted himself to the Bucks, but talks of an eventual trade have only grown since.\n\"This  is the most I've ever been talked about in my career,\"  Antetokounmpo  said. \"I'm in my house with my kids and all that, and I'm  opening the TV, and it's like, 'Oh, Giannis is going to the Memphis  Grizzlies,' or  'Giannis is going to the Detroit Pistons.' Which, hey  man, I'm not going  to lie, I'm the hottest chick in the game right now.  No, I'm joking.\" The Bucks have struggled to recreate the magic that led them to become 2021 NBA champions. The Bucks carry an 11-16 record heading into Thursday's game against the Toronto Raptors, including a 2-8 stretch without Antetokounmpo on the court. Antetokounmpo insists that he won't use his status on the team as leverage or a threat to demand results from his team.\"I'm never going to have a meeting with my teammates and sit  everybody down and talk about like, 'Hey guys, hey, if we don't win I'm  going to get out of here,'\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Like, come on. We're  grown ... That's not going to happen. They're grown, too. I think  they understand the deal. You've just got to give urgency to the team.  Like, 'Guys, this is like serious. Who are we trying to be? We've got to  turn this around. We have time to turn this around.' And you've got to  have a little bit more urgency.\n\"I think I've had the conversation  with the coach about it. I think I've had the conversation with  individual players about it. I've been approached by teammates and asked  about the rumors because it also might affect their own life and their  own career. I'm straight with them, whatever that answer might be.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of two College Football Playoff first-round rematches takes place Saturday when No. 6 Ole Miss hosts No. 11 Tulane. The teams met in September, when Ole Miss rolled to a 45-10 win on its way to an 11-1 regular-season record. That game helped cement Trinidad Chambliss as the Rebels' quarterback of the future. Starting in place of an injured Austin Simmons, Chambliss threw for 307 yards and two touchdowns while adding 112 yards on the ground. Much has changed since that Sept. 20 meeting in Oxford. Lane Kiffin, who led Ole Miss that day, has since departed for LSU. Pete Golding, the defensive coordinator at the time, is now the Rebels' head coach. And Jon Sumrall, who was on the opposite sideline, is juggling two full-time jobs after accepting the Florida position. There's a lot in motion, and that doesn't even account for the magnitude of the moment. A home playoff game at Ole Miss has a strong case as the most significant sporting event in Mississippi state history. The small town of Oxford will be packed with fans for an unprecedented December playoff game inside Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. \n Ole Miss vs. Tulane: Need to know How different does Ole Miss look? In the aftermath of Kiffin's messy departure, it's the biggest question heading into this game. Kiffin, long regarded as one of the sport's top offensive minds, is gone, and it's fair to wonder how that affects the Rebels' offense even with coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. staying on for the playoff run. In his first game as head coach, does Golding take a more conservative approach than Kiffin? Does Ole Miss lean more heavily on the run and embrace a defense-wins-championships mindset? This will be our first real look at what Golding's version of Ole Miss looks like, and it will be fascinating to see how closely he sticks to what worked under Kiffin. Where does Tulane find an edge? Almost nothing went right for the Green Wave in the first meeting. While Kiffin's departure creates opportunity, Tulane is dealing with its own challenges. Sumrall and offensive coordinator Will Hall are both pulling double duty as Sumrall prepares to leave for Florida and Hall gets ready to take over as head coach. Tulane used two quarterbacks in the first matchup, Jake Retzlaff and Brendan Sullivan, and neither found success. The pair combined for just 104 passing yards on 29 attempts. Since then, Retzlaff has settled in and helped Tulane close the season on a five-game winning streak. Even if Ole Miss is less explosive offensively, Tulane will still need to keep pace, and that will require an efficient night from Retzlaff. Running back Jamauri McClure, who had only three carries in the first meeting, enters hot after rushing 22 times for 121 yards and a touchdown in the American Championship Game win over North Texas. The best running back who doesn't get the requisite hype: Kewan Lacy was not a Heisman Trophy finalist like Notre Dame's Jeremiyah Love. He didn't make first-team All-America at CBS Sports, the Associated Press or Sporting News. But it's long past time more people know about Ole Miss' star running back. Lacy finished with the nation's second-most rushing touchdowns at 20 and totaled 1,279 rushing yards. In his last two games alone, against Florida and Mississippi State, he rushed for 367 yards and four touchdowns while serving as the engine of the Rebels' offense. Trinidad Chambliss understandably draws most of the attention, but Lacy presents another major challenge Tulane must solve Saturday. \n Where to watch Ole Miss vs. Tulane live Date: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 3:30 p.m. ET Location: Vaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi TV: TNT | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Ole Miss vs. Tulane prediction, picks \nTulane is better than the 35-point whupping it received back in September. And with all the change and drama Ole Miss has experienced in the last month, it is easy to see how this result will be closer. But even with all that said, I don't see how Tulane pulls off the upset in Oxford. The team is fired up to play for new head coach Pete Golding. Ole Miss fans have been waiting for a moment like this their whole lives and the Rebels are simply too talented for Tulane to keep up. Take the Rebels.

    "body": "\n        No. 7 Texas A&M hosts No. 10 Miami in a pivotal first-round matchup of the College Football Playoff at Kyle Field. The Aggies are fresh off a historic season, an 11-1 campaign, the most wins for the program since 2012. However, Texas A&M struggled in its final game, a loss against rival Texas. Miami started the 2025 season on fire, but had to recover after losing games to Louisville and SMU by a combined nine points midseason. The losses cost them a shot at playing for the ACC title, but blazing through the month of November was enough to deliver them their first College Football Playoff appearance as the final team in. Texas A&M and Miami have played five teams, including a recent home-and-home series in 2022-23. The Hurricanes won 48-33 in their most recent matchup, the second game for Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson. However, the matchup will look much different with Mike Elko now leading Texas A&M.   Miami vs. Texas A&M: Need to know  War in the trenches: Miami and Texas A&M come into the matchup boasting some of the top trench play of any teams in the playoff. Hurricanes offensive lineman Francis Mauigoa leads a unit that allowed only 11 total sacks this year. The Aggies were close behind at 12, both ranking top 11 nationally. But, Texas A&M also leads the nation with 41 sacks behind All-American defensive end Cashius Howell, and Miami had 34. The chess match between the lines will be the matchup of the weekend. Star receivers: Texas A&M invested heavily into its wide receiver corps and the unit has carried the program to new heights. Transfers KC Concepcion and Mario Craver each posted at least 50 catches for 800 yards, and others like Ashton Bethel-Roman and tight end Nate Boerkircher have each come up big in major moments. Few teams are built to win outside in, but the Aggies have that kind of ability. \nAll eyes on Bain: If the Heisman was given in September, Miami defensive end Rueben Bain Jr. might have walked away with it. The defensive end was unbelievable, wreaking havoc and making disruptive plays during a 5-0 start. However, both his production and grading have fallen off precipitously. Bain posted 1.5 sacks in the season finale against Pittsburgh; could he wake up in the season's most important moments?   Where to watch Miami vs. Texas A&M live  Date: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 12 p.m. ET  Location: Kyle Field -- College Station, Texas  TV: ABC | Live stream: Fubo (Start watching, save $20!)  Miami vs. Texas A&M prediction, picks  \nThe matchup between Texas A&M and Miami is a true heavyweight battle. Both teams have the upside to win the national championship if things break right, and the first round will be an important stress test. Miami quarterback Carson Beck has the experience edge, but Texas A&M's offense has an explosive component that will prove to be the difference in College Station. Pick: Texas A&M -3.5\n\n

    "body": "\n        The sixth edition of the World Baseball Classic will be played in March 2026, three years after a thrilling 2023 finale between USA and Japan. That, of course, ended when Shohei Ohtani struck out then-Angels teammate Mike Trout. It was the most captivating moment of the baseball season, MLB postseason included. Hopefully we're in for more of the same next spring. The WBC expanded to 20 teams last time and the top four finishers in the four 2023 pools received an automatic berth into the 2026 WBC. Those 16 teams are Australia, Canada, Cuba, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Great Britain, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Korea, United States, and Venezuela. Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Colombia, and Nicaragua earned the final four berths in qualifying tournaments during spring training 2025. The pools for the 2026 WBC were finalized in April, with the U.S. in the same bracket as Mexico, Italy, Great Britain, and Brazil. The tournament opens with Pool C (Tokyo) on March 5. Pool A (Puerto Rico), Pool B (Houston), and Pool D (Miami) begin play the next day. The Championship Game is scheduled for Tuesday, March 17, at loanDepot Park in Miami, the same venue that hosted the 2023 WBC Championship Game. Long-time big leaguer and current MLB Network analyst Mark DeRosa will return as Team USA's manager.\"Getting the chance to share the clubhouse and dugout with USA's  greatest staff and players was one of the highlights of my life,\" DeRosa said in April. \"I'm extremely grateful and fired up to get another opportunity  to put USA across my chest come March.\" \nJapan went 7-0 and outscored their opponents 56-18 in their seven games en route to their third WBC title in 2023 (they also won in 2006 and 2009). The Dominican Republic won the 2013 WBC and USA won the 2017 tournament. Here now are the players who have already committed to suiting up for USA  in the 2026 WBC. The roster is subject to change right up until it is  announced officially.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Aaron Judge, Yankees Judge, the reigning two-time American League MVP, was announced as USA's captain and the first player to commit to the club back in April. It will be his first time playing in the WBC. \"I wanted to be there (in 2023). I was looking forward to this opportunity  again,\" the Yankees slugger said, noting he skipped the 2023 WBC because he had just been named New York's captain and wanted to focus on that. This past season, Judge slugged 53 home runs and led baseball in batting average (.331), on-base percentage (.457), slugging percentage (.688), and WAR (9.7). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SP Paul Skenes, Pirates USA will have the reigning AL MVP in the lineup and the reigning National League Cy Young atop the rotation. Skenes, who pitched for Air Force before transferring to LSU, committed to USA in May. \"If I ever get the chance to do this, I'm never saying no,\" he said. With all due respect to Jake Peavy and Roger Clemens, who was nearing the end of his career in 2006, Skenes very well might be the best pitcher to ever suit up for USA in the WBC. He had a 1.97 ERA with 216 strikeouts in 187 ⅔ innings this season, and joined Doc Gooden as the only pitchers in history to win Rookie of the Year one year and Cy Young the next. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     SS Bobby Witt Jr., Royals Bobby Baseball is returning to the WBC. Witt committed to USA in June and figures to their starting shortstop this time around. He was on the 2023 roster and was used primarily as a pinch-runner, going 1 for 2 with a double in his five appearances. \"It's a blast. These are the things you dream  of,\" Witt said about the 2023 WBC. Back then, he was heading into his sophomore season. This time around, Witt is a fully formed superstar. He authored a .295/.351/.501 slash line with 23 homers, 38 steals, and a league-leading 47 doubles in 2025. Witt finished fourth in the AL MVP voting and won his second straight Gold Glove. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     C Cal Raleigh, Mariners USA will have a 60-homer man behind the plate next spring. Raleigh set a new single-season home run record for a catcher and a switch-hitter in 2025, and was the runner-up to Judge for AL MVP. It will be his first WBC experience. \"I'm  just very honored that they would pick me and I'm  really looking forward to hopefully creating a memory and winning gold,\" Raleigh said in July. He led MLB in homers (60) and RBI (125) this past season while slashing .247/.359/.589 and playing excellent defense at the game's most demanding position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Pete Crow-Armstrong, Cubs Fresh off a 30-30 season, Crow-Armstrong and his Gold Glove defense will roam center field for USA in the WBC. His commitment to the event was confirmed in November. \"I love playing for my country more than anything,\" Crow-Armstrong said. PCA was a 6.0 WAR player in 2025 thanks to top of the line defense as well as his 31 homers and 35 steals. He joined Sammy Sosa as the only players in Cubs' history to go 30-30 and finished ninth in the NL MVP voting. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     OF Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks USA's outfield will feature three All-Stars and three top-9 finishers in the MVP voting. Carroll will join Crow-Armstrong and Judge on the roster, he announced in November. \"It was not a hard decision. I couldn't be more excited. It's going to be awesome,\" Carroll said. He led the league in triples for the third year in a row in 2025, and hit .259/.343/.541 with 31 home runs and 32 steals. It was Carroll's first 30-30 season. He was an All-Star for the second time and he finished sixth in the NL MVP voting, his second time finishing that high (fifth in 2023). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     RP Garrett Whitlock, Red Sox One of the game's top right-handed relievers will be in USA's bullpen. Whitlock announced his commitment to USA on social media in November. It will be his first time playing in the tournament. After battling injuries and bouncing between the rotation and bullpen from 2022-24, Whitlock became a full-time reliever in 2025 and threw 72 innings with a 2.25 ERA and 91 strikeouts. He frequently worked multiple innings, which will come in handy in the early rounds of the WBC, when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Matthew Boyd, CubsAfter battling injury and inconsistency for the first decade of his MLB career, Boyd busted out with his first All-Star berth in 2025 at age 34. He announced Wednesday on Foul Territory that he'll be on Team USA for the WBC in 2026. Boyd returned from Tommy John surgery in 2024 with the Guardians and pitched to a 2.72 ERA in eight starts. It was good enough to earn a two-year, $29 million deal with an option for 2027 from the Cubs. In 2025, he went 14-8 with a 3.21 ERA and 154 strikeouts in 179 ⅔ innings. Upon his announcement, Boyd became the first left-handed pitcher on Team USA for this cycle and it seems pretty likely he'll be in the rotation for the event.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    OF/DH Kyle Schwarber, free agentSchwarber, one of the game's most productive hitters, hasn't yet chosen which team he'll suit up for during the coming regular season. He has, however, declared that he'll play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic. Schwarber has averaged a 135 OPS+ with 47 home runs per season over the last three years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    C Will Smith, DodgersSmith, fresh off winning a second World Series title in a row, will be in the squat for Team USA as he pursues an international championship to add to his collection. Smith has developed into one of the best backstops in baseball and over the past three seasons has amassed a 125 OPS+ and 12 Wins Above Replacement.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    INF Gunnar Henderson, OriolesHenderson will be making his first WBC appearance after blossoming into a star with the Orioles in recent years. Over the course of his first four seasons in the majors, he's compiled a 134 OPS+ and more than 21 Wins Above Replacement. His experience at shortstop and third base could come in handy, depending on the rest of the roster.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2B Brice Turang, BrewersTurang is fresh off a breakout season with the Brewers that saw him post new career highs in home runs (18) and WAR (5.6). He's a high-quality defender capable of stealing a base as well, giving him a broad base of skills. Turang will be a weapon for USA regardless of whether he starts at second base, or comes off the bench to pinch-hit/pinch-run.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RP Garrett Cleavinger, RaysOne of the game's more underrated relievers, Cleavinger figures to be DeRosa's go-to lefty in the WBC. He threw 61 ⅓ innings with a 2.35 ERA in 2025, and struck out 33.7% of the batters he faced. That was a top-15 mark among relievers, and fourth highest among lefties. Cleavinger held same-side hitters to a .187 batting average and .274 on-base percentage this past season, his sixth in the majors and fourth with Tampa.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RP Griffin Jax, RaysJax, one of the most sought after relievers at the 2025 trade deadline, will be part of USA's bullpen in the WBC. The former Twin/current Ray had an unsightly 4.23 ERA this past season, though his underlying numbers are off the charts good. Jax's 35.0% strikeout rate and 18.1% swinging strike rate are among the very best in baseball thanks to a monster sweeper and upper-90s fastball. Few pitchers are as good at missing bats as Jax. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Nolan McLean, MetsUSA's rotation will include a leading candidate for 2026 NL Rookie of the Year. McLean made his MLB debut with the Mets this past August and dazzled down the stretch, pitching to a 2.06 ERA with 57 strikeouts in 48 innings. His deep six-pitch arsenal, which includes a mid-90s sinker and big-breaking sweeper, gives McLean the second-best pure stuff on USA's staff behind Skenes.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Clay Holmes, MetsHolmes, McLean's rotation mate in Queens, will also be on USA's roster. He made the transition from reliever to starter in 2025 and things went well: 3.53 ERA in 165 ⅔ innings. Given his experience as a reliever and ability to pitch multiple innings as a starter, Holmes would make for an interesting multi-inning relief weapon in the WBC, particularly when pitchers are held to strict pitch limits in the early rounds.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Joe Ryan, TwinsA top trade candidate this offseason, it's not clear if Ryan will be camp with the Twins or a different team in the spring, but he will be on USA's roster. The 29 year old had a 3.42 ERA in 171 innings in 2025 and was dominant in the first half before fading a bit down the stretch.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Tarik Skubal, TigersSkubal joins Skenes and Ryan to give Team USA an impressive rotation. He's coming off consecutive Cy Young Award victories, having most recently compiled a 187 ERA+ and a 6.5 Wins Above Replacement, and will be entering his walk year once his WBC commitments conclude.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RP Mason Miller, PadresMiller will be logging his first WBC appearance. He's solidifed himself as one of the best and most electric relievers in the sport over the last three years, notching a 147 ERA+ and a 3.78 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Miller is expected to remain in the bullpen in 2026, though there were previously rumors he might transition back to the rotation.RP David Bednar, YankeesBednar gives manager Mark DeRosa yet another high-leverage option, joining Miller as Team USA arms with substantive closing experience. Bednar recovered from a year-long swoon in style, posting a 184 ERA+ in 62 games split between the Pirates and Yankees.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    SP Logan Webb, GiantsWith Webb joining Skenes and Skubal, the case can be made the three best American-born starting pitchers will be in USA's roster for the WBC. Webb has led baseball in innings each of the last three years and he has three straight top-six finishes in the Cy Young voting to his name. He also set a new career high with an NL-leading 224 strikeouts in 2025.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The first round of the 2025 College Football Playoff concludes Saturday night when No. 5 Oregon hosts No. 12 James Madison at Autzen Stadium. With one of college football's most prominent home-field advantages and a loaded roster on their side, the Ducks are commanding favorites to advance to the Orange Bowl, where No. 4 Texas Tech awaits the winner. But the Sun Belt champion Dukes will head to the Pacific Northwest with their sights set on what would be a legendary upset.They come from different backgrounds, but the Ducks and Dukes stand side by side in the FBS rankings for scoring offense and scoring defense. Both rank inside the top 10.These sides also have something in common in that they will say goodbye to coaches at the end of their postseason runs. James Madison coach Bob Chesney will depart to take the UCLA job at the end of the CFP, and both of Oregon's coordinators -- Will Stein (Kentucky) and Tosh Lupoi (California) -- are set to begin their duties as Power Four head coaches once the campaign closes.A win for Oregon would be its first in the playoff since its expansion to 12 teams. It would also help remove the bitter taste left over from last postseason when the Ducks squandered their No. 1 seed and dropped out of the CFP in the quarterfinals.\n  Oregon vs. James Madison: Need to know  Healthy Ducks are dangerous Ducks: If Oregon gets closer to full strength ahead of its playoff run, it could be in for a long stay in the bracket. A host of Ducks participated in practice this week after missing extended time with injuries. That includes the wide receiver trio of Dakorien Moore, Gary Bryant Jr. and Evan Stewart. Moore missed the final four games of the regular season after hurting his knee in practice, Bryant sat the final three games and Stewart has not played due to an injury he suffered in the offseason. Running back Jayden Limar and cornerback Sione Laulea could also return to the lineup.FCS to CFP in four years: James Madison debuted at the FBS level just four years ago when former Dukes coach Curt Cignetti oversaw a successful transition from the FCS ranks. Between Cignetti and Bob Chesney, this program benefitted from two outstanding coaches in an unfathomable rise to the top of the Sun Belt and, ultimately, to the CFP. The Dukes have won no fewer than eight games in a season since making the jump to Division I's highest subdivision, and they made their first appearance in the CFP Top 25 rankings ahead of conference championship week.Survived the gauntlet: Oregon played three of its toughest games in the final month of the season and won each of them, and suddenly the Oct. 11 loss to Indiana is far in the rearview mirror. The wins over Iowa, USC and Washington helped the Ducks re-establish themselves as national championship contenders and launched them into the No. 5 seed, which sets them up for arguably the most favorable path to the title game of any team outside the top four seeds.\nSoft schedule, decidedly dominant: According to ESPN FPI, James Madison played the 121st-toughest schedule in the country thus far. Only 15 teams faced a lighter load of opponents. Does that mean the Dukes' dominance has to be taken with a grain of salt? Saturday will put that idea to the test. Running back Wayne Knight torched defenses for a Sun Belt-best 1,263 rushing yards, defensive lineman Sahir West racked up 14 tackles for loss and dual-threat quarterback Alonza Barnett III passed for 21 touchdowns and ran for 14 more. In all, the Dukes boasted the nation's No. 10 scoring offense and No. 10 scoring defense. But now they have to prove they can do it against a national championship contender.  Where to watch Oregon vs. James Madison live  Date: Saturday, Dec. 20 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: Autzen Stadium -- Eugene, OregonTV: TNT | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Oregon vs. James Madison prediction, picks  \nA staple of the Dan Lanning era at Oregon is that when the Ducks are decidedly more talented than their opponent, they leave no doubt of it on the scoreboard. James Madison is far better than the trio of non-conference foes that Oregon pounded into the dirt by a combined score of 169-23, but is it really much stronger than the Big Ten bottom-dwellers that stood no chance against this powerhouse, either? The Dukes fell by two touchdowns in their lone regular-season matchup against a Power Four team, and this one should be even more lopsided than the 28-14 loss to Louisville.

    "body": "\nThe penultimate 'Thursday Night Football' game of the season will see the Los Angeles Rams visiting the Seattle Seahawks to kick off NFL Week 16. This is the rubber match between the franchises as their all-time series is tied 28-28 after the Rams won their Week 11 matchup. Seattle (11-3) is coming off an 18-16 victory over Indianapolis on Sunday, marking the team's fourth straight victory. L.A. has won two in a row, most recently defeating Detroit, 41-34, in Week 15, which clinched a playoff berth for the Rams. Seattle would lock up a postseason spot with a victory. OL Charles Cross (hamstring) is out for Seattle. DL Braden Fiske (ankle) is active for Los Angeles, but WR Davante Adams (hamstring) is inactive. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Lumen Field in Seattle. L.A. has won four of the last five overall matchups, as well as four of the last five meetings in Seattle. The latest Seahawks vs. Rams odds have Seattle as 1.5-point home favorites, while the over/under for total points is 42.5, a 4-point drop from opening at 46.5 as both heavy rain and winds are expected at kickoff. Both teams are 10-4 against the spread this season. Before making any Rams vs. Seahawks picks, make sure to check out the 'Thursday Night Football' predictions from SportsLine NFL expert Larry Hartstein.New users can target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets if your bet wins, on picks like Matthew Stafford going Over 230.5 passing yards yards.

They have won seven of the last 10 games, while covering in eight of those contests. The Rams defense flustered Sam Darnold into four interceptions in Los Angeles' Week 11 win, which is Darnold's most picks since his infamous \"seeing ghosts\" game in 2019. While both teams rank in the top five in both scoring offense and scoring defense, the biggest difference between the two lies in giveaways and takeaways. Los Angeles' +9 turnover differential ranks in the top five of the NFL, while Seattle has a -1 mark as it's committed the second-most turnovers (23) in the NFL. See which team to back at SportsLine, and bet Darnold to go Over 0.5 passing interceptions at DraftKings here:\nWhy the Seahawks can coverA major component of L.A.'s offense is out in Davante Adams (hamstring), who leads the league in receiving touchdowns. That will make things easier for an already elite defense, as Seattle is No. 2 in points allowed and allows the fewest yards per pass attempt and second-fewest yards per rush attempt. The Seahawks are equally as potent through the air on offense as they are in defending the pass on defense, as Seattle leads the NFL in yards per pass attempt. Thus, it connects on big passing plays like no other team, and the Rams' defense is exploitable in that area. L.A. just allowed its second-most passing yards (326) of the season in Week 15, while the Rams gave up their most points of the year (34) in that contest. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks picksHartstein has analyzed Seahawks vs. Rams from every angle and he's leaning Over on the point total.

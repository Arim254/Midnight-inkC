Judge beat out Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh and Cleveland Guardians third baseman José Ramírez for the award, the BBWAA announced Thursday night.As the voting results show, it was a close race between Judge and Raleigh: Player1st2nd3rd4th5th6th7th8th9th10thPointsAaron Judge, Yankees1713355Cal Raleigh, Mariners1317335José Ramírez, Guardians1965224Bobby Witt Jr., Royals91911215Tarik Skubal, Tigers1271043139Julio Rodríguez, Mariners188651136George Springer, Blue Jays176743125Garrett Crochet, Red Sox14564274Junior Caminero, Rays11312537Jeremy Peña, Astros47632Byron Buxton, Twins331730Nick Kurtz, Athletics1123429Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays11314Cody Bellinger, Yankees1117Maikel Garcia, Royals317Bo Bichette, Blue Jays115Riley Greene, Tigers113Aroldis Chapman, Red Sox11Yandy Díaz, Rays11Jacob Wilson, Athletics11This is Judge's second straight MVP and the third of his career (he also won in 2022). He is the 13th player with three MVPs. Only Barry Bonds (seven) and Shohei Ohtani (four), who won this year's National League MVP, have more. Judge is the fourth Yankee with three MVPs, joining Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio (1939, 1941, 1947), Yogi Berra (1951, 1954-55), and Mickey Mantle (1956-57, 1962).He joins Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers superstar who won National League MVP.Judge slashed .331/.457/.688 this season and led baseball in batting average by 20 points, on-base percentage by 58 points, and slugging percentage by 66 points. His 53 home runs were second in the AL behind Raleigh's 60. Judge's 9.7 WAR was 1.7 wins better than the next best player, per Baseball Reference's calculations. \n\n        \n            \n                Aaron Judge wins third MVP, but Yankees still searching for World Series ring during all-time great stretch\n                \n                    Matt Snyder                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRaleigh had a historic season and in fact is the first player other than Judge and Ohtani to receive a first-place AL MVP vote since José Abreu won the award in 2020. His 60 home runs are a new single-season record for a catcher, for a switch-hitter, and for a Seattle Mariner. Raleigh is one of only seven players with a 60-homer season. All told, Raleigh hit .247/.359/.589 and led the AL with 125 RBI, and also in games started at catcher (119) and innings caught (1,072). FanGraphs WAR, which includes catcher framing, pegs Raleigh as a 9.1 WAR player in 2025. That is third among all players behind Judge (10.1) and Ohtani (9.4). In just about any other year, Raleigh wins AL MVP with ease. Ramírez has finished in the top five of the MVP voting six times now, though he has yet to win the award. He had another tremendous season, hitting .283/.360/.503 with 30 home runs and 44 stolen bases. It was Ramírez's second straight and third career 30-30 season. His 5.8 WAR was sixth among AL position players. \nVoting for the BBWAA's awards (Rookie of the Year, Manager of the Year, Cy Young, MVP) takes place before the postseason. They are regular-season awards.\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

He is the second player in history with four career MVP awards, joining Barry Bonds, who won a record seven. Bonds (2001-04) is the only other player to win three MVPs consecutively.Last year, Ohtani joined Hall of Famer Frank Robinson as the only players to win MVP in each league. Ohtani won the 2021 and 2023 AL MVP awards with the Los Angeles Angels and now the 2024 and 2025 NL MVP awards with the Dodgers.\nHe joins Aaron Judge, the Yankees captain who won the American League MVP over Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh.Ohtani, 31, had another thunderous season at the plate, slashing .282/.392/.622 with 55 home runs and 20 stolen bases. He led the National League in slugging percentage (.622) and OPS (1.014), and all of baseball in runs scored (146) and total bases (380). Ohtani's 6.6 WAR as a position player only ranked eighth in baseball.In June, Ohtani returned to the mound following his September 2023 elbow surgery. He threw 47 innings in 14 closely monitored starts and was terrific, pitching to a 2.87 ERA with 62 strikeouts and only nine walks. Ohtani amassed 1.1 WAR as a pitcher. His combined 7.7 WAR was third highest in baseball.\nSchwarber, now a free agent, slugged an NL-leading 56 home runs in 2025. He also led baseball with 132 RBI and hit .240/.365/.563 overall. Schwarber finished with 4.7 WAR despite starting 154 of 162 games at DH.Soto got off to a relatively slow start to his first season with the Mets, but rallied to finish the year with new career highs in home runs (43) and stolen bases (38). He hit .263/.396/.525 and was worth 6.2 WAR.Voting for the BBWAA's awards (Rookie of the Year, Manager of the Year, Cy Young, MVP) takes place before the postseason.

    "body": "\n        Cleveland Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase and right-handed starter Luis L. Ortiz have both pleaded not guilty in a betting scandal.Both pitchers were indicted on charges stemming from alleged gambling misconduct -- specifically manipulating bets on individual pitches. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York announced the charges on Sunday and unsealed the indictment at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn. The Department of Justice has charged the pair with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy. Ortiz made his first court appearance Monday and was released on $500,000 bond after pleading not guilty, according to the Associated Press. He is restricted from traveling outside Boston, where he has a home, other than court appearances in New York or to meet his attorney in Cleveland. Ortiz was also ordered to surrender his passport.Clase, meanwhile, pleaded not guilty in a Brooklyn courthouse on Thursday after returning to the United States. He was released on a $600,000 bond and will be under GPS surveillance, according to the AP. Clase surrendered his passport and is not allowed to gamble or travel outside of New York and Ohio.\nBoth men are due back in court on Dec. 2. Clase's alleged actions date back to May of 2023, while Oritz's began in June of 2025. Furthermore, Clase's actions are alleged to have benefitted bettors by a sum of $700,000, while Ortiz's accrued to the benefit of co-conspiring gamblers by a sum of $60,000. Overall, bettors conspiring with the pair made at least $450,000 from betting platforms, prosecutors allege. Clase is alleged to have communicated with bettors via text messages during games. The pair could face up to 65 years in prison if convicted on all charges. The indictment reads: \"The charges in the indictment are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment on the wire fraud conspiracy count, 20 years' imprisonment on the honest services wire fraud conspiracy count, five years' imprisonment on the conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery count, and 20 years' imprisonment on the money laundering conspiracy count.\"Clase, 27, was one of two Guardians pitchers placed on administrative leave over the summer while the league investigated potential misdoing. Ortiz was also placed on leave several weeks earlier. Both Clase and Ortiz had their leaves extended in late August through the rest of the 2025 regular season. \"MLB contacted federal law enforcement at the outset of its investigation and has fully cooperated throughout the process,\" the league said in a statement to ESPN. \"We are aware of the indictment and today's arrest, and our investigation is ongoing.\"\nThe Guardians said they will \"continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.\"\n        \n            \n                How can MLB address prop betting problem?

The next day, Clase is alleged to have asked one of the co-conspiring bettors to who won money on the April 12 pitch to \"send some of it to DR,\" seemingly referring to Clase's home country of the Dominican Republic, \"for repairs at the country house.\" April 26, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $11,000 on a Clase pitch that was clocked slower than 97.95 mph. May 11, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $11,000 on a Clase pitch that was called a ball.May 13, 2025: Bettors allegedly won approximately $3,500 on a Clase pitch that was a ball and was slower than 99.45 mph. May 17, 2025: This is one of the games in which Clase is alleged to have used his cell phone to coordinate with one or more bettors during the game. Bettors on this date are alleged to have won roughly $10,000 on a Clase pitch that was clocked slower then 97.95 mph and called a ball.On or about May 20, 2025: Clase is alleged to have directed a co-conspiring bettor to communicate with an associate, who subsequently directed the bettor to send $2,000 to an individual in the Dominican Republic. On or about May 28, 2025: Bettors wagered roughly $4,000 that a specific pitch by Clase would be a ball. The pitch did indeed appear to be out of the strike zone, but the batter swung and missed for a strike. The indictment reads: \"Approximately 20 minutes after Bettor-I lost the wager on May 28, 2025, Bettor-I sent a text message to the defendant EMMANUEL CLASE DE LA CRUZ-a .gif image of a man hanging himself with toilet paper. Even though the Cleveland Guardians won the game, approximately 10 minutes later, CLASE responded to Bettor-I with a .gif image of a sad puppy dog face.\"Ortiz is alleged to have joined Clase's scheme in June of 2025. Some of Ortiz's specific actions highlighted by the debate include: On or about June 15, 2025: Ortiz is alleged to have agreed to throw his first pitch of the second inning for a ball in exchange for $5,000 from Clase. This made approximately $26,000 for two co-conspiring bettors. On or about June 27, 2025: Ortiz agreed to throw his first pitch of the third inning for a ball in exchange for approximately $7,000. Bettors are alleged to have made about $37,000 off the pitch. Ortiz has denied all allegations against him and claimed he \"has never, and would never, improperly influence a game -- not for anyone and not for anything.\"\n\"Luis is and always has been a fierce competitor. He has always given his best effort in every inning of every game. Those who have played with him know this. And the government's investigation, including discussions with Luis' teammates, supports this as well,\" his lawyer told CBS Sports in a statement. \"...There is no credible evidence Luis knowingly did anything other than try to win games, with every pitch and in every inning. Luis looks forward to fighting these charges in court. The government's case is weak and circumstantial. He will defend himself, and he will be prevail.\"Ortiz's lawyer also said that all payments and money transfers were \"for lawful activities.\"\"Emmanuel Clase has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win,\" the closer's attorney told CBS Sports in a statement. \"Emmanuel is innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.\"\nClase, who did not pitch after July 26, appeared in 48 games prior to the deactivation. He had amassed a 3.23 ERA (130 ERA+) and a 3.92 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His contributions had been worth an estimated 0.7 Wins Above Replacement, according to Baseball Reference's calculations. Ortiz made 16 starts before his suspension, going 4-9 with a 4.36 ERA.\"Professional athletes, like Luis Leandro Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase de la Cruz hold a position of trust-not only with their teammates and their professional leagues, but with fans who believe in fair play,\" United States Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr. said in a statement. \"As alleged, the defendants sold that trust to gamblers by fixing pitches.  In doing so, the defendants deprived the Cleveland Guardians and Major League Baseball of their honest services.  They defrauded the online betting platforms where the bets were placed.  And they betrayed America's pastime.  Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.  Today's charges make clear that our Office will continue to vigorously prosecute those who corrupt sports through illegal means.\"\nAs with all such proceedings, defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. The indictment comes just weeks after Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier was arrested as part of an NBA betting scandal. Rozier and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained insider information about games, including which players were healthy and active, and passed it along to bettors. More than $200,000 in bets were placed on Rozier's \"under\" line across multiple prop bets during a March 23, 2023, game in which he left after playing less than 10 minutes. Damon Jones, a former NBA player, was also indicted and accused of passing along inside information, including about LeBron James.While sports gambling has been legalized across the country, MLB (and other leagues) have rules that prohibit certain behavior. MLB, for example, does not allow players to gamble on diamond sports, even of other teams. In 2024, MLB banned former San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for life and suspended four other players -- Athletics righty Michael Kelly, Padres lefty Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies infielder José Rodriguez, and Arizona Diamondbacks lefty Andrew Saalfrank -- after they were discovered to have bet on baseball games not involving their teams.\nBack in May, commissioner Rob Manfred reinstated several of the most notorious gambling-related rule violaters in league history -- Pete Rose and several members of the 1919 Black Sox -- from MLB's permanently ineligible list on the grounds that the lifetime bans ended with the player's death. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        New York Knicks star guard Jalen Brunson is expected to miss Friday night's matchup against the Miami Heat with a Grade 1 right ankle sprain, per ESPN. The injury isn't serious, as he'll be evaluated on a day-to-day basis, which is a huge sigh of relief for the Knicks.Brunson sustained the injury in the closing minutes of New York's 124-107 loss to the Orlando Magic Wednesday night. With 1:54 left in the fourth quarter Brunson was attacking the rim, and as he attempted to plant his foot to elevate off the floor he landed on the foot of Orlando big man Wendell Carter Jr. Brunson popped up quickly and shot both of his free throws, though he had a considerable limp. After converting one of the two shots from the line, Brunson intentionally fouled Jalen Suggs to get out of the game, and immediately walked to the Knicks' locker room without going to the bench.Here's where the injury occurred:\nAfter the game, Knicks coach Mike Brown said he didn't know anything other than Brunson turned his right ankle on the play. The All-Star guard was seen exiting Madison Square Garden in a walking boot with crutches following the loss. It's the same ankle Brunson injured last season that forced him to miss 15 games, but it sounds as though this situation is nowhere near that severe.Brunson's status is a positive outcome after an embarrassing loss to the Magic. Brunson was still in the game despite the game decidedly out of reach, which may raise questions about why he was still out there in the first place. If this injury was more severe that would certainly be a bigger plot point, but the good thing is that becomes a moot point with him not expected to miss much time.\nA rejuvenated offenseKnowing Brunson isn't going to miss a ton of time also ensures the Knicks can keep building on the momentum they've built over the last six games. Before that stinker against the Magic, the Knicks were on a five-game winning streak. They have the second-best offense in the league, implementing Brown's new system that has the Knicks taking the third-most 3s in the league. That's a massive change from New York ranking 27th in that same category a season ago, but it's contributed to the Knicks' success so far.It took some time for everyone to adjust, which contributed to the 2-3 record New York started the season with, but over the last batch of games things have been clicking offensively. They're not just taking more 3s, this new system has also taken the ball out of Brunson's hands slightly. In the past, the Knicks ran a ton of isolation plays for their lead guard to great success. Brunson dominated the ball, and while that's still the case, we've seen a slight decrease so far this season.\nSeasonTime of possession (seconds)Isolation frequency2025-267.811.7%2024-258.617.3%2023-248.615.1%2022-238.513.2%The Knicks have been humming along with this new system, and can continue to do so knowing that Brunson won't be sidelined for too long. If there's one adjustment the Knicks need to make, though, it's getting more production out of their second unit.The Knicks' bench unit has been a weakness in what's been an otherwise strong start. That second unit ranks 25th in scoring, and as the grind of the season picks up, they'll need guys like Josh Hart and Jordan Clarkson to produce more.Hart's production has taken a step back this season, and while he's never been a high volume 3-point shooter he's certainly been more efficient inside the arc. After averaging 13.6 points a season ago, he's managing just 8.4 points on 44.4% from the floor. Clarkson was brought in this summer to give the Knicks more scoring depth off the bench, but so far he's been streaky. He's a former Sixth Man of the Year, and is certainly capable of putting up 20 points on some nights. Both guys may just be adjusting -- and Hart did enter the regular season banged up -- but come April and May the Knicks are going to need those guys to give more than what they've been showing so far.But we haven't even reached the one-month mark on the season, so these are minor issues. The positive is that the Knicks don't have to figure out how to carry on without Brunson for an extended period of time, and this top-tier offense they've been operating with can continue to build chemistry as New York tries to establish itself as the team to beat in the Eastern Conference.\n            ",

Jackson said he tweaked his knee in last week's win over the Minnesota Vikings but that the issue is \"getting better\" ahead of the Week 11 divisional clash with the Cleveland Browns.Coach John Harbaugh told reporters on Wednesday that Jackson \"should be OK\" after missing practice early in the week.Baltimore has received a jolt, offensively, since the return of Lamar Jackson, as the return of the former MVP to the lineup in Week 9 helped the Ravens to consecutive wins over the Dolphins and Vikings. Those wins have Baltimore just one game back of the falling Steelers for the AFC North division lead, but as they prepared to face the Browns on Sunday in an effort to get back to .500 on the season, they initially did so without Jackson. \nJackson missed three games with a hamstring injury suffered in a Week 4 loss to the Chiefs, but he looked good in his return to the field. On the season, he's completed 70.1% of his passes for 1,249 yards, 15 touchdowns and one interception. Jackson's return, coupled with the run game and defense returning to form, has Baltimore looking like a threat in the AFC again, but his health will likely be the determining factor in the overall success to the team. Jackson took some big hits in Sunday's win over Minnesota, and the Ravens will have to establish a balance between their need to keep Jackson healthy to achieve their long-term goals of winning a Super Bowl. \nWednesday's absence appears to have been a matter of precaution, and Ravens fans will hope his return to the practice field on Thursday indicates he will be under center against Cleveland on Sunday. \n            \n    ",

Also New York has won two of the last three meetings with New England, so you never know what could happen in this league and with this rivalry.\nWhere to watch Patriots vs. Jets liveDate: Thursday, Nov. 13 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Gillette Stadium -- Foxborough, MassachusettsStream: PrimeFollow: CBS Sports AppOdds: Patriots -12.5; O/U 43.5 (via FanDuel)Jets vs. Patriots: Need to knowRookies are making an impact. The main headline from New England's win in Tampa was the impact made by first-year players. The Patriots became the first team to have rookies score three 50-yard touchdowns from scrimmage since 1998. TreVeyon Henderson had 55-yard and 69-yard touchdowns, while Kyle Williams caught a 72-yard touchdown pass. Henderson has finally arrived, as he recorded 150 yards from scrimmage.More of that special special teams play. The Jets couldn't have defeated the Browns last week without special teams. They became the first NFL team since 2017 to have a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown in the same game, and the first team since 2011 to have back-to-back possessions with a kick return touchdown and punt return touchdown. Kene Nwangwu ran back a kick 99 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter, then Isaiah Williams ran back a 74-yard punt return touchdown following a Browns three-and-out. Speaking of special teams, we have to give a shoutout to kicker Nick Folk as well. He's one of two kickers to have not missed a field goal this season, going a perfect 19 of 19. He hasn't missed an extra point yet either. The Jets will need good play from special teams if they want to upset the Patriots. Mike Vrabel's historic start. The former NFL Coach of the Year is tied in having the best 10-game start for a coach who inherited a 13-loss team in NFL history. Andy Reid started 9-2 in his first season with the Kansas City Chiefs, and finished 11-5. Four for IV. The Jets aren't known for their defense, but Will McDonald IV racked up four sacks vs. the Browns last week. He became the first Jet to record four sacks in a game since John Abraham in 2001! No other Jets player has more than 2.5 sacks this season. Jets vs. Patriots prediction, pick\nThere's too much going against the Jets in this matchup. The defense has recorded just one takeaway all season, Justin Fields has thrown fewer than 60 yards in three out of his last four starts and Garrett Wilson is expected to miss a few weeks with his knee injury. I don't believe the Patriots will win this game by 40 points, but I'll take them at -12.5. Pick: Patriots -12.5; Under 43.5\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        It's fair to say that Week 12 of the 2025 college football season is shaping up to be one of the most important slates yet. There's a lot on the line as multiple teams jockey for spots in the 12-team College Football Playoff and, now that rankings are released weekly, we have an even better idea of how the landscape looks. With that in mind, there are several prominent programs facing make-or-break games this weekend. For instance, neither No. 9 Notre Dame nor No. 22 Pittsburgh could brunt another loss and still keep their playoff hopes intact -- especially not Notre Dame, which does not have the benefit of a conference championship at the end of the year. So it's fascinating that Notre Dame and Pittsburgh must face one another Saturday. No. 10 Texas and No. 11 Oklahoma don't play each other, but they do have to contend with ranked conference foes and, with two losses already, their respective seasons are likely on the line. It's a lot of action for one weekend of college football and the CFP Rankings will almost assuredly look entirely different next Tuesday. \nWe here at CBS Sports have been overreacting to each college football weekend for a while now. Let's try and manifest some into existence for a change ahead of the 12th week of the season. Lane Kiffin shouldn't go anywhere \nNo. 7 Ole Miss continues its push for a playoff appearance Saturday as it hosts a Florida team searching for a new coach after the midseason firing of Billy Napier. Ironically, Kiffin's name has received plenty of buzz in connection with Florida's vacancy. Kiffin has also been linked to LSU and there's been a prevailing thought -- for quite some time -- that he would jump at the chance to fill a high-level opening. This is not the year to do that. \nKiffin's Rebels should dispatch the Gators handily. In that, Kiffin should realize how good he has it at Ole Miss. He could do no wrong in Oxford. He has steadily built Ole Miss into a legitimate national competitor while teams like Florida have been mired in decades of inconsistency. Why would he leave one rebuild for another? LSU is a little more stable -- on paper, at least -- but there have been plenty of red flags cropping up in the early days of its coaching search, including interference from the state's governor and the \"will they, won't they\" nature of Verge Ausberry's promotion to athletic director. Going to either Florida or LSU would also increase the level of expectations that Kiffin faces. LSU just fired a coach who produced multiple double-digit win seasons because he was unable to win a title. Kiffin could cruise at Ole Miss with consistent nine or 10-win campaigns. \nIt just seems like an unnecessary risk when he already has it made with the Rebels. Pittsburgh is championship quality \nPittsburgh has flown under the radar all season even though it has landed inside the top 25 of each of the first two College Football Playoff rankings. The Panthers have quietly won five games in a row to emerge as a real contender for the ACC Championship Game and beyond. Saturday will serve as their coming out party. It's an ideal chance to make some noise, as they welcome No. 9 Notre Dame to Acrisure Stadium in a colossal matchup between two programs that really need the win. \nThe nation will recognize Pitt's legitimacy after it takes down the Fighting Irish. This will be Notre Dame's second road test since the start of October. The only other away game the Irish played in that span was at one-win Boston College. Outside of that, Notre Dame has lost its only road contest against a ranked opponent, though that came all the way back on Aug. 31 at Miami. Pittsburgh will be able to limit Notre Dame's explosive rushing attack with a defense that is tops in the ACC against the run. If the Panthers can put the onus on Notre Dame quarterback CJ Carr -- especially in what should be a hostile environment -- they can pull out the stunner. \nThe CFP's Group of Six team will come from outside the American\nConventional wisdom this season has regarded the eventual winner of the American Conference as the Group of Six's most likely College Football Playoff representative. After all, the American is filled to the brim with seven and eight-win teams, some of which -- like South Florida -- have marquee wins over Power Four programs on their résumés. Memphis was the highest-ranked (outside the top 25) Group of Six program in the initial College Football Playoff rankings and South Florida followed suit on Nov. 11. Navy, Tulane and North Texas are all still in the hunt, as well. The problem with the American is that it continues to cannibalize itself. Navy lost to North Texas. North Texas lost to South Florida. South Florida lost to Memphis. Memphis -- somehow -- lost to UAB and dropped a pivotal game against Tulane. Tulane suffered a bad setback against UTSA. \nIt's a mess, and it's going to get messier Saturday when South Florida drops its road game to Navy. That will allow a program outside of the American Conference, like James Madison, to enter pole position. James Madison remains unblemished in conference play and its lone loss on the year came by 14 points against Louisville, a potential ACC champion, on the road. If the Dukes can finish undefeated and win the Sun Belt, they should have a compelling case against whatever champion emerges from the beat-up American.    Jerry Mack will be a top coaching candidate one day \nIf you're not familiar with Jerry Mack, it's time to learn his name. The former assistant coach at Tennessee and with the Jacksonville Jaguars in the NFL got his first crack at being an FBS head coach at Kennesaw State. \nIn just his first year in that capacity, and in Kennesaw State's second season as an FBS program, he has the Owls looking like a favorite to win Conference USA. This just one year removed from a 2-10 campaign, as well. Kennesaw State is 5-0 in league play this year and, on Saturday, Mack's squad will take a commanding lead in the standings when it downs fellow undefeated C-USA opponent Jacksonville State. Mack may not be a hot coaching name this cycle, but he will be down the road if he sustains the success. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers are slowly but surely getting healthier, and Brock Purdy is the latest addition. Out since Week 4 with a toe injury, Purdy will return to the lineup in Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, coach Kyle Shanahan said according to Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area.Purdy, 25, initially suffered a reported \"variant of turf toe\" -- as well as a shoulder injury -- in Week 1, and he missed Weeks 2 and 3. He returned in Week 4 but aggravated the toe injury and has not played since. It's been, as Shanahan described it in late October, a \"sensitive situation.\" Purdy was listed as questionable but ultimately ended up being inactive in Week 10, too.\n        \n            \n                Turf toe injury: What is it? Why can't Joe Burrow, other NFL stars play through it? Medical experts explain\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMac Jones played solidly for the most part in Purdy's stead, accumulating a 5-3 record in eight starts this season. After winning each of his first three starts, Jones had six turnovers -- including five interceptions -- over his past five games, during which the 49ers went gone 2-3. Overall, Jones ranks 10th in yards per attempt this season, but his 13-6 touchdown to interception ratio is just 23rd out of 33 qualifying quarterbacks.Purdy, meanwhile, has thrown for for 586 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions in two games this season. A Pro Bowler after a historically efficient 2023 season, Purdy had a bit more of a down 2024 but still finished third in yards per attempt. Purdy is a more aggressive downfield passer and, depending on the health of his toe, a more mobile option than Jones; Purdy's 323 rushing yards last season ranked 11th among quarterbacks.\nAfter a lengthy recovery process, Purdy was once again officially a limited participant at Wednesday's practice. Shanahan, however, said it'd be an \"aggressive practice\" for Purdy, though technically not a full one.\"I think each week it's gotten better, with last week being the best,\" Shanahan said Wednesday, per the team's transcript. \"Each week has been different. So, if he takes a big step forward this week, like he did last week, he should have a good chance to play.\"Shanahan added it would not be a hard decision to reinstate Purdy as his starter. \"We've got a lot of confidence in Brock, and we know Brock will play at a high level too as long as he's healthy,\" he said.\nThe 49ers are 6-4 this season despite a bevy of injuries -- the team is also expected to have wide receiver Ricky Pearsall back this week -- and are currently eighth in the NFC standings, one spot out of the playoffs. San Francisco, which beat Arizona 16-15 in Week 3, has hit a bit of an easier patch in its schedule, with games against the Panthers, Browns and Titans following this weekend's trip to Arizona.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        'Thursday Night Football' kicks off NFL Week 11 with an AFC East rivalry as the New England Patriots host the New York Jets at 8:15 p.m. ET. Many bettors in the NFL player props market will gravitate towards New England, with it having the likes of Drake Maye, TreVeyon Henderson and Stefon Diggs. But a winning 'Thursday Night Football' SGP could also involve Jets standout running back Breece Hall and his NFL prop predictions. Coming off a season-high of 42 receiving yards, Hall has an over/under of 15.5 receiving yards among his TNF props. He also won't have to compete with receiver Garrett Wilson for touches, as the Jets wideout was placed on IR on Thursday due to a knee injury.It may be helpful with your Patriots vs. Jets SGP to know that no team has allowed more receptions to running backs this year than New England. In addition to including Thursday Night Football props in an NFL same-game parlay, you can also include picks versus the spread, on the money line and with the total.

The second-year quarterback has gone over his passing yards prop in eight of his last 10 games, averaging 255.5 yards over this stretch. Maye should see very little deterrence from a Jets defense which recently traded away its two best players in DT Quinnen Williams and CB Sauce Gardner.Even with those players for most of the season, New York has the fewest interceptions, the sixth-fewest sacks and allows the seventh-highest passer rating. With New England having multiple injured running backs, including Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) being inactive, look for it to lean on Maye's arm over the ground game. Maye is projected to have 271.4 passing yards.

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                      If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                  Ready to get off on the right foot? Here's how to approach every play for this week in Non-PPR leagues.

Yuracheck will replace former chairman Mack Rhoades, who stepped away from his role on Thursday. Utah athletic director Mark Harlan will also rejoin the selection committee after previously serving a one-year term during the 2023 season. This change comes just two days after the CFP unveiled its second set of rankings and less than a month before the final 12-team playoff field is unveiled on Dec. 7.\"We are deeply appreciative of Mack Rhoades' leadership and service as Chair of the College Football Playoff Selection Committee this season,\" College Football Playoff executive director Rich Clark said in a statement. \"Mack has informed us of his decision to step down for personal reasons, and our thoughts are with him and his family during this time. \"We are pleased to announce that Hunter Yurachek will assume the role of Selection Committee Chair, effective immediately. Hunter's experience, integrity, and commitment to the game make him exceptionally well-suited to lead the committee as it continues its important work throughout the remainder of the season.\"\nYurachek has served as an athletic director for 15 years and has been at Arkansas since 2017. He also had stints directing the athletic departments at Coastal Carolina (2010-15) and Houston (2015-17). Yurachek has presided over two coaching changes during his time at Arkansas. He hired former boss Sam Pittman in 2020 to replace Chad Morris and then fired Pittman midway through the 2025 season. The Razorbacks are actively searching for a new coach. \nHarlan, meanwhile, has been at Utah since 2018 after a six-year stint as the athletic director at South Florida.   \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        There is not much worse as a Dynasty Fantasy Football contender than having one of your young core players suffer a significant injury in the second half of the season. Contenders with Garrett Wilson on their roster know exactly what I am talking about. Wilson was the number seven wide receiver in Fantasy through the first six weeks of the season. He hasn't scored a Fantasy point since, appearing in just one game, and isn't expected to be a contributor until the Fantasy playoffs, at least.The thing that complicates this is that he is 25 years old and still a valuable piece in Dynasty. He is currently my WR22, and that is factoring in almost no production the rest of this year. Since rebuilders don't care about 2025 points, he is even more valuable than that. This is the kind of player who could land you an immediate contributor, but also the type of talent you could regret trading for the next five years. Wilson could have a new quarterback in 2026, and he undoubtedly has top-12 upside. This week was a one-man mailbag on Fantasy Football Today Dynasty, where I answered your Dynasty questions about Wilson and much more. To have your question answered in the next mailbag, send an email to fftdynasty@paramount.com. I face this dilemma in our 14-team Dynasty league, and the choice I have made is to try to sell. I've made a couple of offers, trying to turn Wilson into a star WR by adding picks. If that doesn't work, I'll be trying to see if I can just turn him into a WR2 and a future pick. It is hard to talk about specific players to target because the guys you should be targeting are the good wide receivers in your league who are on the rosters of non-contenders. \nAs a general rule, I would be looking for someone you believe can be a top 18 wide receiver for the rest of this season. I would exclude someone like Davante Adams, because I don't want to trade a stud wide receiver entering his prime for one who is 32 years old. The easiest way to find targets would be to check out the trade charts over at SportsLine and compare values. One final note, this is not just an article for contenders with Garrett Wilson. Any Dynasty manager who is not contending should at least be doing a price check on Wilson. There is a very good chance his value goes up before your Fantasy team plays a meaningful game again. \nAs always, you can get my weekly updated Dynasty Trade Charts over on SportsLine. There you'll find trade values for both Superflex and One-QB trades to help you dominate your Dynasty league.Here are my updated Dynasty Quarterback Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Running Back Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Wide Receiver Rankings:Here are my updated Dynasty Tight End Rankings:\n            ",

The father of this baby boy is New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, and the news broke to the public just as Diggs was taking the field for the Patriots' prime-time game against the New York Jets.It's unclear when Cardi B actually had the child, but she confirmed with an Instagram post that she had a newborn, and said on her Instagram story that it was a baby boy. Check it out, here:\n\n\"My life has always been a combination of different chapters and different seasons. My last chapter was the beginning of a new season. Starting over is never easy but it's been so worth it! I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world, and one more reason to be the best version of me, one more reason to love me more than anything else or anyone else so I can continue giving my babies the love and life they deserve. This next chapter is Me vs. Me! It's me against all odds me against everything meant to get in my way. I've started prepping for tour getting my body right getting my mind right. There's nothing thats gonna stop me from giving you guys the performance of a life time! I've learned i've healed, and im loving the woman i've become! Thats what this next era means to me and i'm stepping into it better than ever.\"Back in September, Cardi B announced on \"CBS Mornings\" that she was expecting a child with Diggs. \"I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong. I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work. But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, me and my man, we're very supportive of each other,\" she said.\n\"Her man\" has been on fire this season. Despite tearing his ACL just over a year ago, Diggs has caught 50 passes for 554 yards and three touchdowns in 10 games played this season. The four-time Pro Bowler has caught touchdowns in three consecutive games for the first time since 2022, and just became the seventh active player to reach 11,000 career receiving yards.\n            \n    ",

The Grizzlies are just 2-12 ATS versus teams that win over 55% of the games.

He is among the numerous potential candidates to replace Brian Callahan, who was fired by the Titans midseason after he opened the 2025 campaign with a 1-5 start.Garrett has not been a head coach since 2019 and last worked on the sidelines in 2021 as the New York Giants' offensive coordinator. The 2016 NFL Coach of the Year spent the entirety of his head-coaching career with the Cowboys from 2011-19, where he went 85-67 and won three NFC East crowns. Garrett, 59, was linked to college jobs after his New York ouster but never returned to coaching. He has been a regular on NBC's NFL and Notre Dame football broadcasts since 2022.\n        \n            \n                Ranking head coaching vacancies: Which of these seven jobs is the most desirable?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile he logged double-digit wins in three separate seasons with the Cowboys and received a long leash from owner Jerry Jones, Garrett's tenure flamed out after multiple years of inconsistency and a failure to advance deep in the playoffs. Dallas reached the postseason just three times throughout his tenure and never made it beyond the divisional round.\nGarrett's two-year run as the Giants' offensive coordinator was highly underwhelming. New York ranked No. 31 in points and yardage in both seasons, leading to a midseason firing in 2021.The failed run as the leader of the Giants' offense and the inability to contend for Super Bowls with high-end offensive talent in Dallas raises questions about Garrett's fit in Tennessee. The Titans would undoubtedly benefit from a bright offensive mind capable of developing rookie quarterback Cam Ward, and Garrett would be a risky hire in that regard.The Titans also requested or scheduled interviews with Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, former Cleveland Browns coach Kevin Stefanski, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Indianapolis Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo and former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, according to various reports. They opened their interview process with Morris on Monday and are expected to continue their process at least through the weekend with Stefanski set to interview on Saturday.\nIt remains to be seen how large of a player Tennessee will be in the John Harbaugh sweepstakes. The Baltimore Ravens fired their coach of 18 years on Tuesday, making him the immediate top available candidate on the market for the six open jobs.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Detroit Lions have fired offensive coordinator John Morton after just one season, the team announced. Morton, previously the passing game coordinator of the Denver Broncos, was hired to replace Ben Johnson, who left last offseason to become the Chicago Bears' coach. Under Johnson's tutelage, the Lions led the NFL with 33.2 points per game in 2024 en route to a 15-win season. This year, the Lions finished tied for fourth in scoring (28.3), third in passing yards and eighth in red zone efficiency but failed to reach the postseason for the first time since 2022, going just 9-8 on the heels of consecutive NFC North titles. The Lions went 12-5 in 2023, losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, and then went 15-2 in 2024, only to get upset in the divisional round by the Washington Commanders. The team had Super Bowl aspirations entering 2025, but fell well short of expectations. \n        \n            \n                One reason for each NFL non-playoff team to be optimistic: Premium draft picks, young quarterbacks and more\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLions coach Dan Campbell took over as the team's offensive play-caller prior to their Week 10 win over the Commanders. At the time, Campbell downplayed the change while saying that the team's play-calling was a collaborative effort. \n\"It was just, let's try something a little different,\" Campbell said at the time. \"Look, I know what I want to do, I know how I want to do it. Now, that being said, this is a collaborative effort. I was taking input from John Morton that whole time, and the other coaches.\" While that may have been true, it's clear now that Campbell wasn't happy with the direction of the Lions' offense. Meanwhile, Johnson enjoyed highly-successful season with the Bears that included an NFC North division title. Chicago will host the Green Bay Packers this weekend in the NFC wild card round. The Lions were just 20th in the NFL on third down and 14th in rushing despite having one of the league's best running back duos in Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. While Gibbs enjoyed a big season, Montgomery was carried the ball a career-low 158 times. \nMorton, 56, was a senior offensive assistant on Campbell's staff in Detroit in 2022 before two years in Denver. He had a previous stint as an offensive coordinator with the New York Jets in 2017 and also worked as an offensive assistant with three other teams -- the Las Vegas Raiders, New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens are making a major organizational change, as the franchise fired coach John Harbaugh Tuesday after 18 seasons. The move comes after the Ravens finished the 2025 campaign with an 8-9 record -- just Harbaugh's third losing season in Baltimore -- and failed to reach the postseason after opening the year with major expectations. Baltimore had a chance to clinch the AFC North title on Sunday night, but lost the win-and-in Week 18 showdown against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 26-24, on a last-second missed field goal. Harbaugh, who was under contract through 2028 after signing a new three-year deal last offseason, was the second-longest tenured coach in the NFL (behind Pittsburgh's Mike Tomlin) and is the winningest coach in Ravens history, going 180-113 during his time in Baltimore. The 63-year-old Harbaugh went 13-11 in the postseason, won Super Bowl XLVII against his brother, Jim, in 2013, and was named Coach of the Year in 2019. His eight road playoff victories are the most by a coach in NFL history, yet the Ravens made the AFC Championship just once following the franchise's second Super Bowl victory. In eight seasons with two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson leading the offense, the Ravens won just three postseason games and never made it past the conference championship round.\"Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach. Today I informed John that he has been relieved of his duties,\" Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement. \"This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, most importantly, as a great man of integrity. \n\"Throughout what I firmly believe is a Hall of Fame coaching career, John has delivered a Super Bowl championship to Baltimore and served as a steadfast pillar of humility and leadership. He and his family have deeply embedded themselves in this community. For these profound contributions, on and off the field, we should all be forever grateful.\"\n        \n            \n                What's next for the Ravens? Big questions for Lamar Jackson, John Harbaugh after disappointing 2025 season\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHarbaugh was reportedly confident he would return to Baltimore to chase a Lombardi Trophy in 2026, but he was not granted that opportunity. In a statement, Harbaugh said he was disappointed but filled with gratitude and appreciation. \"Well, I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today. It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION,\" Harbaugh said. \"Gratitude to the owner and organization who was willing to bring in a head coach who made his mark with Special Teams success. A difficult thing to do … and appreciation for all the moments, all these years, that are etched into eternity.\"\nWhile Harbaugh is out in Baltimore, he suddenly becomes the most attractive prospect on the coaching carousel -- including with the New York Giants. Harbaugh is \"expected to emerge as a favorite\" for the vacancy in New York, according to ESPN. According to CBS Sports Research, Harbaugh has the eighth-most wins (180) by a coach with a single team in NFL history. \nCoachTeamWinsRecordWin PctSeasonsYearsGamesGeorge HalasChicago Bears318318-148-31.6821920-196740497Bill BelichickNew England Patriots266266-121.6872000-202324387Don ShulaMiami Dolphins257257-133-2.6591970-199526392Tom LandryDallas Cowboys250250-162-6.6071960-198829418Curly LambeauGreen Bay Packers209209-104-21.6681921-194929334Chuck NollPittsburgh Steelers193193-148-1.5661969-199123342Mike TomlinPittsburgh Steelers193193-114-2.6282007-202519309John HarbaughBaltimore Ravens180180-113.6142008-202518293Ravens have fallen short of expectations in recent seasonsRecently, the Ravens acquired the reputation of being a regular-season juggernaut that failed when the stakes were high. When Jackson won his first NFL MVP in 2019, the Ravens earned the No. 1 seed in the AFC. However, they were upset by the Tennessee Titans in their first postseason matchup. After avenging that playoff loss to the Titans the very next year in the wild-card round, the Ravens fell to the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round, 17-3, while Jackson exited with an injury. The Ravens missed the playoffs in 2021 after finishing with an 8-9 record. Jackson started 12 games, but suffered a late-season ankle injury that forced him to miss the final four games of the year. The following season, Baltimore returned to the playoffs, but Jackson suffered a knee injury that held him out of the wild-card matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals. Tyler Huntley started in his place. In 2023, it appeared the stars were aligning for Baltimore. The Ravens clinched the AFC North with a 13-4 record, and Jackson won his second NFL MVP. Baltimore blew out the Houston Texans in the divisional round, setting up a date with Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game. However, the Ravens would commit three turnovers in a devastating 17-10 home loss. Jackson had another MVP-type campaign in 2024, but lost out on the award to Josh Allen of the Bills -- the same team that defeated the Ravens in the divisional round that season. \nHarbaugh won just four playoff games over the last 12 seasons after winning an NFL record nine in his first five seasons as coach. This season, the Ravens started 1-5 but rallied with a five-game winning streak after the bye week to get back into the playoff hunt. However, Harbaugh's group lost four of their final six games, capped off by the loss in Pittsburgh on Sunday night with the division on the line. \n            ",

The Red Raiders recently celebrated the addition of top transfer quarterback Brendan Sorsby with advertisements posted in Times Square. Texas Tech posted a welcome message on Times Square's famous digital billboards. \nSorsby is the gem of Texas Tech's 2026 transfer haul thus far. The former Cincinnati star ranks as the No. 2 player nationally and the No. 2 quarterback in 247Sports' Transfer Portal Rankings. He reportedly commanded a price tag of $5 million in name, image and likeness revenue, making him the highest-paid quarterback in college football. Sorsby enters his final year of collegiate eligibility after a breakout season with the Bearcats. The former Indiana starter initially transferred to Cincinnati ahead of the 2024 season and led the Bearcats to a 7-6 record in 2025 while throwing for 2,800 yards and a career-high 27 touchdowns to just five interceptions. He also rushed for 580 yards, a new personal best, and nine touchdowns while averaging 5.8 yards per carry. Texas Tech hopes that Sorsby can maintain its modern resurgence under coach Joey McGuire after the Red Raiders, who went all-in on the 2025 portal, won a Big 12 Championship Game and earned a top-four seed in the College Football Playoff. \nTexas Tech is also betting on Sorsby elevating its offensive ceiling. The Red Raiders were held scoreless while managing just 215 total yards of offense in their CFP debut against Oregon. Quarterback Behren Morton completed 18 of his 32 pass attempts for 137 yards with two interceptions. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Oregon has chased this moment for decades, cycling through eras defined by innovation, near-misses and a bit of recalibration. Now, as the Ducks prepare for the College Football Playoff semifinal against No. 1 Indiana at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta, the path to the program's first national championship no longer feels theoretical. It feels earned.Since Dan Lanning arrived in Eugene before the 2022 season, Oregon has built a consistent identity and trajectory that few programs in the country can claim: three straight seasons with at least 12 wins. Last year, the Ducks flirted with a breakthrough on the national stage, climbing to No. 1 in the rankings for much of the season, securing a Big Ten Championship and entering the CFP with an unbeaten record. But their run ended in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal against eventual national champion Ohio State.That loss stung not because it derailed the season, but because it revealed precisely where the Ducks still needed to improve: physicality against elite opponents and consistent execution in high-pressure moments.Fast forward to 2025, and Oregon has returned to the national conversation, this time with those lessons fully integrated into the roster, coaching approach and overall game plan.\nThe progress is no accident.Oregon is the only one of the four remaining CFP semifinalists with top-15 national recruiting classes in each of the past four cycles: fifth in 2025, third in 2024, ninth in 2023 and 13th in 2022. That doesn't even account for strategic transfer portal additions that have filled gaps and provided immediate impact. The Ducks entered the season ranked fifth in 247Sports Team Talent Composite. The other semifinalists? Miami (15th), Ole Miss (21st) and Indiana (72nd).After coming up short in previous title runs, including the near-misses of 2010 and 2014, the Ducks won't let this opportunity slip away again. Here are three reasons why Oregon is positioned to seize that long-awaited national championship.More CFP predictions: Why Ole Miss can win it all | Why Indiana can win it all | Why Miami can win it all\nBalanced excellence on both sidesChampionship teams aren't one-dimensional. Among the four remaining CFP semifinalists, only Indiana and Oregon rank inside the top 20 nationally in both offensive EPA per play and defensive EPA per play against FBS opponents this season. The Ducks are also the only semifinalist in the top 20 for both explosive play rate and limiting opponent explosive plays against FBS opponents. This balance gives Oregon multiple ways to win: they can sustain drives and grind in a possession game or flip a matchup with big plays when needed. Efficiency and Explosiveness (vs. FBS only)TeamEPA/PlayDef EPA/PlayExplosive RateOpp. Explosive RateIndiana0.25 (5th)0.20 (2nd)13.8% (18th)10.3% (t-31st)Oregon0.16 (t-15th)0.14 (t-6th)14.9% (t-9th)7.5% (2nd)Ole Miss0.19 (t-8th)-0.01 (t-54th)13.4% (t-23rd)10.7% (t-39th)Miami0.13 (t-23rd)0.14 (t-6th)12.2% (t-48th)8.3% (t-7th)In a national semifinal environment where every possession matters and mistakes are magnified, that versatility is invaluable -- Oregon is equipped to succeed regardless of how the game unfolds.Peach Bowl could determine the CFP championAccording to FanDuel's hypothetical national championship odds, Oregon (and Indiana) would be favored over both Ole Miss and Miami in the CFP title game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens -- a de facto home game for the Hurricanes. The Hoosiers are the toughest opponent standing between the Ducks and their first national title.Oregon already faced Indiana earlier this season in Eugene, falling 30‑20 in a game where Indiana physically dominated. If there's any doubt that Lanning will use that experience as motivation, consider the circumstances: Indiana coach Curt Cignetti has openly acknowledged how difficult it is to beat the same team twice in a year, admitting the previous result actually gives Oregon the edge.The Big Ten has set the standard in recent years of the CFP, winning the last two national championships: Michigan (2023) and Ohio State (2024). Both programs reached that breakthrough only after coming up painfully short the year prior. The Big Ten is guaranteed to have a finalist for the third year in a row and there's no reason Oregon can't be the next program to carry that banner.Best pass defense remaining in CFPFor all the attention Oregon gets for winning the lines of scrimmage, its secondary is what can truly disrupt opposing offenses and force them into one-dimensional play. The Ducks boast a 64.8% success rate on pass plays against FBS opponents, tied for third in the country and 6.1% higher than the next best CFP semifinalist, Ole Miss (58.7%).And yes, their first-round opener against James Madison was an outlier: while they allowed 323 yards and two touchdowns, it came on 49 pass attempts and quarterback Alonza Barnett III completed just 49% of his throws. Against high-powered Texas Tech, Oregon's secondary dominated, allowing only 137 yards on 32 attempts (4.3 yards per pass) and forcing two interceptions from Brandon Finney Jr. in the shutout.That same ability to generate turnovers and disrupt timing will be critical against Indiana's Heisman-winning quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who Oregon got to at times in the first meeting, including a pick-6 that easily could have led to a win for the Ducks.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The women's college basketball season is ramping up, and while many ranked teams have already suffered upsets early in 2026,  the top four teams -- UConn, Texas, South Carolina and UCLA -- are holding strong and proving to be true championship contenders. But that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement, as even undefeated UConn and Texas have been close to their first losses. Geno Auriemma said the No. 1 Huskies \"can get a lot better,\" and that is a sentiment Vic Schaefer, Dawn Staley and Cori Close have echoed.Conference play won't be forgiving, particularly in the SEC and Big Ten, so the next two months will tell us a lot about who could take over in March. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, here are the main questions for each of the top contenders.Can UConn stay undefeated?We have been asking this question since the preseason, but it is certainly a topic worth revisiting because it is not an easy feat to accomplish. In the history of Division I women's basketball, only 10 national champions have lifted the trophy without a single loss -- and UConn has six of those perfect seasons.\nThe Sarah Strong and Azzi Fudd duo is one of the best in the nation, but the team has depth, too. Freshman Blanca Quiñonez has emerged as another double-figure scorer for the Huskies. Jana El Alfy has found momentum after the holiday break, and Wisconsin transfer Serah Williams has been good enough to be in the starting lineup while still waiting for her true breakout game as a Husky.KK Arnold has done a great job taking over as the starting point guard, but when she missed the game against Providence on New Year's Eve with a nose injury, the team still won by 37 points. While the Friars are not a ranked opponent, and UConn's uncharacteristic 21 turnovers certainly proved Arnold was missed, it was still impressive to get such a dominant victory without their quarterback. Of course, the Huskies are not actually untouchable -- they almost got upset by then-No. 6 Michigan in November. But there is not currently a team in the Big East that looks like a real threat for UConn and the only ranked opponent they have remaining in the regular season will be Tennessee on Feb. 1.\nCan the Texas offense stay strong against SEC opponents?Nobody is questioning Texas's defensive prowess, and it's also undeniable that their offense is significantly stronger than last season. In fact, the Longhorns have one of the top scoring offenses in the nation, averaging 93.2 points per game on 52.1% shooting. They have also reached 100+ points in six games and currently have has six active players averaging at least nine points per contest -- led by POY candidate Madison Booker's 19.1 points per game. Schaefer considers Rori Harmon \"the best point guard in the nation,\" and Texas has been benefiting from Jordan Lee's breakout season.All that being said, Schaefer describes the SEC as \"pure hell,\" so he is well aware that his team can't get too comfortable in the coming months. Texas already defeated South Carolina once this season, but that 66-64 win at the Players Era Championship was a tough battle the Longhorns survived thanks to a last-second shot by Rori Harmon. It was a quality win for sure, but that was Texas's lowest-scoring game this season. Their second-lowest scoring game was a 67-64 win over No. 15 Ole Miss, another SEC foe, on Jan. 4. \"Toughness comes in all forms. It's physical, it's mental,\" Schaefer said. \".... It's a win in the SEC. It's a ranked team again, but I think there's a lot of learning we can get from it.\"\nIn the coming weeks, Texas will need to prove that their offensive improvements were not just an early-season mirage.\nCan South Carolina clean up the little things?South Carolina is a tough team for anyone to face, but being consistent and taking care of the little things can make the difference between a win and a loss in March. The Gamecocks are shooting under 70% from the free-throw line, and those extra points could come in handy in close games such as the ones against Texas or Louisville.Although they recently got a 74-63 win over Florida, it was hardly a smooth ride for Staley's team. The Gators were able to speed them up, which led to the Gamecocks shooting just 34.3% from the field and registering a season-high 21 turnovers. However, they did show fight in what Staley described as an \"ugly\" win and got a season-best 59 rebounds. It's also important to note they were playing without Ta'Niya Latson, who is day-to-day with an ankle injury.\n\"Sometimes you gotta grind it out and win a game no matter how it looks,\" Staley said.Starters have to be specially locked in because although the South Carolina bench averaged 40.3 points per game last season, that production has dipped significantly to 17.4 bench points per contest.\nCan UCLA stay consistent and aggressive?The Bruins opened the season with a 77-53 win against San Diego State, but Close called out her team for a performance that was \"flat all the way around.\" The Bruins played with more urgency after that one, but they still have some alarming lapses. UCLA's only loss this season was against Texas in a game in which the Bruins had seven turnovers and just 10 points in the first quarter. They had a players-only meeting shortly after, which helped them bounce back with a 30-point win against Duke. \nThe Bruins are fresh off an 80-46 victory against crosstown rival USC, but even that game had a shaky start with six turnovers in the first 10 minutes. After the game, Close referenced their December win over Ohio State and pointed out the Bruins gave up 21 points in that one due to mistakes, lack of effort or lack of focus. She has been challenging her team to play with more urgency and awareness.\"There is a difference between hard work and competing. There's an awareness. There is a dog in you,\" Close said. \"There is a sense of urgency that has to happen. I want them to transfer hard work into competitive awareness and competitive fight. I think we are going in the right direction but I think that's still a journey that we need to go on. I think we gotta fight for a few more possessions.\"\n            ",

This year's postseason won't have Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs or Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, but there will still be plenty of familiar faces. The Eagles are in the playoffs for the fifth straight season and they'll be looking to become the first NFC team in 31 years to repeat as Super Bowl champion. Jalen Hurts is one of just two quarterbacks in the playoffs this year who has won a Super Bowl along with Matthew Stafford and Aaron Rodgers. The Steelers quarterback actually has more career playoff wins than every other QB in the AFC playoff field combined. There are also plenty of new faces in the postseason this year, including six teams that didn't make the playoffs last year with the Seahawks, 49ers, Panthers, Bears, Patriots and Jaguars all getting in. The final five teams in that group all lost at least 11 games last year before rebounding to make the postseason this year. The Panthers are in playoffs for the first time since 2017 and they'll be kicking off the postseason this year by hosting the Saturday afternoon game. With that in mind, let's get to the full playoff schedule. \n        \n            \n                Renner's 2026 NFL mock draft 6.0: Raiders, Jets land QBs with top two picks as other teams miss out\n                \n                    Mike Renner                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWild Card WeekendSaturday, Jan. 10(5) Rams at (4) Panthers, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Packers at (2) Bears, 8 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime)Sunday, Jan. 11(6) Bills at (3) Jaguars, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) (Stream on Paramount+)(6) 49ers at (3) Eagles, 4:30 p.m. ET (Fox) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)(7) Chargers at (2) Patriots, 8 p.m. ET (NBC)Monday, Jan. 12(5) Texans at (4) Steelers, 8 p.m. ET (ESPN/ABC) (Stream: Fubo -- try for free)Divisional RoundSaturday, Jan. 17AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 4:30 p.m. ET AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 8 p.m. ETSunday, Jan. 18AFC or NFC divisional matchup, 3 p.m. ETAFC or NFC divisional matchup, 6:30 p.m. ETNote: The winner of the Monday night game in the wild card round will play on Sunday in the divisional round.

    "body": "\n        The Red River Rivalry will carry an extra ounce of intrigue in 2026 after former Texas wide receiver Parker Livingstone announced his commitment to Oklahoma through the transfer portal on Tuesday. Livingstone, a roommate of Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning, should be a key piece of the Sooners' aerial attack next season.Livingstone -- a four-star prospect and the No. 16 wide receiver in the transfer portal, per 247Sports -- insinuated when he entered the portal on Jan. 3 that it was not solely his decision to leave Texas. Just three days later, he found a landing spot within the SEC.\"Never in a million years did I think I would be going into the portal looking for a new home,\" Livingstone said. \"Some things are out of my control. Such is the reality of the ever-changing landscape of college football. Emptied my tank every day for this great university, my teammates & all of the good folks of Texas. Grateful.\"Manning and Livingstone connected 29 times for 516 yards and six touchdowns during the 2025 campaign as both climbed into the starting lineup for the first time. Livingstone, who did not record a catch in his true freshman season, redshirted in 2024 and brings three years of eligibility to Oklahoma. Barring a shakeup in the Sooners' quarterback group, he will catch his passes next year from incumbent starter John Mateer.\nLivingstone was the fourth-leading receiver at Texas during his lone year in the lineup, and he would have ranked fourth in catches and yardage for the Sooners if his 2025 production came at Oklahoma. He could immediately be the top target for the Sooners if Isaiah Sategna III declares for the NFL Draft. Deion Burks exhausted his eligibility, opening the door for Livingstone to at least replace one of the team's two standout receivers.Oklahoma saw Livingstone up close and personal in October when it lost, 23-6, to Texas. The receiver hauled in two catches for 29 yards.Jumping to the other side of the rivalry means Livingstone will shift allegiances in a series with which he was highly familiar as a longtime Texan. The Lucas (Texas) Lovejoy product said earlier this year that he attended a Red River Rivalry game before his commitment to the Longhorns.\n\"You come here, you come to the game, you hear about the game, you're from Dallas,\" Livingstone said in October. \"It's everywhere for a month before the game even happens. I really think it helps out tremendously in recruiting. It's a great reason. My senior year, I came here for the game, and it was an unbelievable atmosphere. I was like, 'I want to play in the burnt orange. I want to be on the right side.'\"\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe two preseason favorites in the ACC collide on Tuesday when the No. 6 Duke Blue Devils square off against the No. 20 Louisville Cardinals at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville.In the fall, Duke was voted the preseason favorite to win the ACC. Louisville finished second in the voting.So far this season, the Blue Devils (13-1, 2-0 in ACC) have stumbled only once, a one-point loss to Texas Tech in New York City last month. Meanwhile, the Cardinals (11-3, 1-1) have lost two of their last four games while playing without star freshman point guard and future pro Mikel Brown Jr. (lower back injury). Brown already has been ruled out of Tuesday's game against Duke.Tonight's game is a rematch of last season's ACC Tournament championship game, which the Blue Devils won 73-62. Duke has dominated the series recently, winning seven in a row, including three straight at the Yum! Center. Louisville hasn't beaten the team from Durham since February 2021. The Blue Devils are 1.5-point favorites over the Cardinals on Tuesday.While Duke-Louisville is the marquee attraction on Tuesday, there are other options on a sporting landscape that also includes six NBA games and a full college basketball schedule. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet for Tuesday, Jan. 6. All times Eastern.College basketball best bets, where to watchNo. 6 Duke at No. 20 LouisvilleTime: 7 p.m. | Location: Louisville | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Duke -107\nThe Cardinals own the fourth-best offense in the country (126.7 points per 100 possessions), but that offense has been built on the shoulders of Brown, a projected NBA lottery pick. His absence will make that end of the court more of a struggle. In addition, Louisville isn't built to defend a player like the Blue Devils' Cameron Boozer. The 6-foot-9, 250-pound future lottery pick ranks third in the nation in scoring (23.0 points per game) and 21st in rebounding (9.8). The SportsLine Projection Model says the Blue Devils have a 53% chance to win and assigns a 'C' grade to the Duke money line (-107).No. 14 Texas Tech at No. 7 HoustonTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: FS1 | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Houston -6.5\nJust how loaded is the Big 12 this season? Of the top nine teams in the Top 25, four hail from the Big 12. One of those is the seventh-ranked Houston Cougars (13-1, 1-0 in Big 12), who were this close to winning the national championship last year. On Tuesday, they will host the surging and 14th-ranked Texas Tech Red Raiders (11-3, 1-0), who have won four in a row and are the only team in the country to have beaten Duke this season. Under coach Kelvin Sampson, the Cougars have continued to play stifling defense, ranking eighth in the nation in defensive rating (94.2 points per 100 possessions). They're capable of slowing down JT Toppin, Tech's reigning Big 12 Player of the Year, and a Red Raiders team that will be playing just its second true road game this season. The SportsLine Projection Model says Houston has a 57.0% chance to cover and gives a 'C' grade to Cougars -6.5.TCU at No. 22 KansasTime: 9 p.m. | Location: Lawrence, Kan. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kansas -8.5\nPerhaps the best soap opera on television is \"All My Jayhawks,\" starring Darryn Peterson. If you haven't been watching Peterson, he's a dynamic three-level scorer who's in contention to be the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NBA Draft. He's been in and out of the lineup for Kansas (10-4, 0-1 in Big 12) with injuries that remain not entirely clear. Will he play? If he does play, how long will he play? On Saturday, Peterson was brilliant, scoring 26 points. But he strangely sat out the final 11 minutes of the Jayhawks' 81-75 loss to UCF. Based on Kansas coach Bill Self's comments on Monday, there's no reason to believe that Peterson will miss tonight's game against TCU (11-3, 1-0), but his workload is anyone's guess. The SportsLine Projection Model says the Jayhawks have a 73.0% chance to cover and assigns a 'B' grade to Kansas -8.5.NBA best bets, where to watchHeat at TimberwolvesTime: 8 p.m. | Location: Minneapolis | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 238.5\nAfter ending 2025 losing three of four games, including at ugly 24-point blowout loss at Atlanta, the Timberwolves have kicked off 2026 with wins over the Heat and Wizards. On Tuesday, Minnesota (23-13) gets its second shot in four days at Miami (20-16) when the teams battle at the Target Center. Three days ago, the Timberwolves got 33 points from Anthony Edwards and 20 second-half points from Naz Reid for a 125-115 victory over the Heat. Tuesday's game features two of the top seven defensive teams in the NBA -- Miami ranks fourth (111.9), while Minnesota is seventh (112.7). The SportsLine Projection Model says there's a 55.9% chance the teams combine for 238 points or fewer and gives a 'B' grade to Under 238.5. Mavericks at KingsTime: 11 p.m. | Location: Sacramento, Calif. | TV: NBC/Peacock | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Kings +5.5\nTwo teams looking to turn their season around will battle when the Sacramento Kings (8-28) host the Dallas Mavericks (13-23) at the Golden 1 Center. The Mavericks have lost six of their last eight games but are coming off a victory over Houston, though the Rockets played most of that game without Alperen Sengun. Meanwhile, the Kings have lost five in a row and 11 of 13. But one of those wins was a 113-107 decision over Dallas on Dec. 27. No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg has misfired over the last three games for the Mavericks, averaging just 12.3 points while shooting just 29.8% from the field. The SportsLine Projection Model says Sacramento has a 53.0% chance to cover and assigns a 'C' grade to Kings +5.5.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kliff Kingsbury has been many things as a coordinator and coach -- Case Keenum's college offensive coordinator, Johnny Manziel's college offensive coordinator, Patrick Mahomes' college coach, Kyler Murray's NFL coach and Jayden Daniels' NFL offensive coordinator -- but he's also always been one thing: himself.The up-tempo, shotgun-centric \"Air Raid\" (with adjustments) offense has been his thing. Good, bad, in the middle, regardless of location or role. He's always been a tireless worker: Back in 2022, \"Hard Knocks\" captured him waking up just after 3 a.m. and arriving at the Arizona Cardinals' practice facility before 4 a.m., citing his playing career not reaching the heights he wanted as a motivating factor. With the Washington Commanders, he and Daniels were consistently among the first people at the facility.\"I'm pretty consistent with the coaching style,\" Kingsbury said early in 2025 training camp, when he was coming off the Commanders' breakthrough.\n        \n            \n                NFL Power Rankings: Big miss on Seahawks and preseason top 10 as Chiefs, Lions miss postseason\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAnd near the end of the year, Washington's disappointing 5-12 season that proved his ouster?\n\"Yeah, I've seen [the no-huddle offense] done at a high level you know, whether it's Arizona or here at a very high level and won games and had a lot of yards, a lot of success in that regard. So, I think I'm pretty confident, you know, in that style of play when the pieces are there that you can play a really high level, and it's a very challenging offensive stop.\"Kingsbury, 46, didn't have the pieces this year; that much is certain. Daniels played in just seven games, and he left three of those seven early. All parties involved wished Terry McLaurin's extension had been done earlier so he could have had more time to grow with Daniels in training camp and get into football shape: McLaurin suffered a quad injury in Week 3 and played in a career-low 10 games. The team's other top outside wide receiver, Noah Brown, appeared in just four games. The offensive line wasn't whole until mid-October.And yet the Commanders still finished 12th in offensive success rate and won games with not only Daniels but Marcus Mariota and Josh Johnson. Players spoke glowingly of Kingsbury, with Daniels saying \"I love working with Kliff,\" and \"Me and him have a special relationship. Mariota praised Kingsbury's system for making things easy on the quarterback. McLaurin talked about the way he, his role and his alignments grew under Kingsbury and also complimented Kingsbury for being \"open to communication.\"\nBut coach Dan Quinn wanted a more traditional run-heavy, clock management-driven, approach, ESPN's John Keim reported, even though that goes against what Kingsbury has always been. The Commanders had the fifth-highest rushing rate in the NFL over Kingsbury's two seasons as offensive coordinator, but they also had the most quarterback rushes in the NFL (24th-most running back runs). Kingsbury's system was tremendous for Daniels in Year 1. It was less successful in Year 2 for several reasons, some out of Kingsbury's control.\"There's a ton of different decisions I wish we would've made and I would've made, and more just like individual play calls than anything, you know, our style of play was a bit different,\" Kingsbury said. \"Like I said, trying to slow the games down, limit possessions, do things of that nature. But yeah, there are a ton of things I wish I would've done better as far as scheme and maximizing players and things of that nature.\"Kingsbury couldn't control injuries. He couldn't control the defense being one of the NFL's worst.\n\"We had a bunch of guys that were kind of in and out of the lineup, and it's a credit to this staff of getting these guys prepared,\" Mariota said.It's not a \"wrong\" call from Quinn, per se, but it's certainly a big one. Sometimes circumstances change. Sometimes strategies change. The Commanders will have big changes ahead, and Quinn had better be right.Kingsbury, meanwhile, will likely be in the running for both head coach and offensive coordinator gigs. Call his offense what you will, but it is not \"gimmicky\" in any sense of the word. Kingsbury showed flexibility and creativity as a play caller and play designer. The Commanders had a well-versed, multi-faceted rushing attack and a screen game that worked wonders at its peak. Kingsbury helped produce not only a career year McLaurin but a renaissance from Zach Ertz in his mid-30s and a bounce-back from Deebo Samuel in his late-20s. He often made do with castoffs and youngsters, elevating the games of players such as Noah Brown, Dyami Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus.\nHere's where Kingsbury could end up next.1. New York Giants offensive coordinatorKingsbury has previously expressed a desire to return to head coaching, and he decided to remain in Washington last year, when he could have been one of the top candidates for an opening. How much a tough 2025 hurt his coaching candidacy remains to be determined, but his best fit could be to remain an offensive coordinator.He'll want a mobile quarterback, versatile running game and some weapons to maximize that attack, and the Giants stand out as the team that fits the bill best. Jaxson Dart showed impressive rushing ability, and the Giants have a tandem of capable backs in bruiser Cam Skattebo as well as the speedier Tyrone Tracy Jr., who has quietly reached 1,000+ yards from scrimmage in each of his two seasons. Malik Nabers looked like a star in the making before an early-season knee injury, and Wan'Dale Robinson could be a versatile, movable chess piece as well. Tracy and Robinson in particular could help fuel Kingsbury's versatility as a play caller and designer.2. Tennessee Titans offensive coordinatorCam Ward quietly finished his rookie season strongly, throwing for eight touchdowns and just one interception over his last four full games (he left the season finale with a shoulder injury but won't need surgery). He's doesn't run like Murray, Daniels or Dart, but he's not a statue, either. He showed impressive escapability down the stretch of his debut season, and his sack numbers declined in kind.\nWard has said he wants to be involved in the coach-hiring process, and if the candidate at hand isn't Kingsbury, he would do well to pitch Kingsbury as the offensive coordinator. The Titans have a long way to go int he rebuild process, but Kingsbury has developed young quarterbacks everywhere he's been. Tennessee has some gifted if inconsistent wide receivers, too, in Himere Dike and Elic Ayomanor.3. Giants coachThe Giants would do well to strongly consider Kingsbury for the main gig, not just a coordinator one. Kingsbury has undoubtedly learned from his time as the Cardinals' coach, which included him building a team from 3-13 the year before he arrived to 5-10, then 8-8, then 11-6. People often recall his final season -- 4-13 -- and his struggles down the second half of seasons most, but they forget how good of a job he did, with two-10th overall total offenses. He did it all with Kyler Murray a quarterback who not only had limitations but played his best ball under Kingsbury and now appears on his way out of Arizona.Hiring Kingsbury would be a big bet. He would have to get the call at defensive coordinator right. The Giants really struggled on that side in 2025 but have foundational pieces along the line. It's a big market that comes with a ton of scrutiny. If Kingsbury is up for it, though, he and Dart could form a strong partnership.\n4. Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinatorCould Kingsbury's home be just a short drive north? The Ravens sent shockwaves through the NFL by firing John Harbaugh on Tuesday, ending an 18-year partnership with one of the NFL's most stable franchises.Kingsbury and Lamar Jackson could be a fit for all the reasons listed about other quarterbacks: mobility, operation out of the shotgun, etc. The Ravens do have Derrick Henry, so Kingsbury might have to adjust to be more running back-centric, but he has been willing to adjust before. Zay Flowers seems like a strong fit for Kingsbury's quick-hitting passing schemes, too.It's not a perfect fit. Jackson isn't a young quarterback like basically all the others Kingsbury has worked with. Running up-tempo seems at first glance incongruous for a team that might be better suited to grind some games out in the grimy, tough AFC North. But the Ravens need change badly. They didn't fire Harbaugh to keep the status quo. Kingsbury would have to interview well and show a clear plan for melding his style to Baltimore's personnel. Just don't count it out completely.\n5. Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinatorThe Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris, and while that doesn't preclude offensive coordinator Zac Robinson from coming back, there's a reasonable chance whomever succeeds Morris will want to handpick his offensive coordinator. If that coach is a first-timer, having the experience of Kingsbury would be helpful; if it isn't a first-timer, Kingsbury could still fit the bill.Atlanta has a strong offensive line, a superstar versatile running back in Bijan Robinson and a star wide receiver in Drake London. Quarterback is a big question, but Michael Penix Jr. has operated out of the shotgun his entire career, so there's at least some synergy there. Penix isn't a dual-threat guy, but Kingsbury has shown abilities to adapt. And if Penix turns out not to be the answer, Kingsbury could again be a mentor for another young quarterback.NOTE: We didn't consider sending Kingsbury back to the Cardinals, nor did we consider him for any Las Vegas Raiders openings. Kingsbury withdrew from the Raiders' offensive coordinator search at the last minute two years ago.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The most surprising result of the 2025-26 NBA season happened Monday night when the perpetually rebuilding Charlotte Hornets waltzed into the Paycom Center in Oklahoma City and demolished the reigning champion Thunder, 124-97. After a 24-1 start that had them on pace to challenge the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors for the single-season wins record (73), the Thunder are now 6-6 in their last 12 games. This is the worst stretch of regular season basketball the Thunder have played -- at least by record -- since 2022-23, which was the last time they failed to reach the playoffs. At a time like this, it's worth recalling a quote from Thunder general manager Sam Presti, who said the following in April of 2023 at his exit interview:\"The sky falls on every NBA team at least two times a year. Over 82 games, you will not play well for 82 games. You may play horrible for weeks, it may be a month. You don't want to have several months, but every team, the teams that are still playing right now, the sky fell on [them] this season, and everybody freaked out.\"The 30-7 Thunder still have a four-game lead over the San Antonio Spurs atop the Western Conference and a 2½-game advantage on the Detroit Pistons for the best record in the league, and remain the clear favorite to win the title (+115, per Caesars). But right now, the sky is falling in Oklahoma City, and everyone is freaking out. Let's take a deep dive into what's gone wrong for the Thunder and examine some of the weaknesses they've shown that could hurt their repeat quest. \n1. Not getting the callsFree throws tend to always the most divisive topic with the Thunder, so let's start there. There have long been complaints -- not only from fans, but opposing coaches and players -- about how the Thunder are allowed to play defense compared to how teams are allowed to defend the Thunder, specifically Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. \"It's so frustrating to play this team because they foul a ton. You know, they really do, they foul, they foul, all the time,\" Minnesota Timberwolves coach Chris Finch -- perhaps the most vocal critic -- said last February. \"And then, you know, you can't really touch Shai. And it's a very frustrating thing, and it takes a lot of mental toughness to try to play through it.\"\nMore recently, Finch lost his mind and was ejected minutes into his team's eventual win over the Thunder on Dec. 19 after the refs appeared to miss multiple calls in quick succession. Finch had to be held back multiple times and was eventually fined $35,000 for his reaction. \nHave officials have been influenced by Finch's outburst and all the subsequent chatter? Perhaps. There's no doubt that the Thunder have not been getting the same calls they were getting earlier in the season. The numbers make that absolutely clear. Here's a look at the Thunder's free throw numbers as a team (league ranks in parenthesis): \nPeriodFTMFTAFT%FTA RateFirst 25 games20.6 (11th)24.7 (16th)83.2% (2nd).279 (15th)Last 12 games17.9 (18th)21.5 (23rd)83.3% (2nd).234 (24th)The Thunder are scoring nearly three fewer points at the line per game during this skid. Notably, Gilgeous-Alexander -- the only player on the Thunder averaging more than 3.8 free throws per game for the season -- accounts for almost the entire drop-off. Here's a look at Gilgeous-Alexander's free throw numbers (league ranks in parenthesis):PeriodFTMFTAFT%Double-digit FTA GamesFirst 25 games8.8 (2nd)9.9 (3rd)88.2%13Last 12 games6.3 (13th)6.8 (18th)91.5%0It's worth noting that Gilgeous-Alexander's drives per game have actually increased during the Thunder's skid. He was averaging 17.5 in their first 25 games (fourth in the league), and is averaging 18.8 in their last 12 games (third in the league). And yet, his free throw attempts are down significantly. If this trend continues and it's significantly easier for opponents to keep Gilgeous-Alexander off the line, that will be a major blow to the Thunder's offense. 2. Inconsistent supporting castFor the season, Gilgeous-Alexander has scored (1,191) or assisted (591) on 1,782 of the Thunder's 4,486 points (39.7%). He leads the team in scoring (31.6 points), assists (6.4) and minutes (33.1) per game by a wide margin. Despite widely being praised for their depth, the Thunder's supporting cast is inconsistent on offense and they remain heavily reliant on Gilgeous-Alexander on that side of the ball. In 1,191 minutes with SGA on the floor, the Thunder have a 122.1 offensive rating; in 605 minutes without him, the Thunder have a 108.8 offensive rating. The Thunder don't have another 20-point-per-game scorer this season, and the supporting cast lacks on-ball creators aside from Jalen Williams (who hasn't looked like his usual self since his return from offseason wrist surgery). Unless Gilgeous-Alexander is doing it for them, it's hard for the Thunder to create advantages in the halfcourt. The good news for the Thunder is that Gilgeous-Alexander has been historically reliable in recent years. He hasn't scored fewer than 20 points since Oct. 30, 2024 -- 108 games ago, the second-longest such streak of all-time -- and has failed to reach the 20-point mark just 10 times since the beginning of the 2022-23 season, when he made his first All-NBA First Team. Since the Thunder became contenders in 2023-24, Gilgeous-Alexander has scored at least 30 points in 126 of the 187 games he's played in -- the Thunder are 104-22 when he gets to 30 points -- and has sat out just 14 times. The vast majority of the time, Gilgeous-Alexander shows up and puts the Thunder on his back. When he doesn't, the Thunder tend to struggle, as we've seen recently. Gilgeous-Alexander had just 21 points on 7-of-21 shooting in their loss to the Hornets on Monday, which was his worst offensive outing of the season. In fact, his three worst showings of the season have all come in the last two weeks:Dec. 25, loss to Spurs: 22 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists on 7 of 19 FG (1 of 6 3FG)Jan. 5, loss to Suns: 25 points, 0 rebounds, 6 assists on 8 of 22 FG (1 of 5 3FG)Jan. 6, loss to Hornets: 21 points, 2 rebounds, 6 assists on 7 of 21 FG (1 of 5 3FG)While Gilgeous-Alexander is still putting up 29.5 points on 52.2% shooting overall in the last 12 games, he hasn't gotten the help when he's needed it. Aside from Lu Dort and Alex Caruso, every rotation player is averaging fewer points over the last 12 games than they were during the team's 24-1 start. Here's a look at the supporting cast's scoring numbers:PlayerPPG in first 25 gamesPPG in last 12 gamesChet Holmgren18.816.6Jalen Williams17.317.1Ajay Mitchell14.213Aaron Wiggins13.26.3Isaiah Joe12.95.7Isaiah Hartenstein12.27.4Cason Wallace8.55.8Lu Dort8.38.3Kenrich Williams64..8Alex Caruso5.56.8Minutes, roles and injuries have played a part, of course, in some of those changes, but the chart above paints a clear picture. Notably, Williams and Holmgren went from a combined 36.1 points per game to 33.7, and the team went from having six double-digit scorers aside from Gilgeous-Alexander to three. \nIt's fair to wonder if carrying such a heavy offensive burden while playing almost every single night is starting to wear on Gilgeous-Alexander, even just slightly. And as this recent stretch has shown, the Thunder aren't a dominant force if Gilgeous-Alexander isn't consistently awesome. Perhaps now is the time for Presti to cash in some of the assets he's hoarded over the years and make a trade to boost the Thunder's offense. In the meantime, giving Mitchell a bigger role on offense, like he had earlier in the season when Williams was sidelined, could help some of their creation issues. Aside from Williams, he's the one member of the supporting cast who can reliably create anything for himself. For the season, 57.2% of Mitchell's field goals have been unassisted (Gilgeous-Alexander is at 79.7% and Williams is at 62.5%). No one else in the rotation is above 30.6%. 3. Streaky 3-point shootingThe Thunder have not been a high-volume 3-point team throughout their rise, and have lacked truly elite shooters aside from Isaiah Joe -- and he's often been on the fringes of the rotation. In general, they've surrounded Gilgeous-Alexander with capable outside threats who are prone to ice-cold stretches. When the Thunder were stunned by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round of the 2024 playoffs, they lost in large part because they shot 33.5% from 3-point range in that series. Even en route to the title last season, there were stretches in the playoffs where they could not buy a shot from behind the arc. They were so much better than the Memphis Grizzlies that it didn't matter that they shot 31.3% from 3-point range in that series, but they needed seven games to avoid a major upset in the second round against the Denver Nuggets when they only made 32.3% of their 3s. This current 12-game skid has been yet another example of the Thunder's streaky outside shooting. Here's a look at the Thunder's 3-point shooting as a team (league ranks in parenthesis):Period3PM3PA3P%First 25 games14.2 (8th)37.2 (16th)38.1% (5th)Last 12 games12.2 (23rd)36.9 (18th)33% (24th)Gilgeous-Alexander's 3-point shooting has fallen off a cliff, which is a real issue when he's third on the team in attempts per game (4.9 for the season). However, there are issues across the board. Kenrich Williams, Wiggins, Wallace and Caruso are all shooting at least 8% worse than they were earlier in the season. And while Dort has been slightly better as of late, he has not been able to replicate what he did last season, when he made a career-high 41.2% of his attempts. Player3P% First 25 games3P% Last 12 gamesKenrich Williams46.7%36.8%Shai Gilgeous-Alexander45.4%32.2%Aaron Wiggins43.8%29%Isaiah Joe41.9%38.6%Chet Holmgren39.5%36.8%Cason Wallace38.1%30.2%Alex Caruso36%22.9%Ajay Mitchell34.6%40%Lu Dort32.5%34.6%Jalen Williams28.6%32.4%The good news for the Thunder is that they are creating plenty of open shots. Over the last 12 games, they are third in wide-open (nearest opponent six-plus feet away) 3s per game (24), but are 28th in wide-open 3-point percentage (34.4%). As long as they keep generating open shots, the percentages will swing back around. However, there has been an abundance of evidence over recent years that the Thunder will continue to have wild swings in shot-making if they do not acquire better shooters. Will Presti make a move at the deadline to try and boost their spacing? 4. Tougher scheduleThe Thunder's schedule has been another key factor in their slide. During their 24-1 start, they played just five games against teams that currently have a record above .500. During their 6-6 stretch, they've played six games against teams that currently have a record above .500 -- four of which have been losses. For the season, the Thunder are 24-2 against teams currently below .500 and 6-5 against teams currently above .500. Notably, three of those losses have come to the Spurs, the No. 2 team in the West. It's also worth noting that they've played 11 games in 19 days since play resumed after the NBA Cup, and their loss to the Hornets was the second night of a back-to-back and their third game in four days after a West Coast road trip. \nOn that front, the Thunder have the toughest remaining schedule in the league by a a good margin, with an average opponent winning percentage of .545. The Thunder remain deserved favorites for the title, and will still likely finish with the best record in the league. However, their march to a repeat no longer seems the foregone conclusion it did this time a month ago. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Miami and Ole Miss are chasing history in the College Football Playoff. Ole Miss has already broken the school record with 13 wins, and is closer than ever before to winning the school's first solo national title. Miami has bucked expectations, sneaking into the playoff and navigating the most difficult postseason path to reach the semifinals.It's the ACC vs. SEC, a high-flying offense against a big-time defense. It's The U against The New. No matter who wins, the victor will land in the national championship as an unlikely participant. Simply put, No. 10 Miami vs. No. 6 Ole Miss doesn't get much better in terms of stakes and storylines. The Rebels could win a national title without Lane Kiffin, who bolted town for rival LSU -- and grabbed a few Ole Miss assistants -- before the playoff. Miami can cap its long-gestating return to glory under alum Mario Cristobal, who left Oregon three years ago to lift his alma mater back on the national stage.Neither team is short on superstars. Quarterback Carson Beck is the most accurate passer remaining in the playoffs. Ole Miss' Trinidad Chambliss went from a Division II national champion to a backup on the Rebels' bench to perhaps the most electric player in the postseason. Georgia couldn't keep up with him in the quarterfinals as he led the Rebels to a thrilling, 39-34 comeback victory. \nMiami's defense has been a brick wall, allowing only 17 total points in wins against Texas A&M and Ohio State in the CFP. They sacked mobile quarterback Marcel Reed seven times on the road. Julian Sayin, the nation's most accurate passer, couldn't pick up first downs.The Fiesta Bowl pits two of the most fascinating stories in the CFP.Miami vs. Ole Miss: Need to know for Fiesta BowlTrench warfare: Miami's postseason run has been highlighted by the incredible pass rush provided by Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, who have helped lead the nation's best sack-producing defense. The Hurricanes have 12 sacks in two playoff games and have recorded at least four sacks in four straight games, pushing their total to 46 for the season. Their pressure rate is also an elite 40.5%. Ole Miss only allows 1.3 sacks per game, ranking in the top 20 nationally, and actually ranks behind Ohio State, which gave up six sacks to Miami. Still, the difference for the Rebels is quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, whose mobility kept Georgia out of reach. The Bulldogs had zero sacks and only three tackles for loss in the quarterfinals. Ole Miss is sacked on only 3.1% of pass plays, ranking seventh nationally. Championship pedigrees: Ole Miss has never won a solo national title, and Miami is chasing its first since 2001, but championship-worthy quarterbacks lead both teams in their pursuit of history. Chambliss led Ferris State to a Division II national title last season before transferring to Ole Miss. Carson Beck is 36-5 in his career, including a 15-3 record against ranked opponents. He's the first quarterback to win that many games over three years since 2012-14 (Marcus Mariota). Beck has completed 74.4% of his passes, but in the last two games, he's thrown for fewer than 150 yards for the first time in his career as a starter. Chambliss has thrown for 300-plus yards in eight games this season, including a career high in the win last week against Georgia.\nWhich elite running back steps up?: Get ready for a run-off in Arizona. Miami's Mark Fletcher Jr. has been a bull in the playoffs, especially late in games, rushing for 262 yards in the postseason to rank fourth all-time in CFP history. Ole Miss' Kewan Lacy is a scoring machine, recording rushing touchdowns in the last eight games while picking up an incredible 877 yards over that span. Lacy's 23 rushing touchdowns rank third in SEC history, behind two Alabama running backs who won national titles in their respective seasons.Where to watch Miami vs. Ole Miss liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 8 | Time: 7:30 p.m. ETLocation: State Farm Stadium -- Glendale, ArizonaTV: ESPN | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)Miami vs. Ole Miss prediction, picks\nIf Miami struggles to affect Trinidad Chambliss in the pocket, the Rebels win. If the Rebels can't protect their quarterback against defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor, the Hurricanes win. Chambliss has escaped pressure most of the season, but so had Texas A&M's Marcel Reed before Miami sacked him seven times in the first round. Ole Miss' defense is solid but not elite, which should allow the Hurricanes to score at least three touchdowns with a multitude of stars who have been kept at bay against two elite defenses in the CFP. Ole Miss has scored 30-plus in eight straight games.  Pick: Over 51.5\n\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n

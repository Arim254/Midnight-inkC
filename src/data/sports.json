    "body": "\n        The 14th-ranked Missouri Tigers will get their first true test of the 2025 college football season when they host the No. 8 Alabama Crimson Tide on Saturday. Mizzou (5-0, 1-0 SEC) has yet to face a ranked team and has played just two Power Conference opponents, as the Tigers defeated UMass, 42-6, in their previous game before a bye last week. Meanwhile, Alabama (4-1, 2-0) has looked like a typical Tide team since losing its opener to Florida State. The Tide are coming off back-to-back wins over ranked SEC teams in Vanderbilt and Georgia. Alabama lists star receiver Ryan Williams as probable.Kickoff is at noon ET from Memorial Stadium in Columbia, Mo. The Crimson Tide are 3.5-point favorites in the latest Missouri vs. Alabama odds, after opening as 6.5-point favorites. The over/under for total points scored is 52.5 via SportsLine consensus. Before making any Alabama vs. Missouri picks, check out the college football predictions from the SportsLine Projection Model. New users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $200 in bonus bets instantly if your initial $5 wager wins.The model simulates every FBS game 10,000 times.

The Tide are 5-1 against the spread against ranked teams since the start of last season, which includes a 34-0 drubbing of then-No. 21 Missouri last season. That result was simply par for the course for Alabama in recent meetings with Missouri as the Crimson Tide have won six straight matchups, all by at least 18 points.Quarterback Ty Simpson is now one of the Heisman favorites and deservedly so. He has twice as many rushing touchdowns (two) as interceptions (one), to go along with 11 passing scores and a 70.3% completion rate. Alabama's passing game is only matched by its pass defense, as the Tide have kept all five opponents under 200 passing yards and have given up just three touchdowns thru the air all year. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why Missouri can coverGetting points at home won't faze Missouri as the team is 9-3 against the spread as a home underdog under head coach Eli Drinkwitz. Mizzou also has the rest advantage after not playing last week, and the Tigers have covered in four of their last five games following a bye. Meanwhile, the Tide haven't exactly lived up to the billing when favored on the road as they've covered in just two of their last six games as an away favorite.Missouri has won eight straight games dating back to last season, and the offense has been the catalyst for its perfect record this year. After leading the Sun Belt in both rushing yards and touchdowns last year, Ahmad Hardy leads all of FBS with 730 rushing yards this season. The Tigers lead the conference in completion percentage, rank third in yards per rush and are fundamentally sound, averaging the second-fewest penalties and the third-fewest turnovers per game. See which team to back at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets instantly at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to make Alabama vs. Missouri picksSportsLine's model has simulated Missouri vs. Alabama 10,000 times and is going Over on the total, projecting 53 combined points.

    "body": "\n        The San Francisco 49ers' 3-0 run with backup quarterback Mac Jones has fueled predictable chatter: could a quarterback controversy be brewing once starter Brock Purdy returns from injury? General manager John Lynch doesn't see it that way -- and insists neither does Purdy. Lynch went out of his way to quiet speculation about any tension between the two quarterbacks, praising Purdy's temperament and perspective during his recovery from a toe injury, in an appearance with KNBR this week\"I do wholeheartedly believe that Brock is nothing but happy for our team,\" Lynch said. \"He's working his tail off to try to get back, and I think we all feel blessed and fortunate we found a backup who can go in and play like a starter.\"Purdy, who started just two of the first five games of the season for the 49ers, has continued rehabbing his injury while Jones leads the offense. Lynch said the young quarterback has remained focused on returning, not on protecting his job.\n\"A cool quality about Brock Purdy is he's one of the most self-assured people in a very humble way,\" Lynch said. \"It's hard to explain but I think it's one of the things that appealed to us. He's just very confident in his abilities, but he's just a good guy. He's got an incredible amount of humility.\"Jones has thrived in the opportunity while guiding the 49ers to wins in each of his starts. The former first-round pick by the New England Patriots -- and one-time draft target of San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan -- has completed 66.7% of his passes for 905 yards, six touchdowns and one interception through three starts. His steady command of the offense has helped San Francisco stay atop the NFC West while Purdy heals.While some outside the organization have framed the situation as a brewing competition, both quarterbacks have handled it with professionalism. Jones himself acknowledged after last week's win over the Rams that Purdy remains the starter once healthy, calling his own role temporary.\n\"They brought me here to play as a backup, and that's my job,\" Jones said. \"Brock's the starter of this team, and right now he's dealing with something. For him to go out there last week and play when you know he probably wasn't at full health, he cares about this team. I'm just trying to get some wins for him so it helps us down the line.\"Lynch echoed that sense of calm, noting that the 49ers' locker room is unfazed by outside debate. He credited Jones for how he's embraced the backup role and evolved within the system since arriving in Santa Clara, saying his confidence had been building throughout the offseason and training camp.Purdy was ruled out for Sunday's Week 6 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, leaving Jones in line for a fourth straight start -- although he was listed as questionable (knee, oblique) on Friday's injury report. But inside team headquarters, Lynch's message was clear: San Francisco doesn't see a controversy — just a deep roster and a healthy situation at quarterback.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        While last week was light on elite matchups, there are some heavyweight contests to consider for 7 college football picks. The headliner is the top-10 contest of Oregon vs. Indiana (CBS/Paramount+), in which the No. 3 Ducks are 7-point favorites over the No. 7 Hoosiers, per the latest Week 7 college football odds. There's also the Red River Rivalry of No. 6 Oklahoma vs. Texas, with Arch Manning's Longhorns listed as 1-point underdogs against an OU team that lists star quarterback John Mateer (hand) as probable.Other Top 25 games include Alabama vs. Missouri (+3.5) in the SEC and Ohio State vs. Illinois (+14.5) in the Big Ten. Meanwhile, the USC Trojans aren't ranked, but many will still look to place Week 7 college football bets on their matchup with Michigan (+2.5), in a game between two of the most prestigious programs in the sport.

Both teams are coming off a bye, but the Hoosiers have recently been in a bit of a malaise after an off week, having covered just one over their last six games after a bye. Under coach Curt Cignetti, IU is 0-2 versus top-five ranked teams, while Oregon has a sterling 8-2-1 spread record over its last 11 versus ranked opponents. Additionally, the Ducks should exploit Indiana's red-zone defense as the Hoosiers have allowed all of their opponent trips into the red zone to end up in points, making Indiana one of eight teams in the nation to allow points on every opponent red-zone visit. SportsLine's model has the Ducks covering nearly 60% of the time. See which other picks the model likes here.\nAnother prediction: No. 11 LSU (-9, 44.5) covers against South Carolina in more than 50% of simulations Saturday at 7:45 p.m. ET. LSU is riding a 20-game home win streak versus unranked foes, while South Carolina is just 2-8 on the road versus SEC ranked opponents under coach Shane Beamer. While LSU has struggled at time on offense this season, its issues don't compare with that of the Gamecocks, who rank fifth-worst in all of FBS with 2.9 yards per carry. Quarterback LaNorris Sellers hasn't lived up to his preseason Heisman hype and has just five total touchdowns on the season, while the Tigers can take solace in the fact that they're 12-1 all-time versus USC at home. The model also forecasts the Over to hit over 60% of the time. See the rest of the model's picks here.\nHow to make college football picks for Week 7The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every FBS matchup in Week 7, and it's calling for five underdogs to win straight-up, including an SEC shocker. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine, and for a limited time you can use promo code CHAMPIONSHIP to get your first month at SportsLine for $1.So what college football picks can you make with confidence, and which five underdogs win outright?

This is the week, and I'm excited to use him in a lot of DFS lineups on DraftKings and FanDuel.His price is excellent on both sites since he's $6,600 on DraftKings and $6,000 on FanDuel. And his matchup against the Cowboys is amazing.Dallas is No. 1 in most Fantasy points allowed to opposing receivers. And in the past four games against the Cowboys, six receivers have scored at least 15.2 PPR points, including one in each week, with 10 touchdowns over that span.I'm expecting that trend to continue in Week 6, and McMillan has at least eight targets in every game this season. McMillan is poised to dominate in this game.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 6, click on this link to SportsLine For more of my DFS plays for Week 6, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\n        Charles Oliveira is coming home. Oliveira fights in his home nation of Brazil for the first time since 2020 on Saturday. Lightweight contender Mateusz Gamrot assumes the antagonist role in their UFC Fight Night headliner.Oliveira (35-11) last fought in Brazil five years ago where he beat Kevin Lee in the final event before the COVID-19 shutdowns. The fight took place in an empty arena, meaning \"Do Bronx\" hasn't fought in front of Brazilian fans for six years. It's bittersweet to think that the entirety of Oliveira's title campaign -- in which he finished Michael Chandler, Dustin Poirier, and Justin Gaethje to become a fan-favorite star -- took place outside of his home nation. Oliveira returns home empty-handed, but he's eager to parlay a win over Gamrot into a ceremonial BMF title fight with Max Holloway, which he in turn hopes gets him another crack at the UFC title.\"It's for my legacy,\" Oliveira told CBS Sports through a Portuguese interpreter when asked why he demanded to fight on this card. \"To be in front of my fans and feel the energy of the Brazilian people.\"Gamrot (25-3) has been waiting for a fight like this. Possibly the division's best wrestler, Gamrot is not deterred by Oliveira's ultra-dangerous Brazilian jiu-jitsu. If anything, he's excited to face a rare opponent who will indulge in grappling. External factors give Gamrot a surge of confidence. Oliveira was originally preparing to fight a very different opponent in Rafael Fiziev, an elite striker, before Gamrot stepped in. Additionally, Gamrot sees Arman Tsarukyan's success against Oliveira as a telling sign ahead of Saturday's fight.\n\n        \n            \n                Alex Pereira suffers broken foot in win over Magomed Ankalaev; opponent entered with rib injury, per report\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"Oliveira doesn't like wrestlers,\" Gamrot told CBS Sports. \"He's the most dangerous guy on the ground. I understand people don't want to go to the ground with him. But not me. Wrestling and BJJ are in my DNA. \"I love exchanging submissions and grappling. I'm happy because my previous opponents always try to stand up. Charles Oliveira will try to submit me or scramble with me.\"Check out the full interview with Mateusz Gamrot below.  \nSaturday's Fight Night has a few worthwhile matchups and plenty of Brazilian representation for the home crowd. Two-time flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo continues his bantamweight campaign against rising contender Montel Jackson. Figueriedo returns after suffering a knee injury loss to Cory Sandhagen, in the fight preceding Sandhagen's title shot against Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 320. Jackson is on a six-fight winning streak in pursuit of his biggest win to date.\nThere's also an all-action clash between welterweights Vicente Luque and Joel Alvarez. Luque has seen better days, but he's one fight shy of potentially tying UFC welterweight records for most finishes and post-fight bonuses. Speaking of finishes, you won't find a more consistent finisher than Alvarez. All 22 of his professional wins are by stoppage, including seven in the UFC. Alvarez is on a three-fight winning streak after being knocked out by top contender Tsarukyan in 2022.Let's take a closer look at the rest of the fight card with the latest odds from DraftKings Sportsbook before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event.

The Polish fighter, representing American Top Team, might have the best pure wrestling in the division. Gamrot averages more than five takedowns per 15 minutes, while Oliveira gives up more than half the attempts on him. Oliveira's razor-sharp submission game takes the pressure off defending takedowns, but Gamrot has the skills to avoid being tapped. Don't forget: Gamrot beat Tsarukyan in a brilliant five-round grappling display. What Oliveira has going for him is a two-pronged threat. He's an incredibly potent offensive striker, and his questionable striking defense won't come back to bite him in this fight. Oliveira can replicate and build on the striking success Dan Hooker had against Gamrot. Admittedly, I am concerned that Oliveira couldn't finish Chandler over 25 minutes last year. My head says Gamrot, but my heart says Oliveira, and few people exemplify heart like \"Do Bronx.\" Oliveira via KO3\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners won an instant classic, and the Detroit Tigers lost a heartbreaker Friday night at T-Mobile Park. The Mariners, thanks to Jorge Polanco's 15th-inning walk-off single, won Game 5 of the ALDS (SEA 3, DET 2) and advanced to the ALCS. They'll take on the Toronto Blue Jays when that series begins Sunday. The Tigers have to make the long flight home. Long before Polanco's walk-off single, Tigers ace and reigning AL Cy Young winner Tarik Skubal was brilliant, striking out 13 Mariners in six innings of one-run ball. The 13 strikeouts are the most ever in a winner-take-all game, and at one point Skubal struck out eight consecutive batters. That is also a postseason record. \"It's incredible.  He kick-started us in such a good direction.  He  missed a ton at-bats,\" Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said about Skubal's performance. \"If you're not a fan of the Tigers and you  haven't watched Tarik start after start after start, you're going to see  why he gets the love he does, because he's incredible.\"Skubal threw 99 pitches, and, given the importance of the game and how well he was pitching, it seemed like he would remain in the game until the tank was on E. Instead, he was removed after 99 pitches, eight fewer than he threw in his 14-strikeout masterpiece against the Cleveland Guardians in the ALDS. Did the Tigers leave some Skubal pitches on the table? \"Easy decision,\" Hinch said about removing Skubal. \"After the fifth, I checked in on him how he was doing  physically and emotionally, and we both knew that he had one left.  You  know, he emptied his tank and obviously was emotional coming off the  mound, and I think that signals exactly where we were in the game.  He  gave us everything he could.\"\nRemoving Skubal backfired immediately. Righty Kyle Finnegan took over in the seventh, allowed a walk and a single, then lefty Tyler Holton surrendered the game-tying single to pinch-hitter Leo Rivas. Rivas pinch-hit for pinch-hitter Dominic Canzone. There was a lot of \"strategy\" that inning. Seattle tied Game 5 as soon as Skubal was out of the game. Skubal's season high is the 107 pitches he threw in Game 1 against the Guardians in the ALDS. He's thrown as many as 100 pitches only eight times in 68 starts the last two years, postseason included. Still, if there was ever a time to push Skubal beyond his usual limit, Game 5 was it. Instead, he came out after 99 pitches, and the bullpen blew the lead. \"He's pitched on regular rest now three or four starts in a row. He empties his tank from pitch one,\" Hinch said about Skubal. \"It was an easy decision.\"\nUltimately, Skubal's early-ish exit is just a footnote in the Game 5 loss. Detroit's bullpen did incredible work. Seven relievers, including Game 3 starter Jack Flaherty, allowed just two runs in 8 ⅓ innings. The offense mustered only five hits in 10 innings -- 10 innings! -- against Seattle's bullpen. Blame the offense, not Skubal's possibly early exit. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        AUSTIN, Texas -- The day before the U.S. men's national team's friendly against Ecuador, head coach Mauricio Pochettino wasted no time reminding everyone that his focus for the time being is performance rather than results. He got a game that encapsulated that exact sentiment on Friday night at Q2 Stadium, where the USMNT came from behind and settled for a 1-1 draw, showcasing some genuine signs of progress and lending credence to Pochettino's idea that the team is, at long last, trending in the right direction.Pochettino's first year in the job was marked by unimpressive -- and at times, uninspiring -- results, but as he celebrates a year in the role, the USMNT have traded a sense of doom and gloom for some downright normalcy. In some sense, they were merely the latest victims of Ecuador's egregiously defensive approach that saw them finish second in CONMEBOL's World Cup qualifying competition despite scoring just 14 goals in 18 games, the 35-year-old (or ageless) Enner Valencia nicking a goal from a quick counterattack before the half-hour mark. The U.S. team were not exactly perfect throughout, the midfield trio of Weston McKennie, Tanner Tessman and Aidan Morris not always clicking after months away from a group with a new look, while the hosts were a little bit wasteful in attack as the game continued. None of the USMNT's issues on Friday evening, though, seemed atypical of a team that still has eight months to go before the opening game of the World Cup.As Pochettino marks his first anniversary, the stamp he is beginning to leave on the team is clear and was on full display against Ecuador. While a newfound competitiveness for playing time was apparent from the moment the roster dropped last week, Pochettino's version of the USMNT has a tactical flexibility that the previous iteration under his predecessor Gregg Berhalter did not. The back three he debuted in last month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan returned against Ecuador, this time with some new tweaks -- or specifically, a different look in and out of possession.\"I think we keep, now, playing the way that we plan to play,\" Pochettino said after the match. \"I think we defend with a back four, two midfielders and three and one and of course, the 'keeper -- 1-4-2-3-1 -- but then our formation building from [the] back, we [were] building with three, two and then five.\"\nThe personnel choices were equally as intriguing, with Miles Robinson joining mainstays Chris Richards and Tim Ream at center back while Max Arfsten and Tim Weah balanced each other out in respective roles on the left and right flanks. Weah described his role pre-match as the one of the \"fake wingback,\" simply explaining afterward that \"I would be doing less defending 'cause Miles was covering the whole time so that was pretty much it and in the attack, I was playing like a normal winger.\" Pochettino noted how Arfsten, a more traditional fullback, and Weah's distinct styles added new layers to Friday's game plan.\"That is about hav[ing] different dimensions but that change depends on, also, the position of how we want to attack, how we want to use the channels, how we want to be vigilant if [the opponents] play with one striker, two strikers,\" Pochettino said.\"That is really important and we start to see how [to] change the set-up depend[ing] on the height [of the defensive line] of the opposition -- low block, medium block -- or when you are in the opposite half, different situations can happen. My appreciation, my opinion on his performance is that I think he did well. He did well when he was a winger trying to go in the diagonal to try to create chances. He had a few shots from the outside of the box and then when he was like a wingback because, [Pervis] Estupinan first and then when [Yaimar] Medina [was switched] in, to force him to defend a little bit closer than Miles and then close to [substitute] Alex Freeman.\"There was still a mixed bag element from the USMNT, the team openly admitting that they could have turned more of their 11 shots into clear-cut opportunities. That said, there was a clear idea at play. Each time the USMNT had the ball -- which was often in a game in which they had nearly 65% possession -- the emphasis was to attack as quickly and cohesively as possible. Their attacking outing was also impressive in its own right considering the circumstances -- Sebastian Beccacece's Ecuador conceded just five goals in 18 World Cup qualification matches and it is not all that hard to envision a reality in which a more clinical USMNT would have scored multiple goals against them. Even if a draw is a fair enough result for both sides, the game started to tilt in the U.S.' favor in the second half.\n\"We started to look the fresher team as the game wore on and listen, as someone who's been on the other side of that, you know and you smell that,\" Ream said. \"You're like, okay, these guys … are starting to be a little bit gassed and you actually feel more energized and it allows you to get on top of them more and start making more little plays, being connected better. I think we were connected pretty well in the first half but even closer connections in the second half and I'll tell you what, it takes a toll on teams and it did that today.\"This version of the team felt incomplete in part because Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Tyler Adams were not in the starting lineup for varying reasons -- Pulisic came on as a substitute and Robinson is not fully fit yet, while Adams did not make the trip as he and his wife await the birth of their second child. None of this comes as a surprise at this point and there are still questions to be answered about what the USMNT is capable of if those players are not on the field, especially Adams. The puzzle pieces feel like they are starting to finally come together, though, with a handful of standout individual performances headlined by Malik Tillman, who continued to prove his worth as one of Pochettino's breakouts with the assist to the USMNT's second-half goal. The credit for that, in the end, went to Folarin Balogun, who has two goals and one assist in his three games under Pochettino so far, reasserting himself once again as Pochettino's go-to No. 9.The normalcy of the moment was not lost on Pochettino, either.\"I think the performance was a very, very serious performance, very professional,\" he said. \"I think what works the most is that we are here talking about actions, concepts, formations, things like this that for me, after one year, I am so, so, so happy that we don't talk about other things like commitment, attitude or things that normally in the past we were talking [about]. I think that this is a massive step up because I think we need to forget that always, win or lose, it depends [on] our performance. If we are better and [if] we make sure we are better than our opponent, we can win. If we don't show that, it's because it's a soccer problem, not [that] it's another problem that is dangerous when these types of things happen in a team.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        On Saturday, WWE Crown Jewel takes place outside Saudi Arabia for the first time since the event's inception. This year's event will be held in Perth, Australia, though it will operate under the same format as last year's Crown Jewel.That means two headline matches featuring WWE's top champions. On the men's side, undisputed WWE champion Cody Rhodes will take on world heavyweight champion Seth Rollins. For the women, world champion Iyo Sky will face WWE women's champion Tiffany Stratton. The winners of those matches will win the ceremonial Crown Jewel championship, taking home a ring for their victory.In addition, John Cena returns for one of his final appearances when he takes on AJ Styles as the two revisit one of the promotion's top rivalries of the 2010s. Cena has been out of action since Wrestlepalooza and only has a handful of appearances booked through the end of the year, when he is expected to retire. Styles, meanwhile, also recently said he expects to retire by the end of 2026.Plus, roman Reigns makes his return to a PPV card when he takes on Bronson Reed in n Australian Street Fight. And Asuka and Kairi Sane are set to team up and face Iyo Sky and Rhea Ripley.\n\n        \n            \n                John Cena admits his WWE heel turn failed: 'I went out there and bombed'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith so many big matches set for the event, let's take a look at what the CBS Sports pro wrestling experts think will happen when the action goes down in Perth.2025 WWE Crown Jewel predictionsMen's Crown Jewel Championship -- Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins: The Crown Jewel stipulation is tailor-made for Rhodes to lose. It's meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Rhodes solidified himself as a top draw by repeatedly beating Rollins upon his return to WWE. It's about time Rollins got one over on \"The American Nightmare.\" On Raw, CM Punk teased that he respects Rhodes too much to get involved in his business, suggesting The Vision's numbers game could get the better of the son of a son of a plumber. Pick: Seth Rollins wins -- Shakiel MahjouriMaybe I lean too heavily into what would be most interesting rather than what WWE is likely to do. Rhodes having Rollins' number and causing a crisis of confidence for The Vision's leader is interesting; Rollins winning with the assistance of Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker is not. Similarly, Rollins winning on his own doesn't really do much for how the story of The Vision is being constructed. Paul Heyman already sent a message to Rollins that a loss was unacceptable and would make him question the decision to back Rollins over Roman Reigns. Would Breakker be content to sit behind a man who can't get the job done against Rhodes? The most interesting option is for Rhodes to win, so that's what WWE should do. Pick: Cody Rhodes wins -- Brent Brookhouse\nWomen's Crown Jewel Championship -- Tiffany Stratton vs. Stephanie Vaquer: Vaquer is a fresh champion who needs to continue building credibility as a main event-level star. Stratton has had a good run with her title, so a loss isn't particularly damaging in the same way it would be for Vaquer. That makes for some pretty simple math that just says to give Vaquer the victory. Pick: Stephanie Vaquer wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)John Cena vs. AJ Styles: Cena vs. Styles is the most deserving farewell tour match requiring the least storyline build. They had shockingly great matches at the height of their rivalry. That's enough to warrant one last tango. It's just a shame most of Cena's retirement tour has been half-baked. Cena's loss to Brock Lesnar at Wrestlepalooza really deflated fans. It's unlikely he takes another clean loss with his final match fast approaching. Styles, who recently said he'd retire next year, doesn't have much to gain by beating Cena. All anyone wants to see is one more solid outing from one of the most surprising hit feuds in WWE history. Pick: John Cena wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)Roman Reigns vs. Bronson Reed: Reigns matches are so rare that it makes the results fairly predictable. Reed has been around to give Reigns someone he can defeat to stay around the title picture without actually being in it. It's hard to imagine Reed being given a win over Reigns. What purpose would that serve? To set up a third Reigns vs. Reed match? That doesn't seem like a good way to use Reigns moving forward. That should mean a win for Reigns so he can move on to Breakker. Pick: Roman Reigns wins -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)\nRhea Ripley & Iyo Sky vs. The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kairi Sane): Ripley and Sky are bigger stars than The Kabuki Warriors. Plain and simple. It doesn't seem WWE has much planned long-term for the villainous duo, at least not enough to give them a win over two of the women's division's biggest stars. This match is mostly an excuse to get Ripley in front of her home fans. Expect \"Mami\" to pick up a big win for her fellow Aussies. Pick: Rhea Ripley & Iyo Sky win -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Alex Pereira and Magomed Ankalaev are worse for wear after UFC 320. Pereira, the UFC light heavyweight champion, broke his foot during his main event fight on Oct. 6. Meanwhile, reports claim Ankalaev fought with a broken rib.Pereira is shockingly compromised despite how quickly he decimated Ankalaev at UFC 320. After knocking out Ankalaev in 80 seconds, \"Poatan\" limped out of the Octagon with what he believed was a broken foot. On Friday, Pereira confirmed a foot fracture during a Q&A in Rio de Janeiro.\"I did an X-Ray in Las Vegas and an MRI here, and we have a fracture on  my foot, but I still don't know what will happen, or how long it will  take for me to recover,\" Pereira said, according to MMA Fighting, before Saturday's UFC Fight Night. A broken foot normally requires four to six weeks to heal, with a maximum of 12 weeks, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Once healed, it can take six months for the bone to support weight-bearing demands for greater physical activity. A worst-case timeline could sideline Pereira until April. \"Poatan\" continued advocating for a White House fight with Jon Jones, which would give him approximately 8-9 weeks to train after he's fully healed if he's out until April.\"I think it's good to focus  on this White House [date], it's something that interests me,\" Pereira said. \"I think  I'll focus on this.\" Last week, Pereira detailed the moment he believes the injury occurred.\n\"It's my foot,\" Pereira, wearing a boot, told reporters, via a Portuguese interpreter, at the UFC 320 post-fight press conference. \"I'm pretty sure it's broken. The inside calf kicks were working. I threw a few of those, and then he  switched stances, and I think I was in the wrong range. And I threw  another kick to his lead leg, and it landed on the tip of my foot. I  think it's broken.\"\n        \n            \n                Conor McGregor suspended 18 months for UFC anti-doping violation\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile Pereira believes he suffered the injury in the fight, Ankalaev might have entered the fight with an injury of his own. Ali Abdelaziz, Ankalaev's manager, claimed there were many reasons Ankalaev should not have followed through with the fight, but wouldn't specify why.\"There are a lot of things happened with Ankalaev in his camp,\" Abdelaziz posted on Instagram. \"But, it's  for him to talk about. Not me. And if I need to talk about it, I will  talk about it. If it was up to me, he should never have fought due to  some things. But he's a grown man, he makes his own decisions, and he  lives by his actions.\" On Monday, reports emerged that Ankalaev fought Pereira with a broken rib. Léo Guimaraes, whose Twitter bio describes him as a combat sports journalist, posted a video of Ankalaev undergoing rib treatment approximately 20 days before the fight.

    "body": "\n        The Seattle Mariners were eliminated from the playoffs on Monday night, losing Game 7 of the American League Championship Series to the Toronto Blue Jays. The Mariners, who at times in the best-of-seven series held both a 2-0 and 3-2 advantage, led by a 3-1 score entering the bottom of the seventh inning. That's when Blue Jays star George Springer, hobbled earlier in the series when he was struck by an errant pitch to his right knee, unloaded what proved to be a decisive three-run home run.\nJust as notable as Springer's home run, the 23rd of his postseason career, was what happened right beforehand, when Mariners manager Dan Wilson made a pitching change. Wilson, in his first full year at the helm, removed right-hander Bryan Woo in favor of Eduard Bazardo. For as good as Bazardo was during the regular season, when he appeared 73 times and amassed a 2.52 ERA (150 ERA+), it's only natural that folks second-guessed Wilson and wondered if he should've gone directly to closer Andrés Muñoz.\"Bazardo's been doing it all season long and has been so consistent at it and he's done such a good job all year,\" Wilson said after the game. \"We felt really comfortable with him out there, the way he's been throwing the ball, especially in this series, and it was a good spot for him.\"Bazardo, for his part, had actually held righties to a lower OPS this season than Muñoz. And, to Wilson's point, Bazardo had appeared three times in the ALCS prior to Monday and had limited the Blue Jays to one run on three hits and four strikeouts. Those marks included an appearance in Sunday's Game 6, when he threw two scoreless innings. \nNotably, Bazardo faced Springer in that outing, throwing him two sinkers, with the second located in roughly the same spot as the one he homered against in Game 7.\"I mean, you make your decisions, and sometimes you have to live and die with it,\" Wilson said. \"I think, again, the way Bazardo has thrown the ball all season long, we were comfortable with where we were and it just, again, didn't go our way.\"\nIn turn, the Mariners will now head home for the winter, having come within a single win of reaching the World Series for the first time in franchise history.\n            ",

The Buccaneers are hopeful that Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka (both battling hamstring injuries) will be able to play tonight and that certainly lends itself well to scoring.

The Seahawks have been anything but, ranking first in yards per play with an elite passing attack that has a chance to beat Houston's pass defense in a strength vs. strength matchup,\" CBS Sports Gambling and Fantasy editor R.J. White said. \"The major edge is on the other side of the ball, as the Seahawks also have an elite defense while the Texans offense looked awful prior to its uncompetitive matchups.\" Back the Seahawks at BetMGM Sportsbook now:Mariners money line vs. Blue Jays (+110)\"Recency bias can be hard to overlook in a crucial game seven to decide who goes to the World Series. The Toronto Blue Jays have captured that with winning three out of the past four games over Seattle.

    "body": "\n        Mike Evans, one of the NFL's most durable and productive players for the past decade, will miss most of the remaining games on the Buccaneers' regular season schedule after breaking his collarbone, Tampa Bay coach Todd Bowles said following Monday night's 24-9 loss to the Lions. Evans, who was labeled as questionable prior to the game with a hamstring issue, left the game after nearly coming down with a deep pass from quarterback Baker Mayfield with five minutes to play in the first half. Evans stayed on the ground for several moments before being helped off the field. He was carted into the Buccaneers' locker room shortly thereafter. A perennial Pro Bowl receiver, injuries have limited Evans to four games this season. He caught just 14 of 28 targets for 140 yards and one touchdown during his first three games of the 2025 season. Evans did not catch any of his four targets on Monday night prior to getting injured.\nThe 32-year-old Evans tied Jerry Rice's NFL record last year by recording his 11th consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season. Evans' 11 consecutive seasons with 1,000 receiving yards is the most in NFL history to start a career. \nTampa Bay, who trailed Detroit 14-0 at the time of Evans' injury, has dealt with a litany of injuries this season. Along with Evans, the Buccaneers have also dealt with injuries to fellow starters Chris Godwin, Bucky Irving, Emeka Egbuka, Calijah Kancey and Cody Mauch, among others. Despite their injury issues, the Buccaneers won five of their first six games and are in their familiar spot atop the NFC South standings. Without Evans, Mayfield will have to rely more on fellow wideouts Egbuka, Tez Johnson and Sterling Shepard. Egbuka caught just 4 of 12 targets for 58 yards on Monday while playing through a hamstring injury. Johnson, a rookie seventh-round pick, also caught four passes for 58 yards against the Lions that included his second touchdown catch in as many games. Evans is one of the most decorated players in Buccaneers history. This summer, he was ranked by the team as the fourth-greatest player in team history as part of the franchise's 50th anniversary celebration. \nA valuable member of Tampa Bay's Super Bowl LV championship team, Evans is 10th all-time with 106 career touchdown catches. He is 22nd all-time with 12,824 career receiving yards and 34th all-time with 850 receptions. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Tennessee Titans wide receiver Tyler Lockett asked for his release from the team and was granted it, per ESPN. The 33-year-old pass-catcher is now free to choose his next NFL home.Lockett was not a major contributor for the 1-6 Titans, as he caught just 10 passes for 70 yards in seven games played. His 21 targets ranked fifth on the team, behind Calvin Ridley along with rookie wideouts Elic Ayomanor and Chimere Dike.\n        \n            \n                Kayshon Boutte says Patriots took advantage of 'lazy cornerback play' vs. Titans\n                \n                    Chris Bengel                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLockett, who said he grew up a Titans fan after the team drafted Vince Young in 2006, signed a one-year, $4 million deal this offseason with Tennessee that was worth up to $6 million. The Seattle Seahawks legend was released in March by the team that selected him in the third round back in 2015 after 10 productive seasons. Lockett left Seattle as the franchise's No. 2 all-time leading receiver, having caught 661 passes for 8,594 yards and 61 touchdowns. Only Steve Largent has caught more passes, touchdowns and recorded more receiving yards in a Seahawks uniform. Lockett's production has dipped over four straight seasons. In 2024, he caught 49 passes for 600 yards and two touchdowns for the Seahawks. While he's an older player, there could be some interest in the veteran wide receiver. Let's take a look at a handful of potential landing spots for Lockett.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Lockett could join forces with Pete Carroll and the Las Vegas Seahawks -- I mean, Raiders. Geno Smith has struggled mightily with his new team and this new wide receiving corps, which could be set to lose Jakobi Meyers at the trade deadline. Lockett doesn't automatically turn Vegas into a contender, but it would make life a bit easier on Smith and the passing game. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Through six games, there is just one player on the Pittsburgh Steelers that has recorded more than 187 yards receiving, and that's DK Metcalf. Not only would this hypothetical move reunite Lockett with Metcalf, but give Aaron Rodgers another reliable veteran. The Steelers passing attack ranks in the bottom half of the league, so adding a player like Lockett makes some sense.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike Vrabel just won his revenge game against the Titans, and now could pick up a discarded weapon Tennessee wasn't too interested in using. The New England Patriots wide receiving corps is not as bad as many believed it would be entering this season. Stefon Diggs has 456 yards receiving, Kayshon Boutte has emerged as a WR2 and then Mack Hollins and DeMario Douglas have been sprinkled in effectively as well. New England's passing attack now ranks No. 9 in the NFL (239 yards per game). Lockett could be another pass-catcher that helps Drake Maye gear up for his MVP run. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ricky Pearsall missed last week with a knee injury, Jauan Jennings is dealing with ankle, rib and shoulder injuries, and then Brandon Aiyuk is not ready to make his 2025 debut just yet. Despite all of the injuries, the San Francisco 49ers sit atop the NFC West at 5-2. They could plan on bringing a former rival in to aid the passing game. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Perhaps Lockett could return home. Seattle doesn't have a glaring need at receiver with Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp and Tory Horton leading the way for Sam Darnold, but the Seahawks didn't completely close the door on Lockett returning when the team released him this offseason. Seahawks general manager John Schneider said at the time, \"Go out and see what's shaking [on the market], and we'll stay in touch.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NBA season is set to tip off on Tuesday night, which meant Monday was the last day to take care of offseason business. The deadline for rookie scale extensions (and some veteran deals) for the 2022 draft class arrived at 6 p.m. ET, and a number of players inked long-term money to avoid hitting free agency next summer, while others were left without a fresh contract.The easy extensions were done quickly, as stars like Paolo Banchero, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams all signed new deals earlier this offseason. The ones that come down to the deadline are usually a bit more contentious negotiations, with two sides not seeing entirely eye-to-eye. As sports fans are well aware, deadlines create action, and over the past week we've seen a flurry of deals get hammered out to avoid any awkwardness going into this season.At the same time, there are players who will head into the 2025-26 season without a long-term commitment, hoping to prove their value to not only their current team but the entire league before they have a chance to enter free agency either this coming summer or the next. \nWith the deadline come and gone, we wanted to highlight the winners and losers of the NBA's extension season. Winner: Kevin Durant and the Houston Rockets The Rockets held firm in talks with KD about not giving him a max deal, and ultimately the two sides were able to find a happy middle ground at two years, $90 million. That's still a big contract for Durant going into his age-38 and -39 seasons, but he's shown few signs of slowing down and remains one of the game's elite offensive weapons. Durant wanted to be in Houston and gets a sizable contract, but shows his commitment to trying to win by not demanding the absolute max he could've received. That's not for nothing. \nThe Rockets traded for Durant in hopes of creating an immediate title window, and by locking Durant in for the next three seasons, they've done just that. Had the two sides ended up in a stalemate, the pressure would've intensified on Houston to win a title this season, and while the expectations are still to contend, they'll feel like they've given themselves a three-year window to compete. Loser: Trae Young There was a time not long ago where Young would've had a max extension waiting for him in July, the moment the Hawks could've offered it. But as teams adapt to the new restrictions of the apron era, stars like Young are no longer going to get those offers by default. The Hawks seem willing to take this into the summer and let the market prove to Young what's out there for him if he chooses to decline his player option. To be clear, Young will be fine long-term and will undoubtedly get a big pay day next summer if he and the Hawks don't reach an extension during this season. That said, he's among the first young stars to face the apron squeeze after watching so many around him get locked in. Making matters more frustrating is that he finally has the kind of supporting cast around him in Atlanta that seems optimal for maximizing his strengths and masking his weaknesses, but he's not guaranteed to be in that situation long-term. \nThe good news for Young is that he will have the chance to show what he can do in an apparent ideal team environment, but even if that kind of \"prove it\" season shouldn't be necessary. Winner: Christian BraunBraun's five-year, $125 million deal was on the high end of projections for what the Nuggets' guard would get in extension talks. Denver clearly believes last year's offensive leap from Braun was just the beginning, as he averaged 15.4 points per game on 58.0/39.7/82.7 shooting splits -- all career bests. They rewarded him with a substantial extension to be part of their new core alongside Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon and Cam Johnson. Braun went from a decent bench player to a crucial starter last year, and seizing on that opportunity paid off in the form of a very significant pay raise. For the Nuggets, they don't have a ton of avenues to upgrade their roster, having already pulled the trigger on trading Michael Porter Jr. for Johnson. That was their only chance at a major trade, and on paper it looks like a home run. They're all-in on this group, but if Braun's shooting improvement holds, he is a near-perfect shooting guard for this team. \nBraun's development into a quality starter was a necessity for Denver to extend their title window with Jokić and they were not going to risk letting him walk or ruining their good vibes by letting this become a restricted free agent standoff.Loser: Los Angeles LakersThe Lakers couldn't extend Austin Reaves by Monday's deadline, not because they didn't want to but due to the restrictions on what they were allowed to offer. The max L.A. could offer Reaves was four years, $89 million, which is well off what he's projected to get in free agency. While Reaves has stated his desire to stay with the Lakers long-term, he will be an unrestricted free agent next summer and there is always some uncertainty that comes with that. Perhaps Reaves would've been willing to sign a hometown discount type deal this offseason to stay with the Lakers, but with deals projected near $40 million annually (or more) on the table next summer, it'll be much harder for Reaves to ignore what other teams will be offering. This is where the CBA can hurt teams that make savvy signings, and with Reaves vastly over-performing his current deal, the Lakers had no shot to lock him in long-term this summer. \nNow they'll have to wait until next July to get a deal done and hope someone doesn't woo Reaves away with an offer they aren't willing to match.Winner: Portland Trail BlazersThe Blazers locked in two of their young core pieces over the weekend. First they signed Toumani Camara, a breakout defensive star from last year, to a four-year, $82 million extension. Shortly after, they inked Shaedon Sharpe to a four-year, $90 million extension that keeps that pair in Portland long-term. Given the kind of money we've seen thrown around lately, being able to lock up two quality players with upside to 8-figure deals is a win for Portland. There is still a speculative element to Sharpe, but he showed some real growth last year, taking a major stride in terms of his efficiency as a finisher in his third season. He averaged 18.5 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, and while the 3-point shot is still the big question that will determine exactly what level of offensive threat he becomes, he's started to harness his explosiveness and has real star upside (especially if the shooting ever clicks). \nWith Camara, they get an elite-level defender on the wing to sign for a team-friendly number. That $82 million figure is extremely reasonable for an All-Defense caliber forward who also shot 37.5% from 3-point range last season. To get that kind of deal done without needing to squeeze a guy in restricted free agency (which always strains the player-team relationship) is a win for the Blazers. Loser: Tyler HerroComing off a career year, Herro is also extension eligible, but all indications are he won't be getting an extension from Miami right now. The Heat are prioritizing flexibility for the summer of 2027, when a number of big names could hit free agency. Miami has long looked to capitalize on their status as a free-agent destination, but for a player like Herro, he will wonder why there's no urgency to lock him down long-term. Herro proved last year he can be an offensive engine as a lead scorer but, like Trae Young, his deficiencies as a defender lead to questions about the ceiling of a team built around a player of that archetype. Teams simply aren't as eager to offer max-type deals to players of that profile anymore. Adding to some of the stress for Herro is that he's going to miss time to start this season after offseason foot surgery and Miami isn't expected to be a strong contender, even in a weakened Eastern Conference. \nThat will make it tough for him to add another All-Star appearance to his résumé and if the Heat aren't rushing to get a deal done with him off of his sensational 2024-25 campaign, one has to wonder what his market will look like in two summers. Winner: Keegan MurrayThere was a time after his rookie year where Keegan Murray might've expected to be in the max extension conversation, but after a pair of down years from 3-point range, Murray still worked out a five-year, $140 million deal to stay with the Kings. Sacramento has not been an ideal situation for a young complementary player like Murray over the past two seasons. Injuries, trades, coaching changes and roster turnover have made it difficult for him to find that same level of comfort from his rookie season when the Kings broke out of their playoff drought. Even so, the Kings still clearly believe in the talent, and were willing to give Murray a very large, albeit not max, contract offer this summer. \nWe have seen some players turn that down in the past, but as often as we praise those who bet on themselves, there's something to be said for not letting a good opportunity slip by. Murray has undoubtedly seen how stingy teams have been in restricted free agency in recent years, and for players that aren't clearly max guys, the offers don't often increase during an RFA standoff. He wouldn't have to look far to see what happened to Jonathan Kuminga in Golden State and, whether he believes he can take on a bigger role or not, that opportunity likely isn't out there next summer. Add in the general uncertainty of the Kings' roster, and there's no guarantee he'd even have the chance to really prove he's worth more.Loser: Detroit PistonsThe Pistons didn't work out deals with Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren and will now wait until next summer to figure out the futures of their young guard and center. Ivey not getting an extension isn't a surprise given his injury history, as both sides want to see how he performs this season (once he's back from his latest injury). Not signing Duren feels like the miss for Detroit. Perhaps they'll get him at a good number next summer, but he was pivotal for them last year and took real strides on both ends of the court. For a team trying to build off that season but needing internal development to do so after making moves on the margins this summer, not getting Duren locked in feels like it could work negatively for all parties. \nThis was a chance to reward him for his performance last year and show some belief in him coming off a career year, but instead you run the risk of him questioning the team's commitment to him. The Pistons don't have any great long-term options beyond Duren at center, and sometimes playing hardball on an extension can disrupt the positive vibes in the locker room and needs to play into the calculus for a front office. Winner: Dyson DanielsDaniels' four-year, $100 million extension is a massive deal for a player who wasn't projected anywhere near that kind of money a year ago. However, when you put up a season that wins you Most Improved Player and lands you a first-team All-Defense spot, averaging 3 steals per game, you gain some serious leverage in extension talks. There were reports that Daniels' camp was hoping for a similar deal to Jalen Suggs' five-year, $150 million deal in Orlando, but he still lands a $25 million per year deal. For a guy who had failed to carve out a major role in his first two years in New Orleans, he's a testament to what the right situation can do for a young player. From the Hawks' perspective, they are able to lock up an elite point of attack defender for a reasonable price that pairs with Jalen Johnson's extension from last summer to give them a strong defensive foundation. GM Onsi Saleh continues to make savvy moves in his first summer in charge in Atlanta and now he's rewarded Daniels with a handsome extension without bending much in negotiations. Daniels is a near-perfect complement for Trae Young in the backcourt given what he can do to mask Young's defensive deficiencies, and if he can continue to improve into even a league-average shooter, this deal will age well in Atlanta.Loser: Tari EasonWhile the Rockets got new deals for Jabari Smith Jr. and Kevin Durant this summer, Tari Eason ended up as the odd man out. With Amen Thompson needing an extension next summer, it was hard for Houston to feel comfortable paying Eason what he wanted. Eason is coming off of a solid year (12.0 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.7 steals, 0.9 blocks per game) and is a big part of their defensive depth, but at some point it becomes tough to pay everyone when you're a team like the Rockets. The problem Eason faces is he might not have a ton of opportunity to show he can do a lot more given the depth of this Rockets team on the wing. That means he'll go into restricted free agency needing some team to really value what he can bring defensively to want to push the Rockets with an offer sheet. Considering we've seen very few offer sheets in recent years, that's unlikely to happen, and Eason will likely find himself in the same kind of restricted free agent purgatory that a number of players found themselves this summer. \n            ",

The former No. 1 overall pick's resurgence with the Buccaneers in 2024 was eye-opening. He threw for 4,500 yards, 41 touchdowns, and had a passer rating of 106.8 across 17 games. He also rushed for a career-high 378 yards, showing his dual-threat ability. Through six weeks in 2025, Mayfield has continued to excel, posting 1,539 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and only one interception through six games with a passer rating of 108.5. He is now listed among the top contenders to win the 2025 NFL MVP award. See who else to roster here.Part of Kaylor's optimal NFL DFS strategy also includes rostering Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs. The former Alabama standout has emerged as a dynamic offensive weapon for the Lions. In 2024, he rushed 250 times for 1,412 yards and scored 16 rushing touchdowns, while also adding 52 receptions for 517 yards and four receiving touchdowns. That performance earned him a second Pro Bowl nod and established him as one of the league's most efficient all-purpose backs. Through the early part of 2025, he has continued to produce, carrying the ball 87 times for 390 yards (4.5 yards per carry) and finding the end zone four times, while adding 23 receptions for 112 yards. While his per-carry average dipped slightly compared to 2024, his explosiveness and versatility continue to define his value to the Lions' offense. You can see the rest of Kaylor's NFL DFS picks here.New users can see the latest FanDuel promo code to get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to build NFL DFS lineups for Monday Night FootballKaylor is also targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Monday Night Football.'

    "body": "\nFormer Tampa Bay Buccaneers All-Pro running back and Boise State star Doug Martin died while in police custody following a struggle with officers who were investigating a break-in at a home in Oakland, California, on Sunday according to the Oakland Police Department. Martin, 36, became unresponsive after his arrest and was transported to the hospital after receiving medical aid on the scene. A cause of death has not been released, though the Alameda County Coroner's Office will do an autopsy to determine what happened.A first-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2012 NFL Draft, Martin played seven seasons in the pros prior to his career ending after a brief stint with the Oakland Raiders.Oakland police said Monday that Martin \"was involved in a break-in at a residence in Oakland,\" and as officers were attempting to detain him, a \"brief struggle occurred\" with Martin becoming unresponsive after being taken into custody.\"Paramedics responded to the scene, provided medical aid, and transported Martin to a local hospital, where he later died,\" police said. \"Since Saturday, OPD has been in contact with Martin's family. The family has requested privacy as they grieve this tragic loss. No additional details are being released at this time, as this remains an ongoing investigation.\"The officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave.Athletes First and agency CEO Brian Murphy, who represented Martin, released an additional statement on behalf of his family. Within the statement, it was revealed that Martin battled menal health challenges \"that profoundly impacted his personal and professional life.\"\"Ultimately, mental illness proved to be the one opponent from which Doug could not run,\" the statement continued. \"Following recent media reports about Doug's untimely passing, the family wishes to clarify the circumstances. Doug's parents were actively seeking medical assistance for him and had contacted local authorities for support. Feeling overwhelmed and disoriented, Doug fled his home during the night and entered a neighbor's residence two doors down, where he was taken into custody by police.\"Martin rushed for 1,454 yards as a rookie in 2012 before playing in only 17 games over his next two years with the Buccaneers. Martin's resurgence was notable in 2015 when he posted an All-Pro and Pro Bowl season in which he rushed for 1,402 yards. \nThat offseason, Tampa Bay signed Martin to a five-year, $35 million contract extension. He struggled thereafter for the NFC South franchise with a suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy causing him to miss multiple games at the end of the year. The suspension came amid Martin being benched while the Buccaneers were making a playoff push during the 2016 season. The franchise released Martin after the 2017 season, and he later signed with the Raiders to back up Marshawn Lynch.Known for his bruising style at 5-feet-9 and 225 pounds, Martin starred at Boise State and earned the nickname \"Muscle Hamster\" during his time on the blue turf. \nPrior to Heisman finalist Ashton Jeanty's career, Martin was considered one of the top ballcarriers in program history after ranking third all-time at the school with 43 rushing touchdowns and 48 total touchdowns, fifth with 3,431 yards and sixth with 617 rushing attempts.\n            ",

Coming into the game with a questionable tag, Evans will be active for the first time in almost a month, sources told CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz.Furthermore, Emeka Egbuka, who suffered a hamstring injury last week and was also listed as questionable, worked out pregame and will play, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler.Evans suffered a hamstring injury in the Buccaneers' Week 3 win over the New York Jets and hasn't played since, but he was able to log a full practice on Saturday, the team's final practice of the week. Prior to going down with the injury, Evans caught 14 passes for 140 yards and a touchdown.\n        \n            \n                Lions vs. Buccaneers prediction: Can Baker Mayfield maintain MVP-caliber play in possible playoff preview?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWith Evans back on the field, he can continue his pursuit of a 12th consecutive 1,000-yard season. Assuming he stays healthy, Evans will need to average 61.4 yards per game to hit that mark. Given the play of quarterback Baker Mayfield to this point, that's certainly doable.\nEgbuka's availability is also a considerable boost. The star rookie out of Ohio State did not practice Thursday or Friday and managed only a limited practice Saturday, but he's good to go for game action. He has 27 targets for 469 yards and five touchdowns this year and has been the most consistent presence among the Bucaneers' three-headed wide receiver monster of Evans, Egbuka and Chris Godwin, who will miss Monday night's game with a fibula injury.Tampa Bay is yet to have all three players on the field at once this season. \nIn spite of those injuries and more -- starting running back Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) remains out, and multiple starting offensive linemen are done for the season -- the Buccaneers occupy first place in the NFC South with a 5-1 record. That's due in no small part to the efforts Mayfield, who has played at an MVP level with 1,539 passing yards, 12 passing touchdowns and 158 rushing yards.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        In the top of the fifth inning on Oct. 8, 2015, a 26-year-old outfielder by the name of George Springer hit a home run in Game 1 of the ALDS against the eventual World Series champ Kansas City Royals. Little did we know at the time just where this career -- specifically the postseason career -- would go. On Monday night, almost exactly a decade later, Springer hit a go-ahead, three-run shot that ended up being an ALCS-clinching blast.This was not an outlier but rather a continuation of a trend that started with Springer back on that Thursday evening in K.C. against the top-seeded, defending American League champions. \nGame 7 Monday night was Springer's 78th career playoff game. He now has 23 home runs and 47 RBI in his postseason career, littered among so many huge hits. It's rare for a series to go by without him hitting a home run, in fact. He's played in 17 different series. If we eliminate series of two games or fewer, Springer has hit a home run in 11 of 13 series. He's hit multiple home runs in seven different series and at least three home runs in a series three times, including the 2025 ALCS. Not only that, he nearly bookended the thing, leading off Game 1 with a home run and then hitting one in the bottom of the seventh inning in Game 7. On the all-time leaderboard for postseason home run, Springer is now tied with Kyle Schwarber and trails only Manny Ramirez (29) and former teammate Jose Altuve (27). It hasn't been only home runs, of course. Springer has been the catalyst as a top-of-the-order hitter on many successful playoff runs. He also has 20 doubles. His 54 runs scored rank 12th all time. Among players with at least 200 postseason plate appearances, his .540 slugging percentage is 13th all-time, five points better than Mickey Mantle (Mr. October, Reggie Jackson, sits at .527). \nThree of his most clutch hits came in 2017, en route to winning the Astros' first-ever championship: In the top of the 11th inning in Game 2 of the 2017 World Series, with the Astros already down 1-0 in the series, Springer hit a two-run homer that would end up being the game-winner. In the top of the second in Game 7 of the 2017 World Series, Springer hit a two-run home run to increase the lead to 5-0 Astros, making what looked like a workable deficit for the Dodgers into a pretty comfortable lead for the Astros. He previously led off the game with a double and scored the first run. Arguably his biggest to date was the seventh-inning shot in Game 5 of the 2017 World Series. It was 8-7 Dodgers at the time with the series knotted at two games apiece. Springer hit a rocket up over the train tracks in Minute Maid Park, sending Houston into an utter frenzy. \"That was just special,\" Springer recalled to CBS Sports in September. \"It was one of those moments where you hit it and all your emotions come out. It was obviously a big spot. \"It was just kind of a very emotional, I guess, hit.\" Way to undersell it, huh? It was much more than a hit. Just like the hit in Game 7 of the 2025 ALCS. We can add this newest blast to the list. If the Blue Jays go on to win the World Series, which would be their first since 1993, we could well make an argument to place that one at the top.\nBut no matter what happens, Playoff George Springer continues to terrorize opposing pitching staffs in October.\n            ",

That timeline suggests Overshown could return after the team's Week 10 bye for Week 11 at the Las Vegas Raiders on \"Monday Night Football.\"Overshown tore his ACL for the second time in his career on Thanksgiving last season. Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer confirmed that Overshown's window had opened, along with those for third-round rookie cornerback Shavon Revel Jr. (knee) and starting center Cooper Beebe (ankle). Wide receiver Jonathan Mingo (knee) will be activated this week from injured reserve. Beebe has been working in the rehab group at Dallas practice the past few weeks along with Overshown and Revel.\n\"Don't predict they're all playing, but again, we're excited to get those guys back. They've worked so hard. Demo [Overshown] and Von [Revel] and really all the guys have worked so hard to get back that I'm excited to get them out there. But we'll be smart, and we'll ramp them up and see how they do\"Here's the outlook for Overshown and Revel this season, plus an update on defensive tackle Kenny Clark, who suffered an elbow injury on Sunday.\nOvershown is working his way back from his second major knee injury after tearing his ACL in the 2023 preseason as a rookie. He's ahead of schedule in his rehab after saying during organized team activities that his target return date was Thanksgiving. Schottenheimer said he's been impressed by Overshown's growth on the mental side during his recovery.\n\"I think how much he's been around [defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus] 'Flus and how he sits right in front of the meetings. As I've been sitting in the [defensive] meetings, he sits right in front, and he's got sunglasses on, which is kind of cool. I can't pull that off. I try,\" Schottenheimer said.\"He's intent. You hear him wanting to answer all the questions when they're asking another guy. You see him kind of mouthing the answer. I think it's the understanding of he knows the physical part is going to take care of itself, but mentally and understanding the system and the calls: closed left, rock logs and all the different things that we do. The checks have to make versus certain formations, man, he's all into that. So I think as you mature as a player you understand that it's not just the movement skills and the ability to tackle and run guys down. It's the mental side. It's a chess match, and I think he's gotten older and wiser. I think he's really attacking the play.\"\nClark suffered an elbow injury on a three-yard touchdown run by Commanders running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. with 2:39 left in the third quarter. He was officially listed as questionable but returned with 11:13 remaining in the fourth. Clark generated five quarterback pressures on Sunday, tying his 2025 season high. His 23 pressures lead the Cowboys this year.\n\"I think he's going to be good,\" Schottenheimer said of Clark. \"He's tough as nails, and I thought he did a really good job yesterday affecting the quarterback from a pass-rush standpoint too. The push that he and Osa [Odighizuwa] got in the middle was good to see.\"\nEven after Dallas' best defensive outing of the year against Washington, the Cowboys still rank last in the NFL in pass defense, allowing 260.3 yards per game. Getting Revel back can only help Eberflus' maligned secondary.\"You've just seen it over the last couple of weeks working with [director of rehab] Britt [Brown] -- you've seen the confidence and the change of direction in the things that he's doing, which now makes us very comfortable opening his window and letting him go out there and play football, which he loves to do,\" Schottenheimer said. \"Again, it'll be mostly scout-team stuff probably this week. Let him run around and chase CeeDee and George and those guys around, see how he does. He's going to make mistakes, but I'm pretty sure that he's really, really good at football too. ... I'm proud of him.\"\nDallas has been eager to get its third-round pick on the field given the attrition at cornerback this season, especially with Pro Bowl corner Trevon Diggs having suffered a concussion. There's plenty of excitement around the building for when Revel finally suits up.\"The size [6-foot-1, 194 pounds] and the athleticism jumped off the film in college. I think that, again, he has the traits that we love in corners: they have length, they have competitive spirit, things like that,\" Schottenheimer said. \"I don't want to go too far over the top in my praise for Von because it's going to be a little bit of a process. I'm excited to get him out there on the grass, running around and chasing around some pretty good receivers.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        BIRMINGHAM, Alabama – Jimbo Fisher, who won a national championship at Florida State in 2013, still believes Mike Norvell is a good coach amidst a four-game losing streak that has cranked up the hot seat talk in Tallahassee.Florida State athletic director Michael Alford issued a vote of confidence in Norvell on Monday morning, saying \"we are fully committed to helping Coach Norvell and the 2025 Seminoles strongly rebound in the coming weeks.\" Alford said a \"comprehensive assessment\" of the program would be conducted at the conclusion of the season. That came off as an attempt to tamp down the considerable smoke Sunday that Norvell's job security could be in question after a 20-13 loss to Stanford as influential boosters expressed displeasure with the program's current trajectory. CBS Sports previously reported Norvell even addressed during a Sunday staff meeting that conversations about his future were happening. \n        \n            \n                Why did Florida State decide against firing Mike Norvell? Examining pros, cons as 'Noles back struggling coach\n                \n                    Chip Patterson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFisher, who was speaking at Birmingham's Monday Morning Quarterback Club, was asked to assess what is wrong with the Florida State program that he led from 2010-17. \n\"It's easy to point fingers when you're outside or try to assess things but until you're inside you never really know because there are so many things that can affect how young men play, what goes on with coaches,\" Fisher said. \"Sometimes you have a couple bad breaks and things don't go right, a few technical things, and all of a sudden your confidence goes. \"When those losing streaks happen, those coaches are still good coaches. Mike Norvell has had an undefeated season, he's coached great wherever he's been, those players have won. They beat Alabama in a great game so it's not like they can't play. But it's funny in sports how quickly it can turn from just a little bit of confidence, just a break here and there and your psyche. When those things happen, they can snowball the other way just as fast. I still think they have a good team, a good coach and they'll get it right.\"Fisher knows what it's like when the outside noise starts cranking up and fans start calling for your job. He felt it in College Station when he was ultimately fired after a 45-25 record in six seasons. Similar in some ways to the Norvell situation at Florida State, Fisher was at one point viewed as unfirable because of a massive buyout of more than $70 million. Norvell would be owed more than $55 million if FSU fired him this week. \nEventually, the booster unrest and disappointing results pushed A&M to make a move on Fisher in what is still the largest buyout in college sports history. If FSU ultimately moves on from Norvell, it'd slot in at No. 2 all-time, just ahead of Penn State's recent $49 million buyout of James Franklin. Fanbase disappointment can be impossible to avoid, though Fisher said he always stayed off social media as a coach. When it gets particularly loud, he says, that's when you have to rely on your self-belief and make sure you aren't letting the criticism impact you. That's a lot easier said than done, though, and Fisher believes it can be especially hard for the players. \"In today's time, they grew up on social media,\" Fisher said. \"That's how a lot of their own self-worth is measured by what other people think of them. Hopefully these are hard lessons to learn but maybe they can see now not everyone is for you. They are for you when you're doing well but when it's not, they are just as harsh on you. It can be brutal.\"\nFisher is now working as a television analyst for the ACC Network. He last coached in 2023 but is itching to lead a program again soon. He said Monday he hoped to be on a sideline next season and missed everything from recruiting to practices. In what is already a hectic coaching cycle that features seven Power Four jobs open already, Fisher is expected to be in the mix. His time at Texas A&M ended in disappointment, though he still has a resume that includes a national championship, three ACC championships and five top-10 finishes. \"I want to coach somewhere that's committed to winning,\" the former FSU coach said. \"Just make sure they give us the resources to be able to win. I know it's about money, but you've got to have the resources to put into the game to win and do it the right way. The grass is just as green everywhere.\"\n            ",

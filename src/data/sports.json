However, they did suffer yet another significant loss. Late in the fourth quarter, first-round pick defensive end Mykel Williams went down with a right knee injury. Afterwards, coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters that they fear Williams injured his ACL. A torn ACL would sideline Williams for the remainder of the season.Williams entered Sunday with 19 tackles, one sack, four tackles for loss and two QB hits in eight games played. This is just the latest hit to a banged-up team that has had to deal with more than its fair share of injuries. San Francisco has already lost its two best defensive starters -- Nick Bosa tore his ACL in Week 3 and linebacker Fred Warner suffered a nasty ankle injury in Week 6. The 49ers also have two other defensive linemen on injured reserve in Yetur Gross-Matos and Tarron Jackson. \nEven the defensive linemen not on injured reserve are injured. Bryce Huff missed Sunday's matchup with a hamstring issue, while Sam Okuayinonu (ankle) and Jordan Elliott (ankle) suited up despite being listed as questionable. Alfred Collins (shoulder) and Kalia Davis (hand) were also listed on the injury report this week.San Francisco has faced the same kind of adversity on the offensive side of the ball, as starting quarterback Brock Purdy has played in just two games this season due to a turf toe injury, tight end George Kittle suffered a hamstring injury in Week 1 that landed him on short-term injured reserve, wide receivers Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall have both missed time this season due to injuries, while Brandon Aiyuk is still not ready to suit up after tearing his ACL last October.\nDespite the incredible amount of injuries, the 49ers are off to their second 6-3 start in the last three seasons. Players on both sides of the ball have stepped up, from Mac Jones at quarterback to Tatum Bethune at linebacker. Still, one has to wonder how long the 49ers can continue to win games when it's \"next man up\" every single week. Especially when it comes to the defensive side of the ball. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Cam Little is now in the NFL record book after drilling the longest field goal in NFL history. The Jaguars' kicker booted a 68-yard kick just before halftime during Jacksonville's eventual 30-29 overtime win over the Raiders. Little, who made a 70-yard field goal during the preseason, was mobbed by his teammates after breaking the record previously held by Justin Tucker, who made a 66-yard kick back in 2021.    \nA 2024 sixth-round pick, Little's previous career long was a 59-yard field goal against the Lions during the 2024 season. He had made just one of his three attempts of beyond 50 yards this season prior to his history-making kick.    Little is now just one of three kickers in NFL history to make a field goal of at least 65 yards -- not bad for a 22-year-old who had made just 71.4% of his field goal attempts during the first seven games of the season. \n🏈 Longest FG in NFL history YearPlayerYards2025Cam Little682021Justin Tucker662025Chase McLaughlin652024Brandon Aubrey652025Brandon Aubrey 642013Matt Prater642024Joey Slye 632019Brett Maher 632018Graham Gano632012David Akers632011Sebastian Janikowski631998Jason Elam631970Tom Dempsey63New record-holder Little is the latest kicker hold the NFL record for the longest field goal of all-time. Prior to Little, Tucker broke the record that was previously held by former Broncos kicker Matt Prater, who held the title for eight years after making a 64-yard field goal during the 2013 season. Ironically, he broke the previous mark that was co-held by fellow Bronco Jason Elam, who booted a 63-yard field goal during the 1998 season for the Super Bowl champions. Before Elam's kick, former Saints kicker Tom Dempsey had the record to himself for 28 years. Dempsey, who was born without toes on his right foot, made a 63-yard field goal during the final seconds of the Saints' 19-17 win over the Lions on Nov. 8, 1970. \nWhile his record has since been broken, Dempsey still has the distinction of being the only kicker in history to make a field goal that was attempted inside his team's own 40-yard-line. Back then, the goal posts were still stationed in front of the end zone, which meant that Dempsey's field goal was attempted from the Saints' 37-yard-line. The NFL moved the goalposts back to the end back the end zone ahead of the 1974 season. \nWhat about Brandon Aubrey?Cowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey booted a 65-yard field goal during the 2024 season and also kicked a 64-yarder earlier this season. He has seemingly been on a collision course with the record, with talk before last week's game at Denver in altitude that the Cowboys may give Aubrey a chance at it. \n\"His makes have been at 71, 72 distance carry,\" holder/punter Bryan Anger told CBS Sports. \"I think that it's there just doing the same thing that he's been doing and not trying [purposefully] at a longer distance because they are traveling longer.\"  Aubrey did not get such a chance at Mile High. A week earlier, Dallas actually had a chance to let Aubrey attempt a 67-yarder during a win over Washington. Facing fourth-and-11 from the Commanders' 49-yard line with a 34-15 lead and 6:57 remaining, coach Brian Schottenheimer chose to punt. Of course, that record would have been eclipsed Sunday by Little, anyway. What about the postseason?Oddly, there has never been a 60-yard field goal in the postseason. The longest field goal in playoff history is 58 yards, a record which is held by Pete Stoyanovich and Graham Gano. Stoyanovich made his kick as a member of the Dolphins during a playoff game against the Chiefs in January of 1991. Gano tied his record in January of 2018 as a member of the Panthers. \nCurrent Chiefs Harrison Butker holds the record for the longest field goal in Super Bowl history. Butker made a 57-yard field goal during Kansas City's 25-22 win over the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. He broke the previous record that was held by former Bills kicker Steve Christie, who booted a 54-yard field goal during Super Bowl XXVIII, which was Buffalo's fourth consecutive loss in the big game. \n            ",

Meanwhile, the Seahawks will be fresh coming out of a Week 8 bye, last facing the Houston Texans in a 27-19 victory. Terry McLaurin (quad) has been ruled out for Washington.Kickoff from Northwest Stadium in Landover, Md., is set for 8:20 p.m. ET.

It looked like he may have fumbled at the end of the play, so the Bengals coach threw the red challenge flag in hopes the officials would rule a fumble out of the end zone, which would result in a touchback and give possession to Cincinnati.But not only did the Bengals lose this challenge, but the officials determined that Moore actually crossed the goal line, and awarded a touchdown to the Bears.Check out the play, here:\nThis touchdown extended Chicago's lead to 14 points with under five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, bu that was just the start of the madness as there were three touchdowns that followed in one of the wildest finishes of the season. The Bengals actually scored back-to-back touchdowns thanks to a successful onside kick to acquire a one-point lead with under one minute to play, but the Bears then went 72 yards on four plays, and Caleb Williams hit Colston Loveland for a 58-yard game-winning touchdown.\nIt was a brutal loss for a flailing Bengals team, which just fell to third place in the AFC North with a 3-6 record.\n            \n    ",

That first year was one MLB-wide honor at each position. In 1958, Gold Gloves were split into AL and NL. Also, it used to be three outfielders per league regardless of exact position. Now the outfield spots are broken down into left field, center field, and right field.        Winners are determined through manager/coach voting (75%) and a statistical component (25%). Team  employees can not vote for their own players.         While MLB  released \"finalists\" for the award a few weeks back, remember that the  voting was already complete and the finalists are simply the top three vote-getters at each position. This means, obviously, postseason  performance had no impact.         \nHere are this year's Gold Glove winners.

Just a small bump in the road to a beautiful journey back to playing the game that I love!! Much love\"\n\nRaiola, a five-star quarterback from the 2024 recruiting cycle in the 247Sports rankings, was the key to a 6-2 start to the season for Nebraska. In Nebraska's first loss of the season, a close 30-27 defeat against Michigan, Raoila kept the Huskers in the game with 308 passing yards and three touchdowns through the air.At the time of Nebraska's loss to Michigan, the Wolverines were ranked No. 21 in the AP Poll. USC entered Saturday's game ranked No. 23. Those losses ran Nebraska's losing skid against AP-ranked teams to 29, a skid that dates back to 2016.\nCoach Matt Rhule stated after the loss to USC that Raiola wanted to go back in the game, but the quarterback was unable to run.\"I love you too much to ask you to play when you're hurt like this,\" Rhule told the media after the game of his conversation with his quarterback.Coming into the weekend, Raiola had thrown for 1,909 yards and 17 touchdowns to just six interceptions. He has thrown at least one touchdown pass in eight of Nebraska's nine games this season.\nTrue freshman TJ Lateef came into the game following Raiola's injury, completing five of seven passes for just seven yards. Lateef, who will remain under center for Nebraska, also rushed for 18 yards on seven carries.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A few weeks after Auburn athletics director John Cohen compared Hugh Freeze's job to an unreliable car that he wasn't sure would start, the inevitable happened -- the Tigers fired Freeze. Ironically, Freeze's Auburn tenure actually ended as a slow-moving accident. Punt after punt after punt defined the Tigers' 10-3 home loss to Kentucky, the first time in 28 years the Tigers allowed 10 or fewer points and lost a game. The defeat dropped Freeze to 15-19 overall on The Plains. He ended his tenure 1-11 against ranked teams despite a top-13 roster in the sport, per the 247Sports Team Talent Composite. Unlike big-name coaches James Franklin and Brian Kelly who were fired earlier in the 2025 coaching carousel, there was no real argument to be made in favor of keeping Freeze. His reputation as an offensive wiz is in the tank; the Tigers rank No. 118 in yards per play despite a talented offensive line, elite wide receivers and a hand-picked transfer portal QB, Jackson Arnold, who had a seven-figure price tag (Freeze seemed to always pick the wrong portal QB, ignoring Cam Ward when he entered the transfer portal from Washington State). Auburn's coaching search promises to be a blockbuster with a heavy-handed booster class that loves to meddle. The Tigers need to nail the hire in an SEC that's getting more competitive by the week, it seems. \nAs for Freeze?The 56-year-old is a controversial college football figure whose long track record of success feels more distant with each blunder he makes (coaches across the country still cannot figure out why Freeze refused to reevaluate a collaborative play-calling approach). Be skeptical there's much of a market for Freeze as a head coach moving forward -- and it's also unclear if Freeze will want to coach again any time soon. Freeze was diagnosed with prostate cancer in February and is currently undergoing treatment. Doctors caught it early and he opted against immediate surgery to have the mass removed. That's because the cancer was deemed low aggressive, per Freeze. He said back in the summer he planned to reevaluate his health in January. \nThere was likely going to be industry speculation this season Freeze might step down from Auburn because of his health. So, it's reasonable to think Freeze may take some time off and focus on his recovery. He certainly doesn't mind having the time to play golf. As for a potential future in coaching, maybe Freeze could emerge as a candidate at a Group of Five program. He found outsized success in past stints at Arkansas State and Liberty. But checking with industry sources, it's hard to see Freeze making an immediate return as a Power Four head coach. He won't have the cachet of Franklin or a Kelly, and his baggage is immense. If Freeze desired it, he could likely grab a play-caller job somewhere or stash himself away on a staff as an analyst. \nFreeze benefits from the flexibility of an around $15 million buyout without a 'duty to mitigate' clause, which compels those like Franklin to find work right away to offset their buyout. It seems unlikely Freeze wants to fade away forever into the background -- he only took a year-long sabbatical after his Ole Miss tenure ended in a blaze of destruction -- but his chance at reaching the peaks of his Ole Miss tenure are shot. People tend to notice when a luxury car won't start. \n    \n                                        \n    The Auburn Tigers are searching for their next head football coach following the dismissal of Hugh Freeze.

    "body": "\n        Racing Louisville are playoff-bound for the first time in their history, booking the final spot in the postseason as the NWSL regular season came to an entertaining close.Louisville's 1-0 win over Bay FC took them two points clear of the North Carolina Courage, who were in the hunt for a postseason berth but their 3-2 win over Gotham FC was not enough to get them over the line. The combination of results also sent Gotham from seventh place at the start of Decision Day to eighth place, leaving them with one win in their last seven and ensuring they will meet the in-form Kansas City Current in the quarterfinals.The Portland Thorns, meanwhile, made the greatest gains on Sunday by rising from sixth to third with a 2-0 win over the Houston Dash and booking a home playoff game in the process. Deyna Castellanos and Jessie Fleming bagged both goals, winning three in their last four en route to the playoffs and setting up a meeting with the San Diego Wave in the quarterfinals.Here are the takeaways from NWSL Decision Day and what Sunday's results might mean for the playoffs.NWSL Decision Day resultsKansas City Current 2, San Diego Wave 1North Carolina Courage 3, Gotham FC 2Utah Royals 1, Washington Spirit 0Orlando Pride 1, Seattle Reign 1Racing Louisville 1, Bay FC 0Chicago Stars 2, Angel City 1Portland Thorns 2, Houston Dash 0NWSL Playoffs quarterfinal matchupsMatches to take place during the weekend of Nov. 7 to 9; schedule TBA\nKansas City Current vs. Gotham FCWashington Spirit vs. Racing LouisvillePortland Thorns vs. San Diego WaveOrlando Pride vs. Seattle ReignLouisville book first-ever playoff berthRacing Louisville booked the last remaining playoff spot with a 1-0 win over Bay FC on Sunday, enough to finish two points above the North Carolina Courage and pip the two-time NWSL champions for their first-ever trip to the postseason. The game's lone goal came courtesy of Ella Hase in the 48th minute, the rookie scoring her first professional goal on a day where Louisville's dominant performance met the moment during a must-win game. Their ability to reach the postseason is a testament to their steady improvement under head coach Bev Yanez, now in her second year in the job, though the road does not get easier from here – they will take on a Washington Spirit team that cruised to second place, though an injury crisis could make a run to the Championship trickier than they would like.\nCurrent re-establish championship credentialsThe Kansas City Current may have been without the injured Temwa Chawinga but they fared just fine without her on Sunday, notching a 2-1 win over the San Diego Wave for one final win of the regular season. The Wave did open the scoring with a goal from Dudinha in the eighth minute but the Current's depth stole the show, first with Debinha's 54th-minute equalizer and Nichelle Prince's go-ahead goal 20 minutes later. Debinha is a mainstay in the Current's lineup, as are fellow starter Bia Zaneratto and a healthy Chawinga, the three of them enough to mount a title challenge. That merely scratches the surface on the Current's attack, though – rising U.S. women's national team stars Michelle Cooper and Ally Senator started on Sunday and add another dimension to their offense, while Prince's contribution off the bench shows head coach Vlatko Andonovski has no shortage of options as they begin to mount a deep playoff run.\nGotham's skid continuesThe most tantalizing matchup in the quarterfinals will see Gotham face the Current in Kansas City, but what version of Gotham shows up a week from now is the biggest question as the NWSL pivots from the regular season to the postseason. They were already assured of a playoff spot before Decision Day but the Courage carved up their defense in a 3-2 win, an uncharacteristic showing for a Gotham side that is usually anchored by defensive resolve. There is perhaps an argument to be made that conceding two-plus expected goals and three actual goals is an anomaly but Gotham could not muster one expected goal from 14 shots by the 86th minute, their late goals flattering their performance. They have been overly reliant on Spain international Esther Gonzalez, who has scored nearly 40% of the team's goals this season but was unavailable on Sunday, and enter the postseason with just one win in their last seven. Gotham are the exact type of team that can turn things around in the span of a week, boasting a mix of NWSL winners and players with international titles on their roster, but their eighth place regular season finish signals that there is plenty of room for improvement.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Another Sunday, another full slate of NFL action nearly in the books. And Week 9 delivered lots of drama, that's for sure.Joe Flacco unleashed another high-scoring attack for the Cincinnati Bengals, only for the AFC North squad's porous defense to steal the thunder (for the wrong reasons) once again. J.J. McCarthy returned under center for the Minnesota Vikings and didn't get swallowed up by the rival Detroit Lions on the road; quite the opposite, in fact.Meanwhile, across the NFC North, the Green Bay Packers went cold and suffered a stunning defeat. The Indianapolis Colts' magical run in the AFC came to a halt against the suddenly stout Pittsburgh Steelers. And the Denver Broncos survived the Houston Texans, who lost starting quarterback C.J. Stroud due to injury.Basically, all the fireworks went off for the bulk of Week 9's schedule, and it resulted in some surprising names serving as both victorious heroes and culprits of defeat. So which players, coaches and teams stood out the most, for better and worse?\n\n        \n            \n                A Bengals challenge results in a Bears touchdown leading to one of the wildest finishes of the season\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHere are some of Sunday's biggest winners and losers across the league: Winner: J.J. McCarthyThe Vikings seemed destined to get steamrolled Sunday, with Carson Wentz all but driven into the ground (and onto injured reserve), both units sapped of full health and energy, and McCarthy returning for just his third career NFL game in Detroit. Instead, the youngster injected much-needed life into Kevin O'Connell's club on the road, shaking off five sacks and scoring three touchdowns to upset the Lions. The best part? Just like way back in Week 1, he saved some of his most confident stuff for late.Loser: Zac TaylorTaylor isn't directly in charge of the Bengals' defense, but how can you not face intense scrutiny when you're the head coach of a team that's now given up 500+ yards in three games this year, and lost back-to-back contests in which your emergency quarterback, Joe Flacco, helped put 38+ points on the board? This is now two years running where even Joe Burrow's availability -- or any kind of prolific points-scoring -- means almost nothing, because the \"D\" is so consistently soft and/or devoid of talent.Winner: Matthew StaffordAnother day, another multi-score showing from the ageless Los Angeles Rams gunslinger, who at 37 remains the club's sturdiest playmaker of the 2025 season. Yes, he was matched up with the lowly New Orleans Saints on Sunday, facing little to no competition from a team starting a rookie signal-caller in Tyler Shough. But even with Puka Nacua exiting due to another injury, Stafford was lights out, tossing four scores, including two to Davante Adams, to quietly vault the Rams to 6-2 on the year.\nLoser: Patrick MahomesNot a lot went No. 15's way at Highmark Stadium. We all know the Kansas City Chiefs star has the Buffalo Bills' number when it counts; he's a perfect 4-0 against Josh Allen and Co. in the playoffs. But Sunday was a different story as Allen led a fifth straight regular-season victory over K.C. Sean McDermott's defensive front hit Mahomes more than a dozen times, sacking him thrice, and the secondary did its part, too, with Maxwell Hairston snagging a game-sealing pick. In a surprise twist, Mahomes was also dinged by the officials thanks to a wrongful intentional grounding call, which might've been overturned if it were technically reviewable.Winner: Mike TomlinA week ago, Tomlin looked out of his league trying to squeeze results from an aging secondary at the close of a decisive defeat at the hands of the Packers. His inability to find answers spoiled an otherwise valiant effort from Aaron Rodgers. A week later, Tomlin's unit reversed its fortunes, with T.J. Watt, Alex Highsmith and the Steel City pass rush totally engulfing Daniel Jones, who endured five sacks and five turnovers in easily his roughest outing as the Colts' signal-caller. Pittsburgh hasn't quite lost its edge just yet.Loser: Jordan LoveJust as Tomlin's Steelers rediscovered their grit, the man who shredded them in Week 8 went the other direction on Sunday. Love's calling card is uncorking one of the NFL's prettiest deep balls, but he slung it upwards for the sake of slinging it against the Carolina Panthers, seemingly \"chasing the big play,\" as Packers coach Matt LaFleur later put it. As a result, the Panthers had an easy pick against the star quarterback and could've easily had another, riding another big day from Rico Dowdle to a surprise 16-13 upset.\nWinner: Ben JohnsonThe Bengals deserve all the heat they're already getting over their inability to, say, wrap up on a single tackle after their wild loss to Chicago. But the Bears' head man also deserves some credit for scheming up the attack that broke Al Golden's defense. Caleb Williams caught not one but two critical passes on trick plays dialed up by Johnson, and the creative designs also sprung loose a pair of surprise young standouts in Kyle Monangai (176 rushing yards) and Colston Loveland (six catches, 118 yards).\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Going into Week 9, the most talked about field goal of the 2025 NFL season didn't even happen during the season, it happened during the preseason. Back in August, Cam Little hit the longest field goal in football history when he drilled a 70-yarder for the Jacksonville Jaguars. That was the first sign that something might be different with kickers this year.  The second sign came in September when Tampa Bay's Chase McLaughlin hit the longest OUTDOOR field goal in NFL history with a 65-yarder during a 31-25 loss to the Eagles in Week 4. Going into the game, McLaughlin's career long was 57 yards, but he was 0-for-2 on his only two career attempts longer than that. Against the Eagles, though, something was different: He topped his career-long TWICE in the same game with a 58-yarder and his record-setting 65-yarder.  \nThe Eagles got the win in that game and could have started preparing for Week 5, but in a press conference held TWO DAYS after their victory, the only thing Vic Fangio wanted to talk about was McLaughlin's kicks. The Eagles defensive coordinator insisted that the only reason McLaughlin was able to hit the kicks is because he was benefiting from a new K-Ball rule that was implemented just this year.  \"These kicking balls that they changed this year have drastically changed the kicking game, field goals in particular,\" Fangio said. \"So it's almost like they need an asterisk here. It was the live ball era or the asterisk for those home runs [Former MLB player Barry] Bonds and [Former MLB player Sammy] Sosa and [Former MLB player Mark] McGwire were hitting. The way they've changed the ball. The NFL, the kicking ball has drastically changed the field goals.\" \nFangio might be on to something, because in Week 9, Little actually set the NFL record for longest field goal when he drilled a 68-yard kick in a 30-29 overtime win over the Las Vegas Raiders.  \nLittle's kick broke a record that had been held by Justin Tucker, who hit a 66-yarder in 2021. There have only been six field goals of 64 yards or longer in NFL history and THREE of them have come this year. So why are we seeing all of these long field goals? Based what on what several NFL kickers have had to say, it all comes down to a rule change that was made this year. \nFrom 1970 through 2006, a period of 36 years, there were only six total field goals of 60 yards or more. This year, there have been SEVEN field goals of more than 60 yards through the first nine weeks alone. This marks the first year in NFL history where there have been more than four field goals of 60 yards or more through the first nine weeks.  It's not just 60 yarders, though, it's pretty much all long range kicks: There have been 35 field goals of at least 55 yards so far this year, which is the most ever through seven weeks. As recently as 2021, kickers didn't even hit 35 field goals from that distance during the ENTIRE season. Back in 2024, there were 26 field goals of at least 55 yards through seven weeks, which was the previous record.  Year \t\t\t\tNumber of 55+ yard field goals through 9 weeks \t\t\t\tNumber of 60+ yard field goals through 9 weeks \t\t\t\t2025 \t\t\t\t3972024 \t\t\t\t3042023 \t\t\t\t2842022 \t\t\t\t232 \t\t\t\t2021 \t\t\t\t152 \t\t\t\t2020 \t\t\t\t160 \t\t\t\t2019 \t\t\t\t102 \t\t\t\tThe proof is in the numbers: Kickers are hitting long field goals at a higher rate this season and one big reason why that appears to be happening is because of a new K-Ball rule that was implemented this year.  Under the new rule, each team is given 60 kicking footballs (K-Balls) at the beginning of the season. This allows each team to break the ball in before they use it. Since the ball can be used in practice, that generally softens it up. Teams are also allowed to use a brush to try and rub down the bumps (Every football is covered by thousands of tiny bumps). The team has to give three K-Balls to the officiating crew before each game and then the officials have to approve each ball for use. Once a ball is approved, it gets a special mark from the referee and each K-Ball can only be used for three games before being retired.  Under the old rule that existed from 1999 until 2024, teams were given three brand new footballs ON GAME DAY and they had roughly one hour to break them in. The new balls were stiff, which made them more difficult to kick. It was the difference between using a brand new baseball glove and a worn in glove. So are kickers now able to hit longer field goals thanks to the new rule? Just ask San Francisco 49ers kicker Eddy Pineiro about that. \"Does it help with distance? Absolutely,\" Pineiro said of the new rule. Pineiro predicted back in September that there would be more long distance kicks this year and his prediction turned out to be 100% correct. \"One big difference [with the new rule] is that you can use the ball that you practice with in the games, which a lot of people don't know that. That helps a lot,\" Pineiro told KNBR after Week 3. \"That's going to help a lot with distance. You're going to see a lot of 60-plus yarders this year with some more broken in balls. If you don't have a broken in ball, it's a lot harder to hit a 60-plus yard field goal. The ball won't travel as far.\"If anyone should know how much the new rule can help, it's definitely Pineiro. Under the old K-Ball rule, the longest field goal of Pineiro's career was 56 yards, but under the new rule, he's already topped that. Back in Week 5, he hit a key 59-yard field goal for the 49ers in a 26-23 win over the Rams. \nJust two years ago, Pineiro fell about five yards short on a 59-yard attempt. This year, not only is he 17 of 17 on the season, but he's a perfect 5 of 5 from 50 yards and longer. Cincinnati Bengals kicker Evan McPherson also thinks the new rule has helped. \"I think it definitely makes a little bit of a difference,\" McPherson told CBS Sports earlier this month. \"The leather is a little bit softer, I think the ball compresses a little bit more.\"The difference between a stiff ball and a softer ball can make all the difference in the world when it comes to how far back a kicker can attempt a field goal from. \"Yea, if you can get a really good, broken in ball, it can add five to 10 yards,\" McPherson said. \"If you can compress the ball, it will go a lot further and so I feel like that's what we're seeing: The balls are softer, more springy and people are being able to compress it really well and not really have to try to hit these long field goals.\"The NFL seems to be aware that a well broken in ball can add \"five to 10 yards,\" which is one likely reason why the league is requiring that each K-Ball gets taken out of commission after three games. But even with that requirement in place, the long kicks are still coming. McPherson almost had the biggest field goal of the NFL season back in Week 6 when he drilled what would have been an NFL record at the time: A 67-yard kick against Green Bay. However, the kick didn't count because Packers coach Matt LaFleur called a timeout just before the snap. \nThat's a kick the Bengals probably don't try under the old rule, a rule that was in place for the first four seasons of McPherson's career. \"From playing with the K-ball rule for the first four years and then playing with [the new rule] this year, I'd say I have noticed a difference and maybe it's just that you get confidence from using the ball and seeing it throughout the week,\" the Bengals kicker said. Now that teams get the K-Balls in their hands at the beginning of the season, it allows them to brush away the bumps on the ball. A smoother ball allows the kicker to make better contact, which leads to better kicks. \"We tried to work out all the little knobs on the football and try to get it pretty smooth and we try to break it as best we can, but the leather, in years past, was a lot stiffer,\" McPherson said. \"The balls would still fly pretty well in years past, but for whatever reason, just being able to kick them throughout the week and then break them in and actually take our time with it, it's been a big plus.\"Of course, the new rule isn't the only reason we're seeing so many long distance kicks. The best kicker in the NFL right now is Brandon Aubrey and he's coached in Dallas by Nick Sorensen, the special teams coordinator for the Cowboys. Although Sorensen thinks the new rule might be having an impact on why we're seeing long kicks, he also believes that kickers have just improved over time. \"I think the kickers are just better and better and better every year,\" Sorensen said recently. \"The K-Ball may have some degree, but I think it's more the comfort with the ball because it's broken in. I don't know if the ball would travel further. I feel like every year you've got these kids their legs are just so much stronger.\"That's an assessment that Pineiro agrees with. \"The game's evolving, kickers are getting better,\" Pineiro said. \"There's more kicking coaches now, there's more technique stuff that you can do to better your kicking that we didn't have in the past.\"If kickers are evolving, Aubrey is the pinnacle of that evolution. The former MLS draft pick has taken over the NFL. Of the six field goals that have been hit this year from 60 yards or longer, Aubrey has two of them. He also hit a 65-yarder last year, which is tied with McLaughlin for the second-longest field goal in NFL history. Overall, he's hit five field goals of at least 60 yards, which is the most by any kicker in NFL history. \nLittle's leg is as strong as Aubrey's, but he doesn't have quite the accuracy. The Jaguars kicker has hit just 76.5% of his field goals this season after going 3 of 3 against the Raiders on Sunday. Despite the struggles, Little has shown that he has a booming leg and like Aubrey, he's a weapon that who puts his team in field goal range as soon as they hit midfield (The Jaguars literally snapped the ball from midfield on Little's record-setting kick). Although Little has the record now, he might not hold it for long.  \"The guy in Dallas is going to hit a 70-plus yarder this year. You can just book it,\" Fangio said. \nLittle hit a 70-yarder in the preseason and it won't be surprising if someone soon pulls that off in a regular-season game. Thanks to a simple rule change, Aubrey, Little and a few other kickers can now hit field goals from ranges that were once considered impossible.\n            ",

The Blue Devils are off to a 2-0 start to the season after picking up wins over Texas and Western Carolina, while Army is coming off an 83-76 loss to St. Thomas (Minnesota). This game will be the ultimate crossover for former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. He graduated from West Point and began his head coaching career with Army before taking the job with the Blue Devils in 1980. Krzyzewski will be recognized prior to tipoff.The Blue Devils are entering a new era after reigning CBS Sports National Player of the Year Cooper Flagg departed to the NBA. Duke is led by star freshman Cameron Boozer, who is a projected top-three pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. He is coming off his best performance of the season after posting 25 points in a blowout win over Western Carolina. Army is led by Kevin McCarthy and Jackson Furman, who both enter this matchup averaging 16 points per game. McCarthy scored a team-high 18 points during the Black Knights' 73-49 win over SUNY-Maritime. Here is everything you need to know ahead of Duke's matchup with Army on Tuesday. \n Where to watch Duke vs. Army  live  Date: Tuesday, Nov. 11 | Time: 7 p.m. ET   Location: Christl Arena -- West Point, New York \tTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder]  Live stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App Duke vs. Army: Need to knowDuke's starting lineup has been as expected: Heading into the season, there were four spots in the Blue Devils' starting lineup accounted for: Isaiah Evans, Cameron Boozer, Dame Sarr, and Patrick Ngongba II. However, the final spot (point guard) was up for grabs between junior Caleb Foster and incoming freshman Cayden Boozer -- the brother of Cameron. Ultimately, Foster won the job and has been in the starting lineup in each of the first two games. Foster was part of Duke's star-studded 2023 recruiting class, and his role has fluctuated throughout his time in Durham. With a more steady role in place, Foster is someone to keep an eye on to steady the ship after Tyrese Proctor played that role last season.Army vs. Duke is a rare matchup: In the past 40 years, only one current Power Five program has traveled to West Point to face Army: Duke. The Blue Devils won that matchup 78-45 against Army on Nov. 16, 1997. Almost 28 years later, Duke will return to West Point for a fun nonconference showdown. In true nonconference road games, Duke is 3-3 over the last 10 years. Army is looking to pull off a huge upset. The Black Knights are 2-43 all-time against ranked opponents and have lost their previous 24 games over that span. The last win against a ranked team came in 1977, when Army defeated Kansas State.Duke's top-ranked recruiting class is headlined by the potential No. 1 pick: Since taking over for Coach K, Duke coach Jon Scheyer has done an excellent job on the recruiting trail. The Blue Devils landed the No. 1-ranked class last year, headlined by former No. 1 overall pick Cooper Flagg, and once again have a top-tier class. Duke finished as the No. 1-ranked recruiting class again this past cycle -- which included landing Boozer -- the No. 3 overall prospect in the cycle. Also in that class were Sarr, Boozer's brother Cayden, five-star Nikolas Khamenia and four-star Sebastian Wilkins. Sarr was a late add to Duke's recruiting class after Cedric Coward elected to stay in the 2025 NBA Draft instead of transferring to Duke. Coward went on to become a lottery pick and has been one of the top rookies so far.Duke vs. Army prediction, picks Odds via FanDuel SportsbookDuke looked strong during the second half of its win over Texas last week. The Blue Devils should be able to cruise to a victory behind the play of Boozer, who looks like a legit candidate for National Player of the Year. Boozer's supporting cast (Isaiah Evans, Dame Sarr and Caleb Foster) is also strong. The Blue Devils cover the spread behind a big night from Boozer, who will record his second double-double of the season. Pick: Duke -30.5\nWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.           \n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Alyssa Thomas is the second major signing for the new Project B women's basketball league that will play in the WNBA offseason. Thomas joins Nneka Ogwumike as veteran WNBA All-Stars to sign with the league that will play a global, 11-week schedule in its inaugural season from November 2026 to April 2027. Project B is a Saudi-backed startup league with a long list of high-profile investors, including Candace Parker, that has lofty aspirations and promises players big salaries and equity stakes in the league. It joins Unrivaled, Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart's 3-on-3 league that launched last season, in offering offseason opportunities for WNBA players to play and bring in significant salaries beyond the current overseas options. Former WNBA star Alana Beard is the league's chief basketball officer, and has led the charge in signing Ogwumike and Thomas as the Project B's first major signings. \"Alyssa is the kind of player and person you build around,\" Beard told the AP. \"Her leadership, competitiveness and professionalism elevate everyone around her. As one of the most respected players in the world, she represents the new era of player partnership and global competition that Project B stands for.\"\nThomas played for Unrivaled in their inaugural season and is listed as a participant for the upcoming Unrivaled season, but by joining Project B she will not continue in the 3-on-3 league after this spring as the two leagues will have overlapping schedules. The massive expansion in the women's basketball world comes at a fascinating time for the WNBA, as the league and the WNBPA are in the midst of a contentious CBA negotiation. Among the biggest hangups is players' desire not only for a significant increase in salaries, but a greater piece of the pie when it comes to the league's revenue being guaranteed for players. That has made the business models promised by Project B and Unrivaled so appealing, and the emergence of those leagues as significant opportunities for earnings puts unique pressure on the WNBA in CBA negotiations that few other major sports leagues face with few alternatives. \nThe big question facing Project B is its ability to land WNBA stars in their prime. Ogwumike will be 36 and Thomas will be 34 when the league gets started next November, and Unrivaled has secured commitments from the likes of Paige Bueckers and some of the WNBA's most promising young stars. A global schedule may be more appealing to older players, but they'll have to prove they are an intriguing option for younger stars in order to fulfill their lofty goals. Given its ties to the Saudi Public Investment Fund and desire to create a global schedule, Project B has garnered comparisons to LIV Golf, which had similar problems early on in landing top young, American talent away from the PGA Tour. The big difference that helps Project B in their recruitment compared to LIV is they don't have to pry players away from the WNBA, but instead convince them to spend their offseasons playing basketball around the world. Some of the biggest names in women's basketball remain uncommitted to an offseason league, namely Caitlin Clark and A'ja Wilson, who would move the needle in a way no one else could for a fledgling league.  \n            ",

    "body": "\nStephen Curry is set to return Tuesday following a three-game absence because of an illness, and the Golden State Warriors hope their star guard is the cure to what ails them when they visit the defending NBA champions Oklahoma City Thunder. Tipoff is set for 8 p.m. ET from the Paycom Center. The matchup will serve as a daunting but accurate litmus test for a Golden State team that started the NBA season 4-1 but has dropped four of its past six. The Warriors have lost their last four contests away from home and are facing a Thunder team that has yet to lose on its home floor. Oklahoma City returns from a four-game road trip in which its lone defeat -- and only loss so far this season -- came to the Portland Trail Blazers 121-119.The Warriors come in on a positive note behind a 114-83 home win over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday but now embark on a road trip that includes back-to-back games against the Spurs, as well as matchups at New Orleans, Orlando and Miami.\"I think it's significant,\" Golden State veteran center Al Horford said. \"I know it's still November, but it's a big challenge for our group and the way to address it, and I know that we will. We'll take it a game at a time and we can't overlook anyone.\" Oklahoma City is a 7.5-point favorite and the over/under for total points scored is 227.5 in the latest NBA sportsbook odds for Warriors vs. Thunder.In addition to the NBA marquee showdown, we'll look at a matchup on the gridiron and a key NHL contest as part of the games to watch for Tuesday, Nov. 11.NBA best bets today, where to watchGolden State Warriors at Oklahoma City Thunder Time: 8 p.m. | Location: Oklahoma City | TV: NBA League Pass | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Thunder -7.5 \nAlthough the return of Curry undoubtedly makes Golden State more dangerous, the SportsLine Projection Model doesn't see the future Hall of Fame sharpshooter making enough of a difference for the Warriors to keep pace with the blistering Thunder. In fact, the model believes the presence of Curry providers a discount on the point spread that can be exploited. Its 10,000-game simulation sees Oklahoma City coming out on top by an average score of 124-109, covering the spread a whopping 68% of the time in the process. It all adds up to an \"A\" grade selection on the Thunder, a rare classification that indicates an extremely strong position. The model also offers a moderate lean on the Over 227.5 points. CFB best bets today, where to watchOhio Bobcats at Western Michigan Broncos Time: 8 p.m. | Location: Kalamazoo, Mich. | TV: ESPN2 Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Ohio +1.5 \nThis Tuesday night MAC showdown might fall under the radar for some college football observers, but hardcore fans will savor this battle of clubs that are both 4-1 in the conference and fighting for supremacy in the top-heavy league. Both teams have won five of their past six. While the Broncos are 1.5-point favorites in this game, the SportsLine Projection Model sees this as a lopsided contest in Ohio's favor. Its 10,000-game simulation forecasts an outright Ohio win and thus a cover around an astounding 71% of the time. These numbers result in another rare \"A\" grade selection for the model on Bobcats money line.NHL best bets today, where to watchColumbus Blue Jackets at Seattle KrakenTime: 10 p.m. | Location: Seattle| TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Expert : Seattle -120 (Matt Severance) The SportsLine Projection Model has a moderate lean on the Blue Jackets, but top NHL SportsLine expert Matt Severance (+543 on the NHL this season) likes it the other way and has released a play on the Kraken. He notes this is the end of a dreadful road trip for Columbus in which it has lost the first four, with three of those defeats coming by one goal. Severance also notes the Kraken have won their past three home contests against the Blue Jackets. \n            ",

Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has stated that this World Cup could be his last when speaking about potential retirement during an interview at the TUTISE tourism forum in Saudi Arabia.\"Sure, it's true because I'll be 41 years old, and I think in this great competition, I don't know ... As I said, I'm enjoying this moment,\" Ronaldo said.He did walk back a bit of when retirement could come, joking that soon could mean as much as 10 years for him, but if this is Ronaldo's final World Cup, it will also be his last chance to win one. He has won the UEFA European Championship with Portugal in 2016 as well as the UEFA Nations League twice in 2019 and 2025, but he has never lifted the World Cup, which is one of the few trophies that he hasn't held in his illustrious career.\nLast week, in an interview with Piers Morgan, Ronaldo also spoke about his World Cup ambitions.\"Winning the World Cup isn't a dream for me. Winning one tournament doesn't prove you're one of the greatest players in history. It's just six or seven matches, that's not fair.\" \nThat doesn't mean that he wouldn't like to win one, especially since Lionel Messi was able to secure his first World Cup title in 2022 with Argentina, and La Albiceleste are among the favorites to win this tournament as well. It's hard to imagine a World Cup without Ronaldo leading the line for Portugal, but it could become a reality sooner than later.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 offseason in Major League Baseball is fully underway, which means we're gradually ticking off the dates on our offseason calendar. That also means a steady supply of rumors, most of which center on free agency and trades (along with the occasional hiring and firing). Speaking of which, you can find Tuesday's supply just below. Tucker a possibility for Dodgers Will the top-rated free agent pair up with the top-rated team this offseason?\nKyle Tucker is available on the market, the Dodgers have a need at the outfielder corners, and they have the resources and competitive will to make it happen. As one of the best all-around players in baseball (when healthy), Tucker seems like an ideal fit in L.A. for 2026 and beyond. However, such a pairing is not to be assumed. The Dodgers have some impressive outfield prospects on the way, and as the Athletic reports they may be inclined to sign a veteran outfielder to a short-term deal to serve as a bridge to those incoming outfield prospects. Possibilities on that front include free agents Harrison Bader and Trent Grisham, or it's possible the Dodgers could revisit trade talks with the Guardians regarding Steven Kwan. Mets would \"love\" to re-sign Alonso, DíazBetween first baseman Pete Alonso and closer Edwin Díaz, the Mets could lose two of the top 15 players on the free-agent market. Yet New York's top baseball operations decision maker isn't ready to rule out a possible return.\n\"We love both Pete and Edwin. They've been great representatives of the organization,\" president of baseball operations David Stearns said Tuesday at the GM meetings. \"We'd love to have them both back. At this stage of the offseason, it's really tough to predict any outcomes, but certainly, we would love to have both those guys back.\"Of the pair, Díaz would seem more likely to re-up with the Mets. Alonso, conversely, was a late re-signing last spring and appears to again be a redundancy given the Mets already employ a surplus of corner infielders, including Mark Vientos, the most logical candidate to take over at the cold corner if and when Alonso departs. Contreras may stick with St. LouisThe Cardinals, in the midst of pivoting toward some level of mid- to long-term rebuild, are likely to explore trade opportunities for the veterans remaining on their roster. The wrinkle is that those three veterans -- third baseman Nolan Arenado, right-hander Sonny Gray, and first baseman/catcher Willson Contreras -- all have no-trade clauses. Arenado is certainly willing to waive his for the right fit and Gray has indicated a willingness to do the same, albeit for perhaps a narrower band of destinations. As for Contreras, he's repeatedly said he wants to remain in St. Louis as he heads into the third year of a five-year, $87.5 million pact. \nAt the end of the 2025 season, he reiterated those desires to new lead decision-maker Chaim Bloom, and the Belleville News-Democrat reports that Contreras still seems inclined to stick with St. Louis. Coming off another productive season, Contreras would probably have a market for his services, especially if he's willing to take on part-time catching duties, but for now he still seems like he wants to remain a Cardinal despite what seem like long odds of contention in 2026. \n            ",

Meanwhile, the Jets have the 28th ranked total offense and will be without receiver Garrett Wilson (knee). However, Wilson's absence should allow other wideouts to emerge for an offense centered around Breece Hall, which could provide NFL DFS sleepers that you can get at a discount of a price.Justin Fields will have to throw it to someone downfield as with New England having the league's No. 1 run defense, through the air may be New York's preferred option to move the ball.

After being held out of the endzone over the first seven games, Hall has three touchdowns, in addition to 272 scrimmage yards, over his last two games. He also has an impressive history versus New England, averaging 120.7 total yards, with two total touchdowns, over his last three matchups with the Patriots. While New England is strong versus the run, it is susceptible to pass-catching RBs, which Hall certainly is, as no team has allowed more catches to running backs in 2025 than the Pats. See who else to roster at SportsLine.Another of McClure's NFL DFS picks is Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson after the rookie went for 150 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns versus what was a top-10 run defense last week with Tampa. He won't see a top-10 run defense on TNF as New York ranks 25th versus the ground game and has allowed 158-plus rushing yards in back-to-back games. Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) has missed the last two games, paving the way for Henderson to see the bulk of touches again, and all but one starting running back this year has had at least 85 yards or a touchdown versus the Jets. See more NFL DFS picks at SportsLine.New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $150 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins. How to set NFL DFS lineups for 'Thursday Night Football'McClure is targeting another undervalued player who could explode for huge numbers on 'Thursday Night Football'.

    "body": "\n        About a week after being cleared to resume football activities, Asante Samuel Jr. is signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers, according to ESPN. The veteran cornerback had recently been cleared for football activities after undergoing spinal fusion surgery in April.  A 2021 second-round pick of the Chargers, Samuel played in just four games last season after experiencing what he described as a stinger in both shoulders. Dr. David Okonkwo, a neurosurgeon for the Steelers, performed Samuel's surgery.Samuel, 26, had two interceptions in each of his first three seasons with the Chargers. In the 2022 AFC wild-card round, Samuel had three interceptions and six pass breakups during Los Angeles' loss to the Jaguars. Overall, Samuel has 176 tackles and six interceptions in 50 career games (47 starts).\nWhat does Asante Samuel Jr. bring to the Steelers?Pittsburgh's decision to sign Samuel makes sense given its recent injuries at the position. Starting cornerback Darius Slay is in the concussion protocol after getting injured during the Week 10 loss to the Chargers. The Steelers, now 5-4, were already thin at cornerback after Jalen Ramsey's recent move to free safety to replace DeShon Elliott, who recently went on injured reserve. \nSamuel will now work alongside Joey Porter Jr. (who had an interception in Pittsburgh's Week 9 win over the Colts), emerging backup Brandin Echols and veteran backup James Pierre. \n        \n            \n                NFL Week 11 Power Rankings: Belichick who?

Dugger received a game ball after playing in all but one of Pittsburgh's defensive snaps against the Colts after signing just days leading up to the game. The Steelers also recently re-signed undrafted rookie Sebastian Castro, who was just waived by the Buccaneers. In a corresponding move, the Steelers released veteran safety and former starter Juan Thornhill. \nOn Sunday, Pittsburgh's defense will have its work cut out for it against the Bengals and quarterback Joe Flacco, who threw for 342 yards and three touchdowns during Cincinnati's 33-31 win over the Steelers back in Week 7. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        In the closing seconds of the Mavericks' loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Nov. 10, PJ Washington stood at the free-throw line with the chance to tie the game and potentially send it to overtime. After Washington converted the first one, the second one clanked off the front of the rim. Fans in attendance immediately broke out into a \"Fire Nico\" chant as Washington took his third free throw, which he also missed. The Mavericks recorded their eighth loss on the season and the frustrations with the team's roster and front office impossible to ignore.Less than 24 hours after those chants rang down on Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison as he sat in attendance for the game, he's now out of a job. Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont said in a statement that the decision was made in part to show the team's commitment to \"building a championship-caliber organization, one that delivers for our players, our partners, and most importantly, our fans.\"It's a decision that was a long time coming, nine months in the making since Harrison executed what is undoubtedly the worst trade in NBA history. Trading Luka Dončić to the Lakers for a package that centered around Anthony Davis on Feb. 2 not only shocked the NBA or sports world but became a talking point beyond that. Even Southwest Airlines took a jab at the Mavericks in a post about ending their free checked bag policy: \"It's not like we traded Luka...\" read the announcement.Harrison's name will forever be synonymous with a trade so unfavorable that fans began protesting outside the arena as soon as news broke. But his legacy will be explained by all the players he traded -- or let walk -- in the lead up to the Dončić trade.\n1. Kristaps PorziņģisThe first splash that Harrison made after he was hired in June 2021 came eight months later when he traded Kristaps Porziņģis to the Washington Wizards for Spencer Dinwiddie, Davis Bertans and Dallas' own future second-round pick. Porziņģis' tenure with the Mavericks was a lopsided one, but there were genuine bright spots with him and Dončić on the floor together. They were dream pick-and-roll partners thanks to Porziņģis' ability to pop out for a jumper, roll to the rim for a lob or just provide a solid screen for Dončić to create space. The issue often centered around Porziņģis' health, but two years after that deal, he became a champion with the Boston Celtics. We can look back on that deal and say, OK, Harrison was smart to make that trade because the Mavericks made it to the Western Conference finals that season. But at the time, the return made it confusing. Bertans was racking up DNP-CD's in between utterly horrible shooting performances (31.9% from 3-point range). Dinwiddie was a high usage, low efficiency guard who was causing friction in the Wizards' locker room.In the end, things didn't turn out too bad with this deal, but little did we know it would give Harrison a level of confidence that made him think every decision he made was the right one.\n2. Jalen BrunsonAside from trading Dončić, this is without a doubt Harrison's most egregious transaction. Just two months after making the Western Conference finals in 2022, the Mavericks made the incredibly confusing decision to allow Brunson to walk to the New York Knicks for nothing in return. Never mind the fact that Brunson carried the Mavericks when Dončić was sidelined for a portion of the first round against the Jazz. Harrison felt fine letting Brunson walk to the Knicks. The same Brunson who has since become a bonafide All-Star and MVP candidate and took the Knicks to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years last season.The most confounding part of the Brunson situation? If the Mavericks had no intention on keeping him, why not trade him to get something in return? It's on the record that Brunson was willing to take a substantially cheaper deal prior to the start of the season, and again in January 2022 with the hopes of remaining in Dallas long term. Mavericks brass declined and have had to watch Brunson blossom into one of the best guards in the league.The Mavericks once looked like geniuses when they managed to draft both Dončić and Brunson in the same class. That praise quickly turned into admonition after Brunson bolted for the Knicks. Harrison isn't the sole person responsible here; previous owner Mark Cuban also shares some blame in being arrogant in thinking there was no way Brunson would leave them. But, again, if the plan was to never re-sign Brunson, Harrison should have traded him at peak value and gotten something in return.\n3. Luka DončićI'll keep this short. You don't trade a perennial All-Star in the beginning of their prime for a soon-to-be 33 year old who has durability issues. You also don't make that trade and only net one first-round pick in return. That second part is more egregious than the first. You could talk me into an deluded reality in which a roster featuring Davis and Kyrie Irving is better than one led by Dončić, who just eights months prior to the trade led you to the NBA Finals. That roster is probably pretty good if you're playing 2K with injuries turned off. But we live in this reality, where both Davis and Irving are in their early-to-mid thirties, have long histories of injuries and, oh, neither of them are Luka Dončić.\n        \n            \n                Nico Harrison was done with the Mavericks the day he traded Luka Dončić; he just didn't know it\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt best, Davis and Irving are two of the greatest Robins in NBA history. Both were the perfect No. 2 options next to LeBron James' Batman on championship teams. Both have experience in trying to be \"the guy.\" Neither has had success in that role. Sure, Dončić is an unreliable defender even on the biggest stage and he complains to officials and he likes his hookah and beer like any regular 25-year-old dude. But that poorly conditioned 25 year old would still show up the next day and drill a game-winner en route to a 35-point performance.Dončić has been more durable than Davis, is leading the league in scoring (37.1) and has the Lakers out to a 5-2 start. He used the summer to focus on his diet and conditioning and is one of the frontrunners for MVP. Trading him for essentially a bag of Skittles and a lottery ticket should get you fired immediately. It took nine months for the Mavericks to figure that out.\n4. Quentin GrimesTwo days after making the worst trade in NBA history, Harrison lined up another stinker that often goes unnoticed. Grimes became a surprise contributor last season while Dončić was rehabbing from a calf strain. He had a few 20-point outings, but it was his effort on defense that made him essential in Dončić's absence. You know, the thing in which Harrison staked his entire career on by proclaiming \"defense wins championships\" after the Lakers trade? Grimes was an efficient shooter, could get to the rim and provided some necessary perimeter defense.Then Harrison traded him -- and a second-round pick -- to the 76ers in exchange for Caleb Martin. Since joining the Mavericks, Martin has appeared in just 23 games and is shooting an atrocious 23.8% from 3-point range. Meanwhile, in the immediate aftermath of the deal, Grimes went on to average over 20 points a game with Philadelphia, and this season looks like a frontrunner for Sixth Man of the Year.Grimes is the type of player who the Mavericks are quite literally desperate for right now: someone who can penetrate the defense, catch and shoot 3s and defend. Grimes would be killing it right now in Dallas with Irving out. Instead, the Mavs are forcing their 18-year-old No. 1 overall pick to play point guard despite no prior experience.\nThe Dončić trade was the straw that broke the camel's back for Harrison, but he's made several questionable decisions during his tenure. Any one of these moves would've gotten a general manager fired. But it took multiple missteps, an ownership change, a sellout streak ending and an incredibly vocal fanbase for Harrison to lose his job.\n            ",

The Spartans will look to exploit that mismatch while keeping their bowl hopes alive; a clean sweep in the final weeks would still earn them eligibility.

    "body": "\n        Nico Harrison's legacy is cemented as the guy who traded Luka Dončić. Patrick Dumont, who, as the son-in-law of Mavericks majority owner Miriam Adelson, serves as the team's governor, definitely signed off on the deal and should not be spared a single ounce of ridicule, but sons-in law of owners don't get fired. General managers do. On Tuesday, Dumont and the Mavericks made it official. Harrison is out. Canned. Fired. And rightfully so. Nobody wants to celebrate someone losing their job, but this isn't a normal situation. Harrison isn't going to be standing in any soup lines and he had a massive responsibility to captain an organizational ship that was carrying the most precious kind of homegrown superstar cargo that comes along once in a generation, if not a lifetime. All he had to do was make sure the thing stayed on course. Instead, he sunk it. \n        \n            \n                Mavericks fire Nico Harrison: General manager ousted less than a year after Luka Dončić trade\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThere's a Titanic reference to be made here, but at least the iceberg it hit was mostly invisible. Anyone who couldn't see, clear as day, the disaster that trading Dončić would be was basketball blind. No less, Harrison did it for an utterly ridiculous return, laughably low even by the moronic standards of that one fantasy football guy who thinks he's just outsmarted everyone else by swapping prime Tom Brady for some flex-player flavor of the week.Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and one first-round draft pick? For Luka freaking Dončić? This is not hindsight is 20-20 stuff. There is no chance a 25-year-old superstar, who didn't demand the trade and who is well on his way to being one of the greatest players of all time, will ever be hung out on that kind of clearance rack again. \nHe never should've been for sale in the first place. But at least if you're going to mount your \"defense wins championships\" high horse, list the guy on the open market. Harrison could have cleaned up. All-Star guys. Future draft picks. The whole nine. Instead, he got a couple scraps and an always-injured 31-year-old who, wouldn't you know it, wound up injured in his first game with the Mavericks and is currently sidelined with a bum Achilles as we speak. To be fair, Harrison hasn't gotten a fair shake at seeing his vision through. He knew the risks of Davis' health and Kyrie Irving's age and willingly signed up for an incredibly short title window in which everything had to go perfectly. But in the interest of equitable representation, had Irving not blown his ACL and if by some miracle Davis and everyone else had stayed healthy, the Mavericks were set up to be pretty damn good in a short-term setting.But hey, life, and certainly the NBA, is about results, and this thing went in the tank immediately. Somehow, the Mavericks, with a 1.8% chance, lucked into the top pick in June's draft, when they took another potential franchise icon in Cooper Flagg. Right away, Harrison, with absolutely no shame at all, began spinning his \"I think the fans are finally starting to see the vision\" yarn. \nSorry, bud. You don't get to claim credit for Cooper. You pitched a team that was ready to win a title, not the first overall pick by way the friendliest and most forgiving ping-pong ball on the planet. And even with Flagg, the Mavericks are a mess. Harrison, over a cup of coffee, ripped the organization's heart out and insisted it would come out stronger. That's not how transplants work, especially not when the replacement organ is way older and historically less healthy than the original one. I'm not a Mavericks fan. I have no emotional ties to the trade. And yet I'm still infuriated by it. The ego of it all. It's unfortunate that Dumont gets to keep his job. He could have said no to Nico. He's just as much to blame. Who knows who else had a role in letting that trade happen?But in the end, it's Harrison's cross to bear. It's his legacy. There are conflicting ideas about the degree to which Harrison, a former Nike executive, was at least partly (if not largely) responsible for screwing up Stephen Curry's sales pitch by calling him \"Seth\" and leaving Kevin Durant's pictures in a seemingly copied-and-pasted presentation. For a long time that blunder hung over him. Not anymore. Trading Dončić is an unfixable, go-on-your-tombstone type mistake that will define him for the rest of his professional life. \nThe Mavericks will try to move on with Flagg and my guess is they're sitting in their big-wig offices right now repeating \"just wait until Davis and Irving come back healthy\" again and again. They still think they can come out of this thing relatively clean just because they scrubbed themselves of their dirtiest public face. They can't. This is the kind of thing that puts a spell on an organization. This is Curse of the Bambino stuff. Yes, in a twisted way, I realize that Flagg is a part of this deal in the sense that they would never have been in position to draft him without dealing Dončić. That kind of fortune is not in keeping with a curse. But I don't believe in lightning striking twice. Getting Flagg was a matter of survival. He's the dinghy the Mavericks had to pile into as the ship sunk. And if they're not careful, the dinghy is going to sink, too.The Mavericks have to change course. Every other part of the Dončić trade that remains in the Dallas DNA has to go. It started with Harrison, and if logic prevails, it will continue with Davis and Irving and right on down the role-player line. \nIt's a shame. It didn't have to be this way. Dallas was in the Finals two years ago. Dončić was 25 years old. It was all in front of them. But Harrison just couldn't stay out of his own way. He had to be smarter than the rest of the basketball world. He didn't know it, but he was done the second he made that trade. It just took some time to make it official. \n            ",

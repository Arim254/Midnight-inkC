    "body": "\n        Saturday features another elite college basketball schedule, along with LeBron James and Luka Doncic in NBA action, providing plenty of chances to take advantage of the current DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins.

But rather than jumping on a side, the SportsLine Projection Model finds the best value in taking Under 170.5 total points in its Saturday college basketball best bets at DraftKings. The Under is 7-2-1 over the last 10 Florida games.The model is also backing the Warriors to upset the Lakers at +145 odds for Saturday NBA best bets.

The model entered Week 19 on a sizzling 38-18 roll on top-rated NBA spread picks dating back to last season. Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Saturday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookUnder 170.5 in Florida vs. ArkansasWarriors (+145) vs. Lakers Saint Mary's (+1.5) vs. GonzagaCombining the three picks into a Saturday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +863 (risk $100 to win $863, odds subject to change). Bet it at DraftKings here:Under 170.5 in Florida vs. Arkansas (-108)The Under is 7-2-1 over the last 10 Florida games, and has also cashed in six of the last 11 Arkansas contests. Florida and Arkansas have two of the best offenses in college basketball. Arkansas ranks second in scoring at 90.3 points per game, with Florida 16th at 86.3 ppg. However, that has driven this total to a number the model views as an overreaction. The Gators have also consistently finished below the market's inflated totals. They've gone Under this total in 13 straight head-to-head matchups, and the model projects the Under to hit in 56.8% of simulations. Back the Under at DraftKings here:Warriors (+145) vs. LakersThe Lakers have lost three straight, most recently falling to the Suns, 113-110, on Thursday. Before then, Los Angeles fell to the Magic at the buzzer and lost to Boston, 111-89, at home. The Lakers were favored against the Magic and Suns and only 1.5-point underdogs against Boston, as they've underperformed in recent games that the sportsbooks expected them to win. The model projects that formula to repeat itself Saturday with the Warriors winning as underdogs. The Warriors are 31-28 this season compared to the Lakers' 34-24 mark, but the Warriors are 19-11 at home this season. The model projects the Warriors to win in 58% of simulations, compared to their implied odds of 40.8%. Back the Warriors to win at DraftKings here:Saint Mary's (+1.5) vs. Gonzaga (-105)\"St. Mary's is 16-0 at home this season, is on a seven-game winning streak, and will be a tough out in the NCAA Tournament,\" SportsLine expert Eric Cohen said. \"Since 2024, Randy Bennett's team has beaten Mark Few and the 'Zags four of the last seven times they've played. With a raucous crowd on Senior Day in Moraga, I think the Gaels win this game by 5-7 points.\" Back the Gaels to cover at DraftKings here:Want more NBA and college basketball picks on Saturday?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

    "body": "\n        Despite lucrative offers exceeding $6 million, former Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson says he never considered entering the transfer portal and playing another season of college football at another school for an enhanced payday after he declared for the NFL Draft in January.As ex-teammate Alabama Jalen Milroe and former Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers from last year's draft class have previously admitted, Simpson spurned opportunities because how he was viewed by Crimson Tide fans and others around the program meant something to him.\"It was very flattering for (other schools) to call and ask what I am feeling. Ask that I had another year, if I wanted to play another year of college football,\" Simpson told Pro Football Talk on Friday. \"One, I didn't want to play for another team. There wasn't a team that I wanted to play for besides Alabama. I didn't want to ruin my legacy. And I was ready to go to the NFL.\"Simpson isn't the only projected draft pick at the NFL combine who passed on a significant pay bump to play elsewhere during his college career. Notre Dame running back Jadarian Price, the second-best ballcarrier available per CBS Sports behind former teammate Jeremiyah Love, could have jumped from the Fighting Irish after an appearance in the national championship in 2024, but wanted another crack at chasing a title ring.\n\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top DB prospects, plus other standout performers from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMany NFL franchises touched on the subject with Price during interviews, wondering why he was OK with playing behind Love.\"Half of them ask about (a light workload), the other half ask, 'Why didn't you go somewhere else and want to be a feature back?'\" Price said Friday from Indianapolis. \"I just tell them Notre Dame was the place for me, and ultimately at the end (NFL officials) are like, 'We do respect that and we're glad you made that decision.'\"Price's NIL deal with the Fighting Irish increased before his final season last fall when he rushed for 674 yards and 11 touchdowns, but if it was exclusively about contract figures, he would have been playing for a different program.  \n\"The only difficult thing was having to tell my mom that a school has offered me this amount of money and then telling her that I wasn't going to do that,\" Price said. \"That was hard. Money can be a big thing, but it's not all. It isn't everything. That's what I truly believe.\"Playing for one of college football's biggest brands and keeping his mindset locked on the next level helped, Price said.\"Just keeping my head down and working and understanding that I'm going to create generational wealth later down the line,\" Price said. \"It's not all about money right now. I wanted to make sure I had the intangibles to get into the league and make sure I made real money that's going to carry me and help my family out.\"\nBuffalo linebacker Red Murdock, who is only the 10th player in program history and first since 2001 invited to the combine, attended Fork Union Military Academy out of high school before signing with the only FBS program that offered him.Murdock had a chance to leave the Group of Six program after the 2024 season following a Bahamas Bowl Defensive MVP performance, but stuck around to finish what he started. Murdock finished his four-year career at Buffalo with 17 forced fumbles, breaking an NCAA record and program record once held by Khalil Mack, the only first-round pick in school history.\"I'm very big on watering your grass … I'm not moved by any type of materialistic thing,\" Murdock said Wednesday. \"I want to look back 20 years and be proud of what I left at Buffalo and I know I did all I could to do so. That's something I can go to sleep at night and have peace with rather than chasing any external validation.\"\nThen there's Arkansas defensive lineman Cam Ball, a unicorn of sorts as a five-year player at one school in this year's draft cycle. During the portal era, most development for players comes across multiple programs, or if you're NFL-ready, three years and out is the route.\"I'm one of those rare players in today's age that was there all five years,\" Ball said. \"They gave me all the tools and keys to succeed and what I needed to be here today. Arkansas did a tremendous job for it and I'm a forever proud alum.\"At 6-4, 310, Ball tied for the sixth-best vertical jump (32 inches) as an interior defensive lineman and is one of six former Razorbacks at the combine. He is the only one of those invitees, however, who initially signed with Arkansas and didn't transfer into the program.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Carson Beck never had plans to play college football during the 2025 season until an unexpected injury late in his career at Georgia altered his future. Beck, who led Miami to a national championship game appearance last month, said this week from the NFL combine that the Bulldogs already had their next quarterback in line when another opportunity within his own career was presented last January.Beck suffered a serious injury during the SEC title game that caused him to miss the College Football Playoff. And rather than declare for the NFL Draft at that time, he entered the transfer portal and landed at Miami in a highly publicized move. The idea that there's any animosity between him, Georgia coach Kirby Smart and his former program is false, Beck said. \"I feel like people kind of take that the wrong way,\" Beck said of his transfer to Miami. \"You look at the beginning of the 2024 season going into it, I mean, nobody envisioned that season going that way. I didn't know I would get injured at the end of that season or that I would come back to college another year. That was not the plan, right? When the injury happened, I was going to the NFL. I had declared, I was going to go through the process and from that point on, I'm gone. Gunner [Stockton] is next up. When I decided to not go to the NFL and come back, I was going to go somewhere else. \"That's kind of how it all worked out. There's no bad blood. I'm really never sure where that came from. I love the University of Georgia, coach Smart, coach [Mike] Bobo, coach [Todd] Monken and all the other coaches I was able to have there and my teammates as well.\"\nBeck committed to the Hurricanes in January 2025 as the top-rated player in the transfer portal. He posted a 24-3 record as a starter for Georgia, throwing for 3,485 yards (fourth in the SEC) and 28 touchdowns (second in the SEC) in 13 games during the 2024 season before the postseason injury, along with inconsistent play, limited his draft stock.\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grading top TE prospects as Kenyon Sadiq, Eli Stowers deliver all-time performances\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAt Miami, Beck managed 3,813 yards and 30 touchdowns with a completion rate at 72.4%, helping the Hurricanes beat Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss in the CFP before falling to Indiana in the title game.\"My time at Georgia was honestly such a growth period of my life,\" Beck said. \"What Coach Smart was able to instill, not only in me but the rest of my team, was unbelievable. Just the thing we did there, the skull sessions, the connection we built as a team. It's something that was never fake, something that was very real in my eyes. The discipline and structure you learn just from being in that program. It's not easy there, you're working your tail off. I'm super grateful for coach Smart.\"\nCarson Beck's connection to new Browns coachBeck was Monken's quarterback at Georgia for three seasons during his run as offensive coordinator for the Bulldogs. Over 34 total appearances under Monken's tutelage, Beck threw for 7,736 yards with 56 touchdowns and 18 interceptions. Could the two reunite now that Monken is coaching the Cleveland Browns?Beck said his relationship with Monken started when he was a kid playing baseball with Monken's son. The Browns are one of several teams that engaged in a formal interview with Beck, who said he would be \"super stoked\" to play for Monken in the NFL.\"He's an amazing coach. I had the opportunity to talk with him a little bit the other day when I was done with all my interviews,\" Beck said. \"We walked and chatted for a little bit. I love Coach Monk. He's an awesome coach and great guy.\"\nAccording to CBS Sports' NFL Draft rankings, Beck is slotted as the seventh-best available option at quarterback and the No. 199 prospect overall.\"To get to this point, and to have the injury and battle through that and fight through that, and have the success of some of these great teams I've been a part of, it's been a really cool experience,\" Beck said in Indianapolis. \"I'm obviously super blessed and grateful to even be able to stand in front of you today.\"In Cleveland, Monken inherits a franchise downtrodden by quarterback play in recent years. The former Baltimore Ravens OC said this month he plans to have an open quarterback competition this offseason between Shedeur Sanders, Dillon Gabriel and Deshaun Watson.\nSanders and Gabriel were two of three starters last season for the Browns, who opened with veteran Joe Flacco as QB1. Watson did not play during the 2025 campaign after tearing his Achilles midway through the 2024 season and then suffering the same injury a few months later. \"I don't know why it wouldn't be an open competition, and I don't mean that harshly, but I don't think there's enough on film over the last couple years, one way or the other, to say, 'Boy, we have a starter at quarterback' yet, whether internally or externally,\" Monken said.\n            ",

While it could be seen as a low-risk, high-reward situation for Kavanagh, he is coming off of his first loss, a second-round knockout against Charles Johnson this past August.

That loss ran Moreno's record to 2-3 in his five most recent fights, and 4-4 since the start of 2022.\nMoreno first won the flyweight title at UFC 263, defeating Deiveson Figueiredo after the two battled to a draw in their first fight.

    "body": "\nFormer major league pitcher Dan Serafini has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents at their home in Lake Tahoe, according to the Associated Press. Serafini was found guilty of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr, and attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood.Wood survived a gunshot wound to the head but needed extensive rehabilitation. She died by suicide a year later, her daughter, Adrienne Spohr, told KCRA. Serafini is married to Erin Spohr, who testified during the trial.\"Dan Serafini executed my dad and left my mom to die,\" Adrienne Spohr told reporters following Serafini's sentencing, according to the Sacramento Bee. \"My mom fought with everything she could and did not let Dan Serafini win. Dan Serafini is finally being held accountable and will spend the rest of his life behind bars.\"Prosecutors said Serafini hated his wife's parents and offered $20,000 to whoever would carry out the killings. He broke into their home and waited for them to return before carrying out the shootings. Serafini described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes\" during his sentencing, according to My News NBC 4.\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate  victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and  highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" District Attorney Morgan Gire said Friday.Serafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025. Several motions for a new trial were denied.A first-round pick in 1992, Serafini appeared in seven seasons with the Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, and Colorado Rockies from 1996-2007. He also pitched in Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan, and for Italy in the 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        With the Royal Rumble in the rear-view mirror, there's only one path to a world championship match at WrestleMania, and that path is winning the Elimination Chamber. The event takes place on Saturday at United Center in Chicago.Six men and six women will enter the Elimination Chamber, with the winners of the men's and women's matches earning their shot at a world title. With men's Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns already choosing world heavyweight champion CM Punk and women's winner Liv Morgan selecting women's world champion Stephanie Vaquer, that leaves WWE champion Drew McIntyre and WWE women's champion Jade Cargill for the Elimination Chamber winners.The men's match got a late swerve on the final SmackDown before the event. Jey Uso, who earned a spot in the match with a win on Monday over Bronson Reed and El Grande Americano, was taken out backstage by an unknown assailant. That led SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis to book an impromptu match between Jacob Fatu and Logan Paul for the final spot in the Chamber, which Paul won with some outside assistance.Also on Saturday, CM Punk will put his world heavyweight championship on the line against Finn Balor. The pair put on an epic match in Balor's home country of Ireland earlier this month. Balor has demanded a rematch after coming up short and if successful, he would take Punk's main event spot at WrestleMania 42 against Roman Reigns.\nPlus, Punk's wife, AJ Lee will wrestle her first singles match in over a decade when she takes on Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental championship. Lee teamed with Punk against Rollins and Lynch last year in Lee's first match back with the company. Now, she looks for her first singles win since 2015.\n        \n            \n                Drew McIntyre reacts to WWE scrapping John Cena match at Crown Jewel: 'I can't change the creative direction'\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLet's take a look at who the CBS Sports experts believe will emerge victorious on Saturday in Chicago.2026 WWE Elimination Chamber predictionsMen's Elimination Chamber Match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Logan Paul: Many times, picking a winner in a match like this comes down to eliminating who wouldn't be a winner. Evans and Williams aren't currently at the level where they'll be going one-on-one for a world championship at WrestleMania. Orton is a legend, but not one who is in a place where he makes sense as a WrestleMania headliner in 2026. That leaves Knight and Rhodes, only one of whom has an ongoing issue -- which some may say has been ongoing for far too long -- with McIntyre. That makes the outcome seem fairly obvious. Pick: Cody Rhodes wins -- Brent Brookhouse (also Shakiel Mahjouri)\nWomen's Elimination Chamber Match -- Tiffany Stratton vs. Rhea Ripley vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: The winner of this match will challenge WWE women's champion Jade Cargill at WrestleMania. Those stakes help narrow the field. The champ looks like a box office star, so WWE should pick a challenger with star power and experience. Asuka and Cargill are both heels, and while that sometimes works, it doesn't gel well here. Bliss fits the bill, but she's more interesting teaming with Charlotte Flair. Ripley vs. Cargill screams WrestleMania, a collision between two of WWE's most powerful women. Ripley's status as women's tag team champion complicates things, but there's more upside here than retreading Cargill vs. Stratton. Pick: Ripley wins -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)World Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: It's nice to see Balor positioned like a major player once again, and equally nice that it is signaling the end of his time in Judgment Day, but there's just no way WWE pivots from Punk vs. Reigns at WrestleMania to Balor vs. Reigns. It was nice to see WWE finally bring up the bizarre ending to Balor vs. Reigns at Extreme Rules 2021, but that's not enough foundation for a WrestleMania main event. Pick: CM Punk retains the title -- Brookhouse (also Mahjouri)Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk will smooth things over for Chicago after a rough start for their adopted hero Lee. The women's intercontinental champion needs a successful title defense, especially with the potential for another showdown at WrestleMania. Lee has wrestled twice in 10 years, beating Lynch in WarGames and a mixed tag team match with their husbands. Expect Lynch to steal a victory through nefarious means ahead of a one-on-one rematch in Las Vegas. Pick: Lynch retains the title -- Mahjouri (also Brookhouse)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Player movement in college football happens faster than ever before in this era, and the 2026 transfer portal window was no exception. Many who were originally slated for greatness at one school can suddenly find themselves on the move. Big names can move for any number of reasons. There's the case of players who busted at previous schools and are now looking for playing time. In other cases, players might transfer for the chance to win big or play around better talent. And then, of course, there are instances of players simply leaving for more opportunity. Last season, several big names managed to reestablish themselves at new destinations. Georgia's Carson Beck had a career revival at Miami, leading them to the national title game. The same is true of one-time five-star recruit Raleek Brown, who left USC to star at Arizona State. Here are some of the high-profile names that will find themselves in new places during the 2026 season. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    QB Jackson ArnoldOld schools: Auburn, Oklahoma | New school: UNLVThree years ago, Arnold was rated the No. 1 recruit in Texas. Now, he's set to move on to his third school. However, Arnold made a wise choice by teaming up with quarterback whisperer Dan Mullen, who has a history of getting the most out of his signal-callers. Mullen helped turn Anthony Colandrea into one of the Mountain West's top quarterbacks, and Arnold will fit right in. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RB CJ BaxterOld school: Texas | New school: KentuckyBaxter was once a can't-miss running back recruit out of Orlando, but struggled to live up to his five-star status because of injuries. After 54 carries for 196 yards last season, Baxter joins new head coach Will Stein at Kentucky. Baxter teams up with quarterback Kenny Minchey (Notre Dame), wide receiver Nic Anderson (LSU) and offensive lineman Lance Heard (Tennessee). \n        \n            \n                Ranking college football's deepest WR rooms in 2026: Texas, Miami, Indiana add through portal\n                \n                    Brad Crawford                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    DB Boo CarterOld school: Tennessee | New school: ColoradoCarter was rumored to leave for Colorado last season before ultimately returning to Tennessee. After a tumultuous sophomore season, Carter is finally landing in Boulder to play for Coach Prime. The rising junior was one of the top freshman defensive backs in America in 2024 and should quickly become a critical piece for an improving defense. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RB Justice HaynesOld schools: Alabama, Michigan | New school: Georgia TechGeorgia Tech might have graduated two of their \"Haynes,\" but restocked with arguably the most talented running back in America. Despite recording only 121 carries for Michigan before injury, he exploded for 857 yards and 10 touchdowns. Joining a run-based program at Georgia Tech should allow his numbers to rise off the charts, especially next to transfer quarterback Alberto Mendoza (Indiana). \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RB Makhi HughesOld schools: Oregon, Tulane | New school: HoustonHughes was the best Group of Six running back in America when he transferred to Oregon, but failed to crack the rotation on a loaded team. Now, he's set to return to his former Tulane coaches -- Willie Fritz and Slade Nagle -- in the Big 12. In two seasons with the Green Wave, Hughes posted an absurd 2,779 yards and 22 touchdowns. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    QB DJ LagwayOld school: Florida | New school: BaylorLagway was rated the No. 1 quarterback in his recruiting class when the Texas native committed to the Gators. Two years later, he leaves Gainesville and returns to his home state, where he will try to turn around the Baylor Bears. Lagway's father, Derek, played running back at Baylor in the 1990s. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    WR Omarion MillerOld school: Colorado | New school: Arizona StateThere are several high-profile Colorado players set to star in new places, including Jordan Seaton (LSU), Dre'lon Miller (Baylor) and Jehiem Oatis (Ole Miss). However, Miller was one of the stars of the 2025 roster and now joins Kenny Dillingham at Arizona State. The rising senior caught 45 passes for 808 yards and eight touchdowns, and averages more than 19 yards per reception for his career. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    QB Malachi NelsonOld schools: UTEP, Boise State, USC | New school: SyracuseNelson has undergone one of the most dramatic college careers in America, going from a five-star prospect at USC to a UTEP backup. Instead of resting on his laurels, Nelson is betting on himself by transferring to Syracuse to compete for reps under coach Fran Brown. It won't be easy with incumbent Steve Angeli returning for another season. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    QB Beau PribulaOld schools: Missouri, Penn State | New school: VirginiaPribula was solid for Missouri, but dealt with injuries and turnover issues as the season went along. Instead of staying put, he decided to transfer and landed at Virginia. Making matters strange, Chandler Morris is campaigning for a seventh year of eligibility. While his chances are small, it could lead to an awkward quarterback battle. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    QB Jaden RashadaOld schools: Sacramento State, Georgia, Arizona State | New school: Mississippi StateLike Nelson, Rashada has had a tough go since a botched recruitment at Florida. He was benched after only one game at Sacramento State, and now he is taking a chance on himself by transferring to Jeff Lebby's Mississippi State. The Bulldogs return highly-touted underclassman Kamario Taylor, so there's little chance he will see the field. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    DL Damon Wilson IIOld schools: Missouri, Georgia | New school: MiamiWilson was an unfortunate loss for Georgia late in the 2024 offseason. Now, Missouri is going through the same thing after Wilson opted to join the national finalists at Miami. Wilson posted nine sacks, an interception and two passes defended during a breakout season, including two sacks against Alabama. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    RB Quintrevion WisnerOld school: Texas | New school: Florida StateWisner was the only returning 1,000-yard rusher in the SEC last season, but struggled to maintain his production behind a lackluster offensive line. His carries were nearly halved in the process. However, he now joins an offense at Florida State that should cater well to his skill set. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        CBS Sports this season has unleashed a new method behind our NCAA men's basketball tournament bracket projections, and while we release the daily seeded field and bubble here every morning, we've unearthed so many more data points that tell the story of what will happen on Selection Sunday well in advance. And on this, the last day before March, we get a weekend packed with storylines coming from a slate of great games on CBS.  Let's take a look at these four key games, where the teams playing them currently stand and how things could play out in the final two weeks of the season:     San Diego State at New Mexico  Saturday, 2 p.m. ET  TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium    It's a \"double bubble\" matchup between two teams right on the fringes of at-large candidacy, but there's another key element behind this game. Utah State (23-5, 13-4 MWC), which already has a solid at-large candidacy, is our SportsLine prediction model pick to win the Mountain West Conference Tournament (36% chance).\nSan Diego State (19-8, 13-4) has the tiebreaker on Utah State, while New Mexico (21-7, 12-5) is in third -- meaning they'd face the Aggies in the semifinals in the current seed list. The Lobos already lost by 20 at home to Utah State and close their season on the road against the Aggies. Our current projection has San Diego State in as the league's autobid, while New Mexico is among the first teams out. But neither of these teams should rely on that autobid, and both would be well served to win as many remaining games as possible before a potential MWC championship game against Utah State.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: No. 1 seeds Duke, Arizona face battles but have margin for error in NCAA Tournament projection\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n Texas Tech at Iowa State Saturday, 4 p.m. ET TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium   \nThe NCAA Tournament committee told us in a recent mock selection process that no number is more important to a team's seeding than Wins Above Bubble, which measures how strong a team's résumé really is. That doesn't look great today for Iowa State's argument against UConn for the fourth No. 1 seed in this field.  The Huskies are fourth in WAB, while the Cyclones are ninth. But Iowa State has a much tougher schedule (at Arizona is next) and can make up almost all of that ground if both teams win out. While UConn is projected to still be fourth in that scenario, Iowa State would move up to fifth and have more Quadrant 1 wins and a better NET ranking and likely maintain its higher position in predictive metrics. The Cyclones still probably need a hiccup from UConn and none of their own, but the path is clearer now that Houston and Purdue have fumbled. On the Texas Tech side, this game is important because they are attempting to prove they still deserve to be seeded strongly despite the injury to reigning Big 12 Player of the Year JT Toppin. Our SportsLine simulations have dinged Tech for that injury, but the Red Raiders close the season with this game and another road test against BYU sandwiched around a home game against TCU, and those plus the Big 12 tournament afford them plenty of chances to prove their ability without Toppin. \n Purdue at Ohio State Sunday, 1:30 p.m. ET TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium    Michigan State at Indiana Sunday, 3:45 p.m. ET TV: CBS | Live stream: CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App, Paramount+ Premium  While Purdue and Michigan State are part of a pack of teams that will fill out the No. 2-5 seed lines, the really interesting thing here with CBS Sports' Big Ten Conference doubleheader is actually the two home teams and how they intertwine. Ohio State and Indiana both took tough losses this week that knocked them out of our bracket, but wins on Sunday would put them right back either in or on the cusp. \nFurthermore, they close the season against each other next weekend (with relatively soft mid-week opponents in between). If Ohio State and Indiana both can win Sunday at home, there's a very good chance that next weekend's winner will reach March Madness, while the loser will need a stunning run in the Big Ten Tournament to make the field. Here's how we project the result of this weekend's games will impact their standing as at-large candidates:    TeamCurrentW/WinW/LossOhio State35.6%40.4%17.9%Indiana22.3%37.1%17.6%And if you are wondering, the SportsLine model gives the Buckeyes a 64% chance to win that season finale at home.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Road to WrestleMania has reached its final prelude. WWE has just one PPV left before the greatest show of them all in April and that's the Elimination Chamber. WWE returns to Chicago on Saturday night for the epic event where two superstars will punch their ticket to WrestleMania 42 by outlasting five others inside the sadistic structure. The men's match has some massive names looking to return to a headlining role at WrestleMania (Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton) but it also has some men looking to make their mark and earn their first headlining spot (LA Knight, Je'Von Evans and Trick Williams).The men's match got a late swerve on the final SmackDown before the event. Jey Uso, who earned a spot in the match with a win on Monday over Bronson Reed and El Grande Americano, was taken out backstage by an unknown assailant. That led SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis to book an impromptu match between Jacob Fatu and Logan Paul for the final spot in the Chamber, which Paul won with some outside assistance.\nOn the women's side, four former champions are set to compete in Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka while two newer competitors look to make a splash in Kiana James and Raquel Rodriguez.The other two matches are near and dear to the fans in Chicago. World heavyweight champion CM Punk puts his title on the line in front of his hometown fans when he takes on Finn Balor. And Punk's wife, AJ Lee, challenges Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental title in her first singles match in more than a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Saturday with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET. Be sure to check out our predictions for each match as well. \n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.Elimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Logan Paul: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw. Williams earned the penultimate spot by beating Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest. Jey Uso initially earned the final spot in the match, but he was taken out on SmackDown, leading to a match between Fatu and Logan Paul, which Paul won thanks to some additional help.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.\nElimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie. James snuck a pinfall over Charlotte Flair in their match with Nia Jax. Rodriguez has the chance to join Judgment Day Liv Morgan in challenging for a world championship at WrestleMania after defeating Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane in the final qualifier.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        An early start to beat the storms meant players were treated to ideal scoring conditions on Saturday at the 2026 Cognizant Classic. While plenty went low and improved their standing, no one did more damage than Shane Lowry, who shot an 8-under 63 to take the lead alone at 13 under going into Sunday's final round. Lowry is eying his first solo win anywhere since capturing the 2022 BMW PGA Championship in Europe and first in a PGA Tour-sanctioned tournament since the 2019 Open Championship.After struggling mightily with the putter on the West Coast, Lowry finally had a breakthrough on the greens on Saturday, gaining more than 2.1 strokes on the field with his putter. He seems much more comfortable back on Bermuda grass in his adopted home state of Florida. A strong putting performance combined with continued excellent ball-striking is the formula for going low, and Lowry was aggressive from the start of his third round, opening with a birdie and adding four more on the front nine to go out in 30. \nLowry added another on the 10th, and then, after a string of pars, closed with a flourish with birdies on the 17th and 18th to post the low round of the day with a bogey-free 63. \n\"Everything went pretty well, especially early on. I hit the ball in the fairway a lot yesterday, and I missed a few fairways early today, but I holed a few nice putts at the start,\" Lowry said. \"Then I started hitting the ball really well and giving myself lots of chances and converted a few, and I felt like it was just a really nice, solid round of golf. Birdieing the last two was kind of the icing on the cake.\"While Lowry and plenty of others were going low on Saturday, 36-hole leader Austin Smotherman spent much of his round stuck in the mud. After sleeping on a three-shot lead, Smotherman got off to a fast start with a couple of early birdies, but back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 6 and 7 derailed his momentum, and he spent most of Saturday just trying to hold on in a scratchy round of golf. However, he found a little something late with back-to-back birdies to close his round like Lowry, moving himself into a tie for the lead with a 69. Thanks to Smotherman's minor stumble, the top of the leaderboard is now a crowded place; nine players are within five shots of the leaders. The biggest movers of Saturday were Patton Kizzire, who matched Lowry's 63 to move into T9 at 8 under, going from on the cut line to the top 10, while Keith Mitchell and Beau Hossler also moved to T9 with matching 64s. Ricky Castillo's 64 jumped him into sixth at 10 under, as the Florida graduate put himself in contention to pick up his first career win. \nThat sets up a fascinating final round where the wind is supposed to pick up once again, creating challenging conditions for Lowry and the chase pack. We've seen all week how volatile the scoring has been, and depending on when the wind arrives, those who go out earlier in the day could post a number while the leaders battle the elements in the afternoon. Leaders1. Shane Lowry, Austin Smotherman (-13): Lowry's last four starts at the Cognizant Classic have seen him finish 2, T5, T4 and T11. It's a virtual home game for Lowry, who lives in the area, and it's clear how comfortable he is on this kind of course. The ball-striking is there, and now that he seems to have some confidence with the putter, he's looking to pick up his fourth career win on the PGA Tour at a tournament he's long loved playing in. Sunday will bring a much different challenge in terms of the weather, but you wouldn't expect stiff winds to bother the Irishman too much, though he also needs his putter to hold up.As for Smotherman, he would've preferred to shoot a 66 and maintain his three-shot advantage going into Sunday, but while he didn't have his best on Saturday, he can take positives away from the way he closed his round. His putter cooled off, and some loose shots did not exist early in the tournament, but he kept it on the tracks and produced his best golf on the final two holes to stay in a share of the lead for the third straight day. The final round will be a challenge he's never really encountered playing in the final group with the lead, but perhaps Saturday's ups and downs can provide him with a bit of comfort knowing what's to come. \nContendersT3. Nico Echavarria, Taylor Moore (-12)5. Jimmy Stanger (-11)T6. Ricky Castillo, A.J. Ewart (-10) 7. Joel Dahmen (-9)T9. Beau Hossler, Keith Mitchell, Patton Kizzire (-8)Echavarria looked poised to go even lower than his 5-under 66, but he had a few solid looks slide by the hole on otherwise good-looking putts. If he continues striking the ball the way he has and the putter warms up just a touch, he will be extremely dangerous on Sunday. Moore was briefly the solo leader before stumbling late like Smotherman, but he, too, found a birdie at the last to stay in touch and give himself a look at a second career win. Stanger, fresh off a Friday with two hole-out eagles, went about his 65 in a more conventional manner on Saturday, finishing fourth in strokes gained putting to climb into the top 5. Castillo and Ewart are two more youngsters trying to find their first win and will look to be aggressive on Sunday to try and make something happen from two groups behind the leaders. \nThen there's Dahmen, continuing a solid start to his 2026 with a third straight 68 to open his week. With the weather rolling in on Sunday, his steadier play this week could put him in contention if the more aggressive leaders struggle in tougher conditions. Dahmen is one of the many players in the field this week looking to solidify their place on the PGa Tour after just missing out on keeping a full Tour card last year. He seems to be taking a more patient approach this season that has him poised for a second top-10 finish in four starts. Updated 2026 Cognizant Classic odds, picksOdds via FanDuel SportsbookShane Lowry (+145)Austin Smotherman (4-1)Nico Echavarria (+490)Taylor Moore (6-1)Ricky Castillo (20-1)Jimmy Stanger (20-1)Lowry and Echavarria were the picks after Round 2, and nothing about the way Moving Day transpired changes those projections, though the value on Lowry is largely gone. Smotherman finished well, but his putter may not hold up on Sunday. There's a chance someone from a bit further back can make a run, given the conditions we'll see in the final round, and perhaps Dahmen (50-1) can present value by putting together another rock-solid round of golf and see some others stumble in tougher conditions. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Virginia and Kansas each have major opportunities on Saturday to optimize their seeding potential for the NCAA Tournament as the final day of February brings a college basketball schedule loaded with Bracketology implications. The Cavaliers are a No. 3 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology entering the day, while the Jayhawks are a No. 4. seed.Both are taking on projected No. 1 seeds on the road. Virginia travels to Durham, N.C. to face Duke while Kansas heads to Tucson to take on Arizona. If UVA topples No. 1 Duke on the road, it would send the Cavaliers' resume metrics soaring and open up new possibilities.At 25-3 (13-2 ACC), Virginia is thriving under first-year coach Ryan Odom. Despite their gaudy record, the Cavaliers have been held back to a certain degree — at least from a seeding perspective — by their light nonconference schedule. With the program getting a full reboot following last year's 15-17 season, Odom opted for a manageable nonconference slate that ranks 211th in NET strength. As a result, the Cavaliers haven't amassed the marquee victories required to flirt with the No. 2 seed line. Beating Duke would change that.If Kansas aspires to compete for a No. 3 seed or even a No. 2 seed, it will likely need to upset Arizona on the road. As the highest-ranked No. 4 seed in CBS Sports Bracketology, the Jayhawks would be well-positioned to rise if they won on the road as a 9.5-point underdog.

However, if Duke wants to retain the distinction of being the No. 1 overall seed, it needs to win. Michigan's Friday night victory over Illinois means the Wolverines remain squarely on the Blue Devils' heels in the race to be the top seed in the bracket. Even a loss against a good Virginia team by Duke would likely send Michigan back to the top spot.Rematch rulesAmid conference consolidation and the proliferation of nonconference matchups between high-major schools, the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee faces challenges when it comes to avoiding regular-season rematches. The 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket featured three potential second-round games between conference teams, although none of them came to fruition. The committee will still seek to minimize conference meetings and nonconference rematches, and our model is coded to do the same. However, NCAA bracketing principles permit games between conference teams in the second round, so long as the teams in question played each other just once before the NCAA Tournament. For conference teams that met twice prior to the NCAA Tournament, principles state they should not meet prior to the Sweet 16. If the teams played three times, NCAA bracketing principles state they should not play before the Elite Eight.\nWith regard to rematches of nonconference games, NCAA bracketing principles state that they should be avoided \"in the First Four and first round.\" The committee will also \"attempt to avoid\" nonconference rematches in the second round. But the committee has historically prioritized keeping teams on their natural seed line over changing their seed line for the sake of avoiding a rematch. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        For an owner who has often preferred patience and internal development over splashy signings, Jerry Jones sounded Friday like a man no longer interested in waiting. Thirty years have passed since the Dallas Cowboys last reached a Super Bowl, and the frustration is no longer subtle. Speaking at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, the 83-year-old Jones acknowledged the weight of that drought and pointed squarely at himself.\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said, according to ESPN. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind.\"The Cowboys are coming off a 7-9-1 season in 2025 and have missed the playoffs in back-to-back years after three straight postseason appearances from 2021-23. Their defense cratered last season, finishing near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed, a collapse that prompted a change at defensive coordinator and sharpened Jones' focus.The message this offseason is clear: Dallas intends to spend.\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\n        \n            \n                Cowboys place franchise tag on George Pickens: What's next for the star wide receiver?\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nFor a franchise that in recent years has largely avoided the top of the free-agent market -- choosing instead to re-sign its own stars such as quarterback Dak Prescott and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb -- the shift is notable.Dallas is projected to be over the newly set $301.2 million salary cap, but the club plans to restructure Prescott's and Lamb's contracts, along with left guard Tyler Smith, moves expected to create roughly $66 million in room. Additional maneuvering with defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa could further reshape the books.Jones framed the aggressive approach as both practical and urgent. Prescott is in his prime. Lamb remains one of the league's top playmakers. The Cowboys recently added running back Javonte Williams and used the franchise tag on wide receiver George Pickens, keeping another key piece in place for now.\n\"I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget,\" Jones said.The Cowboys also hold two first-round picks in the 2026 NFL Draft, ammunition Jones acknowledged could be used in trades if the right opportunity presents itself. He stopped short of promising a blockbuster but made clear he would not hesitate if it accelerates the timeline.At 83, Jones was reflective at times, but the competitive edge remains. Winning another Super Bowl, he said, sits above every professional goal he has.\n\"Make no mistake about it,\" Jones said. \"I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\"\n            ",

While they have a defense who will frustrate anyone, not scoring gives teams defensive pressure that they can't keep up with. How to watch Club America vs. Tigres UNAL, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 28 | Time: 10:10 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes -- Mexico City, MexicoLive stream: CBS Sports Golazo Network Odds: Club America+100; Draw +220; Tigres +270Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

For Tigres, Angel Correa has continued to pace the attack, but their defense has suffered while balancing multiple competitions at this early stage of the season. Now that they're through to the last 16 of Concacaf Champions Cup play, matches will spread out, which helps with a squad lacking depth. Neither team is where they want to be at this stage in the Clausura portion of the season, and that's just what makes this match important. It's too early to call anything a must-win, but when there are only 17 match days in the season before flipping to playoffs, everything is a sprint in Mexican soccer. The winner of the clash can go as high as fifth in the table, and while an undefeated Chivas Guadalajara side may be out of reach, ensuring that they have home-field advantage in the playoffs will be critical. Zendejas also has the additional motivation of the March international break inching closer by the day. With the World Cup rapidly approaching, it could be his final chance to make Mauricio Pochettino's squad, but a muscle strain could put his participation in doubt for this match. There are only four league matches remaining before the international break, so the clock is very much ticking. Liga MX schedule and resultsAll times EasternFriday, Feb. 27Mazatlan 1, Pachuca 0Queretaro 2, Santos Laguna 2Juarez 3, Atlas 1Club Tijuana 1, Pumas UNAM 1Saturday, Feb. 28Atlético San Luis vs. Puebla, 6 p.m.Toluca vs. Chivas Guadalajara, 6 p.m.Monterrey vs. Cruz Azul, 8:05 p.m.Club Leon vs. Necaxa, 8:06 p.m.Club América vs. Tigres UNAL, 10:10 p.m. (CBS Sports Golazo Network) \n            ",

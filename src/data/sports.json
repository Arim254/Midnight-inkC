    "body": "\n        Move over, Wilt Chamberlain, you have company. A high school basketball player in Arizona became the latest to join the 100-point club, and he needed just three quarters to do so.Adrian Stubbs, a guard at Phoenix (Ariz.) Maryvale, became the first player in Arizona high school basketball history to score 100 points in a game with his historic effort in a 109-25 victory over Yuma (Ariz.) Kofa on Tuesday. He scored 70 points in the first half and added 30 more to his tally in the third quarter before taking a seat on the bench for the final period.Stubbs shattered the 6A record, which belonged to recent Arizona Wildcats standout Nico Mannion at 57 points. He surpassed the state record of 75 points, which had stood since the 1965-66 1A season, early in the third quarter. Stubbs' previous career high was 56, one point shy of the 6A record.\"This kid doesn't cease to amaze me,\" Maryvale coach Jeremy Smith said to The Arizona Republic. \"His will to win and fight and grit are second to none. He's got a lot of people backing him, wanting the best for him. He's a gamer. Before the season started, we had team goals. And we have individual goals. One of his individual goals was to beat Nico Mannion's record of 57.\"\nIt was a remarkably efficient performance for Stubbs, who entered the game averaging 24 points per game and hardly missed a shot in Tuesday's contest. The majority of his conversions came on mid-range jumpers, and he connected on only six 3-pointers. He went 16-for-23 from the free throw line.Stubbs got off to a hot start with 35 points in the first quarter, and his teammates got out of the way as he continued to drill seemingly every shot he put up. He scored every single one of Maryville's points in the first half before Travis Dean and Meqhi Teutsch contributed two points apiece in the third quarter.\"I think I had 35 at the end of the first quarter and my coach gave me the green light,\" Stubbs said. \"I was going to go. That was probably the most unselfish game (from teammates) I've ever seen in my life. Without them, this would not be possible. All of those passes. All the steals. It's a huge shout out to them.\"\nStubbs is an unranked recruit in the 2026 class, per 247Sports. His only scholarship offers to date are from junior colleges.\n            ",

UFC 324 takes over Las Vegas with a headline-grabbing main event: Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett for the interim lightweight title. It all goes down from the T-Mobile Arena as the first numbered event of 2026.UFC CEO Dana White's announcement of the card during halftime of the Cowboys vs. Chiefs on Thanksgiving garnered widespread attention. Gaethje and Pimblett have been campaigning for a lightweight title shot. In the aftermath of 155-pound champion Ilia Topuria announcing he'd step away to deal with personal matters, Gaethje and Pimblett will fight for the interim title.Gaethje, the all-action veteran, has been in this position before. He previously held the interim lightweight title when he defeated Tony Ferguson in 2020. However, he has yet to hold the full championship after suffering defeats against Khabib Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira. \"The Highlight\" has managed to stay relevant late in his career, including a second win over Rafael Fiziev in March 2025.Pimblett, meanwhile, is a man on the rise as he looks to get his first piece of UFC gold. The Brit is undefeated in seven trips to the Octagon, including an impressive TKO of Michael Chandler last April. Gaethje represents by far the biggest test of Pimblett's young career.\nThe rest of the main card is loaded with interesting and important matchups within each division. The co-main event sees former bantamweight champion Sean O'Malley look to get back on track -- and hold his position in the division -- when he takes on rising contender Song Yadong. Plus, powerful heavyweights are set to collide when veteran and fan favorite Derrick Lewis returns to take on fast rising contender Waldo Cortes-Acosta. Former women's strawweight champion Rose Namajunas also looks to hold on to her position in the women's flyweight division when she takes on Natalia Silva. And the opening fight on the main card is sure to produce fireworks when Jean Silva takes on Arnold Allen at featherweight.Subscribe to Paramount+ now to get access to the UFC fight library and get ready for UFC 324\n        \n            \n                UFC Fan Guide: A playlist of some of the most exciting fights in history to get ready for the Paramount+ era\n                \n                    Brent Brookhouse                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nBelow is the complete fight card for UFC 324, along with the latest odds.

    "body": "\n        After two years of constant calls from coaches and college sports administrators for change to college basketball's transfer portal window protocols, the NCAA made a surprising announcement Wednesday afternoon.Effective immediately, men's and women's basketball players will not be able to enter the portal until the day after the NCAA Tournament ends in their respective sports. Additionally, the portal will be open for 15 days from its onset, the shortest window for entry yet. (There is no deadline for a player to commit to a school after they enter the portal.)This is a drastic switch from 2024, when the portal was open for 45 days and the process began the day after Selection Sunday. That year, eventual champion UConn hosted virtual interviews on Zoom in the team locker room during while at the Final Four. NC State even hosted a potential transfer on its campus before flying to the Final Four. Auburn faced a similar situation last year while it made its run to the final weekend of the season. (In 2025, the window to enter the portal was cut to 30 days but still opened after March Madness' opening weekend.) Moving forward, a more practical transfer window will be in place, with college basketball's \"free agency\" period waiting to commence until after all the games have been played. The decision was made amid the NCAA's annual convention, which is being held this week in Washington, D.C.\n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Kansas' upset of Iowa State could be turning point for Jayhawks\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe change won't stop players from announcing their intentions to transfer — and seeking traction/attention on social media — but it will stop the formal and necessary process of being registered in the transfer portal. Until that step happens, a player can't transfer nor commit elsewhere in an official capacity. \nMost importantly, the change should reduce a lot of the auxiliary noise off the court in college basketball and bring a return to most of the attention where it belongs: The NCAA Tournament.There are still special circumstances that will allow a player to go into the portal even after the window closes.\"When a head coaching change occurs, a 15-day period will open five days after the new head coach is hired or publicly announced,\" per the NCAA's press release. \"If a new head coach is not announced within 30 days of the previous head coach's departure — and the 31st day after the head coach's departure is after the championship game — a 15-day window will open. The additional head coach departure window is available only after the basketball transfer window opens through Jan. 2.\" \nThis year's NCAA Tournament will begin with the First Four in Dayton, Ohio, on March 17. The Final Four will be held in Indianapolis on April 4 and 6, meaning the portal free-for-all will begin on April. 7.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 PGA Tour schedule gets underway at the 2026 Sony Open in Hawaii on Thursday, Jan. 15. The season opener at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu comes a week later than normal after The Sentry was cancelled this year due to course concerns. That means there will be just one event on the Hawaii Swing this year, and some top players decided not to make the trip. Big names like Collin Morikawa, Hideki Matsuyama, J.J. Spaun and Jordan Spieth, however, are among the golfers in the Sony Open field as the first tee times in Round 1 come at 12:10 p.m. ET.The latest 2026 Sony Open odds from DraftKings Sportsbook list Russell Henley as the +1100 favorite. Matsuyama and Ben Griffin are at +1700, followed by Spaun at +1800. Morikawa joins Si Woo Kim and Robert MacIntyre at +2000. Before locking in any 2026 Sony Open picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship. Anyone who has followed its sports betting picks could have seen massive returns on betting sites. \nNew users can also target the DraftKings promo code, which offers $300 in bonus bets if your bet wins:Now that the 2026 Sony Open field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Sony Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the 2026 Sony Open: Henley, the betting favorite who begins at 12:54 p.m. ET in Round 1 on Thursday, stumbles and barely finishes inside the top 5. He's a golfer to avoid this week. The 2013 Sony Open champion hasn't been able to follow up on that success at this event with regularity. Since that time, he's missed the cut twice and has three other finishes outside the top 30. Last year, he finished T10. He's played just once since last year's playoffs and finished 19th at the Procore Championship, so the model doesn't love his value as a favorite this year. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: Ben Griffin, who is +1700, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. \"One of the best values on the board,\" McClure told SportsLine. \"My number is meaningfully shorter than the market, which is exactly what you want when laying a shorter outright.\" See who else to pick here. New users can also check out the latest FanDuel promo code and get $300 in bonus bets at FanDuel if your $5 bet wins:How to make 2026 Sony Open picksThe model's best bets also include five longshots of +3500 or higher in outright bets, including an enormous +40000 underdog. You can only see the model's picks here. \nWho will win the 2026 Sony Open, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

    "body": "\n        Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka received the top seeds in the upcoming Australian Open, the first major of 2026 in men's and women's tennis to kick-off a robust schedule. However, four-time grand slam champion Jannik Sinner (-125 at FanDuel Sportsbook) appears to be the favorite in the minds of others. The Italian is going for a three-peat in Melbourne after defeating Alexander Zverev and Daniil Medvedev in each of the last two Australian Open men's finals. Sabalenka had won consecutive grand slams at the Australian Open before American Madison Keys topped her in last year's finals in three sets. The world No. 1 on the women's side is the favorite (+180) ahead of Iga Swiatek (+550), Elena Rybakina (+750) and Americans Coco Gauff (+850) and Amanda Anisimova (+900). Sabalenka is gunning for her fifth career major after winning the US Open and coming in second at Wimbledon last year.Carlos Alcaraz, whose best career finish in Australia is a quarterfinal appearance, will have play his best to have a shot at squaring off with Sinner in another major final. Alcaraz has won seven of the last eight matchups between the titans, including three major finals culminating with his brilliant showing at the 2025 US Open.Where to watch Australian Open men's, women's singlesDate: Qualifying runs through Jan. 17; Main-draw play begins Jan. 18Location: Melbourne Park Sports and Entertainment Precinct -- Melbourne, AustraliaTV: ESPN, ESPN2 | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Note: Since Melbourne is 16 hours ahead of the Eastern Time zone in the United States, many matches will be shown live during the middle of the night. When individual match pairings are released for the main draw, keep that in mind while planning your viewing schedule.\nCan the American men break the streak?Andy Roddick is the most recent American to win a slam slam title on the men's side when he captured the 2003 US Open. Since, tennis has been dominated by three of the best players in history, including Novak Djokovic, who will appear in the Australian Open along with the emergence of Sinner and Alcaraz.Americans Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton, two of the top-10 players in the world, have been the most consistent pair over the last two years with big serves and increased precision during grand slams. Fritz's best major finish was a semifinal trip at Wimbledon last year while Shelton advanced to the semifinals in Melbourne.Aryna Sabalenka enters with razor-sharp focusSabalenka pocketed another Brisbane International title this month to send a warning shot to those in the Australian Open main draw -- she's out for blood. Sabalenka did not drop a set in her grand slam warmup and leads what should be a competitive field. Since winning the 2023 Australian Open for her first major title, Sabalenka and Polish standout Iga Swiatek have combined to take eight of the last 12 grand slams on the women's side. \"I'll do my best to go as far as possible,\" Sabalenka said.\nNovak Djokovic goes for 25th majorDjokovic, the fourth-ranked player in the world on the men's side, withdrew from the Australian Open tuneup tournament has not played an official match since November when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final of the Hellenic Championship. After that victory, Djokovic announced he was skipping ATP Finals with a shoulder injury and instead shifted his focus toward 2026's first grand slam.Djokovic is a 10-time Australian Open champion, last winning the tournament in 2023. He already holds the career lead with 24, and he nearly won that elusive 25th major on tour last year but came up short in the semifinals of all four events. Djokovic, 38, hinted at retirement last year after losing to Jannik Sinner in the French Open and his words following his US Open loss in September mirrored those remarks.It's clear, he wants to win one more grand slam before potentially untying his sneakers one final time as a professional athlete and one of the greatest players of all-time.\n\"Yeah, it will be very difficult for me in the future to overcome the hurdle of Sinner or Alcaraz in a best-of-5 in a grand slam,\" Djokovic said in September. \"I think I have a better chance best-of-3, but best-of-5 is tough. I'm not giving up on grand slams in that regard, having said that, I'm going to continue fighting and try to get to the finals and fight for an another trophy at least. But, you know, it's going to be a very difficult task.\"Coco Gauff eyes third career majorAfter claiming her fourth-straight win over Swiatek during the United Cup in Sydney, Gauff became the only player to have beaten the former world No. 1 four consecutive times in straight sets. The budding superstar on the American side has never won the Australian Open, but is not lacking confidence entering the first major of the year.The 21-year-old Gauff, who's ranked No. 4 in the world, took to Instagram after beating Swiatek and reposted a photo of a leaping two-handed backhand smash at the net, one of several impressive winners during the match.\n\"Def(initely) my favorite shot to hit. My version of a slam dunk lol. Not as climatic but still cool I think haha,\" Gauff wrote.Gauff won the French Open last year and Wimbledon in 2023. Her best finish down under was a semifinal loss to Sabalenka in 2024.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The home of former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, who died in a December plane crash, was burglarized around Jan. 7-8, according to the Associated Press. The alleged burglary was reported to the Iredell County Sheriff's Office on Jan. 8, and the Mooresville, North Carolina, home was last known to be secure on the afternoon of Jan. 7.According to the report, someone allegedly forced their way into the home and stole $30,000 in cash in addition to a backpack, guns and memorabilia. No one was home when the alleged crime occurred, and no arrests have been made although police are investigating.\"We're working the case,\" said Sheriff Darren Campbell. \"We are waiting on some digital evidence.\"On Dec. 18, Biffle was among six people killed in a plane crash at nearby Statesville Regional Airport. Three of Biffle's family members -- wife Emily and children Emma and Ryder -- also died in the accident. The plane took off from the airport around 10 a.m. before returning just 15 minutes later, when it crashed while attempting to land.\nAt this time, the exact cause of the crash is unknown. Biffle and two others on board had a pilot's license, but authorities are still uncertain about which one was flying the plane that day.\"NASCAR is devastated by the tragic loss of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, son Ryder, Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton in a fatal plane crash,\" NASCAR said in a lengthy statement. \"Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many. His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.\"\nBiffle, 55, totaled 515 races in his 16-year NASCAR Cup Series career. He piled up 19 wins and 175 top-10 finishes. Biffle competed numerous times for the Cup Series championship, and his best series finish came in 2005 when he finished second behind Tony Stewart.\n            ",

    "body": "\nWe're down to just eight teams in the NFL playoffs, and only four will remain after this weekend concludes. The action kicks off with two contests on Saturday, with both of the No. 1 seeds in the NFL in action. The Denver Broncos host the Buffalo Bills at 4:30 p.m. ET in the first game of the Divisional Round, while the Seattle Seahawks face the San Francisco 49ers for the third time this season in the prime time slot Saturday night at 8 p.m. ET. Here, we break down everything bettors need to know for these two matchups, including NFL betting lines and odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.Bills vs. Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET)\nThe Bills survived a close 27-24 matchup in Jacksonville to advance to the Divisional Round and a date with the No. 1 seed Broncos. Buffalo needed and got a big game from Josh Allen, who had 306 yards of offense and three total touchdowns against a Jaguars team that ranked No. 1 against the run this year. Allen and Co. face as much pressure as a No. 6 seed can face given there's no Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson or Joe Burrow in the AFC playoff field this year. Buffalo went 3-3 against playoff teams in the regular season before taking down the Jags in Jacksonville on Sunday.The Broncos took advantage of a down year from Mahomes and the Chiefs to go 14-3 and win the division and secure home-field advantage in the postseason. Denver ranked second in yards allowed and third in points allowed defensively but were more middle of the pack offensively at 14th in points scored. Bo Nix faces some pressure of his own as his numbers dipped a bit from his rookie season to 2025 despite the Broncos having a much better record than in 2024. Denver went 4-2 over playoff teams this season. The winner of this matchup will face the winner of the Houston Texans and New England Patriots, who face off on Sunday. If the Broncos win, they will host whichever team advances, while the Bills will be on the road no matter what should they win Saturday. This game is nearly a pick 'em, as the Broncos are just 1.5-point favorites at home, per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. The total is set at 46.5. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, leans Denver here as the Broncos win in 53% of simulations. The Bills are 9-9 against the spread this year, including the postseason, while the Broncos are 7-10 ATS. Buffalo is 9-9 to the Over this year while 10 of Denver's 17 games have finished Under, including each of its last two games.New users can bet the Broncos money line with the DraftKings promo code to receive $300 in bonus bets if your first bet wins:\n49ers vs. Seahawks (8 p.m. ET)\nThe NFC more than likely runs through the NFC West, as three of the four remaining teams in the conference come from the NFL's top division. One of those teams will be going home Saturday night while the other advances for a chance at the Super Bowl as the Seahawks host the 49ers in Seattle. These teams started the year against each other, with San Francisco getting a late touchdown and forcing a fumble for a 17-13 win in Seattle in Week 1. They also ended the year against one another, as the Seahawks dominated the 49ers' offense en route to a 13-3 win in Week 18 to secure the NFC West and the No. 1 seed. The 49ers have had a stellar season considering they have lost so much talent to injury. They were able to knock off the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles in Philly on Sunday, but they suffered yet another massive injury with George Kittle tearing his Achilles. Even more pressure now is on Christian McCaffrey as he is far and away the clear focal point for San Francisco's offense, and he had just 57 total yards against the Seahawks in Week 18 -- his lowest output of the 2025 season.  The Seahawks made a big gamble this offseason trading Geno Smith to Las Vegas and signing Sam Darnold in free agency. That move has paid off in a major way, as the Raiders are drafting first overall while the Seahawks won 14 games for the first time in franchise history while winning seven in a row to close out the year. The Seahawks have made the Super Bowl each of the first three times they had the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and they're hoping Darnold performs better in the postseason this year after he took nine sacks and had two giveaways in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams last season while starting for the Minnesota Vikings. The Seahawks are 7.5-point favorites at home against the 49ers, per DraftKings odds. The total sits at 45.5. The SportsLine model sees value in backing the 49ers as they win in 32% of simulations at plus money, but it also has the Seahawks covering the spread in more than 50% of simulations. Both teams have been great against the spread, with San Francisco 12-6 ATS and Seattle 12-5. Both teams lean towards the Over, too, with the 49ers 10-8 to the Over and the Seahawks 9-8, though both of the regular-season matchups between these teams this year finished Under this posted number.

    "body": "\n        The Africa Cup of Nations is set as Senegal will face Morocco on Sunday to determine the champion of the continent. Senegal were able to get past Egypt in the semifinals, while it took a penalty shootout for Morocco to book their place in the final in front of their home fans. Morocco got past Nigeria, who had been the top scoring team at AFCON, and it will set up quite a final on Sunday as the Atlas Lions look to win the tournament for the first time since 1976. They've been an extremely successful side at World Cups, but Morocco haven't even been runners-up at AFCON since 2004, but that could all change Sunday.How to watch Senegal vs. MoroccoDate: Sunday, Jan. 18 | Time: 2 p.m. ETLocation: Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium -- Rabat, MoroccoTV: beIN Sports | Live stream: Fubo (Try for free)How Senegal got hereAfter winning Group D by going undefeated during the group stage, Senegal had the joint best defensive record, allowing only one goal in group stage play. Pushing to the knockout stage, they were able to fend off Sudan before Mali's red card made advancing past the quarterfinals a breeze. Meeting Egypt, Senegal's defense were again strong, keeping Mohamed Salah in check en route to another shutout victory. Only allowing two goals at AFCON so far, keeper Edouard Mendy and the Senegal defense will be tough to break down as the nation look to secure their first AFCON title since 2021.How Morocco got hereLike Senegal, Morocco won Group A with an undefeated record, scoring six goals while only allowing one. Real Madrid man Brahim Diaz's goals were a large part of their success, but so was the return of Paris Saint-Germain right back Achraf Hakimi from injury, which has given them their leader back on the pitch. Called in without playing a minute of soccer for PSG this season, it was a risk bringing Hakimi, but he has hit the pitch as if he hasn't missed a step, which has been critical in the knockout stage for the Atlas Lions. They squeaked past Tanzania in the round of 16 before putting two goals past Cameroon. Coming up against Nigeria in the semifinals was quite a tall task for Morocco, but keeper Yassine Bounou was more than ready to play under pressure and secure their place in the final.Players to watchSenegal: All eyes will be on Sadio Mane, despite him being more of a creative presence during this tournament. When his team needed him most, Mane came up with a goal to defeat Egypt, but during the tournament as a whole, he has two goals and three assists. With Nicolas Jackson and Iliman Ndiaye being able to help pace the attack, less pressure has been on Mane to score in this tournament but he has been a critical part of the progression of Senegal's balanced attack. Facing Morocco in the final, while it will be a defense-first affair, this is a moment where stars like Mane will be looked upon.\nMorocco: Brahim Diaz will not only be looking to win AFCON, but he also enters as the leader in the Golden Boot race. With five goals so far in this tournament, it's clear where the Atlas Lions will look for their goals. He's gotten it done in plenty of different ways and will be looking to bounce back after Nigeria were able to keep him from making an impact in attack. Forward Ayoub El Kaabi of Olympiacos has been able to offer a secondary focus in the attack, but Diaz is still the first person that Morocco look to when they need a goal, and he'll need to be at his best to break down a stout Senegal defense. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Oregon quarterback Dante Moore announced Wednesday that he's returning to school for the 2026 season and will bypass this spring's NFL Draft. Moore was ranked as the No. 2 overall prospect and second quarterback behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza in CBS Sports' NFL Draft Prospect Rankings. Had Moore elected to enter his name in the 2026 NFL Draft, he was a clear top-10 pick -- and likely No. 2 overall choice by the New York Jets.Instead, Moore joined several other signal callers in the last 30 years who decided to bypass the opportunity to enter the draft to return to school. This year alone, Texas quarterback Arch Manning quietly turned down the chance to go first overall; some analysts think Manning would have been the No. 1 pick this spring, but the plan all along for Manning was to start at least two seasons at Texas. He will more than likely join Moore in the 2027 NFL Draft, where they can duel for top billing. While not all decisions are created equal, some have paid off more than others. Former Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck famously returned to school for his senior year instead of entering the draft. Despite doing that, Luck was selectedby the Indianapolis Colts with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft.While next year's NFL draft class projects to be more talent-rich at the top, Moore returning to school gives Oregon a solidified quarterback room heading into this fall. The Ducks landed a commitment earlier this month from former five-star quarterback Dylan Raiola, who transferred from Nebraska after his sophomore season. With Moore back, Raiola enters fall camp as the backup, which he is OK with. \n\n        \n            \n                Dante Moore, Dylan Raiola in the same Oregon QB room? It's possible Ducks use Nebraska transfer as 2026 backup\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn the topic of Moore's stunning decision, here are other examples of quarterbacks staying one more year in college football instead of entering the NFL Draft.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Peyton Manning, TennesseeWhere they were drafted: No. 1 (1998) | Career earnings: $247,714,000Manning was a notable example of a prominent player bypassing the draft to return to school. Manning shocked the college football world in 1997 by announcing he would be returning to Tennessee for his senior season. Still, Manning was selected by the Colts the following year with the No. 1 overall pick. Manning went on to become one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Matt Leinart, USCWhere they were drafted: No. 10 (2006) | Career earnings: $22,645,000After leading USC to the 2004 national title and winning that year's Heisman, it would have been logical for Leinart to enter his name in the draft. But when you're the toast of Los Angeles and taking classes like ballroom dancing, you can also see why Leinart wanted to return to school.\nLeinart and USC got this close to a three-peat, but lost to Texas in the BCS title game that year. Considering his final year saw Leinart amass even more national fame, score the winning touchdown at Notre Dame (in the Bush Push) and then share the field with other living legends in the greatest college football game of the modern era, he probably has no regrets. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Sam Bradford, OklahomaWhere they were drafted: No. 1 (2010) | Career earnings: $103,045,000Fresh off winning the Heisman in 2008 and finishing as the national champion runner-up, Bradford made the remarkable decision to run it back in 2009 at Oklahoma. It was a year to forget. Bradford appeared in only three games and underwent season-ending shoulder surgery after he re-injured his right shoulder against Texas. Still, Bradford was selected No. 1 overall by the Rams in 2010 and went on to earn over $100 million.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jake Locker, WashingtonWhere they were drafted: No. 8 (2011) | Career earnings: $12,586,002In 2009, Locker was selected in the tenth round of the MLB Draft. Still, he elected to stick with football and decline a contract. Locker accounted for 28 touchdowns during his redshirt junior season in 2009 and elected to return to school the following year. Locker was picked in the top 10 (No. 8 overall) in the 2011 NFL Draft.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Andrew Luck, StanfordWhere they were drafted: No. 1 (2012) | Career earnings: $97,107,998While Luck was eligible for the 2011 NFL Draft, he elected to remain at Stanford to complete his degree. Had he entered, Luck would have battled Cam Newton to be the No. 1 pick. Instead, Luck returned to Stanford for his redshirt junior season and led the Cardinal to an 11-2 record and finished as the Heisman runner-up to Robert Griffin III. Luck still went No. 1 overall the following year, topping RG3 at least in that regard. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Matt Barkley, USCWhere they were drafted: No. 98 (2013) | Career earnings: $7,849,113Barkley is the lone quarterback on the list who clearly erred in forgoing the draft. Barkley, who would've likely been a top 10 pick in 2012, returned to USC where he missed the end of the season due to a shoulder injury. Barkley was selected in the fourth round by the Eagles and spent most of his professional career on various practice squads.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Marcus Mariota, OregonWhere they were drafted: No. 2 (2015) | Career earnings: Active NFL playerAfter throwing for 3,665 yards and accounting for 40 touchdowns, Mariota decided to return to Oregon for his redshirt junior season. Mariota went on to win the Heisman Trophy during the 2014 campaign. Mariota led Oregon to the national title game in the first year of the four-team College Football Playoff, losing to Ohio State.

    "body": "\nJarran Reed doesn't hold back his feelings about the San Francisco 49ers. \"Me personally, don't like nothing about them,\" the Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle said Tuesday.On Saturday, Reed and the rest of the Seahawks will square off against the NFC West rival 49ers for the third time this season -- and the just time in three weeks -- when the teams collide in a NFC Divisional Round matchup at Lumen Field in Seattle. In the teams' season opener at Lumen Field, San Francisco won 17-13. But two weeks ago in the regular season finale in Santa Clara, Calif., the Seahawks prevailed 13-3 to win the NFC West and earn the No. 1 seed in the playoffs.This time, the stakes will be much more significant: Saturday's survivor will advance to the NFC Championship Game. \"We know what's at stake; they know what's at stake,\" Reed said. \"It's about getting out there between them lines and hitting it head-on, man-on-man, mano-y-mano.\"For Saturday, Seattle is a seven-point favorite at DraftKings over the 49ers.Seahawks vs. 49ers odds\nOpening spread: Seahawks -6.5 (-115)Opening money line:  Seahawks -305, 49ers +245Opening total: 47.5This line has risen from its initial opening and even touched -7.5 at DraftKings. But note: In both of the previous meetings this season, the road team has been favored, won outright and covered against the spread. In Week 1, San Francisco was a 3.5-point favorite in Seattle and won by four. Just two weeks ago in Santa Clara, Seattle was a 2.5-point favorite and won by 10.In addition, the Under hit in each of the last three meetings dating back to last season. The total was 42.5 in Week 1 when the teams combined for 30 points and 48.5 in Week 18 when the teams combined for just 16. That may be the reason why the total for the Divisional Round matchup has dropped after opening at 47.5.Seahawks betting profile\nOpening win total: 7.5 wins  W/L record: 14-3ATS record: 12-5O/U record: 9-8Believers in the Seahawks did well in 2025. Seattle's 12-5 record against the spread during the regular season was tied with the Patriots for the best such record in the NFL. In addition, the Seahawks easily cleared their preseason win total clinching Over 7.5 wins in Week 12. They also enter the playoffs on a roll, having won seven in a row straight-up. They were favorites in each of those seven games.However, Seattle has struggled in the postseason recently. The Seahawks are 0-3 straight-up and against the spread in their last three playoff games. They also are 1-3 straight-up and against-the-spread against divisional opponents in the postseason since 2000.49ers betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 13-5ATS record: 11-7O/U record: 10-8Despite battling a mind-boggling number of injuries to key players this season, San Francisco somehow managed to go Over their preseason total of 10.5 wins. The 49ers also are 7-1 straight-up and 6-2 against the spread over their last eight games, but that includes the loss to the Seahawks in the regular season finale.San Francisco has enjoyed tremendous success against Seattle at Lumen Field recently. The 49ers have won their last four games straight-up against the Seahawks in Seattle, covering in all four games as well. To be fair, San Francisco was favored in each of those games. The 49ers are also 4-1 against the spread all-time against divisional opponents in the postseason and 7-0 straight-up (and 6-1 against-the-spread) in the Divisional Round in the last 20 seasons.Seahawks-49ers prop pick: Brock Purdy Under 230.5 passing yards\nThis number has dropped to 227.5 at some places, so there's some value here. When the 49ers met the Seahawks two weeks ago, Purdy didn't get close to this number, completing 19-of-27 passes for 127 yards. And now he will be without injured tight end George Kittle, who had five catches for 29 yards in that game.On Saturday, Purdy will face arguably the best pass defense in the league. Seattle led the NFL in yards per attempt (6.0) and yards per catch (9.7). The defense also ranked fourth in passer rating (77.9) and 10th in passing yards per game (193.9). Only one opposing quarterback in the Seahawks' last six games, the Rams' Matthew Stafford, has gone Over this number.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After more than three decades of seeing Christian Laettner's buzzer-beating game-winner in Duke's win vs. Kentucky in the 1992 Elite Eight replayed on national TV, it must have been nice for UK fans to be on the winning side of a similar play. But Malachi Moreno's turnaround jumper at the final horn was only part of the story from the Wildcats' 75-74 win at LSU on Wednesday. UK dug itself a 19-3 hole and trailed by as much as 18 in the second half before rallying to win a road tilt featuring plenty of tension for both teams.Kentucky (10-6, 2-2 SEC) would likely have fallen to First Four Out territory in CBS Sports Bracketology with a loss. Instead, the Wildcats are expected to rise from a No. 11 seed to a No. 10 seed. LSU (12-5, 0-4) needed a win to get onto the right side of the bubble and to alleviate some of the mounting pressure on fourth-year coach Matt McMahon.In a battle between desperate league foes figuring out life without injured starting point guards, it was Kentucky that found a way in the end. So how did the Wildcats surge back from their second straight abysmal start for their second straight win?\nHere's the anatomy of a comeback that may go down as a season-saver for Kentucky.Riding the star guardsKentucky coach Mark Pope rode his star guards in the second half, keeping Otega Oweh and Denzel Aberdeen on the floor for all 20 minutes as the Wildcats sought to replicate a formula that worked for them on Saturday in a 92-68 win over Mississippi State.In that win over the Bulldogs, which featured a similarly ugly start, the duo combined for 38 points, including 23 in the second half. Oweh and Aberdeen were encouragingly efficient (15 of 26 from the field) in that game. But could they stack back-to-back strong performances? Early on at LSU, the answer appeared to be a resounding no.\nOweh missed his first four shots as Kentucky got bogged down in directionless half court possessions against the Tigers. But he bounced back to finish 6 of 13 from the field and 6 of 10 from the free-throw line. Of Oweh's game-high 21 points, 15 came after halftime. All 17 of Aberdeen's points came after halftime as the duo combined to hit 5 of 7 attempts from beyond the arc.\nEven before this week's announcement from Pope that starting point guard Jaland Lowe will miss the rest of the season because of a lingering shoulder injury, the Wildcats needed more from Oweh and Aberdeen. They are finally getting it.More Williams and MorenoSix of Kentucky's 10 most-effective two-man combinations against high-major opposition entering Wednesday night involved Kam Williams. Pope must have seen the data, because he finally put the sophomore wing in the starting lineup against LSU for the first time since Dec. 5. Though he scored just five points, Williams continued to provide a critical element of floor-spacing while logging 16 minutes in the second half.\nThe Tulane transfer also provided a massive defensive lift with his steal and flush that gave Kentucky its first lead of the game with just under four minutes remaining.\nWilliams was key in lifting UK out of a slow start against Mississippi State on Saturday and continues to look like the sort of connector piece the Wildcats need to keep things moving offensively. Williams also gives Pope some lineup versatility, as he's big enough to play in a small-ball four role.Moreno has reentered the starting lineup for the past two games amid the absence of Jayden Quaintance. While the status of Quaintance, a center with potential first-round NBA Draft potential, remains an uncertainty, Moreno continues to blossom. The freshman seven-footer finished with 10 points, eight rebounds and one memorable buzzer-beater against LSU.\nThe No. 27 overall prospect from the Class of 2025 is a local product from nearby Georgetown, Kentucky, who looks like a potential long-term building block for Pope. Even if Quaintance can't consistently be part of the UK rotation, the Wildcats have a great alternative with Moreno who could factor in to the future in a way that Quaintance likely won't.Andrija Jelavic gets a startThere wasn't much underlying data to suggest that Croatian newcomer Andrija Jelavic's performance warranted a promotion to the starting lineup. But the 6-foot-11 stretch big played well in his first career start, finishing with 11 points and five rebounds. He was on the floor for 11 straight minutes to begin the second half as UK trimmed a 16-point halftime deficit to six.We'll see whether Jelavic remains a fixture in the starting lineup from here on out for Kentucky, but he was good enough against the Tigers to deserve another opportunity. His increased role has come with a price for others.\nWith Jelavic and Moreno heavily featured against LSU, Brandon Garrison logged just five minutes in the second half. One game after logging a season-low 13 minutes against Mississippi State, Mo Dioubate set another season-low with just 12 minutes. During UK's two-game SEC winning streak, the uncomfortable truth is that the Wildcats have been better with those two former starters in reduced roles. While both bring physicality in the frontcourt, neither are particularly skilled on offense.With Lowe out and Kentucky struggling to execute in half-court situations, the floor-stretching ability of Jelavic and Williams -- along with Moreno's development as a passer -- is forcing Pope to reimagine how he allots minutes.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        A new arrival in a strange land, Martin Zubimendi is already in the midst of the best goalscoring season of his career. With Wednesday's decisive strike in Arsenal's 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge, the Spaniard reached four for the season, hardly Erling Haaland numbers but not to be sniffed at for a nominal defensive midfielder.\nIt is a role, however, that looks increasingly nominal. The sense that there might be a lot more to come doesn't just come from the smattering of DM-ish goals, smart strikes from space around the edge of the box. It is that Arsenal are building a platform to allow Zubimendi to do much more than dictate possession and smash a few in from range.Mikel Arteta is intent on giving him more. \"When we talk about Zubi, what else can he do?\" He asked. \"He can do whatever he wants. It's a bit similar to Declan [Rice]'s qualities.\"We just have to keep unlocking that in his system, in his brain, because he's so good at occupying different spaces, he's carrying the ball, dribbling, winning duels, and he has a talent when he gets into the final third and into the box. He's so composed. He sees the picture very clear.\"\nMore even than that, he seems to see what Rice and Martin Odegaard see too. That much is apparent in one of the most impressive new wrinkles in Arsenal's game over recent weeks, runs from Zubimendi that flip the midfield, a classic 4-3-3 inverted as the nominal sitter gets up close near to the striker.It started innocuously enough in the Chelsea game. A goal kick and Arsenal line up in relatively standard fashion, their center backs split with both Zubimendi and Rice offering interior passing options. Odegaard, however, spots space behind Enzo Fernandez and rather fancies investigating that. It would appear that then Zubimendi spots his captain's movement and concludes that there'll be space vacated upfield for him to attack. It's more of a steady creep out of build up than an explosive sprint but it is spotted by the rest of his team mates, who get in cycle.\n                                                                    EFL\n                                                            Much of what follows happens off screen but as Zubimendi pushes up, Leandro Trossard moves into an interior space, something that might approximate the left eight spots Rice usually pops up in. That has the added advantage of enabling Viktor Gyokeres to drift into the left channel spots where he has looked so effective -- and this was one of his most impressive performances in an Arsenal shirt to date -- with Zubimendi to fill it.\nA loose long ball from Gabriel, one that looked to be aimed in Zubimendi's direction, threatened to kill the move but as ever Jurrien Timber was live to a potential breakdown. He flicked it to Trossard who immediately knew what to do with it. And that is how, seven passes after he'd been hovering around in the DM spots, Zubimendi finds himself chasing a ball in behind, a cry of hope rising up from the away end.\n                                                                    EFL\n                                                            On this occasion nothing comes from the dart. Wesley Fofana has the recovery pace to put him off and Zubimendi's footing is not sure on a poor Stamford Bridge field. Arsenal, however, are trying this often. Even earlier in the game, he had gone on a gallivant when Bukayo Saka dropped deep to receive a pass. Fernandez switched off and that opened up a channel down the right. It should have resulted in more but Zubimendi's low pass from the right channel was a little behind Gyokeres, who did well to swivel out of danger and get a shot away.Still, barely a game goes by of late where you don't find yourself asking \"how did Zubimendi end up there?\" Not that this is necessarily reinventing the tactical wheel. Arsenal's fluid midfield three often starts passages of play looking like a double pivot, in those circumstances it is perfectly normal for one of the two deep-lying midfielders to push up and join the forwards. What is intriguing is how quickly this team has concluded that its new signing can stretch his legs, driving up field in pursuit of spaces no one would expect him to fill.\nThis movement from Zubimendi also serves another purpose. Arsenal supporters have often been frustrated by Odegaard's proclivity to drop deeper than they might expect from one of their finest ball strikers, a midfielder who has delivered multiple seasons of double digit scoring. This is not the forum to debate that -- though it's hard to shake the sense that he and his team would be even better if Odegaard were to stay higher more often -- not least because Arsenal have mitigated the problems that come with that. If Odegaard doesn't fill the space, Zubimendi does.That might even prove to be a virtue made from a problem. It will be some time yet before defenders stop tracking a ball-striker of Odegaard's quality. If he can drag them out of position then it opens gaps for Zubimendi, who might just find he is not being tracked all that diligently by the opposition's more advanced midfielder.Zubimendi has license to push on and Arsenal are finding him. Before the start of December he averaged 0.88 touches in the penalty area per 90 minutes, a shade below his career average. Since the start of last month that number has skyrocketed to 1.95. Those aren't quite the same numbers that Rice is getting, let alone Odegaard, but that isn't really the point. It is far more than anyone should reasonably expect from the nominal sitting midfielder. And look at where those touches are landing, the most dangerous areas around the penalty area. His ghosting into prime areas is Banquoian. \nAction points around the attacking penalty area for Martin Zubimendi in all competitions since December 1 \n                                                                    TruMedia\n                                                            At no stage has this movement been quite as effective as for Zubimendi's goal in the 4-1 win over Aston Villa to round out 2025. Initially Arsenal's No.36 finds himself in an advanced position because he has pushed up to press Youri Tielemans off a risky pass infield by right back Lamine Bogarde. His pressure pays off but what stands out most is how Zubimendi reacts when the ball lands with Odegaard. He doesn't need to hesitate, to assess his options or track back. He just goes. For a second Tielemans considers following him having already concluded that Viktor Gyokeres will have to be someone else's problem. Ultimately the Belgian sees Odegaard driving in his direction and naturally concludes that that is the biggest danger. He can't stop it though, the Arsenal skipper driving a pass between the Villa center backs for Zubimendi to poke home.How many more goals might we see like that? Maybe not a lot. Before too long teams could just adjust to take Zubimendi's runs into the frontline away from Arsenal. Perhaps when Odegaard drops the defensive assignments switch or maybe the opposition are just prepared to live with the risk posed by an opponent with 18 career goals. If Arteta wants to drop back his best attacking midfielder to push on his sitter, that sounds like something a few coaches might just allow him to do.\nIt doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. What does is that Zubimendi, Odegaard and Rice have started just nine games together and already they are playing like they have been together for years, one going and the other sitting in a fashion that any England fan can attest usually makes more sense in theory than in practice. For now Odegaard and Zubimendi are interchanging in such a way as to get the latter runs into the box. If and when teams take that away, it would be fair to assume that Arsenal will alight on something else.That in itself is a particular credit to Zubimendi. It is only five months ago that he began life playing probably the most difficult position in football in the most difficult league in the sport. Already he has so mastered it that fresh ways must be found for the new arrival to test himself. Imagine what damage he might cause when he has well and truly settled into the strange world of the Premier League.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        In an ongoing trend of talent departures from league to league, WSL in England has pried another one of the National Women's Soccer League's prime players.In a move that adds more gasoline to the raging fires of pro league debates, Manchester City announced they have signed U.S. women's national team midfielder and former Portland Thorns captain, Sam Coffey, on Wednesday. Coffey departs the NWSL on a three-and-a-half-year deal through 2029 with the WSL side. The transfer is reportedly worth $875,000.While Coffey had two years remaining on her Thorns contract, the player was often transparent about her lifelong dream to one day play in Europe. She echoed the sentiment in a farewell video, referring to the move as something she \"simply has to pursue.\"\nWhat does it mean for Portland?There was an argument that during the tempestuous 2024 season, the Thorns' return to the 2024 playoff appearance was fueled by forward Sophia Wilson's undeniable offensive production in front of the goal. A similar debate could paint Coffey as the catalyst for the Thorns' elevated run in 2025. \nThe 27-year-old midfielder captained the Thorns to the 2025 NWSL semifinals and led the team in minutes played. She was a crucial component in Portland's midfield and was a central leadership figure for the club following retirements by Christine Sinclair, Becky Sauerbrunn, and Meghan Klingenberg. Coffey leaves the NWSL club a 2022 NWSL Championship winner and earned three NWSL Best XI selections (2022, 2023, 2025).Her departure exposes an immediate gap in the midfield, but it's just another question lingering around the club as it builds towards the 2026 season. There are also the bigger holes Coffey's absence will leave behind in terms of leadership, on-field performance, and off-pitch efforts.\"While the Thorns organization did everything it could to keep Sam in Portland, we thought it was important to support her ambitions while we continue building a team capable of competing for championships. We are grateful for her contributions and wish her success as she pursues her next opportunity,\" said president and general manager of soccer operations Jeff Agoos.\nIn the early days of the new year, Portland have just four midfielders listed on their current preseason roster. Venezuela international Deyna Castellanos, Canadian international Jessie Fleming, Olivia Moultrie, and the recently signed Shae Harvey out of Stanford University. There's the possibility that the 10 forwards currently on the preseason roster may fluctuate positionally, but that is an immediate conundrum for whoever the next Thorns' head coach will be.What does it mean for Manchester City and WSL?The move symbolizes the shift of power club dynamics in England between Chelsea FC, Arsenal, and Manchester City. Kerolin, the former 2023 NWSL MVP, who joined Manchester City in January 2025, was another domino to fall in favor of the Chelsea rivals, shortly following Vivianne Miedema's arrival at the club in July 2024 from Arsenal on a free transfer.Coffey's arrival only boosts the international power on the roster as she joins Kerolin, Miedema, Bunny Shaw, and Yui Hasegawa, among others. Manchester City currently control the WSL table with 33 points, with six points over Chelsea and 10 points ahead of Arsenal. \n\"Sam's reputation as one of the world's best speaks for itself, and we're delighted she's chosen to come here ahead of other potential suitors,' said City's director of women's football Therese Sjogran.\"We believe she has all the qualities needed to thrive at City and, more broadly, the WSL, and we're excited to see how she can elevate our already superb squad of players. Sam is playing at the top of her game, and I think her decision to come here shows the incredible progress we've made as a Club and the ambitions we have moving forward.\"There's no doubt Manchester City are now the team to chase on the table, and now they have to maintain the expectations they've set for themselves.\nThe NWSL will be fineA year ago, after Naomi Girma's departure, I claimed the NWSL would be fine, and I still mean it. But after repeated movement, even I'll admit my own sentiment behind it has shifted. The thing about Coffey's departure is mostly its timing. Ultimately, it was a move that was going to happen once the right opportunity came along. She's been as open and honest about how playing in Europe is a dream of hers, and the transparency does the NWSL a big service. If anything, it'll allow NWSL to commit to the messaging that this was ultimately what the player wanted. It also brings an entire year full circle in which the league lost multiple U.S. national team players and plenty of its league starting-level players. \nRising transfer fees, which some English clubs can offer with the resources of their men's clubs, have tipped the player movement scale. Over the last year, the league has struggled to grapple with its own identity in a search for financial mechanisms, like salary cap restrictions in the name of competitive parity. The playing level the NWSL views as one of assets, if not its greatest. The introduction of a \"High-Impact Player\" rule, voted on by the board in December, hasn't exactly resolved anything either. The HIP rule was a partial response to the ongoing contract saga with Trinity Rodman, another player the league has failed to re-sign at the moment. There was a deal in place in December between the winger and the Washington Spirit, which was a four-year deal that included backloaded portions of her contract. NWSL Commissioner Jessica Berman vetoed the contract, claiming the potential new contract violated the spirit of league rules. Rodman is currently unattached to any club as the season looms closer. \nThe new HIP mechanism allows teams to spend an additional $1 million on players who meet specific \"star\" criteria. The ability to offer competitive salaries, as the global transfer market rises, remains a hurdle for the women's leagues around the world, though the NWSL specifically has seen an increase in players leaving for teams overseas. NWSL clubs will be able to exceed the league's current salary cap by $1 million and use the HIP funds toward single or multiple player contracts. The HIP threshold will also increase annually alongside the salary cap, which is currently $3.5 million and set to rise to $5.1 million by 2030. No player has been signed utilizing the new rule since it was approved, though Denver Summit FC recently announced they signed USWNT midfielder Lindsey Heaps and alluded to the possibility of using the mechanism when she arrives midseason.\nThe NWSL Players Association recently filed a grievance challenging the NWSL \"High Impact Player\" rule. The NWSLPA is seeking immediate rescission of the rule, claiming \"a player compensation rule implemented without bargaining and in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and federal labor law.\"However, in the case of Coffey, you can never actually veto personal ambition. Now the league is in the midst of losing an identity that it never cemented in the first place. If you're the league of parity it is because you have talent on the rosters to claim that. The NWSL is well on its way to becoming a league of trends, instead of innovation.Once upon a time, there was an allocation system that distributed and paid the contracts of USWNT, Canada, and Mexico internationals to NWSL clubs, then those partnerships shifted as the league grew. In an attempt for more control in roster building, allocation money was introduced for 2020, then its expiration date was issued, and now it's sort of back in a larger, separate, more exclusive amount, as HIP money. \nOne of the HIP rule criteria a player can meet is \"marketability,\" a metric measured by whether or not a player is on SportsPro Media's Top 150 most marketable players, a list that somehow favors European players. It is perhaps the trend the NWSL is failing to escape the most. Though trends have always been part of the league. Once, NWSL was the home of several Australian women's national team members, and now it is the home of multiple Brazilian players. It once promised to trend towards more women in head coaching positions, and there will now be three in 2026 instead of two as the league expands to 16 teams. There's even a new trend of former MLS coaches in the league, with Denver's Nick Cushing and Kansas City's Chris Armas hired this offseason.Trends fade and become memories. Sometimes they are recalled when true innovation is lacking, and the need for some kind of inspiration is necessary. While they come and go, it's still what NWSL audiences, new and old, will keep an eye on.\nHopefully, the loss of a homegrown captain in her prime is a clear enough signal that retaining its USWNT assets will be the league's defining challenge of the moment. Over recent years, it's been facility infrastructure, resources, and match schedule management. As the league changes, the challenges it faces will change too. From Girma to Kerolin, even to players whose moves haven't quite worked out in Crystal Dunn and Jenna Nighswonger, you cannot deny that the most pressing challenge is the imbalance of players leaving to competing leagues versus incoming players from those same leagues. Alongside losing multiple players to overseas competition, the league has mostly failed to lure overseas talent to the NWSL, at least at the rate players have left overseas in one year.  I do still believe the NWSL will be fine, but what league that is proclaiming to be the best in the world wants to be just fine?The USWNT will be better than fineCoffey's departure overseas now adds another starting caliber U.S. women's national team player abroad. Alongside Emily Fox, Girma, and Heaps, that makes four players who have been regulars across starting lineups for head coach Emma Hayes since her managerial arrival ahead of the Paris Olympics in 2024. You add in Catarina Macario, Alyssa Thompson, and Phallon Tulis-Joyce, who have been consistent features in the starting XI in just 2025 alone, that builds up to seven players. And if you're the type that loves a \"this young athlete is ready to start right now' debate, you can consider Lily Yohannes as the eighth USWNT player.That would mean more than half of a starting caliber lineup for the USWNT plays their club soccer overseas. Removing NWSL from that equation, the national team is going be better than fine or even OK. Concacaf rivals might be back to fearing the Stars and Stripes once again in the months leading up to the World Cup qualifiers in November.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the most exciting players in nation takes the field on Wednesday night, and on a night with only two college football games on the schedule, this is a chance for fans of playmaking running backs to learn about Cam Cook. The junior running back for Jacksonville State leads the nation with 832 rushing yards, and largely due to his dominant season thus far, the SportsLine model is backing Gamecocks to defeat Delaware as one of its Wednesday best bets. Jacksonville State and Delaware kick off at 7 p.m. ET, which is one of the earliest games on a busy Wednesday sports calendar that includes college football, MLB playoffs, NHL games and NBA preseason action, and the model projects Cook to rush for more than 120 yards on Wednesday.Cook has rushed for at least 120 yards in four of six games this season, including 218 yards last week against Sam Houston. Speaking of Sam Houston, the model likes the Sam Houston Bearkats to answer last week's loss against Jacksonville State with a victory over UTEP as part of its Wednesday best bets. Both Jacksonville State and Sam Houston are underdogs this week, but the model projects them both to win in over 60% of simulations, making the money line the go-to option, rather than betting against the spread. The model also has a best bet on the NHL, backing Over 5.5 goals in Red Wings vs. Panthers, with the puck dropping at 7 p.m. ET.Click here to bet today's games with the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $300 in free bets if your first $5 bet wins.Whether you're looking into MLB betting, college football betting, NHL betting or anything else on the Wednesday sports schedule, there are a number of online sports betting options, and our team can help point you in the right direction.

However, UTEP's offense has been about as unproductive as Sam Houston's defense, with the Miners ranking 129th in scoring offense (14 ppg). They've scored just 19 points (9.5 ppg) in two Conference USA games this season, as they are 0-2 in conference play. Sam Houston is 0-3 in Conference USA competition, but two of those three games came on the road, and they've had a tough early-season conference schedule, playing both schools that competed in last year's conference championship game. UTEP lost both of its conference games at home. Sam Houston will host UTEP on Wednesday, and the model projects the Bearkats to win in 64% of simulations. Bet it at FanDuel, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Game: Delaware vs. Jacksonville State (Wednesday, 7 p.m. ET)The Pick: Jacksonville State (+124) to winThe defending Conference USA champions are home underdogs, despite being 2-0 in conference play compared to Delaware's 1-1 mark in the league. Delaware is coming off a 27-24 loss to Western Kentucky on Oct. 3, so they do have the advantage of coming off a bye with more time to prepare, but the model still projects Jacksonville State's talent to show off at home. Led by Cam Cook, a TCU transfer who has immediately become an integral part of the Gamecocks' offense, Jacksonville State is fifth in the nation in rushing at 269.8 yards per game on 5.4 yards per rush, which ranks 14th. Jacksonville State is averaging 27 ppg over two contests since freshman dual-threat quarterback Caden Creel took over the offense, and Creel has 531 combined passing and rushing yards (265.5 per game) over his two contests playing extended snaps. Meanwhile, Delaware is in its first year as an FBS team, moving up from the FCS. The model projects Jacksonville State to win in 70% of simulations. FanDuel offers the best odds on this play as well, and new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:More college football best betsEvery college football game simulated 10,000 timesSportsLine expert reveals his Week 8 college football predictionsWednesday NHL best betsGame: Florida Panthers vs. Detroit Red Wings (Wednesday, 7 p.m. ET)The Pick: Over 5.5 goals (-125)The last two Panthers games have gone Over this total, with Florida winning 6-2 over Ottawa on Saturday before falling to the Flyers, 5-2, on Monday. The Panthers have scored multiple goals in all four games this season, led by Brad Marchand and Anton Lundell with two goals and two assists each. Marchand, a four-time All-Star, has more than 50 points in 10 straight seasons as a consistent offensive threat. Meanwhile, the Red Wings have gone Over this total in two of three games this year. Patrick Kane, who had 59 points in 72 games last season and has been one of the league's better offensive players throughout his 19-year career, has a goal and three assists through three games.

    "body": "\n        UFC CEO Dana White has promised to kick off the promotion's new deal with Paramount in a big way. White now says the debut card in the new deal, which begins in January, could be anchored by lightweight champion Ilia Topuria.Speaking with reporters after Tuesday's episode of Dana White's Contender Series, White said the matchmaking process for the Paramount debut began \"literally today.\" \"Matchmaking was today, and we started working on the first Paramount card today,\" White continued.Many of the biggest potential stars the UFC could book, such as Jon Jones and Conor McGregor, have focused their pitches for their next fight on the planned UFC card at the White House in June. Not that a fighter couldn't fight on both the Paramount debut and again nearly half a year later at the White House, but Jones and McGregor are unique stars whose schedules have not operated in the same way as \"normal\" fighters for many years. Not to mention that McGregor has not fought since 2021 and is serving a suspension for violating the UFC's anti-doping policy that does not end until March, taking him completely off the table.\n        \n            \n                UFC lightweight division in 2025: Where things stand with Ilia Topuria, Paddy Pimblett and more at 155 pounds\n                \n                    Brian Campbell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nTopuria (17-0) is one star who is available and not currently scheduled for a fight.\nTopuria has stormed through his opponents, winning the featherweight championship with a knockout of Alexander Volkanovski in February 2024 and defending the belt the following October by knocking out Max Holloway. Seeking further glory, Topuria vacated his title to jump to lightweight, where he scored his third consecutive knockout in a title fight, beating Charles Oliveira to capture the vacant championship at 155 pounds.When asked about the idea of Topuria headlining the Paramount debut, White said, \"It's a possibility.\"White also spoke about the end of the promotion's deal with ESPN, promising to continue delivering the best product he can as the deal winds through its final months.\n\"We're always going to try to put on the best cards that we can,\" White said. \"We've had a great relationship with ESPN, and we were talking earlier, everybody is already starting to feel it. There's a lot of relationships between the ESPN team that comes to all the fights and works and the UFC team, and everybody is starting to feel it coming to the end here. They've been great to us, and they've been great to the sport. We want to put on a badass last card for them.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Welcome to Wednesday one and all. The international break is done and dusted and club football is right around the corner, both men's and women's. First up, it's the UEFA Women's Champions League on Wednesday and Thursday before the men's European club game starts up again. Before that, though, let's chat some USMNT. I'm James Benge. Let's go.📺 Footy fixAll times U.S./EasternWednesday, Oct. 15🇪🇺 Champions League: Lyon vs. St Polten, 12:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network🇪🇺 Champions League: Roma vs. Barcelona, 3 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+🏆 CONCACAF Champions Cup: Washington Spirit vs. Monterrey, 6:15 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network🏆 CONCACAF Champions Cup: Orlando Pride vs. Pachuca, 8:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo NetworkThursday, Oct. 16🇪🇺 Champions League: Atletico Madrid vs. Manchester United, 12:45 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network🇪🇺 Champions League: Bayern Munich vs. Juventus, 3 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network🏆 CONCACAF Champions Cup: Vancouver Rise vs. Alianza, 10 p.m. ➡️ Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network⚽ The Forward Line🇺🇸 Pochettino finds depth after Pulisic injury in Australia win\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            This is all starting to motor along quite nicely, isn't it? If Friday's 1-1 draw with Ecuador showed the benefits of the 3-4-2-1 system then a come from behind win over Australia suggested that Mauricio Pochettino has a fair few options to plug into it. Six changes from the last starting lineup soon became seven after an early injury to Christian Pulisic, who suffered a suspected hamstring injury. Losing their best player is not something any manager would want, but in a friendly game it does at least allow the US to answer a question that they'd really rather not be addressing for the first time at the World Cup: who steps up if a key man goes down? The answer, on the basis of this game, is quite a few players.\nMost of all, what had long looked to be the problem position of the US setup could now be at least a spot where Pochettino does not have to worry himself too much. Haji Wright made sure of that, building on his outstanding form with Coventry City in the EFL Championship by scoring both goals on his first start under the current coaching setup. Folarin Balogun had thrown the gauntlet down for the other contenders with his performance against Ecuador. Wright responded and, as Pardeep Cattry noted in her dispatch from Commerce City, the real winner might be their head coach.Cattry: \"While Balogun may have had a chance to stake his claim first on a starting role, Wright's performance on Tuesday just might create a sense of competition that has been missing in that particular position for years – and exemplifies the competitive edge Pochettino has fostered within the expanded player pool, a year into the job.\"You suspect the No.9 jersey will be Balogun's to lose for the time being. After all, it was the Monaco man who was given the run out against the toughest opposition. Still it is no great problem to have Wright waiting in the wings. The same is probably true of Cristian Roldon, who provided the assist for both of the US' goals last night. The 30-year-old was sidelined after featuring in the 2023 Gold Cup and you'd have to go even further back than that, probably to before the last World Cup, for the last time Roldon had a look in at a spot in the USMNT's strongest XI.Again, that might not have changed off the back of this friendly and a sprightly display against Japan last month. But Pochettino has made clear that he has no issue picking the best that MLS has to offer and that might just include Roldon, who will be looking to rival the likes of Tanner Tessman, Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah for a spot next to Tyler Adams next summer. That is some pretty robust depth there, the sort that didn't seem to be emerging in the early days of Pochettino's tenure. Now the Argentine feels there is time to pick and choose, to see which combinations work and who might be the blocks on whom he builds next summer.\nPochettino: \"We've still a long time to the World Cup. It's open to every single USA player playing here or outside this country. They need to feel that. They need to feel the confidence from us, that when they come we're going to provide the possibility to play and show their quality... We have time to decide. This type of roster provided the possibility to see the combinations and assess in different ways.\"All in all, then, an extremely successful international break. It would be unwise to get carried away just yet, certainly not when next month could bring a Uruguayan-shaped reality check on where the USMNT stand against the upper mid tier of international teams. Still the system is bedded in and has proven itself able to deal with shocks. That is not a bad place to be as 2025 approaches its end.Matchday 2 Today & Tomorrow!🔗  Midfield Link Play🇪🇺 Week two of the Champions League brings pressure for WSL\n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            The first league phase of the women's Champions League is very much up and running and with a condensed six game schedule there really is no time like the present for some of Europe's biggest names to get results. That is particularly the case for two-thirds of the WSL contingent, who did not get the results they wanted last week. Even the other is about to face what could be a serious test of their aspirations.Holders Arsenal got their title defense up and running in exactly the wrong sort of fashion, an absorbing game against Lyon going the way of the visitors thanks to a fine double from Melchie Dumornay. Up next is a return to Lisbon, where the Gunners beat Barcelona to claim their second European crown, but this time they will be at Benfica's Estadio Da Luz. The Eagles are heavy underdogs but pushed Juventus close in the first round of games and will believe they can trouble Renee Slegers' side, whose slump in form only partially eased with a 1-0 win over Brighton on Sunday.\nBefore they play on Thursday it is the turn of another London side who should be aspiring for the top four and a bye to the quarterfinals. Chelsea did their chances of achieving that no favors with a draw away to Twente, one of several games this season where their finishing has deserted them. Twenty shots worth over three expected goals resulted only in Sandy Baltimore's 71st minute equaliser, a rough start to a fixture list that will get plenty tougher in the second half of the league phase. At home to Paris FC, Sonia Bompastor wants to see her side bear their teeth.Bompastor: \"If you look at the stats from our last six games, we are really good in possession, we are bringing the ball high up the pitch, bringing it into the box in different ways but the most difficult thing in football is to score goals. We need to stay confident and keep trying. Sometimes, when you're able to be clinical, you kill the opposition's hope a bit sooner.\"Meanwhile the only one of the English teams to win in the first round of games face what might be the most intriguing clash of the second. Manchester United have been in freescoring form in the WSL this season with 16 goals in four wins and two draws. Set against them is an Atletico Madrid whose six goal drubbing of St Polten put them in the middle of a Spanish one, two, three at the top of the Champions League table. Fiamma has looked an exceptional striker in Spain and the Champions League this season, will she and her teammates be able to outscore the likes of Melvin Malard and Jess Park? With home advantage, you'd make Atleti slight favorites.🔗  Top Stories📺 How to follow UWCL: Want to keep up with all the drama of this week's Champions League games?

    "body": "\n        Hard to believe, but we're already in the middle of October and on the doorstep of Week 7 in the NFL. This is the period where teams start to separate from one another and either prove that they are a playoff threat or are building toward 2026 if they fall by the wayside. Through the first chunk of the year, upsets have been a common theme, including in Week 6. There, we accurately predicted that the Seahawks would upset the Jaguars on the road. Meanwhile, Monday night saw a pair of upsets with the Falcons taking down the Bills and the Bears outlasting the Commanders. Where will the upsets come in Week 7? Let's try and sift through all the madness and identify a handful of favorites that could be ripe for an upset. NFL odds courtesy of FanDuel Sportsbook.

You can get started here:Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Detroit Lions (-5.5)\nWhen: Monday, 7 p.m. ET | Where: Ford Field (Detroit)TV: ESPN | Stream: (Fubo, try for free)Buccaneers ML odds: +198When healthy, both of these teams are among the biggest threats in the NFC. The problem is that they continue to be battling injuries at key areas of the roster. For the Lions, their depleted secondary was exposed against Kansas City in Week 6, and will not have star defensive back Brian Branch for this game after he was suspended for starting a fight at the end of that contest. That only further pushes them behind the eight-ball at stopping the pass. Meanwhile, the Bucs wide receiver group is also dinged up, with Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Emeka Egbuka all questionable. However, even if one of them suits up in Week 7, that could be enough for Baker Mayfield to have similar results that Patrick Mahomes had a week ago. Speaking of Mayfield, his 12 upset wins since joining the Buccaneers are the most in the NFL (since 2023).\n\n        \n            \n                Predicting overreactions for NFL Week 7: Trey Hendrickson done with Bengals?

While a lot of the attention is being paid to the offensive side of the ball, let's not ignore the defense either. Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo of the New York Giants lit them up for 34 points in Week 6. Now, they are expected to fend off a Vikings offense headlined by Justin Jefferson after resting up on the bye the week prior? Okay, let's talk about the Eagles offense. As a team, they are being outscored 52-17 over the last five quarters, and rank 30th in the NFL in yards per game (274.5) on the season. This is hardly a get-right spot for the unit as they will face a Vikings defense that ranks fifth in the NFL in points per game (19.4), sixth in yards per game (289.8), and second on third down (30% conversion rate). Minnesota is also 4-1 as an underdog since the start of last season, which includes a 2-0 record as a home dog. Atlanta Falcons at San Francisco 49ers (-2.5)\nWhen: 8:20 p.m. ET | Where: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara)TV: NBC | Stream: (Fubo, try for free)Falcons ML odds: +110The hits keep coming to the 49ers on the defensive side of the ball. The latest devastating injury comes with Fred Warner, who is out for the season due to an ankle injury he suffered last week. Warner is a first-team All-Pro talent, so this is a monumental loss for a Niners team that can't afford to lose many bodies on that side of the ball. That ailing unit now faces a Falcons offense that has explosive playmakers like Drake London and Bijan Robinson at their disposal to help exploit their deficiencies. Atlanta is fresh off an upset win over Buffalo, and has done well in this spot. The Falcons have won four of their last five prime-time games, including a 2-0 record this season. Meanwhile, the Niners are 3-6 in their last nine games at home.  Carolina Panthers (-1.5) at New York Jets\nWhen: 1 p.m. ET | Where: MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford)TV: Fox | Stream: (Fubo, try for free)Jets ML odds: +108The Jets actually opened as the favorite in this matchup, but the odds have swung entirely in the opposite direction. It's hard to blame bettors after seeing New York's offense founder in London in Week 6, but let's not entirely rule out the possibility of the Jets notching their first win here. While it was masked due to poor play from the offense, the Jets defense and special teams units were solid against the Broncos and had them in range of an upset. That defense now faces a Panthers offense that is a wildly different team on the road than they are at home. This season, Carolina is 0-3 on the road and is averaging 15 points per game on offense while the defense is surrendering 31.7 points per game. If those trends continue, the Jets may not need Justin Fields to throw it around the yard in order to win. \nMiami Dolphins at Cleveland Browns (-3)\nWhen: 1 p.m. ET | Where: Huntington Bank Field (Cleveland)TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+Dolphins ML odds: +134The Dolphins feel like they are teetering. They are 1-5, and Tua Tagovailoa just called out the leadership on his team after last week's defeat against the Los Angeles Chargers. Their defense has also struggled mightily, allowing 29.0 points per game this season. So, why are we identifying them as a possible upset candidate? The Browns offense continues to be middling even after the switch to Dillon Gabriel at quarterback. Over the last two weeks, Gabriel's completion percentage (57%) and yards per attempt (4.8) are last in the NFL. If that continues, this will be a tight enough game where one or two throws from Tagovailoa could be enough to pull away. This is the first game Cleveland is favored this season, after going 0-4 as a favorite in 2024. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Baker Mayfield is firmly within the MVP conversation more than a third of the way through the 2025 NFL season, and that makes for one of the most remarkable turnarounds for a player in recent NFL history considering the former No. 1 overall pick was dispatched by two teams not that long ago.While the story is spectacular, I believe there has been some misremembering of how we all got here. With the benefit of hindsight and excluding context, it is easy to say the Cleveland Browns should have never given up on Mayfield after four years. And it could be fair to jeer at the Carolina Panthers for not making it a year with Mayfield.But the truth is the NFL collective, given multiple chances over the course of the early 2020s, could have had Mayfield under their employ for a day-three draft pick or a base salary of $5 million. And several times over, other teams stuck with their aging veteran, or focused on the draft, or chose to spend their money elsewhere instead of on the former top pick who is now playing at an elite level for the 5-1 Buccaneers.Why Cleveland exiled MayfieldLet's get this out of the way early: the Browns are forever on the hook for what has become the worst trade in NFL history. Cleveland believed Deshaun Watson would be an upgrade at quarterback over Mayfield -- something just about every NFL talent evaluator would have agreed upon at the time -- and sent three first-round picks and more to Houston to sign Watson to the largest fully guaranteed contract in league history -- something not many across the league would have done at the time.\nFour years after being the top pick in Cleveland, Mayfield was immediately rendered expendable in March 2022 when the Browns made that transaction. He could no longer be a member of the Browns, and everyone knew it.The Browns, meanwhile, have gotten a handful of good games out of Watson's 19 starts, a couple season-ending injuries, a lot of embarrassment and a bevy of day-three picks spent on quarterbacks who have either proven they aren't the future or have the rest of this season to do so.How'd it get to the point where Mayfield couldn't stay in Cleveland after being taken with the top pick in 2018? Mayfield brought the first -- and, to this point, only -- playoff victory to this iteration of the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs following the 2020 season. That strong play encouraged GM Andrew Berry and the organization to exercise Mayfield's fifth-year option for the 2022 season.\nBut 2021 was a miserable year for the Browns and continued Mayfield's up-and-down play across his rookie contract. Cleveland hovered around .500 most of the season as Mayfield played through injuries. Mayfield dealt with shoulder ailments through the year and, feeling the pressure of performing for a contract (according to sources), tried to grit his way through it.Odell Beckham Jr. more or less forced his way out of Cleveland in part thanks to his father sharing videos on social media of Mayfield not locating his wide-open son on the field. The Browns had to release Beckham, who went on to flourish with the Rams en route to a Super Bowl victory.Mayfield's personality, at times, clashed with people in the Browns building. When the wins aren't coming, that can rub people the wrong way. And Mayfield acknowledged as much years later, just this past week.\n\"Early on in my career it was 'cocky, immature.' Now it's 'moxie' and 'he's a dog,'\" Mayfield said last week. \"Same shit, different day. As long as you play well, they change the narrative, but you've just got to be yourself, and I've always been like that.\"Had Cleveland not gotten Watson, it is very possible the Browns go into the 2022 season with Mayfield, in a make-or-break year, with emotions frayed on all sides and relationships fractured. Berry, the GM, had done his homework on all the draftable quarterbacks and even if Cleveland selected one, that rookie wouldn't have been a true challenge to Mayfield to start the year. Would Mayfield have had a season that commanded a long-term extension, or even a franchise tag? We'll never know.Cleveland made the ill-fated move for Watson in the 2022 offseason believing it had found a marked improvement at the position. And Mayfield was clearly on the trading block with an $18.858 million contract for the season.\nFew options for Mayfield on way out of ClevelandNo one outside of Carolina seemed to want him. Go back to that offseason and revisit the moves, a real who's who of bad-to-mediocre quarterback play: Once Atlanta's pursuit of Watson became known, Matt Ryan and his big contract went to Indianapolis for a third-round pick, with Nick Foles backing him up. The Falcons decided to roll with Marcus Mariota and later drafted Desmond Ridder. The Titans cruised into what would be their final year with Ryan Tannehill and spent a third-round pick on Malik Willis. Mitchell Trubisky signed a two-year deal with Pittsburgh before the Steelers selected Kenny Pickett as the first quarterback in the draft. The Raiders gave Derek Carr a three-year extension. The Commanders dealt two third-round picks to acquire Carson Wentz. The Broncos sold the farm for Russell Wilson. The Seahawks went with Geno Smith and Drew Lock. And the Saints re-signed Jameis Winston and signed Andy Dalton.Not even one of those players remains on those teams today.At that point the Panthers had been trying to figure out what to do without Cam Newton for three seasons. Hell, Carolina ran through so many options that it even brought Newton back hoping it would work again.Matt Rhule's Way of the Panther led Carolina to Mayfield, who had to eat some of his contract in order to facilitate the trade. The Browns also had to pay down some of his deal. The Panthers sent a conditional fifth-round pick to Cleveland to get Mayfield and pay less than $5 million of his salary. It took both sides until a few weeks before training camp for them to agree to terms, meaning Mayfield missed all of spring work.\nThat's right. The top-two MVP candidate today had to take a paycut in order to be traded to the only other NFL team that wanted him three years ago.Mayfield battled with Sam Darnold for the starting job and won, but Carolina was not a good football team. Rhule was fired after Mayfield's fifth start and a 1-4 open, and Mayfield was sidelined with a high ankle sprain. By the time he came back, the Panthers had no offensive identity and eventually released him the first week of December.\"He wasn't the right offensive-wise and with the scheme,\" one coach on the Panthers staff tells CBS Sports. \"We traded for him in the summer right before training camp. He is more of a shotgun QB in my opinion, and we had him under center a lot.\"\nMayfield was dealing with off-field family issues during his abbreviated stint in Carolina.  \n                                                                    Getty Images\n                                                            A different Carolina source pointed to some personal turmoil Mayfield was dealing with at the time that eventually became public. Last year, Mayfield sued his father's company alleging a failure to repay millions of dollars stolen from him.According to the lawsuit, Mayfield had $12 million stolen from him between 2018 and 2021 by a company operated by his father and brother. That lawsuit was filed last November.\"He was dealing with that off the field… and the coaching change didn't help,\" a Panthers source said.\nMayfield's brief flash with McVayThe day after Carolina waived him, the Rams claimed Mayfield and gave him a crash course on the playbook with Matthew Stafford dealing with a spinal cord injury. When John Wolford was ineffective on Thursday Night Football against the Raiders, Sean McVay inserted Mayfield in a game that has since become legend. Mayfield won the game 17-16 over Las Vegas (though it didn't count as an official quarterback win since Wolford started) and has been used as a turning point in Mayfield's career.Indeed, Mayfield learned plenty under McVay, and the quarterback has credited McVay with helping him love the game again. But Mayfield would go 1-3 as a starter with the Rams -- who were also down Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald down the stretch -- with their only win coming in the Christmas massacre of the Broncos that served as Nathaniel Hackett's final game as a head coach.With Stafford being the unquestioned leader of the Rams, and with Mayfield having higher aspirations than backup duty, a return to Los Angeles wasn't in the cards for the 2023 season. And so again, ahead of free agency and the draft, all NFL teams were aware that Mayfield was available.\nMayfield not a slam-dunk Bucs starterThe Buccaneers came calling after Tom Brady retired officially, again. They had Kyle Trask on the roster but needed more in the quarterback room. Tampa GM Jason Licht offered Mayfield a one-year, $4 million contract with some incentives to come to the Bucs and compete with Trask for the starting job ahead of the 2023 season.That's right. The top-two MVP candidate today had to split first-team reps two years ago with a player who, at that point, had nine career pass attempts and who today is not signed to a team.To Bucs coaches, Mayfield was clearly the better option. Some thought the \"competition\" was more due diligence than anything, considering Tampa had spent a second-round pick on Trask in 2021 when it was unclear how long Brady would keep playing.\nBut Mayfield practiced poorly at times during that camp, according to sources. He threw several interceptions and had bad footwork as he settled into another new environment on a prove-it contract.We know what has happened since. Mayfield led the Bucs to the playoffs in 2023, was a play or two away from the NFC title game and wound up earning nearly $6.9 million when totaling incentives he reached. He went to the Pro Bowl that year for the first time in his career, and he signed a three-year contract worth up to $100 million with the Bucs in March 2023.Mayfield followed that up with another Pro Bowl and playoff season last year, setting career highs in completion percentage and passing touchdowns. He even registered on the NFL MVP voting with an 11th place finish.This year, with his third Bucs offensive coordinator in three years, Mayfield has put together four fourth-quarter game-winning comebacks and drives in six games. He has 12 passing touchdowns to just one interception, good for the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the league through six weeks. And his 108.5 passer rating is the best of his career, all doing it without Mike Evans, Chris Godwin, Tristan Wirfs and Bucky Irving for some collection of games.Today the Bucs are at the top of the NFC and are 2 1/2 games up in the division in what would be a record five straight NFC South titles. If Mayfield remains on this trajectory, not only could an NFL MVP be in his sights, but league sources believe he will be in line for another major payday.The Buccaneers wouldn't want to go into the 2026 season with Mayfield in the final year of his deal that currently has a $51.9 million cap hit. What would be the going rate for a quarterback who has led two franchises to four separate postseasons in an NFL where one playoff win (or even appearance) can get you $50 million plus per year? Mayfield is 30 years old and his play is only getting better with each passing season.Cleveland drafted a great player in 2018 but it didn't work out in the long term. Who knows if Mayfield would be the MVP candidate he is today in Tampa had he stayed with the Browns over those years.\n        \n            \n                Week 7 NFL QB Power Rankings: Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield the MVP favorite? Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes also rises\n                \n                    Cody Benjamin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Browns and Panthers each had Mayfield and willingly let him go. But any team that didn't have an entrenched starter -- and that is about half the league -- had every opportunity to go after him and declined.That's Tampa Bay's gain, and Mayfield's story gets even better.\n            ",

Overall, the two years leading up to this cycle (2025-26) were the most hectic we've seen this century, with a total of 61 programs changing head coaches. That means an incredible 44.9% of FBS teams changed leadership during a two-year span.

It is a wider lens than simply what happened at the last tournament to be played but more narrow than the Official World Golf Rankings, which take into account how more than 2,000 golfers perform across an entire season.The Power 181\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Scottie Scheffler\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nScheffler had an answer for everything this PGA Tour season with six wins including two major championships, but questions have surfaced around his play in team competitions. He became the first world No. 1 to go 0-4-0 across the first four sessions of the Ryder Cup -- first golfer, period, to do it in the modern era -- and was without his best stuff at Bethpage Black for much of the week. Scheffler remains the clear-cut best player in the world, but if the U.S. Ryder Cup team's fortunes are to change down the road, Scheffler summoning his A-game in the event would be a nice start.

He moved to seventh on the all-time European Ryder Cup points list with his 3-1-1 record following his 4-1-0 showing in Rome. McIlroy now turns his attention to the impending DP World Tour playoffs where he will aim to defend his title and win another Race to Dubai.

Instead, Fleetwood settled for a 4-1-0 mark and a career 11-4-2 record across his four appearances. He now has the highest point percentage among Europeans to play in at least 10 Ryder Cup matches with a 70.6% rate.

The burly Spaniard marched his way around Bethpage Black with intent, improving to 6-0-0 in foursomes in his Ryder Cup career. Rahm's performance in New York was another reminder of when he is on he is among, if not, the best in the game.

The world No. 4 put together a strong 3-1-0 showing the included a relatively stress-free victory over Rahm in Sunday singles. Schauffele did not make a ton of putts on the week but allowed his tee-to-green acumen to lead the way in terms of his performance. The putter was a problem (relative to 2024) in 2025 before he found it in a big way in Japan where he notched a win at the Baycurrent Classic.

The Englishman was stellar with a 2-1-1 record to collect his first Ryder Cup points in the U.S. He squandered a massive lead over Bryson DeChambeau in Sunday singles, but the week as a whole can only be viewed as a success.

He did not receive a ton of help in his Friday foursomes match but exacted revenge the following morning with Young by his side. The two-time U.S. Open champion had a long putt to win his singles match on the 18th hole after falling as many as five behind Fitzpatrick before settling for a tie and a 1-3-1 record on the week.

Young looked more than comfortable in his Ryder Cup debut going 3-1-0 and ranking second in just about every strokes-gained category behind only Fleetwood. The question now becomes if he is able to use this experience as a launch pad similar to Jordan Spieth at the Presidents Cup and Scheffler at the Ryder Cup.

While his iron play was not as sharp as it had been for much of the year, the Norwegian notched major moments thanks to his putter. His ability to rise up to the moment seems to only be getting better the more times he gets into the situation.

He went 1-1-1 with Hovland by his side for foursomes action and wasn't the least bit afraid of giving it back to the American fans. His chipping and pitching remain some of the most underrated in the professional game, pushing him to a win at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship the week after the Ryder Cup. Previous: 1412\n    \n                        \n                        \n    \n                                            \n                    \n    \n            \n    \n                    \n                Russell Henley\n                    \n            \n            \n        \nHenley's Ryder Cup will receive some unfair criticism due to leaving putts short on Nos. 17-18 against Shane Lowry, which would have staved off a European win. Despite this, the world No. 3 was relatively solid throughout the week after shedding some early nerves. He went 0-2-1 with both losses coming in foursomes alongside Scheffler while ranking sixth in field in total strokes gained.

The U.S. Open champion was ultra comfortable in his Ryder Cup debut as he went 2-1-0 which included a straightforward defeat of Sepp Straka on Sunday. He probably should have been out on the course in at least one of the foursomes matches but he made the most of his opportunities elsewhere. It's unknown how long this run of his will last, but it is known that he has a hankering for the arena.

The 45-year-old turned back to the clock and turned into an absolute menace alongside Fleetwood on Friday and Saturday afternoon to defeat DeChambeau twice alongside Ben Griffin and Scheffler. He leaned heavily on the putter, but he continues to show his best can still stack up with the best in the world.

Thomas made an emphatic putt on the last to hand Fleetwood his lone loss of the week and went 2-2-0 in the process. He was benched Saturday morning in a little bit of a head-scratching move. His usual staples -- iron play and short game -- showed up in a big way for him.

The Swede showed up out of the gates with Fitzpatrick Friday morning but then struggled across his next two playing sessions. His iron play was not at its sharpest, but overall it proved to be a solid showing in his first Ryder Cup in a hostile environment.

Griffin finished runner up to Scheffler at the Procore Championship entering the Ryder Cup, continuing his string of consistent play that stretches back to the spring. He might have some work to do to elevate or at least maintain his level of play when the situation is heightened.

Cantlay was the lone American to drop a full point on Sunday and had his chances to leave his prints on this event. A couple of short putts proved costly for him, namely on No. 14 Friday afternoon where he halved a match with McIlroy and Shane Lowry alongside Sam Burns. All in all, he is an asset for the red, white and blue, but it was far from his best stuff at Bethpage.  Previous: 11\n            \n    \n\n        \n                                            ",

    "body": "\n        One thing that all NBA fans love to do at the beginning of each season is to predict the award winners for the upcoming campaign. We love doing that as well, but let's do it from a fantasy perspective! We'll look at all the major awards from a fantasy perspective, with some overlap from the actual awards. With that in mind, let's get started.Fantasy MVPNikola Jokic, NuggetsIn a sport where everyone wants to debate who the GOAT is, there's no question that Jokic is the best player in the NBA right now. He has been for a few years now, flirting with triple-double averages in each of the last three years. That culminated in a career year last season, with Joker averaging 29.6 points, 12.7 rebounds, 10.2 assists, 1.8 steals, 0.6 blocks, and two 3s per game. Those counting stats already have Jokic as the best player in fantasy, but he's doing that while shooting 58 percent from the field, 41 percent from 3-point range, and 80 percent from the free-throw line. He's truly the only player in the NBA who's a net positive in all nine categories in fantasy, and we didn't even mention that he's played at least 69 games in all 10 seasons. It's almost a cheat code to land a player like Jokic, and it would be silly to pick anyone else as the fantasy MVP. In Consideration: Victor Wembanyama (SAS)Wemby and Jokic are the top two picks in every fantasy draft, and we'll discuss that in the next section!Fantasy Defensive Player of the YearVictor Wembanyama, SpursIt was sad to see Wemby miss the final months of 2024-25 due to a blood clot, but he still had a sensational season. The French big man averaged 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 1.1 steals, 3.8 blocks, and 3.1 3s per game. Since we're looking at the most valuable defensive member, the 11 rebounds, 1.1 steals, and 3.8 blocks stand out. Those averages are amazing, and he had 176 total blocks across 46 games. The next highest total was Brook Lopez with 148 blocks, and he played 80 games. That's why Wemby nearly doubled up the player in second in terms of averages, and he's adding double-digit rebounds and over a steal a night to that league-winning block average. All of that has Wemby as a heavy favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year on most sportsbooks, and the only reason it's not higher is because of injury risk. \nIn Consideration: Dyson Daniels (ATL)Daniels led the league with three steals per game last season and had 229 in total. The second-closest averaged fewer than two steals per game, and no other player had more than 131 steals. If you want to land Wemby and Daniels in your draft, you might lock up the defensive statistics every week. Fantasy Rookie of the YearCooper Flagg, MavericksI wanted to avoid the obvious pick with Flagg, but there's sadly not much competition. If you look at the Rookie of the Year odds, Flagg is a heavy favorite on most sites. That's not a massive favorite, but Dylan Harper, Ace Bailey, VJ Edgecombe, and Tre Johnson are all sitting near 10-to-1. All of those guys have serious question marks in terms of their roles, but Flagg should be one of the primary contributors for the Mavs. He was the consensus top pick in this year's draft, taking down College Player of the Year in his one season at Duke. It's the versatile skillset that makes him such a problem for opponents, with Flagg projected to average 16.9 points, 6.2 rebounds, four assists, 1.1 steals, 0.8 blocks, and 1.6 3s on elite shooting percentages. He could very well finish top 5 in all of those statistics among rookies, and it's why he's being selected around 40th in most drafts right now. Most of his fellow rookies are falling to the final rounds, with many going undrafted.In Consideration: Ace Bailey (UTA)Bailey has the best opportunity of any rookie because he should play 30 minutes and take 15 shots a night for a rebuilding Jazz team. \nMost Improved Fantasy PlayerReed Sheppard, RocketsMy first inclination was to have Amen Thompson in this spot, but let's go with his teammate. Sheppard was the No. 3 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft and finally looks poised for a big opportunity. Sheppard was mainly a reserve last season, but he may be this team's starting point guard with Fred VanVleet getting injured. He's earned that role when looking at his G League statistics, averaging 30.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 2.7 steals, and five 3s per game. While that was only three games, Sheppard showed a similar profile when he played big minutes for the Rockets. In the four games that he played at least 20 minutes, Sheppard averaged 18.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, 3.5 assists, two steals, and four 3s per game. There's an elite fantasy profile if he gets the full allotment of minutes, and it'll be nearly impossible to keep him below 20-25 minutes with VanVleet going down. In Consideration: Andrew Nembhard (IND)Nembhard should take over as the starting point guard in Indy with Tyrese Haliburton injured. There aren't many better opportunities than the ringleader for one of the fastest-paced and most efficient offenses in the NBA. Bounceback Fantasy Player of the YearKevin Porter Jr., BucksJalen Johnson is an obvious pick for this slot, but Porter is a sneaky selection near the end of drafts. Many people forget how highly touted Porter was before some off-court issues, averaging 17.1 points, 4.5 rebounds, 6.1 assists, 1.1 steals, and 2.3 3s in his three seasons with the Rockets. We saw glimpses of that guy when Damian Lillard got injured last season, with KPJ averaging 15 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.1 3s in the 29 games he played at least 22 minutes. We're using that 22-minute threshold because most of that came at the end of the year, and Porter should be looking at a minimum of 25 minutes as Milwaukee's starting point guard this season. It's simply one of the weakest backcourts in the NBA, and Porter's fantasy value should skyrocket because of that. \nIn Consideration: Zion Williamson (NOP)Zion lost more weight than Jonah Hill this summer and could be poised for a career year with New Orleans, parting ways with CJ McCollum and Brandon Ingram while missing Dejounte Murray to begin the season following an Achilles tear.Most Valuable Undrafted PlayerIsaiah Jackson, PacersThis is a risky pick with Jackson coming off an Achilles tear, but all signs point to the big man being fully healthy. That's a huge factor, but the most important variable is the loss of Myles Turner. That leaves 30 minutes and the starting center gig up for grabs, with I-Jax looking like the best bet to fill that void. He's been the starting center in the preseason and has always been one of the best per-minute producers in the NBA. He's been held to just 15.4 minutes a night behind Turner through his first four years but still averaged 7.3 points, 4.6 rebounds, 0.8 assists, 0.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 60 percent shooting. That means his per-36 averages equate to 17.3 points, 10.3 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 1.4 steals, and 3.2 blocks per game. There's no chance that Jackson comes anywhere near 36 minutes, but 25-30 could be in play if he fully breaks out. It costs almost nothing to take I-Jax at the end of your draft, and you could stumble into a Top 75 player if he starts and plays 25 minutes a night with that fantastic fantasy profile. In Consideration: Khris Middleton (WAS)This is a gross recommendation, but Middleton could be the focal point of Washington's offense at times. He's apparently fully healthy, averaging 17.5 points, 4.9 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.1 steals, and 1.9 3s over the last decade. Even if he gives you that for two months, Middleton could be a sneaky find off the waiver wire or at the end of your draft. Many people think the youngsters are going to take over in Washington, but don't be surprised to see C.J. McCollum and Middleton leaned on heavier than most might expect.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The American League Championship Series will resume on Wednesday night with Game 3 between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners. The Mariners took the first two games of this best-of-seven set, leaving them two victories away from their first World Series appearance. The Blue Jays, conversely, must now win at least two games on the road to force the series back home to Toronto for potential Games 6 and 7.To run the risk of stating the obvious: the Blue Jays are in a bad way. Historically, MLB teams that have fallen behind 2-0 in a best-of-seven series have then lost that series more than 80% of the time. The Blue Jays can't worry too much about precedent, though, not if they want to beat the odds. They have to focus on what's in front of them and, bit by bit, get back into this series beginning with Game 3.\"Always going to have optimism about this team,\" Toronto manager John Schneider said after Game 2. \"They just made more swings than us the last two games is kind of what it comes down to.\"Whatever you make of the Blue Jays' chances, here are three keys for them to salvage the series.\n1. Get Guerrero, offense goingThe Blue Jays ranked fourth in the majors in runs scored and park-adjusted offense during the regular season. You wouldn't know it based on the first two games. Toronto as a whole has hit .131/.232/.197 with just two extra-base hits (a double and a home run) and four total runs scored. \"Do what we've done all year. I think just looking at the difference in these first two, you know, slug hasn't been there for us, has been there for them, and you never know when it's going to turn. They've got a good pitching staff. They're featuring some good stuff,\" Schneider said of his offense. \"I thought today was way better than yesterday, obviously, and we hit some balls hard. I want these guys to continue to feel like they're on the attack; you know what I mean? It's what we've done this entire season.\"Hopefully the luck turns, and hopefully the slug shows up when we get there.\"Notable Blue Jays offensive performersPlayerPositionALCS OPSRegular season OPSVladimir Guerrero Jr.1B.125.848Daulton VarshoCF.000.833Andrés GiménezSS.143.598Addison Barger3B.250.756Davis SchneiderLF.200.797Those struggles, naturally, have enveloped most of the lineup. The two exceptions have been outfielders Nathan Lukes and George Springer, who have combined for five of their eight hits (including the aforementioned extra-base hits, both of which belong to Springer). Anthony Santander is the only other Blue Jays player with an OPS above .400. Otherwise? The Blue Jays have five players, including superstar first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who are hitless through four or more at-bats.\nGuerrero is, obviously, the highest profile player of the bunch. He's the one with the $500 million contract, and his name and image are in most of the promotional material. So far, the Mariners have peppered him with sinkers away, even from right-handed pitchers. In fact, the next time in this series that Guerrero puts a ball in play that is thrown to the inner half of the plate, it will also be the first time. Clearly, that approach is working. It's up to Guerrero to adjust ahead of Game 3.2. Figure out PolancoYou shouldn't envy the task facing Toronto's pitching staff. For all the attention the Blue Jays have undoubtedly paid to switch-hitting catcher Cal Raleigh and outfielder Julio Rodríguez in pregame meetings, it's been second baseman Jorge Polanco who has given them the most trouble in Games 1 and 2.Polanco opened the series with consecutive two-hit games. What's more, he's plated the go-ahead run in both contests, including launching a three-run shot in the fifth on Monday.\n\"That was just a great at-bat, getting in there and just doing what Polo does. He waits to get a good pitch and he puts a really good swing on it, and he's a tough out right now,\" Mariners manager Dan Wilson said after Game 2. \"It's been huge for us, and he's come up in situations where we've had guys on, and he's been able to do the job and drive them in. That's what this game is all about. It's been phenomenal.\"Three of Polanco's four hits so far have been against fastballs that clocked in at 96 mph or above. He also recorded a single on a first-pitch curveball in the late stages of Game 2.3. Get luckyLuck is often treated as a four-letter word in analysis, but let's face it: the Blue Jays are going to need to catch their share of breaks to pull even or overtake the Mariners the rest of the way. What that looks like depends on your imagination. It could mean a few seeing-eye singles, or it could mean catching some at 'em balls off the Mariners bats. One obvious alternate possibility? Having Seattle ace Bryan Woo, seemingly in line to start Game 5, experience some rust in his return to the mound. Woo, 25, was one of the Mariners' top performers during the regular season. He hasn't pitched since Sept. 19 on account of a pectoral injury. It's not hard to envision a scenario where he isn't as sharp as usual in what will double as his postseason debut.But Woo's Game 5 start isn't a given because there are no guarantees the series will last that long. For now, the Blue Jays can only focus on what's in front of them. Everything else is contingent on that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Lists like this -- 25 under 25 in this case -- lists are not uncommon, especially heading into the 2025-26 NBA season. But instead of adding to the significant amount of discourse already in that area, we're going to tweak that concept just a bit and rank the 25 best prospects in the NBA today.  Ranking prospects can be vastly different than players because one is about forecasting for the future, while the other is an assessment of where they are today. In other words, this list is more about who are the best long-term assets, or who could be the best players when they reach their prime, and not who are the best today.  \n        \n            \n                NBA Top 100 players, ranked: How Nikola Jokić, SGA, Luka Dončić and more stack up as new season begins\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPut it another way, if salary camp implications weren't a consideration, which active NBA players under the age of 25 would you most like to have if you were building a roster. Let's get to it.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n     1. Victor Wembanyama, Spurs (21 years old) This list is debatable at virtually every spot, except this one. The only way that Wemby isn't the best long-term prospect in the NBA is if durability becomes a huge problem. Despite last year's blood clot issue, we don't have any evidence that is the case. To the contrary, prior to that, his availability had exceeded expectations. His unprecedented overlap of measurables and mobility allows him to change the game defensively unlike any other player in the league. Offensively, he's been given the freedom to shoot threes and stretch his game over the last two years and, while some of his efficiency metrics could trend up, he showed more alpha potential than even most projected on draft night two years ago. The bottom line is that if he's healthy, he's every bit the generational talent that was promised.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. Anthony Edwards, Timberwolves (24)Edwards may be one of the older players on this list, but he's also one of the best players in the NBA right now. He put up 28 points per game last year while leading the association in made 3s. For those of us that have been tracking him since high school, it's the escalation of his shooting that has proven to be the biggest surprise. The force with which he can create is not unsurprisingly, but couple that with the shooting and creation for others, and you have a player who looks poised to be one of the league's best guards for the foreseeable future. Of course, nothing cements a player's reputation like their production under the bright lights, and the 24-year-old has already developed a reputation for having that clutch gene come playoff time.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Paolo Banchero, Magic (22)The 22-year-old Banchero is coming off a shortened 2024-25 campaign in which he averaged nearly 26 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists. So, while there are probably a handful of reasonable candidates to round out the top three, ultimately Banchero got the nod for two distinct reasons. First and foremost is the extreme rate of improvement. I've been watching him live since the spring of his freshman year of high school and seen him make notable jumps with each passing year. Second, despite being just 22-years-old, he's already a proven offensive focal point. This year, he's going to have the chance to prove he can do it on a contender as the addition of Desmond Bane should be critical to taking the Magic to the next level.  Big news, NBA fans.

If I were starting a team today, I would choose to build around him rather than anyone else besides the aforementioned three. He can play multiple positions, change the game defensively, and has an ideal overlap of intense competitor and instinctive processor. If he proves he can be the type of offensive alpha who can lead a contending team, then this spot might even prove to be too low, but it's relatively aggressive given some of the already proven prospects that are still behind him. He's also 18 years old. In other words, he's got a runway of the next 15-plus years.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. Cade Cunningham, Pistons (24)What we saw last season was essentially what most of us who have seen Cunningham since high school have been expecting for years. Cunningham became one of the best players in the NBA. He not only averaged 26 points, nine assists, and six rebounds per game, but he put up a career high 35.6% from 3 on a career high 5.3 attempts per game, all the while leading the NBA's most-improved team. The shooting fell off a little bit in the playoffs, but everything else was just as good. Simultaneously, he was very solid on the defensive end of the floor. So, if the shooting keeps getting more reliable, especially in key moments, and most importantly he stays healthy, Cunningham should be poised to play the best basketball of his career for the next five or so years.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Jalen Williams, Thunder (24)SGA may have been the MVP, but Williams was just as valuable to OKC's championship run. His versatility, two-way impact, and consistent improvement are all widely acknowledged, and rightfully so. Beyond that though was his toughness to play through injury and unselfishness to buy into his role and not allow any fraction or dissent to be formed around role allocation. The only knock is that he is more Robin than Batman on the offensive end, but that may be contextual. Not only did he put up 22 points per game on 48/37/79 shooting, but he averaged five assists per game and was one of the best iso scores in the NBA according to the advanced analytics.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Chet Holmgren, Thunder (23)Other than Wemby, Holmgren is the young center that I would most want to build my roster around for the foreseeable future. In a league that values two-way versatility and offensive spacing, Holmgren is a 7-footer who can stretch the floor and already an elite rim protector. The durability of his frame has been a talking point for years now, and after missing the 2022-23 season and 50 regular-season games last year, that's going to continue to be a key variable in his future. However, he's functionally stronger than almost anyone expected, provides optionality to their lineups because of his ability to play the four or five, and is still sacrificing some of his individual offense to build this young championship core.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. Amen Thompson, Rockets (22)There is a case to be made that Thompson is both the best athlete and non-Wemby defender in the NBA. He's also one of the more versatile, and maybe even positionless, players in the NBA. In just two seasons, we've seen him guard everyone from opposing big men to guards. Now, to start Year 3, with Fred VanVleet going down with injury and Ime Udoka experimenting with some jumbo line-ups in the preseason, we may get a chance to see if Thompson has some of that point guard potential that was talked about a couple of years ago when he was going through the pre-draft process.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Evan Mobley, Cavaliers (24)The reining Defensive Player of the Year was also named second team All-NBA last year, while pushing his numbers to nearly 19 points and nine rebounds per game on a Cavs team that won 64 games. Essentially, it was the realization of the vast potential that has been easily recognizable since his days in high school. The 24-year-old is poised to be the hub of a top-notch defense for years to come, but it will be the progression of his offensive game that ultimately dictates his ceiling. Based on the early reviews this preseason, when Mobley has been handling the ball and extending his range more, his two-way versatility appears to be still ascending.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    10. Alperen Sengun, Rockets (23)Sengun is the most polarizing player among the top 10, even among NBA decision-makers. His supporters cite his interior skill, playmaking from the 5 spot, and surprising durability. His doubters the limited athleticism, lack of defensive versatility, and rim protection. He is starting this season in the best shape of his career so far, with an opportunity to be even more of a playmaker in VanFleet's absence, and alongside a generational scorer like Kevin Durant. It's also worth noting that Sengun doesn't rely on athleticism to be productive, so the 23-year-old's style should age well.  \n        \n            \n                Next year's NBA Top 100 players: Lonzo Ball, Quentin Grimes, Deandre Ayton among 10 players on the verge\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    11.  Tyrese Maxey, 76ers (24)Maxey is the oldest player on this list and will turn 25 in less than a month. Put another way, while some players project to be trending up for the foreseeable future, he's now probably in his prime. The 2023-24 season was one in which he showed real potential stardom. Last year wasn't just riddled by injuries, but also declining efficiencies and a 3-point percentage that was almost 10% lower than two years prior. With Maxey's ability to make on-ball reads having dramatically improved over the years, he can be virtually unguardable when the 3s are falling. Increased physicality and durability are other points of emphasis, as he steps into more of a true leadership role for the Sixers.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    12.  Scottie Barnes, Raptors (24)Is he or is he not a true No. 1 option on offense? That is one of, if not the, biggest question that faces the Raptors moving forward. Getting a definitive answer to that question is also one of the major subplots of this season. Barnes was a 22-year-old All-Star a couple of years ago, but saw his numbers drop across the board last year as his volume increased. Even if he proves to be better suited as a secondary option though, he still has the potential to impact the game in a multitude of ways, on both ends of the floor. The key variable hasn't changed since he was in high school though ... so much of it comes down to the shooting.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    13.  Franz Wagner, Magic (24)We're now at the point on the list where we've exhausted all the probable lead creators. In Orlando, Wagner has been slotted as the secondary option behind Banchero, and yet he still put up 24 points, six boards, and five dimes last season. The combination of wing size at 6-foot-10 and playmaking off the dribble, makes him a true mismatch problem, while his defensive value is often understated as well. For a non-primary though, the floor spacing is going to have to keep coming. He's been under 30% from behind the arc for two consecutive years, despite being above 85% from the free-throw line, and needs to be able to create more space off the ball.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    14.  Dylan Harper, Spurs (19)What we said on draft night four months ago remains true today. Harper is a big lead guard with size, strength, length, and terrific natural instincts. His long-term success is going to come down to three key variables: shooting, durability and defense. He's battled nagging injuries for years, historically has had a bit of a flatter shot, and never had to truly commit to maximizing his defense. But he has all the tools and talent and now looks like he could be the best sub-20 point guard prospect in the league.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    15.  Jalen Johnson, Hawks (23)Johnson finally started to turn potential into production as a 21-year-old back in the 2023-24. Last year, came the full breakout before he was derailed by a shoulder injury. A high-level athlete on the wing with positional size and playmaking for others, he now looks like a real building block for Atlanta. The only caveat is that this optimism is based on two seasons in which he has played only a combined 92 games. So, like others on this list, shooting and durability are key pieces. Alongside an ultra-skilled shot-maker like Trae Young though, he's found an ideal fit to maximize what he does best.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    16.  Dyson Daniels, Hawks (22)Staying in Atlanta, we have one of the best up-and-coming perimeter defenders in the league. Daniels' defensive playmaking metrics were off the charts last year with 3.7 stocks per game and nearly six rebounds leading to the Most Improved Player award. Not only is he a playmaker on that end, but he protects Young, and simultaneously made notable strides with his offense. If he can sustain, or continue, the gains he made as a floor spacer and keep providing some secondary creation, his value should only continue to ascend this year for the Hawks.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    17.  Christian Braun, Nuggets (24)Just three years removed from being the 21st pick, Braun has already proven to be one of the best picks of his draft class. He moved into the starting lineup last season and more than doubled his production, averaging 15 points, five boards, and nearly three assists on 58/40/83 shooting. What's a little misleading is that he attempted only three threes in his roughly 34 minutes per game, so his gravity will increase with his volume, but he's an extremely efficient transition finisher to complement Nikola Jokic's open court passing, and also a plus defender. In short, he may not be a star, but he looks like a long-term NBA starter.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    18.  Deni Avdija, Trail Blazers (24)After four seasons in Washington, Avdija's new zip code brought a breakout year with the Blazers. He averaged 17 points, seven boards, and four assists while sustaining the notable jump in 3-point shooting that he posted the year before with the Wizards. The best part was that he continued to raise the level of his game as the season went on. At 6-foot-9, he combines strength and physicality with playmaking off the dribble to create a definite mismatch problem, not to mention a solid positional defender. Now he looks like a core building block moving forward for Portland. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    19.  Dereck Lively, Mavericks (21)Lively exceeded expectations right out of the gate as a rookie in Dallas, and maintained those numbers, albeit in an injury-plagued sophomore year. Still just 21 years old, the hope is that he will establish himself as the Mavs' clear-cut top center this season. He has immense defensive potential with his size, length, shot-blocking, and relative mobility. Offensively, he's a lob threat and extremely efficient finisher, although life without Luka Dončić may be a bit different. That niche alone gives him the potential to be a starting center in this league for the next decade, so long as he can stay healthy.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    20.  Brandon Miller, Hornets (22)Miller was recently tabbed by league GM's as one of the favorites to have a breakout season. While he played just 27 games last season, we saw some clear evidence of where his game was trending. He was taking a high-volume approach from behind the arc and basing the rest of his attack around the threat of his jumper. There was growth as a passer for others, but continued struggles as a finisher, and defender. This year, it feels like Charlotte is at a crossroads and needs to decide if they'll continue to build around Miller and LaMelo Ball. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    21.  Stephon Castle, Spurs (20)Last year's Rookie of the Year is a big guard with size, strength, athleticism, on-off ball versatility and two-ways tools. He was already one of the Spurs' best perimeter defenders last year, not to mention a consistent scoring threat at 15 points per game. The question this year is whether or not he can take the next step in a perimeter rotation that is both young and collectively strained from a spacing perspective. In other words, how are all these driving playmakers going to coexist if they can't space the floor for each other.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    22.  LaMelo Ball, Hornets (24)This is bound to be the most debated spot on the list. To be clear, this isn't about sheer talent. Ball's natural ability with the basketball, creativity, and vision, coupled by his tremendous positional size, form the profile of a truly elite prospect. Through five NBA seasons though, there are two glaring problems and a looming question. First, he can't stay healthy. He's played more than 51 games just once and hasn't eclipsed 47 games in any of the last three years. Second, he's one of the most lackadaisical defenders in the league. Put it together, and despite his gifts, Charlotte has to be wondering if he can ever drive winning at a consistent level.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    23.  Ace Bailey, Jazz (19)The case for Bailey is simple -- he's a high-level athlete with wing size and tough shot-making ability. The case against him has to do with his overall feel and efficiency. The summer league provided evidence for both perspectives. What has been encouraging though are the early returns in the preseason as Bailey has already made real strides with his understanding of how to get to spots, not waste dribbles, and move without the ball. You never want to overvalue the preseason, but the signs of growth are real and his upside has always been undeniable.  \n        \n            \n                28 dribbles on 29 shots: How the Jazz are setting Ace Bailey up for immediate success\n                \n                    Brad Botkin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    24.  VJ Edgecombe, 76ers (20)Anyone who followed last year's draft knows Edgecombe is an elite athlete, has a ton of defensive upside, and a consistently developing offensive game. What most people don't yet have a full appreciation for is his competitiveness and drive to improve. It's that, and not just the physical tools, which could fuel his development in the coming years. There's clearly plenty of work to be done, but Edgecombe is poised to be an overachiever.  \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    25.  Josh Giddey, Bulls (23)There's a case to be made that Giddey is one of the more undervalued young players in the league. He's been a starter in all four years in the association. Last year, his first in Chicago, he averaged 15 points, eight rebounds, and seven assists on 47/38/78 shooting. After the All-Star break, he put up 21 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists per game. Those all-star caliber numbers earned him a new 100-million-dollar contract, but still arguably not enough respect across the league. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Rory McIlroy would like to see the 2025 Ryder Cup remembered more for what happened on the course as opposed to what happened off of it. While Europe made history by winning an away Ryder Cup for only the seventh time in the event's history, much of the focus has instead been on the verbal abuse McIlroy and other Europeans received from some of fans.  \"I've been following the narrative coming out of the Ryder Cup, just like everyone else,\" he said this week. \"Unfortunately, I think it takes away from what we should be focused on, which is what an incredible performance it was by the European Team.\"McIlroy said that he didn't realize in the moment just how good Europe's performance was, especially during the first two days of the Ryder Cup when they built a commanding seven-point lead entering the final day of competition. He said that watching the highlights over the past two weeks has given him a newfound appreciation for what he and his teammates were able to accomplish. \n\"The Americans would hit it close, we would hit it closer,\" he said. \"The Americans would hole a putt, we'd hole a putt on top on them. And it just happened every single time.\"\n        \n            \n                The Power 18 golf rankings: Xander Schauffele returns to top five, Cameron Young among most notable movers\n                \n                    Patrick McDonald                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nOn the precipice of a blowout, Europe had to withstand a furious comeback attempt by the United States on the final day of competition. As good as Europe had been during the first two days, that's how good the United States was on Sunday during singles matches. In fact, it appeared that the U.S. was on the verge of an historic comeback before Shane Lowry made two incredible shots on 18 that included a birdie putt that gave the Europe the win. \nEurope's dominance during the first two days and the U.S. comeback attempt on Sunday are just two of the main storylines from a Ryder Cup that won't soon be forgotten. There was also the dynamic between the two captains Luke Donald and Keegan Bradley, the controversial \"envelope rule\" and the largely forgotten singles match between McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler that was the first in Ryder Cup history between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 ranked players. There was also the unruly behavior by some of the fans that led to PGA of America president Dan Rea Jr. issuing a public apology shortly after the Ryder Cup's conclusion. McIlroy and others have also chimed in on the less than ideal experience. Simply put, you can't talk about the 2025 Ryder Cup without talking about the hostile environment that -- for better and unfortunately for worse -- added to the drama that took place during those three days at Bethpage Black in New York. McIlroy certainly understands that, but he'd obviously prefer that storyline to take a backseat to some of the other things that happened during what was a memorable three days of golf. \n\"I think the unfortunate thing is, it seems like people aren't remembering that and they're remembering the week for the wrong reasons,\" he said. \"I'd like to shift the narrative a little bit and just focus on how good the European Team was and how proud I was to be part of that team to win an away Ryder Cup.\" \n            ",

look easy in cruising to 6-0. Yes, Texas and Washington pushed the Buckeyes a bit, but those games were never in any serious doubt. And a very good Illinois team couldn't do anything against OSU until garbage time. The Buckeyes have a top five defense and a top 20 offense, and it really does feel like that offensive unit can hit another gear or two. Given the path for Ohio State to the playoff (no remaining Top 25 opponents on the schedule) and its talent, I think Ohio State is the obvious pick at the midway point to win the national title. -- Chris Hummer (also Shehan Jeyarajah, Tom Fornelli, Brandon Marcello, Brad Crawford, Richard Johnson) Miami: Miami could get to the College Football Playoff blindfolded at this point, as the Hurricanes are likely to be favored by at least a touchdown in their final seven games. Once the 'Canes get there, they have all the ingredients of a team that can win it all. In Year 4 under coach Mario Cristobal, Miami finally has the heft and talent on both lines of scrimmage to withstand the rigors of a 16-game grind. Miami's capability of offensive explosiveness is also standing out. Georgia transfer quarterback Carson Beck is looking like the 2023 version of himself, thanks in large part to the emergence for star receivers Malachi Toney and CJ Daniels. Few, if any, teams have been tested as thoroughly as Miami, and the Hurricanes have passed each assignment with flying colors. There is no reason to doubt this team's bona fides as a championship contender. -- David Cobb (also John Talty) Alabama: The season opening loss to Florida State was the wake-up call that this Alabama team needed to remember the thin margin for error when it comes to playing at the top of the sport. And this prediction is not to say that Alabama will win the rest of its games, either, as recent wins against Georgia, Vanderbilt and Missouri put that thin margin on full display before the Crimson Tide came up with the game-winning plays late. But when you are operating on the margins you need a difference-maker, and to me that's Ty Simpson. He's playing like one of the best quarterbacks in the country right now and according to the players in that locker room he's one of the team's leaders and most important voices. After years of sticking with the Tide, and not transferring, I think his moment here in 2025 includes leading Alabama back to where fans believe they belong: at the top of college football's mountain. -- Chip Patterson\n        Midseason Coach of the Year     Joey McGuire, Texas Tech: It's one thing to have a talented roster, it's another to win the games, and Joey McGuire is doing nothing but win early this year. The Red Raiders are 6-0 and have the highest average scoring margin (30.4 points) of any team in college football. Yes, McGuire had the offseason resources to go out and get players. But it looks like he's made all the right calls. The roster upgrades are almost all hits, and both of Texas Tech's new coordinators have excelled. The Red Raiders are in the conversation to be the best team in the country. That's remarkable given where that program's been over the last decade -- Hummer (also Jeyarajah)Curt Cignetti, Indiana: Cignetti has guided Indiana to a 6-0 start and its highest-ever ranking in the AP poll while proving that last season's 11 wins and CFP appearance were anything but a fluke. The Hoosiers' Week 7 triumph at Oregon is in the running for best college football victory of the season, and it brings the possibility of 12-0 campaign closer to reality. This isn't just the best coaching job of the season; what Cignetti is doing at Indiana may be the best coaching job of the 21st century. -- Cobb (also Johnson, Marcello) Tony Elliot, Virginia: It's admittedly close with Indiana's Curt Cignetti, but Elliott has done more with less than nearly any coach in college football this season. The Cavaliers are one red-zone conversion away from being unbeaten and ranked inside the top 10 at midseason — something no one saw coming two months ago with a 31-player transfer class ranked outside the top 25 nationally. The fact that this team still controls its ACC title and playoff hopes in mid-October is an impressive feat on its own. The home win over then-unbeaten Florida State was special. -- Crawford (also Talty)\nMario Cristobal, Miami: One of the pieces of coaching that can be the most valuable is the ability to successfully imprint an identity on your locker room. Miami fans might have been dreaming of the old days when Cristobal stepped to the podium at his introductory press conference, but in reality what he wanted from this program was the foundational element of physicality pushed into the future for a new era. You can't spend all your time trying to recreate Miami's success from a bygone era, and Cristobal has successfully gotten the entire program to buy in on the blend of old school physicality in the trenches while embracing the on-field and off-field aspects of modern football. Miami's got one of the best offensive line-defensive line combinations in the entire country, and that's a byproduct of four great years of recruiting and developing the part of the field that Cristobal values the most. Getting the entire program to buy in on the plan and seeing it play out in an undefeated 5-0 start and No. 2 national ranking? That's just great coaching. -- Patterson (also Fornelli)      Heisman Trophy frontrunner     Ty Simpson, Alabama: -- Not only has Simpson been statistically great, he's also been on point in key situations during Alabama's five-game winning streak. He was dialed in during a game-defining first half in a victory at Georgia, steady and accurate in a win over Vanderbilt and clutch again late in a win at Missouri. All three of those wins came against top-20 opponents, and two of them were on the road. Simpson's pinpoint accuracy is his best trait, and when you combine that with some mobility and confidence, you get elite quarterback play. That's what Simpson has been providing for the Crimson Tide, especially in big moments against quality opponents. -- Cobb (also Johnson, Fornelli)Carson Beck, Miami: Filling the shoes of a Heisman finalist is no easy task, especially given how 2024 ended for Carson Beck, but he's been terrific for the Hurricanes. In three wins over top-25 opponents, Beck has thrown nine touchdown passes with a sparkling completion rate. Miami offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson identified his guy early in the portal, and the Hurricanes made it happen. Expect to see Beck in New York a few months from now — likely with Miami preparing for its first playoff appearance as a No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the final regular-season rankings.-- Crawford (also Marcello, Talty) \nTrinidad Chambliss, Ole Miss: The Heisman Trophy is a story award at heart, and there is no better story in college football than Chambliss. The senior did not start at Division II Ferris State until 2024, but has taken the sport by storm since transferring to Oxford. He has averaged more than 390 yards per game as a starter, which would lead the nation. If the Rebels can finish the job and earn a trip to the SEC title game and College Football Playoff, few will have better or more compelling cases when the award is finally handed out. A road trip to No. 9 Georgia this weekend marks a pivotal opportunity. -- (Jeyarajah)\n            ",

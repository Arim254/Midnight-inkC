The Cowboys will visit the Raiders on Monday Night Football. The Cowboys are averaging 29.2 points per game this season, including scoring at least 27 in four of their last six games. Meanwhile, the Raiders have been held to seven points or fewer in two of their last three games. The offensive discrepancies are why the SportsLine Projection Model is backing the Cowboys to cover as 3.5-point favorites as one of its Monday best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Cowboys vs. Raiders is 49.5 points, according to the latest NFL odds. The model also sees value in playing the Clippers to cover as 5.5-point underdogs against the 76ers in NBA action. Also, one of SportsLine's top experts has a best bet on Oilers vs. Sabres in the NHL. Claim the latest DraftKings promo code, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins, plus 3 months of NBA League Pass free: Check out our DraftKings promo code review for full details.The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception.

Las Vegas has the No. 20 scoring defense (24.4 ppg allowed), and the Raiders have allowed at least 30 points in two of their last three games. Meanwhile, the model doesn't project the Raiders to be able to keep pace with Dallas' offense, whether the Cowboys are at their best or just average, as the Raiders rank 31st in scoring at 15.4 ppg this year. The model projects the Cowboys to cover in 57% of simulations. Back the Dallas at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Clippers (+5.5) vs. 76ers (-112)The Clippers have been hit hard with injuries this season, but so have the 76ers. Philadelphia will be without Joel Embiid (knee) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (knee). Paul George (knee) is questionable. The Clippers were hoping for a Big Three this year of James Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Bradley Beal, but Beal is out for the season with a hip injury, and Leonard has played just six games while dealing with a foot injury. Harden has done his part, though, averaging 26 points and nine assists per game this season, with Ivica Zubac adding 16.2 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. Harden is averaging 39 points over his last two games, and the Clippers went 1-1 with their loss coming by three points over that span. Meanwhile, the 76ers have lost two of their last three games and haven't covered a 5.5-point spread in any of their last three games. The model projects the Clippers to cover in 67% of simulations. Back the Clippers at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:Sabres (+1.5) vs. Oilers (-198) \"Bit of a trap game potential for Edmonton after winning a possible Cup Finals preview on Saturday at Carolina and then with Alex Ovechkin and the Caps up next.\" SportsLine expert Matt Severance said. \"The Oilers are 4-6-2 away. Buffalo is last in the Atlantic Division but 5-3-2 at home and off one of the team's better efforts of the year on Saturday in Detroit. The return of captain and blueliner Rasmus Dahlin, a former No. 1 overall pick, from a personal leave made an obvious difference in that huge comeback win.\" Back the Sabres at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets and 3 free months of NBA League Pass:\nWant more Monday Night Football, NBA, NHL picks?You've seen some of the model's Monday best bets.

    "body": "\n        After an extended wait for a donor organ, former NFL quarterback Bernie Kosar announced Monday that he received a liver transplant. Kosar, who underwent multiple procedures last week to address internal bleeding, said earlier in the day in a social media video that he was set to finally have the transplant surgery.\"I'm out, and I'm feeling good,\" Kosar said after the procedure. \"Ready to enjoy the rest of the week and rest of our lives.\"Kosar was initially set to receive the transplant last weekend, but the procedure was delayed as the donor organ was infected. The former Cleveland Browns star previously announced that doctors diagnosed him with cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson's disease. He now has reason for optimism with regard to one of his ongoing health issues.\n\"It may not be Victory Monday on the football field, but here we are at 4:23 in the morning at University Hospital, and it's absolutely Victory Monday for me,\" Kosar said. \"Looking forward to literally heading on down right now to get that liver transplant. As you get ready for something monumental and transformative like this in your life, you can't help but be a little reflective. As I go down here today, I think about all the awesome, awesome support and fans out there and my amazing children and family and stuff.\"\nDespite his health issues, Kosar maintains his sense of humor and unabashed love for the Browns. Last week, he jokingly embraced his \"Steelers black and gold regulation University Hospital attire\" while awaiting one of his procedures.After he led the Miami Hurricanes to the 1983 national championship, Kosar entered the NFL's supplemental draft with the intention of landing with his favorite team, the Browns. Cleveland successfully secured the Ohio native, and he proceeded to build a legendary career with his hometown team over nearly a decade as its starting quarterback.\nKosar earned a Pro Bowl selection in 1987, guided the Browns to four playoff appearances in five years and etched his name into team and NFL history. He set multiple league records, including the most consecutive playoff games with three touchdowns and most consecutive completed passes without an interception. He later signed with the Dallas Cowboys and won a Super Bowl in his first year with the franchise, serving as backup to Troy Aikman.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Usually, the most interesting moves of the offseason are the ones where a player changes teams. Preferably, unexpectedly, with a dramatic change in circumstances that necessitates a wholesale re-evaluation of that player's outlook. John Naylor's return to the Mariners is a rare exception. Seattle's is an extremely pitcher-friendly home park, and some players – *cough Eugenio Suarez *cough* – seem completely overwhelmed by the park's offense-suppressing ways. A premier free agent signing with the Mariners is usually the kind of move that requires a big downgrade in the Fantasy rankings, or at least a sincere reappraisal of that player's value. But in Naylor's case, that might not be so. As a hitter, Naylor more than held his own in Seattle, hitting .299/.341/.490 in 54 games after he was traded there last summer, and while that's an awfully small sample size to go on, it's a compelling one. Naylor is a rare hitting talent; he's not necessarily an elite hitter with tremendous traits, or anything like that. No, what makes Naylor so special is that he's an endlessly adaptable hitter. He has a good approach at the plate and has really strong contact skills, but he also has more than enough power that pitchers can't just attack the zone with fastballs and dare him to do something with them. He'll take a walk, but he isn't hunting them; he'll dump a homer into the right field bleachers, but it's not all he's trying to do; he'll dump a single the other way, but it's not his goal every time he gets up there. It's a skill set that has allowed him to thrive in Cleveland, Arizona, and now Seattle, where he has hit .304/.335/.534 in 163 career plate appearances.\nGreat, so Naylor is the same guy he's always been, right? Uh, yeah, not so much. Along with his move to Seattle last summer was one of the most unexpected skill changes I've ever seen: Naylor suddenly became an elite baserunner. Naylor's never been a zero on the basepaths, stealing as many as 10 bases in 2023 despite being a slow baserunner. He was more active than usual before the trade to Seattle, swiping 11 in 93 games, but once he landed with the Mariners, he became one of the most prolific base stealers in the game. In those 54 games, he managed to swipe 19 bases without being caught stealing even once. And if you thought maybe he was just taking advantage of a lack of defensive attention in the dog days of summer – many of his steals came without even a cursory throw to second – he also stole two bases in 12 postseason games. Okay, that isn't quite the 60-steal pace he was on with the Mariners in the regular season, but it's a sign that he wasn't shy, either. And, in case you're wondering if Naylor might be, let's say, \"sneaky fast\" … nope! He was in the third percentile in sprint speed last season, by far the slowest player to steal 30 bases in the Statcast era – the second slowest was Juan Soto in 2025, who was in the 13th percentile, and before that it was Kyle Tucker in 2023, who was in the 33rd percentile. Naylor was extremely slow. Slower than any player who has stolen this many bases since at least 2015. \nHow did he manage those steals? Well, he got great jumps, predictably; among 226 players with at least 500 stolen base opportunities, only 12 gained more distance between when the pitcher began their delivery and when they released the ball, per StatCast data. Of the names ahead of him, only Agustin Ramirez was a base stealer of any renown. Naylor was incredibly opportunistic, but it's not like it is reflected in the rest of his baserunning stats. Taking his overall baserunning exploits into account, Statcast has him just about as an average baserunner in 2025. That was a big improvement from 2024, but it still highlights the fact that Naylor didn't actually become an incredible baserunner overnight – he just got a lot better at the one part of baserunning we care about for Fantasy.Is that a projectable skill moving forward? My guess is now, and that we'll see a similar regression with Naylor as we saw from Willy Adames a year ago – he stole 21 bases in his contract year in 2024 before falling back to 12 in 2025. That was still the second-highest mark of his career, but it was much more in line with what he had done before. For Naylor, that would imply something like 15 steals as a reasonable expectation, which would be a nice bonus for an otherwise only pretty good hitting first baseman, but not a difference-making number.\nBut with his return to Seattle … maybe that's underselling him? I don't think you should draft Naylor in 2026, expecting him to be a 30-steal guy again, but I would have said there was basically no chance of a repeat if he landed somewhere else. In Seattle, where he was, again, on a near-30-steal pace? Well, 30 might be possible, if not quite likely. How do you bake that into his price in drafts? Well, I still think I would keep Naylor outside of the top seven at first base, which pretty much represents the top two tiers at the position. But I do think Naylor's return to Seattle might be enough of a tiebreaker to bump him ahead of the likes of Vinnie Pasquantino and Ben Rice in the third tier, similar hitters who don't have any stolen base upside. A pick around 65th overall feels like the right place to slot Naylor in, and you'll be getting a good batting average (even for a first baseman) and rare steals from the position; he should also be a very good source of RBI in a good lineup, thanks to his contact-heavy approach. \n            ",

The deal will be worth $92.5 million and includes a no-trade clause, according to FanSided. This marks the first major free-agent signing of the offseason. Naylor, 28, is coming off a 2025 season in which he slashed .295/.353/.462 in a combined 147 games for the Diamondbacks and Mariners. Seattle acquired Naylor from Arizona leading up to the trade deadline. After the trade, Naylor had an OPS+ of 138 in 54 regular-season games for the Mariners en route to their winning the American League West title for the first time since 2001. Naylor in the ALCS batted .417 with three home runs. The Mariners lost that series in seven games to the Toronto Blue Jays.Naylor in 2024 as a member of the Guardians earned his first and thus far only All-Star selection. For his career, he owns an OPS+ of 116 with a WAR of 8.4 over parts of seven MLB seasons. \nComing into the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Naylor as the No. 23 available free agent in the class. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's write-up: To oppose Naylor is to grow weary of his excitable, borderline vexatious qualities. To embrace him is to grow appreciative of his skilled offensive game, particularly against righties. Naylor has a knack for squaring up the ball that, when combined with his strength and pull-and-lift tendencies, enables him to launch 20ish home runs annually. It's to be seen if his next employer lets him run as freely as the Mariners did, but even if not he should remain a worthy most-days option at the cold corner. Seattle this winter is aiming for as much roster continuity as possible as they remain in contending mode. \"Same goals, same priorities,\" general manager Justin Hollander told reporters at the recent GM meetings in Las Vegas. \"I think No. 1 for us is ideally keeping as much of the group that we had last year, that we really believed in, together. And then filling in the rest of the roster as required. Our offseason is largely going to start with the guys who were on the team last year and try to bring as many back as possible.\"\nWith Naylor now back in the fold, the M's may turn their attention to their two remaining notable free agents, third baseman Eugenio Suárez and infielder Jorge Polanco. \n            \n    ",

These chargers were issued Monday by Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson. Irving, 27, is accused of shooting and killing Beam last week at the Laney Fieldhouse sports facility. Beam, 66, died the next morning, hours after Irving was located following a manhunt. Dickson said that Beam's shooting, in addition to a second shooting last week at Oakland's Skyline High School, has led to her office to reinstitute mandatory minimum sentences in gun cases in Alameda County. \nDickson did not relate details about Beam's shooting, and police have not released any information about a motive in the shooting, which is being called a \"very targeted incident.\" Dickson did confirm that Irving made statements to police officers about the shooting, but did not provide details about what was said.\n        \n            \n                Bears' Nahshon Wright pays tribute to late coach John Beam with interception: 'That one was for him'\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile he was not a student or an employee at Laney College, Irving was known to be a loiter around the camps area.

He spent 25 years as a high school coach that included 17 seasons as Skyline's head coach (compiling a 160-33-3 record that included 15 Oakland Athletic League championships and 11 Oakland Section titles) before joining Laney's staff in 2004. \nBeam was promoted to head coach in 2012 and remained in that position through the 2024 season.

    "body": "\n        The San Antonio Spurs announced star big man Victor Wembanyama will miss time with a left calf strain suffered in a loss to the Warriors on Friday night. Wembanyama sat out the Spurs' win over the Kings on Sunday night and is now expected to be out of action for at least a few weeks, per Shams Charania. A firm timetable for his return was not provided, but the San Antonio Express-News reports he will be re-evaluated in two or three weeks.   Wembanyama has gotten off to a phenomenal start to his third season in the league, averaging 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.1 steals per game on 50.2/34.5/85.7 shooting splits. Thanks to Wembanyama's emergence as one of the game's most dominant two-way figures, the Spurs have raced out to a 9-4 record and sit in fifth place in the Western Conference.If he were to miss three weeks of action, that would mean Wembanyama would be out for 10 games. For a player who became the early yet heavy favorite to win Defensive Player of the Year and put himself at least in the conversation for Most Valuable Player, a 10-game absence would leave him with little margin to fulfill the NBA's new 65-game requirement for major individual awards. \nWembanyama would only be able to miss seven additional games the remainder of the season to retain award eligibility. Given teams generally ease players back into action after calf strains -- limit the number of back-to-backs they play -- his awards candidacy could be in serious jeopardy. Thunder big man Chet Holmgren (+130) moved into being the new DPOY favorite at FanDuel, with Wembanyama (+400) sliding to second with the news of his injury. On the court, the Spurs will have to lean on De'Aaron Fox, Stephon Castle and their talented backcourt in Wembanyama's absence. San Antonio's performance against Sacramento offered a glimpse into how they can still find success without Wembanyama, pushing the tempo and leaning on their offensive talent without their defensive anchor on the floor. Luke Kornet got the start at center against the Kings and veteran Kelly Olynyk moved into the backup role. The Spurs will have two more home games to figure out their plan without Wembanyama before a heavy road stretch with six of their next seven games away from San Antonio, including difficult matchups with Denver, Minnesota, Orlando and Cleveland. \nvs. Grizzliesvs. Hawksat Sunsat Blazersat Nuggetsat Timberwolvesvs. Grizzliesat Magic at CavaliersOnly 1.5 games separate the Spurs in fifth from the Suns in eighth in the West, and the next few weeks will be a serious early season challenge for Mitch Johnson's group in learning how to handle adversity without their star. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Ole Miss Rebels are 10-1, have secured a third consecutive double-digit-win season -- a first in program history -- and are on the cusp of their first College Football Playoff berth as well.But after a win over Florida and with an open date upcoming this weekend, all eyes and ears and rumors surrounding the Rebels are focused on what coach Lane Kiffin's next move will be ... if there is one.Florida, which Kiffin's team beat 34-24 thanks to a second-half rally, and LSU are hot on the trail trying to whisk the 50-year-old coach away from Oxford, Mississippi, and the Tigers upped the ante Monday, sending a private plane to Oxford to pick up members of the Kiffin family and give them a tour of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, per Wilson Alexander of The Advocate.In addition to the Baton Rouge trip, a Kiffin family member visited Gainesville, Florida, on Sunday as the Gators ramp up their pursuit of the Rebels coach, sources confirmed to CBS Sports' John Talty and Richard Johnson. \nAs CBS Sports reported Monday morning, there's been a recent shift regarding the prospects of Kiffin staying with the Rebels.A few weeks ago those around Oxford were confident Kiffin would return. Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which represents Kiffin, was engaging the Rebels in extension talks. The College Football Playoff not beginning until Dec. 19 seemed to work in the program's favor (the Rebels are almost assuredly in). The tenor has shifted in recent weeks. There's considerably less confidence now that Kiffin will stay in Oxford as several sources CBS Sports talked to believe it is more likely he'll leave. Meanwhile, others in the last 24 hours have expressed optimism he'll stay. Frankly, Kiffin is someone whose mind can change from day to day.There are questions in his camp about the political infrastructure in Baton Rouge. There are also concerns for Kiffin about his potential alignment with the Florida administration. \n        \n            \n                Latest coaching intel: Lane Kiffin's decision a true soap opera, Auburn search focuses on four names\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLSU, ranked ninth in the preseason AP Poll, is a disappointing 6-4 (3-4 SEC) and fired Brian Kelly last month. Florida, ranked 15th in the preseason AP Poll, has cratered to 3-7 (2-5 SEC) and fired Billy Napier last month, one week before LSU fired Kelly.\nKiffin owns a 115-53 (.685) career record, including a 54-19 (.740) mark at Ole Miss. The Rebels are averaging 494 yards per game this season, third in FBS, and are nearly assured of a spot in the Playoff. After a bye week this weekend, they face Mississippi State in their annual Egg Bowl rivalry meeting Nov. 28.\n            ",

The total he'll be out: $507,156.Ramsey was ejected from Pittsburgh's 34-12 win over the Bengals after throwing a punch at Chase early in the fourth quarter. He said afterward that his actions were the byproduct of Chase spitting on him, an accusation that Chase denied. Referee Bill Vinovich said afterward that his crew did not see Chase spit on Ramsey. The NFL, however, clearly determined that Chase did in fact spit on the Steelers' free safety. \nChase's suspension is in line with what Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter received after he spit on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott back in Week 1. Carter, who spit on Prescott prior to the game starting, was ejected for the entirety of that game and was also fined $57,222, which for Carter was the equivalent of losing a game check. Chase's absence will be a significant blow for a Bengals team that has won just one game since losing quarterback Joe Burrow to injury back in Week 2. \nA Pro Bowl receiver each of the past four years, Chase led the NFL with 76 receptions through 11 weeks. He wasn't much of a factor in Cincinnati's latest loss, however, as he caught just 3 of 10 targets for 30 yards during the Bengals' loss to the Steelers. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Starting pitching stands at the heart of the Red Sox's needs this offseason. And, a league source told CBS Sports, Boston plans on re-engaging with the Twins on a possible trade for All-Star Joe Ryan.With Ryan, the 29-year-old pitcher who the Red Sox tried to acquire at the trade deadline, they would have a certified No. 2 starter. The team relied heavily on Garrett Crochet last year, describing him as the stopper, and while it worked perhaps better than even they could have expected (2.59 ERA in 205 ⅓ innings), it's hard to rely on that again in 2026.\"Aces stop the losing streaks and they keep the winning streaks going,\" said Red Sox manager Alex Cora during the 2025 season. \"That's what he's doing.\"Put Ryan in the mix and the Sox add another arm who can spark runs and stop skids. A move like that would tell the rest of the league the Red Sox are still serious about winning.\nFor the first time since 2021, the 2025 roster actually made sense. Young players had real mileage on them and a little scar tissue. The veterans knew how to win. They added Alex Bregman, a guy who had never missed the postseason in his nine-year career. They traded for Crochet, the best lefty in their rotation since Chris Sale and David Price, even if the experience gap was obvious.And even after moving on from their linchpin in Rafael Devers and losing Roman Anthony's to a season-ending oblique injury in early September, the group carried them. No, they didn't win the division, but they did secure a postseason berth as the second wild card. Despite the quick playoff exit, the season was largely viewed as a success.Good starting pitching separates contenders in October. Great starting pitching wins the World Series. This year's World Series put the gap on full display, flashing what's ahead of the Red Sox for years to come. The Blue Jays were the best hitting team in baseball, period. The Dodgers weren't at their offensive peak, but their stars delivered when it mattered, pushing them to a second straight title and a third in six years.\nInside all of that was the real separator: starting pitching.\"What we've seen in the postseason is a disproportionate number of runs come via the home run,\" Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said at the GM meetings last week. \"That's because pitching is so good that it's really difficult to stack hit after hit and create a rally to push runs across the board. Additionally, the schedule of the postseason naturally allows a team to leverage its best starters and relievers night after night.\"Last August, the Red Sox front office believed they were close to landing Ryan, a move that the club was confident would change their postseason path. But the rumblings out of Minnesota told a different story. The Twins didn't think Boston came close to meeting their price. Initially, the Twins asked for Roman Anthony in the Ryan deal, which was a hard no for the Red Sox. Then they pivoted to prospects Franklin Arias and Payton Tolle and the Sox were ready to play ball.However, when the Twins countered again and asked for Jarren Duran or Wilyer Abreu, the Red Sox halted, not wanting to pull impact players off their big-league roster. In the end, a deal between the two sides fell apart.\nFast forward to now and the Twins are largely viewed as a club with no direction, marred by ownership dysfunction. Even with its August fire sale, Minnesota thought it would contend as early as 2027. Byron Buxton was initially adamant about seeing it through. Now, he's reportedly willing to waive his no-trade clause if it means he can join a contender.\"I think the Twins themselves do not know [if they will contend],\" one source familiar with the inner-workings of the organization told CBS Sports. \"I do not think ownership knows what it is doing there in terms of its budget. But they know their attendance and TV numbers were bad last year. I think they are more likely to trade Pablo Lopez because of the money he makes than Ryan. If they were to trade both, then I think Buxton would want out and no one would go to any games.\"Ryan comes with two more years of team control. He only made $3 million last year, a number that fits the Red Sox' penny-pinching approach over the last five or so seasons, and MLB Trade Rumors estimates his arbitration raise would still only hit $5.8 million for 2026. (López, on the other hand, is due more than $21 million next year.) Ryan's contract certainly wouldn't be an obstacle for the Red Sox.\nFurthermore, given the dysfunction and the likelihood that the Twins won't contend before 2027, the return they're looking for might not hinge on pulling big-league pieces from the Red Sox. The deal will look different.Lastly, given Ryan's second-half struggles last season (2.72 ERA in the first half against a 4.67 ERA after the break), a Crochet-Ryan pairing should not be seen as some far-fetched goal.\"As we continue to look for ways to improve the team, someone to pitch alongside Garrett is certainly one way to do that,\" Breslow said last week.\nThe Red Sox desperately need a middle-of-the-order bat, especially if they don't bring back Bregman. And there's no indication the club is prepared to stretch above its capabilities to keep him.Pete Alonso could be an immediate fix at first base with the oft-injured Triston Casas heading into 2026 with even more uncertainty. Maybe there's a trade to be made. If, somehow, the club is able to re-sign Bregman, then the Red Sox have something brewing.On the pitching side, Brayan Bello took a step forward, with Breslow saying he looked like a legitimate No. 2 starter. That's generous; Bello profiles more as a back-end arm at this stage. Tolle and Connelly Early are in the picture now, too, though one of them might have to be part of a deal to land someone like Ryan.\nSo could the Red Sox contend in 2026? Yes. But Ryan is the first step, not the solution.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Islam Makhachev beat Jack Della Maddalena even more dominantly than Makhachev's supporters expected at UFC 322. For Belal Muhammad, much of Makhachev's success came from things you can't easily see. Though Makahchev was a significant betting favorite at UFC 322, many saw potential in Della Maddalena's evolved grappling defense. Della Maddalena fended off six takedowns and minimized Belal Muhammad's ground control time to win the welterweight title in May. Against Makhachev, Della Maddalena managed to do little more than survive -- failing to stop a single takedown and spending more than 19 of the fight's 25 minutes on bottom.\"He was taking him down in the open and wouldn't let him get out of half  guard. Islam on top is very hard to get up from,\" Muhammad, a training partner of Makhachev's, told CBS Sports ahead of his fight with Ian Machado Garry on Saturday. \"If you've never felt it  before, you don't want your first time being in the cage. It's  shocking.\"You could tell for Jack, it was that same feeling. He got to  the point where he was giving up easier takedowns as the rounds went  deeper.\"\n\n        \n            \n                UFC 322 fight fallout: Islam Makhachev vs. Ilia Topuria at the White House among top fights to make\n                \n                    Shakiel Mahjouri                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMakhachev and UFC legend Khabib Nurmagomedov specialize in leveraging their entire body weight on the ground. The positioning requires a nuanced understanding of body awareness that escapes most fighters. \"They've been doing it their whole lives,\" Muhammad said. \"They use their whole body. So  many guys only use their upper half or lower half.\"Makhachev's ascent to welterweight champion puts Muhammad in a tricky position. Muhammad and Makhachev have repeatedly rejected the idea of fighting each other. Makhachev once confessed that Muhammad winning the welterweight title complicated matters and Muhammad had previously claimed he'd rather move up to middleweight than scrap with his teammate. Asked if this was Muhammad's last welterweight fight, particularly if he beats Garry, the former champ was noncommittal. \n\"No, I'm the top of the division,\" Muhammad said. \"For me, it's full focus on Ian Garry. It's about dominating Ian. Nothing else matters to me but this Saturday. Everyone will ask about the past or future; we're looking at the present. I need to remind the world of who I am.\"Muhammad clarified that he'd share more about his fighting future, in light of Makhachev's ascension, after Saturday. In the meantime, he's determined to leave an impression after Michael Morales and Carlos Prates elevated their stocks with knockout wins over Sean Brady and Leon Edwards, respectively, at UFC 322.\"For myself, I have to outperform both of them. Morales is a monster. I've trained with him...\" Muhammad said. \"I would definitely give it to Morales because Brady was on a really good streak, and Leon Edwards was on a losing streak. But to finish, Leon Edwards standing up, you have to give him props. He's been knocking all of these guys out. They're both monsters.\"\nMuhammad vs. Garry serves as the co-main event of UFC Fight Night in Al Rayyan, Qatar. The event is headlined by top lightweights Arman Tsarukyan and Dan Hooker.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Full disclosure: Talking about relief pitchers is my least favorite part of Fantasy Baseball. Pitching is already tough enough to figure out when you're basing things on a 150-inning sample size and mostly just trying to figure out who the best pitchers are. Relief pitcher is an inherently volatile position, both in terms of performance — since pitchers often have limited control over their outcomes — and in terms of health.Okay, great, now cut that sample size in half (at best). And then add in the fact that we're not just trying to figure out who the best pitchers are, but also which pitchers will be anointed by their manager as The Closer. Of course, it would be tough enough if we were just trying to figure out who will open the season as the closer, but we also have to try to weigh who has job security. Any individual piece of that is hard enough to predict; put them all together, and it's an almost impossible equation to solve.2025 was a good example of that. Among the top 12 relievers in ADP entering the season, only five were actually helping you in the saves category by August or September: Edwin Diaz (RP4 in ADP), Raisel Iglesias (RP7), Andres Munoz (RP9), Jhoan Duran (RP10), and Robert Suarez (RP12). And even that overstates how much value most drafters got out of Iglesias, who lost his job mid-season and was likely dropped in many leagues before getting the closer job back. The reasons for failure among the other seven were varied and unpredictable. Emmanuel Clase, of course, is his own situation, and we'll likely never see him pitch in an MLB game after his alleged role in a gambling scheme. Josh Hader and Felix Bautista got hurt, which could happen to anyone – though in Bautista's case, his elevated draft position was already a mistake, given the injury concerns coming into the season. Devin Williams pitched so poorly that he simply lost his job, while Mason Miller and Ryan Helsley were deadline additions to teams that already had established closers and found themselves demoted after their trades.  \nYou can come up with reasons why we should or should not have been able to see any of those coming, but the point is, the margins are inherently small here. Iglesias lost his job in early June on the strength of 24 bad innings – or the equivalent of four good starts or five to six poor starts. That he was able to right the ship and allow just a 1.25 ERA over his next 43.1 innings shouldn't exactly come as a surprise, since 24 innings just isn't a particularly compelling sample size. If your opinion about a player is changing based on a sample size that small, you're probably overreacting.But relief pitcher is the one position where you almost have to overreact to small samples, otherwise you can't react at all. It's also a position that feels especially unsettled ahead of the offseason, with as many as 20 closer jobs seemingly up for grabs. No matter what you think about the state of things in November, it's likely to change considerably by the time February and March roll around. 2025 Relief Pitcher ReviewAroldis Chapman, BOS: 61.1 - 1.17 - 85 - 32 - 0.70Edwin Diaz, NYM: 66.1 - 1.63 - 98 - 28 - 0.87Robert Suarez, SD: 69.2 - 2.97 - 75 - 40 - 0.90Jhoan Duran, PHI: 70 - 2.06 - 80 - 32 - 1.10Andres Munoz, SEA: 62.1 - 1.73 - 83 - 38 - 1.03Carlos Estevez, KC: 66 - 2.45 - 54 - 42 - 1.06Josh Hader, HOU: 52.2 - 2.05 - 76 - 28 - 0.85Drew Rasmussen, TB: 150 - 2.76 - 127 - 0 - 1.02David Bednar, NYY: 62.2 - 2.30 - 86 - 27 - 1.04Jeff Hoffman, TOR: 68 - 4.37 - 84 - 33 - 1.19Cade Smith, CLE: 73.2 - 2.93 - 104 - 16 - 1.00Adrian Morejon, SD: 73.2 - 2.08 - 70 - 3 - 0.90 \tBiggest Breakout from 2025Aroldis ChapmanIt would be natural to refer to this more as a \"return to form\" for Chapman, but you could make the case that this was arguably the best version of him we've ever seen. Okay, sure, the strikeout rate wasn't quite as gaudy as it was early in his career, but 37.3% is still an extremely healthy mark. Especially when coupled with a walk rate nearly half his career mark, plus the best quality of contact of his career, leading to a 2.06 xERA that Chapman has bested only once since 2015. Is betting on that bounceback to sustain into his age-38 season the smart bet? Probably not, and Chapman has moved up significantly in drafts so far, ranking as the No. 6 reliever in early NFBC drafts with an ADP of 68.2. He'll go later than that in most drafts, but Chapman is clearly going to cost a lot more than he has in recent years, and given the year-to-year volatility, it probably makes more sense to fade him this year than buy in. \n \tBiggest Bust from 2025Emmanuel ClaseThere's no lesson to learn here. Clase was arguably the best reliever in baseball, and then he was placed on administrative leave in the middle of the season as part of an investigation into sports betting. He was recently indicted by the Eastern District of New York for his part in a sports betting scheme and will almost certainly never pitch in MLB again. But that one's a bummer, and there's nothing we can really take away from it, so let's look at someone else here. As mentioned earlier, there is unfortunately no shortage of options to choose from. Devin Williams Williams came back from a serious back injury in 2024 and looked like himself. When he started pitching for the Yankees as the closer to open the 2025 season, he also mostly looked like himself. His fastball was within one mph of where it has been since 2022, for example, while his changeup continued to defy physics. He struck 35% of opposite hitters and walked just 9.7%, his best rate since 2020 … and he was awful. He finished the season with a 4.79 ERA and lost the closer's job a few weeks into the season; when the Yankees tried him back in that role again, things went better for a month or two, but he was bad enough in the summer months that the Yankees felt they had to completely rebuild their bullpen at the deadline. \nWilliams' underlying skills weren't nearly as unsightly as his actual production, and some team is going to convince themselves this offseason that he should be a closer again. And you know what: I agree! I'll buy the dip on Williams if he ends up closing somewhere. I still think he can be a must-start Fantasy option.  \tBiggest rankings movers from 2025 to 2026Up: Andres Munoz; Aroldis Chapman; David Bednar; Cade SmithIn Muñoz's case, the Mariners simply stopped treating him like a fireman and started treating him like a more traditional closer. He was as dominant as ever and bumped his save total from 22 to 38 as a result, and we expect that usage to remain. He's one of the best closers in baseball, though notably, he hasn't quite shown that 100-strikeout upside we're looking for from the truly elite options in Fantasy in a few years. The Yankees have the kind of resources that make it hard to assume even a very good reliever will remain the closer forever, but I do think it's probably safe to assume Bednar will be the closer in 2026. He bounced back from a miserable 2024 with a 2.30 ERA and 12.4 K/9 and should be closing for a 90-plus win team, so while there is some risk that he stumbles again, I have enough faith in Bednar to rank him as a top-12 option, at least. \nSmith probably just needs to be a top-five closer for 2026. He only has 17 career saves, but he has been one of the best relievers in baseball since entering the league – by FIP, he's been the best over the past two seasons combined, and he's top-12 by ERA, too. Elite strikeouts, great control, and he pitches for a team that has created multiple 40-save seasons in recent years. He very well could be the best closer in fantasy. Down: Devin Williams; Ryan Helsley; Raisel IglesiasIglesias should come at a slight discount relative to recent years in 2026 drafts, and as long as he ends up somewhere as a closer, it's a discount you should be willing to take. His skill set has slipped a bit in recent seasons, but his 3.21 ERA was backed up by a 3.17 xERA and 3.31 FIP in 2025, so it's not like there's been a giant collapse. Iglesias played a big part in the Braves' early-season struggles in 2025, but he still has the look of a reliable closer, if not quite an elite one anymore. Helsley was apparently tipping his pitches when he got to the Mets, which helps explain his disastrous results after the deadline. Is that going to be enough to convince some team to make him their closer this offseason? I'd be willing to bet on it, and I'd be willing to bet on Helsley bouncing back in 2026 if he gets that chance. Expecting him to return to being an elite closer again might be risky, but if his price remains outside of the top-150 on Draft Day, it's a bet I'm willing to make. \n Offseason preview  \tWho needs an upgrade most?  Blue JaysOriolesRaysBravesMets MarlinsNationalsCubsPiratesRedsAthleticsRangersDodgersDiamondbacksGiantsSo … half the league? There are closer candidates in many of those places, such as Toronto, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't and won't seek an upgrade – the Blue Jays have already hinted at as much. The focus should obviously be on the contenders of this group, like the Blue Jays, Mets, Cubs, and Dodgers, and we expect Edwin Diaz to end up on at least one of these teams.An interesting situation is San Diego's. Robert Suarez is a free agent, but they still have Mason Miller in-house as arguably the dominant bullpen arm. But with big question marks in the rotation, there has been plenty of buzz that the Padres will look to use him as a starting pitcher. Nobody in San Diego presumably cares about my opinion on this, but … this would be a terrible idea. Dating back to his days in college, Miller has managed to make double-digit starts just three times in nine seasons, including just 13 in 2023 between the majors and minors, when he dealt with a sprained UCL almost immediately upon his promotion to the majors. There is basically no evidence that Miller can hold up to a starter's workload in his career. I know the Padres had recent success with another reliever-to-starter transition, but the key difference is, MIchael King had thrown 100-plus innings on four separate occasions by that point; Miller has never even reached 95. If Miller does transition to the rotation, I think he'll be on my \"Do-Not-Draft\" list. \n \tTop impending free agents Edwin DiazRobert SuarezPete FairbanksKenley JansenDevin WilliamsRaisel IglesiasEmilio PaganKyle FinneganMost of these guys will end up closing somewhere, and they'll have value if they do. Diaz and Suarez in particular will likely be top-12 options wherever they land, and Jansen, Fairbanks, and Iglesias won't be far from that range, either.Williams is probably the most interesting name here, because I could see him settling for a one-year, prove-it deal and absolutely shoving. As noted earlier, I don't think there was a dramatic drop-off in talent here, so the possibility of a bounce-back season is tantalizing at what should be a significantly discounted price. He might just be cooked, of course, but if you don't want to pay the price for an elite closer, you have to take on some risk. Williams could be worth the risk.  \tTrade candidatesTanner ScottJeff HoffmanJose AlvaradoRafael MonteroA.J. MinterBlake TreinenRobert StephensonThere are a lot more than this, of course, but these are some of the big names who could potentially land in a spot where they could figure into the closer role. Scott and Hoffman could still begin the 2026 season as their respective team's top closer options, of course, though that seems unlikely given how their 2025 seasons ended. \n            ",

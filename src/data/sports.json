    "body": "\n        Toronto Blue Jays star George Springer exited Monday night's World Series Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers with what the team is calling \"right side discomfort.\" Springer, who was replaced by veteran infielder Ty France, was also forced out of a game during the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners when he was hit on the right knee by an errant pitch from right-hander Bryan Woo.Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Springer had gotten an MRI and the team was awaiting the results of the test.\"We'll see how it comes back and see how he walks up tomorrow,\" Schneider said. \"But it sucks. He's obviously a huge part of our lineup. Glad I got him out when I did and hopefully it didn't make anything worse, but we'll see how he is tomorrow.\"Springer, 36, called for the training staff after taking a first-pitch swing to open the top of the seventh. He grabbed at his right side, and while there's not word yet on what injury he suffered, that tends to be the universal sign of an oblique or intercoastal strain. Here's a look at the play in question:\nSpringer entered Game 3 hitting .259/.339/.593 with four home runs and nine runs batted in over the course of his first 13 postseason games this month. Springer had been one of the main talking points entering Game 3, with reporters asking manager John Schneider (among others) about how Dodger Stadium's crowd was likely to receive him. Keep in mind, the Dodgers felt wronged by Springer for his employment by the Houston Astros during their sign-stealing scandal. \"I know he's prepared for it. He's been dealing with that for a long time,\" ,\" Schneider said Monday. \"It kind of is what it is. I think me, the manager in me, I probably get more mad than he does because you always have this like protective mode of your players.\n\"But I don't think it can galvanize a team, I don't think that it will directly affect what anyone is doing, and I don't think it's going to affect anything George is doing. George is arguably one of the best World Series performers in the history of the game. So I think that fans, they show their opinion or emotion, that's fine. George has an unbelievable ability to keep himself focused and present on what he's doing.\"\n            ",

In the process, Ohtani became the first player with at least four extra-base knocks in a single World Series contest since 1906, as well as the first player to ever reach base nine times in a single playoff gameOhtani doubled in his first at-bat to lead off the bottom of the first against Blue Jays right-hander Max Scherzer; homered in his second trip to the plate in the bottom of the third (at the time giving the Dodgers a 2-0 lead); doubled again in his third at-bat in the bottom of the fifth (plating another run); and then tied the game at 5-5 in the bottom of the seventh with his second blast.Here's a look at the second home run in video form:Ohtani was intentionally walked in each of his next four plate appearances, then unintentionally in the 17th inning.\nOhtani's performance tied him with Chicago White Sox utility player Frank Isbell, whose own four extra-base hit World Series outing saw him double four times in Game 5 of the 1906 Fall Classic against the Chicago Cubs. The White Sox would go on to win that series in six games.The two-way superstar also became the first player in Major League Baseball history with three multi-home run games during a single postseason, though that fact can be owed (at least in part) to the expanded tournament. He had previously launched multiple home runs in both Game 4 of the NLCS and Game 1 of the NLDS.Ohtani's 12 total bases tied him with Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth for the third most in a single World Series contest. Albert Pujols delivered 14 total bases in Game 3 of the 2011 Fall Classic, while Pablo Sandoval delivered 13 as part of Game 1 in 2012.\nThe Dodgers scraped out an 18th-inning walk-off win on a Freddie Freeman home run.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Minnesota Timberwolves announced Monday that star guard Anthony Edwards was diagnosed with a right hamstring strain after undergoing an MRI. Edwards had left the team's win over the Indiana Pacers on Sunday with hamstring tightness. The team said he will be re-evaluated in one week. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Edwards will miss at least two weeks. If Edwards misses two full weeks, he'll be out for seven games, the first of which was the team's 127-114 loss to the Denver Nuggets on Monday. His absence will be a blow to the Timberwolves, especially in a loaded Western Conference where a few wins could be the difference between a top-six seed and a spot in the Play-In Tournament, but it is not the end of the world. The bigger issue for the Timberwolves is that Edwards' injury highlights their already shaky backcourt situation. Shortly before the team's season opener against the Portland Trail Blazers, news broke that Donte DiVincenzo would replace Mike Conley in the starting lineup. The 38-year-old Conley has been a key part of the Timberwolves run to back-to-back Western Conference finals in the last two seasons, but has been showing signs of decline along the way. \nThe early signs this season suggest that he may be no longer be a key rotation player. Entering Monday, Conley was averaging three points and 1.7 assists on 16.7% shooting in 15.3 minutes. He was decent in a starting role against the Nuggets -- 10 points and four assists on 3 of 8 from the field -- but his first week is still concerning. DiVincenzo is an excellent role player, and is once again shooting the ball well on high volume -- 38.5% on 6.5 3-pointers per game -- but he's not a point guard. He's going to have to take on a good amount of that responsibility, however, especially with Edwards out. How does that impact the other facets of his game? Here are the Timberwolves' guards beyond Edwards, DiVincenzo and Conley:Bones Hyland Jaylen ClarkTerrence Shannon Jr.Rob DillinghamJohnny JuzangThere are a lot of question marks about that group, and you wouldn't call any of them true point guards. Hyland is the only one with any sort of proven track record in the league, and he nearly shot himself out of the league. Clark and Shannon have shown some flashes, but is either ready to take on a big role on a team that's expecting to contend in the West? Dillingham, the No. 8 pick in the 2024 draft, has barely played since arriving in Minnesota, and Juzang is an end of the bench guy. \nWhile the Wolves got off to a great start against the Nuggets, they completely fell apart in the fourth quarter. When the game tightened up, they couldn't generate enough good looks and managed just 20 points on 6 of 25 from the field. Late-game offense isn't as much of an issue when Edwards is healthy, but the fourth quarter was a glimpse at their remaining backcourt depth's limitations. For the game, DiVincenzo, Conley, Hyland, Shannon and Dillingham combined for 39 points on 12 of 34 (35.3%) with 12 assists. (Clark sat out with a calf injury and Juzang only played garbage time.) It's also worth noting that none of them had any chance of slowing down Jamal Murray, who poured in 43 points on the other end. Even when Edwards comes back, the Wolves' backcourt concerns aren't going away -- especially if Conley cannot turn things around. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        LOS ANGELES -- This was the type of game where you drop to your knees and thank heavens you decided, at whatever point, to become a baseball fan. I found myself thinking in the seventh inning that if you just randomly brought a non-baseball fan to this game, they'd immediately become a die-hard fan, hooked for the rest of their life. It was almost like -- just a few miles from Hollywood -- the game was scripted for maximum entertainment. It lasted 18 innings and ended on another Freddie Freeman walk-off home run, just like Game 1 of last year's World Series. This one was a solo shot to dead center field. The thousands of fans who were still in attendance shot to their feet and roared, soon serenaded with \"I love L.A.\" It was a 6-5 Dodgers win in 18 innings.The extra-innings portion of the game dragged and, let's face it, no one who had never seen baseball before would want to be here for almost seven hours. For those first 7-9 innings, though, it was breathtaking and the whole game provided plenty of quirky twists and turns. And then a walk-off home run. All's well that ends well. \"It's one of the greatest World Series games of all time,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. \"Emotional. I'm spent emotionally.\"\nI've been to some amazing games. I thought about the walk-off grand slam last year, Game 7 in 2016 (because of course I did), Game 5 in 2017, Game 6 in 2011 and so many more. There were more dramatic endings in that list, more weight-of-history games in there and higher-scoring affairs, but this one was incredible theater like only a few others have had in recent World Series history. Again, if we limited our scope to nine innings, it was only missing the dramatic ending. And in extras, there were plenty of close calls. There was a ton of traffic on the bases. The two teams combined to leave 37 men on base. Both teams were tantalizingly close multiple times to taking this one in extras before the 18th, when the Blue Jays stranded runners on second and third base before the Freeman walk-off.There were even storylines that went beyond this particular game. Remember, this is the first-ever World Series meeting between the Blue Jays and Dodgers. There's history with George Springer from the 2017 Astros, and he's been showered with boos like I've rarely heard before. We had an all-time great pitcher starting on the mound for the Blue Jays in Max Scherzer. Even post-prime Scherzer at age 41 was pretty good for the most part. He looked like vintage Mad Max for a few moments. And Shohei Ohtani was responsible for RBI on two of the three runs charged to Scherzer. Can't really blame him there. \nDid I say Ohtani? Yes, the best baseball player in the world was front and center in this one. Again. He led off with a double. Then he hit a home run. Then he doubled home an important run during a game-tying rally. Next time up, with the Dodgers trailing again, he again tied it. This time with a home run. That's 12 total bases, two shy of the World Series record. After that home run, Ohtani was 9 for his last 15 with six home runs and two doubles. Are you kidding me with this? It's about the time someone misguidedly says, \"you can't make this stuff up!\" Yeah, you could. We could do it in a movie. Before Ohtani came about, though, most people would've deemed the movie unrealistic, even before you consider the pitching.That's how good he is. The Blue Jays realized what was going on and intentionally walked him the rest of the game. Yes, four intentional walks before he took a four-pitch walk where every pitch was far out of the strike zone. The ol' unintentional intentional walk. Ohtani got on base nine times. That's a record both for the regular season and postseason. \nThis game wasn't all Ohtani. Far from it. He was a main character, but there were plenty of other huge moments. We saw the Dodgers jump out to a 1-0 lead in the second on a Teoscar Hernández home run. It was his sixth of the playoffs in 13 games. Ohtani's homer in the third came next, putting the Dodgers up 2-0. The door was left open for a Blue Jays rally in the fourth on a Tommy Edman error and the Jays burst through that door. An Alejandro Kirk three-run home run gave them the lead and they tacked on another run after that. Kirk, by the way, had 15 homers and 76 RBI in 130 regular-season games. In the playoffs, he now has five home runs and 13 RBI in 14 games.\nThe Dodgers answered in the fifth, as Ohtani hit an RBI double and Freddie Freeman drove him home with a shot down the first-base line. That same first-base line came into play (again) in the seventh when the Blue Jays took the lead (again). Vladimir Guerrero Jr. singled and Bo Bichette -- hobbled leg and all -- sent a shot right down that same line. A wicked carom off some broadcasting equipment gave a bit of extra time to help Guerrero score from first, barely. He even did a fun slap of home plate to beat the tag. And then Ohtani tied it with the seventh-inning homer.There were all kinds of quirky plays mixed in. A runner was thrown out at third after trying to advance on an infield hit. A ball hit off Freeman's glove in the eighth for a hit, but then a runner trying to go from first to third was thrown out. There were close calls on the bases. Freeman was thrown out at home on a not-so-close call. There was even a play where a runner on first base was picked off because he thought a batter had drawn a walk, though it was called a strike instead of a ball. The top of the 10th ended with a runner being thrown out at the plate with his star teammate on deck.\nIn fact, Edman made two of those throws, redeeming himself for that bad error earlier.There was a play at third base in the 11th where the defender tried to field a possible infield hit with two runners on by standing with a foot on the bag while he grabbed the ball. It didn't work. The runner was safe. Man, we had so many quirky plays.A starting pitcher who temporarily converted to closer had to come in and get five outs to finish the ninth. He was followed by another starter who is coming out of the bullpen this October.\nAnd then another all-time great, Clayton Kershaw, entered in the 11th with the bases loaded. He's in his final season and gave up five runs in two innings in his NLDS outing and hadn't pitched since. He faced a 31-year-old in Nathan Lukes, who spent 10 years in the minors. He fouled off two 3-2 pitches before grounding out softly to end the inning. Will Klein, who had one inning of playoff experience and less than 23 innings of regular-season experience in his career threw four scoreless innings for the Dodgers in relief. He'd never previously gone more than two innings in an MLB outing.Drama. Fun. Redemption. Historically great players going at it. Marathon extra innings with several tease jobs. Game 3 of the 2025 World Series truly had it all.\n            ",

Moore and the University withdrew their respective appeals on Sept. 29 and Oct. 6., according to ESPN. In August, the NCAA Committee on Infractions announced that Michigan committed multiple Level I violations regarding impermissible off campus scouting. More specifically, the committee determined that Michigan created a system designed to stealing opponents' signs during the 2021, 2022 and part of the 2023 season. While they have been handed fines that could total $30 million, Michigan was able to avoid a postseason ban and the vacating of past victories, most especially the program's 2023 national championship, the school's first since 1997 when they shared the title with Nebraska. \n        \n            \n                Marcus Freeman, Sherrone Moore advocate for return of Notre Dame vs. Michigan rivalry\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMoore was handed a two-year show-cause order and was suspended for three games across two seasons. He sat out two of Michigan's games earlier this season and is slated to sit out next year's season-opener against Western Michigan. \nFormer Michigan coach and current Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh was hit with a 10-year show-cause penalty for his involvement in the scandal. While the penalty won't impact his current situation with the Chargers, it would make it extremely difficult for him to land another college coaching job as that institution would need to justify his hiring to the NCAA. Michigan's football program's rise under Harbaugh coincided with the team's sign stealing scandal. The Wolverines won 64.4% of their games from 2017-20 before winning 93% of their games from 2021-23. The later stretch included three straight wins over an Ohio State team that had been 5-0 against Harbaugh-led Michigan teams prior to the 2021 season. \nMoore, who is currently in his second full season as Michigan's coach, has guided this year's team to an 6-2 start. The Wolverines, who are currently No. 21 in the AP poll, will face Purdue this Saturday at \"the Big House.\" \n            \n    ",

The Blue Jays are looking for their first title since back-to-back wins in 1992 and 1993.The Jays punched their ticket to the Fall Classic with an ALCS Game 7 win over the Seattle Mariners. This is Toronto's first World Series appearance since 1993, when they won their second consecutive title. The Dodgers thoroughly dismantled the Milwaukee Brewers, owners of MLB's best record during the regular season, in the NLCS to return to the World Series. They are the first defending champion to reach the World Series the next season since the 2008-09 Philadelphia Phillies, and, in more than a few ways, this year's Dodgers are better than last year's.The Blue Jays (94-68) have home-field advantage over the Dodgers (93-69) in the World Series because they had the better regular-season record.

This marks the first standard NBA contract McClung has signed. The Pacers will reportedly waive former No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman to create room on roster. The 26-year-old guard, who went undrafted in 2021 out of Texas Tech, has appeared in a total of six NBA games for the Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers, Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. McClung has averaged 5.5 points, 2.2 assists and 2.3 rebounds per game while shooting 43% from the field. McClung won NBA G League MVP while playing for the Osceola Magic in 2024. He has also been named All-NBA G League First Team in each of the last two seasons. McClung is known for his incredible dunking ability, which made him famous in his high school years. \nIn 2023, McClung was invited to participate in the NBA Slam Dunk Contest while on a two-way contract with the 76ers, and recorded perfect 50s on all of his dunks minus one. He defeated Trey Murphy III in the final. McClung returned and repeated as dunk champion in 2024, and then became the first player in NBA history to win the dunk contest three years in a row in 2025. Nate Robinson is the only other NBA player to win the dunk contest three times.\nThe Pacers are off to an 0-3 start following last year's 50-32 campaign, which ended in the NBA Finals. Indiana is dealing with a number of injuries, which led them to turn to McClung. Tyrese Haliburton will of course miss the entire season due to the torn Achilles he suffered in June, then Bennedict Mathurin (toe), Obi Toppin (hamstring), Andrew Nembhard (shoulder), Taelon Peter (groin) and Johnny Furphy (foot) are all banged up as well. \nIndiana returns to action this Wednesday, when they travel to take on Cooper Flagg and the Dallas Mavericks. \n            \n    ",

In addition to leading the Penguins to their fifth win in their last six games, Crosby made NHL history by becoming the ninth player to register 1,700 career points and is the fourth-fastest player to reach that number. Only Wayne Gretzky, fellow Penguins icon Mario Lemieux and Marcel Dionne tallied 1,700 points in fewer games than Crosby, who reached that milestone in his 1,362nd game. Crosby surpassed another Penguins great Jaromir Jagr, who recorded his 1,700th career point in his 1,408th game. Crosby, who is also only the fourth player to score 1,700 points with one team, tallied three points during Monday's 6-3 win over the St. Louis Blues. He had two assists before getting scoring his seventh goal of the season early in the third period. \nThe 38-year-old also made franchise history by surpassing Lemieux for the most multi-point games in franchise history. Monday was the 498th multi-point game of Crosby's decorated career. \nCrosby isn't the only Penguins veteran who is enjoying a strong start to the 2025-26 season. Evgeni Malkin, who recently made history with Crosby and defenseman Kris Letang by becoming the longest-tenured teammates in American sports history, currently leads the NHL with 13 assists and is tied for the league lead with 16 points. The 39-year-old Malkin had a goal and an assist on Monday as the Penguins improved to 7-2-1. \nMalkin and Crosby have been two reasons for the Penguins' surprising success this season. Led by first year head coach Dan Muse, Pittsburgh is off to its best 10-game start since the 2014-15 season. The Penguins are ultimately hoping to make the playoffs for the first time since the 2021-22 campaign. \n            \n    ",

Meanwhile, Washington (2-4) lost both its Week 7 game to the Cowboys, 44-22, and its quarterback in Jayden Daniels (hamstring) to injury. Marcus Mariota will start in his place, though the Commanders have receivers Terry McLaurin (hell) and Deebo Samuel (quad) back this week. Washington defensive lineman Daron Payne (toe) is questionable, while kicker Matt Gay (back) has been ruled out. Offensive tackle (personal) Josh Simmons is out for Kansas City, while offensive guard Trey Smith (back) is doubtful.Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.

The Commanders have won each of their last three road MNF matchups, and they've also gone 5-1-1 against the spread (ATS) in non-conference games since the start of last season. That's the third best spread record over that stretch, while Kansas City has failed to live up to the line in recent Monday games.

With their read-option attack, the Commanders always come up clutch around the goal line as they rank second in redzone scoring.

    "body": "\n        The Kansas City Chiefs just keep rolling, improving to 6-2 after Monday night's convincing 28-7 win over the Washington Commanders. What was dubbed an important game on the \"Monday Night Football\" slate at the beginning of the season had little pizazz, due to the Commanders having a sub-.500 record and Jayden Daniels being out for this game.Kansas City outscored Washington 21-0 in the second half, as the Commanders struggled to keep pace with Marcus Mariota filling in for Daniels. The Chiefs scored on their first three second-half possessions and never looked back, as Patrick Mahomes threw three touchdown passes in the final 30 minutes.A game that was close at halftime turned into another blowout in Week 8, which tied for the most 18-plus point wins in a single week in NFL history (nine). This week also featured the fewest games decided by single digits since Week 14 in 1970 (one).This \"Monday Night Football\" matchup was uneventful but still enough to spark overreactions. Which ones have merit, and which are truly overreactions?\nChiefs' next three games will determine home-field advantage in the AFCOverreaction or reality: Reality The Chiefs are 5-1 since their 0-2 start, improving to 5-3 on the season and staying alive in the AFC West race. Kansas City is one of seven teams currently in the playoff picture, but there's still a long season ahead. The Chiefs are among the best teams in the conference -- but can they truly compete for the top seed in the AFC?Here are the Chiefs' next three games: at Bills, at Broncos (after the bye) and vs. Colts. These three matchups will go a long way in determining whether Kansas City can earn home-field advantage in the AFC and capture the division. The Buffalo game is massive on its own, but it could also decide whether the Chiefs go to Buffalo or the Bills come to Kansas City in January.This will also be Kansas City's first game against Denver this year, so a win would allow the Chiefs to leap the Broncos in the playoff standings.\nFinally, the showdown against the Colts is a litmus test for both teams. The winner of that game -- assuming the Chiefs go 2-0 in their next two -- could ultimately determine who lands the No. 1 seed in the AFC. If the Chiefs go 3-0, there's a strong chance they'll secure the top seed. Even a 2-1 stretch would keep them firmly in the mix.These next few games are massive for Kansas City's season.Commanders fooled themselves into thinking they were Super Bowl contendersOverreaction or reality: Reality The Commanders were the surprise of the 2024 season, going from 4-13 to 12-5 and reaching the NFC Championship Game. Last year was the best season Washington had since 1991, and the franchise was fooled by that shocking turnaround.Jayden Daniels was one of the best quarterbacks in football during his rookie season. This year, he's missed three games and hasn't been the same game-changing player when he's been on the field. Washington also has the oldest roster in the NFL, and injuries have hit several of its core players. The Commanders don't have an elite player outside of Daniels, and it shows week to week.\nWashington was also fooled by its six wins when tied or trailing with 10 seconds left — the most by any team in NFL history. The Commanders were fortunate to pull out those games and avoid major injuries, luck that hasn't carried over this season. The 3-5 record shouldn't be surprising, especially with Daniels missing as much time as he has.This is an old football team -- one that needs to get younger and fix its issues on the defensive side of the ball. Most of the acquisitions Washington made this offseason were aging veterans, and that can't continue if the Commanders want to make a Super Bowl run in 2026.Chiefs need to add a running back at the trade deadlineOverreaction or reality: OverreactionThe Chiefs are in the midst of another Super Bowl run and already have an excellent passing game with Rashee Rice back and their left tackle issues from last season fixed. The missing component on offense appears to be at running back, where Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt have held down the fort.\nHere's the catch: the Chiefs have been running the ball well. Kansas City rushed 30 times for 148 yards on Monday night, averaging 4.9 yards per carry. Over the last four games, the Chiefs rank third in rushing yards (570), third in rushing touchdowns (six) and 11th in yards per carry (4.7). Kansas City is running the ball efficiently -- fifth in the NFL in yards before contact per rush (2.05), a testament to the offensive line.Do the Chiefs have a dynamic running back who can change a game? Absolutely not. But they have a solid committee led by Pacheco and Hunt. The Chiefs could improve in yards after contact, but they're getting enough from what they have.Kansas City doesn't need to add a running back, though it likely will to make the offense even more explosive. For now, the Chiefs can ride with Pacheco and Hunt.\nChiefs are better through eight games this year than last yearOverreaction or reality: Reality The records are completely different after eight games. Kansas City was 8-0 through its first eight games last season but had just a plus-56 point differential and a minus-4 turnover margin. The Chiefs are only 5-3 through eight games this year but have a plus-83 point differential and a plus-8 turnover margin.Kansas City is better along the offensive line, averaging more yards per play (5.8 to 5.2) as a result. The Chiefs averaged 24.6 points per game through eight games in 2024 and 26.8 through eight games in 2025. They aren't surviving on one-score victories this season; instead, they're demonstrating dominance over opponents.Mahomes has 17 touchdowns to four interceptions (103.1 passer rating) through eight games this year compared with 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions (90.1 rating) last year. The defense ranks fourth in yards allowed per game (277.8) and second in points allowed per game (16.4) through eight games this year, compared with fourth in points allowed (18.4) and fifth in yards allowed (293.6) last season.\nThis Chiefs team is better through eight games than last year's team, even though the 2024 version was unbeaten at this point.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Stop us if you've heard this before: The Browns wasted a Myles Garrett masterpiece Sunday.Cleveland's superstar edge rusher recorded a franchise-record five sacks (as well as one forced fumble), wreaking havoc on Drake Maye and the Patriots all game long. He beat double teams. He made a mockery of one-on-one scenarios. He won from the left side and the right. He chased down Maye, an outstanding athlete, on multiple occasions.It didn't matter much. The Browns lost 32-13 to fall to 2-6, even with Garrett recording just the 20th five-sack game in NFL history. Entering Sunday, players with a five-sack game had a 16-3 record. None of the three players who lost had lost by more than three points. The Browns lost by 19.So even though Garrett's highlights are absurd, the clip that's gained the most attention is this one of him slamming his helmet late in the defeat.\nHe sat by himself at the end of the bench as the clock wound down, and afterwards, he was matter-of-fact about his frustration.\"It doesn't get any easier each week you ask me,\" Garrett said regarding the team's inability to create an offense conducive to winning football games.\"I would throw the whole performance away for a win,\" he said about his own accomplishments.\nThe Browns are 55-84-1 since Garrett arrived as the top pick in 2017, the seventh-worst mark in the NFL over that span, and have made the postseason just twice. The team has churned through 15 starting quarterbacks over that span, though it doesn't appear that No. 16 is on the way after head coach Kevin Stefanski said he'll stick with struggling rookie Dillon Gabriel after the bye.That frustration played a part in Garrett requesting a trade in early February. By the end of the month, reports emerged that he was unwilling to sign a contract extension with the franchise. In early March, reports emerged that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam wouldn't meet with Garrett, who was considering sitting out games.But two days after that report, Garrett signed a four-year, $160 million extension with Cleveland. At $40 million per year, it made Garrett the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time. Later in the offseason, another pass rusher, Micah Parsons, took that throne. Notably, though, that payday came after the Cowboys granted his trade request, shipping him to the Packers in a stunning blockbuster deal.\nSunday's outburst and comments show Garrett's frustration has boiled over again. With the trade deadline nearing, it's only natural to wonder if Garrett, tied for the NFL lead with 10.0 sacks, could be on the move. A deeper examination, though, shows it won't happen.\n        \n            \n                2025 NFL Trade Deadline Tracker: Live updates and analysis as Rams bolster defense\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nGarrett's frustration with Browns\"As a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl -- and that goal fuels me today more than ever,\" Garrett said in a Feb. 3 statement when he requested his trade from the Browns. \"My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today.\"While I've loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won't allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl.\n\"With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.\"That second-to-last sentence seemed especially pertinent -- and a bit of a shot. Garrett's trade request came roughly a week after general manager Andrew Berry said he had no intentions of trading Garrett and \"we envision him going from Cleveland to Canton when his career is over.\"Canton, of course, is where the Pro Football Hall of Fame resides. Garrett is undoubtedly on that path. He's a six-time All-Pro (four-time first-team selection) and six-time Pro Bowler. He won the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year, between finishing in the award's top five in 2022 and 2024. He's tied for the NFL lead with 10.0 sacks this season and, at 29 years old, has shown no signs of slowing down.As has been the case throughout much of his career, the Browns are struggling. After losing to the Bengals 17-16 in Week 1 -- kicker Andre Szmyt missed an extra point and a short field goal -- Cleveland got blown out by Baltimore 47-10, and Garrett couldn't hide his frustration.\n\"I mean, this shit is embarrassing,\" Garrett said after the Browns allowed 31 second-half points. \"We got to be better on defense. We got to be better as a team. They slowly chipped away and we did a solid job, holding them to three when we could, and then eventually the dam broke and they just did whatever they wanted, and we have to continue to play a 60-minute game.\"Could the Browns actually trade him?The short answer is technically \"yes.\" There is no rule that's stopping them. But let's make this clear: The Browns won't trade Garrett this season.There are several issues at play. First, there's the financial aspect. Trading Garrett would trigger a dead cap hit of nearly $68 million for the 2026 season. For reference, the largest single-season dead money hit in NFL history is Russell Wilson's $53 million, stemming from the Broncos cutting ties with him in 2024.\nThen there's the return.\"That's probably more of an offseason consideration when Cleveland could maximize draft choice compensation,\" said Joel Corry, a former NFL agent and current CBS Sports analyst, via text last month. \"I'm assuming Myles Garrett would be more likely to waive his no trade clause for an expected playoff contender.\"He is making $31.5M in 2026. The trade would have to be within the first 15 days of the 2026 league year because that's when a $29.2 million payment is due to exercise a dummy (voiding) 2031 contract year.\"That is the biggest difference between the Parsons trade and any potential Garrett move. Garrett has already been paid. Parsons hadn't been.\nIt's easy to see why Garrett is frustrated. No one likes losing. No one likes seeing historic performances go to waste. But Garrett knew a season like this was a likely reality when he signed his then-record-breaking deal. He will have to stick out another lost season in Cleveland.\n            ",

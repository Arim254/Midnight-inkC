The Tide are coming off their best offensive performance of the season, scoring their most points (34) on the road when they defeated Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff first round, and that was against an Oklahoma defense which ranks No. 8 in the nation in points allowed per game.The Over is 5-2 for Indiana over its last seven, and it's 8-5 overall for the season. The Hoosiers have the No. 4 scoring offense in the country as Mendoza is forecasted to account for two total touchdowns, while IU's ground game piles up nearly 150 yards. Bama's Ty Simpson is expected to keep pace, with him actually throwing for more yards than the Heisman winner. With two prolific offenses, 50 combined points are projected as the Over hits in over 50% of simulations.The model also says one side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time. You can see the model's pick at SportsLine.  So who wins Alabama vs. Indiana, and which side of the spread hits well over 60% of the time? Visit SportsLine now to see which side of the Indiana vs. Alabama spread to jump on, all from the advanced model that's simulated this game 10,000 times, and find out.\n            ",

Next, we found out why Indiana was the unquestioned No. 1 team entering this tournament as Curt Cignetti's Hoosiers demolished Alabama. Finally, in one of the best games of the year, Ole Miss rallied to stun Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. Now, we move on to the semifinals where Miami will clash with Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl, while Indiana and Oregon will take part in a rematch from their game earlier this season in the Peach Bowl. Below you can stay updated with the College Football Playoff schedule as we move onto the semifinal round. 2025-26 College Football Playoff scheduleAll times EasternSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss vs. (10) Miami: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9Peach Bowl -- (1) Indiana vs. (5) Oregon: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. First roundFriday, Dec. 19\n(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3: | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsCotton Bowl -- (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasOrange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New Orleans\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

The Hurricanes rushed out to a 14-0 lead, then withstood a second-half rally to pick up a 24-14 win and earn a spot in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal. There the 'Canes will face off against No. 6 Ole Miss. The Rebels stunned No. 3 Georgia on a late walk-off field goal to pull off a 39-34 win in one of the best games in CFP history. Styles make fights and Maimi-Ole Miss certainly stacks up as a clash of different approaches. On one side, the Hurricanes are built to win at the line of scrimmage with a dominant offensive and defensive line. While the Rebels aren't goncg to concede the trenches, they clearly revolve around dynamic quarterback Trinidad Chambliss, who willed them to a win over Georgia in the quarterfinals.On the other side of the bracket, No. 5 Oregon flexed its muscles in a 23-0 victory over  No. 4 Texas Tech. The much-hyped Red Raiders defense held its own, but it was the Ducks who stole the show on that side of the ball, recording a shutout and picking up a convincing win. But the quarterfinals' most convincing victory belonged to No. 1 Indiana. The Hoosiers dismantled No. 9 Alabama 38-3, leaving no doubt on their way to a semifinal rematch with the Ducks in the Peach Bowl. These two teams met on Oct. 11, with the Hoosiers taking home a 30-20 victory that announced Indiana as a true national title contender in 2025. Below, you'll find all the viewing information for every game all the way through to the CFP National Championship. \n\n                                                                    CBS Sports graphic\n                                                            2025-26 College Football Playoff bracketAll times EasternFirst roundFriday, Dec. 19(9) Alabama 34, (8) Oklahoma 24 | RecapGaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium -- Norman, Oklahoma Saturday, Dec. 20(10) Miami 10, (7) Texas A&M 3 | RecapKyle Field -- College Station, Texas(6) Ole Miss 41, (11) Tulane 10 | RecapVaught-Hemingway Stadium -- Oxford, Mississippi (5) Oregon 51, (12) James Madison 34 | RecapAutzen Stadium -- Eugene, Oregon QuarterfinalsWednesday, Dec. 31Cotton Bowl (10) Miami 24, (2) Ohio State 14 | RecapAT&T Stadium -- Arlington, TexasThursday, Jan. 1Orange Bowl -- (5) Oregon 23, (4) Texas Tech 0 | RecapHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. Rose Bowl -- (1) Indiana 38, (9) Alabama 3 | RecapRose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.Sugar Bowl -- (6) Ole Miss 39, (3) Georgia 34 | RecapCaesars Superdome -- New OrleansSemifinalsThursday, Jan. 8Fiesta Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNState Farm Stadium -- Glendale, Ariz. Friday, Jan. 9\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. | ESPNMercedes-Benz Stadium -- AtlantaCollege Football Playoff National ChampionshipMonday, Jan. 207:30 p.m. | ESPNHard Rock Stadium -- Miami Gardens, Fla. \n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        For the second time in three weeks, Joe Burrow publicly voiced his opinion on a need for the Cincinnati Bengals to fix recent struggles. Ahead of Sunday's Week 18 start in the finale against the Cleveland Browns, Burrow called for change.Cincinnati will miss the playoffs for the third straight season after getting to the AFC Championship Game in 2022 and a Super Bowl appearance the previous year.\"We don't want to be in the spot we are in now, so something's got to change,\" Burrow said. \"Whether it's players we have continuing to improve and get better and play championship-caliber football or bringing in guys that will or whatever it may be. Obviously, something has to [change].\"Burrow missed nine games with a turf toe injury, but a win over the Browns would be the Bengals' third straight to end the season. He won three of his last five starts since returning from the injury.\"This year, I've played however many games and we've won more than we've lost,\" Burrow said. \"And I feel good about that. All I can do is go out and when I'm out on the field, try to play well, try to win and go from there.\"\nAfter overcoming a torn ACL as a rookie, Burrow battled through various ailments since that AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Bengals are 24-26 overall since and he missed 16 of those contests for health reasons.Cincinnati opened the season with consecutive wins before Burrow injured his toe. Regardless of Sunday's result, the Bengals will finish with their worst record since Burrow's rookie season.Burrow was more upbeat during Wednesday's availability after previously questioning the \"fun\" aspect of playing this season.\n\"I think I have fun playing football,\" Burrow said. \"It's certainly difficult when you can't. And, you know, I had fun last year, too. Certainly frustrating at times. That's life in the NFL. That's life of playing sports. That's why you play it. At the beginning, you feel emotions that you don't feel in other parts of your life. Highs, lows, all the above, everything in between.\"\n            ",

Lake, a team captain, signed a three-year extension Thursday, the Rams announced.The deal is worth $42 million, with $25.7 million guaranteed, according to ESPN. At $14 million annually, it is the 12th-largest per-year contract among all safeties. Lake, a sixth-round pick out of UCLA in 2022, is in the final year of his rookie deal and was set to hit free agency in the offseason. Instead, he'll stay put as another impressive draft-and-develop find for the Rams. \n        \n            \n                Prisco's Week 18 NFL picks: Steelers send Ravens to Cancun while 49ers claim No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Pete Prisco                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLake saw spot duty as a rookie and slightly more playing time in his second year, but he broke out in 2024, recording 111 tackles and a pair of sacks while showing off versatility playing all over the secondary. Lake, 26, was on his way to another strong season -- he had his first career interception and also a career-high 10 passes defensed -- before injuring his elbow in Week 11 against the Seattle Seahawks. Rams coach Sean McVay said this week that the Rams will open Lake's 21-day practice window and that the team expects to have him back for the first round of the playoffs. Though he's listed as a safety, Lake has played two-thirds of his snaps this season as a slot cornerback. He is Pro Football Focus' 12th-highest graded safety this season, and the Rams have allowed 5.0 yards per play with him on the field compared to 5.4 yards per play with him off the field.\nThe Rams dropped to 11-5 with a loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Monday night and will close out the season at home against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. The Rams currently occupy the NFC's No. 6 seed, but would jump to the No. 5 spot with a win over the Cardinals and if the Seattle Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday.\n            \n    ",

Top-ranked and unbeaten Indiana's showdown with Alabama in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals appears set to be a wet one.Heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected throughout the morning in Pasadena, California followed by fewer showers in the afternoon during the game, according to AccuWeather.

I don't expect that tomorrow, and I don't expect it to be a real critical factor in the game, and I don't see it changing our game plan very much,\" Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said at his final press conference ahead of the contest.For Alabama, the game plan will not change unless there are heavier rains.\"I think you just gotta see what it is in the moment,\" Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said. \"You know, it could be heavy at times. I don't know. It could be light. You just have to adjust. For us, we haven't played a lot in those elements this season. You try to prepare in practice with a wet ball and things like that, whether it's snapping the football, catching the football, throwing it, whatever it is. \n\"But in the end, you've just got to adapt, and we talked about those things on the staff, whether it's offense or defense, it kind of affects how you go about.\"\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        NFL Week 18 could be considerably lucrative for players with incentive-based contracts, including Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold, Aaron Rodgers of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers standout Keenan Allen.Darnold could hit a $1 million jackpot with three touchdown passes and 150 yards passing against the San Francisco 49ers in a battle for the NFC West. Darnold has 3,850 yards through the air and 25 touchdowns with notable escalators in his contract.Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle is active for the finale against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which means he cashes a $1 million bonus. He could tack on another $250,000 to that with a touchdown. For the Buccaneers, wideout Sterling Shepard needs one reception for $125,000 and just 29 receiving yards for an additional $125,000.Rodgers' one-year deal with the Steelers is laced with incentives to a total of $5.85 million if he hits them all. Only one of those — make the playoffs — can be accomplished this weekend with a win.\nRodgers makes $500,000 if the Steelers beat the Baltimore Ravens to win the AFC North. Among other incentives, Rodgers take homes $600,000 if the Steelers win a wild-card game and he plays at least 50% of the offensive snaps and another $1 million should Pittsburgh win the AFC Championship.NFL's Week 18 incentive notablesPotential total earningsNeedHow it happensKeenan Allen, Chargers$1.25 million6 catches; 9+ yards; 2 TDsImpressive statsRico Dowdle, Panthers$1.25 millionActive; TDPlay and scoreSam Darnold, Seahawks$1 million3 passing TD; 150 yardsUsual effortAaron Rodgers, Steelers$500,000WinBeat Baltimore Tony Pollard, Titans$500,00066 rushing yards; 2 TDsBest season avg.Dawson Knox, Bills$500,0007+ yards; TDFind red zone TDSaquon Barkley, Eagles$500,00087 scrimmage yardsHeavy touchesCaleb Williams, BearsFuture max270 yards for 4,000Explosive playsFor Allen, there's a $1.25 million bonus on the line against the Denver Broncos. Six catches would give him a $750,000 check, while nine or more yards receiving and two touchdowns would net him another $500,000. Allen has 74 receptions for 741 yards and four scores this fall.For 49ers wideout Jauan Jennings, a seven-reception game would give him a $666,666 bonus. Washington Commanders playmaker Deebo Samuel could get to $1.5 million with at least 10 catches, 93 yards receiving and two touchdowns to hit everything.Commanders pass rusher Von Miller needs one sack of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts to hit a $1 million bonus.New England Patriots tight end Hunter Henry could pocket a $250,000 incentive with five catches against the Miami Dolphins. And Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, the MVP frontrunner, is expected to play.While there's no contract language in the form of a bonus for Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams, the former No. 1 overall pick looks to become the franchise's first 4,000-yard passer. That would push the second-year pro closer to a max deal when the times comes. Williams needs 109 yards against the Detroit Lions to break Erik Kramer's team record of 3,838 set in 1995 and 270 yards to eclipse 4,000.\"For me, it would be cool just in the sense there's never been one here,\" Williams said. \"I was brought here for those types of things and those types of moments, the things that haven't been done here, to try and be able to accomplish. But the self-goals and all of that always get swept under when you go for team goals and that's winning ballgames. That's first and foremost on my mind. That's first and foremost for this team because the most important thing is winning ballgames and heading into the playoffs with some momentum and some good energy.\"And in another milestone department, 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is 110 receiving yards away from hitting the 1,000-yard mark in both rushing and receiving this season, which would mark the second time that's happened in his NFL career.Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett needs one sack to set NFL record and he gets his opportunity against one of the NFL's weakest offensive fronts.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As the new year inches closer, it's time to close the chapter on one footballing journey and embrace another. As professional leagues and global competitions prepare for a long winter's nap, it's also the time of year to get reflective, which means this is the perfect moment to do a Ballon d'Or Power Rankings. The 2025-26 UEFA Champions League looks ahead to the knockout rounds in February after celebrating a new era with the league phase. A new generation of stars has risen alongside established icons to define this historic season. An 18-team, six-round, gauntlet introduced new faces alongside established icons of the game to build a new era of Champions League. In typical soccer culture, it's the battlegrounds where cases are made for individual accolades. For extra clarity and context, sorry, there's no Aitana Bonmati on this (current) list. To be fair, the midfield paragon began her campaign with a bit of a chip on her shoulder, with elevated, commanding play. After sustaining a fractured left fibula that will keep her out till perhaps April, we just couldn't place her in these current rankings. But knowing how things have panned out in the past, she could go on a three-month run and still be in contention for the award, let alone an analyst's ranking.\nThere is also no Patri Guijarro, another Barcelona midfielder, who has often flown under the shadows of Bonmati and Alexia Putellas. A foot injury hampered her participation the the UWCL league phase, but she could be back in January, leaving plenty of time to work her way back into form and conversation around the grand individual prize. Still, there were plenty of standout performances on full display, so who are the players that are etching their names in the conversation as the world's best? The truth is that there's a plethora of athletes to choose from, so many that even the Champions League can't contain them all. If next season's Ballon d'Or is already in contention (August to July), then this is more a mid-year check-in than any sort of end-of-year summary. In fact, if based purely on performances across both domestic leagues and other big stages, here's a power ranking of the 10 players currently making a case for Ballon d'Or.\n10. Khadija Shaw (Man City)A ruthless striker, Khadija \"Bunny\" Shaw remains one of the most consistent and dominant forwards in the game. While Manchester City are not in the Champions League, her impressive form cannot be ignored. Scoring 12 goals in 11 WSL matches, she's leaving the rest of the league in the dust in the Golden Boot race. It's not just that she's a nightmare for any defender, but her ability to win aerial duels and maneuver out of any tight spaces makes her a prolific player.9. Hannah Hampton (Chelsea)Perhaps a bit hypocritical to place a currently injured player among the rankings, but Chelsea FC goalkeeper Hanna Hampton is undoubtedly reliable as the Blues' last line of defense. Her quad injury flared up in November, and holiday time away could see Hampton right back in the net for Chelsea in January.Whether in WSL or Champions League, she's been a rock, offering a calm, commanding presence that allows her star-studded team to play with freedom. She's maintaining a clean sheet while boasting an 85.2% save percentage in domestic play, saving more goals than expected. \n8. Linda Caicedo (Real Madrid)It seems as if Linda Caicedo is just scratching the surface of what's to come for her. At just 19 years old, she's delivered on the hype around her as one of Colombia's finest and Real Madrid's most thrilling players. She's producing for the club both domestically and in the Champions League by playing fearlessly and consistently taking on defenders or creating chaos. \n7. Sandy Baltimore (Chelsea FC)France international Sandy Baltimore is the open secret weapon for Chelsea. She can both create and finish chances with a versatility that can take her from the back to the front line in an instant. She can pop up in dangerous spaces and with a cool composure that makes her invaluable. As a creator, she's able to chip in for others while testing goalkeepers on her own. Her two goals in six Champions League games this season are just added assets. 6. Temwa Chawinga (Kansas City Current)If there's going to be a player on a Ballon d'Or power ranking that represents NWSL, it will be the league MVP and Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga. The Malawian International earned the two honors in back-to-back seasons, and prior to a late-season adductor injury, she was the most lethal striker on the planet. Her missing presence on other lists is outright ignorant, but that's not going to happen here. If Chawinga is back to producing come Spring 2026, expect her to be higher on this list. \n5. Caroline Graham Hansen (FC Barcelona)In years past, Caroline Graham Hansen has been a direct rival to her own club teammates when it comes to Ballon d'Or resumes. She's a relentless force on the right wing for Barcelona, and her instinctual motion constantly puts defenders in panic mode. She leads the team in shots (19) during the league phase, an example of her constant effort to drive at opponents and create chances whenever possible. \n4. Mariona Caldentey (Arsenal)Since her arrival in England, Mariona Caldenty has been the key to tempo control for Arsenal. Her goal contributions in the competition don't quite mirror her previous Champions League winning season, yet, but her influence on the team is in her intelligent movement throughout the center of the pitch. She's been crucial in linking play and can make the Gunners' attacking system click when it seems overly stagnant. 3. Klara Buhl (Bayern Munich)No one is chasing Klara Buhl in assists this Champions League season. She brought Bayern Munich back from a troubled opening round match against Barcelona and essentially erased any bad lingering feelings from a poor matchday 1 with eight assists through six games this campaign\nHer incredible creative output simply cannot be ignored. Her unselfish play in the final third and exceptional crosses are the primary fuel for Bayern's attack.\n2. Alexia Putellas (FC Barcelona)Already a two-time Ballon d'Or winner, Alexia Putellas continues to operate at a lethal level. The Barcelona midfielder maintains the rhythm of her squad and constantly orchestrates play. She's had an impressive Champions League campaign through the league phase. Despite two penalty misses, she's scored three goals and delivered four assists in the opening rounds, and is averaging a direct goal involvement of more than once per game. Her ability to dictate play, thread narrow passes, and technical execution will keep her in the running for individual awards. \n1. Melchie Dumornay (OL Lyonnes)There's perhaps no other player in Europe who is as potent and exciting a threat as Melchie Durmornay. The Haitian international has taken another step forward in her career, showing off her incredible skill set through increasingly versatile play. Whether as a pure number nine, or in a lower role, she has taken charge of OL Lyonnes' current form in the Champions League. She leads the club with 21 shots and four goals in the tournament, and her movement off the ball is constantly opening up lanes for others. Her combination of timed runs and fearless long-range precision with technical flair makes her arguably the most dangerous player to defend at the moment. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18, and they're going to have their quarterback back in the lineup. Lamar Jackson, who has been dealing with a back contusion, will play in the battle for the AFC North crown, he confirmed to reporters Thursday.\nJackson suffered the injury when he got kneed in the back in Week 16 against the New England Patriots and then missed Week 17 against the Green Bay Packers but was a full participant in both Wednesday's and Thursday's practices. He's on track to have his first full week of practice in nearly two months.Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson \"looked good\" at practice on Wednesday. On Thursday, Jackson said he \"feels great.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers decide AFC North in Week 18; Seahawks-49ers play for No. 1 seed in NFC\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nJackson dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year, and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game the Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Packers.\n\"It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,\" Harbaugh said Monday.After Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England. Furthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh.\nBut the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        FRISCO, Texas -- Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus is feeling the heat. His Dallas defense in Year 1 as the team's defensive coordinator under head coach Brian Schottenheimer is allowing 29.8 points per game, the most in the NFL. One of the elephants in the room regarding the Cowboys' defensive decline is the 2025 season was the first without All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, whom Dallas traded away to the Green Bay Packers a week before the season began. Eberflus noted his impact but also accurately assessed Parsons' departure \"is what it is.\" \"Obviously you have an All-Pro pass rusher that wins really quick [Parsons], that's certainly going to help any defense if it's Micah or if it's Myles [Garrett] or whoever that might be. But that impact player is always going to help to a certain degree in pass downs and other downs,\" Eberflus said Thursday. Again, you can't look back right? It is what it is and then you just focus where you are.\"\n        \n            \n                Wilson's 2026 NFL mock draft 4.0: Cowboys beef up the trenches as the Steelers look for help at WR\n                \n                    Ryan Wilson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nParsons himself saw that comment on Twitter/X, and he reposted Eberflus' press conference quote with a number of laughing emojis. He then clarified why he took an apparent shot at Eberflus and the Cowboys an hour after posting the initial reaction. \n\"Y'all want me to feel bad? Jerry Jones slandered my name  to Cowboys media and national media for months,\" Parsons posted on Thursday. \"So I do think I can react to comment if I want to! #respectfully.\"\nDallas' defense was also derailed by injuries across the board at cornerback with DaRon Bland (foot), ex-Cowboy Trevon Diggs (knee/concussion), Shavon Revel (knee) and Caelen Carson (knee, hamstring). Diggs and Eberflus also clashed about zone vs. man coverage usage all year long. \"I think the start of the year, guys were in and out, in terms of we weren't at full force,\" Eberflus said. \"And then when we got some guys back, I thought we had a good stretch there. I thought the stretch was pretty good. We started to improve. I know we improved in the run defense and the third-down defense. And then from there we just didn't execute the way we wanted to at certain moments. Certainly, some good execution in there at times, but it's got to be better.\"  \nDespite the Cowboys' defense ranking bottom-three in the NFL in almost every key defensive metric this season, Eberflus claimed he didn't think he would \"do anything differently\" when CBS Sports asked what things he would do differently if he could go back to the beginning of the year. \"I don't really think about it that way,\" Eberflus said Thursday. \"I think about being in the moment and just keep adjusting and learning and growing and getting better. I don't think I'd do anything differently. I think I would just work to adjust when you get different players in and those things. I think that's what you do as a coach.\"  Cowboys defense under Matt Eberflus in 2025, NFL ranksNFL rankPPG allowed29.8LastTotal YPG allowed376.830thYards per play allowed6.231stPassing yards per game allowed253.6LastThird down conversion rate allowed 46.5%30thRed zone TD rate allowed 68.9%31stCompletion percentage allowed68.6%30thPass yards per attempt allowed8.231stPasser Rating109.7LastHowever, Eberflus ultimately fell on the sword and took full accountability for the year-long struggles Dallas has had on defense. \"Ownership and accountability is right with me,\" Eberflus said when asked how much ownership he takes for the defensive struggles. \"I'm the defensive coordinator, so it's always that. … I take full accountability.\"  We wanted to see more progress during the course of the year,\" Eberflus said. \"It was just more up and down. It just wasn't linear.\"Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones may choose to have Eberflus' ownership of his defensive woes result in a firing after just one season. Jones admitted regret for hiring him in Week 16 after Dallas was officially eliminated from playoff contention.\"Ultimately, you point your finger right back at you on who hired Matt Eberflus,\" Jones said. \"It's easy to say you could have done things differently, but that goes with the territory. Any time you make the ultimate decision, then you've got to look at that and weigh it.\"  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Historically, it's hard to find a more stark contrast in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals than you'll see in the Rose Bowl quarterfinal. No. 9 Alabama has a strong argument as the most successful college football program of all time, ranking high in all-time wins, national titles, Heisman winners, bowl wins and conference titles. On the other side, you have Indiana, outside the top 100 in all-time wins and fresh off its first outright conference title since 1945. Alabama is coming off a dramatic first-round CFP win against Oklahoma. The Crimson Tide trailed by 17 points in the first half before rallying for a 34-24 victory, becoming the first team to win a road game in the 12-team CFP format.Indiana is making its second consecutive CFP appearance and will play in the quarterfinals for the first time in program history. The Hoosiers lost to Notre Dame in the first round last season but went 13-0 this year and defeated Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game to earn the Rose Bowl berth.With inclement weather conditions expected at the 2026 Rose Bowl, a rarity for this legendary game, anything is on the table. \nFollow along with live updates and analysis as Indiana faces Alabama in the 2026 Rose Bowl Game. Where to watch Alabama vs. Indiana liveDate: Thursday, Jan. 1 | Time: 4 p.m. ETLocation: Rose Bowl -- Pasadena, Calif.TV: ABC | Live stream: fubo (Try for free)Alabama vs. Indiana: Players to watch in Rose BowlTy Simpson, QB, Alabama: Simpson is coming off one of his strongest performances in weeks after leading Alabama to a dramatic win over Oklahoma. He completed 19 of 29 passes for 232 yards and two touchdowns as the Crimson Tide erased a 17-point first-half deficit. Simpson enters the Rose Bowl having thrown for 3,500 yards and 28 touchdowns against five interceptions. For Alabama to pull the upset, the offense will need him at his best.\nRyan Williams, WR, Alabama: Williams has been one of the more puzzling players in college football this season. After a standout freshman campaign, his production has been inconsistent. He has recorded two receptions or fewer in each of his past four games, including a one-catch, five-yard outing against Oklahoma. The Rose Bowl would be an ideal stage for Williams to rediscover his big-play form.Bray Hubbard, DB, Alabama: Hubbard has been one of Alabama's most reliable defenders this season. He finished with five tackles against Oklahoma in the CFP first round. On the year, Hubbard has totaled 66 tackles (40 solo), three forced fumbles and four interceptions. Alabama's defense will be under the spotlight against Indiana's potent offense.Fernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana: Mendoza transferred from Cal this offseason and immediately elevated Indiana's offense. In 13 games, he completed 71.5% of his passes for 2,980 yards, 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Known for his accuracy, Mendoza threw for 222 yards and a touchdown against Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game, a performance that effectively sealed the Heisman Trophy.\nOmar Cooper Jr., WR, Indiana: Indiana features multiple receivers capable of stretching the field, and Cooper has been the most productive. He leads the team with 58 receptions and 804 receiving yards and finished second with 11 touchdown catches, trailing only Elijah Sarratt.Rolijah Hardy, LB, Indiana: Indiana ranked second nationally in total yards allowed and points per game, and Hardy has been a central figure in that success. He leads the Hoosiers with 87 tackles and eight sacks and has added four pass breakups this season.Alabama vs. Oklahoma prediction, pick\nLast year, the Rose Bowl produced one of the biggest shockers of the entire football season. No. 1 seed Oregon was stunned by Ohio State after finishing the regular season with a perfect record. Not saying that will happen, but I expect this game to be competitive. Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer has proven he can lead his respective teams to wins over ranked opponents. Indiana wins, but this will be a one-score game throughout. Pick: Alabama +6.5 (-102) \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of the final non-College Football Playoff bowl games of the 2025 season will take place on Friday night in Charlotte when Mississippi State faces Wake Forest in the Duke's Mayo Bowl. Jan. 2 will feature four bowl games (Mayo, Armed Forces, Liberty and Holiday) to close out bowl season. Despite going 5-7 in the regular season, Mississippi State received a bowl game invite due to its high Academic Progress Rate (APR). With other teams opting out of bowl games, it paved the way for the Bulldogs to play an additional game, despite not clearing the six-win mark typically needed to become bowl-eligible. The Bulldogs lost their final three SEC games, with the lone win against a conference opponent coming against Arkansas earlier in the year. Wake Forest went 8-4 in Year 1 of the Jake Dickert era. The Demon Deacons went 6-2 down the stretch after starting 2-2 with losses to Georgia Tech and NC State. With a win, Wake Forest can reach the nine-win mark for the first time since 2021. \n Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest: Need to know for Duke's Mayo Bowl Year 2 of the Jeff Lebby era could end in style: In Year 1 of his tenure at Mississippi State, Lebby led his team to a 2-10 record. The Bulldogs opened the 2024 campaign with a win over Eastern Kentucky but lost 10 of their final 11 games to finish with just two wins. Mississippi State also went winless (0-8) against SEC opponents. This season was a clear sign of growth despite the record. Mississippi State recorded a dramatic win over Arizona State earlier in the year and beat Arkansas for Lebby's first SEC win at the school. A win over Wake Forest can bring positive momentum into 2026. Dickert has Wake Forest back on track: After recording back-to-back seasons with four wins, Wake Forest got back on track this season by doubling its win total. After former coach Dave Clawson resigned at the conclusion of last season, the program hired Dickert away from his post at Washington State. The results from Year 1 of his tenure have been overwhelmingly positive. The program is on the verge of finishing with nine wins for just the third time since 2007. Another look at Mississippi State's Kamario Taylor: Taylor, a four-star prospect from the 2025 recruiting cycle, made his first career start in the Egg Bowl against Ole Miss. Taylor finished that game 15-of-31 for 178 yards and ran 20 times for 173 yards and two touchdowns. The bowl game will be another huge opportunity for him to show why he could be the future answer at quarterback for Lebby's team. \n Where to watch Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest live Date: Friday, Jan. 2 | Time: 8 p.m. ET Location: Bank of America Stadium -- Charlotte, North Carolina TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)  Mississippi State vs. Wake Forest prediction, picks\nMississippi State might've found its long-term answer at quarterback in Taylor. This bowl game will be another opportunity for him to showcase his dynamic ability as a dual-threat. Although Wake Forest is on the verge of reaching the nine-win mark for the third time since 2007, I expect Mississippi State to get it done. The Bulldogs win by a touchdown to close out the bowl season. Pick: Mississippi State -3.5\n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Tom Fornelli\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chip Patterson\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Brandon Marcello\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    John Talty\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Richard Johnson\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Shehan Jeyarajah\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    David Cobb\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Brad Crawford\n                            \n            \n                    \n    \n                                            \n                    \n                                    Chris Hummer\n                            \n            MSU -3\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    \n        \n                            Miss.

Six months separate the United States men's national team from now and kicking off the World Cup on home soil, but Mauricio Pochettino has restored belief that this is a team that could make noise. They ended 2025 unbeaten in their last five matches, and Pochettino's plan and the depth of the side are shining in key areas.Excelling against Paraguay and Uruguay to end the year, the challenges will only get harder for the USMNT with Belgium and Portugal on the docket in March, but that's a good thing as players will be able to show what they can do against teams who will be in the mix to win the World Cup. That does mean that it's time for another World Cup roster prediction, as the end of the year has brought changes at the fringes of the side.Playing time concerns are still an issue in the squad with members such as Yunus Musah and Gio Reyna not playing consistently for their clubs, but with the tactical vision for the USMNT becoming clearer, let's take a look at predicting the roster as we're now six months out from the World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\nUSMNT roster locksA section that has been dwindling as regression has hit the USMNT pool, this is a group of players who, if healthy, are still expected to be in the squad and likely start matches. \nGK Matt FreeseDEF Tim ReamDEF Chris RichardsDEF Antonee RobinsonDEF Sergino Dest MID Weston McKennieMID Tyler AdamsFWD Christian PulisicFWD Folarin BalogunOne group of players that hasn't changed is the locks of the squad. If these players are healthy, not only will they be in the World Cup squad, but they'll also be starting the first match for the USMNT, facing Paraguay on June 12 to kick off the tournament. It's a critical moment for the side, but if they're successful at the World Cup, this is the group who will need to be in top form to make it happen. It's not ideal that Tyler Adams is injured to begin the year, but he could be healthy by the March international break when the USMNT will face Portugal and Belgium as World Cup preparation kicks into high gear, but there is a very real possibility that the Bournemouth midfielder isn't at peak fitness when the World Cup kicks off which would be quite a blow to the national team. If someone were to fall out of this group, it'd possibly be Weston McKennie, who missed the September and October international breaks, but with him being back in the midfield rotation for Juventus, there's no reason why a performing McKennie won't be in the World Cup squad. Behind them, things are wide open, considering the lack of depth in defense. Malik Tillman is also probably a lock, but as another player who has had to come in and out of the USMNT squad due to injury, I hesitate to fully put him with this group of players.\nKeeper is also set unless something drastic happens, with no keeper earning a start under Pochettino, except Matt Freese during 2025. Despite Matt Turner getting consistent playing time since returning to the New England Revolution, it hasn't resulted in caps for the USMNT, so that only increases the chances that Freese is the number one when the World Cup gets underway.Players on the bubbleCristian Roldan (Midfielder): The Seattle Sounders man has not only showcased his leadership credentials with the USMNT, but he's also been an integral part of transitioning defense into attack when McKennie isn't in the squad. Now that he's gotten so much playing time under Pochettino while also representing the United States at the 2022 World Cup, it's hard to see a situation where Roldan doesn't make this squad.Roman Celentano (Goalkeeper): A strong performer for FC Cincinnati, Celentano is someone who has been called in under Pochettino, but due to Freese's form, it has kept him from doing much at the national team level.Miles Robinson (Defender): Holding down the Cincinnati defense in front of Celentano, Miles Robinson is someone who Pochettino values in defense. He may not start many games, but Robinson has been among the first names that Pochettino looks to to close out matches, which is a valuable skill.Malik Tillman (Midfielder): Even with the coaching change at Bayer Leverkusen, Tillman has stuck in the lineup while also shining with the USMNT when called into the squad. Injuries kept Tillman out for some of 2025, but moving into 2026, he's someone looking to claim a starting role at the World Cup.Auston Trusty (Defender): Another member of the team with a new coach heading into the new year, as Wilfred Nancy has taken over at Celtic, Trusty is looking to capitalize on the USMNT defense shifting to a back three. One of the defenders who has experience playing in that system, a steady time at Celtic could easily see him make the squad.Gio Reyna (Forward): When Gio Reyna scored for the USMNT against Paraguay, it felt like he made the World Cup squad. While he has yet to nail down a consistent starting role at Borussia Monchengladbach, he's still one of the most talented players in this squad, and Reyna being on the pitch makes things easier for the rest of the USMNT attackers. As long as he's playing regularly in Germany, Reyna will be in the squad.Tanner Tessemann (Midfielder): Thriving after his move to Lyon, Tessemann is someone who can fill multiple roles for the USMNT. He's gotten playing time as a defensive midfielder and as a centerback, versatility that could be key with the national team mixing things up tactically.Ricardo Pepi (Forward): Expected to start more matches for PSV than he has, Ricardo Pepi has made the most of his situation, scoring 10 goals in all competitions so far this season. Now linked to a move to Fulham, there's a chance that Pepi could be joining another American in Antonee Robinson. But, even if that doesn't happen, Pepi is in a situation where he can earn significant playing time and push to cement a role as one of the first players off the bench for the USMNT.Alex Freeman (Defender): Growing by the match under Pochettino, Freeman came from out of the blue, but he's knocking on the door of the World Cup. Showing his two-way skill as a wing back, Freeman is helping push Pochettino to take four fullbacks to the World Cup. Freeman hasn't met a challenge that he hasn't risen to, and he doesn't show signs of slowing down anytime soon.Haji Wright (Forward): With Coventry City flying atop the Championship, Wright is back to getting called into the national team setup on a regular basis. Able to play on the wing or as a traditional nine, Wright's versatility will be important for the USMNT going forward. Max Arfsten (Defender): Able to play as a defender or essentially push up the pitch as a wide midfielder, Arfsten is another player who brings important versatility to the squad. Robinson may be the starter at left back, but it doesn't get much better as far as a change of pace option go.Brenden Aaronson (Midfielder): The top assister for Leeds United this season, it seemed like Aaronson didn't have much of a shot at making the World Cup squad, but his work rate and vision have kept him around the fringes. Only time will tell if that's enough, but Aaronson is doing enough to ensure that he's in the mix right now.Patrick Schulte (Goalkeeper): Probably the best current keeper in the pool with the ball at his feet. If Schulte doesn't get injured ahead of the Gold Cup, Freese may never get his shot to start for the USMNT. With a strong season, Schulte could be the starter in net, but he's falling behind in the rankings.Mark McKenzie (Defender): A player who Pochettino has talked about the art of defending with, McKenzie is someone who could be a surprise starter at the World Cup. He has settled in well since making the move to Toulouse in France, and as another player who is comfortable in a back three or a back four, this could be McKenzie's time.Diego Luna (Midfielder): Becoming Pochettino's right-hand man, Luna now has to prove that he can perform against top opposition. Scoring against Uruguay is a start, but the tougher challenges are yet to come as his performances against Belgium and Portugal will go a long way to determining Luna's World Cup fate.Tim Weah (Forward): Back in France with Marseille, he has been able to play on the wing as well as at wing back, which is a boon for the USMNT. Pochettino has shuffled his position with the national team, but it doesn't feel like there's a scenario where Weah isn't in the squad, although he may not be a starter.Sebastian Berhalter (Midfielder): The Vancouver Whitecaps man has quickly become one of the best players in the squad at delivering set plays. His play on the pitch needs improvement to truly be at a USMNT level at the World Cup, but if someone needs to deliver a free kick or a corner to change the outcome of a game, there are worse options.Patrick Agyemang (Forward): Finding the back of the net for Derby County in the Championship, Agyemang is showing why Pochettino had faith in him. The forwards ahead of him are performing so this is a tenuous spot, but with players like Wright also being able to shift out wide, there's space for another out and out number nine.On the outside looking inHere's a look at those who have missed the cut in this projection:Yunus Musah (Midfielder): Now at Atalanta, Musah has struggled to stick in the starting lineup, and that has also kept him from pushing into Pochettino's plans, but there is still time for a late charge into the side.Jack McGlynn (Midfielder): Injuries have set McGlynn back, so priority one will be getting back to full health, but if he can do that, the Houston midfielder is talented enough to push for a place in the World Cup squad.Noahkai Banks (Defender): Called in by Pochettino but not yet receiving a cap, Banks is someone who the Argentine manager has spoken highly of. In a thin defense, Banks could turn up in the World Cup squad if he continues his strong form for Augsburg.Joe Scally (Defender): The shift to a back three and Scally's versatility will give him a chance, but if he's given opportunities against top teams, his performances for the national team will need to improve after a disappointing November window.Matt Turner (Goalkeeper): It feels like Turner will either be the starter for the USMNT or out of the squad with no in between. Back in New England, he's playing soccer, which is a start, but will there be enough time?Johnny Cardoso (Midfielder): Struggling to make his mark at Atletico Madrid, Cardoso has to be kept in the picture because if he does break into the XI, that would also be enough to earn a role with the USMNT.2026 roster projection Goalkeepers (3): Matt Freese (New York City FC), Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew).Defenders (9): Sergino Dest (PSV), Antonee Robinson (Fulham), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Tim Ream (Fulham), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Auston Trusty (Celtic),Mark McKenzie (Toulouse FC).\nMidfielders (7): Weston McKennie (Juventus), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Malik Tillman (Bayer Leverkusen), Cristian Roldan (Seattle Sounders), Tanner Tessemann (Lyon).Forwards (7): Christian Pulisic (Milan), Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Ricardo Pepi (PSV), Tim Weah (Marseille), Haji Wright (Coventry City), Gio Reyna (Borussia Monchengladbach), Patrick Agyemang (Derby County).\n            \n    \n\n        \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        Alabama's season started and ended with embarrassing losses. There were good moments in between, including a road playoff win over Oklahoma and a regular-season win against Georgia, but its season-opening 31-17 loss to Florida State (a team that finished 5-7) and the blowout 38-3 Rose Bowl loss to No. 1 Indiana are how the 2025 season will be remembered. In each of those losses, Alabama was the physically inferior team. They looked soft when it mattered most. In the Rose Bowl on Thursday afternoon, Indiana looked like those old Alabama teams under Nick Saban -- perfectly comfortable running the ball over and over until it came time for a big throw. Alabama fans know that style of play as \"joyless murderball,\" and it had to be bizarre seeing it deployed so successfully against the inept Crimson Tide this time around. Alabama made the wrong kind of history to begin the 2026 calendar year.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            Under former Saban disciple Curt Cignetti, Indiana resembled the old Alabama.This new Alabama under Kalen DeBoer needs to make some big changes moving forward. This was the kind of devastating, humiliating loss that must invoke introspection. The current blueprint is not going to cut it. Everything from roster construction to staffing to cultural identity should be under review this offseason. Is Ty Simpson the QB next year?Redshirt junior quarterback Ty Simpson will have an important decision to make soon on whether to return for another season or move on to the NFL. In recent CBS Sports mock drafts, experts Mike Renner, Blake Brockermeyer and Ryan Wilson all projected Simpson as a first-round pick. \nWhile only a one-year starter at Alabama after backing up Bryce Young and Jalen Milroe, Simpson is already 23-years-old. If he receives good early feedback, it could be difficult to say no to leaving for the NFL, especially with multiple offensive starters like Germie Bernard and Kadyn Proctor leaving the program. It will be interesting to see how Simpson is perceived, especially after struggling in the Rose Bowl and the SEC Championship. If Simpson is gone, Alabama should be aggressive in adding a viable transfer portal quarterback. There are 10 quarterbacks in the top 50 of 247Sports' portal rankings, including prominent names such as Florida's DJ Lagway, Nebraska's Dylan Raiola, TCU's Josh Hoover and Iowa State's Rocco Becht. If Alabama goes that path, it'll be costly -- $2 million and up for a surefire Power Four starter as CBS Sports recently reported -- but it's likely necessary given the alternatives. \n        \n            \n                What the transfer portal costs now: Position‑by‑position price ranges amid a market surge\n                \n                    Chris Hummer                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAustin Mack looked overwhelmed after coming into the game in place of an injured Simpson. Freshman Keelon Russell is a former five-star and highly regarded, but in what will be a critical year for DeBoer and his Alabama program, it'd be too risky a proposition to not bring in an experienced QB. \nDeBoer and offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb need to discuss the situation with Simpson immediately now that the season is over. And if Simpson is on the way out, Alabama needs to move aggressively and decisively for its new offensive leader. Be more aggressive in the transfer portalRegardless of what happens at the QB position, Alabama needs to be more aggressive this transfer portal cycle. Alabama has prioritized high school players over transfer recruiting, which makes plenty of sense and is the more sustainable long-term strategy. The Tide signed the nation's No. 2 recruiting class in December, headlined by three five-star recruits. But Alabama nearly took a complacent approach to the portal last cycle. They added a few pieces, sure, but I heard from multiple personnel folks around college football who questioned Alabama not being more aggressive in adding impact players. As one Power Four personnel person told me, Alabama would end up being aggressive in the portal during Year 3 out of desperation when it should be proactively doing it in Year 2.\nAnd now, here we are. Even before the portal opens, Alabama is going to have some big holes to fill with the losses of leading receiver Germie Bernard, defensive linemen Tim Keenan and LT Overton, and its two leading tacklers in linebackers Deontae Lawson and Justin Jefferson. Alabama could desperately use upgrades along the offensive line, edge-rusher and running back. There is some potential value to be found at running back, but edge-rusher and offensive line will both be costly -- as Chris Hummer and I reported earlier this week, it'll cost more than $1 million for an elite pass-rusher or offensive tackle.)What choice does Alabama have, though? The run game was a massive liability all season, and it got exposed again against Indiana. Alabama was unwilling to spend up to get a top running back last cycle, opting instead to roll with Jam Miller and the rest of the returning backs after losing Justice Haynes to Michigan. That, obviously, didn't work out and can't be the strategy again going into 2026. Alabama badly needs to get bigger, stronger and tougher in the trenches. Some of those solutions could come from young talent already within the program, but there's no question that additional talent infusion is needed. Now is the time to deploy the financial resources available. \nHow will DeBoer handle the pressure?The timing of the interest from Penn State and Michigan in hiring DeBoer was complicated. If those jobs opened up a year from now, it would have been much clearer as to whether DeBoer was a true success at Alabama or not. He would have had a better sense of whether it was time to jump to a new situation or if he had it rolling well enough that his long-term job security in Tuscaloosa wasn't in question.Instead, it came amidst Alabama's first playoff run. The Michigan situation was especially tricky and there are still people who believe it would have gotten interesting had Alabama lost to Oklahoma in the first round.Now, DeBoer enters a critical third season at Alabama. And, no matter what he does, he stands in Saban's shadow. It's not just the fact that he followed Saban as Alabama's head coach. Look at the five teams still alive in the CFP -- Georgia, Indiana, Miami, Ole Miss and Oregon. A former Saban assistant/staffer is the head coach at every single one of them. Saban's legacy lives on in college football, and DeBoer is going to keep going up against head coaches like Cignetti who stood by Saban's side as he built college football's greatest dynasty. \nIs DeBoer the guy to lead Alabama back to a national championship? The Crimson Tide looked far away from that level in Pasadena. It'll be another long offseason for DeBoer, who must answer questions about whether the program is headed in the right direction. He made a significant staff change after Year 1 in hiring Ryan Grubb as offensive coordinator. That move didn't work out as well as expected with Grubb's maddening love of second-down run plays rearing its head again against the Hoosiers.Are there other big staff changes to be made? Does DeBoer need to prioritize different things with his program this offseason? He deserves credit for developing resiliency within this team, but it couldn't consistently display the toughness and ferocity that you expect out of Alabama teams. At the Rose Bowl, it was the other crimson team that played that way. \n            ",

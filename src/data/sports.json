    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open tees off on Thursday from Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego, Calif., for the third PGA Tour event of the 2026 season. The Farmers Insurance Open features a viable field, including Brooks Koepka making his high-profile PGA Tour return. Xander Schauffele is the +1400 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds, followed by Ludvig Aberg (+1700) and Cameron Young (+1900). Koepka has +5000 odds to win. Many golf bettors will choose to play  PGA Tour prop bets when placing 2026 Farmers Insurance Open bets, and the SportsLine model has found some Farmers Insurance Open prop bets it projects value in, including backing J.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5, which has +550 odds (risk $100 to win $550). Spaun is priced at +2800 to win the tournament and +255 to crack the top 10. The model also likes Jason Day to defeat Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchup at -140 odds. It also finds value in Si Woo Kim, who finished T6 last week, to finish in the top 10 at +290 odds.

Spaun to finish top 5 (+550)Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Jason Day (-140) over Keegan Bradley in a tournament matchupJ.J. Spaun to finish in the top 5 (+550)Spaun was a longshot winner of last year's U.S. Open for his second career PGA Tour victory, and that played a key part in his best FedEx Cup finish on the Tour, placing T25 after barely cracking the top 100 and finishing 98th the year before. Spaun made 21 of 25 cuts last year after making just 16 of 28 the year before. In his season debut this year, Spaun closed the Sony Open with a 4-under 66 on the final round, and the model thinks he can carry that momentum into this weekend. The 35-year-old finished T15 at last year's Farmers Insurance Open. He ranked seventh on the PGA Tour in total strokes gained last year, and the model projects value in him at +550 odds to crack the top 5 this weekend. Click here to bet on Spaun at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Si Woo Kim to finish top 10 (+290)Kim is a four-time PGA Tour winner, and the 30-year-old had three top-10 finishes last year. He missed the cut at last year's Farmers Insurance Open, but he's made it in six of eight career appearances. Kim finished T6 at last week's American Express and just missed the top 10 in the tournament before, finishing T11 at the Sony Open. He's off to a fast start, ranking sixth on the PGA Tour in scoring average, fifth in driving accuracy and ninth in both strokes gained: Off the Tee and strokes gained: Approach to Green. Given his hot start and experience at the Farmers Insurance Open, the model sees value at him at nearly 3-1 odds to finish in the top 10 this weekend. Click here to bet on Kim at FanDuel, where new users receieve $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins. Jason Day (-140) over Keegan BradleyThis is the first tournament the two will compete in together this year, but their starts to the 2026 PGA Tour season have been significantly different. Bradley missed the cut at the Sony Open, while Day finished T2 at last week's American Express. Day closed with an 8-under 64 on Sunday to finish with the best score for anyone not named Scottie Scheffler, which often seems to be the best you can ask for when golfing against the world's No. 1. Two of Day's 13 career PGA Tour wins have come at the Farmers Insurance Open, and he has seven top-10 finishes over his last 13 appearances in this tournament. Meanwhile, Bradley, the most recent USA Ryder Cup captain, has just one top-10 finish over his last six Farmers Insurance Opens. The model expects Day to fight for a top-five spot, while Bradley doesn't crack its top 10. Caesars Sportsbook offers this Farmers Insurance Open prop bet, and you can click here to bet on Day at Caesars Sportsbook, where new users receive a first bet match up to $250 bonus bet win or lose with the promo code CBSSPORTS250BM.Want more picks for the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open?You've seen the SportsLine model's 2026 Farmers Insurance Open props for this weekend.

    "body": "\n        LeBron James is returning to Cleveland on Wednesday night as the Lakers play the Cavaliers, and there's no debating how important Cleveland has been to James throughout his life. Given the uncertainty about whether this will be his last NBA season or not, Wednesday could mark LeBron's final NBA game played in Cleveland, and the SportsLine Projection Model expects him to put on a show for the Cleveland locals. The model expects his elite passing ability to shine on Wednesday, making James Over 6.5 assists as one of its top NBA player props for Wednesday. The model is also backing Raptors forward RJ Barrett Over 14.5 points and Spurs phenom Victor Wembanyama Under 23.5 points in its best NBA props for Wednesday. Targeting NBA player props will be a popular way to approach Wednesday's NBA betting at online sports betting sites.

Anyone following its NBA betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen huge returns.Best NBA player prop picks on Wednesday:LeBron James, Lakers, Over 6.5 assistsRJ Barrett, Raptors, Over 14.5 pointsVictor Wembanyama, Spurs, Under 23.5 pointsClick here to play these NBA props with the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 wager wins:\nLeBron James, Lakers, Over 6.5 assists (+116)James has gone Under this total in three straight games, but he's still averaging 6.7 assists per game, including 6.9 assists in 13 January contests. He went Over this number in each of the three games prior to going Under it in three straight, and he's gone Over 6.5 assists in four of his last eight contests. Now, add in what playing in Cleveland means for James in what could be his final NBA season and trip to Cleveland, and the model projects James for a strong statistical performance in nearly all categories. He's averaging seven assists over his last four games against the Cavaliers, and at plus-money odds, the model sees value in backing James on Wednesday.

With two full days off and Wednesday marking his third game back, the model projects both a minutes and scoring increase for the 25-year-old who is averaging 19 ppg this season. Barrett went Over this total in 10 of 11 games before his injury. The Raptors play the Knicks, who have allowed more than 105 points in eight of their last 10 games, and the model projects Barrett for 18 points against the team that traded him away. \nBet on Barrett with the latest FanDuel promo code, which gives new users $200 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:Victor Wembanyama, Spurs, Under 23.5 points (-123)The 22-year-old is undeniably one of the top talents in the NBA, but the model projects him to have a tough time against a Rockets team that also has the size, athleticism and versatility to battle his strengths. The Rockets have the No. 4 scoring defense (110.5 ppg allowed), and they can throw a combination of Kevin Durant (6-11), Jabari Smith Jr. (6-11) or Alperen Sengun (6-11) at Wemby. Both their starting guards are at least 6-7, so the Rockets can switch on and off the Spurs' phenom and make him work for open looks and drives. Wemby has gone Under this total in two of his last three games, and in each of his last four games against Houston. He averages 17 ppg over his career against the Rockets, going Over this total just once in nine matchups. The model projects him for 20.3 points, and DraftKings has the best odds, with other sportsbooks juicing the Under odds to -130. Bet on Wembanyama with the latest DraftKings promo code, which gives new users $300 in bonus bets if their first $5 wager wins:\nWant more Wednesday NBA picks?You've seen the model's NBA picks for some popular NBA player props for Wednesday.

    "body": "\n        The Cleveland Browns are working to hire former Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken as their next head coach, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. Monken spent the last three seasons as John Harbaugh's play-caller with the Ravens and previously worked as Cleveland's OC in 2019.The Browns fired Kevin Stefanski at the end of the season, but retained general manager Andrew Berry, who was a leading voice in drafting quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. Monken will work with both quarterbacks along with making a decision on Deshaun Watson ahead of the 2026 season.Monken was also in the mix to land the New York Giants' OC vacancy, forcing Harbaugh to look elsewhere. Three coaches — Mike McDaniel, Jesse Minter and Grant Udinski — all pulled out of Cleveland's search as targets with Monken, Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase and Browns defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz being the eventual finalists.  Cleveland's new hire is part of a mass restructuring within the AFC North, which including Pittsburgh hiring Mike McCarthy to replace Mike Tomlin and the Ravens hiring Minter to as Harbaugh's replacement.\nMonken served under Kirby Smart as Georgia's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2020-22, winning a pair of national titles. He orchestrated a balanced attack led by Stetson Bennett at quarterback and parlayed that rise into a return to the NFL with the Ravens in 2023. At Georgia, the Bulldogs were 37-3 overall during Monken's tenure.Quarterback will quickly fall under the microscope during Monken's tenure. Sanders went 3-4 as the starter this season, and completed 56.6% of his passes for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions in eight total games played. He became the first Browns quarterback to win his first career start since 1995 and despite struggles with efficiency in his first season, is reportedly a Pro Bowl honoree. During his previous one-year stint in Cleveland, Monken helped the Browns generate a strong rushing attack behind Nick Chubb in 2019. Chubb rushed for 1,494 yards, the second-highest total in the NFL that season.\nThe Browns finished 6-10 with Monken as offensive coordinator and fired Freddie Kitchens as coach. Monken's resurgence with the Ravens featured two of the league's highest-scoring offenses his first two years behind Derrick Henry and Jackson. During the 2024 season, Baltimore led the league in total offense and rushing offense.\n            ",

Draft prospects will have the opportunity to go through medical evaluations, meet with teams, participate in on-field workouts and take part in media interviews. It is a conveyor belt of sorts where players go from one station to the next over the course of that week. Fans are able to watch on-field drills at Lucas Oil Stadium and take part in other NFL experiences. Those unable to attend can still watch on television and other streaming platforms. Here is everything you need to know about the event in Indianapolis:When is the NFL combine?The 2026 NFL Scouting Combine will take place from Feb. 22 to March 2.

Measurements and media interviews are held at the local convention center. Lengthy medical testing is conducted at nearby hospitals as well. \nThe event has been held in Indianapolis since 1987 and will continue to be held there through at least 2028. There had been some chatter about the event potentially moving elsewhere.  2026 NFL Draft orderHere is a look at the top 10 picks:\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. Las Vegas Raiders (3-14)Las Vegas overextended last offseason by drafting a running back in the top 10 and trading for a 35-year-old quarterback despite having one of the league's worst rosters. As a result, they fired head coach Pete Carroll after one season and are now picking even earlier in the draft. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. New York Jets (3-14)The Jets finished with one of the worst records in the league, but at least they have a plan and put themselves in a position to change the course of their franchise. Over the next two years, New York has five first-round picks. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. Arizona Cardinals (3-14)Arizona made the decision to part with head coach Jonathan Gannon. It would not be a surprise if they moved on from Kyler Murray as well. The problem is that there are not a wealth of options to replace Murray.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. Tennessee Titans (3-14)The positive momentum Tennessee had built over the past month came to a frustrating end in the season finale. Still, Cam Ward's strong finish to the 2025 campaign should give Titans fans hope.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. New York Giants (4-13)There are reasons to be optimistic about Jaxson Dart's future with the franchise. He brought life to an offense that could have easily wallowed in self-pity following the Malik Nabers and Andrew Thomas injuries. With the hiring of John Harbaugh as their new coach, a bounce back could happen sooner than most would expect.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    6. Cleveland Browns (5-12)The Browns made the decision to part with head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons. He did lead the franchise to its first playoff win post-expansion, but may not be any closer to identifying the quarterback of the future. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    7. Washington Commanders (5-12)Next season is an easy sell for Washington. If Jayden Daniels returns healthy, then the Commanders will be competitive once again, but there are a lot of needs on that roster. An attempt to microwave those weaknesses last offseason did not work out. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    8. New Orleans Saints (6-11)The Saints' season ended just as fans were clamoring for more of Tyler Shough. He looks like the clear favorite to open next season as the starting quarterback, bringing a level of optimism that simply didn't exist earlier in the year.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    9. Kansas City Chiefs (6-11)Kansas City will enter next season in unfamiliar territory: the hungry underdog.

There appears to be good depth among the wide receivers, edge rushers, tight ends and cornerbacks.

    "body": "\n        With Super Bowl LX fast approaching on Feb. 8, we're starting to get a sense of which stars will appear during ad breaks in the action between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. Companies have already started to tease their commercials, and this year figures to have as many celebrity cameos as ever.Last year, the list of celebs in Super Bowl LIX commercials ranged from David Beckham to Seal to Matthew McConaughey to Tim Robinson. It was a slate that will be hard to top, but if the early teasers for Super Bowl LX are any indication, the 2026 commercials will be star-studded affairs again.We already know that at least one set of celebrities from the Super Bowl LIX ads will be returning for Super Bowl LX. That's the trio of Peyton Manning, Post Malone and Shane Gillis, who are featured in a teaser for Bud Light. Outside of those three, stars like Sabrina Carpenter and Emma Stone will be making their Super Bowl commercial debuts.And as we get closer to Super Bowl LX, we'll get more previews of what's to come on the big night. Might we be getting our first looks at a commercial or two that will land on our list of the Top 25 of all-time?\nHere is every Super Bowl LX commercial teaser that we've seen so far:Sabrina Carpenter for Pringles\nPringles has brought plenty of star power in the last two years with Chris Pratt and Nick Offerman taking on starring roles. Now, the company is breaking out the big guns with pop sensation Sabrina Carpenter.Bradley Cooper and Matthew McConaughey for Uber Eats\nIf you've watched any football at all this season, then you know Cooper has been fighting against the conspiracy that the NFL is just a facade to sell food. Well, it seems like he and McConaughey (the star of last year's Uber Eats commercial) will get to the bottom of it during Super Bowl LX.\n        \n            \n                Super Bowl commercials: Top 25 all time, ranked\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPeyton Manning, Post Malone and Shane Gillis reunite for Bud Light\nIn Super Bowl LIX, this trio brought us a dad-inspired yard party. This year, the team is on its way to a wedding. Will Bud Light be able to top what it did with these three a year ago?\nEmma Stone for Squarespace\nHitters don't get much heavier than this. The actor-director duo of Stone and Yorgos Lanthimos have teamed up for Oscar-worthy productions like Poor Things, The Favourite, Kinds of Kindness and Bugonia. Now, they're teaming up for this Super Bowl LX commercial.Ben Stiller and Benson Boone for Instacart\nComedy icon (and \"Severance\" genius) Ben Stiller will join forces with pop star Benson Boone in this ad. It almost looks like Stiller will be channeling a little bit of White Goodman for this role, which is exciting as a big Dodgeball fan from way back.Elijah Wood for Skittles\nI always appreciate when a company leans into a bit of weirdness, and Elijah Wood delivering Skittles a some kind of mythical creature certainly qualifies. This one has a lot of promise.\nDanny McBride and Keegan-Michael Key for State Farm\nComedians McBride (\"Eastbound and Down\") and Key (\"Key and Peele\") are teaming up to sell you half-baked insurance, and they're certainly not afraid to admit it. We'll see where State Farm goes after running its Bate-man campaign for much of the 2025 NFL season.Guy Fieri for Bosch\nBy now, everyone has probably seen the disturbing images of Guy Fieri dressed as a ... regular guy ... on social media. It's apparently for this year's commercial from Bosch, and we get a little tease of what's to come from the company above.Chloe Kim and T.J. Oshie for Michelob Ultra\nMichelob Ultra delivered one of the highlights last year with Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara crushing other celebrities in pickleball. The company is taking a slightly different tact in 2026 as it leans into the Olympics, which will have started just days before Super Bowl LX kicks off.\nClydesdales return for Budweiser\nEveryone's favorite horses are back in 2026, as if that was ever in doubt. The Clydesdales seem captivated by a mystery animal that's invaded their stable. Budweiser almost always delivers with this classic format.Totino's brings back Chazmo\nLast year, the comedy duo of Tim Robinson and Sam Richardson teamed up to bring us Chazmo. The Pizza Roll-loving alien will make his return for Super Bowl LX ... or will he?Kinder Bueno\nKinder Bueno didn't give us much with this teaser -- just hinting at an intergalactic adventure -- but I don't mind it. Sometimes, it's best to just be surprised during the actual Super Bowl itself.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The legendary Bill Belichick will not be a first-ballot Hall of Famer after he fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This was Belichick's first year of eligibility. Belichick will make next year's class (2027), but there is a special pantheon reserved for \"first-ballot\" inductees, in any sport, and Belichick's legacy will be forever dulled, albeit only so slightly, by not receiving that honor. It's a shocking outcome that has some calling for voter reform with the NFL world up in arms, including three-time Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes and three-time Defensive Player of the Year and NFL on CBS broadcaster J.J. Watt. Belichick is one of the greatest coaches in NFL history, if not the very best. The résumé speaks for itself:\nEight Super Bowl titles (NFL-record six as head coach of the New England Patriots and two as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants)333 career wins including playoffs (second-most by a head coach behind Don Shula)31 playoff wins (most by head coach in NFL history)Belichick's body of work is the best of any coach in NFL history, and undoubtedly better than the four other head coaches since 1970 who were enshrined in Canton on the first ballot. Bill BelichickVince LombardiTom LandryChuck NollDon ShulaNFL titles65242Reg season wins30296250193328Playoff wins319201619Reg/post wins333105270209347Unlike those four head coaches, who had squeaky-clean resumes, the sticking point with Belichick (per ESPN) are the multiple scandals (Spygate and Deflategate) that he was embroiled in during his time with the Patriots. In 2007, Belichick was fined $500,000 -- the largest fine ever levied against an NFL coach to that point -- for his involvement in the Spygate scandal. The Patriots also lost a first-round pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. In 2015, the Patriots were fined $1 million after an investigation found they deflated footballs during the 2014 AFC Championship game. They also forfeited a 2016 first-round pick and 2017 fourth-round pick and quarterback Tom Brady was suspended for four games. Bill Polian, a former Bills and Colts general manager and rival of Belichick's Patriots, reportedly told voters Belichick should \"wait a year\" because of the 2007 Spygate scandal according to an anonymous voter. Polian at first appeared to deny that claim Tuesday night, telling Sports Illustrated the report was \"categorically untrue\" and that he had voted for Belichick. But in an another interview Tuesday, with ESPN's Don Van Natta Jr., who had first broken the news of Belichick's snub, Polian said he could not remember with 100% certainty if he voted for Belichick, saying he was 95% sure he did. Polian is 83-years-old. \nSince we do not yet know the final vote count, the blame of course can not be pinned solely on Polian (though it would be unfortunate if Belichick was stuck at 39 votes and it comes out that Polian did not in fact vote for him). Polian did say he voted for Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who is a Hall of Fame finalist for the first time in his 14th year of eligibility and is the sole finalist in the contributor category for the 2026 class. Were some voters just unable to square the idea of putting Kraft and Belichick on their ballots in the same year? Did their beef complicate any feelings? We do not know. Belichick and Kraft were competing with Roger Craig, Ken Anderson and L.C. Greenwood for one to three spots separate from the 15 modern-era finalists. Mike Sando, a Hall of Fame voter and NFL writer for The Athletic, says the voting system could explain the issue here.\nBesides that, we know Belichick's legacy was not helped by the breakup with Tom Brady in 2020. Brady, of course, won his seventh Super Bowl in his first season with the Buccaneers while Belichick did not win a playoff game in his final four seasons with the Patriots after Brady left. Only one of Belichick's NFL-record 31 playoff wins came without Brady. He had an 84-103 record without Brady in his career as an NFL head coach compared with 249-75 with him (including playoffs). That information might settle the debate between who was more important to the Patriots dynasty, but it should in no way factor in Belichick not getting his gold jacket on the first try. His fingerprints were all over the eight Super Bowl teams he was part of. 1986: The Giants allowed three points in their first two playoff games before beating the Broncos 39-20 in the Super Bowl. 1990: Belichick's defensive gameplan to stop the Bills 'K-Gun' offense in Super Bowl XXV is in the Hall of Fame. His coaching was also instrumental in stopping the 49ers three-peat in the 1990 NFC title game which the Giants won 15-13 with backup quarterback Jeff Hostetler. 2001: The Patriots pulled off the 2nd-largest upset in Super Bowl history (14-point underdog) and held the 'Greatest Show on Turf' to 17 points.  2003: The Patriots beat co-MVPs Steve McNair and Peyton Manning on the way to the Super Bowl. They held each of their teams (Titans and Colts) to 14 points. 2004: Belichick once again stifled Peyton Manning and the Colts with a physical game plan in a 20-3 win vs. Indianapolis before reeling off two more wins for another title, including the Super Bowl victory vs. Andy Reid and the Eagles. 2014: Malcolm Butler's goal line interception is one of the most stunning plays in NFL history and a testament to Bill Belichick's 'next man up' montra. Butler was an undrafted rookie from West Alabama, a Division II school.2016: The Patriots pulled off the largest comeback win in Super Bowl history, down 28-3 vs. the Falcons. 2018: Belichick won his eighth and final Super Bowl by holding the Rams and Sean McVay's high-powered offense to three points. The Patriots also beat Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in the AFC title game. I'm racking my brain for other possible explanations, because how else are we supposed to reconcile this? At watering holes across America they could point to Belichick's personal life and a 4-8 season as North Carolina's head coach as further points to diminish his standing, but both would be ridiculous arguments against his Hall of Fame worthiness. Belichick has the most Super Bowl wins by a head coach in NFL history, by a margin of two.  \n                                                                    CBS Sports Research\n                                                            There's Belichick's coaching tree during the Patriots dynasty, which never bore premium fruit. Romeo Crennel, Brian Daboll, Brian Flores, Joe Judge, Eric Mangini, Jerod Mayo, Bill O'Brien and Josh McDaniels, among others, found little success as NFL head coaches. Are people holding that against him? It would ignore how the greatest head coach in college football history, Nick Saban, was the Browns' defensive coordinator from 1991-94 under Belichick. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel played for eight seasons under Belichick. He's now one win away from a Super Bowl in his first year. Until more answers come out, we are left to lean on the explanations of a flawed voting process and voters who potentially wanted to punish Belichick for his role in the aforementioned scandals.Belichick isn't the first person to have his Pro Football Hall of Fame inducted delayed. Terrell Owens, who has the third-most receiving yards in NFL history (15,934), didn't get into the Hall of Fame until his third year of eligibility because of his reputation. That sounds even more ridiculous now than it did 10 years ago. Many worthy first-ballot coaches have also had to wait:Bill Parcells waited until his fourth year as a finalist. He was initially turned down in 2001 and 2002 due to rumors of his return to coaching (which he did from 2003-06 with the Cowboys). Former NFL MVP Lawrence Taylor said this after the news of his election. \"If Bill didn't finally get in this year, they needed to shut the Hall of Fame down. The whole thing wouldn't have meant anything without him in there.\" The same sentiment applies to Belichick. Bill Walsh elected in his fourth year of eligibility in 1993 after leading the 49ers to three Super Bowls in the 1980s and pioneering the 'West Coast Offense'. Joe Gibbs waited until his fourth year of eligibility after winning three Super Bowl with WashingtonJohn Madden waited over two decades despite holding the best record by any head coach with at least 100 games coached (.759 win percentage) in NFL history and a Super Bowl title with the Raiders. Perhaps his short tenure as a head coach and his broadcasting career were factors in the wait.And many in other sports have had to wait and may never be in. The all-time hits king (Pete Rose), the all-time home run leader (Barry Bonds) and the pitcher with the most Cy Young awards (Roger Clemens) are not in the Baseball Hall of Fame for their past deeds, which we would judge as worse than the scandals involving Belichick.  There may be precedent, there may be the various \"gates\" he found himself tangled up in, and there's a few other minor explanations that amount to the tiniest of possible footnotes. At the end of the day, it's ridiculous that we even have to have this conversation. Look at Belichick's body of work and it's impossible that isn't being inducted this year. It should be a slam dunk. It makes no sense. We guess, as Belichick would say, we're on to 2027. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 Farmers Insurance Open begins on Thursday with a strong field headed to the Torrey Pines South Course in San Diego. Scottie Scheffler, who won his 2026 season debut at The American Express, isn't playing this week, opening up the field a bit for big names such as Xander Schueffele, Ludvig Aberg and Patrick Cantlay. Schauffele, the highest-ranked player in the field at No. 6 in the OWGR, is the +1300 favorite in the latest 2026 Farmers Insurance Open odds from FanDuel Sportsbook. Aberg is close behind at +1700, followed by Cantlay at +1900.Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka is a +5500 longshot as he makes his PGA Tour return after recently leaving LIV Golf. The first tee times come at 12:10 p.m. ET. Before locking in any 2026 Farmers Insurance Open 2026 picks, or making any PGA DFS picks on sites like FanDuel or DraftKings, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its golf betting picks since that point, nailing tournament after tournament.This same model has also nailed a whopping 16 majors entering the weekend, including the 2025 Masters -- its fourth Masters in a row -- as well as this year's PGA Championship and Open Championship.

Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. 2026 Farmers Insurance Open predictions One major surprise the model is calling for at the Farmers Insurance Open 2026: Si Woo Kim, who is one of the favorites, stumbles and falls well out of the top 5. He's a golfer to fade this week. Kim is off to a hot start this season with a T11 at the Sony Open and a T6 at The American Express last week. He was in the final group on Sunday before before a fourth-round 72. This event has been a struggle for Kim, however, as he has no top-10 finishes in eight tries and has missed the cut twice in his last appearances at this tournament. See who else to fade here. \nAnother surprise: The model calls Cantlay one of the best betting values this week. He's a golfer to target if you're looking for a big return. He finished T13 at The American Express with four sub-70 rounds. The California native doesn't have a great track record at this event, but he did shoot a first-round 65 last year at Torrey Pines before struggling over the weekend.

    "body": "\n        We're in a transitional stage when it comes to trade deadline sellers. The past few years have been dominated by a pretty stable group of tankers. The Washington Wizards. The Utah Jazz. The Charlotte Hornets. The Brooklyn Nets. A few teams have graduated. A few teams have joined the fray this season. But we've known who the rebuilding teams have been for a few years now, and that's about to change.Washington just traded for Trae Young. While they're going to tank out the remainder of this season to keep their top-eight protected first-round pick, that move was presumably made with the intention of playing more competitively next season. Charlotte is already more than competitive. The Hornets have a top-five offense since the beginning of December. Brooklyn has no incentive to lose next season. The Nets owe 2027 swap rights on their first-round pick to the Rockets. The Jazz can at least stop with their more brazen lineup shenanigans geared toward losing. They also owe a top-eight protected pick this season, but it expires afterward, so the idea is seemingly to start trying to win next season.That means this year's sellers by and large are going to be a bit more strategic than usual. They're not just going to sell off all of the useless talent they can for the sake of increasing their draft capital. They're going to be more strategic, trimming fat where they can but likely prioritizing not only their core players, but anyone who might make sense alongside them. Where big names are concerned, as is the case with Anthony Davis and Ja Morant, the teams in question at least have younger players in place that they can prioritize. There's really only one likely seller out there that's totally directionless, and to be frank, that's been the case for the Sacramento Kings for most of the past two decades.So let's get into our guide to the sellers of the 2026 NBA trade deadline. We'll cover where each possible seller sits, who they might move, what they might want and what they're ultimately trying to accomplish in this phase of their roster-building efforts. Between the buyer's guide published Tuesday and today's seller's guide, 29 of the 30 teams have been addressed. The lone holdout, Atlanta, has already made its big move in trading Trae Young, and with losses accumulating, are unlikely to buy. However, given the youth of the roster and their strong pick and cap outlook, there's no real reason to sell either. They were the odd team out. The 10 teams below are our likely sellers.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Chicago BullsThe Bulls have an idea of who they want to be: a slightly remixed version of the Indiana Pacers. To that effort, they have two players they seem genuinely committed to: Josh Giddey and Matas Buzelis. Rookie lottery pick Noa Essengue got hurt and has barely played, but he's still so much of a mystery box that he's likely untouchable. Everyone else is probably on the table, and there are plenty of players who might appeal to better teams.Everyone seems to want Ayo Dosunmu, who is playing the best basketball of his career and capable on both ends of the court. Of course, the Bulls could just re-sign him in free agency this offseason, so there's no imperative to trade him. A Coby White deal feels likelier, as he is also an impending free agent in the midst of a down year. Anyone looking for a starting-caliber scoring guard with a low cap figure, like the Timberwolves and Clippers, would probably be interested. Nikola Vučević is the last big name here, but his pricey cap figure makes a trade difficult.The Bulls have a history of trading veterans for young players rather than picks. They turned Alex Caruso into Giddey and Lonzo Ball into Isaac Okoro. Therefore, don't be surprised if they seek out more recent first-round picks struggling with their current teams. This is part of why Minnesota is such a popular Coby White destination. Rob Dillingham would be a very Chicago acquisition.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Charlotte HornetsA core has seemingly developed here. LaMelo Ball is playing his way out of trade talks. Brandon Miller and Kon Knueppel are untouchable. You can pry Moussa Diabaté out of Charlotte's cold, dead hands. The idea for now would seemingly be to clear out brush. There are a lot of veterans making meaningful money here that probably won't be part of the Charlotte team that's trying to contend in a few years.The biggest name is Miles Bridges, and there is such a lack of forwards on the trade market that he'd still likely fetch a decent offer despite limitations as a shooter and defender. He puts up counting stats, but the on-off data is pretty clear that the Hornets are better when he rests. One first-round pick is probably the right ballpark. Josh Green, making around mid-level money next season, could probably net a second-rounder or two. Collin Sexton's cap figure might be too high, but keep an eye on the Clippers, who need another bench scorer and have second-rounders to spare.This Charlotte front office has been very eager to liquidate veterans for draft picks when they aren't in their long-term plans. They did it with P.J. Washington, Mark Williams and Terry Rozier. They won't hesitate to move those veterans for good offers, and their balance sheet is long enough to take on longer-term money if needed. With more than $14 million in room below the luxury-tax line, the Hornets have plenty of flexibility to work with.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Brooklyn NetsThere are two sides to Brooklyn's seller status: talent and money. Michael Porter Jr. is maybe the most desirable player on the market right now. He's having an All-Star-caliber breakout season as Brooklyn's top option, but his time in Denver proved he's capable of playing a smaller role as well. Any contender looking for shooting at the forward spot should be in the mix for his services. He's worth multiple valuable assets at this stage. Nic Claxton isn't quite as valuable, but on a descending-salary contract and with Day'Ron Sharpe impressing as his backup, he'd surely generate interest from the many teams looking for a long-term big man (Pacers, Celtics, Lakers etc...).But Brooklyn's other selling point as a seller is its cap space. The Nets have around $15 million or so in space below the cap and nearly $50 million in room below the luxury tax. That makes the Nets the ultimate deadline facilitator. Anyone who wants to shed some salary or needs a third team to make the financials work on a deal is probably starting with Brooklyn. The Nets should be able to use that space to extract even more draft capital before the deadline.Keep in mind, though, that the Nets don't control their own 2027 first-round pick. Houston has it. The Nets are probably planning to try to be competitive next season. That might mean keeping their veterans if no viable offers come along. The need to tank this year is significant without control over next year's pick, but teams can always find reasons to shut players down if needed. The Nets have a history of declining good trades in the name of waiting for great ones. Don't expect to swipe their players for a bargain.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Washington WizardsWashington ironically acted as a buyer already at this deadline, trading nothing but cap relief to the Hawks for Trae Young. Aside from Young, there are literally only three players left on the roster above the age of 25. Marvin Bagley and Anthony Gill aren't netting much, so don't think of the Wizards as a player-centric seller.They are, however, an obvious cap facilitator. Washington has almost $30 million in room below the luxury tax and even with Young, is looking at around $50 million in cap space next offseason. They can afford to not only help teams save money this season, but take on longer-term deals for a draft pick premium. Khris Middleton, making $33 million on an expiring deal, is the obvious name to move in such an arrangement. If he isn't traded, it wouldn't be surprising to see him get bought out, either. Washington bought out Marcus Smart over the summer, so it's something the Wizards are prepared to do situationally.With Young in place, the Wizards probably want to take a step next season. Bad salary might not bother them much if it's attached to a good player. There's room for the Wizards to get extra draft capital and improve their roster moving forward.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Milwaukee BucksLook, by now, you're surely familiar with the ongoing Giannis Antetokounmpo-induced dilemma going on in Milwaukee. The Bucks won't trade him until he asks them to. He, at least to this point, is not known to have asked them to. They should have traded him over the summer. They should have traded him earlier in the season. Giannis hurt his calf last week. And at this point, the Bucks are probably best-served waiting until the summer, when more teams are financially flexible and have access to an extra year's worth of draft picks.But Antetokounmpo isn't the only bit of business Milwaukee can take care of this deadline. There would probably be interest in Bobby Portis from frontcourt needy teams, and whether the Bucks are going into a rebuild or retooling around Antetokounmpo over the summer, a high-level third big man is probably a luxury this team can no longer justify. He's not getting a first-round pick at this stage of his career, but multiple second rounders seems reasonable. Gary Trent Jr. hasn't been the massive value the Bucks assumed when they nabbed him for the minimum two summers ago, but his cap figure is so low that someone in need of depth would surely give up some second-round capital for him as well. The Bucks also have around $14 million in room below the luxury-tax line, so they could help someone save money for draft picks if the right deal comes along.There are bigger post-Giannis questions to be answered here. There would probably be interest in Myles Turner and Ryan Rollins from other teams, but that would have to wait until Antetokounmpo gets moved. If he does get traded before the deadline though? It's open season on this roster.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Memphis GrizzliesThe Trae Young trade set the market for Ja Morant. If there were a first-round pick or a good younger player out there for him, well, we'd probably know it by now. If the Grizzlies are trading Morant, it's probably going to be some variety of cap dump. With two years of max salary left on his contract, a lengthy injury history and declining numbers, it's just hard to imagine him generating much substantial positive value. Either the Grizzlies are ready to cut ties and accept that, or they'll bring him back and try again to rehab his value.Jaren Jackson Jr. is a much more complicated case. There would likely be substantial interest in his services. Big men who can protect the basket and shoot 3s are rare. Even on a hefty extension starting next season, there would be several teams interested in Jackson. He'd likely command something in the neighborhood of the Desmond Bane price if Memphis agreed to move him: several first-round picks, and maybe even more if the Grizzlies took back bad salary. Detroit is the obvious potential suitor. Golden State made a lot of sense before Jimmy Butler got hurt. The Lakers probably need the added pick flexibility the offseason provides. A sleeper that makes some sense, given its defense-first philosophy and need for shooting, would be Portland.The Grizzlies are tricky to project because there's not a fixed direction here. Do they want to tear it all down? Get off of Morant but otherwise stay competitive with Jackson? Or is there a path to reconciliation with Morant? There's no obvious organizational directive, so the Grizzlies could go in a number of directions here.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Dallas MavericksThe Mavericks are in a pretty interesting position. The obvious reason to trade Anthony Davis was to initiate a tank. Dallas controls its first-round pick this year, and then doesn't again until 2031. However, Davis getting hurt sort of solved that organically. The Mavericks will be bad enough to play the lottery. So what is the goal from there?With Davis and Kyrie Irving coming back next season, the Mavericks have a chance to be pretty good. Does that have value to Dallas? Is getting Cooper Flagg playoff reps early a priority? If so, it would be hard to justify trading players like Daniel Gafford and Naji Marshall, whom other teams want but would be important for the Mavericks next season. Marshall might be justifiable given Dallas' wing depth, but Gafford is pretty important in light of the injuries Davis and Dereck Lively have dealt with. Dallas went from too many big men to not enough healthy ones pretty quickly.But if the goal is just to prioritize Flagg's prime and setting the team up for success two or three years from now? Yea, Gafford could net a first-round pick from the center-needy teams and Marshall might even be able to get a late one as well. A Davis trade is probably off of the table for now. His wrist injury probably precludes serious interest from contenders. But that is a topic Dallas will surely revisit over the summer.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Utah JazzThe player pool here is pretty small. Jusuf Nurkić is a nice backup center, but at around $19 million in salary, he only really makes sense if someone is dumping a bigger contract to get him. Svi Mykhailiuk is having a very nice shooting season, but has such a cheap contract with multiple non-guaranteed years that the Jazz would likely be happy just to keep him in the fold moving forward.The Jazz, like the Wizards and Nets, are a very likely facilitator. Utah has almost $44 million in luxury-tax room, but more importantly, it has a giant $18.4 million trade exception left over from the John Collins trade that it can use to absorb a contract from another team. That's probably the most valuable cap-dumping mechanism on the market right now. Depending on the contract in question, it's not unreasonable to think the Jazz could get a first-round pick to take on the right deal.By all accounts, the Jazz plan to be competitive next year. They've had to work hard just to try to ensure they keep their first-round pick this year, which goes to Oklahoma City if it doesn't fall in the top eight. Between a returning Walker Kessler, the breakout of Keyonte George and several other promising players on rookie deals, the Jazz are ready to start winning. That probably takes a Lauri Markkanen deal off of the table at this point.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Sacramento KingsLet's get this out of the way quickly: it doesn't seem like there's interest in the big-name guards. No one seems interested in paying Zach LaVine the max next year, or taking on the $10 million guaranteed to an aging DeMar DeRozan. Malik Monk has two more years left on his deal, and that's scaring possible trade partners off.There are two interesting names to watch here. Obviously, Domantas Sabonis is one of them. His defensive vulnerabilities cap his value to an extent, but teams with strong defense elsewhere, like Toronto or Golden State, could talk themselves into him as an offensive hub. He's still an elite rebounder with a whole range of valuable offensive functions. There's probably an offer out there of at least one first-round pick, perhaps multiple if bad money is going the other way (such as Toronto's Jakob Poeltl).The other notable name here is Keon Ellis. He's headed for free agency this offseason and the Kings have bizarrely underutilized him, but he's a ferocious defensive guard that makes his 3s. In other words, he's someone the entire league could use, and he's making roughly the minimum this year. That means most teams can trade for him. The Kings are said to want a first-round pick, so it seems as though whoever coughs up the best one is going to be able to nab him.The Kings are a teardown. Keegan Murray is the only player on the team they seem committed to keeping. They'll be picking at the top of the draft for a few years now, and until they have a foundation, it seems as though basically everyone should be available.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Orleans PelicansThe Pelicans have players available at seemingly every price point. Want to pay a king's ransom for a high-level difference-maker? Trey Murphy and Herb Jones, locked into team-friendly long-term deals at the league's scarcest position, are here. Murphy is a burgeoning All-Star scorer with a rare combination of shooting and athleticism. Jones can defend basically anyone on the planet. You're not getting either without a hefty package of draft picks, and even then, the Pelicans might just keep them. But these are players virtually everyone wants, and it doesn't seem as though they're entirely off of the table.Looking for more modest additions? Jose Alvarado is a great defensive guard that holds his own on offense is making a pittance at $4.5 million. Whichever team swipes him for a handful of second-round picks will be better off for it. Yves Missi is a promising young center with two years left on his rookie deal. He's shown flashes in New Orleans and would seemingly do even better playing for a more competent organization. Someone is going to get good value on him as well.The Pelicans are one of the hardest teams in the league to read. Nobody seems to have a clue what the long-term vision is. They've acted as though they're swatting Zion Williamson offers away left and right, and yes, he has played well, but there's no world in which he and Derik Queen are viable together defensively. This team badly needs shooting. Oh, and the Hawks have their first-round pick in June. Until we have a better sense of what the Pelicans are actually planning, everyone but rookies Queen and Jeremiah Fears should be viewed as gettable.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        When the U.S. men's hockey team goes to the 2026 Milano-Cortina Olympics, it will try to shake off an ugly history of overseas performances. Since NHL players first went to the Olympics in 1998, the Americans have never medaled outside of North America. Can that change next month?While the U.S. has gotten some strong results at Olympics held in North America -- silver in Salt Lake City (2002) and Vancouver (2010) -- it has not fared nearly as well across the pond. In three attempts, the Americans have not finished better than fourth, and they have a combined six wins.1998 (Nagano)2006 (Turin)2014 (Sochi)Record1-3-01-4-14-2-0Goal differential-5-1+13Finished6th8th4thTeam USA's performance at the 2006 Turin Olympics was especially bad. That goal differential was propped up by a rather unimpressive 4-1 win over Kazakhstan, and Team USA tied Latvia. Despite that, the U.S. still managed to reach the quarterfinals, where it lost to Finland.Explaining that big disparity in results is a little challenging. Did the hometown fans make a difference in 2002 and -- to a lesser degree -- in 2010? Does the travel really make that big of an impact? It seems unlikely. Whatever the reason, the Americans have consistently come home empty-handed, and that would be an especially shocking and devastating result with the strength of the roster in 2026.Let's take a deeper dive into why the 2026 Olympic hockey team is poised to do what other teams couldn't.Improved developmentFor much of the 20th century, the United States struggled to develop stars at the same rate as other countries like Canada, Sweden and Russia. There's no better evidence of that than the World Junior Championship, an under-20 tournament held annually since 1977. The Americans didn't win their first tournament until 2004, and they earned silver or bronze just three times in the prior 27 attempts. Since winning their first gold medal in 2004, the Americans have won the event seven times, including back-to-back championships in 2024-25.That drastic improvement was preceded by a sharp bump in youth hockey numbers. According to USA Hockey, there was a total of 195,125 registered ice hockey players in the 1990-91 season. By the 1997-98 season, that number had more than doubled to 401,218. Registration crossed the 500,000 mark in 2010-11. During that period, USA Hockey began the U.S. National Team Development Program, which identifies elite talent and develops those players into professionals. Since the founding of that program in 1996, it has produced 432 NHL draftees.\n        \n            \n                Team USA 2026 Olympic hockey roster: Tkachuk brothers team up to lead Americans in Italy, Robertson snubbed\n                \n                    Austin Nivison                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSeventeen of those U.S. NTDP draftees are on the 2026 Olympic roster. Everyone on the team was born between 1991 and 2002, which means this squad is a product of the youth hockey explosion in the U.S. as well as a more concerted effort by USA Hockey to mold those players into stars. The 1998 and 2006 Olympic teams didn't get that benefit, and you started to see improvement in 2014, even if it didn't result in a medal. After all, the Americans were two shots away from being in the gold medal game after a 1-0 semifinal loss to Canada.Playing better overseas starts with bringing better players to those tournaments. As obvious as it sounds, that's probably the biggest reason why Team USA is poised to change the narrative in Europe this year.Major strides in goaltendingThis section goes hand-in-hand with the development we just discussed above, but few things have improved within U.S. Hockey as much as the goaltending. Compare the 2026 Olympic trio -- Connor Hellebuyck, Jake Oettinger and Jeremy Swayman -- with those that Team USA brought in 1998, 2006 and 2014, and there is little comparison.1998John VanbiesbrouckGuy HebertMike RichterIn the case of all three goaltenders, they were talented but closer to the end of their careers than the beginning. Vanbiesbrouck had a Vezina Trophy on his resume, but it came more than a decade earlier in 1986. Hebert had some high peaks in his career, but never finished higher than fourth in Vezina voting. Richter had a Stanley Cup to his name, but he was also in the midst of a down season when he went to the Olympics.2006Rick DiPietroRobert EscheJohn GrahameThis is probably the worst trio the U.S. ever brought overseas for the Olympics. DiPietro is considered one of the biggest busts in NHL Draft history, Esche never played more than 40 games in a single season and Grahame was a full-time starter for one season in 2005-06.2014Jimmy HowardRyan MillerJonathan QuickThis is a solid goaltending room, and to be fair, stopping the puck wasn't the problem for the 2014 Olympic team. Miller was a Vezina Trophy winner, and Quick already had a Conn Smythe Trophy under his belt (he would win a second Stanley Cup just months after the Olympics). The weak link here was probably Howard, who was very good for much of his 14-year career but never really reached star status.\nThe nine goaltenders listed above combined for two Vezina Trophy wins. Hellebuyck has three and has already established himself as the best American goalie in history while still in his prime. Hellebuyck is seventh among American goalies all-time in wins (332), fourth in save percentage (.917) and second in shutouts (45).Oettinger is fifth in GAA (2.54), 10th in save percentage (.911) and 17th in wins (165) at the age of 27. Swayman, also 27, is in the top 25 of all three categories as well.Goaltending has become the strength of USA Hockey. Especially with Russia unable to compete in 2026, the Americans should have the clear edge in goal against every team they face. That was not something that could be said in past trips overseas.\nFavorable pathTeam USA has a very favorable draw in its effort to medal across the pond with NHLers for the first time ever. The Americans will avoid Canada, Sweden, Finland, Czechia, Switzerland and Slovakia until at least the first stage of the knockout round.Team USA's toughest test in the round robin stage will likely come against Germany, a team with +6500 odds to win gold, according to DraftKings. That should -- and \"should\" is a key word for this team -- mean the Americans (+200 to win gold, just behind favorites Canada at +115) will reach the quarterfinals without encountering too much turbulence. Coach Mike Sullivan should be able to rotate goalies as he sees fit while also keeping his skaters rested until the heavyweight fights begin.Meanwhile, Canada draws Czechia (+1400) and Switzerland (+3500), two teams that could be nuisances to the big dogs in the tournament. Sweden (+500) and Finland (+1000) draw one another while also getting Slovakia (+6500), another team that could prove troublesome if the Finns and Swedes overlook the matchup.\nMaybe there's an argument that it would be better for Team USA to be battle-tested by the time it gets to the knockout stage, but the smaller sheet of ice could mean this tournament is more physical than past Olympics. If that's the case, the Americans likely won't mind fresh legs and bodies.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NFL hiring cycle is as robust as it's been in recent memory. In all, 10 openings popped up across the league this go-around, meaning over 30% of franchises were looking for new head coaches.When we look at the array of openings, they are quite different. On the one hand, teams like the Browns, Giants, Raiders, Titans and Cardinals all fired their head coaches -- some midseason -- after years that left them with some of the league's worst records and in the top 10 of the 2026 NFL Draft. Then, there are clubs like the Bills, Ravens and Steelers that moved on from their head coaches after their tenures -- which were considered successful overall -- ran stale and failed to meet expectations.Now, each of those teams will have new faces leading their organizations into what they all hope will be a brighter tomorrow. With eight coaching positions filled, let's begin rolling out our grades for each hire.Teams yet to hire a head coach: Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Kevin Stefanski: B+The new brain trust in Atlanta, headlined by president of football Matt Ryan and head coach Kevin Stefanski, is quite powerful.\nWith Stefanski, he found himself in a quarterback tornado as head coach of the Browns, particularly over the last few seasons -- beginning with the arrival of Deshaun Watson and double-dipping in last year's draft with Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders.Even with that instability under center, Stefanski was still able to win two NFL Coach of the Year awards (2020 and 2023), so he comes to the Falcons with a strong reputation.Similar to the Browns, however, Stefanski's tenure could be defined by how he develops the quarterback position, particularly with Michael Penix Jr. Unlike Cleveland, Stefanski will now have a plethora of weapons at his disposal to help Penix, most notably Bijan Robinson and Drake London. \nHe also has Kirk Cousins currently in the fold as a veteran backup option. Stefanski was the offensive coordinator for the Vikings in 2019, when Cousins earned a Pro Bowl nod after posting a career-high 107.4 passer rating.From an offensive standpoint, this is a strong attempt by the Falcons brass to maximize what they have in Penix. It was also a savvy move to retain defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich as well.\n        \n            \n                Falcons hire Kevin Stefanski: Former Browns coach takes over in Atlanta in Matt Ryan's first major move\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jesse Minter: AWhile some may have expected Baltimore to go with an offensive-minded head coach to pair with Lamar Jackson, I believe hiring Minter is the better approach.\nOne of the biggest obstacles in the Ravens' pursuit of a Super Bowl berth has been their defense falling short, despite having elite talent like Kyle Hamilton and Roquan Smith. Injuries played a major role, but the unit also simply didn't perform to its level.Minter should help fix that, as his Chargers defense ranked top five in the NFL in several key categories this season as defensive coordinator.Chargers defense in 2025StatsNFL rankTotal YPG285.25thPassing YPG179.95thTD-INT ratio16-191stINT19T-3rdPasser rating75.01stOf course, Minter also has ties to the organization, having worked as a defensive assistant under John Harbaugh from 2017 to 2020. From there, he rose through the ranks largely under Jim Harbaugh — first as his defensive coordinator at Michigan and then with the Chargers.The biggest X-factor will be who Minter brings in as offensive coordinator, but he comes from a strong coaching tree and should be able to find the right conductor for Baltimore's high-octane offense.\n        \n            \n                Ravens hiring Jesse Minter: Chargers defensive coordinator set to replace coach John Harbaugh in Baltimore\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Jeff Hafley: C+When Miami hired former Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan as its next general manager, the writing was on the wall that the Dolphins would keep that Green Bay pipeline flowing with the hiring of Jeff Hafley.This move leans into what made Miami feisty down the stretch, as it went 6-4 over its final 10 games thanks in part to improved defensive play. The Dolphins allowed 21.9 points per game over that span after surrendering 29.3 points per game in the seven games prior. With Hafley's bread and butter on defense, that unit should remain a strength in 2026.Under Hafley, Green Bay allowed 20.5 points per game, 5.1 yards per play and 108.5 rushing yards per game over the last two seasons -- all top-10 marks in the NFL. Hafley's group did stumble a bit down the stretch of the 2025 campaign, however.The bigger concern as Hafley ascends to head coach, despite his experience at the college level (he led Boston College from 2020 to 2023), comes on the offensive side of the ball. Miami appears poised to part ways with Tua Tagovailoa this offseason, and given the team's cap constraints, there's no clear path to a suitable replacement.With Hafley not coming from an offensive background, he may not be able to mask those deficiencies as effectively as a coach with more experience on that side of the ball. That could result in a lean 2026 for the franchise.\n        \n            \n                Tua Tagovailoa benched by Dolphins: Why numbers don't add up now to jettison Miami QB\n                \n                    Joel Corry                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    John Harbaugh: AThis is a great marriage between the Giants and Harbaugh.From New York's perspective, the team needed to bring in a head coach with immediate credibility, particularly after three of its previous four hires were first-time head coaches. The Giants were searching for a Tom Coughlin-like figure who can stabilize the organization, and Harbaugh is certainly capable of that.Harbaugh is also the first head coach the Giants have hired who has previously won a Super Bowl, so he brings a winning pedigree that no recent coach has carried into the building.Giants during/post Tom Coughlin eraDuringSinceSpan2004-152016-25W-L102-9055-109-1Rank15th31stFrom Harbaugh's standpoint, this was the top job on the market when he accepted the gig (Buffalo had not opened up yet). New York already has a franchise quarterback in Jaxson Dart, intriguing skill-position weapons in Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo, and a defensive line stocked with stud pass rushers like Brian Burns, Dexter Lawrence and Abdul Carter.The Giants also hold the fifth overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, creating even more avenues to add blue-chip talent. It wouldn't be surprising to see a Harbaugh-led rebound in 2026.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Robert Saleh: BThere's an argument to be made that the Titans should have opted for an offensive-minded head coach to pair with rising second-year quarterback Cam Ward. After all, the franchise finished 30th in points per game (16.7) and 31st in total yards per game (259.6) during the 2025 season.That said, Saleh is worthy of a second stint as a head coach. While his offenses with the Jets never fully panned out, he did have New York's defense playing at a high level. If he's able to provide a similar boost in Tennessee, that would be a welcome development, particularly after the Titans have given up 27.6 points per game over the last two seasons (31st in the NFL over that span).Saleh was saddled with Zach Wilson to begin his tenure with the Jets, and after that pick flamed out, the team pivoted to Aaron Rodgers, who tore his Achilles just a handful of plays into his first season. That prevented Saleh from ever truly getting off the ground in New York, but he won't have that same problem in Tennessee, particularly if Ward carries over his second-half leap into Year 2.Cam WardFirst 10 gamesLast 7 gamesTeam PPG14.320.1Completion percentage58.4%62.0%Total TD-TO6-1211-2Passer rating73.890.5With his quarterback secure, Saleh will need to hire the right offensive coordinator, but the head coach is positioned to succeed. Beyond already having Ward in place, Saleh inherits a Titans team holding the No. 4 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft and the most available cap space in the NFL, with a projected $100.7 million. That's an awfully strong starting point.\n\n        \n            \n                Robert Saleh rightfully gets a second chance with the Titans, but his OC hire will determine success\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Mike McCarthy: C+It seems clear that the Steelers are not going to be starting over here, having hired a 62-year-old coach to replace the departed 53-year-old Mike Tomlin. They're going to keep trying to win right now, and just do so with more of an offensive bent than what they've had over the last decade or so.And McCarthy is a perfectly cromulent head coach if you want that to be your plan as an organization. His overall coaching resume is actually quite similar to that of John Harbaugh, if you just look at their regular-season and playoff records and the fact that they each won one Super Bowl over a decade ago and have struggled to reach the same playoff heights since then. The difference is that Harbaugh has shown an ability and a willingness to change with the times, and to adjust his schemes (through his coordinator hiring) to fit his personnel, rather than trying to fit square pegs into round holes. The issues that plagued McCarthy during his tenure in Dallas -- stagnant, uncreative offenses and game management, mostly -- were the same as the ones that he ran into toward the end of his time in Green Bay. \nThere's also the question of what will happen if McCarthy doesn't have the same type of quarterback play in Pittsburgh that he did in Green Bay and Dallas with Aaron Rodgers and Dak Prescott. He didn't show the same type of ability to succeed with poor quarterback play that Tomlin showed over the last several years. All in all, this just seems like a rearranging of deck chairs type of hair, rather than the fresh start the Steelers probably needed.\n        \n            \n                Mike McCarthy isn't a sexy Steelers hire, but he's the right fit for a franchise stuck in neutral\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Joe Brady: BThe Bills decided to go with an internal hire following Sean McDermott's firing, promoting offensive coordinator Joe Brady to head coach. Because it's a promotion, it's not exactly the most dynamic hire this cycle, and it will be interesting to see how much of a culture change Brady can actually bring after already being in the building since 2022. \nIt's also curious considering that owner Terry Pegula effectively threw the coaching staff (which includes Brady) under the bus during his press conference after McDermott's firing when asked about the Keon Coleman draft selection. All that said, Brady has been a notable head coaching candidate for the last few years and has been a good offensive play-caller for Buffalo since taking over the role. Most importantly, he has the trust of Josh Allen, and the two already have a rapport that will help this transition, especially if Brady continues to call plays offensively. Is this a home run? No. Overall, it's a pretty lukewarm hire, but we give it a modest \"B\" because of the continuity it provides Allen, who likely gave his stamp of approval on the hire. The next steps will revolve around Brady hiring a capable defensive coordinator and collaborating with GM Brandon Beane to revamp the roster around Allen. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Todd Monken: C-On the one hand, Monken is a great offensive mind who helped Lamar Jackson to an MVP award-winning season in 2023 and back-to-back first-team All-Pro campaigns in 2023 and 2024. Those seasons, Baltimore's offense was arguably the best in the league. While 2025 was more lean for the Ravens, that was due more to injury than any sort of regression on Monken's part. So, we are looking at a coach who can help elevate talent. That said, Cleveland is starved for talent, particularly at quarterback. Given the unclear future at the position with Sheduer Sanders, Dillon Gabriel, and Deshaun Watson currently making up the depth chart, coupled with the salary cap constraints (projected to be $18.6 million over the cap), it was not surprising to see the Browns' job become one of the least desirable this cycle, with various coaching candidates withdrawing from consideration. That makes this hire of Monken feel somewhat like both sides settled. Cleveland couldn't land one of the hotter candidates, and Monken was primarily looking at offensive coordinator jobs, so this may have been his only shot at becoming an NFL head coach. It's hard to see this one having the legs to run for years to come. \n            ",

    "body": "\nThere will be a sense of desperation for both sides when Napoli host Chelsea in a UEFA Champions League matchup on Wednesday at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona in Naples. Napoli, the reigning Serie A champions, face a must-win scenario to finish in the top 24 and advance to the knockout phase playoffs. Meanwhile, Chelsea can't afford to slip up if they are to automatically qualify for the Round of 16. The Italians are 2-2-3 in the league phase and are in 25th place, while the Blues are 4-1-2 and hold the eighth spot in the table on goal differential. The top eight in the Champions League standings advance to the Round of 16, and five other teams are even with Chelsea on points. The Italians played to a 1-1 draw on Jan. 20 with Copenhagen, who played more than a half with 10 men. The Blues got past Cypriot First Division side Pafos 1-0 last week.Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET on Wednesday, and soccer fans can take in all the action on Paramount+. Chelsea are +105 road favorites on the money line (wager $100 to win $105) while Napoli are +250 (wager $100 to win $250) in the latest Napoli vs. Chelsea  odds at DraftKings Sportsbook. A draw is priced at +255 and the Over/Under for total match goals is 2.5 (Over -115, Under -110). Before you make any wagers on Chelsea vs. Napoli, you have to see what SportsLine soccer expert Martin Green is betting for this Champions League match.After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer betting picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), EFL Cup (+4.47), FA Cup (+3.07) and Champions League (+3.05), among others. Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis for Napoli vs. Chelsea on Wednesday, Jan. 28.Napoli vs. Chelsea best betsChelsea Draw No Bet -135 (1 unit)Both Teams to Score and Over 2.5 goals +115 (0.5 units)Napoli will battle for Champions League survival when they host Chelsea at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Wednesday.The Italian champions slipped down to 25th in the Champions League table after drawing 1-1 with Copenhagen in their last game. Only the top 24 teams will qualify for the knockout stage of the competition, so Napoli are on the brink of elimination.They need to beat Chelsea to keep their qualification hopes alive, but that looks like a daunting task. The Blues have won five of six games under new manager Liam Rosenior and look superior to Napoli in most departments.Conte's Champions League struggles continueAntonio Conte became the first manager to win Serie A with three different clubs when he led Napoli to the title last season. He had previously won the Scudetto with Juventus and Inter Milan, so last season's triumph cemented his status as one of the greatest Italian coaches of all time.However, his record in the Champions League is dismal. He has only reached the knockout stage of the competition three times, and he's never taken a team past the quarterfinals.Conte has managed 49 Champions League games, with 17 wins, 16 draws, and 16 defeats. He has led strong teams into the competition -- Inter, Juventus, Napoli, Chelsea and Tottenham -- but they have always underwhelmed.The trend has continued this season as Napoli have picked up just two wins, two draws, and three defeats from seven Champions League matches. They've scored seven goals and conceded 12 times.Their Serie A title defense is also floundering. Napoli slumped to a damaging 3-0 defeat against Juventus on the weekend, which left them fourth in the table.The Neapolitans are now nine points behind Inter, and their chances of winning the Scudetto look slim. Their defense is pretty solid, with just 20 goals conceded in 22 league games, but they aren't scoring enough goals. A long-term injury to playmaker Kevin De Bruyne hasn't helped, while striker Rasmus Højlund is now on a worrying seven-game goal drought.A must-win game for ChelseaChelsea moved up to eighth in the Champions League table after an edgy 1-0 victory over Cypriot minnows Pafos last week. It was far from a vintage performance, but the Blues ultimately got the job done.The top eight teams will qualify automatically for the Round of 16, while the teams that finish ninth through 24th will go into two-leg playoffs. Chelsea will be keen to clinch a top-eight finish but will need to win this game.Seven teams – PSG, Newcastle, Chelsea, Barcelona, Sporting, Man City, Atlético Madrid and Atalanta – are all level on 13 points. Chelsea have the third-best goal difference out of those teams, so they're eighth in the table, but they could fall out of the top eight if a team like Barcelona or Man City earns a heavy victory.The onus will be on Chelsea to win this game by a comfortable margin – and that looks like an achievable goal. Chelsea eased to a 3-1 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday and are full of confidence right now.They have a large squad, so Rosenior can shuffle his pack for this game, meaning the players should be pretty fresh.There seems to be a gulf in quality between the Premier League and Serie A right now. Scott McTominay was a pretty average midfielder at Man United but was named Serie A Player of the Year last season at Napoli. That gulf in quality could be evident in this game.It won't be easy for Chelsea, as they have a young squad and are playing away from home in a hostile venue, but their superior quality could ultimately give them an edge.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If the New York Knicks wants to compete for a championship, their defense has to be better. It really is that simple. Now, the hard part is figuring out how to make the defense better with two bad defensive players (Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns) serving as the core of a top-three offense while sharing the court for over 60% of each other's minutes. Towns takes a lot of the heat. Keep what I'm about to say in perspective as the Knicks are still four points better offensively with Towns -- a borderline All-Star averaging north of 20 points and 11 rebounds per game -- on the floor, but on top of his poor defense and often-foolish fouling, he's having the worst shooting season of his career. For these reasons, Towns' name has been picking up some trade rumor traction ahead of next Thursday's deadline. The Knicks and Giannis Antetokounmpo clearly have eyes for each other, and if that deal were to go down, Towns would almost certainly be part of it. But earlier this week, veteran NBA reporter Marc Stein said that there is a \"persistent belief\" among rival teams that Towns could also be available in non-Giannis trades. But even if Towns were to be dealt, the Knicks would still have a Brunson problem on defense. \nYes, we're all aware of Brunson's unimpeachable offensive value. He's about as good as it gets. But in today's NBA, the net value of even the most elite offensive points guards is being called into major question if the tradeoff is defensive ineptitude. Look at Trae Young. He's one of the best offensive players on earth, and he just got salary dumped to the Wizards. The Bucks are paying Damian Lillard $113 million over the next five seasons to play for someone else. Nobody wants Ja Morant. The Mavericks traded Luka Dončić for crying out loud. The Knicks are not going to trade Brunson, and this is not a suggestion that they should even consider that, but there is a reason Stein also reported that New York has \"explored pathways\" to acquire Jrue Holiday. It would be a perfect match. Holiday isn't just the prototype for the get-over-the-hump player; he's the actual player who has gotten two teams, the Bucks and Celtics, over the championship hump. \nThe Knicks have to go up a level if they want to contend, and they have to cover for Brunson defensively. Again, Towns feels like he takes more heat for his defense, at least nationally, but the data says the Knicks are actually significantly more handicapped by Brunson. Just look at the numbers, per Databallr.LINEUPSDEFENSIVE RATINGTowns without Brunson112.1Brunson without Towns120.0All told, the Knicks are +8.7 with Towns and no Brunson and +3.3 with Brunson and no Towns. Of course, the real problem is both of these guys together. It's likely too high a hurdle to clear if we're going to have a realistic conversation about title contention.The Knicks heeded Boston's championship blueprint by loading up on two-way wings in Mikal Bridges, OG Anunoby and Josh Hart, and adding their stretch five with Towns in the role of Al Horford/Kristaps Porziņģis, providing space for an elite scorer (Brunson/Jayson Tatum) to exploit. Adding Holiday would damn near be a copy-and-paste job. The glaring difference, of course, is those Celtics didn't have any defensive holes. Holiday remains a great defender. But the Knicks have a lot of good defenders right now, and they're still tripping over the Brunson hurdle.If the Knicks somehow swung deals for Giannis and Holiday, now we'd be talking something serious. But for now, let's stay away from the pipe dreams and focus on one question: Can the Knicks win a title with a small, defensively deficient point guard as their best player? A lot of teams have been asking themselves that question, and they're pretty much all coming to the same conclusion. Unless your name is Stephen Curry (who actually isn't a bad defender, to be fair), it's probably not happening. The Knicks are going to try to prove otherwise, but the Brunson honeymoon can only last for so long. For a minute, Knicks fans were so happy just to be relevant that Brunson could do no wrong. But now that the conference finals box has been checked and a Finals berth, at minimum, has become the expectation (so stated by the owner), Brunson either has to be better or the Knicks have to be better at covering for him, whether Towns ends up getting traded or not.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Novak Djokovic is two wins away from a historic 25th grand slam following Tuesday night's \"lucky\" win over Lorenzo Musetti, 4-6, 3-6, 3-1 (ret.) at the Australian Open. Down two sets and up a break in the third, Djokovic appeared stunned after a leg injury forced Musetti to retire.Djokovic will play second-seeded Jannik Sinner in one semifinal while No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz battles Alexander Zverev in the other on the men's side.\"I don't know what to say except that I feel really sorry for him. He was the far better player. I was on my way home tonight,\" Djokovic, a 10-time Australian Open champion, said after the match. \"I don't know what to say, these kind of things happen in sport, and it happened to me a few times, but being in the quarters of a Grand Slam and two sets to love up, and being in full control, I mean it's so unfortunate. \"I don't know what else I can say. I really wish him a speedy recovery. He should have been a winner today, no doubt.\"\nMusetti had lost six straight matches to Djokovic before dominating the first two sets, breaking his opponent's first serve game while benefitting from 31 unforced errors.\"I had like four winners in the first two games and no unforced errors, and then the rest of the match I had another four winners and probably 40 errors,\" Djokovic said. \"That's what Lorenzo does to you. He makes you play, and when you think the point is finished, it's not. Obviously a little bit more wind today, swirly conditions, and when you attack him, you don't know what to expect, whether it's going to be a crosscourt passing shot, or short slice, or he's going to go full flat in your body or just a looping ball to my weakest shot, which is my overhead, which I think we've seen today again.\"Sinner cruises against Ben SheltonThe last remaining American on the men's side, Shelton went down to Sinner's big serve and razor-sharp consistency, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. After previously losing only one set in the tournament, eight-seeded Shelton couldn't find an answer for Sinner's crosscourt expertise and relentless power.\nSinner went at Shelton's backhand throughout the match and improved to 9-1 against the hard-hitting American. He managed 18 winners and only four unforced errors in the final set. Sinner is a two-time defending Australian Open champion.\"It is very tough to play against Ben,\" Sinner said. \"He has a huge, huge serve and I feel like he is improving so much, year after year. Especially after the offseason, you don't know how certain players are going to play against you and change lots of things. I am very happy with today's performance.\"Earlier in the tournament, Sinner took advantage of a heat-related timeout to topple American Eliot Spizzirri in the third round. Up a break at 3-1 in the third inside Rod Laver Arena after splitting the first two sets, Spizzirri was in disbelief with Sinner reeling from cramps after tournament officials briefly suspended play due to excessive heat. \nJessica Pegula handles Amanda AnisimovaSixth-seeded Pegula has not dropped a set at the Australian Open. She finished off No. 4 Anisimova with a dominant showing in a second-set tiebreak to win in straights, 6-2, 7-6. A finalist at the 2024 US Open, Pegula is into the Australian Open semifinals for the first time in her career and will face Elena Rybakina later this week.Pegula beat American Madison Keys, the tournament's defending champion, in the fourth round to face off with Anisimova. Pegula dominated the first set, then turned up the heat late to finish off an opponent who didn't bring her best and was marred by a litany of unforced errors.\"I felt like I could win the rallies and I could put pressure on her serves,\" Pegula said. \"I just told myself to gear right back up. You've got to win the tiebreak unless you want to go to a third set and I really didn't want to.\"\nIn the other women's semifinal, top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka takes on Elena Svitolina. Sabalenka hasn't dropped a set in the tournament and barely broke a sweat during a quarterfinal win over American Iva Jovic, 6-3, 6-0.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If you've ever tried to get a ticket to the Super Bowl, you may have noticed that it's pretty much impossible unless you're willing to fork over thousands of dollars on the secondary market. The CHEAPEST ticket for Super Bowl LX is currently sitting at about $6,400 on the secondary market, and that's just to get yourself into the game. If you want to go with a friend or a family member, you'll need to go ahead and tack on another $6,400 per person. The average ticket price for Super Bowl LX is currently sitting at about $8,004, according to Tick Pick.The cheapest way to get into the game is to get your hands on a ticket that costs face value. For Super Bowl LX, the prices range from $950 to $8,500. That's still a lot of money, but going to a Super Bowl for $950 doesn't sting as much as handing over $6,000 for a ticket on the secondary market.  The problem is that getting a ticket at face value is almost impossible. The reason tickets are so hard to get is because the Super Bowl is the one game where the NFL accounts for every single ticket. There are no tickets sold to the general public. The league distributes tickets to all 32 teams and then keeps a cut for itself.  \nFor this year's game, the Seahawks and Patriots will each get 17.5% of the tickets -- or 35% of the total. This year, that means each team will get about 12,450 tickets since Levi's Stadium will have a capacity of roughly 71,100 for the game.  The tickets distributed to the Seahawks and Patriots will go to players, front office members and even some season-ticket holders, who will all pay face value. Although each team will be getting roughly 12,450 tickets to the game this year, most of those don't end up in the hands of fans, because each team generally uses of a large portion of its tickets. Each player on the roster is given two complimentary tickets and then has the option to buy up to 13 more at face value, which means each player has access to up to 15 tickets. If all 53 players use up their allotment, that's 795 tickets out of circulation, and you still have to give tickets to the coaching staff, front office and other team employees. Most teams also make several hundred tickets available to their former players. \nThat being said, the NFL does require that each team set aside at least 35% of its allotment for fans, so the Patriots and Seahawks will each be handing out at least 4,350 tickets to their season-ticket holders (Most teams hold a lottery and the fans that win have the option to buy tickets at face value).  \nAs for the rest of the Super Bowl tickets, the 30 teams that aren't playing in the game also get their cut. The host team gets the biggest allotment at 5% (That's 3,550 tickets this year), which means the 49ers might have some extra tickets. The NFL actually requires the host team to set aside 10% of its allotment for fans, so that's an extra 355 tickets that go to fans. The other 29 teams then each get a 1.2% share of the tickets (That's 850 tickets per team this year). The 29 teams are encouraged to hand out 10% of their allotment to their fans, but it's not a requirement. If you're scoring at home, that means that fans will only have a chance to buy about 11,520 tickets at face value (Although that number can go higher if teams offer more than 10% of their allotment to fans). \nThe rest of the Super Bowl tickets go to the NFL with league in control of 25.2% of the total allotment, which will be about 17,900 tickets this year. Of that total, 2,500 will be used by the league office and then the NFL generally gives about 750 tickets to the Super Bowl Host Committee. Of the remaining tickets, a large number goes to On Location Experiences, which is the NFL's official hospitality provider. The league generally let's that company handle roughly 10,000 tickets.  Here's the full percentage breakdown for where the tickets go:  League office: 25.2% of ticketsSeahawks: 17.5% to participating teamPatriots: 17.5% to participating team49ers: 5% to host team29 other teams: 1.2% each (34.8%)If you get your hands on a ticket at face value, consider yourself lucky, because there are plenty of people who paid an arm and a leg to be there.  \n            ",

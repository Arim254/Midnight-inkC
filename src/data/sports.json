    "body": "\n        NFL DFS players will have their final multi-game slate of the year as Championship Sunday brings both the AFC Championship Game and the NFC Championship Game. The Broncos and Patriots play at 3 p.m. ET, followed by Seahawks vs. Rams at 6:30 p.m. ET. Injuries will play a big part in both matchups with Bo Nix (ankle) out for Denver and Zach Charbonnet (ACL) out for Seattle. Denver, especially, will have a new look on offense and daily Fantasy football players will have to craft a strategy around how to value backup Jarrett Stidham and the rest of the that offense without Nix. The latter's absence could affect the likes of Courtland Sutton, Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant.Who are the best NFL DFS picks for Sunday, and which sleepers can differentiate your NFL DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel?

    "body": "\n        American soccer's most electrifying superstar finally has a new club contract and is staying put. U.S. women's national team winger Trinity Rodman signed a three-year contract extension with the Washington Spirit, the club announced on Thursday. Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang and club president Haley Carter made the special announcement at a media event in Los Angeles on Thursday. Rodman's salary will be over $1 million per season, making her the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world, according to ESPN.\"I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,\" said Rodman in a press release. \"I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.\"     The 23-year-old Rodman spent several weeks in contract limbo following the 2025 NWSL Championship in November. Her previous contract with the Spirit was through the 2025 season, and as the offseason kicked into full gear, attention and interest in her playing future hit warp speed. What began as standard contract negotiations eventually escalated into crisis mode for the NWSL.Here's what to know:An ending to unprecedented contract negotiationsRodman's new contract brings an ongoing back-and-forth of negotiations to an end. She burst onto the pro athlete hemisphere with an impressive rookie season in 2021, where she won NWSL Rookie of the Year honors and the 2021 NWSL Championship. Her fearless efforts in taking on defenders, unselfish assists, and a signature \"trin-spin\" move are all things that highlight her athleticism.\nHer unique style, appreciation for American chain restaurants, and endearing TikToks are just some of the other traits that take her from pro soccer player to celebrity for others. After winning an Olympic gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, her profile reached beyond the international stage and into casual tournament viewership. It's a win for the player who ultimately wanted to stay in the United States and play in the league that she helped carry into its next decade. For the NWSL, it means the league avoids another blow to its ability to retain star players and maintains its competitive appeal. \n        \n            \n                Trinity Rodman's contract saga timeline: NWSL reportedly approves changes in an effort to keep star?\n                \n                    Sandra Herrera                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRocky road between league and RodmanThe pathway to a new contract presented a balancing act for the league between its signature parity and the urgent need to ensure its marquee players are compensated as global transfer fees for players rise at a rapid pace. At one point in negotiations, Rodman and the Spirit did agree to a contract, a four-year deal reportedly worth a record-setting amount valued at over $1 million a year, but the deal was vetoed by NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman.  \nThe commissioner rejected the contract for allegedly violating the spirit of the league rules due to its backloaded structure. In response, the NWSL Players Association filed a formal grievance on Dec. 3, arguing that the veto was a \"flagrant violation\" of Rodman's free agency rights under the collective bargaining agreement. The added layer of legal challenges created a stalemate in the new year. Spotlight on the NWSL centered on the salary cap, a financial system that the league credits as the central component to its parity, as Rodman remained unsigned to any club following Berman's veto of the previous deal. Out of the discourse, the league board voted to implement a new financial mechanism known as the High-Impact Player-rule. The HIP rule allows teams to utilize extra funds beyond the salary cap for players who meet specific \"star\" player criteria, which raised questions about which players were considered stars to the league. The newly created mechanism in December offered no immediate resolution to the contract pendulum, and though it was referred to as the \"Rodman Rule,\" Denver Summer FC indicated that Lindsey Heaps could be the first player signed with the HIP funds as the NWSLPA filed an additional grievance following its passage.  \nThe players' union is challenging the rule. The NWSLPA is seeking immediate rescission of the rule, claiming \"a player compensation rule implemented without bargaining and in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and federal labor law.\"A lightning rod of optimismDespite the initial roadblock in the rotating contract cycle between player, club, and the league, the finality of Rodman's contract means looking ahead. For Rodman, navigating the highs and lows of managing injuries through her career, her resume to date shows she can not only produce, but can also come back and produce some more. Rodman's decision to stick through negotiations with the league of her choice carries a symbolic weight for the future of the league's identity. Her staying proves crucial as she's the best example of an NWSL product and its potential -- a current star who is shaping the league and national team for the present and the future.\nAs she steps into the next era as a Washington Spirit player, Rodman wants to shape this next phase of her career a little differently, with an emphasis on community.\"I think my next steps with Spirit are just tapping more into community and youth,\" Rodman told CBS Sports during the contract announcement event. \"I think I [already] do that through games and TikToks and all the funny stuff. But I think just being more involved moving forward, I do want to be involved with youth that are less fortunate, because I know, even just speaking from experience, I was not financially stable growing up. So it's very difficult for those [who] are naturally gifted, or even not naturally gifted, to have the ability to play sports and get to where I'm at, because again, it's a dream, and I think everyone should have that opportunity. So I think that would be my first thing, because kids are kind of everything to me, and I once was that little kid that wanted this, and now I'm here, so I want to take advantage of everything that I can do.\"\nWhat's next?Trinity Rodman is currently in the USWNT January training camp as the national team prepare for a pair of upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Chile. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The biggest lingering question of the NWSL offseason has officially been answered – Trinity Rodman will return to the league after signing a new deal with the Washington Spirit through 2028, a decision made official with an announcement on Thursday, ensuring that the league's biggest star will stay put for the foreseeable future. Rodman's salary will be over $1 million per season and makes her the highest-paid women's soccer player in the world, according to ESPN.Thursday's announcement ended a months-long saga over Rodman's signature, an ordeal that included interest from other clubs in the U.S. and England. The Spirit were intent to re-sign her, though, doing so despite friction with the league over the structure of a new deal, one that resulted in the NWSL Players Association filing a grievance that has yet to be resolved. The NWSL's introduction of their new high-impact player rule, which officially kicks off in July pending a separate grievance from the NWSLPA, paved the way for the Spirit and Rodman to finally agree to terms the league was satisfied with.\"I've made the DMV my home and the Spirit my family, and I knew this was where I wanted to enter the next chapter of my career,\" said Rodman in a press release. \"I'm proud of what we've built since my rookie season, and I'm excited about where this club is headed. We're chasing championships and raising the standard, and I can't wait to keep doing that with my teammates and the best fans in the NWSL.\"   The end of a months-long back-and-forth is good news for all parties involved, chief among them Rodman ahead of an important couple of years with the U.S. women's national team leading up to the 2027 Women's World Cup. Many may point to this moment in the future as an important step in the NWSL's evolution amidst the skyrocketing growth of the women's game around the world, too. Rodman's NWSL return, though, is just one layer in a multi-dimensional topic that remains the single most important issue in an evolving sport.\nHere's what Rodman's new deal means for the NWSL, and perhaps the sport as a whole.\n        \n            \n                Trinity Rodman signs new deal with Washington Spirit as NWSL manages to keep USWNT superstar\n                \n                    Sandra Herrera                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNWSL can capitalize on Rodman's star powerThere is a reason commissioner Jessica Berman said the NWSL \"will fight\" to keep Rodman around in her remarks before last year's championship – she is easily the league's biggest star.The NWSL's entire brand hinges on its star power, something the league has always boasted even in times of financial hardship and when the league had a lower profile. The competitive on-field product has always been the league's greatest selling point, and technically would still be without Rodman. The USWNT talent, though, matches her immense skill with a spotlight that makes her marketable for both the Spirit and the NWSL as a whole. She is undeniably a valuable piece of the puzzle that has allowed the Spirit to emerge a popular sports team in Washington, D.C., boasting two sellouts at Audi Field in their run to the 2025 Championship.\nFor Rodman and the NWSL, the good news is that hers is not the only big name they can build their brand around. Rodman, alongside the likes of the Portland Thorns' Sophia Wilson and the Chicago Stars' Mallory Swanson, can be the anchors for a group of rising stars as the NWSL continues a period of transition after a previous generation of high-profile talent like Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe retired. That is especially true with a few busy years ahead in the sport – the 2026 men's World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S., will afford all of American soccer an increased spotlight, while the 2027 Women's World Cup in Brazil and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles could offer a boost to the NWSL.HIP rule works – for nowWith the salary cap set at $3.3 million per team for the 2026 season, it was clear that the NWSL needed to do something to ensure its teams could compete with an ambitious European team unburdened by such wage restrictions. They managed to do so with the high impact player rule, which did the job in ensuring Rodman returned to the Spirit before preseason officially began. It is a flawed rule, though, and its best-case usage scenario may simply be as a stopgap until the NWSL comes up with a solution that feels more current.Special rules for special players are not inherently uncommon – see MLS' designated player rule – but the HIP rule is different in the sense that teams have only a limited amount of funds to work with and a limited pool of players to choose from. Teams will be allowed to use an additional $1 million on contracts for players who qualify through a number of criteria like USWNT playing time, but somewhat more arbitrary classifications like awards recognition and inclusion in media lists make the HIP rule an unusual one. A fairly wide net has been cast as the rule currently stands, but when the Orlando Pride's Lizbeth Ovalle would not qualify despite fetching the record transfer fee in her $1.5 million move from Tigres last summer, it raises a few questions about the rule's language.\nThe HIP rule is also the subject of a new grievance filed by the NWSLPA earlier this month, with the union arguing it violates both the collective bargaining agreement and federal labor law, which could impact the rule's implementation in the long run. Even if the HIP rule remains as is, though, the annual increases the league promised will be an important topic of focus. The salary cap will rise to $5.1 million in the 2030 season, per the CBA, though whether or not that type of money is enough to contend with rising transfer fees and salaries in the women's game is an open question.The tug-of-war with Europe continuesThe Spirit may have seemed like the likeliest destination for Rodman this winter, though the pull of Europe may not permanently fade. Rodman said in an interview with ESPN last year that she would \"kick herself if I retired\" without playing overseas, a sentiment that continues to be shared by different USWNT players. Sam Coffey is the latest example, recently joining Manchester City after years with the Portland Thorns in part because she wanted to experience the game elsewhere.It is a sign of health for the women's game that players have choice, something that is especially true for top-end players like Rodman and Coffey. Many will inevitably choose to play overseas for a time if only for the experience of living somewhere else, something many USWNT players like Morgan and Rapinoe did before them. The sport is in a fascinating spot right now, though – some may feel that NWSL teams spend conservatively, either by choice or by force through the league's rules, but there are currently only a handful of teams in Europe willing to compete with them for star players. It likely means that for the time being, a small selection of clubs in the U.S. and Europe will do their best to hoard many of the world's best players, and may split the pool of talent somewhat evenly in the process.\nThe great unknown for the NWSL, and the sport as a whole, is when the other rich teams in Europe will wake up to the reality that the women's game is worth investing in. There are several clubs that have racked up accolades in the men's game like Real Madrid and Bayern Munich who have yet to unlock their full financial might in the women's game, but the reality is that teams that feel like a tier below the elites can flip a switch and heavyweights of women's soccer. If more and more clubs in Europe realize that, it may be bad news for the NWSL – unless the U.S. league is prepared to maintain its status as a leader of the sport.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. So far nine NFL teams have fired their coaches and one, Mike Tomlin, has stepped down. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris right after their season ended. And on Black Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons. Then the Miami Dolphins fired Mike McDaniel. Tomlin stepped down from his post as the Pittsburgh Steelers head coach after 19 seasons last week. Following a playoff loss to the Broncos in the divisional round, the Buffalo Bills entered the coaching hunt after firing Sean McDermott. In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    1. BillsThe Buffalo Bills have arguably the best player in the league at the most important position in the sport in Josh Allen. That alone makes this the most coveted job of this cycle, after the Bills fired Sean McDermott after their latest playoff loss to the Denver Broncos. Pairing yourself next to Allen has championship potential, so every head coach who hasn't already accepted a job will almost certainly stop what they're doing and see if they can align themselves with Allen. \nOutside of the elite QB, Buffalo does have other things going for it. James Cook is coming off a 2025 regular season where he led the NFL in rushing, the defense allowed a league-low 156.9 passing yards per game, and they are just about to move into a brand new stadium. That said, whoever is hired will need to help improve a horrid run defense and get the most out of a lacking pass-catching group to truly help Allen get over the hump in the postseason. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    2. RaidersThe Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players. There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.\nOne drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    3. SteelersThe Pittsburgh Steelers have a patient ownership group under the Rooney family: they've only had three head coaches since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger. Their defense remains stout led by All-Pro edge rusher T.J. Watt with the Steelers generating three takeaways -- an interception and two fumbles recoveries -- off of Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud in an eventual defeat thanks to their crumbling offense around Aaron Rodgers. This is an organization headed for a rebuild after five consecutive seasons with 9 or 10 wins with four of those years ending with wild card round defeats. \nPittsburgh does have $23.6 million in effective cap space according to OverTheCap.com, but this offseason doesn't have a great free agency quarterback class, notable considering the Steelers haven't had a long-term quarterback since Ben Roethlisberger's retirement after the 2021 season. The best options are Daniel Jones coming off of a torn Achiles, Rodgers entering his age-43 season or Green Bay Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis who shined in relief of Jordan Love the last two seasons. On the trade market, Kyler Murray is likely the best choice. Whoever takes this job will be tasked with helping the Steelers build around that elusive franchise quarterback, rebuild a stale offense and manage what's becoming a quickly aging defense.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    4. BrownsThe Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade. What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.\nThe Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    5. CardinalsArizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall. Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues. \nThey do have players like Trey McBride, Michael Wilson, Paris Johnson Jr., Josh Sweat, Budda Baker, Garrett Williams, Walter Nolen and Will Johnson, but there are still a lot of holes here and not that much to build around.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The calendar may have turned to a new year, but Scottie Scheffler is picking up right where he left off. Unable to play in last season's American Express due to a hand injury he suffered towards the end of the offseason, the world No. 1 returned to Palm Springs, California, looking to start his season without a hitch. And that he did.Scheffler opened with a 9-under 63 at La Quinta Country Club, positioning himself one stroke behind Min Woo Lee and Pierceson Coody, both of whom fired 10-under 62s at the Nicklaus Tournament Course. Scheffler's 63 represents the lowest score he has ever carded at the American Express as he looks for his first tournament title in his sixth appearance.\"You have to approach it mentally like you have to make some birdies, and I think putting yourself in position as many times as you can in order to get some looks and hole some putts, I think, is most important,\" Scheffler said. \"I think if you start forcing things, you can still get in some trouble. It's still golf, it's still quite difficult, believe it or not, even though the scores are low. You just have to keep putting yourself in position and give yourself opportunities.\"The season could not have started on a better foot for the four-time PGA Tour Player of the Year. Making birdie on his first two holes, Scheffler's par on No. 3 was a rarity on his front nine as he penciled three more circles onto his scorecard from Nos. 4-6. In his first nine holes, Scheffler had more 3s (six) than 4s (three) and turned in 30.\nScheffler continued to pepper the center of the club face on his back side as his driver misbehaved ever so slightly. Missing on the correct side, he was able to hit every green in regulation up until the par-4 17th, where -- in typical Scheffler fashion -- he chipped in for birdie.\n\"You got to keep pace out here,\" Scheffler said. \"I think the hardest part about these tests, where you have to shoot so low, is you can only shoot so many under par in a round of golf. I think, when you look at the harder tests, there's always a couple guys each round that are able to shoot something really low. The easier tests, where the scores are crazy low, if you start falling behind, it's a lot harder to keep up, so you have to keep pace out here.\"Scheffler on Friday heads to the Nicklaus Tournament Course where the bulk of the names on the leaderboard played on Thursday. While La Quinta Country Club and the Nicklaus Tournament Course yielded respective scoring averages south of 4 under and 5 under, the Stadium Course brought the brunt of the difficulty for players. \nJason Day proved to be the one up for the challenge in Round 1 as the Australian signed for a 9-under 63 on the Stadium Course and leads the field from a strokes-gained perspective with two days of birdie-making opportunities ahead of him.LeadersT1. Min Woo Lee, Pierceson Coody (-10): After winning in Houston last season, Lee hit a bit of a lull but came out of it towards the end of 2025 with a return to Australia producing some fine results. His play back home carried over to the first round of the year as the electric Australian made 10 birdies against no dropped shots on Thursday. Lee credited a small tweak for the early success as he made his left hand slightly stronger in his grip during the offseason.\"There was a little bit of anxiousness starting out,\" Lee said. \"The first round of the year, bit of a swing, not change, but something that we've been working on in the off-season. So you didn't really know how it was going to go. But, yeah, started off really nice. Yeah, kept it going. It was a great day to make some birdies. Probably the still he's day I've ever played golf in. So the numbers were exactly, you know, what you wanted and you just execute 'em. But it was a really fun day.\"\nContendersT3. Scottie Scheffler, Robert MacIntyre, Si Woo Kim, S.H. Lee, Vince Whaley, Matt McCarty, Ben Griffin, Jason Day, Patrick Cantlay (-9)T12. Billy Horschel, Sam Stevens, Jordan Smith, Matthieu Pavon, Andrew Novak, Tom Hoge, Eric Cole, Jacob Bridgeman (-8)MacIntyre was none too pleased about his play midway through last week's Sony Open as he snapped his putter over his knee and charged into the weekend with a new attitude. Firing the low round of the day on Sunday, the left hander noted that his wedge play had finally started to cooperate (along with the new putter, of course). On Thursday at the Nicklaus Tournament course, he had those same clubs dialed in leading to 10 birdies on his scorecard and just one dropped shot which came on the par-5 15th.\"I've tried to put on a bit of speed,\" MacIntyre said. \"Try to hit a bit longer off the tee. Not much. It was like six yards I was trying to gain. I think I've done that. But then other than that it was wedge play, really had to dial in the wedge play. I wasn't hitting it close enough with a wedge. When I'm a good putter, the closer you are the better. It's like anyone, the closer you are to the hole, the better chance you've got. So, no, the last two weeks have been, well today and last week, have been really good with the wedges and, yeah, it's good signs.\"\nNo rest for the wearyWhen is the last time you played golf eight days in a row? Now, when is the last time you played eight days of competitive golf in a row? Fresh off a top-20 finish in the Bahamas on the Korn Ferry Tour, Blades Brown is in the middle of such a run as he hopped on a private jet — which he received points for via his top-20 finish in Myrtle Beach last year — to catch his tee time in Palm Springs.Brown opened with a bogey-free 67 at La Quinta Country Club in what can only be described as polar opposite conditions as winds were whipping in the Bahamas all week and not a breath could be found Thursday at the American Express.\"Finished the round. Had to quickly take a shower and then drove to the airport. Then hopped on a massive ONEflight jet,\" Brown said. \"Ferren Rajput, he was kind of enough to escort me on the way here. It was a six-hour flight. I think it was his jet, so it was awesome. My second time ever flying private. It was beautiful. \n\"Then, yeah, arrived here around 8:00 p.m. last night. Got some Panda Express. Got some groceries. Slept, started sleeping at 10:00. Then woke up at around 5:00, got here a little early to make a couple putts, because, I mean, it was blowing 30 the entire way, and then you get here and then it's perfect. So it's two completely different situations. But I had a lot of fun today, and bogey-free round, I'll take that any day of the week.\"2025 American Express updated odds, picksOdds via DraftKings SportsbookScottie Scheffler: +185Jason Day: +1000Ben Griffin: +1100Robert MacIntyre: +1400Patrick Cantlay: +1600Min Woo Lee: +1700Si Woo Kim: +1800Pierceson Coody: +2000This tournament is still wide open despite Scheffler's score and Day blitzing the Stadium Course. I'm still a believer in Cantlay and McCarty, both of whom had great first rounds. If there was a player to add, it may be Kim, a previous tournament winner who sounds rejuvenated with his putter after a poor performance in Hawaii and may be striking the ball as crisply as anyone not named Scheffler.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        This offseason's coaching carousel is one of the wildest in recent memory.Not only did two head-coaching jobs open during the season, but EIGHT more have become available since the end of the regular season, including two from teams that made the playoffs. The 10 total available head-coaching jobs -- Giants, Falcons, Cardinals, Bills, Dolphins, Browns, Ravens, Steelers, Titans and Raiders -- tie the record for most in a given offseason. One job that remains open belongs to a teams with a past regular-season MVP, and one belongs to a franchise with arguably the most job stability in league history. There were -- and still are -- plenty of coordinator openings on both sides of the ball, and more could open depending on what happens with the remaining head-coaching slots.With that in mind, it's important to take stock of what has happened to date during the hiring cycle. We compiled a quick list of early winners and losers and will keep it updated as more openings get filled.Winner: New York GiantsThe Giants acted quickly and aggressively to land the top available coach of this hiring cycle, finalizing a five-year deal with former Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh before he could take planned meetings with the Tennessee Titans and Atlanta Falcons. \nAs we wrote last week, Harbaugh should bring immediate stability and competence to a Giants organization that has desperately needed both for at least the past decade, cycling through coach after coach and disappointment after disappointment. Harbaugh should also bring over a strong staff of assistant coaches, and the Giants will be better for having hired him.\n        \n            \n                John Harbaugh's first 100 days: The blueprint to rebuild the Giants\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Buffalo BillsThe Bills' decision to fire Sean McDermott in the wake of their divisional-round loss to the Denver Broncos is somewhat understandable. It has been nine years of the McDermott era and seven of McDermott and Josh Allen, and they have yet to achieve their Super Bowl goals. McDermott might not have been the issue standing in Buffalo's way, but teams can only make changes in so many ways, and swapping out the coach is one of them.The Bills land here less because of the firing itself and more because they elevated Brandon Beane to an even more powerful role despite his presiding over a roster that has backslid over the past several years, then followed it with a disastrous press conference from Beane and owner Terry Pegula explaining both the firing and the promotion. \nAdd in the fact that this is not an ideal hiring cycle in which to search for McDermott's replacement, and the Bills land here with relative ease.\n        \n            \n                Bills owner Terry Pegula throws Keon Coleman under the bus, claims coaching staff pushed to pick wide receiver\n                \n                    Robby Kalland                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWinner (and Loser): Los Angeles ChargersWhatever one thinks of Mike McDaniel's head-coaching bona fides, there is no arguing that he can dial up an offense. He is one of the best in the NFL at putting players in position to succeed, specifically by getting playmakers the ball in space so they can make things happen after the catch. He also excels at designing a run game. The Chargers have struggled to run the ball for a while, and McDaniel should be able to alleviate that. McDaniel has done all of this over the past few years with a quarterback -- Tua Tagovailoa -- who has clear limitations, yet McDaniel schemed around them. Expected to be hired as the Chargers' offensive coordinator, McDaniel can build an offense around a quarterback with significantly more physical talent. The marriage between McDaniel and head coach Jim Harbaugh may be an odd one personality-wise, but from a football-fit standpoint, it's hard to believe the Chargers could have done a better job finding their next OC.\nThe Chargers are also a loser this cycle, though, because they will no longer have defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, who will become the next coach of the Baltimore Ravens. (See below.)Loser: Cleveland Browns (so far)Cleveland is still in its second round of interviews, with coaches such as Todd Monken and Jim Schwartz already getting their turns and others like Jesse Minter, Grant Udinski and Nate Scheelhaase reportedly in the mix. There is still a chance the Browns can land the plane here, and this designation could change if they make a home-run hire. (We'll switch them from loser to winner if and when they do.) For now, though, they belong here. Cleveland fired Kevin Stefanski, and he immediately landed another -- and probably more desirable -- job as the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons. The aforementioned McDaniel pulled his name out of consideration for the Browns' top job before deciding to become an offensive coordinator instead. Meanwhile, more jobs keep opening and pushing this one further down the pecking order.\nWinner: Tennessee Titans (kind of)The Titans hired former San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator and New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh as their next coach. Perhaps just as importantly, they did not hire now two-time former Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy, which had been heavily rumored before the Saleh news broke, given the connection between Nagy and Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi from their time in Kansas City. Nagy showed little propensity for putting players in position to succeed during his tenure as head coach of the Chicago Bears, and the Chiefs' offense backslid significantly upon his return to his previous role, so it never made much sense that he was considered the favorite to land this job.Saleh's time in New York did not go particularly well, but that stemmed almost entirely from the revolving-door situation at quarterback. His defense ranked as the best in the league during that stretch. If the Titans are right about Cam Ward, things could be different this time around.\n\n        \n            \n                Robert Saleh rightfully gets a second chance with the Titans, but his OC hire will determine success\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLoser: Miami DolphinsThe Dolphins fired McDaniel, and he immediately became the top candidate for nearly every offensive coordinator opening while also interviewing for multiple head-coaching jobs. In the wake of his firing, the rumor mill kicked into high gear that Miami wanted to pursue Harbaugh, but he showed more interest in other opportunities.The Dolphins ultimately hired the Green Bay Packers tandem of Jon-Eric Sullivan and Jeff Hafley as their general manager and head coach, respectively. Hafley went 22-26 in four seasons as the head coach at Boston College before becoming Green Bay's defensive coordinator, where his defenses played very well early in the season before slipping down the stretch. He is a well-respected defensive mind, but it's fair to question whether this was the most inspiring hire in the grand scheme of things.Winner: Baltimore RavensBaltimore moved on from Harbaugh to kick off its offseason, but rebounded from that by making what seems like the most sensible hire the Ravens could have made in Jesse Minter. Minter was with the Ravens as as a defensive assistant and then defensive backs coach for four years (2017 through 2020) before moving to the college ranks at Vanderbilt and then Michigan, where he worked as Jim Harbaugh's defensive coordinator before making the jump to the NFL and handling the same role with the Chargers. \nHis defense over the last couple of seasons has been very good, and he's shown that he's able to build quality units despite not having elite talent. At the very least, he should get the Ravens closer to playing the kind of defense they did under Mike Macdonald. A lot will obviously depend on his offensive coordinator hire -- and there are already rumors of Kliff Kingsbury -- but this hire itself is a good one.Winner: Dallas CowboysDallas moved on from former defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus, whose unit was arguably the worst in the league this season. Eberflus was thrust upon head coach Brian Schottenheimer by the Jones family, and while he was dealt a bad hand with the trade of Micah Parsons just before the start of the season, he also played that hand badly and things were a disaster on that side of the ball to the point that a change had to be made after just one year. The Cowboys landed on former Eagles defensive backs coach and passing game coordinator Christian Parker as his replacement, and it's an inspired move in a similar way that landing former Cardinals offensive line coach Klayton Adams as their offensive coordinator was last year. Parker is a Vic Fangio disciple who is very highly respected and who quickly built one of the best secondaries in the league with Philadelphia.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Seattle Seahawks have a perfect record in three NFC Championship Game appearances. The Los Angeles Rams have emerged victorious in each of their last four trips to the conference title game. One team's winning streak is about to come to an end.The top-seeded Seahawks (14-3) look to earn a berth in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 seasons when they host the No. 5 seed Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in the 2025 NFC Championship Game at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday at Lumen Field.Seattle lost its only appearance in the conference championship game when it resided in the AFC from 1977-2001, falling to the Los Angeles Raiders in 1983, but the Seahawks haven't been beaten in the contest since shifting to the NFC. The Seahawks defeated the Carolina Panthers in 2005, the San Francisco 49ers in 2013 and the Green Bay Packers the following year. All three of those games were in Seattle at Lumen Field.The Rams lost six of the first seven times they reached the NFC Championship Game but have won their last four appearances, including two when they called St. Louis home. Most recently, the club beat San Francisco in 2021 before going on to edge the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 for the second Super Bowl title in franchise history.The NFC West champion Seahawks and Rams split their two meetings this season, with each club winning at home. Los Angeles posted a 21-19 victory in Week 11 even though MVP finalist Matthew Stafford threw for only 130 yards, while Seattle rallied from a 16-point deficit in Week 16 to defeat the Rams 38-37 in overtime.Los Angeles prevailed in both of the previous playoff matchups between the division rivals, winning 27-20 in 2004 and 30-20 in 2020. The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 46.5 in the latest DraftKings NFL odds for the Los Angeles vs. Seattle NFC Championship Game showdown.Rams vs. Seahawks odds\nOpening spread: Seahawks -2.5Opening money line: Seahawks -155, Rams +130Opening total: 47.5The point spread for this matchup hasn't budged at DraftKings. There's only a one-point difference from when these teams met in Seattle on Dec. 18, when the Rams covered as 1.5-point underdogs. Rams betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 14-5 (including playoffs)ATS record: 12-7 (including playoffs)O/U record: 11-8 (Including playoffs)The Rams covered the spread in five of their final seven regular-season games but have yet to do so in the playoffs. They were favored by 10 points on the road against the Carolina Panthers in the Wild Card Round but only managed to escape with a 34-31 victory. As 3.5-point road favorites in the Divisional Round, Los Angeles advanced with a 20-17 overtime triumph in Chicago.All five of the Rams' regular-season losses were by one score, but only the setback in Seattle was by fewer than three points. Stafford was superb in that Thursday night contest, throwing for 457 yards and three touchdowns -- including a pair to Puka Nacua, who finished with 12 receptions for 225 yards. Stafford put up those numbers without the presence of Davante Adams, who missed the game with a hamstring injury.Stafford had 304 passing yards and three scoring tosses in the Rams' playoff opener against Carolina but failed to throw for a TD versus Chicago, marking the first time he has gone without a touchdown pass since the team's 13-9 victory against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17 last season. Nacua made 10 catches for 111 yards and a TD while also running for a score versus the Panthers but was kept out of the end zone by the Bears as he hauled in five passes for 56 yards. Seahawks betting profile\nOpening win total: 10.5 wins  W/L record: 15-3 (including playoffs)ATS record: 13-5 (including playoffs)O/U record: 10-8 (including playoffs)The Seahawks covered the spread in their final two regular-season contests after failing to do so in their previous two and did so with ease against the San Francisco 49ers in the Divisional Round. Seattle followed a 10-point victory as a 2.5-point favorite at San Francisco in Week 18 with a 41-6 rout of its NFC West rival at home last week while favored by seven points.Seattle covered as a three-point underdog in its first meeting with Los Angeles in 2025 but defeated the Rams by just one point as a 1.5-point favorite in the second encounter. Sam Darnold had a performance he'd like to forget in the Week 11 clash as he had 279 passing yards but threw four interceptions without a touchdown in a two-point loss. The 28-year-old was picked off by Los Angeles two more times in Week 16 but had a pair of TD tosses and threw a game-winning 2-point try in overtime.Darnold entered the Divisional Round against the 49ers nursing an oblique injury but wasn't required to do much as he completed 12-of-17 pass attempts for 124 yards and a touchdown. Kenneth Walker III provided most of the offense for the Seahawks, rushing 19 times for 116 yards and matching Shaun Alexander's franchise playoff record with three TD runs.Walker ran for a score in both regular-season meetings with the Rams and gained 100 yards on the ground in the Week 16 victory. The 25-year-old will be asked to come up with another big effort Sunday as Darnold still is showing up on the injury report and running mate Zach Charbonnet, who led Seattle with a career-high 12 rushing touchdowns, suffered a season-ending torn ACL versus San Francisco last week.Rams-Seahawks prop pick: Kenneth Walker III Over 19.5 carries\nWith Charbonnet out and Darnold unlikely to do any running because of his oblique issue, Walker likely is in for a busy day. Velus Jones Jr. rushed six times in mop-up duty last week but was ineffective, gaining only 10 yards. Jones, who had only four carries -- all in one game -- during the regular season, was placed back on the practice squad. George Holani (hamstring), who is likely to be activated from injured reserve, had 22 carries for 73 yards this season. Former Ram Cam Akers appeared in three games after being signed in late November but did not have a rushing attempt and is on the practice squad. That leaves me thinking Walker will have a heavy workload. He matched his season high with 19 carries in the Divisional Round victory and has had 20 or more attempts just three times over the last three campaigns after having at least 21 on six occasions as a rookie in 2022. But he had 25 carries against the Rams last year and set a career high with 29 versus Los Angeles in his debut season. What's more, Walker was rested last week after his third TD run early in the fourth quarter. With head coach Mike Macdonald having very few options, I expect the two-time 1,000-yard rusher to carry the ball at least 20 times with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n            ",

Los Angeles also boasts a 4-2 straight-up record at Seattle over the last six meetings, which includes a postseason contest. L.A. has the league's best offense, topping the NFL in both points and yards, as well as yards per play. It's also a team that doesn't beat itself, as Sean McVay's crew committed the fewest penalties in the regular season, and only three teams had fewer turnovers. The defense is also elite in several areas, including allowing the fewest rushing touchdowns in 2025, having the fourth-best pressure rate and notching the fifth-most takeaways. See which team to back at SportsLine. Why the Seahawks can coverNo team has a better spread record than Seattle, which has gone 13-5 versus the line over the regular plus postseason. The Seahawks are riding an eight-game outright win streak, with the last three of those all coming by double-digits against NFC playoff teams. Also, one can't discount that Seattle is coming off a Saturday game, with the Rams playing a Sunday overtime game, and the former boasts a 5-1 ATS record with a rest edge. On the field, the Seahawks' defense is the best unit in all of football, ranking first in points allowed, allowing the fewest yards per rush and giving up the fewest yards per pass. That overshadows the fact they also have the No. 3 scoring offense, and it's one which is coming off its second-most points (41) in franchise postseason history. See which team to back at SportsLine.How to make Rams vs. Seahawks    picksSportsLine's model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and is going Under on the total, projecting 46 combined points.

Toronto threw multiple defenders at Stephen Curry, forcing other players to beat them. It has been a frustrating week for coach Steve Kerr and company.With no threat of a second reliable scoring option in Butler, the Warriors are now a far easier team against which to game plan. It puts whatever slim chance the Warriors previously had at making a deep postseason run in jeopardy, unless they find the right trade before Feb. 5.While Golden State navigates waters without Butler, next season could represent even more uncharted territory. Kerr is in the final year of his contract, and according to The Ringer's Logan Murdock, several assistant coaches on Kerr's staff are \"operating under the premise that he will not return next season.\"Kerr said in September that he wants to see where things are at the end of the season before talking about a new contract.\n\"I love my job,\" Kerr said. \"I love what I'm doing every day. I can't wait to get to the building. Hopefully I'm here for another few years. But I think it makes sense for the organization and for me to see where this thing is at the end of the year -- where they are and where I am. Hopefully that means we run it back, we keep going with this group, that'd be awesome. But I like the fact we can do it how we want it.\"Kerr also said he was \"very comfortable\" entering this season on an expiring deal, as he, general manager Mike Dunleavy and owner Joe Lacob are all aligned.\"We talked about this -- there's no reason for discussion or concern, \" Kerr said. \"This is kind of a point in our relationship where let's just see how it is at the end of the year.\"\nThis doesn't sound like a situation where Kerr is itching to leave. This all might come down to what path the Warriors take in the wake of Butler's injury. If the Warriors go the nuclear route and decide it's time for a rebuild, then perhaps Kerr doesn't want to be the coach for that era.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        A new era is underway for the Baltimore Ravens, as the team announced Thursday it is hiring Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter as its new coach.Minter, 42, is replacing John Harbaugh, who won a Super Bowl, six AFC North titles and made 12 playoff appearances across 18 seasons with the franchise before he was fired on Jan. 6. The Ravens decided to go in a different direction after a season that began with significant expectations ended without a postseason berth. Harbaugh subsequently was hired by the New York Giants.\"We are thrilled to announce an agreement with Jesse Minter to be the fourth head coach in Baltimore Ravens history,\" general manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement. \"Jesse is a strong leader who possesses a brilliant football mind and a spirit that will resonate with our players and fanbase alike. Jesse comes from a football family, with success at every level of the sport, and we are confident that he is the right coach to lead the Ravens forward. Congratulations to Jesse and his wife, Rachelle, and the entire Minter family. It's time to get to work!\"\nMinter was hired by Harbaugh away from Georgia State in 2017 to be a Ravens defensive assistant. After four seasons, he left Baltimore to become a defensive coordinator at the college level. Minter spent one season at Vanderbilt before landing on the staff of Jim Harbaugh, John's brother, at Michigan. During his second season at Michigan, Minter helped the program capture its first national title since 1997. Michigan's defense allowed the fewest points in the nation that season. \nMinter then followed Jim Harbaugh to the Chargers, where in 2024 he presided over the league's top scoring defense. This year, the Chargers ranked ninth in the NFL in points allowed, fifth in passing yards allowed, eighth in rushing yards allowed, fifth in third down efficiency and fourth in red zone efficiency. Minter is coming to a Ravens team that started 1-5 before finishing with an 8-9 record. Baltimore's defense was a big reason for the team's disappointing season as it finished 18th in the league in points allowed, 30th in passing yards allowed, and tied for 27th in sacks.\nOffensively, the Ravens still have two of the league's best players in quarterback Lamar Jackson and running back Derrick Henry. The clock is ticking on both players, and Minter will be tasked with getting the most out of the remaining years of Jackson's prime. A two-time MVP, Jackson is one of the most electric players in league history, but he's played in just one AFC title game and has never been to the Super Bowl. That has created a narrative that Jackson -- despite his immense talent -- isn't quite good enough to take the Ravens to the promised land. Minter will now try to help Jackson dispel that narrative.\n            ",

Payton's quote was brought to Boutte's attention by media members on Thursday. \"I ain't seen it,\" Boutte said. \"They can rest in Cancun, too, at the end of the day. It is what it is.\" Never one to hide his feelings, Boutte said that the Texans are \"not too complicated on defense\" prior to New England's 28-16 win over Houston in the AFC divisional round. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel, however, didn't take the bait when he was asked about Payton's comments. \"I think we're plenty motivated for the game,\" Vrabel said. \nWhile he risked giving the Patriots bulletin board material, Payton's comments may have been made in an effort to raise the confidence level of not only Denver's fans, but its players, too. The Broncos, after all, will try to beat the Patriots with backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham under center after Bo Nix sustained a season-ending ankle injury during the end of last week's win over the Buffalo Bills. Payton's comments are a clear indication that he isn't giving his players a pass or a built-in excuse if Sunday's game doesn't go their way. It's clear that Payton still has the same expectations for his team. Payton wants Broncos fans to have the same expectations, too. As the AFC's top-seeded team, the Broncos are hoping that their fans can provide a home field advantage while making things difficult when Drake Maye and the rest of the Patriots' offense is on the field. Denver's home crowd certainly made its impact felt when the Broncos defeated the Patriots in the AFC title games after the 2013 and 2015 seasons. \nIf Denver wins, Payton's comment will likely become part of Broncos' history. If the Patriots win, rest assured that New England players and fans will make sure that he never lives it down. \n            \n    ",

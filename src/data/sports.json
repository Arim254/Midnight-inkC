    "body": "\n    \n    \n                    \n                Getty Images\n            \n            \n    \n        Arman Tsarukyan nearly jeopardized his UFC Fight Night main event with Dan Hooker in Doha, Qatar. During Friday's ceremonial weigh-ins, Tsarukyan struck Hooker with a head butt before UFC personnel intervened. Tsarukyan and Hooker, both of whom made weight for this weekend's main event, faced off for the cameras on Friday. Tsarukyan lunged over UFC matchmaker Mick Maynard's arm, striking Hooker with a head butt during their staredown. Both men appeared to be fine after the altercation, with neither sporting cuts or significant visible damage. \nTsarukyan is currently ranked No. 1 in the UFC's official lightweight rankings and is on the cusp of a title shot. A win over Hooker should net him a lightweight title shot. Tsarukyan threatened to derail the fight had either party been injured, and could've risked penalization from the Qatar Mixed Martial Arts Committee, the regulatory body overseeing Saturday's event.Tsarukyan already appeared to be in hot water with the promotion. He was scheduled to fight Islam Makhachev for the UFC lightweight title in January. However, he pulled out of UFC 311 on 24 hours' notice after suffering a back injury. UFC CEO Dana White, in response to Tsarukyan's withdrawal, said that Tsarukyan would need to earn another title shot. After weighing in as a back-up for Ilia Topuria vs. Charles Oliveira at UFC 317 got him halfway there, this fight with Hooker should get him over the finish line. \nThis isn't the first time Tsarukyan has gotten physical outside of the Octagon, either. In 2023, Tsarukyan grabbed UFC fighter Bobby Green by the throat in a verbal altercation turned physical. Last year, the Nevada State Athletic Commission suspended Tsarukyan for nine months after he punched a fan during his walkout at UFC 300.\n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Survivor Series: WarGames has a blockbuster main event. The WarGames stipulation returns for the fourth consecutive year with CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes, Jey Uso, Brock Lesnar and Logan Paul in the mix.Since 2022, WWE has replaced the traditional four vs. four or five vs. five Survivor Series matches with WarGames, a legendary stipulation invented by \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes. This year, world heavyweight champion Punk teams with Rhodes, Reigns and others to take on The Vision and their loose allies. Survivor Series also features the penultimate stop in John Cena's retirement tour. The new intercontinental champion will grant Dominik Mysterio a rematch before turning his attention to the winner of The Last Time is Now tournament.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Survivor Series and take a glance at the crystal ball of what may come. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited starting at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n2025 WWE Survivor Series matchesCM Punk, Cody Rhodes, The Usos (Jey Uso & Jimmy Uso) and Roman Reigns vs. The Vision (Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed & Logan Paul), Drew McIntyre and Brock Lesnar (WarGames match): Survivor Series' main event must have taken a turn after Seth Rollins suffered an injury at Crown Jewel. The Vision now moves on without him, forming an alliance with Logan Paul in the process. On Nov. 14, McIntyre joined The Vision's team to circumvent a suspension handed to him by SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis. The final spots on each team were claimed by Lesnar, siding with Heyman's group, and Reigns reuniting with his cousins.Rhea Ripley, Iyo Sky, Alexa Bliss, Charlotte Flair and AJ Lee vs. Nia Jax, Lash Legend, The Kabuki Warriors (Asuka & Kari Sane) and Becky Lynch: Multiple rivalries come to a head in this year's women's WarGames match. Ripley and Sky have been feuding with the Kabuki Warriors. WWE women's tag team champions Bliss and Flair have sparked up a fresh rivalry with the new tandem of Jax and Lash. After the match was booked, Flair exited her team, claiming she couldn't trust Ripley. That leaves two spots to fill on Ripley's team, and one for Jax's. Flair and Ripley eventually patched things up, bolstering their ranks with Lee, while Jax and company enlisted Lynch.Intercontinental Championship -- John Cena (c) vs. Dominik Mysterio: Cena is a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and the first 17-time world champion recognized by WWE, but until recently, he was not a Grand Slam champion. That's because the intercontinental title has surprisingly eluded him for two decades. On Nov. 10, Cena defeated Mysterio in an impromptu match for the intercontinental title. They will have their rematch at Survivor Series.\nWomen's World Championship -- Stephanie Vaquer (c) vs. Nikki Bella: Bella is going nowhere. Three months after a failed bid for the women's intercontinental title, Bella struck Vaquer from behind. Her villainous turn sets the stage for Vaquer's next title defense at a cornerstone WWE pay-per-view.\n            ",

    "body": "\nTwo star-studded teams in the Washington Spirit and Gotham FC will meet in San Jose for the NWSL Championship, a competitive match likely in store as each side chases their second league title.The pair took contrasting roads to the Championship, the No. 2 seed Spirit advancing as the favorites in their matchups while Gotham played spoiler as the No. 8 seed, eliminating the runaway NWSL Shield winners in the Kansas City Current and last year's champions Orlando Pride. To describe this as a David vs. Goliath-type game would be a misnomer, though, Gotham have been inconsistent, but they won the Championship just two years ago and boast an MVP nominee in Esther Gonzalez.While Gonzalez and new Gotham recruit Jaedyn Shaw headline Juan Carlos Amoros' team, the attention will also be squarely on the Spirit's Trinity Rodman. She returned from an MCL sprain in a very brief cameo in the Spirit's 2-0 win over the Portland Thorns last week, her exact status unclear. If there is any game she could play, though, it just might be one where there's a trophy on the line – in what could be her final NWSL game, her contract expiring upon the conclusion of the season.How to watch the NWSL Championship, oddsDate: Saturday, Nov. 2 | Time: 7=8 p.m. ETLocation: PayPal Park -- San Jose, Calif.Odds: Washington Spirit +130; Draw +210; Gotham FC +190Projected lineupsWashington Spirit: Aubrey Kingsbury, Rosemonde Kouassi, Esme Morgan, Rebeca Bernal, Tara McKeown, Kate Weisner, Hal Hershfelt, Leicy Santos, Croix Bethune, Trinity Rodman, Gift MondayRodman's availability will be the big talking point on Saturday, in large part because the Spirit are a different team when she is on the field. They have won nine of the 16 games she has played this season and posted a +15 goal differential along the way, while the number of wins dwindles to four in 11 games she did not play with a goal differential of -3. If Rodman cannot start, though, Italy international Sofia Cantore could fill in after starting against the Thorns while the Spirit's attacking plans will run through Gift Monday regardless, the Nigerian scoring 10 goals so far this season.Gotham FC: Ann-Katrin Berger, Bruninha, Emily Sonnett, Jess Carter, Lily Reale, Jaelin Howell, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Gabi Portillo, Midge Purce, Esther GonzalezGotham's defensive stability has kept them afloat in a year of inconsistent attacking output, though not from a lack of effort on Gonzalez's part. The Spain international has 13 goals this season, just two behind MVp winner Temwa Chawinga, and Shaw's scintillating form has helped Gotham make up some of the attacking deficit left behind after Yazmeen Ryan and Lynn Biyendolo's departures in the offseason. Rose Lavelle is also in strong form, connecting expertly with international teammate Shaw to revive Gotham's offense at just the right time.PredictionThere is motivation and narrative to support either team's argument, setting up for a closely-contested Championship game – and perhaps a spicy one, if last year's semifinal in which the Spirit ousted Gotham on penalty kicks is anything to go by. This one will likely come down to a moment of brilliance from a star and there is no one who is more in-form than Shaw. She has two goals and an assist during Gotham's postseason run, a contribution on each and every goal they have scored in the playoffs so far. She has helped them pull off two upsets in a row, a third not exactly out of reach for a roster just as stacked as the one they will face. Pick: Washington Spirit 1, Gotham FC 2 (after extra time)\n            ",

I'm expecting Wilson to do well again in Week 12 against Jacksonville with Harrison still sidelined, and Wilson is one of my favorite DFS plays for this scoring period.Wilson will be popular in Week 12, especially since he's a great price at $4,800 on DraftKings and $6,300 on FanDuel. And he has a favorable matchup against the Jaguars, who have allowed nine receivers to score at least 12 PPR points this season.Against the 49ers, Wilson had 15 catches for 185 yards on 18 targets, but I obviously wouldn't expect that level of production again, especially since Jacoby Brissett attempted 57 passes against San Francisco. That said, Brissett has attempted at least 44 passes in three of five starts in place of Kyler Murray (foot), and Harrison averaged 11 targets per game in two outings before getting injured.This should be another productive game for Wilson in Week 12. And I'm excited to use him in my DFS lineups on DraftKings and FanDuel.\nFor more of my DFS plays for Week 12, click on this link to SportsLine.

    "body": "\nFlorida State and NC State both started their respective football seasons with lofty expectations. Now, they are fighting just to receive a bowl bid, but one of them will be guaranteed this modest milestone when the clubs meet Friday night. Kickoff is set for 8 p.m. ET from Carter-Finley Stadium in the nationally televised contest. The Seminoles (5-5) dominated Week 1 headlines following their 31-17 upset of Alabama as two-touchdown underdogs. The victory soothed memories of their miserable two-win campaign a year ago and sparked hopes of a potential run to the ACC title and a playoff berth. However, that opening-week victory remains the highlight of their season. A double-overtime loss to Virginia launched a four-game skid that rock-bottomed into a 20-13 loss to downtrodden Stanford as a nearly three-touchdown favorite. The Seminoles have managed to win two of their past three but still sit behind the Cardinal in the ACC standings.Conversely, the Wolfpack (5-5) emerged as an early-season ACC dark horse behind victories over East Carolina, Virginia and Wake Forest. Those wins aged well, considering those three clubs now have a combined record of 23-8. But NC State's season hasn't progressed the same way as its fallen opponents. The Wolfpack have lost three of their past four games by an average of nearly 29 points per contents and are coming off a 41-7 drubbing at the hands of Miami. Even so, their lone victory in that span came in a 48-36 upset of previously undefeated Georgia Tech in which they racked up 583 yards of total offense. The performance served as a reminder of this team's impressive ceiling, though its floor is equal parts confounding. The Seminoles are 6.5-point favorites and the over/under for total points scored is 59.5 in the latest college football odds for Florida State vs. NC State. In addition to the CFB contest, we'll preview NBA and NHL matchups. The following is a snapshot of what to watch for Friday, Nov. 21.

The Wolfpack and Seminoles average more than 66 points per game combined and are averaging 45 points per game across their last four combined victories. Even so, the model's 10,000-game simulation is projecting an average final score of 30-25 in favor of Florida State. This data results in a slight lean toward the home underdog with the points but a strong play on the Under 59.5 points. The model sees the Under hitting 61% of the time, a stark contrast to the implied sportsbook odds of 52%. More CFB best betsCFB expert Bruce Marshall's top Week 13 CFB playsNHL best bets today, where to watchHurricanes at Jets Time: 8 p.m. | Location: Winnipeg | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Jets +127 Following an offensive funk in which they scored just two goals combined in three games, all losses, the Jets have bounced back with a recent offensive surge. They have scored 17 goals across their last four contests, and the SportsLine Projection Model sees them keeping up the production Friday night. The Hurricanes are 7-3-1 away from their home ice but are coming off a 4-3 loss to Minnesota in the second of a four-game road swing. The model sees the Jets winning outright 63% of the time, suggesting it believes the wrong team is favored. The lucrative plus-money payout for the home underdog has prompted a rare A-rated model selection on Winnipeg. NBA best bets today, where to watchNuggets at Rockets Time: 9:30 p.m. | Location: Houston | TV: Prime Video | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)\nSportsLine picks -- Model: Over 234.5 points The Rockets are slight favorites to win their sixth consecutive game in this showdown of Western Conference stalwarts that are both off to a sizzling start. The Nuggets have won eight of their past nine and have scored at least 122 in each of their past five outings. Both clubs are in the top six in the NBA in scoring defense, but the model sees their offensive prowess prevailing in this matchup. The model's 10,000-game simulation is projecting an average of 241 points, sending this contest Over the total about 58% of the time.

The OU Sooners (8-2, 4-2 SEC) are coming off an upset of then-fourth ranked Alabama, 23-21, giving Oklahoma back-to-back road wins over ranked teams after defeating Tennessee in Week 10. The Mizzou Tigers (7-3, 3-3 SEC) ended a two-game losing streak with a 49-27 win over Mississippi State on Saturday, which thrust Missouri back into the AP Top 25. Missouri quarterback Beau Pribula (ankle) has been removed from the availability report after last playing on Oct. 25, meaning he's expected to be available for this one.Kickoff is at noon ET from Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman, Okla. This is the second SEC matchup of these former Big 12 rivals, with Mizzou winning the first, 30-23, last season.

The mandate banning athletes and staff from betting remains in place after the board rejected a rule change permitting pro sports gambling on Friday.Last month, the NCAA Division I Board voted to delay a legislative change that would permit college athletes and athletic department staff to gamble on professional sports. The rule change, originally intended to go into effect on Nov. 1, was delayed to Nov. 22 after pushback from SEC commissioner Greg Sankey and other prominent voices. Each Division I school was given 30 days to vote to rescind the proposal, since it was adopted by less than 75% of the cabinet. More than two-thirds voted to stop the rule change, crossing the threshold needed one day before the 30-day period expired. The amendment would have only affected betting on pro sports. Betting on college games and sharing information with bettors would have remained prohibited regardless of the outcome. The decision follows a high-profile federal investigation into sports betting and illegal gambling. On Oct. 23, Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones were among more than 30 people arrested by the FBI as part of two extensive federal grand jury investigations.\nOn Friday, an NCAA investigation found that former Temple guard Hysier Miller placed bets on and against his own team. Two weeks ago, the NCAA revoked eligibility from six men's basketball players over allegations of sports betting. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Lane Kiffin Watch continues. After meeting with Kiffin on Friday, Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said the focus is on next Friday's Egg Bowl vs. rival Mississippi State and that \"an announcement on Coach Kiffin's future is expected the Saturday following the game.\"That statement comes in the aftermath of what has been a wild week in Oxford, Mississippi. After a plane carrying multiple Kiffin family members, including ex-wife Layla Kiffin, traveled to Baton Rouge on Monday, the discussion of whether Kiffin will stay or go cranked into overdrive. There was also a less-publicized Kiffin family trip to Gainesville, Florida, the day before as the Gators continue to make their play for Kiffin's services, sources confirmed to CBS Sports. While it is unlikely there will be definitive clarity before next Saturday, numerous sources with knowledge of the situation have told CBS Sports in the last 24 hours that they believe the momentum has shifted in LSU's favor to land the talented head coach. To be clear, that does not mean it's a done deal. Throughout the week, Kiffin has seemingly gone back and forth by the day while trying to make a decision. For example, there were multiple days this week that sources felt like it was trending toward Kiffin taking the job at LSU only for it to then come across the next day like he was giving real thought to staying at Ole Miss. \"It's like following a high school recruiting process,\" one source said.Sources have indicated throughout the week that they believe Florida is running third in the Kiffin sweepstakes. \n\n        \n            \n                Ole Miss wants clarity from Lane Kiffin. He's not in a position to give it. What's next?\n                \n                    John Talty                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAccording to those who know him well, Kiffin can struggle when making big decisions, which is why so many are hesitant to say definitively what he will do until he signs the contract. As many have pointed out in recent days, it felt like a foregone conclusion at one point that Kiffin was going to take the Auburn job back in 2022 before he ultimately decided to stay in Oxford. No. 6 Ole Miss (10-1) closes its regular season with the Egg Bowl against Mississippi State with a win potentially giving the Rebels a first-round home game in the College Football Playoff. CBS Sports reported earlier this week that sources said if Ole Miss was convinced Kiffin was not staying long-term in Oxford, it would not let him coach in the playoff. Ole Miss hoped to get clarity this week on Kiffin's decision, prompting Friday's meeting between Carter, Kiffin and Ole Miss chancellor Glenn Boyce. \"Coach Kiffin and I have had many pointed and positive conversations regarding his future at Ole Miss, including meeting today with Chancellor Boyce,\" Carter said. \"While we discuss next steps, we know we cannot lose sight of what is most important -- our sixth-ranked team that is poised to finish the regular season in historic fashion.\"\nCarter's statement made clear Kiffin will be coaching the Egg Bowl -- but now attention turns to whether that will be his last as Ole Miss' coach. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Mikel Arteta has insisted that Arsenal can weather the storm of \"weeks\" without their defensive leader Gabriel as injuries threaten to derail the Gunners ahead of a pivotal week.Gabriel injured his thigh in Brazil's 2-0 win over Senegal on Saturday and is due for further scans on Wednesday as Arsenal look to ascertain a clearer timescale on the recovery of their defensive leader. Initial fears pegged the 27 year old as facing up to two months on the sidelines but for the time being Arteta remains reluctant to offer further clarity.\"He's going to be out for weeks,\" said Arteta. \"We need to have another scan and we'll have the timeline much clearer than we have at the moment. It's clearly a blow, it's our leader in our backline. It's never a positive thing to lose him. The good thing is we have very good options and people have to stand up now and do the job.\"To complicate matters further Riccardo Calafiori remains a doubt for Sunday's north London derby having missed training during the international break. The Italian national team sent Calafiori back to Arsenal after initial tests on his thigh injury and Arteta revealed that the 23-year-old, an ever present in his Premier League XIs this season, had been playing through pain.\n\"He's been carrying a few things and we had to bring him back. He hasn't trained yet. Tomorrow we have another training session, let's see how he is.\"The injuries to the Arsenal backline are all the more frustratingly timed for Arteta given that they come just as the headaches in the frontline appeared to be easing. The league leaders reached the international break without six attacking options and their manager was customarily circumspect when asked which of Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus, Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke might be available for the visit of Tottenham. \"I can [tell you] but I'm not going to do it,\" he joked.His circumspection would suggest that at least some of those will be available. Martinelli is understood to have trained during the break and there has been speculation that both Odegaard and Madueke could be involved in some capacity. Arteta indicated he was as optimistic about the sextet as he had been in a relatively buoyant press conference before the international break and the 1-1 draw with Sunderland. However his insistence on keeping cards close to his chest will at least keep Thomas Frank guessing until an hour and a quarter before kickoff on Sunday.\n\"It's the final stage,\" he said, \"and now is when there is contact around them, when they have to be pushed into very unpredictable things that they haven't done. I think they are going to be with us soon, I don't know if Sunday is going to be too soon.\"\n        \n            \n                Ballon d'Or Power Rankings: Defenders don't usually win it, but Arsenal's Gabriel is making his case\n                \n                    James Benge                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHowever many forwards return it would be fair to wonder if Arteta would trade them all for Gabriel's fitness. The Brazilian is the rock on which the best defense in Europe is built, Arsenal having conceded five goals in 17 games across all competitions, and that is to say nothing of the devastation he routinely causes from set pieces. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that Gabriel might have a serious chance of winning some of the sport's biggest individual prizes if he were to be fit throughout the season, a prospect that is looking increasingly slim. No matter how long he is out, Gabriel will be missed. \"Every player brings their specific qualities and Gabriel is his leadership, his presence and the love that he has to defend and to transmit as well his body language to other players. We have to do it, and we have to spread that.\"\nIt is something Arteta believes his squad can do. \"People will step up, we've done it in the past many, many times. Unfortunately, we played last year the biggest and most problematic part of the season without him as well, and the team was able to cope with that.\"In that Arteta is referring to the run to the end of last season in which Arsenal had to do without Gabriel -- and a host of other key players. The hamstring injury that seemed to be a hammer blow to their Champions League prospects, coming as it did on the eve of their quarterfinal against Real Madrid, did not necessarily destroy the Gunners, who lost only three of their final 12 matches.Then again as they staggered to the finish line they conceded 13 goals and allow a little over an expected goal per game. Before Gabriel went down it was 39 against in 46, 0.88 xG against per match. Jakub Kiwior stepped in impressively, raising his standing among supporters, but he was no Gabriel. Piero Hincapie might be one of the best back up center backs in the league but Gabriel is one of the best center backs in the world. Calafiori too, another option to fill in next to William Saliba, is a great talent. He just isn't Gabriel. No one is.\nViewing informationDate: Sunday, Nov. 23 | Time: 11:30 a.m. ETLocation: Emirates Stadium -- LondonLive stream: PeacockPredicted lineupsArsenal XI: David Raya; Jurrien Timber, William Saliba, Piero Hincapie, Riccardo Calafiori; Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice; Bukayo Saka, Eberechi Eze, Leandro Trossard; Mikel MerinoTottenham XI: Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Rodrigo Bentancur, Joao Palhinha, Pape Matar Sarr; Mohamed Kudus, Richarlison, Wilson Odobert\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Heading into Week 12, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is an inner-circle NFL MVP candidate. He's either the favorite or second favorite at basically every sportsbook in Vegas, and rightfully so. Stafford has completed 66% of his passes at an average of 7.6 yards per attempt, with a league-leading 27 touchdowns against just two interceptions. He has a career-high 112.7 passer rating and 68.7 QBR, and he checks in fifth in Tru Media's version of EPA per dropback and second in passing success rate. He recently became the first quarterback in history to throw for four-plus touchdowns and no interceptions in three consecutive games. He hasn't been picked off at all since Week 3, and he's thrown multiple touchdown passes in all but one game since then.His mind-meld connection with Puka Nacua (73 receptions for 850 yards in nine games) is alive and well, and every time he throws to Davante Adams (43 receptions for 569 yards and 10 touchdowns), it seemingly ends with Adams standing in the end zone, arms spread wide and celebrating a score.\nThis weekend against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Stafford has a chance to strengthen his case even further. \nFirst of all, it's a game against another NFC playoff team, just like the one the Rams won last week against the Seattle Seahawks. And that's going to keep a bunch of eyes on it -- especially because the game is happening on \"Sunday Night Football.\" More importantly, the Bucs have a pass-funnel defense that is far better against the run than it is against the pass, which typically pushes opponents into pass-happy game plans. The Bucs are second in opponents' rushing success rate, via Tru Media, and only 20th in passing success rate. \nThey're fresh off allowing Josh Allen to throw for 317 yards and three touchdowns last week, and Drake Maye to go for 270 yards and two scores the week before. They forced a trio of interceptions in those two games, but Stafford just hasn't really put the ball in danger all year. He's second in turnover-worthy throw rate (interceptions plus dropped interceptions, divided by pass attempts) per Tru Media, with just four such throws all season.  The Bucs are likely to be overmatched in the secondary, especially with cornerback Jamel Dean unable to suit up due to injury, and Stafford gets rid of the ball too quickly (his average time to throw is 2.66 seconds, fifth-fastest among 34 qualified quarterbacks) for the pass rush to get home and affect his rhythm. Tampa will also be without Haason Reddick, who has been out since Week 7.\n        \n            \n                Rams vs. Buccaneers: Where to watch Sunday's matchup, plus pick, odds, injuries and what you need to know\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNacua and Adams should have advantageous matchups on the perimeter and in the slot, even if guys like Jacob Parrish and Benjamin Morrison have acquitted themselves fairly well for rookies so far this year. Antoine Winfield Jr. and Tykee Smith will be able to provide help, of course, but nobody has really proven they can stop the Nacua-Adams duo so far this year. It's probably not going to be this Bucs unit that has routinely allowed inferior pass offenses to put up big games.\nThe Rams will also get into heavy personnel and force the Bucs to decide whether to match with base defense and provide good matchups in the passing game, or stay in nickel personnel and allow Los Angeles to run the ball into lighter boxes with extra blockers. If they match with base defense, the tight ends could get going; if they don't, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum could start getting downhill and set up the play-action pass, which the Rams run more than almost anybody in the league. By the time the weekend is over, Stafford could be the odds-on favorite everywhere to take home the MVP trophy. The matchup is in his favor, and the way he's playing, he'd likely be able to put up that type of game even if it wasn't.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is in the final year of his contract, and many speculate the 2025 season will be his last. Now 36-years-old, Kelce understands he will have a decision to make in the near future, but he won't keep his franchise guessing whether he plans to retire, or continue playing in 2026. \"I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity, whether I come back or not -- or whether they want me back or not,\" Kelce said, via ESPN. \"I'd like to make that decision before they've got to get draft picks and free agency opens to fill the roster appropriately.\"All that will be at the end of the season. I won't be thinking about it until then.\"While he's in the midst of his 13th NFL season, Kelce is still productive. Through 10 games played, he leads the Chiefs with 50 catches for 631 yards and four touchdowns. Regarded as one of the best tight ends in NFL history, Kelce currently ranks third on the all-time receiving list at his position with 12,782 yards, trailing only Jason Witten (13,046 yards) and Chiefs legend Tony Gonzalez (15,127). However, Kelce is Kansas City's all-time leader in receptions (1,054), receiving yards and touchdowns (81). \nA three-time Super Bowl champion, Kelce has established himself as the best postseason tight end in NFL history. He is the NFL's all-time postseason leader in receptions (178), and just the third player to lead three Super Bowl champions in receiving yards, joining Hall of Fame wide receivers Jerry Rice and Michael Irvin. Kelce and Patrick Mahomes have connected for 18 touchdowns in the playoffs, which are the most scores by a duo in NFL postseason history -- three more than Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski.Prior to Super Bowl LIX eight months ago, it was reported that Kelce's decision to retire or play in 2025 could hinge on the outcome of their showdown with the Philadelphia Eagles, despite him telling reporters on Super Bowl Opening Night that he hoped to be playing football for years to come. The Chiefs were blown out by Jalen Hurts and Co. 40-22. Less than a month after the Super Bowl LIX loss, Kelce confirmed he was returning for his 13th season. He even said on his \"New Heights\" podcast that it was the Super Bowl loss that motivated him to keep playing.\n\"It was probably the biggest factor,\" Kelce said of his decision to return, via NFL.com. \"I mean, it's a pretty cool way to go out, but I just think I would still have this love for the game. ... I think I would have thought about it more if we would've won.\"While the Chiefs sit at 5-5 entering Week 12, they still have Super Bowl aspirations. Kelce is focused on winning football games right now, instead of his future or a farewell tour. \"I think the biggest thing is that I f-----g love playing the game of football,\" Kelce said this offseason. \"I love playing. I still feel like I can play it at a high level and possibly at a higher level than I did last year. I don't think it was my best outing. I think I let my guys down in a lot more moments than I helped them, especially if you look at my track record and how I've been in years past. I want to give it a good run. I got a bad taste in my mouth in how I ended last year and how well I was playing and how accountable I was to the people around me.\n\"I love so many people in Kansas City, both in that facility, in the community, and it's home for me now. I don't want to leave that life yet. I put in a lot of hard work and I put in a lot of focus into being the best that I can for K.C. Last year it didn't end well for us. I just feel like there's a responsibility in me to play out the contract that I initially signed, to give Kansas City and the Chiefs organization everything that I've got, and that's what I'm going to do, man.\"\n            ",

Though that is around $300,000 less than he was making at Penn State, it does keep him among the top 20 highest-paid coaches in college football.Franklin's compensation is also staggered. He's set to make $500,000 in base annual salary with the rest of the money coming from incentives. Franklin will make more money each year of the deal, with the contract's value set to peak at $12.75 million in 2030. Notably, Virginia Tech is also increasing Franklin's salary pool to $15.5 million, which means that he'll have plenty of money to assemble his inaugural coaching staff with the Hokies. Here's a look at the other incentives baked into Franklin's first contract: \nHe can make up to $250,000 in bonuses for 12-win seasons. He'll be awarded $150,000 for any coach of the year awards. Franklin will receive bonuses for ACC Championship Game and College Football Playoff appearances with an $800,000 for winning a national title. Penn State and Franklin also agreed to a reduced buyout in light of his hiring at Virginia Tech. Instead of paying Franklin $49 million over the course of six years, Penn State is on the hook for just $9 million of Franklin's previous agreement with the school. Penn State fired Franklin in October amid a 3-3 start to the 2025 season. He departed the Nittany Lions with a 104-45 overall record, three top-10 finishes in the AP Top 25 poll, one Big Ten title (2016) and an appearance in the 2024 College Football Playoff. \nFranklin is set to replace Brent Pry, his former defensive coordinator at Penn State. Pry never won more than seven games with the Hokies, who were 0-3 at the time of his departure in September.  \n            \n    ",

For detailed rationale, check out my latest content, including my weekly Lineup Decisions column.                      What do the numbers mean?\nAll of my analyses from the week, from data points to matchup outlooks to game-flow predictions, are basically represented by a number on a confidence scale from 1-10. The higher the number next to a player's name, the more confident I am that you should start him. The numbers are not a projection, just a confidence score to help you pick who to start. Every relevant player for this week is here, so if a player isn't listed, don't start him.                      To find a specific player, use your search function -- CTRL-F on PCs and Command-F on Macs. If neither of those are options, or if you're on a mobile device, you can scroll by game. If you're still unsure, just send a note on X.com (@daverichard) and I'll give it a look, time permitting. Remember to use the #AskFFT hashtag!                      If you're reading this on Sunday, please refer to our weekly rankings, which are updated in real time.                  Ready to get off on the right foot?

In New York, the show is scheduled to air after the Jets-Ravens game, at approximately 5 p.m., but viewers are being advised to check their local listings for the exact air time in their region. The show will take a look back on the top moments from the year, along with a preview of the Mubadala Abu Dhabi Sail Grand Prix Season 2025 Grand Final that will be held Nov 29-30.The aim of the Rolex SailGP Championship has been to redefine the sport of sailing by bringing the action closer to the shore so that fans can experience the thrill of seeing the massive 50-foot foiling catamarans whiz by at speeds exceeding 60 miles per hour. \nThe show will be the sailing fan's ultimate guide to the season thus far and will spotlight the world's best athletes across four continents. Some footage shown will include the U.S. SailGP Team making the podium in Dubai, ROCKWOOL Denmark breaking the SailGP speed record, and crashes and collapses on the water. Interviews with the U.S. SailGP team and commentary from all event winners will also be part of the broadcast.The Grand Final event, which will consist of two days of 12-boat fleet races, is scheduled for next weekend. Points earned during the preliminary races will determine the three teams to advance to final race, a single, winner-take-all showdown -- and the $2 million prize, the largest in the sport, that will go to the champions. \nThe top three national teams on the leaderboard are Emirates representing Great Britain, the Black Foils of New Zealand and the BONDS Flying Roos out of Australia. However, do not discount last year's winners, Spain's Los Gallos. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        Basketball in the Bahamas for the Baha Mar wraps this week with a matchup straight from the dreams of paradise as No. 1 Purdue and No. 15 Texas Tech meet late on CBS Sports Network for the event's championship game. The matchup features two preseason top-10 teams who have each been tested this week in the Bahamas, and who each have responded with resilience to march into Friday's finale. No. 1 Purdue punched its championship game ticket after stiff-arming a tougher-than-expected push from Memphis on Thursday. Memphis led by as many as nine points early before the Boilermakers tracked them down and raced out for what turned out to be a cushy 80-71 victory. \n        \n            \n                College basketball rankings: Purdue survives Memphis to set up clash vs. Texas Tech for Baha Mar Championship\n                \n                    Gary Parrish                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nNo. 15 Texas Tech defeated Wake Forest in its own battle Thursday after it traded blows with Wake Forest for a full 40 minutes. The game featured nine lead changes and finished with an 84-83 Red Raiders victory.  Here is everything you need to know about Friday's showdown.    Where to watch Purdue vs. Texas Tech  live    Date: Friday, Nov. 21 | Time: 9:30 p.m. ET     Location: Baha Mar Convention Center -- Nassau, Bahamas   \tTV: CBS Sports Network [Channel finder]  \tLive stream: CBSSports.com | Mobile: CBS Sports App   Purdue vs. Texas Tech: Need to know  Offensive fireworks: Purdue owns the No. 1 offense in adjusted efficiency metrics at KenPom.com this season, while Texas Tech -- No. 12 in adjusted efficiency -- is no slouch itself on that end. That combo along with both team's inconsistent early defensive sequences could give us a shootout. Vegas seems to think that may be the case, too: The over/under on the game is 153.5. \nStars aplenty: Texas Tech forward JT Toppin, the reigning Big 12 Player of the Year, leads all Big 12 players this season in rebounds per game (10.0) and is averaging 23.5 points per game to boot. Purdue guard Braden Smith is averaging 9.0 assists per game -- second in college basketball -- while teammate Trey Kaufman-Renn is averaging 16.0 points and 13.7 boards per game. There's enough star power here to deliver us a dandy tonight. Good chance there are at least three All-Americans -- and maybe more! -- taking place in tonight's action.  3-point strength: Texas Tech's scoring this season has been boosted significantly by a reliance on its 3-point shot. Of all its points scored, 41.2% of its offense can be attributed to 3-pointers, per KenPom data -- which is 23rd-most in college basketball. That strength may match up well vs. a Purdue team that is 147th in 3-point percentage allowed this season. Tech's propensity to fill it up from deep and to do it a consistently high level will be among the bigger storylines that decides the outcome.     Purdue vs. Texas Tech prediction, pick  \nOdds via Caesars Sportsbook Texas Tech keeps this game close but Purdue pulls out a close one. That's my official prediction. Tech has the size, skill and physicality to match the Boilermakers, and their offense can be good enough not just to keep it close, but to pull off the upset. I think the play here for me would be to take the points on the underdog in what on paper is a pretty even matchup. Pick: Texas Tech +3.5 \nWho will win and cover in every college basketball game? Visit SportsLine to get picks from the model that simulates each game 10,000 times and is up more than $1,200 for $100 players on its top-rated spread picks the past six years.   \n            ",

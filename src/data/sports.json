    "body": "\nTeams streaking in opposite directions will meet on 'Monday Night Football' as the San Francisco 49ers visit the Indianapolis Colts. The Niners (10-4) have won four straight, all of them coming by multiple scores, including a 37-24 win over Tennessee in Week 15. The Colts (8-6), meanwhile, are riding a four-game losing streak and fell to Seattle, 18-16, last week. Quarterback Philip Rivers, who came out of retirement last week following Daniel Jones' Achilles injury, will start again for the Colts with rookie Riley Leonard backing him up. Cornerback Sauce Gardner (calf) is out for Indianapolis. Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) is out for the Niners. Kickoff is at 8:15 p.m. ET from Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The latest 49ers vs. Colts odds from DraftKings Sportsbook have San Francisco as the 4.5-point road favorite, while the over/under for total points scored is 46.

San Fran also has a huge primetime advantage when it comes to the spread, as it has covered in all three such games this year, while Indy is 0-5 ATS over its last five under the bright lights of primetime. Despite batting major injuries all year, the Niners still rank among the top four in both third-down offense and passing offense. The Colts' offense should have difficulty keeping up with the 49ers as Indianapolis has scored 20 or fewer points in four straight games. See which team to back at SportsLine.Why the Colts can coverThe Colts have owned this series recently, winning five straight overall matchups and going 9-3 over the last dozen home meetings. Indy controls the trenches, leading the NFL in rushing touchdowns while ranking second by allowing just 3.7 yards per rush. The ground game is already a struggle for the 49ers, who rank 31st with 3.5 yards per carry, and Rivers should find more success in his second week back. He's had a full week in the practice facility, is at home instead of a hostile environment like Seattle, and the Niners rank dead last in the NFL in defensive sacks. See which team to back at SportsLine. How to make Colts vs. 49ers           picksFor 49ers vs. Colts   on 'Monday Night Football,' the model is leaning Over the total, projecting 52 combined points.

The Rockets will also be guided by interim head coach Robert Weiner after Jason Candle accepted the UConn job this month. A handful of Louisville players are opting out of the Boca Raton Bowl, but in addition to losing Candle, Toledo will also be without edge rusher Malachi Davis, who chose to enter the transfer portal after recording 5.5 sacks. The model predicts that the Cardinals cover the spread in 57% of simulations. Bet on college football at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users can get $200 in bonus bets:Western Kentucky money line vs. Southern Miss Tyson Helton led the Hilltoppers to an 8-4 season in Conference USA, while Southern Miss went 7-5 in the Sun Belt and then lost head coach Charles Huff to Memphis. Western Kentucky did lose running back La'Vell Wright (10 rushing touchdowns) and cornerback Dylan Flowers (four passes defensed) to the transfer portal, but should have better overall continuity with Helton staying put.

Philip Rivers' return to the NFL at age 44 has become one of the most-discussed sports topics of 2025, and on Monday, he'll take the field in front of a national audience when the Indianapolis Colts host the San Francisco 49ers. SportsLine's advanced computer model is backing Rivers and Colts to keep the game competitive, playing the Colts as 5.5-point underdogs as a part of its Monday NFL best bets at DraftKings Sportsbook. The over/under for Colts vs. 49ers is 46 points, down a half-point from the opening line.The model also has one of its Monday best bets coming from NBA action, backing the Oklahoma City Thunder to cover as 15.5-point favorites against the Memphis Grizzlies.

The Colts kept the Seahawks out of the end zone for the entire game, resulting in six Seattle field goals and culminating with Jason Myers needing to convert a 56-yard kick with 18 seconds left for the win. Rivers completed 66.7 percent of his passes (18 of 27) for 120 yards, but commanded the offense enough to have the Colts in the game late. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 87 yards, and the model expects Rivers and the offense to make enough plays to keep this contest close as well. The model projects the Colts to cover in 53% of simulations. Back the Colts at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Thunder (-15.5) vs. Grizzlies (-115)The Thunder have dropped two of their last three games, but that shouldn't create a cause for concern for Monday or the remainder of the season. Oklahoma City still has a chance at a historic season after winning 24 of its first 25 games and opening the season at 25-3 after winning last year's NBA championship. The Grizzlies are without Ja Morant (ankle), and they are coming off a 130-122 home loss on Saturday to the Wizards, which resulted in just Washington's fifth win of the season. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is having another MVP-caliber season at 32.5 points per game, which ranks second in the league, for OKC. Back the Thunder at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets if your first $5 bet wins:Magic (+5.5) vs. Warriors (-105)\"Some injuries to note both ways here (Franz Wagner out and Jalen Suggs doubtful for Orlando; Steph Curry out for Golden State), but the Magic won't be lacking for confidence after beating the Warriors with Curry by a 121-113 count on November 18 when Desmond Bane scored 23,\" legendary SportsLine expert Bruce Marshall said. \"Note that Orlando was also minus Paolo Banchero for the first meeting, and he has since returned, after Jamahl Mosley's Magic kept things close vs. the Dubs in both meetings during an injury-filled 2024-25 campaign. Steve Kerr has even admitted frustration lately with his Warriors, who had lost three straight before nipping the Suns by 2 in Phoenix on Saturday after losing three of the previous four at Chase Center.

    "body": "\n        The New York Mets have sent second baseman Jeff McNeil to the Athletics in a holiday week trade, the team announced Monday. The A's will also receive nearly $6 million in cash considerations to help cover McNeil's salary, and the Mets will pay for McNeil's buyout if the A's elect against exercising his club option for next season. The Mets, in turn, will receive a young pitching prospect, right-hander Yordan Rodriguez.McNeil should slot in at the keystone for the A's, who were known to be investigating potential second-base upgrades this offseason. Over the past three years, he's hit .253/.326/.389 (101 OPS+) with per-season averages of 11 home runs and 2 Wins Above Replacement. \nFor comparison, the Athletics' collection of second basemen hit .199/.267/.283 with 11 home runs. (That group was led by Luis Urías and Zack Gelof.)McNeil, 33, is entering the final guaranteed season of his contract. He's slated to earn $15.75 million in 2026 with a club option that would pay him an identical sum in 2027. Given the terms of the trade, the A's would seem more likely to instead decline the option. \nRodriguez, 17, threw in eight games as part of the Dominican Summer League. He compiled a 2.93 ERA and a 2.50 strikeout-to-walk ratio.  The Mets reduced their need for McNeil earlier this winter, first by acquiring second baseman Marcus Semien from the Texas Rangers in exchange for outfielder Brandon Nimmo, and then by signing veteran infielder Jorge Polanco to a two-year pact. The Mets have also allowed longtime first baseman Pete Alonso to leave for the Baltimore Orioles through free agency, ensuring they'll have a new-look infield in 2026. (The Mets also lost closer Edwin Díaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers, albeit while signing two former Yankees in Devin Williams and Luke Weaver.)On a related note: left-hander David Peterson, himself subject to trade rumors, is now the final Mets player standing who played at the big-league level under the Wilpon ownership group, per The Athletic.\nIt's to be seen how the Mets navigate the rest of the winter. In addition to Peterson, New York has been reportedly open to moving starter Kodai Senga and a slew of young infielders (Mark Vientos and Brett Baty among them). The Mets have been connected to some of the top free-agent hitters, too, in outfielders Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        'Tis the season to be jolly, or so they say. With Christmas upon us, we enter what is basically a six-day week. However, surprisingly, the schedule is relatively 'normal', with only one team playing twice, that being the Brooklyn Nets. We have 18 teams suiting up three times, while the remaining 11 teams will take to the court on three occasions each. Sitting players who only go two or three times has its advantages, but fantasy managers still have to make smart decisions when figuring out whom to play, regardless of game count. Being aware of back-to-back sets is also a key factor, especially with so many teams now sitting players due to injury management.Four Games: CLE, DAL, DEN, DET, IND, MEM, NOP, OKC, ORL, POR, UTAThree Games: ATL, BOS, CHA, CHI, GSW, HOU, LAC, LAL, MIA, MIL, MIN, NYK, PHI, PHO, SAC, SAS, TOR, WASTwo Games: BKNHere are four potential starts and four potential sits entering the tenth week of the NBA season. Just keep in mind that this is based on games played for the week. If you play in a rotisserie league, the number of games played each week may not matter in your format.\nGuardsConsider starting: Cam Spencer, MEMOpponents: @OKC, @UTA, MIL, @WASWith injuries continuing to plague the Grizzlies, Spencer has emerged as a must-roster player, even in standard leagues. While the eventual return of both Ty Jerome and Scottie Pippen will complicate things, Spencer simply needs to be prioritized, at least for the foreseeable future. Many might argue that Spencer has been a better option than Ja Morant this season, which has some statistical evidence. In 11 games over the past month, Spencer has averaged 17.1 points, 5.7 assists, 0.9 steals, and 3.5 three-pointers, shooting 59.6 percent from the floor and 100 percent from the line. With four games tabled for week 10, as well as continued injury risk attached to Morant, Spencer is a no-brainer when it comes to selecting your starting lineup.Consider starting: Ryan Nembhard, DALOpponents: @NOP, DEN, @GSW, @SACThe sit-start decision is a little trickier when it comes to Nembhard, despite the fact that he seems locked in as the starting point guard. Head coach Jason Kidd is no stranger when it comes to weird rotations, and that certainly goes for Nembhard. While he has started in 10 straight games, his playing time has fluctuated on a nightly basis, ranging from 21 to 38 minutes. With that said, his assist numbers have been relatively consistent, while those behind him in the rotation have done very little to further their case for more playing time. There could certainly be a dud on the horizon. However, with four games in the next seven days, there should be enough meat on the bone for managers to shift Nembhard in their starting lineups.Consider sitting: Ryan Rollins, MILOpponents: @IND, @MEM, @CHISpeaking of coaches who are known for curious decision-making, Doc Rivers absolutely falls into that category. While the return of Kevin Porter was always going to impact Ryan Rollins, managers may have underestimated the impact Rivers' mindset would have. Rollins has now come off the bench in two consecutive games and has played fewer than 30 minutes in five straight contests. His production has remained viable despite the reduced role, so he is definitely not someone managers will want to drop. However, with limited opportunities, there is a chance that limited production could follow. Rollins played just six minutes in the first half during Sunday's loss to the Timberwolves, a worrying sign despite his 16 minutes in the second half. Moving him to the bench might be a safe option, at least until some sort of sanity returns to Milwaukee.\nForwardsConsider starting: Naji Marshall, DALOpponents: @NOP, DEN, @GSW, @SACA depleted frontcourt has resulted in Marshall playing a lot of minutes and subsequently putting up solid production. In 13 games over the past month, Marshall has been a borderline top 70 player in standard leagues, averaging 14.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.9 three-pointers in 30.4 minutes per game. He has started in nine straight games, despite the return of Anthony Davis, and given the team's recent success, he could remain a starter for the foreseeable future. Another player with four games coming up, Marshall is worth slotting into your starting lineup, with the understanding that his overall upside is somewhat limited.Consider sitting: Jordan Walsh, BOSOpponents: IND, @IND, @PORIs the fairytale over for Walsh? While we probably don't need to go that far, his recent slump has provided managers with a sense of reality. He has scored single digits in four of the past five games, the most recent of which he failed to score a single point. During that stretch, he has averaged 8.6 points, 6.2 rebounds, 1.0 three-pointers, and 2.2 combined steals and blocks, well below what fantasy managers have come to expect. Although his spot in the starting lineup feels relatively secure, it is clear that his playing time is not. A low-volume player with only three games is definitely worth moving to the bench, in the hope that he can regain some momentum heading into the following week.Consider sitting: Noah Clowney, BKNOpponents: @PHI, @MINSomehow, Brooklyn has won five of its past eight games, with Clowney continuing to play a sizeable role. Unlike previous seasons, Clowney has been given the freedom to make mistakes without the fear of being subbed out of the game. This has resulted in his best season to date, averaging 17.3 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, and 2.8 three-pointers in 13 appearances over the past month. However, the dreaded two-game week may be just enough to sink him, at least for the next seven days. Unless you are in desperate need of points and threes, you are likely going to have other options available to you in terms of games played.\nCentersConsider starting: Isaiah Stewart, DETOpponents: @POR, @SAC, @UTA, @LACStewart's offensive production has been relatively underwhelming of late, averaging just 9.5 points per game in 13 appearances over the past month. However, during that time, he has also averaged 6.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks, keeping him firmly on the standard league radar. With four games coming up, anyone who could possibly give you 30 rebounds and 10 blocks is worth considering as a starting option. A perfect example of where Stewart could have value is if you also have Nic Claxton. Simple math would tell you that four games of Stewart likely beats out two games of Claxton.Consider sitting: Nic Claxton, BKNOpponents: @PHI, @MINAs for Claxton, he is another player who is putting together a relatively strong season, much like his teammate from earlier in the piece. Known for his ability to deliver typical big man stats, Claxton has quietly added another element to his game, tallying double-digit assists on two separate occasions thus far. Despite his encouraging play, two games are simply not enough, especially considering that Brooklyn is the only team with two games. In most situations, giving him the week off makes a lot of sense.\n            ",

That trend continued during their Week 16 loss to the Tennessee Titans as quarterback Gardner Minshew -- who started the game in placed of injured starter Patrick Mahomes -- sustained a knee injury that led to him missing the majority of the game. While it was initially feared that he had suffered a torn ACL, Minshew's ACL is reportedly still intact. However, Minshew is still expected to miss the rest of the season, which led to the Chiefs signing fellow quarterback Shane Buechele off the Buffalo Bills' practice squad for the season's final two weeks. A former undrafted rookie, Buechele won a Super Bowl in 2023 while serving as Mahomes' backup. Minshew was replaced on Sunday by backup Chris Oladokun, who went 11 of 16 for 111 yards and was sacked four times after Minshew went to the locker room. The Titans took a 9-6 lead into intermission before pulling away for a 26-9 win. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Oladokun, 28, in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Oladokun signed three years ago after he hit waivers. His only previous regular season experience took place in Week 18 of the 2024 season. He had never thrown a pass in a regular season game prior to Sunday. \nMinshew, 29, is in his first season with the Chiefs, his fourth team over the past five seasons. He earned a Pro Bowl nod in 2023 after throwing for a career-high 3,305 yards in 13 starts with the Indianapolis Colts. \nMahomes sustained a season-ending knee injuring during the loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14 that knocked Kansas City out of postseason contention. This season marks the first time since 2014 that the Chiefs will not be in the playoffs. \nThe Chiefs fell to 6-9 with Sunday's loss and will round out the season with a home game against the Denver Broncos on Christmas and a road game against the Las Vegas Raiders. \n            \n    ",

The league said the hit violated a rule that prohibits \"using any part of the helmet or facemask to butt or make forcible contact to an opponent's head or neck area.\" Perryman plans to appeal the suspension, per multiple reports. \nPerryman, 33, served a three-game suspension during the 2023 season for impermissible use of the helmet. He has been fined four times during his career for either impermissible use of the helmet or roughing the passer. Those fines have totaled over $206,500 in lost salary. Perryman will miss the Chargers' final two regular season games -- a home game against the Houston Texans on Saturday and a Week 18 road game against the Denver Broncos -- before being eligible for reinstatement for the first round of the postseason. Those last two regular season games have major playoff implications for Los Angeles. At 11-4, the Chargers are currently one game behind the Broncos for first place in the AFC West standings and holding onto the fifth seed in the AFC playoff standings. \nPerryman's spot in the starting lineup will likely be filled by Troy Dye, a six-year veteran who has already made five starts this season. In 14 games, Dye has 55 tackles with one sack, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. \n            \n    ",

    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Ravens' playoff hopes took quite a shot on Sunday night, as they fell to 7-8 with a 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. In addition to the Patriots clinching a playoff spot, a main headline from this matchup was Ravens star quarterback Lamar Jackson exiting in the second quarter with a back injury and not returning. On Monday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson has a back contusion -- or a bruise. \"Painful, certainly,\" Harbaugh said. \"Saw him in here getting treatment this morning and this afternoon, early. He's been classified as day-to-day on that, nothing beyond the contusion but I don't want to minimize the severity and pain level of that, because it's legit.\" Jackson struggled to walk out of the locker room after speaking with reporters, according to the Ravens' official website. The two-time MVP was injured on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from Patriots safety Craig Woodson. After the game, Jackson admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game. \"It's BS, bro,\" Jackson said. \"I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.\"\nJackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Tyler Huntley replaced Jackson under center, and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.\"My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,\" Jackson said. \"Pain. It hurts. [It] hurts.\"\n        \n            \n                NFL Week 16 playoff picture: Three teams punch tickets after Colts' loss; Panthers seize NFC South lead\n                \n                    Tyler Sullivan                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMore tests will be completed, but Jackson hopes to start against the Green Bay Packers next Saturday in what is a must-win game for Baltimore. Even if Jackson starts, the Ravens haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know in recent years. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later. Previously, Jackson was 16-0.\nAccording to SportsLine, the Ravens have a 5.8% chance to win the AFC North, while the 9-6 Pittsburgh Steelers have a 94.2% chance to hold onto their division lead. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        While the brief return of Philip Rivers is clearly about more than a paycheck, he is nonetheless being financially compensated during his NFL comeback with the Indianapolis Colts. Rivers, who made $244 million during his first 17 seasons in the NFL, is making a prorated veteran minimum of $278,889 for the final weeks of the 2025 season. Rivers' return also restarted his five-year NFL heath insurance coverage. Not a bad deal for a 44-year-old father of 10 and grandfather of one who had not played a down of professional football in nearly five years. Rivers has a chance to further cash in on his comeback if he can lead the Colts to the playoffs. Players on wildcard teams receive $49,500, while players on division championship teams will earn an additional $54,500, which is the same amount players receive if their teams advance to the divisional round of the playoffs. Players whose teams reach the conference championship receive an additional $77,000. The Super Bowl runner-up earns $96,000, and players on the team that wins Super Bowl LX will rake in $171,000. \nAs noted above, Rivers' return to the gridiron is not financially motivated. A high school football coach since his initial retirement from the NFL, Rivers hopes that his comeback can serve as inspiration. \"There is doubt, and it's real,\" Rivers said following the Colts' Week 15 loss to Seattle. \"The guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is, 'Shoot, let's see what happens.' I hope in that sense that can be a positive to some young boys, or young people.\"Given the circumstances, Rivers' season debut was largely a success. He went 18 of 27 for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception as the Colts nearly upset the Seahawks in Seattle. Rivers also came away from the game largely unscathed. \nRivers hopes to push the ball downfield more on on Monday night against a San Francisco 49ers team that -- like the Colts -- is fighting for playoff spot. \"I don't feel any really limitations pushing the ball down the field,\" he said. \"Am I gonna throw it 60 yards? No, but I can't name many times I ever did that anyway. But if you get it out on time in the things that we can do, I don't think that there's like, 'Oh, we can't call this, or we can't call that.' It'll be a solid plan that the staff puts together and and we'll have a great week of practice and go out and execute.\"LIVE updates: Follow along with all the action as the Colts battle the 49ers on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Major League Baseball's offseason is likely to hit a lull over the coming days, as front office personnel around the league observe the holiday season. But there's still enough time left for teams to cross some last-minute items off their list. Sunday alone saw the White Sox ink Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami and the Red Sox acquire first baseman Willson Contreras in a four-player trade. What will Monday bring? Below, CBS Sports has compiled all the day's news and moves in one place.   \tReds, White Sox talking Robert The Reds and White Sox are again discussing a trade that would send center fielder Luis Robert Jr. to Cincinnati, reports the Cincinnati Enquirer. Chicago is said to be willing to eat money, perhaps as much as half the $20 million Robert is owed in 2026, to facilitate a trade. The Reds are deep in young pitching, something the White Sox are said to want in return. \nRobert, 28, has had back-to-back disappointing years at the plate, though he remains a strong defender and top-flight baserunner. He's two years removed from hitting 38 home runs, and center fielders who can do that are rare. The Reds and White Sox have previously discussed a Robert trade on several occasions, including last offseason and again at the July trade deadline. We ranked Robert as the No. 22 trade candidate entering the offseason.   \tMariners bring in Refsnyder  Platoon corner outfielder Rob Refsnyder is joining the Mariners on a one-year contract, the team announced. The deal is worth $6.25 million, per The Athletic. Refsnyder, 34, has spent the last four years as a lefty masher with the Red Sox, posting a .923 OPS against southpaws from 2022-25. That figured dropped to a .670 OPS against righties.  \nThe Mariners have three right-handed hitting outfielders (Randy Arozarena, Victor Robles, Julio Rodríguez), though Dominic Canzone is expected to get most of the DH at-bats, and he's a left-handed hitter. Barring additional moves, Refsnyder is in line to platoon with Canzone and get at-bats spread around DH and the two corner outfield spots.   We ranked Refsnyder as the 43rd-best free agent available this offseason.  \n  Red Sox still want Bregman back  The Red Sox intend to add more offense to their roster even after the aforementioned Contreras acquisition -- and retaining third baseman Alex Bregman continues to be a priority, per The Athletic.   \nBregman, 31, posted a 128 OPS+ and 3.5 Wins Above Replacement last season in 114 games with the Red Sox. He then opted out of what was technically a three-year pact but spiritually a series of one-year arrangements. Bregman would slot back in at third base, with the Red Sox sorting through their collection of young infielders to determine their second baseman.   Bregman is also of interest to the Diamondbacks, Blue Jays, Cubs, and Tigers.    \tPirates chasing more bats after Lowe trade  The Red Sox aren't alone in trying to double-dip on bats. The Pirates added second baseman Brandon Lowe on Friday, and yet that hasn't stopped them from chasing after more bats. Instead, they have had several virtual meetings with Japanese infielder Kazuma Okamoto, per the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  CBS Sports ranked Okamoto as the 22nd-best free agent available this winter. Here's what we wrote:  \nOkamoto isn't as famous or as exciting as his countryman Munetaka Murakami, but he has a better hit tool and he should find a MLB home after hitting .327/.416/.598 with 15 home runs and as many walks as strikeouts in 69 games. There are always concerns about how NPB batters will fare against MLB-caliber velocity. Okamoto is no exception in that regard. Add in the possibility that he's viewed as just a first baseman (a right-handed-hitting one at that) and he could have a limited market. Still, it's worth acknowledging that some models, like this component-based one created by former Marlins front office analyst Bradley Woodrum, have Okamoto as the best bet among NPB bats to hit in MLB. \t \tOkamoto's posting window is set to close on Jan. 4.  \n            ",

    "body": "\n        After spending 62 years in Kansas City, Missouri, the Chiefs have announced that they are moving to Kansas after the team made a deal to build a new football stadium with the help of government tax revenue. On Monday, a committee of top Kansas lawmakers approved the subsidy deal with the Chiefs. The Legislative Coordinating Council, after meeting in executive session to hear the details of the deal in secret, voted unanimously to \"approve the STAR bond and STAR bond district for the sport stadium to support the Kansas City Chiefs.\"\"We have entered into an agreement with the State of Kansas to host Chiefs football beginning with the 2031 NFL season,\" Chiefs chairman and CEO Clark Hunt said in a statement. \"In the years ahead, we look forward to designing and building a state-of-the-art domed stadium and mixed-use district in Wyandotte County, and a best-in-class training facility, team headquarters, and mixed-use district in Olathe, totaling a minimum of $4 billion of development in the State of Kansas.\"Clark said that the move and building of the new stadium will be a \"benefit to the entire region.\" \"A stadium of this caliber will put Kansas City in the running for Super Bowls, Final Fours, and other world-class events,\" he said. \"A brand new training facility and headquarters will allow the Chiefs to continue to attract top talent. And the vision for a new mixed-use district will rival that of any sports-anchored development anywhere in the country.\"\nFounded in 1960, the franchise moved from Dallas to Kansas City ahead of the 1963 season. Three years later, the Chiefs played in the first Super Bowl and three years after that won the final Super Bowl prior to the AFL-NFL merger. In 2019, the franchise broke its 50-year drought without a championship after defeating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV. Since then, the Chiefs have won two more Super Bowls while appearing in two others. Last season, the Chiefs joined the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots as the only franchises to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls. \"Of course, it will be difficult to bid farewell to Arrowhead Stadium in a few years,\" Hunt said. \"Like so many of you, Arrowhead reminds me of family memories and unforgettable moments. But the truth is, what makes Chiefs gamedays so special is you. Seats don't make noise, concrete doesn't intimidate opponents, parking lots don't cook barbecue. You do. \n\"From the day the Chiefs came to Kansas City, you have energized this team, and this team has elevated the profile of the city and the region. It's the reason kids from coast to coast wear red and gold t-shirts, and sports fans around the world will watch soccer games from our backyard this summer. This next step will further elevate the entire region in the eyes of the country and the world.\" \n            ",

    "body": "\n        One of Nick Saban's forgotten coaching disciples prior to his magical two-year run at Indiana, Curt Cignetti credits the Alabama legend with helping him set up his own process behind the scenes as the leader of a program while instituting principles that have led to sizable wins.As the anchor of the top-seeded and unbeaten Hoosiers entering next week's College Football Playoff quarterfinal matchup with the Crimson Tide at the Rose Bowl, Cignetti has not forgotten his early roots in the coaching ranks.\"[He's a] real important part of my journey,\" Cignetti said Monday. \"[I] learned a lot from Coach Saban in terms of organization and standards. I wouldn't be where I am today without my time under Nick. My family really enjoyed Tuscaloosa.\"Cut from the same no BS cloth as Saban, Cignetti reportedly flourished in a \"sink-or-swim environment\" as an assistant coach and recruiting advisor at Alabama in 2007 and it was there he saw what turned out to be the makings of an eventual college football dynasty.\nIn fact, it was Cignetti who was the lead recruiter for future Alabama Heisman winner Mark Ingram, the running back who helped the Crimson Tide to the first of six national titles under Saban in 2009.\"He was knowledgeable about recruiting and knew everybody on the board because he was sending us out,\" former Alabama running backs coach Burton Burns told CBS Sports' John Talty last year. \"He was built for the job, it was in his DNA. He knew how to do all those things. He was really good on the road. I went on the road a few times with him, and he was really good with coaches and the family of those kids.\"Alabama was Cignetti's third coaching stop in the Power conference ranks and he spent five years on Saban's offensive staff before becoming a head coach for the first time at IUP in 2011. After turning that program around and finding success at Elon and James Madison, Indiana took a chance of Cignetti ahead of the 2024 campaign and he's done the rest.\nCignetti's won 24 of his first 26 games with the Hoosiers entering the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl and pushed Indiana to its first outright Big Ten title since 1945 this season. Cignetti has another Heisman winner to boot in quarterback Fernando Mendoza, whom he plucked out of the transfer portal from California last cycle and has watched the 6-foot-5 junior throw for 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns this fall.The transfer portal has been Cignetti's primary strength at Indiana, according to Saban.\"I think when you're having that many changes on your roster every year, you have to do a fantastic job of evaluation, which Curt Cignetti has done that so far,\" Saban said earlier this season on College GameDay. \"I don't think you could change a program as quickly as he has Indiana, especially one that doesn't have a tradition of success and culture as a football program without transfer portal.\n\"We need new players, quick players. We need to be able to do this quickly. And he brought a bunch of players from his old school that knew his culture and how he wanted to do it. And got a quarterback in there that could make some plays. Now he has an even better quarterback, in my opinion.\"On the heels of consecutive top-30 portal signing classes where player evaluation was paramount, Cignetti says his sales pitch at Indiana is unique -- and awfully blunt.\"I used to tell them everybody can't play for the Yankees, man,\" Cignetti said earlier this season. \"I mean, that's the way it is. So don't come here if this is not what you want to do, because the standard is high. The commitment has got to be high.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        DK Metcalf's physical confrontation with a Detroit Lions fan Sunday will see him miss the rest of the regular season and forfeit more than $555,000 in salary. But the impact could go beyond that. The two-game suspension for what the NFL terms \"conduct detrimental\" to the league now voids at least $45 million in future guaranteed money for the Pittsburgh Steelers receiver. Metcalf would still be able to earn that money over the next two years.His four-year, $132 million contract from March, reviewed by CBS Sports, notes that if he \"fails… to practice or play with the Club for any reason,\" which includes \"Player's suspension by the NFL or Club for Conduct Detrimental,\" his guarantees \"will be NULL AND VOID.\"Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at a Lions fan during the first half of Pittsburgh's eventual 29-24 win Sunday. Metcalf reportedly had prior history with the fan when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. \nMetcalf plans to appeal his two-game suspension, which will be heard by either commissioner Roger Goodell or one of his designees. Even if Metcalf's suspension is reduced to one game, his contract guarantees would still automatically void.Metcalf's 2026 salary of $25 million was previously fully guaranteed. Should he be suspended at least one game, that guarantee will void. But it is extremely unlikely the Steelers would part ways with Metcalf before the 2026 season after sending Seattle a second-round pick for him in the spring for who is now their top receiver. He would still be eligible to earn every dollar of his salary next season and beyond regardless of its guaranteed status.The voided guarantees are more important in 2027 when $20 million in salary has been injury-protected. If Metcalf suffered a major injury in the 2026 season that kept him from passing a physical in March 2027, he would be guaranteed $20 million for that upcoming season. If the suspension holds, that guarantee goes away -- which would give the Steelers a potential financial out after two seasons should they wish or need to use it.\nWith this many millions at stake, it is no wonder Metcalf will appeal the ruling handed down Monday by the league. But the same league that issued the punishment will hear the appeal, unlike how players suspended for actions like unnecessary roughness have their appeals heard by officers who are jointly appointed by the NFL and NFL Players Association.Should this end Metcalf's season, the 28-year-old would have the least productive year of his career. His 59 receptions are the fewest since his 2019 rookie season, and his 850 yards would be his least in his seven seasons.\n        \n            \n                Steelers' DK Metcalf had prior history with Lions fan he had confrontation with, per report\n                \n                    Jordan Dajani                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMeanwhile, the Steelers can clinch the AFC North this weekend before even playing Sunday against the Browns. If the Ravens lose to the Packers on Saturday, or if the Steelers beat the Browns on Sunday, Pittsburgh clinches the division and the fourth seed in the AFC playoffs.\n            ",

Interim coach Biff Poggi did not shy away from calling out Michigan for its lengthy list of recent issues, calling it a \"malfunctioning organization\" when meeting with reporters Monday.The latest troubles from inside Schembechler Hall came after Michigan fell under the NCAA's watchful eye for recruiting violations and the sign-stealing operation that occurred under former coach Jim Harbaugh. While Moore's scandal was an individual case rather than a systemic bending of the rules, it added to the already tarnished reputation of a program that has been in the news for all the wrong reasons since its 2023 national championship.\"It has been five years of -- let's just call it what it is -- a malfunctioning organization where there's something every year,\" Poggi said. \"The athletic director has made it very clear he doesn't want any more of that. If I am named the coach, which I don't know if I am, there will be a massive self-examination of what's happened in this building. And you can expect a lot of changes.\"Michigan authorized an investigation into its athletic department's handling of the Moore situation. Chicago-based law firm Jenner & Block will conduct a comprehensive review of the entire department, and CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello reports that the investigation is \"open-ended\" to the point that Michigan is unsure what it might uncover.\nInterim university president Domenico Grasso said Michigan is willing to \"act swiftly\" if findings from the investigation warrant more terminations.\"We will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that conduct like this does not happen again,\" Grasso said. \"Make no mistake. We will leave no stone unturned, and any further action we take will be based on credible evidence and findings, developed through a rigorous investigation.\"Not only did Moore's two-year tenure come to a close because of his impermissible conduct with a staffer, but he also faces an active show-cause penalty for his involvement in the Wolverines' sign-stealing operation. A separate case implicated former co-offensive coordinator Matt Weiss for illegally accessing private information on campus. Another involved Harbaugh, who was investigated for making contact with recruits during a dead period amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"Everything that happens in this building has to be reevaluated, quite frankly, because it is not up to standard,\" Poggi said. \"The staff has to be reevaluated. I mean the coaches, I mean the analysts, I mean everybody in the building has to be evaluated.\"Biff Poggi seeks full-time job, vows to make changesThe Wolverines are in the midst of a coaching search, and one of the factors they will undoubtedly consider in identifying a new leader is his ability to stabilize a program that has been in hot water for the better part of this decade. Poggi made his case for the full-time job and emphasized his desire to do just that.\"This place is magical,\" Poggi said. \"The program means a lot to me. It's one of the things I want to fix before I go smoke myself to death with cigars. It's one of the things I want to fix. I want to fix this program.\"\n\n        \n            \n                Biff Poggi emerges as realistic -- but risky -- option for Michigan as administration appears in flux\n                \n                    Richard Johnson                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nPoggi last held a head coaching role at Charlotte during the 2023 and 2024 seasons. In his lone tenure as an FBS headman, he went 6-16 with the 49ers and never won more than three games in a campaign. He did fare better this year when he handled the duties during Moore's two-game suspension, though, and received credit for the Wolverines' victories over Central Michigan and Nebraska.Serving as Michigan's leader in an interim capacity sparked Poggi's interest in manning the duties in a permanent capacity. That interest appears to be mutual.\"I'm being considered,\" Poggi said. \"I've had multiple interviews, multiple conversations. Nobody knows what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen. I just appreciate being considered, and we'll see what happens.\"\nPoggi will coach Michigan against Texas in the Citrus Bowl on Dec. 31. \n            ",

Once Olivia Borsutzki and Esra Kurban realized two cars had been swallowed by the concrete while waiting at a red light, they left their respective vehicles to help those trapped.\"I was still in the car and I saw a man in a hole,\" Borsutzki told On3. \"I was like, 'I need to help.' Nobody was helping.\" When a sedan and pickup truck surprisingly sunk into the earth, the vehicles closest to the sinkhole backed away in case the hole expanded. Borsutzki and Kurban did the opposite and ran towards the danger to help the trapped drivers. Authorities said no one was injured during this wild incident, but check out what happened, here:\nThe Metropolitan Utilities District said that \"it is too early to attribute the cause to any single source,\" according to KETV, but the incident also included a water main break.Borsutzki said that after the clip went viral, her teammates and Omaha staff began to recognize her and Kurban. Borsutzki also said her strength coach texted her, \"Very strong, big dog.\"\"My dad told me that could have been really bad … ,\" Borsutzki said. \"In the moment it was just adrenaline. We just wanted to help.\"\nIt was a good week for the Omaha Mavericks, as they defeated Oral Roberts on Wednesday, 84-75. It was a historic victory in which freshman Regan Juenemann dropped 40 points, while Sarai Estupiñan scored 30 points. There was also Avril Smith, who grabbed a whopping 23 rebounds. According to OptaSTATS, this Omaha trio was the first NBA, WNBA and Division I men's or women's trio to include a 40-point scorer, a 30-point scorer and a player that recorded 20 rebounds in a single game in the last 15 years.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        NBA Hall of Famer and Miami Heat legend Chris Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" after a recent health scare. Bosh revealed Wednesday in a video posted to social media that he woke up covered in his own blood. Bosh, who is still recovering from the ordeal, said the incident occurred when he was getting ready for a date with his wife.\"Next thing you know, I was on the ground,\" Bosh said. Bosh doesn't remember anything other than waking up covered in his own blood. He declined to offer specifics about what exactly caused the medical event, but did go into further detail on his Substack, \"The Last Chip.\"\"I was walking from my closet into the bathroom, getting ready for an evening out, when my body turned on me,\" Bosh wrote. \"A numbing sensation shot down my left leg, that sharp, electric feeling you get when you bump your funny bone. Before I knew it, I was on the floor. I slowly came to in a pool of my own blood while my wife frantically spoke with 911. I tried to move my body the way I always had, and it didn't respond.\"\nBosh explained how the \"terrifying\" moment helped change his outlook on life.\n\"After coming back from the darkness, there was no euphoric clarity,\" Bosh wrote. \"... What did change was an immediate outlook on life that was simpler and more honest.\"Bosh retired from the NBA in 2019 after not having played since 2016 due to another health-related issue. Bosh suffered from recurring blood clots that cut his career short. It was first discovered in 2015, when a blood clot that started in his leg and traveled to one of his lungs ended his season after just 44 games. He returned the following season (2015-16), but a second blood clot was found, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season after playing 53 games.After several medical evaluations, Heat team doctors failed Bosh on his physical ahead of the 2016-17 decision despite his desire to play. It was determined that it would be too dangerous for him to continue his basketball career. He retired at 31, having won two championships with the Heat and earning 11 All-Star selections. In 2019, the Heat retired his jersey after playing six of his 13 years with the team. Bosh was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.Bosh said he's \"lucky to be alive\" and plans to use this moment to share his experiences with others.\n\"This experience motivated me to start writing again, to share my experiences and stories in the hope that we can get something out of it and grow together,\" Bosh wrote.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The New York Giants could be preparing to part ways with a former first-round pick. The team is listening to offers for edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux, and the belief among teams at the NFL Scouting Combine is that Thibodeaux will get dealt, according to SNY.Thibodeaux, 25, is coming off a season during which he recorded just 2.5 sacks, five tackles for loss and nine quarterback hits while playing in only 10 of 17 games. He has fallen off precipitously over the last two years after he posted an 11.5-sack season in 2023, his second year in the NFL.But even that 11.5-sack total was not really representative of his level of play that year. Thibodeaux ranked 12th in the NFL in sacks that season but checked in just 67th in pressures and 107th in pressure rate out of the 145 players who rushed the passer 250 times or more. He just happened to have a sack-to-pressure ratio that was an outlier and looks nothing like the one he has posted in the other three seasons of his career. During that 2023 season, 26.7% of Thibodeaux's pressures resulted in sacks. He has otherwise been at 10% (2022), 14.5% (2024) and 7.8% (2025). It's no surprise, then, that he's totaled only 12 sacks in his three non-2023 seasons.\nThat subpar performance could lead to a reduced market for Thibodeau's services. There's also the matter of his fully guaranteed salary of around $14.8 million in 2026, which could even further limit said market. Still, as a 25-year-old former first-round pick, there are teams out there that could be interested. Let's take a look at a few that might make some sense, if the price is right.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Francisco 49ersOnly two teams generated pressure at a lower rate during the 2025 regular season than the 49ers, according to Tru Media. (That would be the Jets and the Panthers.) San Francisco losing Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams to injury during the season played a role, but the Niners still need more help on the edge even after you account for getting those guys back. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Buffalo BillsThe Bills are seemingly on the hunt for help on the edges every offseason, and this one could be no different. They had a solid pressure rate during the regular season, but in the playoffs it dropped to just 32.5% -- and 28% in the loss to the Broncos in the divisional round. Buffalo has other needs and might be turned off by price, but if it's low enough, it could get interested.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York JetsThe Jets are one of those aforementioned teams that did an even worse job of getting after the quarterback than the 49ers. They could use all they help they can get, so you might as well throw them in the mix here. That's especially true after they traded Jermaine Johnson II to the Titans. They also have plenty of cap space, so they could likely make something happen if they wanted.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ChargersKhalil Mack and Odafe Oweh will hit free agency this offseason, and the Chargers might not be able to bring both of them back. They are scheduled to have over $80 million in cap room, though, so if they wanted to get in on the action for Thibodeaux, they could probably do so at a lower cost than other teams that might want the Giants to absorb some of his cap hit.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Indianapolis ColtsThe Colts ranked just 23rd in pressure rate during the 2025 season, according to Tru Media. They need someone to rush the passer opposite Laiatu Latu, who collected 8.5 sacks this past year. They've been looking for pass rush help for a while, and they could be interested in buying low here -- especially if the Giants are willing to eat some of the salary.\n            ",

Although the Magic are a significantly tougher team than these two, Houston's offensive success could carry over on Thursday in Orlando. The Magic are 25-32 against the spread this season, and the Rockets are 36-21 overall entering a contest where they only need to win by two points to cover the number. Houston center Alperen Sengun had a triple-double with 26 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists on Wednesday, and he'll be a matchup nightmare against for Orlando, which returns home after a cross-country flight and a 110-109 win over the Lakers on Tuesday. The model projects the Rockets to cover in 65% of simulations. Back the Rockets at DraftKings here:Michigan State vs. Purdue: Over 142.5 total points (-105)The Over has hit in six of the last seven Michigan State games and in three of the last four Purdue contests, including back-to-back games, entering Thursday. Five of Michigan State's last seven games have gone Over 142.5 total points as well, and all three of Purdue's recent Overs had at least 143 combined points scored. These are trends the model projects to continue on Thursday as these top-15 ranked teams go head-to-head, with the Over hitting in 77% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:South Dakota State (-11.5) vs. Kansas City (-110)\"It's one thing to be 4-24 and on a 12-game losing streak as Kansas City is, but the truth is that they haven't covered in any of those 12 games,\" SportsLine expert Eric Cohen said. \"KenPom ranks the Roos 355th, 11th-worst in the country, but it's hard to imagine that this sad team would beat anyone below them. At 13-16, South Dakota State isn't all that great, but they did beat UMKC by 28 in mid-January. Expect another 20+ point blowout as we'll continue to ride the trend of fading Kansas City.\" Back South Dakota at DraftKings here:Want more NBA and college basketball picks on Thursday?You've seen some of the model's Thursday best bets.

The Colts met with Richardson's agent Deiric Jackson on Thursday morning and they mutually agreed that it was best for both parties to look into all available options. If his fifth-year option is not used, the 2023 No. 4 overall pick has one season left on his rookie contract.Last year, Richardson was beat out by Daniel Jones in the preseason for the starting QB job. With the former New York Giants quarterback expected to be the starter again, Richardson's future with the Colts can best be described as uncertain.Richardson's career has been defined by injuries. The 23-year-old has been with the Colts for three seasons but has only appeared in 17 games with 15 starts.In his first year with the team, Richardson played just four games, going 2-2 with 577 yards, three touchdowns, one interception, 136 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground. An injury to his throwing shoulder ended his rookie season prematurely.\nHe's also dealt with hip, back and foot injuries that caused him to miss a total of three games in 2024.Last October, during warmups ahead of their Week 6 game, Richardson sustained an orbital fracture that required surgery after a freak accident with a stretching band. The injury caused him to miss 12 games last season, but according to ESPN, doctors \"indicate his vision has been restored.\"This week, Colts general manager Chris Ballard said Richardson has been cleared to play football. \nRichardson certainly still has a lot of his career left and could get a fresh start with a new team. Recently the NFL has seen numerous quarterbacks struggle with one team and find a resurgence later in their career. The most recently display of this is Super Bowl champion Sam Darnold, who bounced around the league, playing for four teams before finding the ultimate success with the Seattle Seahawks.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        While he missed the entire 2025 college football season with a torn ACL, Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy remains perhaps the best cornerback prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft class, and he said he is recovered from the injury that held him out during his final year with the Volunteers. His return to full strength opens the door for a potential first-round selection even though he only has two years of college production to his name.Despite being cleared and having \"no limits\" physically, McCoy will not participate at this week's NFL Scouting Combine. He will, however, complete workouts at Tennessee's pro day. McCoy said he elected to pass on the combine because he wants more training time as he seeks to put the best product on the field.\"I was just easing into my training out of college and just trying to make sure everything was good,\" McCoy said at the combine. \"The plan from the jump was for me to do pro day, do all my medicals and stuff to show that I'm healthy.\"McCoy's medicals are one of the biggest storylines at the combine. If all checks out, he could very well be one of the first defensive players taken in April's draft. Any concern over his knee would be grounds for a slide down the board.\nThe cautious approach McCoy took in 2025 could pay off in the form of ideal medical evaluation results. He said he made a push to get back onto the field last season at Tennessee, but while he was cleared to return, he did not feel ready to compete. That did not stop him from declaring for the draft, though, and the film he produced over one year at Tennessee and another at Oregon State is enough to warrant first-round projections.\"I got back to training, and I just felt like myself again,\" McCoy said. \"I made a big impact the year that I played. I just felt like I was ready.\"McCoy debuted as a true freshman in 2023 and played in all 12 regular-season games at Oregon State. He was an immediate standout for the Beavers and hauled in two interceptions and a fumble recovery on what was a pleasant surprise of a campaign for the former three-star recruit. That season made him a prized prospect in the 2024 transfer portal, and he made the leap to the SEC with high expectations.\nMcCoy delivered on the buzz with a splendid first year at Tennessee, doubling his interception total with four takeaways in 2024. He broke up an additional nine passes in what ended up being his final year on the college gridiron.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        If anyone on the San Francisco 49ers' roster has a fear of flying, they might want to go ahead and ask for a trade, because no team will be flying more during the 2026 season than the 49ers. Not only will the team be opening the season in Australia against the Rams, but the 49ers will also be headed to Mexico City in December. Thanks to those two international trips, the 49ers could end up traveling more than 38,100 miles in 2026, which would be the most ever for a team during a regular season in NFL history.Although the 49ers will have a brutal travel schedule this year, there is a trade-off involved. According to general manager John Lynch, the NFL is going to help the team out by giving them a more favorable travel schedule later in the year. \"We've talked with the league and the league has assured us they'll give us the grace on the back end [of the schedule], things that we're not going to go into, but in terms of scheduling, to help ease that burden,\" Lynch told NBC Sports Bay Area this week. \n\n        \n            \n                Jets-Titans trade grades: New York deals Jermaine Johnson to Tennessee for T'Vondre Sweat\n                \n                    Shanna McCarriston                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSo what does that mean? As you just read, Lynch wouldn't go into specific details, but it sounds like the 49ers are going to have a favorable late season schedule and it could end up looking a lot like what they got in 2025. Last season, the 49ers got the latest bye possible (Week 14) and then they closed out the season by playing three of their final four games at home. The 49ers were one of just two teams that played three of four at home to close out the year AND also got to play at home in both Week 17 and Week 18 (The Bengals were the other team). The 49ers went 3-1 in their final four games last year and had a chance to clinch the No. 1 overall seed at home against the Seahawks in Week 18. The 49ers would probably love to see something like that again and it wouldn't be surprising it if happens based on Lynch's comments. The 49ers game in Mexico will be played in either Week 13 or Week 14, so the NFL could send the 49ers to Mexico City in Week 13, give them a Week 14 bye and then have them play three of four games at home to close out the season. Since the Mexico game is technically a home game, that means the 49ers would only have to play one true road game over the final six weeks of the season. Even if the NFL gives the 49ers a friendly schedule late in the season, the team is still going to be traveling a lot in 2026 and Lynch is well aware of that. \n\"It's part of another challenge. I think we will set a record for the amount of travel in a year -- it seems like I've heard that -- but we always travel a lot,\" Lynch said. \"It just got a little bit more because of the distance of Australia. Part of it is exciting. We'll embrace it, make the most of it. We'll be smart about the way we approach it.\"With the 49ers playing in Australia, that means they'll be traveling more than 38,100 miles in 2026, which COULD set the NFL record for most miles traveled, but it might not. On top of playing two international games, the 49ers also have two cross-country trips with games at Atlanta and at New York against the Giants. If the NFL combined those two games into one road trip, that would shave almost 4,000 miles off San Francisco's travel schedule, and in that case, they wouldn't break the all-time travel record. The travel record is currently held by the 2025 Chargers, who traveled just over 37,000 miles last year (For 2026, the Rams are also playing in Australia, but their current travel estimate is only expected to be about 35,000 miles). \nLynch understands why the 49ers are being sent out of the country for two games, but it's still something that won't be easy to deal with. \"The league tends to put the teams [in these games] that they want to showcase,\" Lynch said. \"Part of you should be flattered. I've never been to Australia. I don't know that I necessarily wanted to go there for a football game, but we're going and I'm excited to go.\"The NFL will be playing a record-setting nine international games in 2026 and the 49ers will be making history by becoming the first team ever to play two international games in non-consecutive weeks. \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Cristiano Ronaldo acquired a 25% stake in Spanish club Almeria, the Ballon d'Or winner announced Thursday, marking his latest venture as an investor in a club.Ronaldo made the acquisition through his newly formed holding company, CR7 Sports Investments, and his portfolio includes a stake in Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr, a club he has played for since 2023. The majority of Almeria is still owned by Saudi consortium SMC Group led by Mohamed al-Khereiji, who took over the club in May of last year and currently serves as the president.Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\"It has been a long-time ambition of mine to contribute to football,\" Ronaldo said in a statement from CR7 Sports Investments. \"I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club's next phase of growth.\"\nKhereiji suggested in a statement issued by Almeria that Ronaldo would take interest in the club's youth setup, while Rubi, coach of the second division team, said the Portugal international's influence could be wider.\"From our perspective, we're very happy,\" he said. \"Of course, we welcome him. I think it's great news because someone like him, with his extensive knowledge of sport and football, can really help a club like ours. It's very exciting for the whole club, the city, and the province. Everyone knows the good relationship Cristiano has with the owners. You find out things as they happen, but I don't think it's important when I found out or not. The important thing is that he's arrived here to join us [as a shareholder]. We're very happy.\"Almeria currently sit third in the Segunda Division, one point outside of the top two spots that guarantee automatic promotion to LaLiga but nestled securely inside the playoff spots for teams ranked third through sixth. The team last competed in Spain's top flight during the 2023-24 season, when they finished 19th with just 21 points from 38 matches and were relegated.\nThe team's best-ever LaLiga finish was eighth place, which came in the 2007-08 season as a newly-promoted side. Current Aston Villa coach Unai Emery was at the helm at the time and Alvaro Negredo, a future Euro winner with Spain and Premier League champion with Manchester City, was their leading goalscorer.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Premier League chief executive Richard Masters warned that the sport \"cannot rely\" on star players to maintain their level of performance amid an expanding football calendar that he believes leaves domestic competitions in need of protection.Star players such as Chelsea's Cole Palmer, described as shattered by the head of English footballers' union, find themselves in a position where they may be playing in major tournaments in three straight summers, the 2026 World Cup coming on the back of a Club World Cup in the United States last summer and the European Championships in the previous year.During the regular season, the toll on top talent has been somewhat increased by the addition of at least two more games for clubs competing in the Champions League and Europa League, to say nothing of the strain placed on those who compete in an even more competitive Premier League. \"The players at the top level play an enormous number of football matches, and we cannot rely on them to keep performing at the level we want them to,\" said Masters at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit. \"What I never want [is] any of our clubs [thinking] that the Premier League isn't their number one priority or for the players to fill the Premier League isn't the number one priority, because they have too many other matches to distract them. 'I'm gonna take a breather this week. I'm prioritizing myself for another competition.' \n\"At the moment, the Premier League is number one, I believe, for all of our clubs, and that's what keeps it strong. We want that to remain the case, both in terms of the managers, the shareholders, and also the players.\"The expansion of European games has had a knock-on effect on an English football calendar that already allowed itself little room for maneuver with logistical nightmares created in recent seasons when those competing on the continent go deep in the EFL Cup. In April 2024, English Football Association was also forced to scrap replays in the FA Cup from the first round onwards, the governing body specifically citing UEFA competitions as a contributory factor to the decision.For Masters' part, he noted that it has become increasingly difficult to schedule Premier League games around clubs' other involvement. That reality is not aided by the remarkable success of England on the continent. At the time of writing, all nine clubs that qualified for the competitions are still active, including six of the remaining 16 teams in the Champions League.\n\"It's a serious concern,\" said Masters of the expanding calendar. \"What we're seeing is continued expansion of regional and international football. In the last 2 years alone, we've seen the relaunching of the UC3 programme with many more European games our clubs are on our participating in. We've seen a Club World Cup launched and we're seeing a much bigger World Cup this summer. All of those decisions, many are unconsulted on, particularly at FIFA level. [With] UEFA, we have that dialogue, not so we agree with all of it, and we're now starting to feel some of that. \"It is incredibly hard to schedule the Premier League to meet all of our broadcast obligations, to keep all of our clubs happy at the same time, as accommodating nine clubs in Europe. It's a real problem. Um, so we have to be aware of that and we have to work very closely ... with UEFA or you have to stay close as leagues because these don't just impact the Premier League, they impact on all of us.\"Domestic competitions need protection. We're going to see the new expanding World Cup in all of its glory. We're looking forward to that. The World Cup is a great thing. Obviously, it's become controversial. We're gonna see how it's all gonna pan out over the summer.\"\nMasters' concerns were echoed by Maheta Molango, chair of English footballers' union, the PFA, and a vice-president on its worldwide counterpart FIFPRO. He specifically cited the case of Palmer, who has been limited to 19 of a possible 42 club games this season as he battles with groin issues and a broken toe. In the previous season, Palmer played 4,247 minutes across 52 matches for Chelsea alone in a season that ran from August 18 2024 to July 13 the following year and the Club World Cup final. That in itself had begun barely a month after a European Championships in which Palmer scored in the final.Molango revealed that he had visited Chelsea's training camp soon after their Club World Cup exertions and that the club had seemed \"shattered.\" \"This is just the reality,\" he said. \"You wonder whether this is what we wanted as an industry. I'm not sure. I think sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.\n\"People say he's a millionaire, yeah, he is, but it doesn't give you an extra lung or an extra leg, and [we have] come to a stage where you know, 'I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he's the one who makes me dream.' The reality is that the fans pay right now 100% of the ticket [price], and a lot of time they get 70% if they're lucky of the show or 60% because players start regulating themselves.\"The Premier League is the best product in terms of football, they make north of £4billion for 38 games. Surely there's an element of valuing the scarcity. Christmas is nice because it's not every Tuesday and I think we need to discover that because we thought in football that more is more. Sometimes less is more.\"\n            ",

Under a new recommendation, players disqualified for targeting for the first time during the season will be allowed to play in their next game, regardless of which half the targeting penalty occurs. Under the current rule, a player disqualified in the second half of a game for targeting has to sit out the first half of the subsequent game. If the rule changes, any player disqualified for targeting for a second time during the season would miss the first half of their next game. A third disqualification for targeting would result in the offending player being suspended for their next game in full. \"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said rules subcommittee chair A.J. Edds in a statement. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n        \n            \n                NCAA to discuss targeting rule changes, could make penalty 'less punitive' for 2026 college football season\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe proposal also allows for a conference to initiate an appeals process following a player's second targeting violation. If the appeal is successful, then the player would be allowed to play both halves in their next game. \nThe proposal still has to pass both the FBS and FCS Oversight Committees before it is made official. Both committees are set to meet in March to consider rule proposals. \n            \n",

    "body": "\n        Anthony Richardson, one of the NFL's most physically tantalizing quarterbacks, is now available via trade. The Indianapolis Colts reportedly gave the fourth overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft permission to pursue a trade. The 23-year-old was beaten out in a training camp battle with Daniel Jones last preseason, and the Colts are expected to re-sign Jones to a multi-year contract this offseason. Richardson has a small body of work across three seasons in the NFL, playing just 17 games with 15 of them being starts. A shoulder injury cut his rookie year short after four games. A combination of hip, back and foot injuries limited Richardson to 11 games and he only threw two passes in 2025. A freak eye injury he suffered in warmups prior to the Colts' Week 6 game caused an orbital fracture that necessitated surgery after an accident with a resistance band. Richardson has completed 50.6% of his passes for 2,400 yards, 11 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions in his 17 games of work.Richardson's rocket launcher right arm is why he'll certainly garner interest on the trade market: he led the NFL with a 14.4 yards per completion average in 2024. However, he's also a project as he completed just 47.7% of his passes that year, the worst completion percentage in a season since Tim Tebow completed just 46.5% of his throws for the Denver Broncos in 2011. That makes Richardson the first player to rank first in yards per completion and last in completion percentage in the same season since Heath Shuler in 1994. \n        \n            \n                Najee Harris landing spots: Super Bowl champion Seahawks among possible fits for former Pro Bowl running back\n                \n                    Bryan DeArdo                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhich teams could be interested enough to take the plunge required to trade for the former top-five pick quarterback as he enters the fourth and final season of his rookie deal? Let's take a look at five possible landing spots.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Minnesota Vikings Minnesota Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell helped revive the careers of two other former top 10 pick quarterbacks in Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones in 2024 only to see both of them walk in free agency. Darnold went on to win Super Bowl LX in his first season with the Seattle Seahawks, and Jones was in the NFL MVP conversation in the first half of the 2025 season before injuries derailed him.O'Connell let both of those guys out of his building because he had the 2024 10th overall pick in quarterback J.J. McCarthy waiting in the wings. However, his first year as an NFL starting quarterback can be described as highly concerning. McCarthy ranked dead last in the NFL in completion percentage (58%), touchdown-interception (11-12) and passer rating (72.6) in 2025 despite working with O'Connell and being able to throw passes to 2022 NFL Offensive Player of the Year wide receiver Justin Jefferson. Perhaps Minnesota would be interested in bringing in another formerly highly-touted prospect to push and/or overtake McCarthy. When mic'd up in a game in which the Vikings played the Colts, O'Connell gave Richardson an extended pep talk. The interest in Richardson could very well still exist for the Vikings now.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles RamsMatthew Stafford, the 2025 NFL MVP, is 38-years-old. He certainly isn't looking to retire in 2026 after leading the league in passing yards (4,707) and passing touchdowns (46) in 2025. However, it could be prudent for Los Angeles to begin building a contingency plan for life after Stafford. A quarterback with Richardson's eye-popping traits working with one of the NFL's top scheme lords could bring the 23-year-old's pro career back to life, and he could allow Los Angeles to not skip a beat post-Stafford after some refinement with McVay. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Pittsburgh SteelersAaron Rodgers is 42-years-old and set to be a free agent in March. The Pittsburgh Steelers need to be planning for life after Rodgers as early as 2026. Trading for Richardson and having him rebuild his fundamentals with new Steelers head coach Mike McCarthy could be an ideal situation for the 23-year-old. McCarthy famously helped Rodgers tweak his mechanics in the NFL, which helped transform him into a Super Bowl and league MVP. Perhaps McCarthy could rebuild Richardson in his \"QB school\" program, which could result in big plays downfield to two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver DK Metcalf.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Atlanta Falcons The Atlanta Falcons are loaded with offensive talent with 2025 first team All-Pro running back Bijan Robinson, former top-10 pick wide receiver Drake London and 2025 second-team All-Pro tight end Kyle Pitts. All they need is a long-term solution at the quarterback position. \nKirk Cousins is expected to be released in March, and the 2024 eighth overall pick quarterback Michael Penix Jr. suffered the third ACL tear of his football career, his first in the NFL, in Week 11 against the Carolina Panthers. Penix might not even be ready to roll for Week 1 this season. Richardson is two years younger than Penix, so he could be a tantalizing option for new head coach Kevin Stefanski and new president of football operations Matt Ryan. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Miami Dolphins The Miami Dolphins are Green Bay Packers South after hiring Green Bay defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley as their new head coach and Packers vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan as their new general manager. Both of them witnessed the rehabilitation of 2022 third-round pick quarterback Malik Willis in Green Bay across the last two seasons, and he will now be a sought-after free agent this offseason. Perhaps they will try to hit the jackpot again with an athletic quarterback project by trading for Richardson, as Tua Tagovailoa's time as the Dolphins' starting quarterback seemingly comes to an end in the near future.  \n            ",

Plus, there’s a sneaky series edge here because while Michigan might eye Ohio State or Michigan State as its primary rivals, Illinois has won nine straight against the Wolverines, a streak that dates back to Jan. 2019.\n                                    \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Oregon State men's basketball coach Wayne Tinkle will not return after the 2025-26 season, the school announced Thursday. Tinkle has the option to finish the campaign before departing from his post, but has not yet decided whether to see the season out, according to John Canzano. The Beavers are 16-14 this season and 9-8 in West Coast Conference play.Tinkle's exit comes after a 12-year run with the Beavers that featured some of the program's highest highs and lowest lows. It also coincides with Oregon State's move from the WCC back into the Pac-12, which debuts as a reconstructed conference beginning next season.Oregon State never finished higher than fourth in the Pac-12 during Tinkle's decade in the conference and concluded its first year in the WCC with a fifth-place finish. Tinkle has a 175-204 overall record for his tenure, with an 82-141 mark in conference games\"We are grateful to Wayne for his dedication to Oregon State and for the leadership he has provided our men's basketball program,\" athletic director Scott Barnes said in a statement. \"He has represented Beaver Nation with integrity and commitment. As we approach the dawn of the new Pac-12 era, we believe it is in the best interest of our men's basketball program to transition to its next chapter. These decisions are never easy, but we are focused on positioning our program for sustained success in a rapidly evolving collegiate athletics landscape.\"\nThe Tinkle era at Oregon State will be most remembered for the program's miraculous run to the 2021 Elite Eight. The Beavers entered the NCAA Tournament that season as a No. 12 seed and pulled off upsets of No. 5 Tennessee, No. 4 Oklahoma State and No. 8 Loyola Chicago before falling to No. 2 Houston. It was one of two NCAA Tournament appearances for the Beavers during Tinkle's 12 years at the helm.While the Beavers reached the postseason three times, including a trip to the College Basketball Crown last season, they also logged two of the worst seasons in program history under Tinkle's leadership. The year directly following the Elite Eight run, Oregon State went 3-28 and posted the worst winning percentage (.097) of any Beavers squad in 125 years. Tinkle also oversaw a 5-27 team in 2016-17.Oregon State making changes ahead of Pac-12 relaunchWhen the Pac-12 returns as a full conference this summer, Oregon State will be under new leadership in both football and men's basketball. The Beavers fired football coach Trent Bray midway through the 2025 season and hired Alabama co-offensive coordinator JaMarcus Shephard as his replacement.\nThe overhaul is part of the Beavers' efforts to establish themselves as top-tier contenders in the new-look league. Oregon State was long a bottom-half athletic department in the old Pac-12, but it enters the conference's new era as a potential leader across the board given its status as a recent Power Five member.\n        \n            \n                2026 Pac-12 football schedule: 'Flex week' provides unique advantage in College Football Playoff race\n                \n                    Carter Bahns                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nThe Pac-12 has the opportunity to thrive as a top-six basketball conference with the addition of Gonzaga as a basketball-only member, as well as prominent former Mountain West schools. For the 2026-27 basketball season, the Pac-12 will operate as a nine-member league featuring Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, Gonzaga, Oregon State, San Diego State, Texas State, Utah State and Washington State.It also projects as a potential Group of Six leader in football and could see its champion clinch a spot in the College Football Playoff on a regular basis.\n            ",

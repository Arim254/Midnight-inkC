    "body": "\n        The Baltimore Orioles have agreed to terms with the top power hitter remaining on the free agent market. The O's and first baseman Pete Alonso have agreed to a five-year contract worth $155 million, CBS Sports has confirmed. The deal does not include any opt outs, per the New York Post. The team has not yet announced the signing.  The signing comes one day after it was reported the Orioles offered Kyle Schwarber the same five-year, $150 million contract he took to return to the Philadelphia Phillies. Essentially, the O's added $1 million per year to that contract, pivoted to Alonso, and got it done. The $31 million is the second-highest average annual value ever given to a first baseman. Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Blue Jays: $35.7 millionPete Alonso, Orioles: $31 millionMiguel Cabrera, Tigers: $31 millionFreddie Freeman, Dodgers: $27 millionPaul Goldschmidt, Cardinals: $27 millionErstwhile top prospect Coby Mayo did not impress in his big-league time in 2025 and could now find himself on the trade block. The Orioles have been connected to just about every starting pitcher this offseason, though rumblings of a trade with the Miami Marlins for righty Edward Cabrera have persisted at the Winter Meetings. Mayo could be a factor there. With the caveat that there is still a long way to go between now and Opening Day, Baltimore's lineup now looks something like this heading into 2026: \n2B Jackson Holliday, LHB3B Jordan Westburg, RHBSS Gunnar Henderson, LHB1B Pete Alonso, RHBRF Dylan Beavers, LHB/Tyler O'Neill, RHBLF Taylor Ward, RHBC Adley Rutschman, SHBCF Colton Cowser, LHBDH Samuel Basallo, LHB/Ryan Mountcastle, RHBThe Orioles need to add to their rotation behind Trevor Rogers and Kyle Bradish, and more bullpen help can't hurt, but that is a strong lineup with Alonso and Ward bringing much needed right-handed power. The O's ranked 11th in home runs in 2025 and their lineup was very left-handed heavy at times. They're much more powerful and balanced now. Alonso, 31, hit .272/.347/.524 (144 OPS+) this past season with 38 home runs and 126 runs batted in. His contributions were worth an estimated 3.4 Wins Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference's calculations. For his career, he's posted a 135 OPS+ and averaged 3.7 WAR and 42 home runs per season. Alonso is a five-time All-Star team honoree. CBS Sports wrote the following while ranking Alonso as the ninth-best free agent in this winter's class: \nAlonso just had one of the best seasons of his career. Can he convert that into the multi-year contract that evaded him last winter? It's hard to say. He sliced into his strikeout rate and established a new personal-best hard-hit percentage -- that's saying something, given strength is his defining characteristic. But modern front offices view non-elite righty first basemen with a certain indifference. Alonso now further into his 30s, too, making it easier for teams to fret about when, not if, he'll begin to decline. \tAlonso had spent his entire career with the New York Mets up to this point, and this past summer he became the franchise's all-time home run leader. Last winter, his first foray into free agency resulted in a two-year pact worth $54 million. That contract enabled Alonso to opt out and return to the free-agent market this offseason -- this time without the qualifying offer attached. In June 2023, the Mets reportedly offered Alonso a seven-year extension that would have paid him $158 million from 2024-30. Between his arbitration salary in 2024, his free-agent deal in 2025, and this new contract, Alonso will now be paid $205.5 million from 2024-30. He bet on himself in June 2023 and came out far ahead in the long run. \nThe Mets traded Brandon Nimmo last month and lost Edwin Díaz to the Dodgers in free agency Tuesday. Now Alonso is leaving as well. This offseason represents a sea change for the Mets, who went a disappointing 83-79 in 2025 and missed the postseason after giving Juan Soto the largest contract in sports history. If nothing else, they are being decisive and making big changes. New York does not necessarily have to bring in a new first baseman to replace Alonso. They can shift Mark Vientos to first base and roll with Brett Baty and/or Ronny Mauricio at third base. They could also sign Alex Bregman to man the hot corner. They've been connected to the three-time All-Star throughout the offseason and could now ramp up their efforts to sign him. \nAlonso will make his return to Citi Field as a visiting player next season, from Sept. 14-16. \n            ",

The final stage of PGA Tour Q-School takes center stage this week in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, continuing two weeks of survive-and-advance style of golf to earn playing privileges on the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry Tour next season.The penultimate stage was held last week across five sites scattered throughout the United States, where five different 72-hole stroke-play competitions were expected to take place. Due to weather, two sites were shortened to 54 holes. A total of 88 players advanced to the final stage from these five locations with this run of golf representing both a sprint in terms of quality of game and a marathon in terms of mental toughness.\"[There's a little bit of a mental shift] I would say, but not in a bad way for me, though,\" explained Kieron Van Wyk, who earned his spot in the second stage due to his final standing in PGA Tour University rankings but ultimately failed to qualify for the final stage. \"I feel like I don't really have anything to lose but everything to gain. Having a good week and finishing top five in the final stage means I'll be playing on the PGA Tour next year. Pretty much just going out there, all systems go with nothing to lose and everything to gain.\"PGA Tour status -- given to the top five finishers (no ties) in the final stage -- is not the only carrot dangling in front of these players. Those who medaled at the five qualifying sites in the second stage -- assuming they do not improve their status in the final stage -- earned Korn Ferry Tour membership and will be subject to the second reorder of the 2026 season.\nAfter those who finish top five (i.e. those who earn their PGA Tour status for the 2026 season) in the final stage, the next 40 finishers and ties will earn status on the Korn Ferry Tour and exemptions from the periodic reorders at the onset of the year -- the top 25 of this bunch being subject to the third reorder and those after being subject to the second. The remainder of the 176-player field will earn conditional membership on the Korn Ferry Tour and membership on the PGA Tour Americas and be subject to the reorder.So, keep this in mind as the spotlight inevitably (and rightfully) shines on those battling for PGA Tour membership. Unlike last year, where the top five and ties earned full-time cards, only the top five will this year, continuing a tightening-of-the-belt trend on the PGA Tour. (A hole-by-hole playoff will be contested if needed.)\n\"It's where I want to be, so I am definitely paying attention to [changes to the PGA Tour membership structure],\" Van Wyk continued. \"They are just making it harder and harder, but subsequently, I think that is a good thing. I am very aware of what is going on with 10 cards getting taken away from the Korn Ferry Tour as well.

    "body": "\n        NEW YORK — In the past 35 years, only two reigning national champions started a season losing four of their first nine games. This year's Florida Gators are one of the two.The other was 2014-15 UConn, which finished 20-15 and missed the NCAA Tournament under then-coach Kevin Ollie.That won't be the fate for No. 18 Florida, though. A team that began the season ranked No. 3, including eight first-place ballots from AP voters, is disappointing in record but still promising in predictive metrics. At this point, the Gators are still searching for themselves and hunting for answers, knowing good results are well within reach. For a spurt on Tuesday night, it looked like Todd Golden's team might have finally earned some clarity, only to see its latest high-profile game close in thrilling but disappointing style at the Jimmy V Classic, a 77-73 loss vs. No. 5 UConn. Florida may well have gotten the game to overtime if Boogie Fland had been able to inbound the ball with 9.3 seconds to go, Florida down three. Instead, Fland turned the ball over on a five-second call — a quick whistle, too. Golden said as much at his postgame presser.\n\"I thought they called it early, man, to be honest,\" he said. \"I challenge everybody to time it and see what they come up with. We timed it in the locker room, and we got 4.6 and 4.7. In a moment like that — I've been around the game for a long time, to get a call like that where it doesn't even get to five seconds — usually they give you an extra second, to be honest. Just a really, really tough pill to swallow.\" Golden wasn't using the call as an excuse for the loss, though. In fact, Golden told CBS Sports that the sequence highlights the biggest difference between this season's team and the one that took the NCAA championship in April. \"It's very simple: our margin for error isn't what it was last year,\" Golden said. \n\n        \n            \n                AJ Dybantsa arrives as an elite player by leading late BYU rally in win vs. Clemson at Madison Square Garden\n                \n                    Matt Norlander                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nA season ago, Florida went 12-2 against ranked competition. This season it's 0-3, albeit with losses to Arizona (in Las Vegas to start the season), Duke (on the road) and UConn (at MSG/Storrs South). That's three of the six best teams in the sport. Those losses have come by a combined 11 points with every game coming down to the final two possessions.That's why every mainstream predictive metric has UF ranked 16th or better as of Wednesday morning. You can lose games and still be projected as a pretty good team, provided the teams you're losing to are really good. And that's where Golden's team finds itself one-quarter of the way through the season. The biggest problem Golden is dealing with is one any coach would accept: win a national championship thanks to having the best three-guard starting lineup in school history, only to struggle to replace that group mere months later. \nWalter Clayton Jr., Will Richard and Alijah Martin are forever legends in Gainesville. In their stead, Arkansas transfer Boogie Fland and former Princeton point guard Xaivian Lee are undeniably feeling the strain of living up to lofty standard. \n\"I think we're all feeling a little bit of the pressure of playing this really difficult schedule, coming in with some real expectations, whereas last year, I don't think anybody really believed in our team until after the New Year,\" Golden told me. \"We lost a very good backcourt. It's going to take a little time for this team to continue to get comfortable. Unlike last year, we didn't have a schedule that allowed us to beat up on teams and gain confidence that way. So we have to kind of build that up a little differently.\" Florida's non-con schedule ranks No. 3 in the country, by the way. The fourth loss was against TCU in San Diego, a blown lead that ended 84-80. That's the only one that bothers Golden.\n\"It's all about being mentally tough man and being able to be mature and professional in terms of the way we're evaluating ourselves,\" Golden said. \"It's pretty clear that we have not played our best yet. We haven't had a night where everybody was really rolling. And with that being said, we're right in every single one of these games.\" At 9-1, UConn might prove to be as great as any team in the country this season. The Huskies have yet to play a game where everyone on the roster was truly at full strength. On Tuesday night, Florida was down 10 in the second half and pushed back to take the lead. At one point it peeled off a 17-7 run. The two most recent national champions gave us a game worthy of the hype.\"This isn't a lack of a talent issue or something that leaves me hopeless,\" Golden said. \"A big part of it is taking advantage of the second chance opportunities. We can't have 16 offensive rebounds and only turn that into six or seven points.\"\nLee (and Fland, to a lesser extent) have been the primary targets for criticism over the past five weeks, but if not for Lee on Tuesday night, Florida loses by double digits. He had a team-best 19 points in addition to six rebounds, five assists and two steals. The problematic pattern didn't cease, though: Lee's 3-point shooting was a problem here as it's been in every game. He's just 20.3% from deep this season and was 1-of-7 beyond the arc against UConn. Had Lee hit one or two more treys, maybe the game turns for Florida. Golden told me the lack of reliable perimeter shooting is limiting Florida's ability to jump into that top tier of teams this season. That's backed up by the fact that Thomas Haugh (18 points) was terrific again. Fellow forward Alex Condon (14 points) had a good night, as did Rueben Chinyelu, who snagged 11 boards. The bigs are jelling and building up into one of the best frontcourts the sport has to offer.\"We're close, but we're not there yet against the top four or five teams in America,\" Golden said. \"It's not like we're getting run out of the gym in these games. We're right there.\"\nAn interesting game is up next in Sunrise, Florida, this Saturday against 8-2 George Washington, but Florida should see an influx of wins coming over the next three weeks. With the SEC markedly down from last season's record-setting campaign, the toughest portion of this team's schedule looks to be over. The Gators were overrated in October, but this should still be one of the SEC's best teams by the end of January.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After spending five years away from the NFL, Philip Rivers is out of retirement. The 44-year-old quarterback signed Tuesday with the Indianapolis Colts to join their practice squad. There is a chance he could play in his first game since 2020 when the team travels to face the Seattle Seahawks. Contributing to the Colts' playoff push is a challenge that Rivers said he is excited to tackle.The extended time in retirement, Rivers' age and the quick ramp-up period raise questions about whether the former Colts and Chargers standout would be proficient in leading an offense in 2025. Indianapolis is desperate to find out after Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury, and Rivers has something to prove to himself.\"I wasn't really hanging on to any hope of playing again,\" Rivers said after his arrival at the team facility. \"I kind of thought that ship had sailed. But something about it excited me. It's kind of one of those deals -- a door opens and you can either walk through it and find out if you can do it, or run from it.\"I know that there's risk involved, obviously, on what may or may not happen. But the only way to find out is going for it. I just felt almost like it was a gift, another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys and the game you love to play and the dream that you got to live. You may get some bonus time.\"\nIf Rivers gets the start on Sunday, he will become just the fifth starting quarterback in NFL history at age 44 or older. Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg are the only such players to come before.The threat of injury looms large for a player of his age, but it will not deter Rivers from attempting a comeback.\"As you see every week, whether you're 24 in the best shape of your life or whether you're 44 and not sure sure, anything can happen,\" Rivers said. \"So that has never been a concern of mine. You never hope or expect something like that to happen, but if something like that happens, I've got a long time to recover.\"\nRivers said he received a call from coach Shane Steichen on Sunday after Jones suffered his injury. He took air reps on Monday and felt confident enough to take the next steps and ultimately sign to the practice squad. The decision process came with some doubt, but the prospect of proving that he can still play and doing so with a franchise that he loves was too big a draw to turn down.Rivers will reunite with Steichen, who served as quarterbacks coach and interim offensive coordinator for the Chargers during their time together. He will also share a locker room with 14 of his old teammates from the 2020 season.\"There's something about being back in this building that feels right,\" Rivers said.\n            ",

Daley appeared to hurt his leg during the postgame celebration while jumping to high-five Hoosiers fans in the stands. He was later seen in an air cast as trainers took him into the locker room on a cart.Daley underwent tests over the weekend that revealed the extent of the injury, which Cignetti called \"serious\" and said is anticipated to keep him out for the remainder of the season.Daley would have been one of the top defensive players in the CFP if not for the injury. The senior led the Big Ten this season with 19 tackles for loss and racked up 5.5 sacks in his first year on a Power Four roster. He joined Indiana through the transfer portal last offseason after spending the first three years of his career at Kent State.\"This postgame was a little different than most,\" Cignetti said to reporters on Wednesday. \"So I didn't get into the coaches room probably until 45 minutes after the game, and that was the first I had heard about [Daley's injury] and then we were walking to my press conference.\n\"Sunday was still sort of waiting a little bit on images to come back, that sort of thing. So when I had my press conference (on Sunday), there was a little more information that still had to come in. I was still processing the whole thing because it was sort of unbelievable when I heard about it, and I think that is why I said we had nobody hurt in the game, during the game.\"While Daley was not a full-time starter during the regular season, he made an immense impact for one of college football's most formidable defenses. He recorded at least one tackle for loss in all but two games and hit his stride down the stretch with 2.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage against Penn State, 3.0 against Wisconsin, 4.5 against Purdue and 1.0 in the Big Ten Championship Game.\nThe absence of a premier force on the defensive front could prove problematic for the Hoosiers given that their road to a national championship runs through a few of the sport's top offenses. Indiana will play the winner of Alabama and Oklahoma in the quarterfinals when it opens CFP play as the No. 1 overall seed.\n            \n    ",

According to the latest 2025 Heisman Trophy odds, Mendoza is the heavy -1000 favorite (risk $1,000 to win $100), followed by Pavia (+600), Love (+25000) and Sayin (+40000).It certainly seems like a quarterback will be taking the Heisman Trophy home this year after Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter broke the streak of three straight quarterback winners last season. Mendoza and Pavia are the two favorites to win the award now that most votes have been cast following championship game weekend. Though a quarterback winning the Heisman is nothing new, it would still be a historic triumph for either Mendoza or Pavia -- neither Indiana nor Vanderbilt have ever produced a Heisman winner. Bet college football bowl games at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $200 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Neither Sayin nor Love should be entirely discounted. Sayin started at quarterback for the best team in college football -- entering the Big Ten Championship Game, at least -- and Love is one of the most talented running backs to pass through Notre Dame in the modern era.\nHere's a more detailed look at the four players who made the cut for the 2025 Heisman Trophy. Fernando Mendoza, QB, Indiana Mendoza is now the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy after his heroic performance in Indiana's Big Ten Championship Game win against Ohio State. Mendoza helped the Hoosiers capture their first outright conference title in 80 years with 15 completions for 222 yards and one touchdown. He effectively sealed the 13-10 victory with a perfectly placed 33-yard pass to wide receiver Charlie Becker that converted a third-and-6 with just over two minutes to play. Mendoza also orchestrated the crucial 88-yard touchdown drive in which he completed passes of 51 yards and 17 yards for the decisive score. That brought his stats on the year to a respectable 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns through the air. He also rushed for six touchdowns. Mendoza won't win because of the box score, though, but more for his impact in leading a historically deficient program to new heights. Diego Pavia, QB, VanderbiltSpeaking of leading programs that have struggled historically, Pavia is the engine behind Vanderbilt's modern Renaissance under coach Clark Lea. He's emerged as one of the nation's premier playmakers -- akin to Johnny Manziel and the freestyling gunslingers of yore -- and his hot close to the season has him on the precipice of winning college football's most prestigious individual award. He averaged a whopping 455.8 total yards of offense and was responsible for 16 touchdowns in Vanderbilt's last four games. He rushed for 165 yards on 8.3 yards per carry in Vanderbilt's regular season finale against Tennessee, which helped propel the Commodores to their first win against their in-state rival since 2018.\nYou can bet college football at FanDuel Sportsbook, where new users get $150 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:Julian Sayin, QB, Ohio State Sayin's Heisman outlook seems to have faded in the wake of Ohio State's Big Ten Championship Game loss, though he turned in a solid 258-yard, one-touchdown performance. That also marked the 11th game this season in which he completed at least 70% of his passes. It should come as no surprise that his 78.4% completion rate leads all FBS quarterbacks. As does his 182.1 passer rating among quarterbacks that have thrown the ball at least 100 times this season. Sayin has at least one more year before he's eligible for the NFL Draft, so there's a good chance this won't be the last time he's involved in the Heisman conversation. Jeremiyah Love, RB, Notre Dame Love most likely won't win the Heisman, but he certainly belongs at the ceremony. He's powered Notre Dame's offense all season long as one of the most explosive runners in college football. Love is one of just two running backs at the FBS level with at least 1,000 yards rushing on 6.9 yards per carry. His eight-carry, 171-yard performance in Notre Dame's 70-7 win against Syracuse was one of the best rushing performances all season. It's also rather typical of what Love accomplished with the Fighting Irish.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Whether it's the Broncos, Patriots, Rams, Seahawks or any other NFL contender, one thing is for sure -- the roster of singers on Super Bowl Sunday are all stars in their own right. In addition to the announcement of Bad Bunny being named the featured halftime performer earlier this season, we know that Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones have been added to the list of singers for the big game next February.The Bad Bunny announcement followed months of rumors and predictions, and was made in a subtle way back at the end of September. Headlining the Super Bowl halftime show is one of the top singing gigs of the year, and this was how the 31-year-old singer made the announcement on social media. \nThe Puerto Rican singer is the most-streamed artist in the world. Bad Bunny has 10 Grammy nominations, with three wins. His three Grammy wins are for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album for YHLQMDLG, Best Musica Urbana Album for El Último Tour Del Mundo and Un Verano Sin Ti.Some of his other awards include the American Music Award for Favorite Latin Artist, the BET Award for Single of the Year for his hit song \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and J Balvin and Billboard Top Latin.\nBad Bunny's top songs are \"Vete,\" \"Titi Me Pregunto,\" \"Que Pasaria\" and \"BAILE INoLIDABLE.\" Usually the special guests are announced closer to the championship game. One early guess for a special guest is Cardi B, who is also connected to the NFL because she recently gave birth to boy, the son of Patriots receiver Stefon Diggs. Rapper Kendrick Lamar, who brought out multiple special guests including SZA and Serena Williams, was last year's headliner. Some other iconic halftime performers include Prince, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Paul McCartney, U2 and Bruce Springsteen, just to name a few. The halftime show become a cultural moment for the masses as it is typically the most-watched performance of the year. \nBut the day's festivities begin long before halftime. Multiple artists will perform ahead of the game, including Grammy-nominated singer Charlie Puth, 11x Grammy-winning artist Brandi Carlile and Grammy-winning R&B artist Coco Jones.\"Charlie, Brandi, and Coco are generational talents, and we are honored to have them -- alongside our extraordinary deaf performers -- on Super Bowl LX's world stage,\" said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. \"This moment embodies the very best of culture, live performance, and our country, perfectly kicking off game day.\" Here's a look at who will perform each pregame song:\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"Charlie Puth and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam will perform the national anthem ahead of the big game. Puth is a multi-award winning and multi-platinum singer, songwriter and producer. His hits include \"See You Again,\" \"Attention\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore.\"\n\"America the Beautiful\"Brandi Carlile and Deaf music performer Julian Ortiz will perform \"America the Beautiful.\" Carlile has an impressive resume that includes an Oscar nomination, two Emmy wins and a book that reached No. 1 on The New York Times' bestsellers list. \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\"\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" will be performed by Coco Jones and renowned Deaf music artist Fred Beam. Jones has quickly made a name for herself in R&B music, with eight Grammy nominations. Her hit \"ICU\" is platinum certified. She is an actress as well as a musician.The 60th edition of the Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, on NBC. The backdrop of the game and performances will be Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        As we head into the home stretch of the season, things are looking as tight as ever before in the NFL playoff races. We're currently in the midst of arguably the most closely contested division races in recent NFL history, for example, with five of the eight divisions having first and second place separated by one game or fewer and all eight being separated by two games or fewer, with just four games to go in the regular season.One of the closest division races is that of the AFC South, where we have one team at 9-4 (the Jaguars) and two teams right behind them at 8-5 (the Texans and Colts). Because things are so tight, we wanted to take this opportunity to give you the lay of the land. We'll show you the standings, the tiebreakers, the odds, the remaining schedules and also the wild card picture as these teams look to lay their claim to a postseason spot while they navigate these next four weeks.Current AFC South standings, tiebreakers, odds projectionsW-LTiebreaker 1:   Head-to-headTiebreaker 2:   Division W-L      1. Jaguars9-41-1 vs HOU; 1-0 vs IND3-12. Texans8-51-1 vs JAX; 1-0 vs IND4-13. Colts8-50-1 vs JAX; 0-1 vs HOU2-2The Jaguars own the first seed at the moment because they're a game ahead of both the Texans and the Colts. Should they end up tied with the same record, though, the other tiebreakers come into play.As we turn our attention to Week 15, the stage only gets brighter and the road to January, for many teams, officially begins now and CBS will be airing over a handful of games with playoff implications. \nRight now, the first tiebreaker between Jacksonville and Houston would be tied. They're 1-1 against each other and each 1-0 against the Colts. The Colts, meanwhile, are 0-2 combined against the other two teams. If only one of the Jags and Texans wins their remaining game against Indianapolis, that team would have the tiebreaker edge. If both win or both lose, we would move to the second tiebreaker, which is division record. The Colts need to win both of those games in order to force their way into the division record tiebreaker.The Texans have the division tiebreaker at the moment because they have played an extra game against the Titans compared with the Jaguars. Jacksonville gets Tennessee in the final week of the season. If both teams finish 5-1 or 4-2 in the division, we'd move to the third tiebreaker, which is record against common opponents. Over at DraftKings, the Jaguars are -165 to win the division, while the Texans are +150 and the Colts are +2200. And as of this writing, our friends at Sportsline give the Jaguars a 47% chance to win the division, while the Texans have a 34% chance and the Colts are down at 17%. \nAll Jacksonville needs to do to win the division title is win the same number of games as Houston does the rest of the way. If the Jags do that, they'll remain ahead by one game in the division race and avoid any tiebreaker scenarios.Houston needs to win at least one more game than Jacksonville. If the Texans win two more games than the Jags, they can take the division outright. If they win one more, that will trigger the tiebreaker scenarios and we could get into things like record against common opponents.Indianapolis also needs to win at least one more game than Jacksonville, but also needs to beat both the Jaguars and Texans along the way because otherwise it will lose the head-to-head tiebreaker and fall into contention for a wild card spot. The Colts would then need to win the common opponents tiebreaker to claim the division crown.\n\n        \n            \n                AFC North playoff race, scenarios, odds: Why Steelers have major edge on Ravens with four weeks to go\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nRemaining schedule for Jaguars, Texans, ColtsGameJaguarsTexansColtsWeek 15Jets (3-10)Cardinals (3-10)at Seahawks (10-3)Week 16at Broncos (11-2)Raiders (2-11)49ers (9-4)Week 17at Colts (8-5)at Chargers (9-4)Jaguars (9-4)Week 18Titans (2-11)Colts (8-5)at Texans (8-5)Unfortunately for the Colts, who just lost their starting quarterback, they have the toughest remaining strength of schedule in the league. Their remaining opponents have a combined winning percentage of .692, which is the equivalent of an 11.8-win team. They have to be considered extreme long shots here. Jacksonville has a slightly tougher remaining strength of schedule (.462, 23rd in the NFL) than does Houston (.423, 27th). This is because while both teams face the 8-5 Colts, plus one team that is 2-11 and another that is 3-10, the Jaguars' fourth game is against the 11-2 Broncos while the Texans' fourth game is against the 9-4 Chargers. The Jags can afford to drop a game and still move into a tie with the Texans, but they'd be triggering the tiebreaker scenarios described above. And things could get complicated if they wind up with the same record and same division record as Houston.Can any team claim a wild card bid?AFC wild card standingsW-L5. Chargers9-46. Bills9-47. Texans8-58. Colts8-59. Ravens6-710. Chiefs6-711. Dolphins6-7It sure looks like there's going to be room for one of these teams -- and potentially two if the Colts can win some games with their backup quarterback, whether that's Riley Leonard, Brett Rypien or Philip Rivers -- to make a run at a wild card spot. The Texans and Colts currently have two-game leads on the trio of teams that are chasing them for the No. 7 seed, all of whom have 6-7 records. The Jaguars, if they were to drop back, have a three-game lead on those squads. SportsLine gives the Texans a 78% chance to make the playoffs despite their division odds sitting at only 34%, which means they're favored to come away with one of those wild card slots. The Jaguars are favored to win the division at 47% but also have an 84% chance to make the playoffs outright, according to Sportsline. The Colts are down at a 46% chance to make the playoffs, per SportsLine.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAS VEGAS — The ACC has found itself in the College Football Playoff crossfire in two of the past three seasons, and now the league is pushing for swift changes to the format.ACC commissioner Jim Phillips on Wednesday called for an immediate expansion of the 12-team playoff and said he wants the CFP to examine whether it should scale back the weekly rankings released during the five weeks leading up to Selection Sunday.The window to expand before the 2026-27 season is closing fast. ESPN granted CFP leaders an extension until Jan. 23 to finalize a decision. The prevailing expectation had been that the playoff would stay at 12 teams because the 10 FBS conferences and Notre Dame have been unable to reach consensus on a 16-team (or larger) model.\"I would prefer not to wait another year, but I only speak for the ACC,\" Phillips said Wednesday after a speaking engagement at the Intercollegiate Athletics Forum.\nNotre Dame's fury over its exclusion from this year's CFP helped change the tone. Athletic director Pete Bevacqua accused the ACC of pushing for Miami to be selected over the Irish. Notre Dame has a football scheduling partnership with the ACC and is a full member of the conference in 24 other sports. Bevacqua said Monday the school's relationship with the ACC suffered \"permanent damage\" because of what he believed were ACC attacks on Notre Dame's résumé.Conference commissioners met Tuesday in Las Vegas to discuss the playoff, but no format agreement emerged. Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark told CBS Sports he also prefers expansion now rather than waiting until 2027-28. The SEC remains focused on a 16-team format, an SEC spokesperson told CBS Sports.\"We have good teams being left out,\" said Phillips, \"I think we have that responsibility to make sure that we get to a number that we feel better about, that either we believe anybody after that wouldn't necessarily win [a national championship], or we at least cut into that margin. And I don't know what we can get done in the next six weeks, but we're committed to staying together and working together and working with the management committee to figure this thing out.\"\nPhillips reiterated his opposition to any format that awards disproportionate automatic qualifiers to the power leagues. The Big Ten recently proposed a 16-team model that would give both the Big Ten and SEC four AQs each, while the ACC and Big 12 would receive two apiece.The Big Ten and SEC control the votes needed to set the future format, but the sides have yet to reach an agreement on any structure beyond 12 teams. The Big Ten floated a 24-team model earlier this fall, but it failed to gain SEC support -- though several SEC athletic directors remain intrigued by the concept, industry sources told CBS Sports.Phillips: CFP's weekly rankings 'disruptive'Phillips is also pushing to reevaluate the CFP's weekly rankings shows on ESPN. The committee's top 25 is currently unveiled in each of the five weeks before Selection Sunday. The group drew criticism this year for keeping Miami below Notre Dame until flipping them in the final week, citing the Week 1 head-to-head result.\n\"The weekly shows draw a lot of interest. They're incredibly disruptive and very hard for the schools and the conferences,\" Phillips said. \"And I understand why we do the shows, and it's part of the agreement with ESPN. but it causes great anxiety throughout. We have to find a better way moving forward as it relates to some of that, some of that pre-information.\"Phillips said it is unclear whether any adjustments can be made under ESPN's contract, and commissioners did not address the issue during Tuesday's meeting.College football's weekly reveal schedule is unique. By contrast, the NCAA basketball tournaments release a top-16 preview one month before Selection Sunday, before the field is selected in March.\n\"You've gotta believe that those 16 teams are gonna be in the field at 68, right?\" Phillips said. \"So there's less pressure there, and it's a fun thing and kind of a way to create interest with a month to go before Selection Sunday.\"ACC will explore changes to tiebreaker protocolPart of the disruption in the ACC's playoff push this season was the logjam at the top of its regular-season standings. Miami, the highest-ranked ACC team in the CFP, did not reach the ACC Championship because of the league's five-way tiebreaker policy. Virginia and Duke met in the title game, with the five-loss Blue Devils emerging as the ACC champion, placing more uncertainty on whether the power conference would be left out of the CFP completely this month.Phillips wants to explore tweaking the tiebreaker policy and implementing CFP rankings into the protocol.\n\"Who knew that we would get to the seventh tiebreaker with five teams that were 6-2?\" he said. \"It's just the stars aligned in a way that nobody predicted, but no one should throw shade on Duke. They earned the right. Everybody had a chance to be part of that tiebreaker, and they played great. They won the league. They held the trophy. So I was super happy for Duke. It worked out the way it was supposed to work out relative to that's the tiebreaker we put in place, but we'll come back together. It would be smart of us to now also have a CFP maybe component in there, in the tiebreaker.\"The ACC eliminated divisions in 2023, before the additions of Cal and Stanford in an expansion to 17 teams, further complicating a large league without divisions.Phillips suggested all conferences follow similar tiebreaker protocols, citing the power conferences all set to play nine conference games starting next season. The ACC and SEC recently voted to move from eight to nine conference games.\n\"Maybe there's something that allows less confusion about what everybody's tiebreaker is in college football,\" Phillips said.\n            ",

Then he mashed the new owner YOLO button with glee once more and shipped four first-round swaps and six second-round picks to the Wizards for Bradley Beal. It was a disaster. The Suns won 36 games last year and missed the playoffs. Then they traded Durant to Houston and waived and stretched Beal. But hey, you can't keep Ishbia down. Less-resilient owners would have slinked into the background and licked their wounds. Avoided the spotlight. Kept quiet. Not Ishbia. He stayed in the foreground and said what he had to say with his whole chest. This offseason he went on social media to basically go \"nuh-uh\" when a fellow basketball scribbler predicted the Suns would finish this season with the worst defense in the NBA. He proclaimed on an Arizona radio show that the Suns would be \"competitive\" and promised to field \"a team you're gonna be proud of.\" And, perhaps most notably, he took umbrage with preseason predictions that were unkind to the Suns, insisting he was \"not too worried about what the so-called experts think.\"\nOur so-called experts right here at CBSSports.com did not think much of the Suns coming into this season. All eight of us had them outside the play-in in our preseason predictions. I had them 14th in the West. I thought that was generous. Considering we're roughly a quarter of the way into the season, it's probably too soon to have the last laugh, but Ishbia will be forgiven if he's chuckling to himself nevertheless. Because as pleasant Western Conference surprises go, Phoenix has to be right at the top of the list. And pretty much no one saw it coming. Or if they did, they were a lot quieter about it than Ishbia. The Suns are 14-10 and one game behind the Timberwolves for the six seed in the West (a team they just beat in Minnesota even though they were short-handed and Anthony Edwards went for 40 points). They're nearly top 10 in offensive and defensive ratings. Rookie head coach Jordan Ott has them bombing away from deep, where they're eighth in 3-point attempts and sixth in makes per game. They're also sixth in offensive rebounds. But the secret sauce might be how pesky they've been defensively, where they're second in both opponent's turnover percentage and points off turnovers. Only OKC has been better in those opportunistic categories. When you're keeping up with the Thunder in those specific departments you're doing something right. \nPhoenix has been without the services of Devin Booker for the last week while he recovers from a groin strain. (He's listed as questionable for Wednesday evening's NBA Cup quarterfinal clash against OKC.) The Suns have also been without Jalen Green for much of the season. Green was absent for the first eight outings, then promptly hurt his hamstring in his second game back. He's played a grand total of 30 minutes this season. As a consequence of missing key personnel, Ott has gone deep into his rotation and has nine players averaging at least 20 minutes per game. (Incidentally, Ott should get at least a perfunctory whisper in the Coach of the Year conversation.) Mark Williams -- acquired from the Hornets during the summer for two first-round picks -- has settled in as the starting center and shown flashes of what made him theoretically attractive to the Lakers before that trade was awkwardly unraveled last season. Royce O'Neale and Grayson Allen have been fixtures in the starting lineup. And the Suns might have stumbled onto something in Collin Gillespie, who has made himself indispensable and is averaging career highs in minutes, points, rebounds, assists and steals while shooting 42.9 percent from deep.\nBut perhaps the biggest boost to the Suns unexpected good fortune has been Dillon Brooks averaging a career-best 22.1 points on 45.3% shooting. Of course, he's also taking 7.4 3s per game and hitting just 30.6%, but it's all part of the Dillon Brooks Experience. Everyone expects him to annoy and frustrate the opposition, but I'm not sure anyone anticipated he'd be this involved in the Suns offense. There has been so much Dillon Brooks that even Dillon Brooks might say well hold on a minute that might be too much Dillon Brooks. Just kidding. No one loves a supersized serving of Dillon Brooks more than Dillon Brooks. \nBrooks' usage rate is a whopping, career-high 29.7. Without Booker on the floor that number spikes to a comical 38.1. If you're thinking that kind of heavy engagement has probably resulted in some ugly offense and inadvisable shots, you are correct. In previous seasons, with other organizations under normal circumstances, I'd watch whatever that was and think it serves Brooks' team right for empowering him to that degree. Except this is not previous seasons, and the circumstances he's operating under in Phoenix have so far worked out for him and the Suns. And so we've all been treated to a fair amount of no-no-no-yes offense from Brooks that shouldn't work but somehow has on more nights than not. Eventually folding Booker and Green back into the mix should shrink some of Brooks' overinflated usage. And having all three of those guys on the floor at the same time might not be workable. But at the very least finding out figures to be fun. \nThat last word is not one I thought would get deployed much in relation to this Suns team. Slog. Grueling. Unbearable. Things of that nature, maybe. Instead, the Suns traded one of the best players in NBA history and are somehow playing better and putting a compelling product on the floor. None of which absolves the Suns front office of previously and repeatedly detonating their future. But this season, right now, they have gone from being close to unwatchable to competitive and entertaining on most evenings. Aside from Mat Ishbia, who would have predicted that?\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Multiple things can be true about the 2025 Ravens:This team can still win the AFC North. Given the general volatility of the Steelers, the Bengals putting themselves in too deep of a hole and the Browns being, well, the Browns, Baltimore can still win the division and make the playoffs. If it beats Cincinnati on Sunday and then takes down the Steelers in Week 18, The Athletic gives Baltimore a 79% chance of making the postseason. All of this seems doable! However, that leads me to my second point:This is a very flawed football team. The 2025 version of the Ravens feels toothless in a lot of areas. With the mentioned division games left and tilts against the Patriots and Packers still on the schedule, Baltimore and head coach John Harbaugh are running out of time to find the answers to their problems, and it could lead to some serious soul searching in the offseason.Offense stuck without Lamar at full strengthPerhaps the most baffling thing about the Ravens this season has been how inept the offense has looked at times. Since Lamar Jackson's return from injury, their points per drive have dropped to 1.96, just above the Chargers, who are starting you and me on the offensive line. Their drive score percentage (percentage of drives that end with a touchdown or field goal) is tied with the Texans, who are still struggling to find themselves offensively. Their EPA per play is tied with the Cardinals, who have Jacoby Brissett at quarterback. The vibes are in shambles for this Ravens offense, and there's not a lot of time to turn it around for a playoff push.\nWhere I think the first issue within the Ravens offense lies is simple: despite being back, Jackson isn't healthy. It's evidenced by not only the amount he's scrambling, but also how effective he is. \nAccording to NFL Pro, Jackson has scrambled on 16.9% of his dropbacks this season, the lowest output of his career. In addition, since returning from injury he's only had 4.6 carries per game between designed runs and scrambles, well below his career average of 8.9. Across the entire season, his designed run rate has been the lowest since Todd Monken took over as offensive coordinator, a sign that he just might not be fully back yet.The Ravens' entire offensive ecosystem is reliant on Jackson's legs -- not only to move the football himself, but the gravity he has as a runner opens lanes for Derrick Henry and opens up the rolodex of plays for Monken. You can call longer developing, explosive passes with Jackson using his legs, because he can buy himself time with his mobility. Without Jackson's legs, the margin for error in this offense gets razor thin, and it shows you just how much Jackson props up this entire unit. The offensive line only replaced one starter from last year (left guard Andrew Vorhees replaced Kevin Zeitler), but regression across the board has limited their capabilities in the run and passing game. Baltimore's 1.85 yards before contact per rush is the lowest mark of the Monken era, and you can really feel it when they get into the red zone. \nBecause the Ravens lack physicality up front, they can't displace people like they did in 2024, making red zone trips a LOT harder. This season, only 44.9% of the Ravens' red zone drives end in a touchdown, 30th in the NFL. Their rushing success rate in the red zone is 27th in the NFL, unbecoming of a team with Jackson and Henry. Most of the time, these runs look like this: Baltimore is trying to run outside zone to the right, with tight end Mark Andrews releasing to the second level. However, right guard Daniel Faalele can't sustain his block, and the play ends up only gaining one yard.\nThe passing game has also suffered from the ineffectiveness of the offensive line, taking explosives off the field because of quick pressures up the middle. This should be an explosive, the perfect play against Inverted Cover 2. Instead, Faalele oversets and gives up a quick pressure and Jackson is forced to check it down.\n\n        \n            \n                AFC North playoff race, scenarios, odds: Why Steelers have major edge on Ravens with four weeks to go\n                \n                    Zachary Pereles                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nDefense plagued by explosive plays and no pass rushFlipping it to the other side of the ball, the Ravens are simply bad on defense this year, giving up far too many explosives. On Sunday, Aaron Rodgers -- who is tied with Browns rookie Dillon Gabriel for the lowest air yards per attempt of qualifying NFL QBs -- had four completions of 20 or more air yards against the Ravens' defense. The last time he had a game with that many explosive passes was November of 2020 against the Lions. Baltimore has given up 53 plays of 20 yards or more this season, fifth-most in the NFL. Only the Bengals, Bears and Lions have given up more passes of 20 or more yards this season. According to TruMedia, defensive success rate quantifies how often you keep a team from gaining at least 50% of yards gained on first and second down and then preventing a first down on third and fourth. The Ravens are actually ninth in defensive success rate, meaning they don't allow teams to move the ball consistently on them. However, Sumer Sports has them ranked 22nd in EPA per play, simply because they allow so many big plays. Why they allow so many explosives is twofold.The first is that there's no pass rush. According to TruMedia, the Ravens' team pressure rate of 30.4% is the lowest it's been in three years, the effect of not having Pro Bowl defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike on the field. Kyle Van Noy is finally looking his age, rookie Mike Green still hasn't found his footing, and the defensive line depth took a hit after the Odafe Oweh trade.\nPlaying against Rodgers will always make a pass rush look lackluster given his razor quick time to throw, but Rodgers was also creating outside of the pocket and had a lot of time to shred the Ravens' pass coverage. The Ravens actually have this perfectly covered, but because Rodgers is afforded enough time because of the pass rush not getting home, he finds DK Metcalf for an explosive pass.\nBecause of their lack of pass rush, defensive coordinator Zach Orr has to blitz much more often than his predecessor, Mike Macdonald. The Ravens' 26.1% blitz rate is the highest it's been since 2022, often having to use Kyle Hamilton and Marlon Humphrey as blitzers to force the issue against quarterbacks.That opens up the next reason why they give up so many big plays: there are busted coverages every week. Under Orr, it feels like they haven't been as in sync as they need to be, and you see a lot of big plays given up as a result. Third-and-4 with the chance to get off the field down four points, and they just fail to cover running back Jaylen Warren out of the backfield and he runs into the end zone untouched.\nWhat doesn't get noticed on the TV copy, however, is that tight end Pat Freiermuth is ALSO open by a wide margin, and could've also been hit for a touchdown. A monumental coverage bust in the moment the Ravens needed to be the most on point.\nCoaching concerns are coming to the forefrontOn both sides of the ball, the Ravens lack the focus of a championship team. Coverage busts, drops at inopportune times and the lack of any bite up front could potentially sink this team's playoff hopes.The lack of focus falls on the coaching, which is where the Ravens may have to ask themselves some tough questions after the season. \nNow, I'm not calling for John Harbaugh's job yet, but if this team misses the playoffs given the way they've looked all season, I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that Harbaugh is no longer the leader of the Ravens.To put it simply, the time to figure things out for Baltimore is over. If it can't get wins right now, someone has to pay the bill.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        How long has the NBA been waiting for the Giannis Antetokounmpo sweepstakes? Certainly longer than last spring, when Damian Lillard's torn Achilles kicked speculation into overdrive. There was real fear for his future in 2023, when the Bucks lost in the first round as a No. 1 seed. They traded for Lillard and earned an extension. The same story played out in 2020, with their early playoff loss even coming against the same opponent, the Miami Heat. The Jrue Holiday trade delayed things. If Bucks fans are to believed, you could trace speculation all the way back to 2017. The moment a small market gets an All-Star, the big city bullies start scheming ways to steal him away.Signs are pointing to the Giannis trade sweepstakes finally coming -- this season and/or this summer -- and yet interest seems relatively tepid. The San Antonio Spurs could really pair Victor Wembanyama with Giannis Antetokounmpo for perhaps the greatest big man duo in NBA history. They won't give up Stephon Castle or Dylan Harper to do it, according to Jake Fischer. That same report indicated that the Hawks won't offer the 2026 first-round pick they acquired from New Orleans during Draft Day in June -- whichever pick between the Pelicans and Bucks winds up being higher. There was even a rumor from a Chicago anchor that the Antetokounmpo camp reached out to the Bulls only to find that they weren't interested, though that one has received a bit of pushback.Bet NBA games and futures at BetMGM Sportsbook, where new users get up to $1,500 in bonus bets back if their first wager doesn't win with the promo code CBSSPORTS:It's a somewhat startling turn of events. This isn't Ja Morant or LaMelo Ball, players who come with significant question marks without lengthy track records of success. This is Giannis Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP, the best player in the world on some nights and no worse than fourth or fifth on his worst, and most of the fanbases of teams that might like to acquire him are preaching caution. Yes, of course everybody wants him. They just want to get him at the right price, while holding onto their best asset or two. To an extent, that's how negotiations always work. But again, this is Giannis. Teams should be falling all over themselves to get someone this good. Someone ultimately will pay a hefty price to secure his services. But to this point, there's no indication that it's going to be, say, the price that the Clippers paid for Paul George, or that the Suns paid for Kevin Durant.\nThere are a lot of reasons why that seems to be the prevailing sentiment. You can probably guess at several. Antetokounmpo is 31 years old. His playing style, reliant on his remarkable athletic gifts, doesn't figure to age well, and his limitations as a shooter mean that he can fit onto a smaller pool of existing rosters than most players of his caliber. Injuries have nagged. He's missed an average of almost 15 games per year over the past four seasons, and his latest calf strain suggests he'll top that figure this season. Nobody knows which teams he would or would not be willing to sign an extension with, excluding, in all likelihood, his reported offseason preference of the New York Knicks. It's pretty standard stuff. But George had his share of injuries when he was dealt. So did Durant, and he was 34 when the Suns chased him. This stuff didn't used to matter at the level of star we're talking about here.Pick NBA props at Underdog Fantasy, where new users who play $5 now get $75 in site credits with promo code CBSSPORTS2 in select states:How one team is shifting the marketIt does now, and again, you can point to a number of possible reasons for that. The aprons are a significant one. But really, it boils down to one team, the defending champions currently laying waste to the entire league. The Oklahoma City Thunder have fundamentally broken the trade market, at least for pricey, high-risk stars like Antetokounmpo.\nThe Clippers are proof of that. They're what happens when you get one of these trades wrong. The Spurs don't want to send Harper to Milwaukee only to watch him grow into the next Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Hawks don't want to give up a pick that could very easily land at No. 1 on lottery night. And nobody wants to sit through the agony of year after year after year of surrendering draft assets to a team that's far better than you. The recent track record of this sort of trade strongly favors the team giving away the superstar, not the one acquiring him. That suggests that the star trade market -- far more favorable to buyers for most of NBA history -- has shifted toward sellers over the previous decade or so. The Durant trade to Phoenix supports that notion, and now, the league seems to be course-correcting.But there was one other condition that convinced the Clippers and Suns to make those trades, and it's a condition that doesn't exist for any prospective Antetokounmpo seekers: a wide-open league. The Clippers traded for George when one of the reigning NBA finalists, Golden State, had just lost one superstar to injury and another to free agency, while the other, Toronto, was about to lose its best player in Kawhi Leonard to the Clippers themselves. On the day the Suns traded for Durant in February of 2023, the best team in the NBA (the 39-16 Celtics) were on only a 58-win pace. These teams could credibly tell convince themselves those moves made them the championship favorite.And no feasible Giannis trade can do the same for anyone else because, short of unforeseen injuries, there is nothing anyone can do to build a plausible favorite over the Thunder. Oklahoma City is by no means an automatic champion. Such a thing doesn't exist. But the price Antetokounmpo will surely extract can only be justified by a championship, and anyone's odds of beating the Thunder, now or later, with or without him, are precariously low.\nWhy the Giannis trade pool could be smallHow many teams are a Giannis away from competing with the Thunder over the next two or three years? It's not an especially long list. The Knicks, obviously, but the Bucks would rather trade with almost anyone else. The Nuggets have even less to offer than New York does, and the Lakers aren't far above either. \n        \n            \n                Giannis Antetokounmpo mock trades: What potential offers from Knicks, Lakers, Warriors could look like\n                \n                    Sam Quinn                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nCleveland is an interesting wild card here. Last year's success -- the Cavs even beat the Thunder head-to-head! -- suggests that there's a champion in here somewhere. This year's struggles suggest they've regressed. With Evan Mobley in place, Cleveland has a fairly high floor for the next 5-7 years. They have a young All-NBA player. They'll always be good. But if they suspect their window to be great is here and now, while Donovan Mitchell is in his prime, there's an argument to be made for swapping Mobley for Antetokounmpo, dominating a weak Eastern Conference and putting all of your chips into the present instead of banking on a future in which the conference gets better and you, as Mitchell ages and the picks you spent to get him convey to other teams, start to get worse. Of course, the calculus here isn't that simple. Cleveland is $22 million above the second apron. The Cavaliers would have to get below it for a trade to be realistic. That means gutting their depth, one of the things that made them special last season.Golden State has given the Thunder issues in the past. It's also an organization with an unusually short-term focus. The Warriors tried two timelines and failed. The impetus now is to give Stephen Curry a real chance at championship No. 5. That's why they traded for Jimmy Butler a year ago. It's why they should put every draft pick they own -- along with Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski -- on the table for Antetokounmpo now. Those picks are valuable, but they're a mystery box. Nobody knows where they'll land. They aren't the sure thing that a player like Castle or Harper or even a pick in the upcoming draft like Atlanta's represents. It'd be a good offer, but not a great one.\nMost of the teams with realistic short-term ambitions against the Thunder -- the Spurs, the Rockets, the Pistons, maybe the Hawks if you squint -- also have realistic long-term ambitions against the Thunder. Take Houston for instance. Say the Rockets built a trade around Alperen Sengun, Fred VanVleet's contract and a mountain of draft picks. By building around a 31-year-old Antetokounmpo and a 37-year-old Durant, they would in effect be announcing that they think their best shot at the Thunder will come in the next few years. That's not to say they'll collapse afterward. They'd still have Amen Thompson, Jabari Smith and Reed Sheppard for their future. But those three on market-rate contracts without Sengun or spare draft picks to trade probably won't be able to stand up to the Thunder in a few years, because the Thunder didn't have to throw a bunch of long-term assets into getting this good. They did so organically. The Rockets can do that too, and they can even preserve their assets for a moment at which the Thunder appear more vulnerable. Maybe there's a season in which they do face catastrophic injuries. Or, more likely, one in which the aprons compromise their depth. Go all-in now and you can't do it later. You're already great now. How much better do you stand to get by adding a high-maintenance player in his 30s in the middle of a season to a roster he doesn't really fit?The Spurs, Hawks and Pistons are probably asking themselves versions of these same questions. Why is now the time? The Spurs have three potential stars that are still on rookie deals. They might never have to make another big move. They could just wait the Thunder out from a cap perspective. The aprons will come for Oklahoma City before San Antonio. The Pistons and Hawks are so new to this level of contention. Cade Cunningham hasn't won a playoff series yet. The Hawks are just finding themselves without Trae Young, which may well be the template they choose to build on moving forward. They both excel in the areas Antetokounmpo would figure to contribute to the most. The Pistons outscore opponents by a gaudy 13.1 points per game in the paint. The Hawks score the fourth-most fast-break points in the league. Detroit has been among the NBA's best defenses for roughly a calendar year now. The Hawks are ranked in the top 10 defensively for the first time since they drafted Young.\nThat isn't to say these teams wouldn't have any motivation to chase Antetokounmpo. There's plenty. If the Spurs are at all worried about Wembanyama's long-term health given the track record for players of his size, you could argue that they should strike while they have the chance. Atlanta and Detroit play in a laughable Eastern Conference. If they can take advantage of it and score relatively easy paths to the Finals, the Western Conference bloodbath might weaken the Thunder or whoever beats them enough to set up a championship.But there's a push and pull to all of this. Cost vs. reward. The teams the Bucks would probably like to trade with are teams that frankly don't need to make this sort of trade. They can all feel relatively confident in their long-term prospects, so why make such a substantial bet on the short-term when there's a behemoth like the Thunder lurking in May or June? Why not see if something, anything, creates the sort of wide-open path to a title that the Clippers and Suns felt they had rather than poking the 23-1 bear? And if nothing does weaken the Thunder? Well, you deal with that in a few years. Your assets aren't going anywhere unless you give them to the Bucks. There are so many ways a trade of that size can go wrong -- injuries, fit issues, underestimating your competition, luck -- that you're probably likelier to regret such a move than you are passing on one.And that's what informs trade value for someone this good. The risk of paying what the Suns did for Durant or the Clippers did for George is substantial. You do so because the potential reward outweighs it. If it didn't for the Suns and Clippers, who fought on relatively level playing fields, then what are the odds that it does for anyone in Oklahoma City's world? Does anyone really want to be the team that bets its best assets against the Thunder?\nThere will be teams that try. But the ones with the players and picks the Bucks probably want most are the ones likeliest to draw a line in the sand. The Bucks need something like Dylan Harper or Stephon Castle more than the Spurs need Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Bucks are looking for a team that needs Antetokounmpo as badly as they need a historic return for him, and most of those teams aren't capable of providing one. That means for a trade to happen, some sort of compromise is necessary. It will be a difficult pill for the Bucks to swallow, but unless one of these asset-rich teams decides the Thunder are beatable here and now, it's one they should probably start preparing for.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Yesterday, we handed out quarter-season awards for the 2025-26 NBA season. That process is more of a starting gun for the races than a definitive prediction for who will win. At the risk of tarnishing my own credibility, I went 2-for-6 in last year's version of the exercise.The All-Star and All-NBA picks are a bit different. All-Star voting will begin in a few weeks. Assuming health, we can be reasonably confident in a pretty sizable chunk of the All-NBA teams. Nikola Jokić has a long way to go to win MVP, but a meteor would have to hit Denver to keep him off of anyone's All-NBA ballots. We still have plenty of time left in the season, but All-Star and All-NBA, just by virtue of having more slots, are a bit easier to predict.So below, I will pick my All-Star and All-NBA Teams to this point in the season. As a reminder, we've had a few format changes to both in the past few years. The All-Star Game, for instance, will be divided between Americans and international players. The American team gets at least 16 players, and the international team gets at least eight. However, that isn't how All-Star teams will be chosen. The rosters will be picked by conference, as they always have, with the commissioner adding choices to whichever side needs them to reach those numbers. There are no longer any positional requirements for rosters. If we want 12 centers, we can pick 12 centers.Positional requirements have also been eliminated from All-NBA voting. More importantly, the league has added a 65-game minimum for All-NBA eligibility. Given how early it is in the season, though, we'll ignore it for the time being. So long as a player has not missed 18 games, he is eligible for selection. However, just because someone is eligible does not mean that missed time can't be held against them. With all of this in mind, let's make some picks\nAll-NBA First TeamShai Gilgeous-Alexander, ThunderNikola Jokić, NuggetsLuka Dončić, LakersGiannis Antetokounmpo, BucksCade Cunningham, PistonsThis is not coincidentally my to-date MVP ballot, listed in order. You can find my rationale for the order in that story, for All-NBA purposes, we're splitting these five players into three tiers.Jokić and Gilgeous-Alexander lead the pack. They're absolute no-brainers. If the season ended today, Jokić would set new NBA records for BPM and PER. Gilgeous-Alexander would set new records for EPM and Win Shares per 48 minutes. Looking for more conventional stats? Jokić is leading the league in rebounds and assists, at least among qualified players. Gilgeous-Alexander is flirting with one point per minute, which only Wilt Chamberlain and Joel Embiid have ever done. They'd have to lose a limb between now and the end of the season to miss out on the First Team.Dončić is just below them, but a lock all the same. He's on track to join the league's very exclusive list of 35-point per game scorers. Only Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Rick Barry, Kobe Bryant and James Harden have ever done it. Dončić leads all of them in assists. Our last lock is Antetokounmpo, who would be setting the PER record if Jokić didn't exist. All the same, he's scoring and assisting more per minute than he ever has while posting bonkers rim-protection numbers. He's our most vulnerable candidate yet for the 65-game rule, but that's April's problem. For now, he quite obviously has been one of the best four players in the league.\nThere are four plausible candidates for the fifth slot. Victor Wembanyama has probably been the best of them, but he's played the least and San Antonio has thrived without him. The real conversation is between three guards drafted in a two-year span: Cade Cunningham, Tyrese Maxey and Anthony Edwards.Maxey's scoring volume has been downright historic, and so is the sheer magnitude of his workload. He's flirting with 40 minutes per game! He might break the tracking era's touches per game record. He has players on his team who can create shots, but everyone seems more comfortable with this arrangement. After years of playing second fiddle to bigger names, this is Maxey's team now, and he's thriving. He's also pretty vulnerable defensively. You would be too at his size and with his offensive responsibility, but it counts. Edwards is bigger and has a bit more offensive support, so he can expend some more energy defensively. But he's not the playmaker the other two candidates are. He's growing in that respect, but he has the most offensive support of the three, and being better than Maxey defensively isn't saying much.Cunningham is the most balanced of the three. He's been the best defender, he leads the group in assists and rebounds, and he's probably playing with the least talented offensive roster of them all. So many Detroit possessions, especially late in games, rest on Cunningham getting into the paint. It'd be nice if he was making his 3s, but he's made up for that with great mid-range shooting. And if you're looking for a tiebreaker, a No. 1 seed should more than do it.\nAll-NBA Second TeamTyrese Maxey, 76ersAnthony Edwards, TimberwolvesStephen Curry, WarriorsJaylen Brown, CelticsVictor Wembanyama, SpursMaxey and Edwards missed out on the First-Team nod, but they're easy picks here. Edwards has seemingly found the ideal shot-diet balance. His 3-point volume isn't quite as high as it was last season, but he's traded those in for more free throws and more shots in the paint. He's not fully dismissing mid-range shots either. It was a reasonable regular-season approach last year as the Timberwolves incorporated Julius Randle, but he's also a superstar, and those are going to be the looks that are available to him late in games. He has to have a bit more comfort taking and making them, and he's developing it.Wembanyama is another easy choice. He is averaging more blocks per game alone than any other player is averaging combined blocks and steals. No center is deflecting more passes per game. Oh yea, and he's averaging a cool 26 points, 13 rebounds and four assists per game. Like Edwards, shot-selection has been criticial. He's down from around nine 3s per game to five. That's close to the right number. He can make them, but he's also 7-5 (and that's being conservative). He needed to spend more time in the paint and he's done so. He's shooting 76% in the restricted area. At his volume, only Antetokounmpo is better.If Stephen Curry is healthy and Currying, he's making an All-NBA Team. All of the old standbys remain true. He leads the league in 3s made per game. Golden State's offense dies when he goes to the bench as usual, but the reserves are at least making up for that defensively. There are signs of aging if you squint for them. He's below 40% from 3 for the second straight season. He's ceded playmaking duties almost entirely to Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler. But the guy is 37, and it's not as though every sign of aging is working against him. He has his best free-throw rate in five years and is scoring more in the paint than he has in the last three. All in all, it's a mostly standard Curry season.\nTwo players fought for the final spot: Donovan Mitchell and Jaylen Brown. Their resumes are eerily similar. As of this writing, they are the NBA's fourth- and sixth-leading scorers. Mitchell has cranked his 3-point volume up to new, almost historic heights. Brown is having one of the most efficient mid-range shooting seasons in recent memory. Can you name the last player besides Kevin Durant to take at least six mid-range shots per game and make half of them? Dirk Nowitzki. Brown is on the borderline right now and reaches the 50% threshold by making two of his next three. He never quite developed a left hand, but he's mastered just about everything else the Celtics ever could have asked for. He's setting a new career-high in assists. He's getting to the line more than ever.And he's doing this without Jayson Tatum. That's the difference-maker. Mitchell has also done an admirable job of soldiering through injuries, but his front office didn't gut his roster to avoid the second apron. Think about who Brown is missing compared to last season. It's not just Tatum. It's Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, Kristaps Porziņģis and Luke Kornet. He has half of a roster. It hasn't mattered. The Celtics have a better record than the Cavaliers thus far. Most of that credit belongs to Brown.All-NBA Third TeamDonovan Mitchell, CavaliersJalen Brunson, KnicksAustin Reaves, LakersKevin Durant, RocketsAlperen Sengun, RocketsIt says quite a bit that Mitchell has been better statistically this season than he was last by just about any measure, yet he dips from the First Team to the Third. Cleveland's decline has played a part in that. Mitchell is frankly swimming in a different pool than he was last season. His numbers could be hand-waved pretty easily. He was ceding possessions to Darius Garland and Evan Mobley for one of the best offenses of all time. There was never any doubt that he could turn it on when needed. But he got to pick his spots last season, and he deserved credit for being willing to do so. The star who can comfortably fit onto a great team is just harder to find than the star shouldering the burden for the good one.\nJalen Brunson is striking that balance this season. He sacrificed some scoring volume last season to accommodate Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns. He's clawed back some of that volume, but even if the numbers say he's the same player he was, the eye-test confirms he's grown in subtle ways. The Knicks have improved from 18th in the NBA in passes per game to 9th. They've completely inverted their shot-profile, jumping from 27th to sixth in 3-point attempts per game. There's so much more intention behind their movement. The cuts are faster. Mike Brown may have implemented all of this, but Brunson's buy-in makes it possible. If the face of the franchise jogs off of the ball and takes the wrong shots, that trickles down to everyone else. But Brunson has done his part, making the subtle changes he's needed to in order to empower his teammates in this bigger shift. He was already an All-NBA player, but that's going to be the ticket to the playoff success he and the Knicks are still seeking.Austin Reaves is almost Brunson's statistical double. Reaves averages 0.4 more points and 0.3 more assists per game. He's shooting slightly better all over the court. And they've succeeded for largely similar reasons. It's all craft, not speed with their driving games. Where Reaves has stood out this season is his strength. Brunson grifts for his free throws. Reaves does too, but he's added so much bulk that he's much more freely initiating contact and finishing in traffic. Is he better than Brunson? Not quite yet. Brunson has more mouths to feed. He's more of a point guard, managing a game and his teammates with a bit more experience. But Reaves is moving in that direction. Nobody thought Brunson would be an All-NBA player. Reaves reached this level faster. It feels fitting that they've both shared Luka Dončić as a teammate.We round out our All-NBA Teams with two players from arguably the second-best team in the league. The two support one another quite a bit. While Sengun's finishing near the rim has thankfully improved after last year's bizarre swoon, everything else inside the arc has been a bit underwhelming. Space is at a premium in Houston, so that isn't terribly surprising, but having another elite scorer next to him eases that burden meaningfully. On paper, this looks like any other Kevin Durant season. He's averaging 25 points and flirting with 50-40-90 shooting while playing strong defense. But his isolation efficiency is down to the 55th percentile league-wide. It hasn't gotten that low since 2009, his second season in the league.\nThey balance one another out. Durant has never been at his best running an offense, but Sengun's playmaking and the style his size and rebounding facilitates allows Durant to focus more on what he does best: making shots. And having Durant there to make shots opens up those tiny little nooks and crannies near the basket that weren't there a year ago, and Sengun has taken advantage. They're a great match, and together, they've made the Rockets a genuine championship contender.Eastern Conference All-StarsStartersCade Cunningham, PistonsTyrese Maxey, 76ersDonovan Mitchell, CavaliersJaylen Brown, CelticsGiannis Antetokounmpo, BucksReservesJalen Brunson, KnicksJalen Johnson, HawksKarl-Anthony Towns, KnicksFranz Wagner, MagicBam Adebayo, HeatScottie Barnes, RaptorsJalen Duren, PistonsWe don't need to spend too much time with the starters since we covered them above. The only debate was Mitchell vs. Brunson for the final slot, and it wasn't an especially difficult one. Mitchell's just been a hair better across the board. More has been asked of him from the somewhat depleted Cavaliers, yet he's been more efficient across the board, and he's always been the superior defender. The advanced metrics prefer him. Brunson's only meaningful edge is in the standings, but it's far too early and the Cavaliers have dealt with far too many injuries to hold that against Mitchell.Things get more interesting afterward. There are only two, no doubt about it locks. The first is Jalen Johnson. I'll be honest, I never figured him for a 50-40-90 candidate, but right now, it's only the free throws holding him back. That's how well-rounded he's been this season. We always knew he'd be a beast in transition, but he's never been this complete an offensive player. The guy who averaged 2.2 assists per game in college never struck me as an eventual point guard replacement for Trae Young, but he's generating more points off of assists (20.5) than he scored in any season prior to this one. His rim scoring is predictably awesome. The only thing he's really missing at this point is the ability to create and make his own jumpers inside of the arc late in games. He's developed everything else, so who knows, maybe we'll check back in a year and he'll have that too.\nTowns is having a down shooting year, but he's made up for it was a reasonably strong defensive season by his standards. The defensive metrics strangely adore him. He has the same D-EPM as Dyson Daniels and Draymond Green, and while that's a stretch to say the least, his rim-protection numbers have improved markedly on last season. Does that mean he's improved substantially and there won't be issues in the postseason? No. But he's fitting in, at least. After last year's rumblings about him going off-scheme, that's an improvement. If only he'd stop fouling everything that moves.The last four slots get a bit harder to figure out. I ultimately gave one of them to Franz Wagner, who would have been a lock before his high-ankle sprain set him up to lose potentially a month. For the second consecutive season, Wagner has kept the Magic afloat after a Paolo Banchero injury. This time, there's really no ambiguity. Wagner has been the best player on the team. He's outpaced Banchero in just about every respect, and now that he's making 3s again, there's a bit more reason for optimism in their long-term partnership. If the shooting and foul-drawing sustain, he's not going to cede this All-Star spot for a long, long time.The first time Scottie Barnes made an All-Star team, it came during a suspicious jump in 3-point percentage that had already begun to slip. I'm a bit more optimistic about this year's shooting improvement. It's coming all over the floor. The long 2s might not be sustainable for anyone, but when you're having your best 3-point, mid-range and free throw shooting seasons of your career at the same time, well, that suggests you changed something significant. I can't deny someone shooting this well and defending at the level Barnes is. \nThree players fought for the last two spots. One of them was a Piston, Jalen Duren. Two of them were... Heatles? Heats? What do you call a singular member of the Heat? Anyway they were Bam Adebayo and Norm Powell. This creates a classic All-Star conundrum: can you take two players from one good team when you only have one from a great team? I tend to believe that you can. Teams can win for different reasons. The Pistons aren't necessarily the No. 1 seed on the strength of two players. It's a group effort. I'm open to the concept of taking both Powell and Adebayo. I just couldn't ultimately get there.Powell is having a remarkable scoring season. He's been better than he was during last year's All-Star push with the Clippers, and with Tyler Herro injured, the importance of that scoring can't be understated. But isn't the point of Miami's revamped offense to create mismatches for everyone? The Heat have five 15-point scorers. Everyone is making their 3s. I just can't help but feel as though the system deserves just as much credit as the players for Miami's offensive success here. We can't just dismiss Adebayo either. Is Powell that much more important offensively now that Adebayo is consistently making 3s? Because Adebayo makes Miami's defensive success possible. He's the organizational culture-setter. I just can't shake the idea that as well as Powell has played, this team works because it has Bam Adebayo. There are more guards that can do what Powell can do than there are bigs that can do what Adebayo does.Duren feels just as irreplaceable for Detroit. This team wins in the paint. Period. End of story. They outscore opponents by 13 points per game there. Duren is the backbone of that interior dominance, and he's a bigger part of that offense than most realize. Over 40% of his field goals are unassisted. That's better than Caris LeVert, a guard who came into the league as an individual creator. At the end of the day, Duren and Adebayo felt like good scorers and more complete players than Powell, a great scorer with less to offer elsewhere. But hey, if Wagner drops out due to missed games, Powell is certainly ready to fill in.\nWestern Conference All-StarsStartersShai Gilgeous-Alexander, ThunderStephen Curry, WarriorsLuka Doncić, LakersAnthony Edwards, TimberwolvesNikola Jokić, NuggetsReservesVictor Wembanyama, SpursKevin Durant, RocketsAlperen Sengun, RocketsAustin Reaves, LakersChet Holmgren, ThunderDeni Avdija, Trail BlazersJamal Murray, NuggetsAs usual, the West is a good bit deeper than the East. Only six of our All-NBA slots went to Eastern Conference players, which means we've already covered nine of our 12 Western Conference All-Stars. The only meaningful distinction between Wembanyama and the other Second-Team choices starting above him is games played. If he closes that gap between now and February, he'll deservingly make the jump into the opening five.As for the three players left, they slot in pretty neatly. One was obvious. The next was relatively easy. The final slot was difficult. Chet Holmgren is a no-brainer and likely would've been my first All-NBA alternate. He's still only scratching the surface of what he can do as an individual creator, but man, has he gotten better at feasting on the looks his teammates give him. He's shooting over 80% on shots within three feet of the rim and over 60% between three and 10 feet of the rim. Give him the ball near the basket and good things are going to happen. Give someone on the other team the ball near the basket and he'll prevent them from scoring. Toss in his team's nearly spotless record and he's an easy pick.Deni Avdija wasn't quite as simple, but he's got a leg up on the four candidates we'll cover fighting for the 12th slot. There are just no blemishes on his resume. An ultra-efficient 26 points per game while playing point guard in place of Jrue Holiday and doing his part defensively? The only thing working against him is his team's record, but the on-off numbers wipe that away quickly. Portland wins the Avdija minutes and gets slaughtered when he rests. His free throw rate has jumped almost 15 percentage points. He's having the best 3-point shooting season of his career by both volume and percentage. There's just no compelling reason to leave him off, even with more famous candidates behind him.That leaves one slot left for Jamal Murray, Devin Booker, Lauri Markkanen and Jimmy Butler. Markkanen is the Western Conference equivalent of Powell. Incredible scorer. Not doing enough other stuff to qualify in the better conference. Butler, as always, is the metrics darling of the group. He's helped sustain the dominant defense Golden State built after the deadline a season ago as well, and I'm pretty sure he's the only Warrior I've seen attempt a free throw this season. But I can't get over how far the offense falls when Stephen Curry rests. Adding another star was supposed to make the bench offense at least somewhat viable. Even Butler couldn't fix it. As the one constant in Phoenix, it feels a bit unfair not to reward Devin Booker for the turnaround the Suns are enjoying this season. The tangible numbers just aren't there, at least in relation to Jamal Murray. They're scoring roughly similar amounts. One is doing so just above 50% effective shooting and the other is doing so just below 60% effective shooting. If this were Booker carrying the team in other ways, that might give him an edge, but the Suns have been better when he's been on the bench this season, and it's far easier to credit Dillon Brooks for the culture improvement considering his track record in Houston. So that leaves Murray to become the first All-Star teammate of Jokić's career.For those of you keeping track, our demographics are a bit out of whack. We need 16 Americans, but even if we assume Towns, who has played for the Dominican National Team but grew up in New Jersey, counts as American, we're still one short. Now, in reality, this creates a potentially very messy situation. Why? Because we haven't accounted for the possibility that LeBron James gets voted in yet. If he does, everyone in the West gets knocked down a slot, meaning Murray, the 12th man, gets bumped without an international slot open to be filled. Now, the obvious counter to that is that Wagner may miss too much time to get chosen, opening an international slot for him to sneak into on the other side, but for our purposes, we're going to ignore all of that. Our list was one American short, so we're going to pick one American.So that's how we'll reward the Suns for their feel-good start to the season. Booker may not have been an original Western Conference choice, but he'll sneak onto the team here. Now, does that mean he'll make it in reality? The James factor is complicating, but we also haven't accounted for injury-related absences. When the dust settles, there's a good chance he's ultimately selected. If he's not, well, it's probably because the Suns have regressed to their preseason expectations.\n            ",

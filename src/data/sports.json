Florida and Arkansas have two of the best offenses in college basketball. Arkansas ranks second in scoring at 90.3 points per game, with Florida 16th at 86.3 ppg.

Before then, Los Angeles fell to the Magic at the buzzer and lost to Boston, 111-89, at home. The Lakers were favored against the Magic and Suns and only 1.5-point underdogs against Boston, as they've underperformed in recent games that the sportsbooks expected them to win. The model projects that formula to repeat itself Saturday with the Warriors winning as underdogs. The Warriors are 31-28 this season compared to the Lakers' 34-24 mark, but the Warriors are 19-11 at home this season.

    "body": "\nFormer major league pitcher Dan Serafini has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 2021 shooting of his wife's parents at their home in Lake Tahoe, according to the Associated Press. Serafini was found guilty of first-degree murder of his father-in-law, Gary Spohr, and attempted murder of his mother-in-law, Wendy Wood.Wood survived a gunshot wound to the head but needed extensive rehabilitation. She died by suicide a year later, her daughter, Adrienne Spohr, told KCRA. Serafini is married to Erin Spohr, who testified during the trial.\"Dan Serafini executed my dad and left my mom to die,\" Adrienne Spohr told reporters following Serafini's sentencing, according to the Sacramento Bee. \"My mom fought with everything she could and did not let Dan Serafini win. Dan Serafini is finally being held accountable and will spend the rest of his life behind bars.\"Prosecutors said Serafini hated his wife's parents and offered $20,000 to whoever would carry out the killings. He broke into their home and waited for them to return before carrying out the shootings. Serafini described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes\" during his sentencing, according to My News NBC 4.\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate  victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and  highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" District Attorney Morgan Gire said Friday.Serafini, 51, was convicted in July 2025. Several motions for a new trial were denied.A first-round pick in 1992, Serafini appeared in seven seasons with the Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds, and Colorado Rockies from 1996-2007. He also pitched in Japan, Mexico, and Taiwan, and for Italy in the 2009 and 2013 World Baseball Classics.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Statistically speaking, when Cade Cunningham fouled out with just under two minutes to play on Friday, the Pistons, down six after Jarrett Allen made his two free throws, had less than a 9% chance of coming back to beat the Cavaliers. It wasn't an offensive clinic by any stretch without Cunningham, but the Pistons, thanks in large part to Craig Craig Porter Jr. and Evan Mobley each shanking a potentially game-icing free throw, managed to scrap their way to a three-point deficit with possession and 6.5 seconds remaining. Which, for Cleveland, brought about one of the modern game's most polarizing dilemmas: To foul, or not foul, with a three-point lead in the closing seconds of a game. The analytics say foul every time, but coaches are a conservative, paranoid bunch, and a lot of them choose to play out the defensive possession and concede a game-tying attempt rather than risk fouling a shooter in the act and giving up three free throws. On Friday, Kenny Atkinson took the risk. And burned the Cavs big time when Detroit's Daniss Jenkins alertly went into his shooting motion from beyond half court just as Jaylon Tyson made intentional contact with him. \nNikola Jokic loves to do this, launching into a shot from a mile away whenever he senses contact coming to try to steal three free throws. It's basically a gimmick and officials are wired not to fall for it. They are going to call this foul on the ground every time unless the contact lines up perfectly with the shooting motion, which almost never happens. But take a closer look, and you'll see this time it actually did. So Jenkins, who just had his two-way contract converted to a standard NBA deal, got the three free throws with 4.7 seconds to play, and credit to him for knocking them down. That takes some onions. Jenkins didn't have a good shooting night, but nobody cares now, as he helped Detroit force overtime, where they won 122-119. \nFor Cleveland, even though they were kind of playing with house money with Donovan Mitchell and James Harden out on the road against the East's No. 1 seed, that's about as rough a way to lose as possible. The question is going to be asked: Did Atkinson make the right call by having the Cavs foul up three? The answer, without hesitation, is yes. \nBut I have a different question: Why does the NBA continue to allow these 'up-three' intentional fouls? It goes completely against the spirit of the rule. Fouls are supposed to hurt the offending team, or help the offended, however you want to look at it. In this case, the reverse happens. Imagine if a football team, up six with one second to play, could just jump offsides to keep the offense from attempting a game-tying pass to the end zone. No, all that would happen is the offense would move closer. Same thing, basically. If the tying run is at the plate, even if you intentionally walk, you eventually have to throw a pitch to someone. You have to give them their chance to tie the game. But in the NBA, you can just take that opportunity away by committing an act that is supposed to punish you. It makes zero sense. It robs the fans, who are already getting ripped off by the price they pay to watch the game, of what could be the most entertaining part of their experience. Nobody pays to watch free throws. \nThe league knows this, by the way. That's why it punishes intentional fouls when a team is doing it with under two minutes to play to force a bad free-throw shooter to go to the line. If you do it, it's two free throws plus the ball back. So guess what: Nobody does it. And we get to watch actual basketball in the closing minutes. The same logic should be applied to these 'up-three' fouls. Two free throws plus possession. Believe me, you will never see an 'up-three' intentional foul again. And don't tell me these officials, who are the best in the world at what they do, cannot be trusted to use their judgment as to what is and isn't an intentional foul. Literally, their entire job is based on judgment. Everyone in that building knew Tyson's foul was coming on Friday. Jenkins was so sure he was going to be fouled that he launched up a shot from 60 feet. This isn't hard. \nBut fine, if you want to take the burden off officials deeming what is and isn't intentional, here it is: If you foul away from the ball, or anywhere outside the 3-point line on the ball, with less than 10 seconds remaining, it's three free throws. It doesn't matter if the foul is on the ground. Three free throws. Them's the breaks. Put this rule in, and the very next night, 'up-three' intentional fouls will be eliminated. In this way, I'm glad the Cavs at least got burned by the strategy on Friday. To be clear, as long as the league is going to let teams get away with this, it's smart to do it. It's a lot harder to make two free throws, then miss the last one intentionally, then get the rebound, then go back up and score a second-chance basket, than it is to just make one 3-pointer. So why give an opponent a shot at the latter? Teams are not going to think in terms of doing right by the fans. They're going to think in terms of competitive advantage, and nothing else. It's the league's job to serve the people who pay its bills. Here's hoping that one day somebody in the league office comes to their senses and changes this end-of-game loophole -- but until then, here's hoping more teams get burned, as the Cavs did on Friday night. Every time that happens, it will at least make the next coach think twice. \n            ",

Jiri Prochazka and Carlos Ulberg will battle for the vacant light heavyweight championship inside Kaseya Center in Miami on April 11. UFC president and CEO Dana White made the fight official with an announcement on Friday night.The title was vacated by Alex Pereira, who was on his second run as light heavyweight champion after having previously held the middleweight title, in anticipation of a move to the heavyweight division.Prochazka is aiming for his own second stint as champion at 205 pounds, having previously won the title with a win over Glover Teixeira at UFC 275. Prochazka lost the belt in his first defense, suffering a TKO defeat to Pereira. Prochazka then lost a rematch for the title against Pereira two fights later.Prochazka has been perfect in his UFC career outside of the two defeats to Pereira, compiling a 6-2 record in the Octagon with all victories coming via stoppage. He has won back-to-back fights, stopping Jamahal Hill via TKO and then scoring a dramatic comeback knockout of Khalil Rountree Jr. this past October.\nUlberg stumbled in his UFC debut, suffering a knockout loss to Kennedy Nzechukwu. Since that loss, Ulberg has rattled off nine consecutive victories, most recently knocking out Dominick Reyes in a UFC Fight Night main event.\nProchazka and Ulberg sit at No. 2 and 3, respectively, in the official UFC light heavyweight rankings, sitting only behind No. 1 Magomed Ankalaev.Prochazka vs. Ulberg tops a card that also includes a flyweight title defense between champion Joshua Van and challenger Tatsuro Taira.White also announced on Friday that former Bellator two-division champion Patricio Pitbull would return in Miami to take on a familiar name in Aaron Pico as both men spent years with the promotion. The two will meet at featherweight on the prelims. \nHere's how the rest of the card shakes out.UFC 327 fight cardJiri Prochazka vs. Carlos Ulberg, vacant light heavyweight championshipJoshua Van (c)\tvs.\tTatsuro Taira, flyweight championshipCurtis Blaydes\tvs.\tJosh Hokit, heavyweightsBeneil Dariush vs. Manuel Torres, lightweightsDominick Reyes vs. Johnny Walker, light heavyweightsAzamat Murzakanov vs. Paulo Costa, light heavyweightsPatricio Pitbull vs. Aaron Pico, featherweightsMatuesz Gamrot vs. Esteban Ribovics, lightweightsCub Swanson vs. Nate Landwehr, featherweightsKevin Holland\tvs.\tRandy Brown, welterweightsKelvin Gastelum vs. Vicente Luque, welterweightsTatiana Suarez\tvs.\tLoopy Godinez, women's strawweightsKyle Daukaus\tvs.\tVicente Luque, middleweights Christopher Alvidrez vs. Francisco Prado welterweights\n            \n",

    "body": "\nManchester City are hoping to gain ground on leaders Arsenal in the English Premier League standings when they take on Leeds at Elland Road on Saturday. Man City (17-5-5) are five points behind the Gunners in the Premier League table with a game in hand. They are on a five-game win streak in all competitions. Leeds (7-10-10) are in 15th place but are 1-3-0 in their past four matches and have been strong at their home ground. City have won the past five meetings, by a combined score of 19-4.    Kickoff in Leeds is set for 12:30 p.m. ET. The latest Leeds vs. Manchester City odds at DraftKings Sportsbook list Manchester City as -145 favorites on the money line, while Leeds are +400 underdogs. A draw is priced at +300 and the total is set at 2.5 (Over -125, Under +100). Check out the latest SportsLine Projection Model picks for Leeds vs. Manchester City, and you need to make sure to see what expert Martin Green is betting for the match.After working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide. Last year, Green was profitable in multiple areas on his soccer betting picks, including Euro qualifying (+6.30 units), EFL Cup (+4.47), FA Cup (+3.07) and Champions League (+3.05), among others. Anyone who follows him could be way up.    Here are Green's best bets and analysis for Leeds vs. Manchester City on Saturday, Feb. 28.Leeds vs. Manchester City best betsBoth Teams to Score (-140, 1 unit)Erling Haaland to Score (-120, 0.5 units)Leeds will try to extend their unbeaten streak to five games when they host title-chasing Man City at Elland Road on Saturday.Daniel Farke's men are up to 15th in the Premier League table after battling to an impressive 1-1 draw with Aston Villa last weekend. They've picked up three wins, four draws and just one defeat in their last eight matches in all competitions.Leeds lost 4-0 to Arsenal on Jan. 31 but are unbeaten in February, so the players should be full of confidence right now. However, they face a stern test of their mettle against Pep Guardiola's rejuvenated Man City team.Semenyo signing revitalizes Man City's attackMan City are back in the Premier League title race after winning their last three games. They beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield, cruised to a 3-0 victory over Fulham, then beat Newcastle 2-1 at home last weekend.They're now just five points behind league leaders Arsenal, but they have a game in hand. The title race could go down to the wire, so this is a must-win game for Man City. The Citizens have won five games in a row in all competitions. They're unbeaten since losing to Man United in mid-January, so they're building momentum at the perfect time in the season.City's season was faltering, but the club made two shrewd signings in the January transfer window. Antoine Semenyo, the standout attacking player in the Premier League this season, joined from Bournemouth. City then bolstered their defense by snapping up Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi.The results have been immediate. They now look stronger at the back and more dangerous in attack, so they look well-placed to win another Premier League title this season. However, their away form has been their Achilles' heel. Man City have only won six of their 13 away games this season, with 22 goals scored and 16 conceded.They beat Liverpool at Anfield in their last away match, but they were winless in their previous three away games -- a 2-2 draw with Spurs, a 2-0 defeat to Man United, and a 0-0 draw with Sunderland. City also lost 3-1 on the road against Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League, so they don't travel well. They'll need big performances from key players like Erling Haaland, Bernardo Silva, and Gianluigi Donnarumma if they're to beat Leeds at Elland Road.Leeds are strong at homeElland Road has been a fortress for Leeds this season. They've picked up 1.69 points per game at home (six wins, four draws, three defeats).By contrast, Leeds have only earned 0.64 points per game on the road (one win, six draws, seven defeats). It shows just how crucial the Elland Road crowd is for this team. The home fans create a raucous, intimidating atmosphere, which the Leeds players feed on in big games. Farke's men have taken four wins, two draws, and just two defeats from their last eight home games.That's why they're now six points clear of the relegation zone. They look capable of avoiding relegation, but they need to keep picking up points at Elland Road.Leeds only have six home matches remaining this season, so this will be another crucial game for the team. Farke is only missing one player, forward Noah Okafor, so he will field a strong starting XI for this game.The likes of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Brendan Aaronson could cause problems for a Man City team that has only kept four clean sheets on the road this season. However, it's hard to see Leeds keeping Haaland, Semenyo, Rayan Cherki, Tijani Reijnders, Nico O'Reilly, Omar Marmoush, and Phil Foden at bay for 90 minutes.It finished 3-2 to Man City when these teams met in Manchester earlier this season, and both teams to score should pay off again at Elland Road this weekend.Haaland has scored three goals in his last two games. He's up to 42 goals in 43 matches for club and country this season, so he looks well-priced to find the back of the net on Saturday.\n            ",

The Spanish giants are currently at the top of the standings with a one-point margin over Real Madrid and a ten-point gap to Villarreal, one of the most positive surprises in LaLiga's season so far. During the pre-match press conference, Flick revealed an interesting detail on why he stopped benching players who arrived late to training, as was hinted at by both Pedri and Ferran Torres over the week. \"Before, it was stressful because I'd look at the clock when there were 60 seconds left and think, 'Let's see when they'll arrive.' It's something I don't like because it's also pressure for me, so I decided to talk to the captains and leave the decision up to them. Since then, no one has been late, so I guess we made the right decision.\" Here's what you need to know ahead of the game.How to watch Barcelona vs. Villarreal, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 28 | Time: 10:15 a.m. ETLocation: Spotify Camp Nou -- BarcelonaLive stream: ESPN+Odds: FC Barcelona -332; Draw +531; Villarreal +694Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

    "body": "\n        CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — A big 'ol party erupted in the bowels of the State Farm Center just moments after No. 3 Michigan dominated No. 10 Illinois 84-70 Friday to clinch the Big Ten regular-season championship outright. Michigan coach Dusty May was chest-bumping anybody and everybody he could find. Aday Mara, a 7-foot-3 mountain of a man, galloped down the ramp smacking his ring finger, begging for his championship hardware. Illinois transfer Morez Johnson, who endured three hours of tongue-lashing and a barrage of, uh, unkind texts after his phone number was leaked, carried his Big Ten Championship trophy into the opposing locker room like a king with his prize. In the middle of the madhouse, Nimari Burnett could only think of one term that's littered across Michigan's walls: \"Those who stay will be champions.\" The all-time phrase was coined by Bo Schembechler, Michigan's Hall of Fame football coach, and it embodies plenty of what makes this Michigan group tick.Two years ago, Burnett and Will Tschetter had to sit in this exact locker room in Champaign and stare at the walls after a 97-68 beatdown at the hands of Illinois All-American Terrence Shannon. It was one of many drubbings in an 8-24 season that resulted in Juwan Howard's termination.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Bubble Watch: Which teams near the NCAA Tournament cut line need a victory the most?\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \n\"We have a lot of memories in that locker room; none of them good,\" Tschetter told CBS Sports. \"For us to come back in here and get this dub in this fashion and clinch that thing outright, it means the world. Very, very cool.\"\nThe Dusty May era may have ushered in a wave of hope for Michigan basketball, but there was real consternation for both Burnett and Tschetter about what was in store with a new regime.\tDo they want us?\tWill we get to play?\"When you're on a team that's 8-24, you think,  'Oh, man, they might want to clear house,'\" Tschetter says. \"But you know, after talking with him, we were on the same wavelength. … You can't put a price on some things and this is one of those things for sure. Having the trust and the relationship with Dusty and the guys that he was gonna bring in, I truly thought we'd be Big Ten championship contenders and Final Four contenders. You can't put a price on that. So super obviously thankful for him to be a part of this.\"Burnett and Tschetter didn't just stay. They've become pillars of this squad. Burnett has started all 29 games and has embraced his 3-and-D role. Tschetter is the ninth man on some nights and the seventh man on others. His attitude doesn't appear to change regardless if he plays seven minutes or 17 like he did Friday.\nThey both knocked down treys in the second half to deliver Michigan's knockout punch.\"We kept those guys because we believed in who they are as people, first and foremost,\" May said. \"That was a tough season for Michigan basketball, and there was a handful of guys that we couldn't recruit for various reasons. And then there's a handful that we thought might fit our culture as far as work ethic and talent. They had a baseline of talent, but Nimari and Will were both guys who dove in from Day One, and they wanted Michigan to be back in this position. It was that simple.\"There was never a conversation as far as shots. As far as position. They've taken both of those guys have taken a major, major, sacrifice for this group. You know, Nimari played point guard on that team. \nNow he's probably our fifth playmaker on the team because Aday [Mara], Elliot [Cadeau], and the rest of these guys. Will Tschetter has been an absolute star from Day One with the role-playing and the daily intangibles. We wouldn't be here without those guys.\"Burnett says he knew this Michigan group was special back in September. The size, the power, the physicality. All of it. \"Although that's easy to say now,\" Burnett says with a laugh.Burnett's visions have come to life, and they were punctuated with March looming. Michigan's two-way paint dominance was on full display. Johnson was utterly unstoppable on his way to 19 points and 11 rebounds. Mara delivered maybe the best game of his season, considering the stakes. Mara dominated the second half with 19 points and numerous thunderous dunks. \nThe bully of the Big Ten added yet another thing to its ever-growing list of accomplishments. It's Michigan that is the undisputed champ. \"I stayed for days just like this,\" Burnett said. \"Believing in Dusty May. Believing in the staff, knowing that they have a great plan. know how to win at a high level, you know, and know how to maximize us as players. And that's this is what it's all about, right? It's about winning, doing it together, enjoying these moments.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2025-26 Serie A season is in full swing in Italy. Napoli started the campaign as defending champions after winning the 2024-25 title, their fourth Scudetto ever on the last matchday of the season. Inter and AC Milan will compete to win the Serie A title, while other teams such as Napoli, AS Roma, Atalanta, Juventus, Bologna and Como are all in contention for a spot in next season's European tournaments. This week's Serie A slate features some interesting matchups, such as the game between AS Roma and Juventus on Sunday in Rome. Here's what to know:A key game for JuventusAS Roma will host Juventus on Sunday in a key match for the Champions League race. The Giallorossi are on a good run under Gian Piero Gasperini and are currently in fourth place, tied on points with Napoli and only four behind AC Milan, while Juventus is in fifth place in the Serie A standings with a four-point gap on AS Roma. After a dramatic, but also disappointing Champions League elimination against Galatasaray in the playoffs, Luciano Spalletti's side is called to react at the Stadio Olimpico, with the ambition to end up in the top four spots of the table. Juventus director Giorgio Chiellini also clarified the future of Spalletti after the European elimination and said that \"there is no doubt\" he will stay beyond the end of the current season in charge of the Bianconeri, but the new contract will clearly depend on the results in the last weeks of the season, starting from Sunday's matchup against his former club. Last time these two teams met, Juventus won 2-1 at home thanks to goals from Chico Conceicao and Luis Openda.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            How to watch AS Roma vs. Juventus, oddsDate: Sunday, March 1 | Time: 2:45 p.m. ETLocation: Stadio Olimpico -- Rome Live stream: Paramount+Odds: AS Roma +155; Draw +205; Juventus +188How to watch Serie A Matchday 27All times U.S./Eastern. \nFriday, Feb. 27Parma 1, Cagliari 1Saturday, Feb. 28Como vs. Lecce, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Hellas Verona vs. Napoli, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)Inter vs. Genoa, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)Sunday, March 1Cremonese vs. AC Milan, 6:30 a.m. (Paramount+)Sassuolo vs. Atalanta, 9 a.m. (Paramount+)Torino vs. Lazio, 12 p.m. (Paramount+)AS Roma vs. Juventus, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\nMonday, March 2Pisa vs. Bologna, 12:30 p.m. (Paramount+)Udinese vs. Fiorentina, 2:45 p.m. (Paramount+)\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last day of February is packed to the brim with NCAA Tournament bubble intrigue as college basketball's regular season nears its end. Conference tournament action is set to begin in the coming days for a handful of mid-major conferences, and the high-major schools are running short on resume-padding opportunities.Against that backdrop, Saturday is pivotal. It starts with Seton Hall trying to salvage its at-large hopes at UConn and end with Saint Mary's aiming for a final bit of at-large insurance in the late-night window against Gonzaga. In between, there are myriad consequential games that will shape the picture heading into March.Among them are a couple of \"double bubble\" battles, including a showdown between New Mexico and San Diego State on CBS. The Mountain West's bid tally is up in the air, and the results of that one will influence the conference's overall outlook as we creep closer to Selection Sunday.Later on, Texas and Texas A&M square off in a rivalry showdown that carries even greater stakes than usual. With both programs on the bubble under first-year coaches, intensity will be high as the Longhorns look to even the season series with a road win.\nHere is the full rundown of the bubble picture entering Saturday's action.Last Four InCalSanta Clara TCUTexas A&MFirst Four OutNew MexicoOhio State Seton HallVCUNext Four OutIndianaStanfordUSCVirginia TechCheck out the CBS Sports Bracketology model's latest bracket at the Bracketology hub                                All times ET                 Bubble teams in action Saturday\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Seton Hallat UConn | 12 p.m. (FS1)Entering the day: First Four OutGame status: Quad 1Seton Hall has a lot of ground to make up, but beating UConn on the road would cover a nice chunk of it. This would be one of the 10 best victories posted by anyone in college basketball this season, and it would prove to the selection committee that the Pirates are worthy of a hard look. But if Seton Hall can't pull a mammoth upset, this will likely be the end of the road for the Pirates' at-large aspirations.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    VCUvs. Fordham | 12:30 p.m. (USA)Entering the day: First Four OutGame status: Quad 4\nThe Rams are an interesting case study because the average of their resume metrics is hovering in the mid-40s. Generally speaking, that's fringe at-large territory. But there isn't a single victory a projected at-large team, and VCU is just 4-7 across the top two quadrants. Playing Fordham is a nothing-burger, but it gives VCU a chance to reset the vibes after more than a week off since a disappointing loss to Saint Louis. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Missouriat Mississippi State | 1 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the day: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 2Missouri is the perfect example of why you should like at WAB instead of NET. If all you saw was Missouri's No. 58 NET ranking, you might think the Tigers have no business in the at-large conversation. But with a highly respectable No. 35 WAB ranking, Mizzou is actually in decent shape. Coming off a win over Tennessee -- its fifth Quad 1 win -- Missouri would have to fall hard down the stretch to miss the dance. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Clemsonvs. Louisville | 2 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the day: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 1Four straight losses have dropped Clemson from the ACC title race into the bubble conversation. At 10-7 across Quads 1 and 2, the Tigers are still OK for now. But facing Louisville and North Carolina (Tuesday on the road) isn't the easiest way to get back on track. Clemson likely needs to win two of its final three games to feel good entering the ACC Tournament.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New Mexicovs. San Diego State | 2 p.m. (CBS)Entering the weekend: First Four OutGame status: Quad 2\nNew Mexico dropped onto the wrong side of the bubble following a 67-60 Quad 1 loss at Nevada on Tuesday. The Lobos are hovering around 50th in results-based metrics. They will likely need to be in the mid-40s come Selection Sunday to have a realistic chance at inclusion. Any way you slice it, closing the regular season with a win at Utah State would be huge. But evening the season series with San Diego State would keep the Lobos in position along the cut line.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    San Diego Stateat New Mexico | 2 p.m. (CBS)Entering the day: No. 11 seed (auto-bid)Game status: Quad 1The Mountain West could get anywhere from 1 to 3 bids, depending on how things play out for San Diego State and New Mexico. The Aztecs are currently \"in\" the CBS Sports Bracketology field as the league's automatic bid recipient. But, from an at-large perspective, they are just 53rd in WAB and have work to do. This game is critical because it's the best game the Aztecs have left in the regular season.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    UCLAat Minnesota | 2 p.m. (FS1)Entering the day: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 1Coming off a blowout loss at Michigan State on Feb. 17, the Bruins had dropped three of five games and two straight by a combined margin of 53 points. Things appeared to be going south in a hurry. But consecutive victories over Illinois and USC have restored UCLA's tournament trajectory. If the Bruins win two of three down the stretch, they will likely head to the Big Ten Tournament in a strong position.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Georgiavs. South Carolina | 3:30 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the day: No. 9 seedGame status: Quad 3Georgia is in good shape, but a loss here would change that. Falling at home to a bad South Carolina team would bring an estimated WAB hit of roughly 0.80, which would translate to a 5-7 spot drop in WAB ranking. That would put Georgia in the low-to-mid 40s, which is close to the likely cut line. But if the Bulldogs take care of business against a team they should beat, they'll head into the final week of the regular season on solid footing.\n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    USCvs. Nebraska | 4 p.m. (Big Ten Network)Entering the day: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 1It might feel like USC is a lost cause amid a four-game losing streak. But the Trojans have consecutive Quad 1 opportunities ahead, starting Saturday against Nebraska. If they close on a three-game winning streak -- or win 2 of 3 and get some favorable results from other bubble teams -- they could still head to the Big Ten Tournament with some at-large pulse. Pulling that off is going to require some rapid improvement, though, because this team is flunking the eye test.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Californiavs. Pitt | 4 p.m. (ACC Network)Entering the day: Last Four InGame status: Quad 3\nPlaying lowly Pitt at home is nothing but a landmine for Cal. It's a no-reward, high-risk proposition, and the Bears better be ready. With wins over four projected tournament teams (UCLA, North Carolina, Miami and SMU), Cal is looking good from a resume perspective. That would change quickly if the Bears slip up against the Panthers.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texasat Texas A&M | 4 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the day: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 1Texas had Florida on the ropes until the final seven minutes on Wednesday. That's when the Gators mashed the gas pedal, showing their elite gear and leaving the Longhorns in the dust. Missing out on a potential resume-defining win was a bummer. Still, Texas should have no problem flushing that and getting up for Texas A&M. After losing its first meeting with the Aggies at home back on Jan. 17, Texas will be out for revenge in a high-intensity \"double bubble\" battle.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Texas A&Mvs. Texas | 4 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the day: Last Four InGame status: Quad 2Seeing Bucky McMillan's high-octane system back in the NCAA Tournament would be entertaining. Remember, his Samford team took Kansas down to the wire during a 2024 first-round game. Now in his first season with the Aggies, McMillan has more talent. But he still needs a couple more wins to feel safe after A&M struggled through a four-game losing skid to open February. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    TCUat Kansas State | 6:30 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the day: Last Four InGame status: Quad 2TCU has won five of its past six games to reach 18-10 (8-7 Big 12) heading into the weekend. The Horned Frogs own a resume that is all over the map. It includes wins over Florida, Wisconsin and Iowa State but losses to Notre Dame, Utah and Colorado. The demonstrated ability to beat high-caliber opposition bodes well for Jamie Dixon's club in the selection discussion, but the Horned Frogs need to win two of three down the stretch.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Santa Claravs. Oregon State | 8 p.m. (CBS Sports Network)Entering the day: Last Four InGame status: Quad 4\nSanta Clara lost at home to Gonzaga on Feb. 14 and fell at Saint Mary's on Wednesday. The Gaels needed to win one of those two games to feel safe-ish. Now they have to take care of business against Oregon State and then gear up for a potentially tense WCC Tournament. Beating the Zags or Gaels on a neutral floor would be significant for a Santa Clara team that is 1-5 in Quad 1.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Auburnvs. Ole Miss | 8:30 p.m. (SEC Network)Entering the day: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 3Generally speaking, a Quad 3 game this time of year is nothing but a needless risk for a team on the bubble. But in Auburn's case, hosting Ole Miss could be viewed as a welcome reprieve. After a stretch of six losses in seven games, Auburn just needs wins. Ole Miss is limping in on a 10-game losing streak, which should allow the Tigers to regain their footing.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Virginia Techat North Carolina | 8:30 p.m. (ESPN2)Entering the day: Next Four OutGame status: Quad 1Virginia Tech fans who have seen their team drop four of its past six games might wonder why the Hokies are still showing up in a bubble watch. But beating North Carolina on the road would send Virginia Tech surging back toward the cut line, as it would bring a projected 5-8 spot rise in WAB ranking for the Hokies. A season-ending road game at Virginia is also a big opportunity. It'll take a big upset or two, but the Hokies aren't dead yet.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Saint Mary'svs. Gonzaga | 10:30 p.m. (ESPN)Entering the day: No. 10 seedGame status: Quad 1Saint Mary's averages out as a top-30 team across both results-based and predictive metrics looked at by the selection committee. But while the Gaels are 8-1 in Quad 2, they remain winless in Quad 1. Wednesday night's 86-67 home win over Santa Clara was the best win of the season for the Gaels, which is a little concerning. Toppling Gonzaga one last time before the Bulldogs leave for the Pac-12 would make for some great insurance. Bubble teams in action Sunday\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Ohio Statevs. No. 8 Purdue | 1:30 p.m. (CBS)Entering the weekend: First Four OutGame status: Quad 1Ohio State got second-leading scorer John Mobley Jr. back from a three-game injury absence, but the Buckeyes looked flat anyway during a 74-57 loss at Iowa on Wednesday.

That's the bad news. The good news is that IU has wins over projected tournament teams Purdue, UCLA and Wisconsin.

Troy captured the Sun Belt title after defeating UL Monroe to earn the No. 1 seed in next week's tournament. Marshall earned the No. 2 seed and the bye into , and despite losing to Georgia Southern. There was a six-way tie (with 11-7 conference records) for second place in the conference standings.Because of the Sun Belt's tournament format which places the top two seeds in the conference's semifinals, Troy and Marshall will need to win just one game next weekend (March 8) to advance to the Sun Belt Tournament championship game.

    "body": "\n        The second day of on-field drills at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis featured defensive backs and tight ends at Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the Indianapolis Colts. Some prospects elevated their football reputations with eye-popping performances, while others forced front offices to revisit their college tape with a closer eye for detail.Here are some of the notable developments from Friday's on-field drills for the defensive back position, beginning with measurements, testing numbers and workout analysis for the prospects in CBS Sports' top 50 rankings, courtesy of NFL Draft analyst Mike Renner.Grading top DB prospects\n Measurables: 5-foot-11⅝, 206 pounds, 9½-inch hands, 30¼-inch arm length, 73¼-inch wingspanTesting: N/AGrade: N/A - Caleb Downs chose not to participate in on-field drills Friday. That won't hurt him, as CBS Sports' 2026 NFL Draft prospect rankings list Downs as the class's seventh-best overall player. Downs took home the 2025 Jim Thorpe Award, given annually to college football's top defensive back. He is also the only defensive back with 250-plus tackles (257), 15-plus tackles for loss (16) and five-plus interceptions (6) over the last three seasons -- the entirety of his college career. He also became the first true defensive back to finish in the top 10 of Heisman Trophy voting since LSU's Tyrann Mathieu in 2011. He can still be a top-10 pick with a strong pro day performance.\nMeasurables: 5-foot-10¾, 186 pounds, 8⅝-inch hands, 31-inch arm length, 75½-inch wingspanTesting: 34-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-3 broad jumpDespite not participating in the 40-yard dash, Avieon Terrell raised his stock Friday. He showcased fluid hips during on-field position drills and turned effortlessly toward the ball to secure it in another drill. Between his combine performance and collegiate production -- including setting Clemson's career forced-fumbles record for a defensive back with eight -- he helped himself in Indianapolis. Teams looking for a plug-and-play nickel corner should feel comfortable targeting Terrell.Mike Renner's combine grade: A-Renner's scouting take: Terrell had the cleanest on-field workout among the cornerbacks. His 6-foot-3 wingspan is excellent for his height. He only participated in jumps -- and the results were relatively average -- which is the only thing keeping him from earning a higher grade.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-0¾, 188 pounds, 9-inch hands, 31¼-inch arm length, 77-inch wingspanTesting: N/AGrade: N/A -- Jermod McCoy opted out of doing on-field drills on Friday after missing the entire 2025 season with a torn ACL. Excluding COVID-19 opt outs, the last first-round pick who did not play in college the previous year was edge rusher Robert Quinn in 2011 after being ruled academically ineligible. In 2024, McCoy earned first team All-SEC accolades after totaling four interceptions and nine passes defended.\nMeasurables: 5-foot-11¾, 187 pounds, 8⅞-inch hands, 30-inch arm length, 74½-inch wingspanTesting: N/AGrade: N/A -- Mansoor Delane opted out of on-field drills Friday. However, that won't sink his stock if he performs well at LSU's pro day this spring. Delane, a consensus 2025 All-American, led the SEC with a 24.1 passer rating allowed when targeted, the best mark in the conference among 82 players with at least 30 targets. He's a smooth mover who shows impressive fluidity when changing directions.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-3⅜, 201 pounds, 9¼-inch hands, 32⅛-inch arm length, 78¼-inch wingspanTesting: 4.52-second 40-yard dash, 1.58-second 10-yard split, 35.5-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-2 broad jumpEmmanuel McNeil-Warren profiles similarly to four-time second-team All-Pro safety Justin Simmons. At the 2016 combine, Simmons measured 6-foot-2⅜ and 202 pounds with 32⅝-inch arms. McNeil-Warren also showcased smoothness in on-field drills that could help him emerge as the draft's No. 2 safety prospect behind only Downs.Mike Renner's combine grade: B+Renner's scouting take: McNeil-Warren came in over an inch taller than his listed height. Athletically, he tested more than well enough but remains a clear tier behind many players in this class. He showed off impressive fluidity in on-field drills, which was extremely impressive for someone as tall as he is.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-0⅛, 201 pounds, 9-inch hands, 31⅜-inch arm length, 78⅛-inch wingspanTesting: 4.35-second 40-yard dash, 1.52-second 10-yard split, 41-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-5 broad jumpDillon Thieneman recorded the second-best vertical jump (41 inches) and the fourth-fastest 40-yard dash (4.35 seconds) among safeties Friday while also showcasing twitch and anticipation during position drills. He might possess the best anticipation of any safety in the 2026 class.Mike Renner's combine grade: A+Renner's scouting take: One of the most impressive combine performances you'll ever see from a safety. An elite athlete who looked more like a cornerback than a safety during on-field drills. He'll be a first-round pick.\nMeasurables: 5-foot-11⅝, 193 pounds, 9-inch hands, 31⅜-inch arm length, 74⅞-inch wingspanTesting: 4.44-second 40-yard dash, 1.58-second 10-yard split, 40.5-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-5 broad jump\"I think I'm the best corner in this class,\" Colton Hood said Thursday, via The Draft Network. He backed up that claim among the cornerbacks who completed all testing and on-field drills Friday. Hood's agility flashed in the backpedal and break drill, and he possesses an ideal build for an NFL cornerback, measuring nearly six feet tall with 4.4 speed at over 190 pounds.\nMike Renner's combine grade: BRenner's scouting take His 40 time was slower than anticipated, but the jumps were solid. A few other corners looked cleaner during on-field drills, and Hood didn't do enough to move closer to the top tier of corners in the class.\nOther standout performers\nMeasurables: 5-foot-8⅝, 182 pounds, 9⅝-inch hands, 29⅜-inch arm length, 72¼-inch wingspanTesting: 43.5-inch vertical jumpD'Angelo Ponds entered the combine with concerns about his ability to compete with bigger wideouts and play on the outside, but he eased some of those worries Friday with a 43.5-inch vertical jump. That leap ranked best among cornerbacks and fourth-best by a cornerback in combine history.\nPonds also tracked the deep ball well to haul in an interception during on-field position drills while showing off his agility in the line drill. That ability could translate to maintaining balance in coverage at the NFL level.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-3⅞, 194 pounds, 9¼-inch hands, 33⅜-inch arm length, 80⅞-inch wingspanTesting: 4.41-second 40-yard dash, 1.59-second 10-yard split, 37-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-3 broad jumpWashington's Tacario Davis is one of the biggest risers at the 2026 combine thanks to a unique blend of size and speed. Davis measured nearly 6-foot-4 and ran a 4.41-second 40-yard dash. He fits the prototypical cornerback mold former Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll used to build the \"Legion of Boom\" defense in the 2010s. The defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks deployed 6-foot-4 cornerback Tariq Woolen as part of their \"Dark Side\" defense, which ranked No. 1 in scoring defense (17.2 points allowed per game) in 2025.Davis was one of three cornerbacks to measure taller than 6-foot-3, joining Florida's Devin Moore and Washington's Ephesians Prysock. The Huskies' pro day will draw plenty of attention from Seattle evaluators eager for a closer look at Davis.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-0, 193 pounds, 9⅞-inch hands, 30⅝-inch arm length, wingspan not recordedTesting: 4.40-second 40-yard dash, 1.54-second 10-yard split, 38-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-6 broad jumpChris Johnson profiled as a strong man-coverage cornerback with solid instincts at San Diego State, as evidenced by his six career interceptions. He earned 2025 Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year honors with four interceptions, including an NCAA co-leading two interception-return touchdowns. He boosted his stock Friday by running a 4.40-second 40-yard dash before showcasing his explosiveness with a 38-inch vertical and a 10-foot-6 broad jump. Johnson could very well be a Day 2 pick.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-1, 190 pounds, 8½-inch hands, 31¾-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.33 40-yard dash, 1.50-second 10-yard split, 38-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-10 broad jumpArizona cornerback Treydan Stukes entered the week as CBS Sports' No. 71 overall prospect but climbed up draft boards after an electric combine performance Friday. The 2025 third-team All-American ran the third-fastest 40-yard dash among safeties at 4.33 seconds and ranked in the top five at the position in both the vertical jump (38 inches, tied for fifth) and broad jump (10-foot-10, tied for first). Stukes has solidified himself as a Day 2 pick and will garner plenty of interest at Arizona's pro day.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-0½, 194 pounds, 9½-inch hands, 31⅝-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.27-second 40-yard dash, 1.49-second 10-yard split, 39-inch vertical jumpOhio State safety Lorenzo Styles Jr. entered the week as CBS Sports' No. 216 overall prospect but he's sure to climb up the rankings after a historic combine outing Friday. The two-time Academic All-Big Ten selection posted the fastest 40-yard dash by a safety since NFL Network began tracking combine data in 2003, running a 4.27. He joined his brother Sonny in turning heads at the 2026 combine. Styles' 39-inch vertical ranked fourth among safeties this year.Even more impressive, he is scheduled to undergo labrum surgery next week after playing through the injury during the season, according to The Athletic.\nMeasurables: 6-foot-0, 188 pounds, 9-inch hands, 31½-inch arm lengthTesting: 4.41-second 40-yard dash, 1.56-second 10-yard split, 38-inch vertical jump, 10-foot-7 broad jumpTCU safety Bud Clark entered the combine with strong ball production: his 15 career interceptions are tied for the most in college football this decade and tied for the second-most in Big 12 history (since 1976). He paired that production with a strong testing performance. Clark tied for the sixth-fastest 40-yard dash among safeties at 4.41 seconds while finishing tied for fifth in both the vertical jump (38 inches) and broad jump (10-foot-7).Clark entered the week as CBS Sports' No. 179 overall prospect and No. 10 safety but has emerged as one of the biggest defensive back risers in Indianapolis this week.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        INDIANAPOLIS -- It's Friday of NFL combine week, which means prospect measurements and on-field workouts are officially in full swing. The schedule is as follows:Friday: TE and DBSaturday: QB, RB and WRSunday: OLIn the morning, players log official measurements, including height, weight, wingspan, arm length and hand size. In the afternoon, they participate in on-field testing -- including the 40-yard dash, vertical and broad jumps, and bench press -- before wrapping up with positional drills inside Lucas Oil Stadium.The festivities kicked off Thursday with defensive linemen, edge rushers and linebackers. Much of the day's discussion centered on Rueben Bain Jr.'s historically short arms, but once workouts began, attention shifted to the top prospects not named Bain, who elected not to work out. (Other top prospects to sit out included Peter Woods, Akheem Mesidor and CJ Allen.)Ohio State EDGE Arvell Reese -- the No. 3 prospect in CBS Sports draft analyst Mike Renner's rankings -- performed like a bona fide top-five pick, as did Ohio State LB Sonny Styles (No. 10) and Texas Tech EDGE David Bailey (No. 19).\nNow attention turns to defensive backs and tight ends on Friday. While Tennessee's Jermod McCoy and LSU's Mansoor Delane -- two of Renner's top three cornerbacks in this class -- will not participate, expect other first-round talents like Ohio State's Caleb Downs (No. 7), Clemson's Avieon Terrell (No. 11) and Oregon's Kenyon Sadiq (No. 29) to showcase their unique skill sets.As combine week rolls along, we've got you covered with every official measurement and testing number as they come in from Indianapolis.CB measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanJermod McCoyTennessee6-0 ¾188931 ¼77Avieon TerrellClemson5-10 ¾1868 ⅝3175 ½Mansoor DelaneLSU5-11 ¾1878 ⅞3074 ½Colton HoodTennessee5-11 ⅝193931 ⅜74 ⅞Keith AbneyArizona State5-101879 ⅝30--Chris JohnsonSan Diego State6-01939 ⅞30 ⅝--D'Angelo PondsIndiana5-8 ⅝1829 ⅝29 ⅜72 ¼Keionte ScottMiami (FL)5-11 ¼1939 ⅝31 ⅜76 ⅝Brandon CisseSouth Carolina5-11 ¾1898 ⅝30 ⅝75 ⅞Devin MooreFlorida6-3 ¼1988 ⅝31 ⅝76 ⅞Julian NealArkansas6-22039 ¾32 ⅝--Will Lee IIITexas A&M6-1 ½189932 ⅝--Malik MuhammadTexas6-01829 ⅞32 ⅜--Davison IgbinosunOhio State6-21899 ⅛32 ⅞--Daylen EveretteGeorgia6-11969 ⅝31 ⅞--Chandler RiversDuke5-9 ½1859 ¾29 ⅜--Hezekiah MassesCalifornia6-11798 ¼31 ⅛--TJ HallIowa6-11899 ½30--Domani JacksonAlabama6-11949 ⅛31 ⅛--Tacario DavisWashington6-3 ⅞1949 ¼33 ⅜80 ⅞Thaddeus DixonNorth Carolina6-11951031 ⅛--Ephesians PrysockWashington6-3 ⅜1969 ⅝33 ⅛80 ½Charles DemmingsStephen F.

His play on the field has been fantastic, and that will ultimately determine where teams take him in April. Antoine Winfield Jr. (a second-round pick in 2020) is one player with similar measurements who has gone on to find success. \nPonds also has an acceptable wingspan of 72 ¼ inches, which, as Mike Renner notes, is longer than DT Byron Murphy II, CB Donte Jackson and CB Roger McCreary, and nearly identical to CB Trent McDuffie. None of those players were drafted later than No. 55 overall.CB testing numbersPlayer40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Jermod McCoy---------------Avieon Terrell----3410-3------Mansoor Delane--------------Colton Hood4.441.5840.510-5------Keith Abney--------------Chris Johnson4.401.543810-6------D'Angelo Ponds----43.5--------Keionte Scott--------------Brandon Cisse----4110-11------Devin Moore4.501.56----------Julian Neal4.491.594011-27.134.20--Will Lee III4.521.564211-0------Malik Muhammad4.421.5139--------Davison Igbinosun4.451.583410-0------Daylen Everette4.381.5437.510-4------Chandler Rivers4.401.553910-10------Hezekiah Masses4.461.5731.59-11------TJ Hall4.591.6236--7.194.19--Domani Jackson4.411.58----------Tacario Davis4.411.593710-3------Thaddeus Dixon----39.510-5------Ephesians Prysock4.451.573910-4------Charles Demmings4.411.554211-0------Jaylon Guilbeau--------------Andre Fuller4.491.563510-9--4.28--Jadon Canady--------------Collin Wright----39--------Toriano Pride Jr.4.321.5137.510-87.20----Ahmari Harvey--------------Latrell McCutchin4.431.5838.510-117.004.18--Avery Smith4.541.6138.510-57.034.46--Marcus Allen4.501.643910-3------SAF measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanCaleb DownsOhio State5-11 ⅝2069 ½30 ¼73 ¼Emmanuel McNeil-WarrenToledo6-3 ½2019 ¼32 ⅛78 ¼Dillon ThienemanOregon6-0 ⅛201931 ⅜78 ⅛Genesis SmithArizona6-2 ⅛2028 ⅞32 ½79 ¼A.J.

His 77⅜-inch wingspan isn't ideal, either; only 19 edge rushers in the MockDraftable database (since 1999) have measured shorter. Bain will still be a first-round pick -- likely in the top 10 — but teams with strict length thresholds could be wary of those numbers.\nCashius Howell, Mike Renner's No. 24 prospect in this class, has even shorter arms than Bain at 30¼ inches -- the shortest of any edge rusher since 1999, per MockDraftable. However, the reigning SEC Defensive Player of the Year doesn't believe his historically short arms will prevent him from being productive in the NFL. \"Those are just the cards that I've been dealt,\" Howell said during Wednesday's podium session. \"I'm going to do everything in my power to perfect my technique and perfect my craft in whatever way possible.\"\n        \n            \n                Can star Miami edge rusher Rueben Bain Jr. overcome physical limitations?\n                \n                    Jared Dubin                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nEDGE testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Rueben Bain Jr.Miami (FL)------------Arvell ReeseOhio State4.461.58--------David BaileyTexas Tech4.501.623510-9----Cashius HowellTexas A&M4.591.5832.59-7----Akheem MesidorMiami (FL)------------R Mason ThomasOklahoma4.671.63--------T.J.

He reminded everyone of his NFL potential with a strong showing at the Senior Bowl, then followed that up with impressive combine measurables, including an 85¾-inch wingspan — the longest among combine defensive tackles since 1999. He also posted 98th percentile height (6-foot-6 ¼), 89th percentile weight (327 pounds), 94th percentile hand size (10⅞ inches) and 94th percentile arm length (35 inches). Banks has a good chance to go in the back half of Round 1.\nClemson's Peter Woods entered the 2025 season as a potential top-five pick, but an inconsistent fall -- despite earning first-team All-ACC honors -- pushed him out of that conversation. While Woods remains a first-round talent, some of his measurables disappointed, including fourth-percentile arm length (31¼ inches) and 10th-percentile wingspan (76⅜ inches). Woods also did not participate in on-field drills at the combine. He'll look to show off his skill set at Clemson's pro day on March 12.\nDL testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Peter WoodsClemson--------------Lee HunterTexas Tech5.181.7921.58-4------Kayden McDonaldOhio State--------------Keldric FaulkAuburn359-9------Christen MillerGeorgia--------------Caleb BanksFlorida5.051.76329-6------Jaishawn BarhamMichigan4.641.613310-3------Chris McClellanMissouri5.051.8029.59-0----25Rayshaun BennyMichigan--------------Domonique OrangeIowa State--------------Dontay CorleoneCincinnati--------------Nick BarrettSouth Carolina5.101.7031.59-08.174.91--Darrell Jackson Jr.Florida State--------------LT OvertonAlabama4.871.70----------Kaleb ProctorSE Louisiana4.791.69339-5--4.71--Tim KeenanAlabama5.311.84308-4----21Zxavian HarrisOle Miss--------------Skyler Gill-HowardTexas Tech------------27Gracen HaltonOklahoma4.821.7036.59-68.094.79--DeMonte CapehartClemson4.851.7233.58-11------Albert RegisTexas A&M4.881.72349-87.774.85--Tyler OnyedimTexas A&M----329-3------Bryson EasonTennessee5.091.7830.59-4--5.00--Brandon ClevelandNC State5.121.78----------David GustaKentucky4.881.6832------37Zane DurantPenn State4.751.6633.59-4------Damonic WilliamsOklahoma------------30Gary Smith IIIUCLA----28--------Cameron BallArkansas5.131.79329-18.024.76--Bobby Jamison-TravisAuburn--------------Deven EasternMinnesota----27.59-48.07----Jackie MarshallBaylor4.881.69------4.68--\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top DL/EDGE prospects, plus other standouts from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Josh Edwards                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nLB measurementsPlayerSchoolHeightWeightHandArmWingspanSonny StylesOhio State6-52441032⅞80⅞Anthony HillTexas6-22389⅝32⅜79Jake GoldayCincinnati6-4 ½2399½31⅞76⅞Josiah TrotterMissouri6-223710¼32¼--CJ AllenGeorgia6-0 ¾23010⅛31½75½Kyle LouisPittsburgh6-02209½31¼--Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech6-12319¼30⅞--Lander BartonUtah6-52339½32¼--Harold Perkins Jr.LSU6-12238⅛31⅜--Red MurdockBuffalo6-223210⅜31--Keyshaun ElliottArizona State6-22319¼31¼--Deontae LawsonAlabama6-32269¼31⅞--Bryce BoettcherOregon6-1233930⅝--Taurean YorkTexas A&M5-112268⅜30--Jimmy RolderMichigan6-2 ½2389⅝30½--Aiden FisherIndiana6-12329½31⅛--Wade WoodazClemson6-32361032⅝--Jack KellyBYU6-22409⅛31⅛--Kaleb Elarms-OrrTCU6-2234931½--Scooby WilliamsTexas A&M6-22319¼32--Justin JeffersonAlabama6-02231031⅝--Xavian SoreyArkansas6-22289⅝31⅝--Namdi ObiazorTCU6-322910½30⅝--Owen HeineckeOklahoma6-1 ½2279⅝30⅛--Kendal DanielsOklahoma6-52429½32⅝--Eric GentryUSC6-722110½35--Karson ShararIowa6-1 ⅝23110⅛31⅛--Wesley BissaintheMiami6-22259⅝31⅞--LB testing numbersNameSchool40-yard dash10-yard splitVertical (in)Broad (ft-in)3-coneShuttleBench (reps)Sonny StylesOhio State4.461.5643.511-27.094.26--Anthony HillTexas4.511.583710-5----21Jake GoldayCincinnati4.621.603910-57.024.34--Josiah TrotterMissouri------------27CJ AllenGeorgia--------------Kyle LouisPittsburgh4.531.5839.510-96.974.26--Jacob RodriguezTexas Tech4.571.6038.510-16.904.19--Lander BartonUtah--------------Harold Perkins Jr.LSU--------------Red MurdockBuffalo--------------Keyshaun ElliottArizona State----3810-5----21Deontae LawsonAlabama--------------Bryce BoettcherOregon--------------Taurean YorkTexas A&M--------7.324.4825Jimmy RolderMichigan----369-117.004.26--Aiden FisherIndiana--------------Wade WoodazClemson--------------Jack KellyBYU4.571.613710-57.124.19--Kaleb Elarms-OrrTCU4.471.594010-4--4.41--Scooby WilliamsTexas A&M--------------Justin JeffersonAlabama4.571.6038.510-5------Xavian SoreyArkansas4.631.6637.5107.004.42--Namdi ObiazorTCU4.531.56379-117.244.36--Owen HeineckeOklahoma4.621.6234.59-117.15----Kendal DanielsOklahoma--------------Eric GentryUSC--------------Karson ShararIowa4.561.594010-3------Wesley BissaintheMiami--------------\n        \n            \n                NFL combine 2026: Grades for top LB prospects, plus other standouts from on-field workouts\n                \n                    Garrett Podell                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nSaturday: QB, RB and WR measurements and testing numbersResults will be added here as testing begins.Sunday: OL measurements and testing numbersResults will be added here as testing begins.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Oklahoma City Thunder picked up a gritty 127-121 overtime win over the Denver Nuggets on Friday night, but the topic of conversation after the game was not Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's tremendous play in his first game back or Oklahoma City winning overtime with Gilgeous-Alexander on the bench after playing 34 minutes in regulation. Instead, it was about Lu Dort purposefully tripping Nikola Jokić in the fourth quarter as he ran back up the floor and the ensuing kerfuffle that had Jokić as angry as anyone's ever seen him on the court. \nDort was assessed a flagrant 2 foul and ejected, while Jokić and Jaylin Williams were each given technicals for their altercation afterwards. Officials deemed Dort's trip \"unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury,\" which is why it was elevated to a flagrant 2 upon review. The backboard camera angle clearly shows Dort's intent to trip Jokić. When asked about it after the game, Jokić's feelings on the incident hadn't changed, and he felt his response and fury were a \"necessary reaction\" to being tripped. \n\"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor,\" Jokić said. \"So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault's reaction to the ejection was simply to expect this ruling to become precedent for any future tripping incidents involving any players, not just high-profile stars. \"I will say this: If [Jaylin Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\nWhen pressed on whether he felt it was only ruled a flagrant 2 because it was Jokić who was tripped, Daigneault felt he'd made his point. \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that,\" Daigneault said. \"I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n        \n            \n                NBA Concern Meter: Who has most to worry about as the 2026 playoffs loom?\n                \n                    John Gonzalez                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIt wasn't the first incident involving Jokić in the game, as he and Gilgeous-Alexander got tangled up in the first quarter and Gilgeous-Alexander was given a technical foul for throwing the ball at Jokić. Because tensions were already high and there had been multiple smaller incidents during the game, the referees were trying to take control and keep things from spiralling. That, coupled with Dort's history, resulted in the flagrant 2 being assessed in part because of the act and in part to try to keep the game from having any more dust-ups. \nIn that way, the ruling was successful as the two teams played the final 13 minutes of the fourth quarter and overtime without any more scuffles. And while Daigneault was unhappy with the flagrant 2 decision, the Thunder were able to rally in large part due to Dort's replacement, Alex Caruso, who buried two critical three-pointers late in regulation that helped OKC send the game to overtime. In OT, the Thunder left Gilgeous-Alexander on the bench after playing 34 minutes (and scoring 36 points) in his first game back from injury, and the Thunder's depth was on display with Cason Wallace, Caruso and Isaiah Joe leading the way offensively. That finish ended up as the secondary storyline to the Jokić-Dort kerfuffle, but it's all laying the foundation for a potentially incredible playoff series if these two meet again in May or June. The teams met in last year's Western Conference semifinals, a heated series the Thunder took in seven games.\n            ",

    "body": "\nThe Southeastern Conference and Big 12 will be strongly represented when the NCAA Tournament field and seedings are announced in 15 days. And with just a handful games left before conference tournaments tip off, the top teams are looking to get dialed in.The penultimate Saturday of the men's college basketball regular season features five games pitting top-25 teams against each other, including two each from the SEC and Big 12. The other features No. 1 Duke hosting 11th-ranked Virginia at noon ET in an Atlantic Coast Conference matchup as the Cavaliers aim to take down the projected No. 1 overall seed for the tournament.In the SEC, defending national champion Florida sits at No. 7 and hosts John Calipari's No. 20-ranked Arkansas Razorbacks, who have won five of their past six -- losing in double overtime to Alabama. The other conference battle is a rematch as No. 17 Alabama visits No. 22 Tennessee. The Vols beat the Crimson Tide 79-73 on Jan. 24 but have lost two games since, while Bama has won seven in a row and has only lost to Florida since the last meeting.        Three of the nation's top five teams are from the Big 12, and all three will be in action Saturday. No. 5 Houston should have it fairly easy against Colorado at noon ET, but No. 2 Arizona and No. 4 Iowa State will face stiffer tests. The Wildcats are set to host No. 14 Kansas, a rematch of the 82-78 loss that helped cost Arizona the top ranking a couple of weeks ago. Iowa State, which has lost twice in its past five games and faces Arizona on Monday, hosts No. 16 Texas Tech.                   In addition to the loaded college basketball slate, there are five NBA matchups, headlined by Lakers vs. Warriors, and 13 games in the NHL. Two key Eastern Conference NHL matchups are on tap, with Sabres vs. Lightning and Red Wings vs. Hurricanes both set for 7 p.m. ET. Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on at the top sportsbooks on Saturday, Feb. 28. All times Eastern. College basketball best bets today, where to watchNo. 14 Kansas at No. 2 ArizonaTime: 4 p.m. ET | Location: Tucson, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Arizona -9.5\nIt's been a topsy-turvy few weeks for the Kansas Jayhawks (21-7, 11-4 in Big 12), starting with their huge home victory against the No. 1 Wildcats on Feb. 9. Arizona (26-2, 13-2) would lose again five days later, 78-75 to Texas Tech in overtime. But the Wildcats have bounced back with three consecutive victories, including against ranked BYU and Houston teams. KU has lost two of four games since beating Arizona -- to Iowa State and Cincinnati -- but come in off a 69-56 home victory against No. 5 Houston. The Jayhawks are 5-4 in road games this season, while Arizona has won 14 of 15 games on its home floor, with the setback being that tight loss to Texas Tech. The Wildcats are 9.5-point favorites in the Kansas vs. Arizona odds, and the SportsLine Projection Model thinks the Wildcats will have an easier time at home, as the model has them winning by 10 and covering the spread in 50% of simulations.   No. 16 Texas Tech at No. 4 Iowa StateTime: 4 p.m. ET | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: CBS | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Over 146.5\nAll four of the Cyclones' losses have come on the road, and the Red Raiders are 4-4 away from home, so playing in Ames should be a big edge for Iowa State. The hosts have losses against Cincinnati and TCU but have beaten Kansas and Houston this month and knocked off then-No. 1 Purdue back in December. In addition to taking down then-top-ranked Arizona two weeks ago, Texas Tech has beaten Kansas, Houston and BYU. Five of the Red Raiders' seven losses have come against ranked teams. Iowa State outscores opponents by an average of almost 18 points and is seventh in KenPom's defensive efficiency rating, but the Red Raiders are 11th in offensive rating. The Cyclones are 10.5-point favorites at home, and the SportsLine model likes the Over, giving it a \"B\" grade with its projected total coming in above 155 points.     No. 20 Arkansas at No. 7 FloridaTime: 8:30 p.m. ET | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine picks -- Model: Under 168.5 | Expert: Over 168.5 (Chip Patterson) \nThe Gators (22-6, 13-2 in SEC) seem to be peaking at the right time, with the only blemish on their record over the past 14 games being a loss to Auburn on Jan. 24. They have five victories against ranked teams over that span. Arkansas (21-7, 11-4) has won eight of its past 10, with a double-overtime loss at Alabama and the other setback at home against Kentucky. Freshman Darius Acuff Jr. has been a force for the Razorbacks, averaging 22.2 points and 6.2 assists, both top 20 in the nation. The Gators have six players who score in double figures, and Rueben Chinyelu (11.3 points, 11.5 rebounds) has been dominant inside. The Gators are 10.5-point home favorites, but the SportsLine model has the Razorbacks covering the sizable spread in 50% of its simulations. Its best play is on the Under, which hits 62% of the time. Patterson disagrees, as he expects Acuff to have a big impact and Florida's rebounders to create extra chances for the Gators.  NBA best bets today, where to watchLos Angeles Lakers at Golden State WarriorsTime: 8:30 p.m. ET | Location: San Francisco | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Warriors ML\nThe Lakers and Warriors are off to rocky starts coming off the All-Star Break, but uneven play is nothing new for the teams this season. Los Angeles (34-24) is sixth in the Western Conference but leads the Pacific Division, while the injury-ravaged Warriors (31-28) are eighth in the West and 3.5 games behind L.A. in the division. The Lakers have lost three of four since the break, losing 113-110 at Phoenix on a last-second 3-pointer Thursday despite getting 41 points from Luka Doncic. Golden State routed the Grizzlies 133-112 on Wednesday as eight players scored in double figures with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green among the Warriors who sat out. Curry will be out again, but Green could be back, and while the Lakers are 4.5-point favorites, the SportsLine Model gives an \"A\" grade to Golden State +156 on the money line, as it wins in 58% of simulations. Over 229.5 also gets an \"A,\" hitting almost 62% of the time.   NHL best bets today, where to watchDetroit Red Wings at Carolina HurricanesTime: 7 p.m. ET | Location: Raleigh, N.C. | TV: ESPN+ | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Hurricanes ML\nThe Carolina Hurricanes stormed into Tampa on Thursday night and came out with a 5-4 victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning. They have lost just two of their past 11 games -- one in overtime and the other in a shootout -- and are battling Tampa Bay for the best record in the Eastern Conference. Now they face a Red Wings team that sits second in the Atlantic Division behind Tampa Bay but has lost five of its past eight games. Detroit did come out of the Olympics break with a victory, beating the Ottawa Senators 2-1 in overtime on Thursday. The Red Wings and Hurricanes have met twice this season, with the home team winning each time. The December matchup in Raleigh was a 5-2 demolition of Detroit, and Carolina is a -187 money-line favorite in the Red Wings vs. Hurricanes odds. The SportsLine model has the Hurricanes winning 69% of the time.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The Road to WrestleMania has reached its final prelude. WWE has just one PPV left before the greatest show of them all in April and that's the Elimination Chamber. WWE returns to Chicago on Saturday night for the epic event where two superstars will punch their ticket to WrestleMania 42 by outlasting five others inside the sadistic structure. The men's match has some massive names looking to return to a headlining role at WrestleMania (Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton) but it also has some men looking to make their mark and earn their first headlining spot (LA Knight, Je'Von Evans and Trick Williams).The men's match got a late swerve on the final SmackDown before the event. Jey Uso, who earned a spot in the match with a win on Monday over Bronson Reed and El Grande Americano, was taken out backstage by an unknown assailant. That led SmackDown general manager Nick Aldis to book an impromptu match between Jacob Fatu and Logan Paul for the final spot in the Chamber, which Paul won with some outside assistance.\nOn the women's side, four former champions are set to compete in Tiffany Stratton, Rhea Ripley, Alexa Bliss and Asuka while two newer competitors look to make a splash in Kiana James and Raquel Rodriguez.The other two matches are near and dear to the fans in Chicago. World heavyweight champion CM Punk puts his title on the line in front of his hometown fans when he takes on Finn Balor. And Punk's wife, AJ Lee, challenges Becky Lynch for the women's intercontinental title in her first singles match in more than a decade.Take a look below at the confirmed matches for Elimination Chamber. The event streams live on ESPN Unlimited on Saturday with the main card starting at 6 p.m. ET. Be sure to check out our predictions for each match as well. \n2026 WWE Elimination Chamber matchesWorld Heavyweight Championship -- CM Punk (c) vs. Finn Balor: Balor returned to the main event scene after Judgment Day ally Liv Morgan accused him of complacency. Balor fell short of defeating the world heavyweight champion in Balor's home nation of Ireland. The respect Punk and Balor showed each other after the match fizzled out after Balor was denied a rematch by Raw general manager Adam Pearce. Balor took matters into his own hands, attacking Punk and provoking the champ into granting him a rematch.Elimination Chamber match -- Randy Orton vs. LA Knight vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Je'Von Evans vs. Trick Williams vs. Logan Paul: An undisputed WWE title shot awaits the winner of the men's Elimination Chamber match. Orton qualified by beating Aleister Black and Solo Sikoa in a triple threat match. Knight defeated Austin Theory and Penta to earn his spot. After Rhodes earned his spot with a win over Jacob Fatu and Sami Zayn, Evans became the biggest surprise entrant in the match by defeating Gunther and Dominik Mysterio on Raw. Williams earned the penultimate spot by beating Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest. Jey Uso initially earned the final spot in the match, but he was taken out on SmackDown, leading to a match between Fatu and Logan Paul, which Paul won thanks to some additional help.Women's Intercontinental Championship -- Becky Lynch (c) vs. AJ Lee: Punk isn't the only adored superstar coming home to Chicago. Lee seeks to join her husband as an active champion at Elimination Chamber. Lynch proposed the match, but only agreed to defend her women's intercontinental title after Lee refused to wrestle her otherwise. Lee is 2-0 against Lynch since ending her 10-year retirement, beating her in a mixed tag team match and in WarGames.\nElimination Chamber match -- Rhea Ripley vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Alexa Bliss vs. Asuka vs. Kiana James vs. Raquel Rodriguez: Stratton advanced to the Elimination Chamber by beating Lash Legend and Chelsea Green on SmackDown. Ripley qualified by overcoming Lyra Valkyria and Ivy Nile on Raw. Bliss defeated Giulia and Zelina Vega to grab a spot in the match, and was joined by Asuka, who defeated Bayley and Nattie. James snuck a pinfall over Charlotte Flair in their match with Nia Jax. Rodriguez has the chance to join Judgment Day Liv Morgan in challenging for a world championship at WrestleMania after defeating Iyo Sky and Kairi Sane in the final qualifier.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Yankees hulking designated hitter Giancarlo Stanton has dealt with plenty of injuries in his career. He didn't make his season debut in 2025 until June 16 due to dealing with tennis elbow -- in both elbows. And yet Stanton, who turned 36 over the offseason, is looking to avoid the injured list in 2026. He seems to have accepted that he'll be in pain and can't do things many of us take for granted as normal, so long as he can keep taking swings. Asked if his elbow injuries have healed, Stanton told NJ.com \"that'll never be the case.\"Never?\"Not while I'm in this line of work,\" he said. \"You have your good days and bad days, just like your mood and everything.\"---\"I can't open a bottle,\" Stanton said. \"I can't open a bag of chips … a bag of anything. That's the way it is.\"Despite that, Stanton says he's still eyeing a full season. He and the Yankees are slow-playing things this spring, as he hasn't yet seen game action (he's expected to start his first game on March 3) but is getting in his work in the batting cages. During the regular season, the expectation is that he'll get regular playing time and also rest on occasion. \"No doubt, no doubt,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone told NJ.com. \"We did that last year. There were days he was playing where it was tough for him, but he wanted in there. There are other days he wanted to be in there and I'd say, 'We have to stay disciplined to this because you're so critical to us.'\"Stanton played in just 77 games last season, but he's still capable of being a one-man wrecking crew. He hit .273/.350/.594, good for a huge 158 OPS+ and clubbed 24 homers with 66 RBI -- again, that's in less than half a season. In the last five seasons with the Yankees, Stanton has averaged 28.2 home runs and 108 games per season. The hope he and the Yankees have this season is he'll play a lot more than 108 games. If he does, we might well see 40 homers. The active leader in career homers, Stanton has 453 to his credit. He's signed through 2027 with a club option for 2028. Lovers of baseball history will note that it looks like there's a good chance Stanton gets to 500 career home runs. For the Yankees and Stanton, they'll just look to see him in the lineup this season for something like 135 games. \nWhen Stanton is in there, the Yankees have one of the more powerful lineups in the league. Trent Grisham hit 34 home runs last season and Jazz Chisholm had 31. Ben Rice hit 26 in only 467 at-bats, Cody Bellinger had 29 and then there are Judge and Stanton. That's six prolific power hitters before you even get to a catcher who hit 21 last season in Austin Wells.The Yankees went 94-68 last season, tying them for the best American League record, but they lost a tiebreaker to the Blue Jays and had to settle for a wild card. They were knocked out of the playoffs by the Jays in the ALDS.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        LAWRENCE, Kansas -- When Big 12 schedule-makers unveiled the slate in September, Kelvin Sampson's eyes gravitated toward the trial by fire that Houston just exited: Feb. 16 at No. 4 Iowa State, Feb. 21 vs. No. 2 Arizona and Feb. 23 at No. 14 Kansas.\"Spurs on Monday, Oklahoma City on Saturday, turn around and play Marcus Sasser's [Detroit] Pistons,\" Sampson says with a twinkle in his eye to perhaps hide the frustration in his soul. Houston had Iowa State dead to rights in the second half before the Cyclones' role players like Nate Heise and Jamarion Batemon hit some gigantic treys to rally Iowa State to a 70-67 victory. Five days later, Houston had Arizona right in its crosshairs before petering out down the stretch to one of the National Championship frontrunners. Some 48 hours after that, Houston had to walk into Allen Fieldhouse to play Kansas. The Jayhawks, fresh off a frustrating home loss to Cincinnati, used an 11-0 burst at the end of the first half and a 16-3 surge early in the second half to run away with a 69-56 win.Houston got Hilton Magic'd, Zona'd and Big Monday'd in a week-long stretch. For the first time since 2017, Houston has lost three games in a row, and yet, Sampson walked into Monday's postgame press conference itching to preach positivity.\n\"We're not gonna go jump off with the bridge 'cause we lost this game,\" Sampson says. \"I knew what we were walking into, but I was really, really proud of our guys.\"Maybe that's a public front -- Sampson is never cool with Ls -- but there's some truth laced into the sermon. There is such a thing as schedule losses in hoops, and catching an irritated Kansas on Big Monday (a spot that Bill Self entered a mind-boggling 40-0) looks like a schedule loss if there ever was one.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology: Florida, Virginia moving up while Auburn, Indiana slide in NCAA Tournament projection\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nHouston's starting backcourt of Milos Uzan, Emanuel Sharp and Kingston Flemings combined for 28 points on 35 shots, by far the worst performance of the season for the best trio of guards that you can find in college basketball. Sampson did note that Sharp was nicked up after a bad fall against Arizona, and Uzan is fighting an ankle injury.\n\"I took Milos and Emanuel out for a reason; they had nothing, they were dead,\" Sampson said. \"Sharp guarded his butt off. I think he played 35 minutes on Saturday. Milos played 38 minutes [against Arizona]. That was why I took them all out with eight minutes to go. They just had no legs. But that's the schedule we had to play.\"The three-game slide all but knocks Houston out of the Big 12 Championship chase. The Cougars trail Arizona by two games in the loss column with three to play. The Cougars have a 0.1% chance of earning the No. 1 seed in the Big 12 Tournament, per CBB Analytics.But is it time for panic about Houston's hopes in March? As usual, it's complicated. \nPotential hot spots emergingJust 27% of Houston's offensive shots come at the rim. This Cougars team is more jump-shot reliant than any other high-major team in college basketball, so when you play a third game in eight days, and the legs are gone, nights like Monday can emerge.Seventeen of Houston's 66 (26%) shots against Kansas came at the rim. The Cougars took 39 jumpers and shot just 23% on 'em, the second-worst showing this year according to Synergy.Sampson pointed to dead legs, and the eye test and data unequivocally back up those claims. Houston missed short on a ton of jumpers.\nYou can win with a jump-shot heavy diet like this when you offensive rebound at a very high level. Houston preaches offensive rebounding as well as anybody in the country, and big man JoJo Tugler owns the No. 1 offensive rebounding rate in Big 12 play. Tugler is the reigning Defensive Player of the Year. He's revered for his defense, but his consistent first-half foul trouble is hurting Houston's offense in a real way. The Cougars need his offensive rebounding in the worst way, serving as a \"get out of jail free\" card when jumpers are coming up short.Tugler sat out the final 10 minutes of the first half with two fouls. At that point, Houston had five offensive rebounds. For the final 10 minutes, Houston corralled just one offensive rebound.Houston's offensive rebounding percentage when Tugler is on the floor, per hoop-explorer: 23.6% (No. 3 in America)Houston's offensive rebounding percentage when Tugler is off the floor, per hoop-explorer: 18.8% (No. 83 in America)\"JoJo is a lot like those old gunslingers like Daryle Lamonica, Kenny Stabler, Jim Plunkett, Sonny Jurgensen, Billy Kilmer or Johnny Unitas,\" Sampson says. \"Dudes got two little bars in front of their face. They go play and throw three or four interceptions and six or seven touchdowns. But if you try to take away their interceptions and make them be more pinpoint or not nearly as aggressive, they're probably not gonna throw touchdown passes, either. It's probably a bad analogy. But it's hard to get JoJo to not play aggressive. A lot of his fouls are probably unnecessary. Believe it or not, since this freshman year, he's gotten a lot better.\"\nSampson is right. Tugler is \"only\" averaging 5.5 fouls per 40 minutes this season. That's the best mark of his career. But the constant foul trouble for Houston's best defender and best offensive rebounder has become a burr in Sampson's saddle.\"We're a much, much better team, and he's on the floor,\" Sampson said. \"When you go back and look at the game when we beat Duke [in the 2025 Final Four], he was the best friend on the floor last five minutes. He's really important to us.\"The shot diet for Houston is not changing, largely because of the personnel. Houston does not have a backdown threat who can hunt mismatches in the mid-post area. The Cougars have been one of the worst post-up offenses in college basketball this season, so Sampson has largely ditched it from Houston's offensive arsenal.\nThis team is going to take a ton of jumpers from here on out. A jumper from Sharp, Uzan or Flemings is a better shot than a Tugler post-up at this point, but it makes the offensive rebounding and Tugler's availability even that much more vital down the home stretch.Reason for optimismThere are three pretty simple reasons to be bullish on Houston in March:Sampson is the coach.This backcourt is unbelievable.Houston plays ridiculously hard.Enough said.\"I think these three games, even though we're disappointed, we lost them, it's not the end of the world,\" Sampson said. \"I don't know if anybody had to play three straight games like this. We just ran out of steam.\"\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The last time Matt Ryan and Kyle Pitts were on the same team it was 2021, and Pitts had a historic season. Hopefully, history will repeat itself in 2026 now that the Falcons have placed the franchise tag on Pitts.In 2021, when Pitts was a rookie, Ryan was his quarterback. Pitts looked like a star with 68 catches for 1,026 yards and one touchdown on 110 targets, and he averaged 10.4 PPR points per game. He became just the second rookie tight end with over 1,000 receiving yards, joining Mike Ditka, who accomplished the feat in 1961 with 1,076 yards. Brock Bowers joined their exclusive club in 2024 with 1,194 yards.Fast forward to 2026, and Ryan is now the president of the Falcons. He was part of the decision to keep Pitts in Atlanta, and this is a great move for Pitts' Fantasy value.With Kevin Stefanski the new head coach of the Falcons, it could be another standout season for Pitts, who was great in 2025. He had 88 catches for 928 yards and five touchdowns on 118 targets, and he averaged 12.4 PPR points per game. He was the No. 5 tight end for the season.\nBut before we look at Stefanski's history of using tight ends during his time in Cleveland (2020-25), let's look at what Pitts has done in his career. And, as Fantasy managers, we know he's been more potential than production during his five-year tenure.Following his rookie campaign, Pitts struggled with a knee injury in 2022 and averaged just 7.6 PPR points in 10 games. He had another down season in 2023 at 8.1 PPR points per game, and he was at 7.7 PPR points per game in 2024.Most Fantasy managers gave up on Pitts in 2025, and he was the No. 17 tight end selected based on the CBS Sports Average Draft Position at 143.3. But for anyone who drafted him, it was a nice reward.\nHe scored at least 12.9 PPR points in four of his first seven games. And in the second half of the season, Pitts was heroic at times, especially in the Fantasy playoffs when he had four games in a row with at least 15 PPR points from Weeks 13-16. Included in that stretch was his outstanding performance at Tampa Bay in Week 15 with 11 catches for 166 yards and three touchdowns on 12 targets. He scored 45.6 PPR points, which is considered the fifth-best tight end outing of all-time, trailing only Kellen Winslow (57.4 PPR points in 1981), Winslow again (48.2 PPR points in 1983), Shannon Sharpe (46.3 PPR points in 1996) and Ditka (46 PPR points in 1961).Now, part of the reason for Pitts' success down the stretch was Drake London missing Weeks 12-15 with a knee injury. London also missed Week 8 against Miami, and in five games without London, Pitts averaged 19.1 PPR points over that span. In 12 games with London, Pitts averaged just 9.6 PPR points.\nWe also have to see what Atlanta does at quarterback in 2026 since Michael Penix Jr. is coming off a torn ACL suffered in Week 12 last season. The Falcons plan to release Kirk Cousins, so we'll see who ends up competing with Penix for the starting job, and hopefully that quarterback will lean heavily on Pitts.And this is where Stefanski's history of tight ends should matter for Pitts. There were four times during Stefanski's six-year stint in Cleveland when his tight end was either first or second on the team in targets, including 2025 when rookie Harold Fannin Jr. led the team with 107.David Njoku had 97 targets in just 11 games in 2024, which was third best for the Browns overall. Njoku was also second in targets in 2023 with 123. And Austin Hooper was second on the team in targets in 2020 and 2021.\nStefanski will likely feature Pitts as much as possible, and he should be at least second on the team in targets behind Drake. It's why I would consider drafting Pitts, as of now, as the No. 8 tight end off the board behind Trey McBride, Bowers, Colston Loveland, Fannin, Tyler Warren, Tucker Kraft and Sam LaPorta. And you can start to look for Pitts as early as Round 7 in all leagues.There are still things to monitor for Pitts prior to the start of the season. Will he accept the franchise tag without an issue, or will he holdout in training camp? Who will be Atlanta's starting quarterback in 2026? What other additions will be made to the roster, including the potential of another tight end being added?We'll see how this all shakes out over the next few months. For now, we're glad Pitts is staying in Atlanta. Stefanski and Pitts should be a good pairing. And we know Ryan loves Pitts and will hopefully bring out the best in him once again.\n-30-\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The PGA Tour schedule shifts East for the Florida Swing beginning this week as the 2026 Cognizant Classic brings the Tour to the Palm Beaches, where players will attempt to tame the Bear Trap at PGA National's Champion Course. After back-to-back signature events -- and another coming next week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational -- many of the world's best will take a week off, which creates an opportunity for those in the field to pick up a win and/or some valuable FedEx Cup points. The betting favorite entering the week is Ryan Gerard, who has a pair of top 10s already this season and picked up his first career win last year at the Barracuda Championship. Other rising stars in the field include Michael Thorbjornsen, the Højgaard twins and Rasmus Neergaard-Peterson, who will all look to get in the winner's circle and add to their strong early-career résumés. They'll be challenged by some veterans looking to get back on track with notable names like Shane Lowry, Daniel Berger, Will Zalatoris, Max Homa, Tom Kim and Brooks Koepka all in the field. They are all looking to get back in the winner's circle and reestablish themselves as threats on the PGA Tour. Koepka is particularly intriguing as he continues his quest for form in his return from LIV Golf. That battle between veterans and rising stars will be fascinating to watch this week at PGA National, and here's how you can watch all of the action this week in the Palm Beaches. 2026 Cognizant Classic TV scheduleRound 1 - ThursdayRound 1 starts: 6:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 6:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveLive TV coverage: 2-6 p.m. on Golf ChannelRadio: 12-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 2 - FridayRound 2 starts: 6:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 6:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveLive TV coverage: 2-6 p.m. on Golf ChannelRadio: 12-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 3 - SaturdayRound 3 starts: 7:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 7:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on PeacockLive TV coverage: 3-6 p.m. on NBCLive streaming: 3-6 p.m. on PeacockRadio: 1-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 7:45 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 7:45 a.m. - 6 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelLive TV coverage: 3-6 p.m. on NBCLive streaming: 3-6 p.m. on Peacock\nRadio: 1-6 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            ",

    "body": "\n        Not all losses are equal. Some can be shrugged off and explained away. Others are harder to hand-wave. The Knicks have had a couple of the tougher-to-explain variety recently, including a nationally streamed no-show in Cleveland earlier this week when the Cavaliers beat them by 15 and didn't break much of a sweat doing it. In an unsurprising development, the Knicks weren't exactly happy with their performance. Josh Hart said they were \"still figuring out the style we want to play, the identity we want to play.\" This late in the season, that kind of admission might as well be an alarm. Hart added that \"time is of the essence.\"He's not kidding. With the regular season funneling toward its conclusion and the playoffs looming, how concerned should the Knicks be right now? Or, for that matter, how worried should the surging Cavaliers be about the injury to James Harden's thumb? Or what about the Lakers, who have recently suffered some bad losses and are possibly in danger of dropping into the play-in?There is no shortage of potential problems facing a whole host of teams as the postseason approaches, from shaky play to the health of key personnel. What follows is our evaluation of various issues, from the merely nagging to the truly troublesome. Each organization will be assigned a Concern Level ranging from 1-to-10, with 1 representing not much to sweat over and 10 being they might as well book those tickets to Cancun now because this can't possibly end well. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    New York KnicksConcern level: 6.5Beating some good teams would calm the nerves. Since we started with the Knicks, we might as well continue. The good news is that they've won 12 of their last 16 games. Over that stretch, they have the best net rating in the NBA. The bad news is that the Cavs are only a half-game behind them for third in the conference, and three of those four losses were ugly enough that Hart got in his feelings about it. A little more than a week ago, FanDuel had the Knicks installed as the favorites to win the Eastern Conference. Now -- with +450 odds -- they're fourth behind the Cavaliers, Celtics and Pistons. That kind of precipitous dip happens when you struggle against quality competition. In addition to falling to the Cavs, the Pistons beat the Knicks at Madison Square Garden by 15 in the first game after the All-Star Break. Detroit has won all three games against New York this season, and the Knicks are minus-84 in those meetings. New York is just 17-17 against teams that are .500 or better, and the upcoming schedule looks a bit tricky. The Knicks' next game is at Milwaukee against a confounding Bucks team that has somehow won eight of 10. Then they're at home against the Thunder before heading off on a five-game road trip that starts in Denver and includes the dreaded watch-out-for-the-undefeated-nightlife back-to-back in Los Angeles against the Lakers and Clippers. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Cleveland CavaliersConcern level: 5It's Harden's non-shooting hand, but we checked and he uses both to dribble.The Cavs are a surprise addition here. After an uneven start, they've recently taken off, winning 14 of 17 -- including all but one game that James Harden played in since being traded to Cleveland. Everything was going about as well as the Cavs could have reasonably hoped -- until it wasn't. On Wednesday, the Cavs announced that Harden injured his right thumb and has a non-displaced fracture. That's obviously not great news for Harden or Cleveland. Ballpark estimates on that kind of injury have players missing an average of 6.5 games or roughly 17 days, provided no surgery is needed. Harden is left-handed, and it appears for now that he'll try to play through it. Reports indicated that he won't need surgery and that he'll wear a wrap or splint on the thumb. Harden was initially listed as questionable for Wednesday's game in Milwaukee, and there were reports that he planned to play before he was downgraded to out. His next opportunity to play is Friday in Detroit. Donovan Mitchell (groin) and Evan Mobley (calf) also sat out the loss to the Bucks in the second night of a back-to-back. \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles LakersConcern level: 8This Big Three can only take them so far.The Lakers are one game behind the Wolves for fifth in the Western Conference and two up on the Suns for the sixth, but staying out of the play-in feels more uncertain by the day. The Celtics embarrassed them at home this week, then the Lakers followed up that indignity by losing to the Magic when Luka Dončić short-circuited at the end of the game.\nOn the whole, Dončić, LeBron James and Austin Reaves are a top-tier trio -- but they can only do so much, and there aren't a lot of options to lighten their collective burden.Here's a fun game (OK, JJ Redick would not think it's fun): Who's the fourth-best player on the Lakers? If it's DeAndre Ayton, they're in trouble. (Spoiler: it's not DeAndre Ayton.) Ditto Marcus Smart, who started and had zero points in a blowout loss to the Celtics at home this week. Rui Hachimura has been so uninspiring that he was demoted to a bench role in favor of Smart. After that, we're into Jake LaRavia and Jaxson Hayes territory. That overall roster is grim. \nThe Lakers are 11th in offensive rating but just 24th on defense, and their minus-0.3 point differential is the worst among the top eight teams in the Western Conference. If we expand further to include all 20 teams currently in position for the play-in or playoffs in both conferences, only the Blazers, Clippers and Hawks have worse point differentials. Hardly encouraging.  \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Golden State WarriorsConcern level: 8.5If Curry doesn't come back fully healthy, they're cooked (and they probably are even if he does). The Warriors lost to the Pelicans in New Orleans this week, which would have been a blow all by itself. On that same night, Jonathan Kuminga had 27 points against the Zombie Wizards in his debut for Hawks, while his former Golden State teammates mustered a total of 26 bench points. There's a joke about Kuminga and karma in there somewhere. \nThe Warriors are two games behind the Suns for seventh in the West and four back of the Lakers (who, as we established, have three players who don't make Redick want to walk into the Pacific Ocean and let the tide take him out). Golden State is 12-17 on the road, 22-26 when their opponents score 100+, and 14-19 against teams .500 or better. None of that is good.Worst of all: Steph Curry is still dealing with a knee injury. The 37-year-old hasn't played in nearly a month, and the timetable for his return remains unclear. The vibes are not great in Golden State. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Denver NuggetsConcern level: 4If they get healthy, they're gonna be a problem. The problem is they're not healthy.\nOn paper, this is the deepest team that the Nuggets have ever assembled around Nikola Jokić. Unfortunately for Denver, the paper in question is an injury report, and pretty much everyone on the roster has landed on it at some point this season.Given all the injuries, it's remarkable the Nuggets are fourth in the West. Four of the Nuggets' five original starters have been unavailable for big chunks of the season. Jokić missed 16 straight games, and the Nuggets are 5-6 since he returned. Cameron Johnson and Christian Braun are back in the lineup after missing a combined 60 games. In their absence, Peyton Watson stepped up and was having a career season before he went down with a hamstring injury. Aaron Gordon has played just 23 games this season. Like Watson, he's also dealing with a hamstring injury. Both players are out indefinitely. Through it all, their iron man has been first-time All-Star Jamal Murray. Murray has played in 54 of the Nuggets' 59 games and is averaging a team-high 34.9 minutes. Naturally, he left Wednesday evening's win over the Celtics after eight minutes and did not return due to a reported illness. \nAdding to the already high degree of difficulty in Denver, the top-rated offense is periodically undone by the 20th-ranked defense. And on top of everything, the Nuggs have the hardest remaining strength of schedule, and they have six games remaining against the Thunder and Spurs.\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Houston RocketsConcern level: 4.5There are questions, including about KD's social media use.The Rockets are at their best when they're dominating the offensive glass and getting a ton of second-chance opportunities. The double-big lineup that they hit on last season and used to great effect this year has been their preferred way to play -- which is why losing Steven Adams to a season-ending ankle injury was such a blow. The Rockets are first in offensive rebounds per game and second in second-chance points. But since Adams last played on Jan. 18, the Rockets have fallen to seventh and 12th in those respective categories. (It seems that Clint Capela wasn't the hedge against a big-man injury that they hoped he'd be. He's playing about 12 minutes per game in Adams's absence and has been largely ineffective.)\nThat's one problem. Among the others: the Rockets are sixth in 3-point percentage but next-to-last in attempts. The lack of reliable shooting has caused problems in tight situations, where the Rockets are 14-16 in Clutch games. And then for not-so-good measure, Kevin Durant had to field questions after the All-Star break about whether he has a secret burner account where he dunks on his teammates.   \n\n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Phoenix SunsConcern level: 7Given their history, LeBron is probably super bummed that Brooks won't be available for Thursday's game in LA.The Suns have been one of the pleasant surprises of the season. Aside from ever-optimistic owner Mat Ishbia, not many people predicted Phoenix would be a play-in team this season with a real shot of landing in the top six. \nJalen Green missed all but 11 games with a hamstring injury and only recently returned. But just when the Suns got him back, they lost Dillon Brooks, who broke his hand and is expected to miss 4-6 weeks. Meanwhile, Devin Booker strained his right hip and will be reevaluated next week. That's two critical starters whom the Suns can ill afford to lose. Booker and Brooks have logged 1,047 minutes together this season, the third-most of any two-man combo for the Suns. Unsurprisingly, they have the highest offensive rating of any Phoenix duo. Without them on the floor, the offense sputters. In their last two games, the Suns scored 81 points against the Celtics and only 77 against the Blazers. Both of those games were in Phoenix. Not great. \n                            \n    \n                                                \n                    \n    Los Angeles ClippersConcern level: N/AThe CL scale doesn't go that high.Umm, let's see. They traded two of their five starters and sent James Harden to Cleveland and Ivica Zubac to Indiana. Darius Garland participated in five-on-five practice this week, but he has a lingering toe issue that has limited him to 26 games this season. They're 13-18 away from the Ballmer Bowl™️, their point differential is minus-0.5, and they're 14-22 against teams .500 or better. They're also 19-29 when opponents score 100 or more. Reader, this is the NBA. Good chance that any given team goes for more than 100 on any given night. Oh yeah, and they're being investigated for possible cap circumvention and tampering. Benedict Mathurin has looked good, though.\n            ",

    "description": "\n        The New York Jets are trading edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II to the Tennessee Titans in exchange for nose tackle T'Vondre Sweat, CBS Sports ",
    "body": "\n        The New York Jets are trading edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II to the Tennessee Titans in exchange for nose tackle T'Vondre Sweat, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirms. The trade cannot be processed until March, when the new league year begins. Johnson is a former first-round pick, selected by the Jets with the No. 26 overall pick in 2022 under Robert Saleh. He reunites with Saleh, whom the Titans hired to replace Brian Callahan as coach. The Jets dealt away other first-rounders recently, also shipping off cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts and defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys at the trade deadline. Johnson played in 14 games for New York last season, starting 13, and finished with 43 combined tackles, including 22 solo tackles, six quarterback hits and 3.0 sacks. In 47 games across four seasons, the 27-year-old has 131 tackles, 27 quarterback hits and 13 sacks. His best season came in 2023, when his career-best 7.5 sacks helped earn him Pro Bowl honors.  Sweat was a 2024 second-round pick of the Titans, recording 85 tackles and three sacks throughout his first two seasons. The Jets had a need to fill when it came to their run defense, as they allowed the fourth-most rushing yards last year (2,371).\nThe Jets have the No. 2 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft while the Titans hold the fourth selection.Here are Zach Pereles' trade grades:Jets: B+Sweat is a big, big man -- 6-4 and 366 pounds -- but he's more than just heft in the middle. Pro Football Focus rated him as the fifth-best interior defensive lineman in the NFL and the fourth-best against the run in 2025. Though he's not as much of a pass rusher as his now-former fellow Titans interior defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, he's not a complete zero there, either: He had a 9.4% pressure rate, a respectable if not spectacular number. His 74.1 pass rush grade from PFF was 19th out of 112 interior defenders.Sweat isn't a full-time player. He played two-thirds of the Titans' snaps as a rookie, when he appeared in all 17 games, and only about half of their snaps last year. And that number only factors in when he was available; he missed five games due to an ankle injury. That's why landing in New York makes sense. The Jets don't have depth at many spots, but they do have it along the interior of the defensive line. Harrison Phillips is a dependable veteran, and former Browns seventh-round pick Jowon Briggs impressed after being acquired over the summer. It's a solid group for a defense that allowed 46 explosive rushes last year, tied for sixth-most in the NFL.\nMore than anything, though, the Jets get a strong grade for three reasons. First, Sweat still has two more years remaining on his rookie deal; Johnson only has one, and it's his fifth-year option. That's a win for a team in the early days of a rebuild. If Sweat plays well in 2026, he's still cheap in 2027. Second, Sweat (24) is two-and-a-half years younger than Johnson (27). It's not a massive differentiating factor, but it is worth mentioning.Third, the Jets have the No. 2 overall pick in the NFL Draft, and they can clearly set their sights on adding another EDGE defender opposite Will McDonald IV. Arvell Reese leads a strong EDGE group that also includes Rueben Bain and David Bailey. New York, which also has the No. 16 pick (as part of the Gardner trade), the No. 33 pick and the No. 44 pick (as part of the Williams trade) can build in earnest on both sides of the ball. It was a rough first year for Aaron Glenn in the Big Apple, but with a run-stuffing defensive lineman in tow and plenty of draft picks upcoming (including three first-rounders in 2027), brighter days could be ahead.Titans: B-Perhaps we should have seen this coming when, Tuesday, Saleh said, \"[Sweat's] a big man, and he has much faster feet that people realize. Is it going to be easy for him? It's not, it's a lot of work and it is physically demanding to play d-line in our system.\"\nThe Titans desperately needed pass rush help. After Simmons' 11 sacks, the team's sack leaders were Jihad Ward's (five) and Dre'Mont Jones and Jaylen Harrell's (4.5). Ward is entering free agency, and Jones was traded midseason to the Ravens.Whether Johnson can provide that pass-rushing boost is another question. Johnson's 2023 -- under Saleh -- was outstanding, but he tore his Achilles early in 2024, and he wasn't nearly the same in 2025. His 9.5% pressure rate was 110th out of 184 players who rushed the passer at least 200 times. It'd be foolish to write off a player one year after he came back from injury, but it'd also be foolish to write off the injury altogether.The fact that Johnson is going into the fifth-year option of his rookie deal and Sweat still has two more years on his rookie deal does hurt Tennessee's grade a touch.\nSaleh has changed the look of his team dramatically in the weeks since taking the job. This trade came one day after Tennessee released starting center Lloyd Cushenberry and starting safety Xavier Woods. The Titans have the most cap space in the NFL (nearly $100 million in effective cap space, per Over The Cap) and the No. 4 pick, which it can still use on a pass rusher or a defensive back or an addition to Cam Ward's offense. Pairing Simmons with a disruptive edge player is a solid strategy, and if Johnson recaptures his 2023 form, it could be much more than that.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Free-agent starting pitcher Max Scherzer is headed back to the Blue Jays on an incentive-laden $3 million contract, per Sportsnet. He joins a talented stable of starting pitchers, though one with plenty of question marks. Kevin Gausman and Dylan Cease stand at the top, rookie Trey Yesavage and inconsistent José Berríos are also in the mix, as are Scherzer and Cody Ponce, who is returning to MLB from Korea. Shane Bieber is dealing with forearm fatigue and will get a late start to the season. The Blue Jays, of course, are looking to get back to the World Series after falling just short of a title last year.Much more interesting when it comes to Scherzer, though, is his career as a whole. He'll be 41 years old this season and has battled injuries the last several years, going back to his injury during the 2019 World Series. That is to say that this might well be his swan song. What a career it has been. If you're curious about whether or not he's going to be a Hall of Famer, I can just let you know right now that he is absolutely going to make it. In parts of 18 seasons, Scherzer is 221-117, having led his league in wins four times. He has a 3.22 ERA (131 ERA+) and 1.08 WHIP -- he led his league in WHIP five times. \nWhen it comes to the counting stats, Scherzer is likely to hit two milestones this season. He's already topped 3,000 strikeouts and that's well in the rearview, but he's only 11 from 3,500, having already recorded 3,489 in his career. It means much less to the baseball world than 3,000, but only 10 pitchers have ever reached 3,500 strikeouts and the top 10 is within reach; Walter Johnson is 10th all-time with 3,509. In fact, it seems possible that Scherzer could climb as high as seventh on the all-time list this season. 6. Tom Seaver, 3,640 strikeouts7. Don Sutton, 3,5748. Justin Verlander, 3,5539. Gaylord Perry, 3,53410. Walter Johnson, 3,50911. Max Scherzer, 3,489Verlander is a moving target there, as he's signed with the Tigers for 2026. Scherzer had 82 strikeouts in 17 starts last season, so finishing around Sutton is a reasonable prediction, though it's likely Verlander stays ahead. That means, in this case, Scherzer would finish the season in eighth place all-time. \nFurther, Scherzer has 2,963 innings pitched. The 3,000-inning mark isn't quite as ballyhooed as racking up the strikeouts, but Scherzer is likely to become the 139th pitcher ever to hit 3,000 innings. Keep in mind it's a much different game than back in the 1800s and early 1900s. If we limited the scope to just pitchers in the Wild Card Era (1995-present), Scherzer would then become just the 12th pitcher to reach 3,000 innings. The most recent pitchers to get there were Verlander, Zack Greinke and CC Sabathia. Something that isn't required but is always a nice bonus to have here is what I like to call the Feel Factor. Meaning, when you were watching a player during his career, did it feel like you were watching a Hall of Famer? It's just a gut-feel thing and we should be able to answer immediately. With Scherzer, it's one of those easy, slam-dunk, emphatic \"yes\" answers. Think about watching prime Scherzer just stomp around the mound out there, controlling the entire game. He's long had that feel. In terms of awards, Scherzer is one of just 11 pitchers to have won three Cy Youngs. He also finished second once, third twice and fifth twice, giving him seven top-five finishes. He's an eight-time All-Star with two World Series rings. Speaking of, in his postseason career, he has a 3.78 ERA with 182 strikeouts in 157 ⅓ innings. \nBy JAWS, Scherzer is already above the average Hall of Fame starting pitcher at 27th all-time (there are 67 Hall of Fame starters). He's ahead of Nolan Ryan and Roy Halladay, just to name two studs in the same ballpark, and right on the heels of Tom Glavine, Greinke and Fergie Jenkins. What more is there for Scherzer to accomplish? Not much, really. We've already discussed the strikeout and innings milestones within reach, but those are minor. Scherzer's Hall of Fame resume is already overwhelming and complete. He has plenty of money too. He's pitching now for the love of the game and that's pretty admirable in and of itself.\n            ",

The Red Storm went the final 17:28 without making a field goal and scored their fewest amount of points since 2013. During that stretch, St. John's missed 24 consecutive field goals and scored just 14 points in the second half after trailing 41-26 at halftime.The Red Storm shot 6 of 36 (16.7%) on 2-point field goals against UConn, which was the worst field goal percentage by a top-15 team in a game over the last 20 seasons. The 40 points St. John's scored were the fewest points a Pitino-led team finished with in his coaching career. The previous low was 43 points, which happened in 1981 against UCLA when Pitino was coaching Boston University.\"It's all on me,\" Pitino said. \"I'm very disappointed in our performance offensively, especially. Sharing the ball, moving the ball. It's all on me. But we will get ready for Villanova. We are still playing for a league championship. Doesn't matter whether you lose by 1 or 40,  league championship is still at stake. Obviously, we have to make our corrections and move on.\"\nPitino did not attend the standard post-game press conference, but took questions from a small group of reporters after the loss. That session lasted just over a minute. In the final question with reporters before walking away, Pitino was asked to clarify what he meant by the loss being \"all on him,\" in which he responded that he would be making his corrections and \"moving on.\"\nEntering the week, St. John's was one of the hottest teams in college basketball. The Red Storm had won 13 consecutive games while being at the top of the Big East standings with a 15-1 record. The lone loss in conference play (outside of Wednesday) was against Providence at home.\"I don't know what it is,\" Pitino said when asked if the UConn crowd played a factor. \"All I know is we didn't play good offense. We did things we have never done. And again, that's something I got to question about myself and I will question it because the team did not do the things we have done in the last 13 games. Give them the credit. We will move on and get ready for Villanova.\"\nSt. John's finishes the regular season against Villanova, Georgetown and Seton Hall. The Red Storm can clinch at least a share of the Big East regular season title for the second consecutive year under Pitino by winning those final three games.\n            \n",

    "body": "\n        The Big Ten and SEC have submitted a white paper to members of Congress urging lawmakers to reject a proposal that would consolidate college sports media rights under a federally supervised entity, arguing the plan would not deliver the promised revenue gains and could destabilize the conference ecosystem.The nine-page report, obtained Thursday by CBS Sports, directly rebuts a proposal advanced last fall by Saving College Sports (SCS). The group called for pooling the media rights of all 136 Football Bowl Subdivision programs into a single entity, estimating the move could generate roughly $6 billion in incremental revenue through schedule optimization and collective negotiations.The Big Ten and SEC dispute those projections, writing that SCS's claims \"are not supported by any empirical evidence\" and warning that the model would create \"a dangerously unworkable\" structure that introduces new legal and operational risks.The SCS plan -- commissioned by billionaire Texas Tech booster Cody Campbell -- calls for an amendment to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, which would allow FBS schools to negotiate media rights collectively. The plan also calls for the creation of a federally appointed body to administer media contracts and manage scheduling. Supporters argue that pooling rights would dramatically increase football revenue and provide significant financial support for Olympic and women's sports, projecting more than a 67% increase in revenue for those programs.\nThe SEC and Big Ten's counterThe two power conferences counter that media growth is already occurring under the current conference-based model. Recent conference renewals produced a 2.8-times increase in average annual value, matching the NBA's most recent media cycle. The memo states that college football media revenue is projected to surpass SCS's forecast by 2033 without pooling rights or federal oversight.The paper challenges SCS's assertion that the NBA's recent windfall proves aggregation creates value. It argues the league's gains stemmed from market competition and the sale of smaller packages to multiple distributors. Roughly 80% of NBA games are still sold through local agreements rather than a single consolidated package.The Big Ten and SEC also question the logistics of federal administration. The SCS proposal calls for a 14-person committee to oversee negotiations, scheduling and revenue distribution across 136 schools, 26 sports and more than 32,000 games annually. The conferences describe that scope as unworkable and warn that it could erode institutional control over scheduling and rivalries, while imposing uniform national branding at the expense of individual traditions.\nAnother hurdle is the structure of existing contracts among the 10 FBS conferences and Notre Dame. Current media deals run through 2036 on staggered timelines. The white paper argues that breaking or materially altering those agreements to implement pooling would invite legal challenges and undermine long-term investment in the sport.The conferences argue that centralized models have underperformed historically. The NCAA pooled television rights before a 1984 Supreme Court ruling struck down the arrangement. The subsequent College Football Association bundled rights for more than 60 schools in the 1980s but generated less revenue than later conference-level deals. The SEC's first conference-wide agreement in 1996 -- covering 12 schools at $17 million annually -- outperformed the broader CFA package valued at $43.6 million.Under its current deal with ESPN, which runs through 2034, the SEC receives nearly $1 billion annually. The Big Ten collects about $1.1 billion per year in a multi-network agreement through 2030. Over the next decade, those two leagues are projected to roughly double the revenue of the ACC and Big 12 — and significantly outpace the Group of Six conferences.\nThe case for reformSCS supporters argue that disparity underscores the need for reform. American Athletic Conference commissioner Tim Pernetti commissioned a study last year projecting that bundling FBS rights could more than double the current cumulative media value of approximately $3.5 billion annually.\"It's in no way designed to have certain conferences take from others,\" Pernetti told CBS Sports in July. \"This is about creating a larger pie. If there was a way for all media rights revenue to be rolled up and then potentially doubled or tripled, I'm not sure what conference wouldn't sign up for that right now.\"The Sports Broadcasting Act currently prohibits colleges from collectively pooling media rights. A proposal to amend the law gained traction in Washington last fall, though no congressional hearings have been scheduled.\nFederal involvement in college sports has expanded in recent years, with conference and NCAA leaders visiting Washington to lobby for reforms -- including antitrust protections -- ahead of last year's House settlement requiring schools to share revenue with athletes.The proposed SAFE Act would grant limited antitrust protections to allow collective media negotiations and establish a federally structured oversight model for certain aspects of college sports. The SCORE Act would create a national framework for NIL regulation and athlete compensation standards, further codifying the House settlement reached last year.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        You know the 2026 NWSL season is getting closer when teams officially unveil their jerseys. All 16 clubs have a new kit to debut, with two new expansion sides rolling out four shirts between them. Some will be primaries, others will be secondaries, but most are third option kits, and that's where the fun comes in for a few clubs. Today's soccer kit culture is partially about honoring a club's history, but that's not all. In this era, it's about making sure you're doing that while keeping up with current trends to combine with wearability. Nowadays, fans aren't just sporting jerseys on gamedays; they are part of everyday wardrobes and even a form of expression, depending on how one opts to style them.So naturally, with all that in mind, I am totally going to rank the 2026 NWSL kits. What does that mean? What is the hip criteria – no, not that one — that will be used to judge them? Well, for starters, it will just be me and my eyeballs and what I think about them. The truth is that, unlike last year's rollout, where the majority of the kits just seemed aggressively fine, the third kit options are a chance for some fun, so I'll be looking for that too. Significance or special meaning might tip the scales a little bit, but I'm not super interested in 50 different ways to name shades of blue or green.  \nWhile I am an advocate for club shops to offer shorts and team socks to fandoms, the teams' entire \"uniform\" will not matter to me here. What does the shirt look like? Does it look more like a soccer kit or a warm-up outfit? Can you wear it outside of a matchday, and will it look cool on players and on supporters? That's about it. With that, let's get to ranking the 2026 NWSL kits, and don't forget -- you can watch select NWSL games this season on Paramount+.1. Seattle Reign: The Surge (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Truly a love-it-or-hate-it type of kit, and by god, this random writer on the internet loves it. If your team is one that sits on the cool side of the color spectrum, you're ahead of the game because cool colors are, well, cool. Seattle does a good job of throwing it way back to their early shades and paying homage to their \"highlighter\" kits with subtle accents.\nCombined with a bold, kind of random geometric pattern, it's delivering on third kit concepts in general -- fun, confusing, and maybe even soccer moms and dads will wear it alongside their kids. Mia Fishel will look cool scoring goals in it, and the casual fan will have enough flair in the kit to pop outside of gamedays. 2. Kansas City Current: Storm kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            It's hard to make a kit that everyone, whether on the pitch or in the stands, will look good in. But the 2025 NWSL Shield winners did just that. The roster is gonna look edgy in their new Storm kits, a dark navy jersey with teal currents running all over it. The numbers are also in Kansas City's iconic teal hue, and even though it's a third kit, it's exactly the type of jersey you'll want to see your team in regularly if you're a fan. A great color combo that makes the crest pop with its small hints of red, and the details are meant to represent exactly what a water current is with continuous movement throughout.\n3. Chicago Stars FC: Gameday DNA kit (primary)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Chicago finally have the kit that matches their rebrand and is probably the only jersey in the rollout that says \"soccer kit\" the second you look at it. Is it a Serie A side? Is it a Liga MX team? No, it's Chicago's NWSL team, Stars FC, and they are sporting a shirt that is somehow both modern and classic. It still doesn't beat their 2019 \"elevated\" kit in my book, but it's a great start for this next era. Gone are the iconic four red stars across the chest, and that's fine; they belong on the flag, where the club borrows some of its imagery from. Including the striping, the vertical lines narrow as they head outward, just like bars on the city's flag. 4. Angel City FC: Flare kit (primary)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            I need to preface this by saying that I think center crests are dumb. Unless they are used to commemorate a team's achievements -- World Cup wins, Continental tournaments -- leave them where they are supposed to be, on the left-hand side of the shirt. That being said, congrats to Angel City FC, who made sure the kit was so good that it bumped them near the top.\nI think a primary black kit with just the right amount of detail is great, and the organization delivered one to celebrate its fifth anniversary as a club. A cool design that mirrors a sol image and a nod to the pink (sol rosa) accents throughout the kit. You add the number five instead of the letter S in the club's slogan \"VOLEMO5,\" and it's a simple twist that works. 5. Gotham FC: Lady Liberty kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Commiserations to all the New Jersey faithful out there. If Gotham weren't fully separating themselves from the Garden State in name (they dropped NJ/NY in front of their moniker last season), they certainly are now with this extremely, undeniably, New York City kit. Inside Gotham's third kit is a not-so-hidden image of the Statue of Liberty's head. Wrapped in shades of blue and orange, NYC's flag colors, the closer you get, the blurrier it becomes. But that's where the fun lines come into play. The farther away you go, Lady Liberty pops up like a 90's magic eye 3D puzzle you don't have to strain your eyes to see. Not for you? That's ok. Champion sentiment means they get to rock what they want. \n6. Racing Louisville FC: Disco kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Did you know that Louisville makes more than bourbon and baseball bats? At one point, they produced 90% of the world's disco balls during the disco era, and this third kit is a shout-out to that time. It's creative, out-of-the-box look means that instead of just a simple design outlining a disco ball, Racing's kit is a literal reflection. You see splashes of purple and green hues throughout the kit, like lights hitting a mirrored globe, defined by black borders. The pride mark \"Made in Looavul\" is a great way to make sure folks put respect on your name. A great kit and sentiment for a club that's coming off its first playoff appearance. 7. Orlando Pride: Unity kit (secondary)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Speaking of sentimental, Orlando Pride's secondary kit tugs at the heartstrings, and if they didn't, they might not be this high on the rankings. \nAt first glance, you're a bit confused as to why the Pride's purple goes missing for a mix of pastels, and that's a bummer, but then you learn the significance, and you can't help but appreciate it. The kit is a commemoration of the 10-year remembrance of the Pulse Nightclub tragedy. Gone is the typical purple of the Pride; it's just trim color here. In its place is a white base with soft pastel ribbons and a purple \"unity\" dove as a subtle pride mark.It's absolutely a message that everyone should get behind, and one that moves me as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Though in a time where things feel muted, or even shushed, I would've loved to see the Pride lean into what they're actually trying to honor here. A proud, vibrant community. I hope we get another one of these and keep it loud. Keep dancing, Orlando. 8. Washington Spirit: Spirit in Bloom kit (primary)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Fans of the club will finally feel heard and seen as the Spirit roll out a cherry blossom kit that supporters have clamored for. I, too, was hopeful we'd someday see a Spirit cherry blossom kit, and now it's here. A jersey to feature the district's iconic cherry blossom trees and combines a dark green hue that's meant to represent the Potomac River.\nI am a little disappointed that the crest can't really be seen, as it gets a little lost in the pattern. Similar to Gotham, the blossoms seem to bloom a bit better the further away you see them, and the pink numbers will also stand out. Get closer, and it's a little paint-by-numbers. It's definitely miles away from what Spirit kits used to look like, and it keeps that dark green hue that made its way into Spirit gear just last season. 9. North Carolina Courage: Become kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            I'll just be frank, hate the name, but love the concept. This jersey is supposed to be the third component of the Courage's rally cry campaign, \"the place to be,\" and after previous kits \"Believe\" and \"Belong.\" Yeah, I don't get it either, dude, just give me a cool kit. Finally, the Courage have done it with this Venus flytrap-themed kit. It's such a cool concept that it makes me even more annoyed that it's just called \"Become\" and not something else like Audrey or literally even just the Venus flytrap kit. The flytrap is native to North Carolina, and its outline can be seen throughout the entire two shades of blue kit. The bright pink trim on the sleeves also outlines the crest and other areas of the kit for extra detail. \n10. Boston Legacy: First Light (primary) and Common Ground kits (secondary)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Congrats to Boston on making it to the middle of the rankings, and that's absolutely a compliment. Many expansion teams of the past were only able to submit color templates, and while the First Light kit can come off simple, that's not a bad thing. I thought the Common Ground jersey was just a little too color-run-marathon paint splatters for me, but I love that it's actually meant to represent Boston's neighborhoods.  \n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            The outer pride mark adds another nice level of detail to commemorate the inaugural season and the Franklin Park Zoo near White Stadium, featuring two bears holding a soccer ball to honor Legacy's first year. If I'm going with one, I'm rocking the primary kit, an almost neon green vibe that's not too blinding and complements Boston's crest. 10. Bay FC: Poppy kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Bay FC opted to make some simple changes for a fresh look, and it works. After an inaugural season with Dark navy's and subtle grey's, and just a poppy color as more of an accent, the Poppy kit is literally all poppy. The details in the kit are a bridge pattern, but my favorite is the flip of the crest. It's not the typical team crest, but just the letters B. F. C. in an almost gothic-looking script, and I think that's cool for a team that wants to be the best effing club.\n11. Houston Dash: Houston Chronicles kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I kind of miss when the Houston Dash were the orange team. I'm being dramatic since they still have an orange kit, but last year's secondary, and now this year's third option, where's love? I also am gonna contradict myself and say that even for a third kit, it's almost got too much going on.There's an image of the Houston Chronicle building, there's magnolia flowers, there's paisley patterns, geometric textiles, and there's a shout-out to \"Space City\" to reference NASA. It's a map, but also not really. That's where the blue colorway probably works here. I imagine a lot of these patterns and images go missing in an orange hue, and now that I type it all out, it'll probably grow on me. Also, the Cancer touch on the jersey, which has been a staple on their kits, always deserves praise.13. San Diego Wave FC: Balboa Park kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Hopefully, the Balboa Park kit being a third jersey option means there will be more time for the \"del sol\" kit to exist, because unfortunately, it falls a little short, given the bar was set so high by the previous kit. I love the trim on this jersey so much, a nod to the tile work at Balboa Park's fountain, and I wish there was a way it was incorporated more throughout the kit because it goes missing otherwise. 14. Portland Thorns FC: Electric Bloom kit (primary)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Like Houston, I miss when Portland were the red team. The club has drifted into more shades of red than just the color itself, and this kit is no different. It plays up the fact that thorns are indeed on roses, and now they're even incorporating yellow roses. The colors are listed as voltage yellow roses and atomic pink.I do really like the way the club crest looks on this kit and do wonder if it would look this good on a different jersey, but maybe all the elements together are what makes it work. 15. Denver Summit: Evergreen (primary) and Summit Snow (secondary) kits\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Another expansion side that launched two kits, Denver Summit, absolutely nails the colorway with their jerseys but falls short in much else. \n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            You know a jersey is too plain or average when the kit information details are more vivid than what's actually on the shirt. It just kind of looks like they ran out of time or could only pick a template, and might as well go with one that could show off the club colors. That isn't uncommon. There are plenty of expansion sides who've arrived in a similar fashion.Denver have a great club name and a good color scheme, which hopefully means better kits in the future. Let's see those infamous mountains on a kit someday. They could even take some inspiration from their recent crossover promotion with the Denver Nuggets.16. Utah Royals: Swarm kit (third)\n                                                                    Courtesy of NWSL\n                                                            Have you ever gone to a concert or festival, and you're just in the moment vibing, and you happen to walk toward the bathrooms, but a security guard yells at you for trying to go left when you should've turned right? They're mad that they're working the event, and annoyed that you're having fun, and point you in the other direction with their big, bold, yellow lettering? That's what this is for me, unfortunately. It's giving killjoy ops, so it's a pass for me. But because it is a black kit, which are usually winners in my book, it will likely sell and be a favorite among fans. I do hope the Bee theme can be revisited because I would truly want to see what the Royals could do with a bumble bee type of style that doesn't go missing with a lion's head.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        HARTFORD, Conn. — It was the kind of victory that can give a team ultimate belief, because it might be the definitive evidence, that it can win a national championship.It was also the kind of loss that can kill a team's hopes and spirit for the remainder of the season.What sixth-ranked Connecticut did to No. 15 St. John's at PeoplesBank Arena on Wednesday night was more than just a record-setting 32-point evisceration. It was an emphatic socking, the likes of which the Red Storm might not shake off the effects from for weeks, if not until next season. The Huskies' 72-40 vaporizing was arguably the most impressive game played by any team almost four months into this brilliant 2025-26 college basketball campaign.\"What we did today as a rebounding team, as a defensive team, as a team that looked like we did offensively at times in the championship years,\" Huskies coach Dan Hurley told CBS Sports outside the locker room. \"Twenty assists, four turnovers, really, because we took a we took a turnover late in the game. Out-rebounded a team that kicks ass on the glass.\"\nIronically, it was all of a week ago when UConn fell 91-84 at home to mediocre Creighton to take its second loss in four games, bookending that with the 81-72 defeat against St. John's at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 6, when the Johnnies snapped the Huskies' 18-game winning streak.\"The defense has been a joke,\" Hurley said after that loss to Creighton. \"Our defense has been so bad. We've been playing with fire.\"On Wednesday, Hurley's Huskies tamed the flame and used it to burn out the will of St. John's — snapping its 13-game winning streak — and perhaps scorching its chances of doing something of significance over the next month. The Huskies suffocated the Red Storm by doing the near impossible, not allowing a made field goal from the 17:28 mark of the second half until the end of the game. \n\"This is a rivalry,\" Hurley told me, and it was obvious how much pride he felt to win so convincingly with all of the anticipation this game brought. \"I've got a lot of respect for what they do and the amount of success they've had, particularly in Big East play. ... It was a must-win game today.\"\nUConn heating up for March as usual UConn played like the program's existence depended on a victory. Credit to assistant Kimani Young, who was assigned the scout, and whose time to get a head-coaching job at the high-major level is overdue.The Huskies set a program record for their largest win over St. John's, surpassing the 29-point mark from 1998. They also won a home game over a ranked team by 30-plus points for the first time in school history. The game felt near-over at halftime when it was 41-26. Then it felt violent in the final 10 minutes. It felt personal. \nThe UConn team looked — not a lot like — but pretty much exactly like the 2023 and 2024 title-winning squads. There's one eye-opening stat after another attached to this one.The 32-point loss was the worst by St. John's as a ranked team since a 35-point loss to St. Bonaventure in 1960. The Red Storm shot 19.6% on 11-of-56 shooting, the worst shooting performance by any team in Division I this season. It happened because St. John's made its first two field goals of the second half and then missed 24 in a row, also the worst streak by any team in college basketball. \nSJU's best player, Zuby Ejiofor, was held to one point in the first half while his counterpart, senior big man Tarris Reed Jr., finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds, six blocks and two steals in 31 minutes in what was the best game of his career.\"I've never been through that experience,\" Ejiofor said, later adding, \"tonight was not what I was expecting at all.\"Reed became the third Husky to ever log at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks against a ranked team, joining Donovan Clingan (twice) and Emeka Okafor (three times).\nLoss might linger for St. John's  Adding to the embarrassment for Red Storm coach Rick Pitino, he coached a team to just 40 points, marking the lowest of a career that is 1,224 games deep. The previous low came when he was at Boston University in 1981 and his Terriers managed just 43 on the road against UCLA.\"Give [UConn] all the credit,\" Pitino said. \"They played a great game. That's probably only happened to me two times in my career. ... So, it's all on me. I'm very disappointed in our performance offensively, especially sharing the ball, moving the ball. So, it's all on me, but we'll get ready for Villanova.\"\n        \n            \n                Rick Pitino takes blame for St. John's dreadful performance in historic loss to UConn: 'It's all on me'\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nAlthough Pitino credited UConn and did own the loss, he did not handle himself well in the aftermath, which speaks to how much this result obviously and understandably burns him. Still, Pitino easily could have walked to the press conference room and taken questions for four or five minutes but opted not to — something that the Big East office will not appreciate — and instead gave one statement and took one question from a reporter, totaling less than 1 minute and 15 seconds after one of the two most important Big East games of the season.\n\"We're still playing for a championship,\" Pitino said. \"It doesn't matter whether you lose by one or 40, the league championship's still at stake. Obviously, we got to make our corrections and move on.\"The loss looks all the worse coming mere hours after this social media post from Pitino earlier on Wednesday.\nThe Red Storm's résumé looks fairly weak in light of this loss by the way. Its only two quality wins are home against UConn (extremely good) and on the road against Villanova (pretty good). At 22-6, the Johnnies are well on their way to earning a single-digit NCAA seed, but it felt like there was a fracture here in Hartford. SJU is now 1-4 against ranked teams this season. \nMeantime, UConn 29-12 against AP-ranked teams the last four seasons, the most wins of any team in the sport. The Huskies look dynasty-good again. The Red Storm need to do more to prove last year wasn't a one-off pop back into relevancy. This game was supposed to be for the supremacy of the Big East. Maybe it was.And maybe it's going to result in UConn ascending to the top tier of national title contender beside Duke, Michigan and Arizona, while St. John's settles into something inferior. Their league records are tied, it's true, with both at two losses apiece. St. John's still has three more games left, including next up hosting Villanova in a huge game for seeding and the Big East race.\nUConn will finish atop the league if it handles business vs. Seton Hall and at Marquette, both likelihoods.I asked Hurley if he used any special or different motivation tactics in advance of Wednesday's historic outcome.\"Nothing,\" he said. \"Coming out of the Creighton game, we got complacent going into that game. And because we played so well at Creighton, I think maybe I didn't have the team as ready as I needed to, and it put us in this must-win situation the rest of the way to win the regular season. The team is playing right now like these are elimination games, and it's a good time of year to play with that level of desperation. The fact that we have to win every game the rest of the way to get at least a piece of the regular season, the Big East has forced us to have to play like playoff Game 7s right now, and I think that's going to bode well for us the rest of the way.\"\nHurley has built up and fortified one of the toughest programs in college basketball. A championship-level outfit that is required to carry over year to year. Teams that operate at that standard aren't just capable of, but actually provide evidence to the type of supremacy on display Wednesday night. Just about everyone — Ejiofor included — wants to see the third act in Midtown Manhattan on Saturday, March 14. The Big East championship game. But if we don't get it, UConn's win on Wednesday and the aftereffects may well be the reason. The Huskies are the fourth projected No. 1 seed, and it's hard to see them spoiling that spot until the Big East title game at the absolute earliest. These teams' seasons collided in Hartford, and given how violent the impact was, it's hard to see both going in similar directions the rest of the season.\n            ",

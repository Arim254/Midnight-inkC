The Over is 8-5 across the last 13 Arizona games.One of SportsLine's top experts has also locked in a pick from LSU vs. Tennessee in an SEC battle at 6 p.m. ET.

Anyone following its college basketball betting advice at sportsbooks and on betting apps could have seen strong returns.Saturday best bets at DraftKings SportsbookTennessee (-14.5) vs. LSU (-110)Over 157.5 for Arizona vs. Texas Tech (-105)Over 138.5 for UConn vs. Georgetown (-110)Combining the three picks into a Saturday parlay at DraftKings would result in a payout of +612 (risk $100 to win $612). Bet it at DraftKings here: (Odds subject to change):Tennessee (-14.5) vs. LSU (-110)\n\"This feels like a smash spot for Tennessee,\" SportsLine expert Thomas Casale said. \"One thing I look for in the final months is teams likely to make a coaching change. Matt McMahon is probably out at LSU, and I have to wonder if the players are focused on the rest of the season or the transfer portal. The Tigers are just 2-9 in SEC play and coming off back-to-back home losses to Georgia and Arkansas by a combined 41 points. LSU could also be without leading scorer Dedan Thomas for the fourth straight game. I wish the Vols shot free throws a little better, but dominating the offensive glass and getting easy baskets off turnovers should be enough to cover.\" Back Tennessee to cover at DraftKings here:Over 157.5 for Arizona vs. Texas Tech (-105)\"Texas Tech has played seven games against power conference opponents that finished with 70 or more possessions. The totals in those games, all decided in regulation, were 155, 162, 182, 163, 140, 167 and 158,\" SportsLine expert Chip Patterson said. \"The thought here is that when the Red Raiders get sped up the totals creep up as well, and Arizona is the most up-tempo team in Big 12 play. Arizona's interior defense is really going to force Texas Tech to connect from outside, but the Red Raiders are currently leading the Big 12 with 41.2% three-point shooting in conference play. With Arizona looking to bounce back from the Kansas loss and Texas Tech desperate to improve its 3-3 road record, count on 70-plus possessions and a higher-scoring affair in Tucson.\" Back the Over at DraftKings here:Over 138.5 for UConn vs. Georgetown (-110)The Over has hit in six straight UConn games, with all six totals set at 136.5 points or greater, including five games set at more than 142 points. The Huskies cleared the Over by at least five points in five of those six games, in large part due to their own offensive domination. UConn has scored at least 85 points in three of its last five games. Meanwhile, Georgetown went Over in its last game, an 80-73 loss to Villanova on Feb. 7. Georgetown has the 128th-ranked scoring defense in the nation, allowing 73 points per game this season. The model projects the Over to hit in 78% of simulations. Back the Over at DraftKings here:\nWant more college basketball picks on Saturday?You've seen some of the model's Saturday best bets.

    "body": "\n        The NASCAR season officially gets revved up on Sunday, Feb. 15, when the checkered flag drops on the 2026 Daytona 500. The race is scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on FOX. This NASCAR betting guide provides information for new and veteran sports bettors alike, including where to wager on the 2026 Daytona 500 and popular betting markets for the NASCAR Cup Series season opener.Where to bet on the 2026 Daytona 500Here are some available sportsbook promos new users can receive when signing up for a sportsbook and wagering on the 2026 Daytona 500.BrandPromoCBS promo codeDraftKingsBet $5, get $300 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereFanDuelBet $5, get $100 in bonus bets if your bet winsJust click hereCaesarsFirst bet matched up to $250 in bonus bets, win or lose CBSSPORTS250BMBetMGMUp to $1,500 in bonus bets back if your first bet losesCBSSPORTSFanatics10 x $100 Bet Match in FanCashCBSFANbet365Bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets instantlyCBSBET365Betting on NASCAR and the 2026 Daytona 500Like most sports, there are hundreds of options across the major sportsbooks that bettors can choose from when wagering on NASCAR. The Daytona 500 odds available at sportsbooks include which driver will win the race, as well as the race team and manufacturer the winning driver represents. Many sportsbooks offer head-to-head matchups between Daytona 500 favorites, as well as groups of drivers where you can pick who finishes highest among them. You can also pick a driver to finish in the top three, top five, top 10 and even top 20 at some books, lowering your payout but giving you a better chance to cash in. The sportsbooks also have NASCAR futures, including Cup Series odds on series champion and over/unders on driver victories for the season.Bet on the 2026 Daytona 500 at BetMGM here:Race winnerThe major sportsbooks are in agreement that Ryan Blaney, Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin and pole-sitter Kyle Busch are the favorites, with Logano and Blaney at least co-favorites at most of them. That quartet shares co-favorite status at +1200 at bet365 and Caesars, but Logano is the +1000 top choice at FanDuel while Hamlin is +900 favorite at DraftKings, followed by the other three at +1000. Blaney and Logano are co-favorites at both Fanatics (+1000) and BetMGM (+1200). Austin Cindric, who won at Daytona in 2022, isn't far behind the favorites, priced at +1400 or +1600 at most sportsbooks. But if you are keen on the former Cup Series Rookie of the Year, you can get odds of +2000 on him to win at DraftKings. Kyle Larson, the 2025 Cup Series champion, ranges anywhere from +1400 (Caesars) to +2000 (FanDuel).The sportsbooks see William Byron, the 2025 regular-season champ and the two-time defending Daytona 500 champ, having a solid chance to win his third in a row to open the NASCAR season. He is +1400 at DraftKings and BetMGM and bet365 and Caesars (+1800). Byron finished second at last week's Clash at Bowman Gray, and the winner of that preseason race, Ryan Preece, is anywhere from +2200 (Caesars) to +3250 (Fanatics). Other drivers expected to be in the mix for the victory include Chase Elliott -- he is anywhere from +1300 at Fanatics to +1600 at DraftKings -- and Brad Keselowski (+1600 at at Caesars, +2200 at bet365).Bet on the winner of the Daytona 500 at Fanatics now:More Daytona 500 oddsYou can make Daytona 500 predictions and picks on any number of outcomes from Sunday's race. You can bet on a driver to finish anywhere from first to within the top 20, and there are bets available on most laps led, team and manufacturer results. There are even over/unders on the winning car number, how many cars will finish on the lead lap and most laps led by any single driver.BetMGM sets the over/under on the winning car number at 19.5, with both sides priced at -115. Caesars sets four ranges for the winning car number -- 0-8 (+275), 9-18 (+260), 19-28 (+300) and 29+ (+165). The sportsbook also has three over/under options, with 19.5 set at the same odds as BetMGM, while it also has 12.5 (Over -225, Under +175) and 22.5 (Over +175, Under -225). At BetMGM and Fanatics, you can get +100 if the winning car sports an odd number in an even/odd wager, with even priced at -115 at BetMGM and -135 at Fanatics. Caesars has tons of prop bets, including +185 odds on whether a past Daytona 500 winner will be first to the checkered flag and -200 odds on the race to go to overtime. It also has over/unders on the number of drivers to lead a lap (18.5), and over/under on lead changes (46.5), among many other options. Bet on your favorite Daytona 500 props at Caesars Sportsbook here:Race finishes Most of these odds are similar to the Daytona 500 race winner odds, though the payout is decreased because of the lower difficulty. If you think a driver can win but aren't quite sure, you can pick them for a high finish and have a better chance at a payout. At bet365, the four favorites are also the top four choices to finish in the top three, with all four priced at +1200 to win and +400 for a top-three finish. At Caesars, Blaney, Busch, Hamlin and Logano are all +1200 to win, but Blaney, Logano and Chase Elliott are favored to finish among the top three at +330. Busch is +500 and Hamlin +600.     Elliott also is among the favorites to finish in the top five at FanDuel, joining Logano as the +160 top choice, just ahead of Blaney (+170). But at BetMGM, Elliott is +225 for a top-five finish, well behind favorites Blaney and Logano (+130). For top-10 wagers -- and top 20 at sportsbooks that offer them --- you'll be paying a lot of juice. The quartet of favorites at bet365 are -145 to finish in the top 10, while DraftKings has Hamlin as the -200 favorite. BetMGM has Blaney and Logano priced at -190. FanDuel has odds on various combinations, with many of the top drivers paired up in double chance bets where you win if either takes the checkered flag. Blaney OR Logano to win is the +550 top choice, followed by Logano/Cindric at +600. There are also triple chance options, and Blaney/Logano/Larson and Logano/Hamlin/Cindric are the +420 favorites in those odds. On other either/or bets at FanDuel, you can wager on whether one of two specified drivers places within certain finish parameters. For example, it sets a +140 payout if Hamlin OR Cindric finishes in the top five. There are also numerous combo bet options at bet365.   Bet on where your favorite drivers will finish in the 2026 Daytona 500 at FanDuel here:Team/manufacturer resultsTeam Penske is the favorite to be the winning race team at most sportsbooks, priced at +350 at Fanatics and Caesars and +370 at FanDuel and DraftKings. Hendrick Motorsports is right behind at +375 at both bet365 and Caesars, +380 at DraftKings and +410 at FanDuel. Joe Gibbs Racing is +400 at Draftkings and +500 at FanDuel and Caesars.   The Hendrick stable includes Byron, Larson, Elliott and Alex Bowman, while Penske boasts Blaney, Cindric and Logano. Gibbs has Hamlin, Briscoe, Christopher Bell and Ty Gibbs, but a team like RFK Racing (+750 at FanDuel) with a roster including Chris Buescher, Keselowski and Preece, might be enticing. Busch is part of the two-car Richard Childress team, along with Austin Dillon, and RCR is +800 at DraftKings and +900 at Caesars. But unless you like Dillon's chances to win -- he's +5000 at many sportsbooks and +3000 at DraftKings -- you should be able to get better odds on Busch to win. Chevrolet is favored to win as the manufacturer at most books, though Caesars has Ford with a slight edge at +130, ahead of Chevy at +140. The difference is much greater at FanDuel, which has Chevrolet +125 and Ford +170, and DraftKings, which prices them at +115 and +190, respectively. Toyota is third across the board, with a high payout of +325 (Caesars) and a low of +230 (FanDuel)  Among the Chevrolet drivers are Byron, Larson, Busch and Elliott, while Blaney, Logano and Cindric are among those piloting Fords. Hamlin drives a Toyota, and he is the clear favorite to be the top finisher for that manufacturer, priced at +215 at DraftKings, with Christopher Bell next at +500. Busch is the +380 top choice among Chevy drivers, followed by Byron (+550), Larson (+650) and Elliott (+650), and the Ford favorites at DratftKings are Blaney and Logano, both +300.Bet on the top teams and manufacturers in the 2026 Daytona 500 at DraftKings Sportsbook here:Head-to-head/group wagersOne of the most fun ways to make Daytona 500 picks is to choose a head-to-head matchup or group wager. You can pick a driver you think is much better than the ones he is grouped with, or pick your favorite driver against one you might not be so fond of in a head-to-head. The head-to-head matchups are often close to even odds, like with Larson and Hamlin both listed at -110 in their head-to-head at BetMGM. But some matchups can offer a plus-money payout, like in the case of Hamlin vs. Larson at DraftKings. Hamlin is priced at -140 to finish higher in the matchup, with Larson bringing a +105 payout if he does. Some books, like bet365, offer more head-to-head matchups and more that can pay plus-money.Most of the sportsbooks also offer groups of four drivers, with the bet cashing if you pick the driver with the best finish. At FanDuel, one group includes Blaney (+210), Logano (+200), Larson (+350) and Byron (+290), while another consists of Alex Bowman (+185), Connor Zilisch (+230), Daniel Suarez (+270) and AJ Allmendinger (+390). BetMGM has some evenly-matched groups, with one including Chase Briscoe (+270), Chris Buescher (+270), Carson Hocevar (+280) and Ryan Preece (+280) and another with Ty Gibbs, Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Daniel Suarez and Michael McDowell where all four are priced at +275.Make head-to-head and group wagers on the 2026 Daytona 500 at BetMGM here:NASCAR and 2026 Daytona 500 betting strategiesBetting on a driver to win might seem like the best option when you think of wagering on auto racing, and while it is profitable if you cash the bet, that's not easy to do. There were 14 different winners over the 36 races in last season's Cup Series, though several drivers managed to win multiple races. Hamlin led the way with six, followed by Rookie of the Year Shane van Gisbergen, who earned five (all on road courses). Christopher Bell and Ryan Blaney each had four victories and Chase Briscoe, William Byron and Kyle Larson had three. Using some combination of your favorites in a double/triple-chance wager could be the good way to go. The payout is lower, but much like in golf, hitting an outright winner isn't as easy as it might seem.The safest bets that can still earn a decent payout are on the high finishers. Larson, Briscoe and Blaney all had a series-high 15 top-five finishes in 2025, and Larson and Christopher Bell led with 22 races where they placed in the top 10. Drivers who showed consistency while coming up short of a victory were Alex Bowman and Chris Buescher, who both failed to win but had 16 top-10 finishes. And while Blaney won four times, he had eight DNFs in his Ford. Failing to finish is a real possibility for anyone at the Daytona 500, where at least one big crash is expected, often as drivers battle on the later laps. That has opened the door for some surprise winners in the past, with Dillon leading just one lap in overtime when he won in 2018 and Michael McDowell doing the same after a crash in 2021. The volatility of super-speedway racing, especially at the end of races, make this a good time to look for value in long shots.      Weather also could come into play at Daytona, and rain is not unusual on Florida's east coast this time of year. An area of low pressure is making its way south and could arrive Sunday near the time the checkered flag is scheduled to drop. The most likely scenario seems to be scattered showers late in the afternoon and evening. Last season's Daytona 500 saw two delays that totaled more than three hours and 30 minutes, and the 2020 and 2022 races were pushed to Monday. Drivers like Larson, Chastain and Byron charge hard early in races, and Logano is known to be strong on restarts, and both can be critical skills in a race that could see several cautions or even be shortened. Four Daytona 500s, including the 2003 and 2009 editions, have been called after the halfway point because of rain.If you have access to multiple sportsbooks, make sure to check around to get the best odds. As noted above, some drivers are priced much differently depending on the book, so if there's one you like, shop around. For instance, Hamlin is the +900 favorite to win at DraftKings but can be had for +1500 at Fanatics and FanDuel, and you can get +1600 at BetMGM on Busch,  who is a co-favorite at some books.There are also odds boosts available frequently, where you can get a larger payout than the odds suggest. At bet365, a BetBoost on Joey Logano gives you +1400 odds, as opposed to the +1200 he is listed at. On a $10 bet, that means instead of a $120 profit, you can walk away with $140. Parlays also are available, with DraftKings among those offering pre-set same-race plays, and most books let you build your own.      Place your Daytona 500 bets at Caesars Sportsbook here:Responsible gamingAll bettors should practice responsible gaming and use the tools at their disposal, like setting betting activity alerts and taking timeouts. DraftKings and BetMGM offer live chat features on their platforms for users to get in touch with support 24/7, and all sportsbooks have contact information for helplines like 1-800-GAMBLER for those who need additional assistance.FAQCan you bet on the Daytona 500?Yes, you can bet on the Daytona 500 at all the major sportsbooks, with odds available on the winning driver, race team or manufacturer and many other NASCAR props on drivers and teams. There also are options for stage winners, top-5 and top-10 finishes, fastest lap, head-to-head matchups and who will win among a specified group of drivers, among many other wagers. Which sportsbooks offer betting on the Daytona 500?All major sportsbooks like bet365, BetMGM, Caesars, DraftKings, Fanatics and FanDuel offer betting on NASCAR and the Daytona 500. Many sportsbooks even offer live betting so bettors can get a feel for the race and get better odds as it progresses. Where can you find Daytona 500 betting odds?You can find NASCAR betting odds at any sportsbook that offers bets on the 2026 Daytona 500, such as DraftKings, Fanatics, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars and bet365.When can I bet on the Daytona 500?You can place wagers on NASCAR and the Daytona 500 at any time from the time odds are available until the green flag drops.

    "body": "\n        The PGA Tour's first signature event of the 2026 season enters the weekend with a stacked leaderboard at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Reigning champion Rory McIlroy is making his season debut stateside, but he appears to have ejected in Round 3, while a par in the first round from world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler has him fighting from far behind at Pebble Beach Golf Links in California.Joining them among the top names in the field is last week's winner, Chris Gotterup, who has a pair of victories already in 2026 looked poised to surge again at Pebble Beach only to fall back in the second round. Like McIlroy, Pebble Beach is our first look at Tour Championship winner Tommy Fleetwood, as he enters 2026 with lofty expectations after finally breaking through at East Lake last August.Akshay Bhatia, Ryo Hisatsune, Sam Burns, Rickie Fowler, Xander Schauffele and Jordan Spieth are among the biggest names in contention after 36 holes. Each will aim to utilize Moving Day to its fullest extent, putting himself in position for a final-round run Sunday for a significant $3.6 million winner's payout.Here's how you'll be able to follow all the action on the picturesque California coast this week in the biggest event of the season thus far. 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am TV schedule All times EasternRound 3 - SaturdayRound 3 starts: 11:30 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 11:30 a.m. - 8 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports App\nLive TV coverage: 3-7 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-7 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports AppRadio: 2-7 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio Round 4 - SundayRound 4 starts: 11:30 a.m. [Tee times]PGA Tour Live: 11:30 a.m. - 8 p.m. -- PGA Tour LiveEarly TV coverage: 1-3 p.m. on Golf ChannelEarly streaming: 1-3 p.m. on NBC Sports AppLive TV coverage: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBS, Paramount+Live streaming: 3-6:30 p.m. on CBSSports.com, CBS Sports App\nRadio: 1-6:30 p.m. -- PGA Tour Radio \n            ",

    "body": "\n        The NASCAR Cup Series begins its 2026 season on Sunday, Feb. 15 with the 68th running of the Daytona 500. It was announced Saturday that the start time for \"The Great American Race\" was pushed up an hour to 1:30 p.m. ET on FOX, Fox One, MRN Radio and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio. Forecast calls for scattered showers and thunderstorms at Daytona International Speedway this weekend, potentially causing delays or interruptions to the race schedule.The drivers will race 200 laps around a 2.5-mile track, all hoping to be the one to hoist the Harley J. Earl Trophy in Victory Lane. The Daytona 500 has opened the NASCAR season every February since 1982.The NASCAR website says it is \"considered the most prestigious and important race in NASCAR.\"William Byron won last year's Daytona 500, marking his second victory in as many years. He is one of two active drivers with multiple victories in the race, alongside Denny Hamlin who has taken three checkered flags in the event. With a win, Byron would become the first driver to ever win the Daytona 500 back-to-back-to-back.Richard Petty is the all-time Daytona 500 win leader with seven and Cale Yarborough has four. Hamlin has a chance to tie for second-best all time and he's high in the conversation for drivers who could take the win. Ryan Blaney, who is after his first Daytona 500 win, and Joey Logano, who hasn't won it since 2015, are also two drivers to watch on Sunday. Last year's champ, Byron, clearly can not be ruled out either.\nSinger Miranda Lambert will perform ahead of the action and actor Kurt Russell will lead the field to the green flag.This year's race marks the 25th anniversary of the death of NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt Sr., who died in a crash on the last lap in 2001. He has one Daytona 500 win, but he still holds the all-time record for total victories at Daytona International Speedway with 34.Where to watch the Daytona 500Date: Sunday, Feb. 15 | Time: 1:30 p.m. ETLocation: Daytona International Speedway -- Daytona Beach, FloridaTV: Fox | Stream: Fubo (try for free) | Radio: MRN Radio, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio\nDaytona 500 starting lineup1.

Over the course of those two weeks, athletes from 92 countries -- not including Russia or Belarus -- will compete in 16 different sports.At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the United States finished tied for third in the gold medal count, just behind Norway and Germany. The U.S. brought home nine gold medals, which was tied with China in that category, but the Americans finished fifth in the overall medal count with 25.Team USA will try to improve upon those numbers in 2026, and they have some golden opportunities to do just that. Both the men's and women's hockey team should be in the running for a gold medal, Jordan Stolz is a favorite in speed skating, Chloe Kim is hitting the halfpipe in snowboarding and Mikaela Shiffrin will once again be on the ski slopes. And figure skaters Alysa Liu and Ilia Malinin have high potential to reach the podium.\nNorway will attempt to defend its title as the most awarded country in the Winter Olympics, both from 2022 and all-time. The Norwegians won 16 gold medals and 37 total medals at the Beijing Games four years ago, and they possess a large edge in the all-time medal count. Norway has won 148 gold medals and 406 total medals in its 24 appearances at the Winter Olympics. The Americans are a distant second with 330 total medals.Russian and Belarusian athletes are permitted to compete, but only as individuals under a neutral flag. They'll be classified as \"Individual Neutral Athletes,\" and their medals won't factor into the overall count. Russian and Belarusian teams are still banned from competing the Olympics.\nKeep track of the live medal count over the next couple weeks as the United States looks to fill up its trophy case while competing across Northern Italy.

    "body": "\nIf you're a college basketball fan, Saturday's a good day to stay on the couch. The weekend kicks off with a full slate of games, but Saturday's schedule is extra eventful as there are a whopping four games consisting of ranked foes on each side: No. 20 Clemson at No. 4 Duke, No. 9 Kansas at No. 5 Iowa State, No. 25 Kentucky at No. 14 Florida and No. 16 Texas Tech at No. 1 Arizona. Additionally, while the NBA is on its All-Star Break, Saturday is a fun day on the hardwood with the skills contests occurring, such as the dunk and 3-point contests, along with the return of the Shooting Stars competition. And if you'd rather check out what's going on over on the ice rather than the hardwood, Team USA's men's hockey team is back in action for its second game of the 2026 Winter Olympics, taking on Denmark in a preliminary round matchup starting at 3:10 p.m. ET.Below is a snapshot of what to watch and bet on at the top sportsbooks on Saturday, Feb. 14. All times Eastern. NBA best bets today, where to watchNBA Skills ChallengesTime: 5 p.m. ET | Location: Inglewood, Calif. | TV: NBA | Stream: PeacockAll-Star Weekend kicked off Friday night with the Rising Stars tournament, and on Saturday we've got the Shooting Stars contest along with the dunk and 3-point competitions. Shooting Stars is back for the first time in 11 years. Four teams of three will have 70 seconds to score as many points as possible from seven different locations on the court. Each team has two current players along with one NBA legend, and Team Knicks, consisting of Jalen Brunson, Karl-Anthony Towns and Allan Houston, is the favorite over Team Cameron (former Duke players), Team All-Stars and Team Harper (Ron Harper and his two sons). The 3-point contest has some big names, with two-time champ Damian Lillard and 2018 champ Devin Booker among the biggest stars in the competition. All-Stars Tyrese Maxey, Jamal Murray and Donovan Mitchell are also taking part in the exhibition. The betting favorite is a rookie, however, in Kon Knueppel. The Charlotte star is averaging nearly 19 points per game this year and is making 43.1% of his 3-point tries. And, of course, there's the dunk contest. As has been the case for a while, no big-name superstars are taking part in the competition, but Orlando's Jase Richardson is the son of two-time dunk champ Jason Richardson. Rounding out the field are San Antonio's Carter Bryant, the Lakers' Jaxson Hayes and Miami's Keshad Johnson.College basketball best bets today, where to watchNo. 9 Kansas at No. 5 Iowa StateTime: 1 p.m. ET | Location: Ames, Iowa | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Iowa State -7.5 \nMaybe the biggest game of the day on Saturday is an early one as a pair of top-10 teams clash in a Big 12 tilt. Kansas is 19-5 overall and 9-2 in conference play and has won eight in a row. Iowa State is 21-3 overall and 8-3 in Big 12 play, and the Cyclones are coming off a loss at TCU on Tuesday that snapped a five-game winning streak. As has been the case all season long, keep an eye on Darryn Peterson's status as the star Jayhawk and top NBA Draft prospect missed yet another game this week, this time against Arizona due to illness. The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates every college basketball game 10,000 times, likes Iowa State at home as the Cyclones cover as 7.5-point favorites in nearly 60% of simulations.No. 25 Kentucky Wildcats at No. 14 Florida GatorsTime: 3 p.m. ET | Location: Gainesville, Fla. | TV: ABC | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Kentucky +13.5\nThe two top teams in the SEC meet Saturday afternoon with the defending national champs, the Gators, hosting the Wildcats. Florida enters the weekend 18-6 overall and 9-2 in SEC play, and the Gators have won four in a row. The Wildcats are winners of three straight and are 17-7 overall and 8-3 in SEC play. This is a matchup of the two best defenses the SEC has to offer, as Kentucky ranks first in the conference at 69.5 points per game allowed while Florida is close behind at 71.0 allowed per contest. The model expects a Florida victory at home, where the Gators are 10-1, but it thinks the Wildcats will cover a wide 13.5-point spread. That occurs in 65% of model simulations.No. 16 Texas Tech Red Raiders at No. 1 Arizona WildcatsTime: 6:30 p.m. ET | Location: Tuscon, Ariz. | TV: ESPN | Stream: Fubo (try for free)SportsLine pick -- Model: Texas Tech +9.5\nArizona finally dropped a game this season, and the nation's No. 1-ranked team enters Saturday aiming to bounce back from a close loss to Kansas. The Wildcats may very well remain atop the next AP poll as they're 23-1 and 10-1 in conference play, though they face a tough matchup on Saturday with Texas Tech, which is 18-6 overall and 8-3 in Big 12 play. The Red Raiders are winners of two straight after a close loss to Kansas last week. Arizona's offense is elite, averaging 88.8 points per game, tops in the Big 12, and it is fifth in scoring defense at 67.8 points per game allowed. The Red Raiders are seventh in the conference in scoring offense (82.2 ppg) and eighth in defense (72.3 ppg). The model likes the Wildcats to recover from that setback against Kansas with a win at home, though it thinks the Red Raiders will cover as that occurs in 56% of simulations.Winter Olympics hockey best bets today, where to watchTeam USA vs. Team DenmarkTime: 3:10 p.m. ET | Location: Italy | TV: USA Network | Stream: Fubo (Try for free)The Americans are back for their second matchup of the Olympics, this time against Denmark. Team USA kicked off its quest for gold with a thorough 5-1 win over Latvia on Thursday. Saturday's matchup with Denmark is Team USA's second of three preliminary games before playoff competition kicks off. Canada is the odds-on favorite to win gold once again, while the Americans offer the second-shortest odds at sportsbooks. Team USA hasn't won gold in men's hockey since the 1980 Miracle on Ice team. The Americans are 4.5-goal favorites over Team Denmark, per DraftKings odds, and the Over/Under for total goals scored is 6.5. Denmark has the longest odds in the 12-team field to win gold at +100000.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        The 2026 NBA Slam Dunk Contest field is set, and four high-flyers will be dunking for the trophy on Saturday evening in Los Angeles. This year's Dunk Contest field is light on star power. and the headlining event on Saturday night will be extremely light on star power. Jaxson Hayes of the Los Angeles Lakers, Carter Bryant of the San Antonio Spurs, Keshad Johnson of the Miami Heat and Jase Richardson of the Orlando Magic will be the four competing for the crown. The field does not have an All-Star in it, but Bryant, Johnson and Richardson will inject a bit of youth into the proceedings. We've seen in the past that sometimes the unknown competitors can breathe some life into the event. That's certainly what the NBA will hope for, but fans will likely enter the night a bit skeptical that the Dunk Contest will deliver high marks. Hayes recently went between the legs for a slam on a fastbreak against the Chicago Bulls and is known for his high-flying theatrics. Hayes, a 7-footer, is averaging 6.4 points and 3.8 rebounds per game this season for the Lakers.\nBryant, an athletic first-year player out of Arizona, has played in 40 games this season as a first-round pick. He is averaging 2.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in 8.6 minutes per game. Richardson, a rookie out of Michigan State, has played in 36 games this season and is averaging 5.1 points per game in 12 minuter per night in Orlando. \nJohnson is in his second year in the league with the Heat and has appeared in 21 games, averaging 3.1 points per game in 7.6 minutes of action per night. 2026 NBA Dunk Contest field, odds(Odds via FanDuel)Carter Bryant, Spurs: +180Jaxson Hayes, Lakers: +240Keshad Johnson, Heat: +310Jase Richardson, Magic: +430Why is Mac McClung not in this year's Slam Dunk Contest?Three-time reigning Slam Dunk Contest champion Mac McClung will not participate in this year's event after he was waived by the Indiana Pacers in November following a three-game stint.While his NBA opportunities have been limited, McClung made a reputation as a supreme athlete with elite dunking ability. He won the league's midseason extravaganza at each of the last three All-Star weekends.

It's a star-studded field at All-Star Weekend and the two biggest favorites entering the event are a rookie and a surprising veteran. Kon Knueppel, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, enters with the best odds (+240 at DraftKings) in the eight-shooter field. Damian Lillard, who is not playing this season for the Trail Blazers as he recovers from a torn Achilles, has the second-best odds (+400).Lillard, now 35, tore his Achilles tendon in Game 4 of the Milwaukee Bucks' first-round series against the Indiana Pacers, a devastating end to a disappointing two seasons in Milwaukee. The Bucks waived him in July, and he returned to Portland -- where he spent the first 11 years of his career and made seven All-NBA teams -- on a three-year, $42 million deal.Lillard won the 3-Point Contest in 2023 and 2024. He is one of eight players to win the contest multiple times, and only two players -- Larry Bird and Craig Hodges -- have won it three times.\n        \n            \n                NBA All-Star Weekend predictions: Expert picks for 3-point Contest, ASG MVP and more\n                \n                    Jack Maloney                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nIn order to get his third victory, Lillard will not only have to shake off some cobwebs.

It was the flagship event of the night, as the league's top players showcased their athletic feats with jaw-dropping dunks. Players who weren't competing often filled the sidelines, and fans were always enthralled by the nightcap.However, over the last 10 years, the dunk contest has lost its cachet, while the 3-Point Shootout has gotten all the hype. The 3-Point Shootout has delivered in ways the dunk contest hasn't in recent years, with nail-biting finishes as everyone watches in awe as the league's elite shooters show off their skills. While we don't get the top dunkers for All-Star Saturday night in Los Angeles, the top shooters are regularly lining up to compete in the 3-point competition, giving us a star-studded event every year.\n        \n            \n                NBA Rising Stars winners and losers: VJ Edgecombe wins MVP, Cooper Flagg misses showcase with injury\n                \n                    Cameron Salerno                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nWhile the dunk contest doesn't have high-level names, we've still seen some impressive dunks in the last two years thanks to two-time champion Mac McClung, who has decided not to defend his title this weekend. As we prepare for the night's festivities, here's everything you need to know.Bet NBA All-Star Saturday at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:\nHow to watch All-Star Saturday nightTime: 5 p.m. ET | Date: Saturday, Feb. 14Location: Intuit Dome -- Los AngelesTV channel: NBC | Live stream: PeacockThe 3-Point Shootout will be the first event of the night.

    "body": "\n        This weekend in La Liga, as Real Sociedad hosts Real Madrid, the two longest current unbeaten streaks in league play come to a head. Neither team has lost in its last seven matches as Sociedad have picked up four wins and three draws while Real Madrid have won seven in a row. Sociedad are doing it under American manager Pellegrino Matarazzo in a turnaround that is nothing short of impressive. How to watch Real Madrid vs. Real Sociedad, oddsDate: Saturday, Feb. 14 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Estadio Santiago Bernabéu -- Madrid, SpainLive stream: ESPN+Odds: Real Madrid -263; Draw +425;  Real Sociedad +600Get ready for the Knockout Stage like never before with the UEFA Champions League Bracket Games!

But fast forward nine matches and Matarazzo's team haven't lost a single match under his leadership. Mattarazo spent over a year out of a job after being let go by Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga, but he's in the midst of one of his best spells as a manager while getting acclimated to LaLiga. While with Hoffenheim, Mattarazo was reportedly linked to the United States men's national team job before Mauricio Pochettino was hired, but opted to stay at the club. And with how things are going currently, both for the USMNT and Sociedad, that may be for the best. Below is a chart of Sociedad's Expected Goals trends for the last 29 matches, and it's clear where Mattarazo took over.\n\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Looking at the improvements around match 20 on the chart, he has this team performing to the top of their abilities without making major changes to personnel. New manager bounces are one thing, but Real Sociedad have already beaten Barcelona and drawn Atletico Madrid under Matarazzo and are now 90 minutes from making an appearance in the Copa Del Rey final. He's already made history as the first American manager in LaLiga, and while it's a short list of American managers to take the reins in a top five league, if he can keep this up, Matarazzo can become the first American manager to manage in European competition since Jesse Marsch and David Wagner did it during the 2021-22 season with Red Bull Leipzig and Young Boys respectively.After selling stars like Alexander Isak, Mikel Merino, and Martin Zubimendi to the Premier League, Sociedad needed a rebuild, and Matarazzo has been the right guy for the job so far, helping put their academy players into the best position to succeed while getting the most out of additions like Goncalo Guedes.\nFor their next task, Sociedad will need to push their press to the next level in order to get past yet another new manager in Alvaro Arbeola's Real Madrid. Even with that seven-match winning streak in LaLiga, Real Madrid have been vulnerable, relying on Kylian Mbappe's unstoppable form in attack to get them through matches. But with the Frenchman missing two consecutive training sessions due to a knee injury, he could be a game-time decision, raising Sociedad's chances of winning the match.Mbappe has 23 LaLiga goals and 38 goals in all competitions this season, and while you always want to beat a team when they're at their best, no one wants to attempt to defend against Mbappe when he's in this form. Real Sociedad's press will give them a chance to keep this close, but even if this is where Matarazzo's run comes to an end, the effects of his management are already being seen.\n                                                                    CBS Sports\n                                                            Real Sociedad have risen to eighth place in LaLiga, only three points out of a Europa Conference League place, and there's no reason why they can't dream of overtaking Real Betis for a Europa Leauge spot. Things that felt improbable could be in reach if what Matarazzo has built can continue to be something sustainable in the long haul.\n            ",

This is the seventh time that the annual showcase has been in the City of Angels, but the first time that the Clippers will be the sole hosts.All of the action will take place at the new Intuit Dome, which opened last season. The Clippers' arena, which cost $2 billion, has drawn rave reviews from fans and players alike, and will become the center of the basketball world for three days. Bet NBA All-Star Weekend at DraftKings Sportsbook, where new users get $300 in bonus bets with a winning $5 wager:The primary events are all back, but there are plenty of questions about the weekend. The Slam Dunk Contest remains devoid of stars, while the All-Star Game format has been tweaked once again. This time, it's Team USA vs. Team USA vs. Team World. The All-Star selections have been separated into three teams and will compete in a round-robin tournament. The league hopes that pitting Americans against international players will generate a more competitive environment, but we'll have to wait until Sunday to see if that makes a difference. Ahead of this

functioning Achilles would make for a great story. (Please do not get hurt doing this.) I went with the World winning the game and Wemby taking MVP because he seems to be one of the few All-Stars who actually wants to be there. You'll remember him getting ticked off at Anthony Edwards in the skills competition when Ant decided to shoot left handed for the lols. As for the dunk contest, there are no actual winners here -- certainly not the fans. We can't even get a Shaedon Sharpe for this thing?Herbert: The theme here is that I think the guys I picked will take this stuff seriously. The 3-point field is loaded, so Knueppel might be a bold choice, but his form is picture-perfect and should translate to the contest. For the All-Star \"Game,\" I just picked the team that I thought would try the hardest. (I was tempted to take Team World, but, historically, Nikola Jokić and Luka Dončić have not expended much energy on this stage.) I can see Cunningham and Jalen Duren setting a competitive tone, especially with J.B. Bickerstaff coaching them. My real dunk contest pick is ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯, but I went with Bryant, who says he already knows what he's going to do with his first three dunks.Maloney: Knueppel is a rookie, so you do have to wonder how he'll handle the bright lights of All-Star Weekend, but he's already established himself as one of the best pure shooters in the league and has made 45.9% of his open or wide-open 3s this season. My Dunk Contest pick is admittedly a shot in the dark, but I think Johnson will have something to prove given his status as a relative unknown. I'm going with Team World to win the All-Star Game and Victor Wembanyama to take home MVP. Even with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sidelined due to injury, Team World is the most talented bunch, and Wembanyama has made it abundantly clear that he's taking this more seriously than everyone else. \nSalerno: If you watched the movie \"Hustle,\" you know Kermit Wilts, AKA Anthony Edwards, loves competition. In this kind of format/showcase, guards tend to dominate. I'm going with Edwards, -- and, by extension, the USA Stars team -- to have a night to remember in Southern California. The new format hopefully will inject new life into the ASG. On Saturday night, I'm expecting the favorites to pull through.\n            \n    \n\n        \n    \n                        ",

    "body": "\n        The college football offseason is so ripe for discourse about eligibility lawsuits and NIL debacles that we can lose sight of what makes the sport so enjoyable. This Valentine's Day, why not relish in everything there is love about college football? After witnessing one of the most unpredictable seasons of all time and watching Indiana pull off the greatest underdog story we've ever seen, it is not hard to remind ourselves of everything that draws us back into stadium seats and in front of our TVs every fall.There is so much to be excited about in the lead-up to the 2026 season. An unbelievably busy coaching carousel cycle produced countless hires that give fanbases something to believe in. Some of the top NFL Draft prospects elected to return to college, giving their teams reasons to believe they can win a national championship. The transfer portal helped perennial contenders reload and gear up for another run to the College Football Playoff.On a day where love is in the air, there is no better time to give college football its flowers.Here are 10 things to love about college football ahead of the 2026 season.Championship contender we have a soft spot for: TexasThis is an all-in year for Texas. Arch Manning is back with a year of starting experience under his belt and like a superstar in the making down the stretch in 2025. Colin Simmons returns to headline another stacked defense. And on top of it all, the Longhorns opened up their checkbook and spent big on some of the most elite talent in the transfer portal; wide receiver Cam Coleman should take the aerial game to another level while Raleek Brown and Hollywood Smothers figure to anchor a potent rushing attack. The star power is simply off the charts on what should be the most talented roster of the Steve Sarkisian era. If not now, when will Sark reach the mountaintop?\nCoaching hire we're captivated by: Lane Kiffin to LSULane Kiffin was an obvious \"A+\" hire for LSU. Any number of hires could pan out in extraordinary fashion (like the tremendous fit Virginia Tech found with James Franklin), but any conversation about the 2026 coaching carousel has to start and end in Baton Rouge. Not only was the Tigers' pursuit of Kiffin as dramatic of a search as college football has seen, but it also legitimizes the national championship aspirations that LSU holds every single season. This is one of the most elite coaches in the sport, and his work in the transfer portal gives him a shot to win at the highest level straight away.Transfer fit we're infatuated with: Josh Hoover to IndianaHas any program mastered the art of transfer quarterback evaluations as well as Indiana over the last two cycles? The results suggest the Hoosiers know exactly what they're doing. Josh Hoover looks to be next in line in a fraternity of elite Indiana signal-callers. As a one-time commit as a high school recruit, Hoover already knows what he is walking into in Bloomington. As a rising star in the Big 12, he brings a high ceiling to the Big Ten. And in a Mike Shanahan offense that just produced a Heisman Trophy winner, he could put the Hoosiers right back in national championship contention. This is a match made in heaven.Nonconference game we're enamored with: Ohio State at TexasMarquee non-conference matchups are fewer and further between than ever before as teams seek to minimize early-season risk. That will not stop Ohio State and Texas from honoring the second leg of their home-and-home contract, though. Last season's opener pitted the No. 1 and No. 2 teams against each other, and both sides will be right back in the national championship hunt when they meet in Week 2 this time around. Props to two preeminent brands for giving fans the type of September showdown they crave.\nTrue freshman we adore: Keisean Henderson, HoustonHouston signed the highest-rated recruit in school history and beat a handful of blue bloods in doing so. The excitement around five-star quarterback Keisean Henderson is justified. This is the kind of program-altering acquisition that could launch Houston into a new realm as a Big 12 championship contender and CFP dark horse as soon as this year. Henderson -- the No. 1 overall recruit in the 2026 class, per 247Sports -- must beat incumbent starter Conner Weigman for the job, so it is no guarantee that he cracks the starting lineup in 2026.Returning star we're smitten with: Dante Moore, OregonIf ever there was an argument that NIL is a good thing for college football, Dante Moore returning to Oregon is it. Moore is still likely missing out on millions of dollars this year by passing on the opportunity to be an early first-round NFL Draft pick, but that he can rejoin the Ducks, refine his craft, compete for a national championship and make plenty of money in the process is a major win for the sport. If Moore settles down against elite defenses in 2026, it will be hard to argue against him as the best quarterback in the country and the No. 1 pick in next year's draft.Heisman hopeful we admire: Jeremiah Smith, Ohio StateIs this the year for Jeremiah Smith? He was a top-flight wide receiver as a true freshman and the sixth-place finisher in Heisman Trophy voting as a sophomore, so it feels as though everything is building toward him winning college football's biggest award as a junior. Smith's supporting cast will remain potent enough to prevent defenses from loading up on him, paving the way for another 1,200-yard, 12-touchdown season like the last two. As his chemistry with Julian Sayin continues to strengthen, the Ohio State superstar will be on the receiving end of arguably the greatest quarterback-wideout duo in the nation.\nBounce-back team we're falling for: Oklahoma StateOklahoma State fans endured two horrendous years to conclude the Mike Gundy era but look poised to enjoy a rapid rebound. Hiring Eric Morris away from North Texas gives the Cowboys a promising up-and-comer in the coaching ranks, and the players he is bringing with him are nothing short of studs. Behind Drew Mestemaker's nation-leading 312.8 passing yards per game and Caleb Hawkins' FBS-best 25 rushing touchdowns, the Mean Green led college football in scoring and total offense last season by a wide margin. Both stars are headed to Oklahoma State as the faces of what should be a quick rebuild. A bowl game feels like a reasonable expectation for a Cowboys team that won just one game last fall.Conference we cherish: Pac-12Move over, Big Ten and SEC, there is a new boss in town. OK, that's an exaggeration -- but the Pac-12 making its grand return is an exciting comeback two years in the making. This is not the Pac-12 of old, sure, but its emergence as the potential ringleader at the Group of Six level brings new intrigue to the race for the fifth CFP spot. Boise State is a regular in the playoff conversation, and both Oregon State and Washington State are former power conference darlings who should be well positioned to compete at the top of this reimagined league. Add a couple of other former Mountain West contenders plus Texas State to the mix, and this is as formidable of a conference as any outside the Power Four.Rematch we idolize: Notre Dame vs. MiamiIn hindsight, the 2025 season opener between Notre Dame and Miami was one of the most impactful games of the entire campaign. A head-to-head win in that contest that ultimately launched the Hurricanes into the CFP and opened the door for their run to the national championship game. Think the Fighting Irish want to exact revenge when these squads square off for the second leg of their home-and-home? No doubt. Both should be right back in the playoff hunt, and it is hard to imagine a scenario in which their rematch does not again factor heavily into that race.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        Wisconsin is shaping up to be the sort of team that a No. 1 or No. 2 seed would dread seeing in their pod when the 2026 NCAA Tournament bracket is revealed next month. The Badgers' 92-71 win over Michigan State on Friday night only added to their growing reputation as dragon slayers in the Big Ten.The loss dropped the Spartans from a No. 3 seed in the CBS Sports Bracketology model to a No. 4 seed. Wisconsin is now the best-ranked No. 8 seed in the field and is well-positioned to rise once the full rundown of results from Saturday and Sunday are factored into the model.Coming just three days after an upset win at Illinois, the 21-point drubbing of the Spartans was another indicator of how potent Wisconsin can be offensively. A program that used to play slow and with an interior focus now plays with tempo a quick 3-point trigger. Friday night marked the fifth time the Badgers have hit 15 or more 3-pointers in a game this season. The guard duo of Nick Boyd and John Blackwell is performing as one of the best in all of college basketball. They combined for 53 points against Michigan State, and both rank among the top-10 scorers in the Big Ten. Again, that's a team no well-seeded team would want fo face in the second round.\nHeading into a big Saturday of action, here's the breakdown of where things stand along the top lines in CBS Sports Bracketology.

By contrast, this team is 3-5 when making fewer than 10 shots from beyond the arc. Living and dying by the 3-pointer is a notoriously risky way to live, but it has proven effective as of late in resurrecting the Badgers from a shaky start to their 2025-26 season.Wisconsin's at-large prospects looked murky after a 7-4 start that included losses to TCU, Nebraska and Villanova. At the time, though, it was unclear just how good those teams truly were. Nebraska and Villanova and are projected to make the field as at-large teams. TCU is a bubble team that has shown the ability to slay giants. The Badgers are 9-7 in Quads 1 and 2 and unbeaten in Quads 3 and 4. Following its win over the Spartans, Wisconsin is up to No. 25 in Wins Above Bubble (WAB), which is a critical resume metric used by the selection committee. The Badgers are also on the rise in predictive analytics.\nWAB measures how many wins a team has on the season vs. how many wins an average bubble team would have vs. the same schedule.\n        \n            \n                Bracketology Bubble Watch: Texas A&M hanging onto spot in field of 68; TCU vs. Oklahoma State has high stakes\n                \n                    David Cobb                \n            \n                            \n    \n                \n                    \n    \nMichigan State stallingMichigan State has lost three of its last four games since starting 19-2. Now 20-5 (10-4 Big Ten), the Spartans have stalled out a bit. That's not entirely uncommon for this program. A year ago, Michigan State started 18-2, but then dropped three of its first four games in February against mid-tier Big Ten opposition.From there, the Spartans won seven straight to close the regular season and beat six NCAA Tournament teams in the process. The ride didn't end until the Elite Eight. You can never count out a team coached by Tom Izzo, and these Spartans will have ample opportunity to get back onto the No. 3 seed line. If they close the regular season like they did last season, a No. 2 seed could still be on the table as well.\n            ",

    "body": "\n        After a 2024 season in which Scottie Scheffler claimed half of the PGA Tour's signature events, all eight were won by different players in 2025. Parity was the name of the game as winner's checks worth $3.6 million and $4 million for the player invitationals were doled out to a variety of names, including not only Scheffler but Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, among others.This week, the 2026 signature events get underway as the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am takes center stage. McIlroy enters as the reigning champion after kicking off a memorable spring in California last year, not only winning at Pebble Beach but adding The Players Championship and his first Masters green jacket to three early season wins. He will be playing his first PGA Tour event of 2026, as will Tommy Fleetwood, who won the FedEx Cup a year ago.The stakes are elevated when a signature event falls on the calendar, which means the payouts are raised, too. Not only will $3.6 million of the $20 million purse be awarded to the winner, every player inside the top 10 will clear $500,000 and those inside the top 20 will each earn north of $250,000.Let's take a look at how the payouts for the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am will be divided among the 80 players at Pebble Beach Golf Links.2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am prize money, purseTotal Purse: $20 million\n1st: $3,600,0002nd: $2,160,0003rd: $1,360,0004th: $960,0005th: $795,0006th: $715,0007th: $665,0008th: $615,0009th: $575,00010th: $535,00011th: $495,00012th: $455,00013th: $415,00014th: $375,00015th: $352,00016th: $332,00017th: $312,00018th: $292,00019th: $272,00020th: $252,00021st: $232,00022nd: $217,00023rd: $202,00024th: $187,00025th: $172,00026th: $158,00027th: $150,00028th: $143,00029th: $137,00030th: $131,00031st: $125,00032nd: $119,00033rd: $114,00034th: $109,00035th: $104,00036th: $99,00037th: $94,00038th: $89,00039th: $84,00040th: $80,00041st: $76,00042nd: $72,00043rd: $68,00044th: $64,00045th: $60,00046th: $57,00047th: $54,00048th: $52,00049th: $50,00050th: $48,00051st: $47,00052nd: $46,00053rd: $45,00054th: $44,00055th: $43,00056th: $42,00057th: $41,00058th: $40,00059th: $39,50060th: $39,00061st: $38,50062nd: $38,00063rd: $37,50064th: $37,00065th: $36,50066th: $36,00067th: $35,50068th: $35,00069th: $34,75070th: $34,50071st: $34,25072nd: $34,00073rd: $33,75074th: $33,50075th: $33,25076th: $33,00077th: $32,75078th: $32,50079th: $32,25080th: $32,000\n            ",

The single-elimination semifinals will feature Kelsey Plum vs. Chelsea Gray and Allisha Gray vs. Aliyah Boston. The winners of those matchups will advance to the best-of-three finals, which will take place immediately following the semis. Plum advanced to this stage with a shutout victory over Natisha Hiedeman in the second round and a hard-fought win over No. 1 seed Kelsey Mitchell in the quarterfinals. Gray, meanwhile, knocked out Las Vegas Aces teammate Jackie Young in the second round before easily dispatching a frustrated Paige Bueckers -- also a No. 1 seed. Gray is the lone No. 1 seed to reach the semis. She escaped a tough battle with Saniya Rivers in the second round before cruising past Rae Burrell in the quarters. Boston had a similar experience, as she eked out a win over Breanna Stewart in the second round, then shut out Aaliyah Edwards in the quarters. All four remaining players are guaranteed a share of the $300,000 prize pool. The two players that lose in the semis will receive $25,000, while the runner-up will take home $50,000 and the champion will earn $200,000 -- nearly a max contract in the previous WNBA CBA. Ahead of Saturday's conclusion, here's everything you need to know about Unrivaled's 1-on-1 tournament. ScheduleSemifinals and championshipSaturday, Feb. 14, 6 p.m. ET -- TNT / tru TV / HBO MaxBracketUnrivaled expanded to six teams and 48 players this season, but only 32 were initially scheduled to participate in the 1-on-1 tournament. The players were split into four, eight-player pods based on position. Fans, players, coaches and media then voted to determine the seeding in each pod. Due to withdrawals, however, only 27 players ended up competing. Skylar Diggins, Jordin Canada, Kahleah Copper, Rickea Jackson and Alyssa Thomas all dropped out. Laeticia Amihere, who was briefly set to replace Thomas, ended up backing out at the last minute. Additionally, Tiffany Hayes was replaced by Aziaha James. Here's a look at the updated bracket:\nQuarterfinal resultsPod ANo. 2 Kelsey Plum def.
